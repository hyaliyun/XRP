The series is licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment (as Witch Buster) and released in omnibus format. The series is also licensed in France by Ki-Oonhttp://www.manga- news.com/index.php/serie/Witch-Hunter and Italy by Jpop. Plot In a world where witches have declared war against humanity, causing two-thirds of the world to fall apart, the surviving human population has gathered specialists with the power to hunt and destroy witches. Tasha Godspell, also known as the \\"Magic Marksman,\\" is one of the best Witch Hunters there is. Along with his sword-wielding Jack-o‚Äô-Lantern partner known as Halloween, Tasha puts his magical training and weaponry to good use, in his constant battles against witches. And yet, he cannot bring himself to fully hate the very witches he is tasked to destroy. Terminology ;Witches :Witches are the primary antagonists of the series. Witches were originally women or girls who have the potential to use magic and awaken, gaining a hat. Once they become witches, their personalities generally change, turning much more evil, although there are a few exceptions to this. ;Supporters :Supporters are contracted partners/servants of witches who assists their master in battle and reduce the amount of mana needed for spells. Most Supporters are either magical creatures or items but humans can also become Supporters as well if they choose so. There are two classes of supporters; A Normal one and a Spiritual one. Spiritual supporters only die when their master dies and require nearly no mana. If a supporter is stronger than the witch, then they may break free from them. They also have a heart that receives mana that if destroyed, die as well. ;Witch Hats :A witch's mana are stored in their hats and as such is a witch's most treasured possession. As magic in the hat runs out, the witch's original personality surfaces. ;Mana :Mana is what allows witches and others to use magic. It's considered a poison to normal people, destroying their sanity and body except women.

Lander is an American politician, urban planner, and activist serving as a member of the New York City Council for the 39th District. The district includes portions of Boerum Hill, Borough Park, Brooklyn Heights, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Flatbush, Gowanus, Green-Wood Cemetery, Kensington, Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Prospect Park, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Red Hook, South Slope, Sunset Park and Windsor Terrace. Early life and education Lander, a Missouri native, grew up in St. Louis in a Reform Jewish family. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago where he received the Harry S. Truman Scholarship, and a Master's degree in anthropology from University College London on a Marshall Scholarship, and a Master's degree in urban planning from the Pratt Institute. Early career Lander directed the Pratt Center for Community Development and Fifth Avenue Committee. He served for a decade as executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee, a not-for-profit community-based organization that develops and manages affordable housing. As a director, Lander won local and national recognition for his work at FAC including the 2000 New York Magazine Civics Award, and the 2002 Leadership for a Changing World award, sponsored by the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Sustainable Communities. In 1999, Rolling Stone Magazine awarded Lander the \\"Do Something Brick Award\\" for his community work in affordable housing advocacy. Other awards from the Ford Foundation, the Fannie Mae Foundation and the University of Chicago were granted throughout his tenure as a director. Lander is the former Director of the Pratt Center for Community Development. He stepped down after six years as head of the organization to seek a seat on the New York City Council. He teaches community planning, housing, and urban policy at Brooklyn Law School. As the director of the Pratt Center, Lander has been a critic of the Bloomberg administration's development policies. He has also been a critic of the Atlantic Yards project. Lander's work in 2003‚Äì2005 on the Greenpoint- Williamsburg rezoning led to the first New York City inclusionary housing program to create affordable housing in new development outside Manhattan. Lander served on a mayoral taskforce that recommended reforms to the 421-a tax exemption for luxury housing and required that new development in certain areas of the city set aside affordable housing units. He co-led the completion of the One City One Future platform, a progressive vision for economic development in New York City. Political career=New York City Council= Lander was first elected to office on the Democratic Party and Working Families Party lines on November 4, 2009, with 70% of the vote. Lander won a hotly contested Democratic Primary on September 15, 2009 with 41% of the vote in a field of five. Lander was reelected on the Democratic and Working Families Parties' lines on November 5, 2013 to serve for a second term. Lander is a co-founder of the Progressive Caucus in the New York City Council, a group that was described by the New York Times as \\"the City Council‚Äôs most liberal members.\\" For his first term, Brad shared the title of Co-Chair of this caucus with his Manhattan colleague Melissa Mark-Viverito, who was unanimously elected Speaker of the City Council in early 2014. Lander was one of four original Council Members to bring participatory budgeting to New York City, a project that allows citizens to directly propose, develop, and vote on items in the municipal budget. Over half of the 51 New York City Council Districts now engage in Participatory Budgeting. Lander opposed rezoning the site of Long Island College Hospital to include affordable housing. As of July 2017, he was the primary sponsor of 20 Local Laws enacted by the City Council and signed by the Mayor. In addition to these efforts, Lander played a prominent role in helping shepherd the Community Safety Act to passage, in partnership with Council Member Jumaane Williams. By April 2020, Lander had sponsored over 2,254 article of legislation. City and State New York ranked Councilmember Lander in the lower half of NYC Lawmakers ranking him 30th out of the 51 councilmembers. Lander has drawn criticism and, in his words, \\"anger\\" and \\"suspicion\\" for vocally supporting contracts for two homeless shelters despite multiple press reports that those contracts contain up to $89 million of unexplained cost compared to contracts for equivalent shelters and that there is no apparent explanation for the increased cost. Lander also acknowledged that the contracts will benefit developers accused of wrongdoing in the past. In his second term on the Council, Lander served as the deputy leader for policy. It was during this term where he admitted to ethics violation using his position to solicit donations for a non-profit he helped to create. Lander has also been a leading advocate for a program which has moved over 9,500 homeless people to vacant hotel rooms across New York City to provide space for social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic at an average cost of $174 per room per night or $5,293 per person per month. The proposal drew intense criticism from New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's Department of Social Services, which called it ‚Äúham-fisted and reckless, self- defeatingly unilateral and ill-informed, and legally questionable and amateurish: insisting on using a one-size fits all approach for a system that is anything but, and forcing the involuntary rushed transfer of more than ten thousand people into hotels without appropriate services to match, putting individuals with higher service needs, including substance use challenges, at risk in the process.\\" Lander called DSS's concerns \\"cartoonish insults.\\" The program has also drawn strong reactions from neighborhood residents, with some residents feeling the program has led to significant increases in crime and worrying about the risk of having sex offenders housed 1-block from a public school, while other residents are more open to providing social services to those in need. =Comptroller= Facing term limits for his council seat after his second term, Lander announced he is running for New York City Comptroller in 2021. The race will be for an open position as current Comptroller, Scott Stringer, is also facing term limits and will vacate the seat.

Classical pedestrian tunnel for residents An 1821-built feature in the garden is the \\"Nursemaids' Tunnel\\", a private, communal pedestrian tunnel, rare in today's Inner London boroughs, privately linking the gardens with those of Park Crescent. Its portals are well-executed in stucco, each with fluted Doric columns flanking the arched entrances. The tunnel has groin vaults supported by brick pilasters and concave walls. The busy road was considered dangerous, especially to children who were often taken to the park by a nursemaid, leading to the wealthy to-be residents petitioning for its building.https://historicengland.org.uk/whats-new/news/21-fascinating-places- listed-in-2019/ Statutorily protected features In the highest, rarest level of listed building are both built-up sides. In the east all but the end houses comprise \\"Park Square East\\" (yet numbered 13 to 24 to avoid any confusion with 1 to 12 \\"Park Square West\\"). This exclusion of ends from the street's own numbering is mirrored on the other side. The latter likewise is Grade I-listed. The four corner houses project slightly, and co-front shorter terraces yet their design is highly similar by Nash, and of the same date. Those short perpendicular rows are recognised and protected with the same (Grade I) status: Ulster Terrace, Ulster Place, St Andrew's Place and Albany Terrace. Two small garden-keeping buildings are listed in the extreme southern corners, the garden-surrounding railings and 18 street lamps. All in the mainstream, initial category, grade II. Non-listed similar-size buildings comprise those in the northern angles: 12 Park Square East; 13 Park Square West sharing classical architectural fa√ßades, built with less expensive labour and materials.

Overview The group provides C-130 initial and tactical aircrew training in all crew positions for all of the Department of Defense and allied students from 46 nations. Units The 314th Operations Group is composed of one flying squadron and one training squadron. * The 62nd Airlift Squadron flies the C-130J Super Hercules * The 714th Training Squadron provided administrative support for all students History : See the 314th Airlift Wing for additional history and lineage =World War II= During World War II the 314th Troop Carrier Group arrived in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations in May 1943, taking part with Twelfth Air Force units in two airborne operations. It flew two major night missions in July 1943 during the Sicily invasion, dropping paratroops of 82d Airborne Division near Gela on 9 July and reinforcements to the area on the 11th. Later in the year, the group transported paratroops and supplies to Salerno, 14 and 15 September, during the invasion of Italy. Squadrons from the 314th flew additional missions in the Mediterranean before it transferred, in February 1944, to England for further training. From England, it took part with the Ninth Air Force in the Normandy invasion, flying numerous supply and reinforcement missions in the ensuing period. The 314th dropped paratroops over the Netherlands in September and carried munitions and supplies to the same area. After moving to France in late February 1945, it participated in the airborne crossings of the Rhine River near Wesel on 24 March. The group then brought supplies and equipment to combat units and airlifted wounded U.S. and Allied personnel to rear-area hospitals. After the termination of hostilities, it evacuated prisoners of war from German camps and flew regular personnel and freight service. It transferred without personnel or equipment (WOPE) to the United States in February 1946, and in September again transferred WOPE, to the Panama Canal Zone, where the 314th operated air terminals under Caribbean Air Command. It moved back to the United States in October 1948 for further training. =Cold War= 314th TCG Fairchild C-82A Packet Ashiya AB, Japan 48-575 314th TCG Fairchild C-119B Flying Boxcar 48-352 operating from a base in South Korea, 1953 Transferring without personnel or equipment (WOPE) to US in February 1946, and in Sep, again WOPE, to the Canal Zone, the 314th operated air terminals under Caribbean Air Command.

The group served in Japan during the Korean War, participating in two major airborne operations, at Sunchon in October 1950 and at Munsan-ni in March 1951. It later transported supplies to Korea and evacuated prisoners of war. In 1954, it again transferred, without personnel or equipment to the US where it participated in a continuous stream of tactical exercises and inspections until October 1957. =Modern era= Lockheed C-130K Hercules 65-13040 taking off The group flew worldwide airlift and provided all C-130 aircrew training to U.S. and allied aircrews, September 1978 ‚Äì June 1980 and from December 1991 to present.

December 7, 1923; married name: Neubauer) is the first woman assigned to perform duties aboard a United States Navy ship as part of her official responsibilities. Stern was a civilian employee at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard during World War II, working in the engineering department. Her job as a ship's draftsman included taking measurements of ship features as required by her engineer colleagues to allow them to designate the placement of upgrades such as new anti-aircraft guns. Stern‚Äôs first assignment aboard ship occurred June 29, 1943, aboard the USNS Escalante, a tanker (hull number AO70). This was followed by assignments aboard a further 229 ships before her career at the Navy yard ended in January 1946. Early life Stern was born December 7, 1923, in Norfolk, Virginia, the second of seven children of Milford Josiah Stern, a real estate and life insurance agent, and Thelma Georgia Bendler Stern, who served as a yeomanette during World War I. Prior to the Great Depression, the Stern family enjoyed a prosperous upper-middle-class lifestyle, frequently traveling between their homes in New York and Norfolk. During the Depression, a series of events dominated by the failure of Mr. Stern‚Äôs stock market investments resulted in the family‚Äôs poverty. In the early 1930s they settled into a home in Norfolk, where Mr. Stern found work to provide for the family. His death by pneumonia in 1934 left Mrs. Stern raising seven children alone, ranging in age from two to thirteen years. Mrs. Stern worked for the Virginia Statistical Bureau and often had to travel to other cities around the state for weeks at a time, leaving Thelma, the eldest daughter, largely in charge of overseeing the younger children and running the household. With the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor occurring on the morning of her 18th birthday, an outraged Thelma Stern yearned to do whatever she could to help the US war effort. Still a junior in high school, she signed up for the mechanical drawing class at her high school, a course that had previously been open only to male students. World War II career Upon graduating high school, Stern immediately applied for work in the Engineering division at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. With the available able-bodied young men being called upon to serve in the armed forces, the navy leadership needed to be creative in their approach to meeting the demanding schedules involved in upgrading the fleet with modern weapon and defensive systems. This led to opportunities for non-traditional members of the work force, and many women were ready and willing to answer the call. Stern started work in the naval shipyard‚Äôs engineering department on June 7, 1943, assigned to the weights and stability section of the hull department. Many of her civilian male colleagues were either retired from service in the Navy, or were unfit for military service ‚Äì disabled in ways that limited their ability to maneuver aboard ships, which required climbing ladders and stepping through narrow passageways. In order to accomplish work at the necessary pace, the chief engineer of the hull department used some of his female employees to obtain the precise measurements from ships as needed to engineer their defense system updates, such as placement of 40mm anti-aircraft guns. Stern was employed as a civilian. All of her duties aboard ships were performed while the ships were docked or in drydock, and never while underway. At the direction of the chief engineer, she was accompanied by an armed guard whenever performing duties aboard any vessel. The guard was always a member of the crew of the vessel being surveyed, appointed by its captain. Because of superstitions that persisted during the first half of the twentieth century, some ship captains refused to allow a female to board their ship. In those instances, the work schedule was adjusted to swap the ship that Stern had been assigned to with that of a male colleague. Post World War II life As part of the demobilization program, Stern was released from her employment at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in January 1946. She moved to Baltimore, Maryland, to accept a position as a draftsman with the Glenn L. Martin Company. There she met a fellow draftsman named Clarence Neubauer. They married in 1947 and raised five children together in Baltimore. References * The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol 100, No 3 (July 1992), p. 388\\\\.

Biography Chabrat was born in La Chambre, Savoie, to Pierre and Louise (n√©e Lavialle) Chabrat; he was a relative of Peter Joseph Lavialle, Bishop of Louisville (1865‚Äì67). He studied at a Sulpician seminary and was ordained a subdeacon in 1809.

He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Flaget on Christmas Day 1811, at St. Rose Priory. Chabrat was first assigned to St. Michael's Church in Fairfield and St. Clare's Church in Colesburg, while also attending to a mission in Poplar Neck near Bardstown. He briefly served as pastor of St. Pius' Church in Scott County (1823). Following the death of Rev. Charles Nerinckx, he became superior of the Sisters of Loretto in 1824. On March 21, 1834, Chabrat was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Bardstown and Titular Bishop of Bolina by Pope Gregory XVI.

The lodge fronts on a court, entered through a gatehouse and originally flanked by wings housing guest rooms. The property is significant as an example of a unique eclectically-style resort in eastern Wyoming. A portion of the casino was intended to serve as a memorial to Cambria-area miners. The dance hall opened on January 12, 1929. Seventy- five guests could be accommodated in the main building and in six cottages. The cottages have since been removed. The resort featured a freshwater pool fed by Salt Creek and a saltwater pool fed from salt springs about away. The interior features a second floor ballroom with a timber-framed roof resembling a medieval hammer-beam truss. The timbers may have come from area mines. Beneath the ballroom were a dining room, auxiliary dining room, kitchen sitting room and six guest rooms. The Cambria Casino was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

This was the last of five albums Martin released in 1966, it was named to capitalise on the immense success of his television show, The Dean Martin Show. The Dean Martin TV Show peaked at 34 on the Billboard 200, and was still on the charts in Spring 1967. The album is not a soundtrack of The Dean Martin Show. Eschewing his recent country pop style, The Dean Martin TV Show was a collection of traditional pop music standards, Martin's first such album in this vein since 1964's Dream with Dean. The release of The Dean Martin TV Show and The Dean Martin Christmas Album in late 1966 was accompanied by what Billboard magazine described as a \\"merchandising avalanche\\" by Reprise Records and their parent company Warner Music. Billboard described Martin as running the \\"hottest streak of his career,\\" and said that Reprise planned to sell $4 million of his records over the Christmas sales period. Reception The initial Billboard review from November 26, 1966 commented that \\"The material is some of the best in the standard category...backed by exceptional Ernie Freeman arrangements and the Les Brown Orchestra, Martin is in top vocal form\\". William Ruhlmann on Allmusic.com gave the album three stars out of five. Noting that Martin's recent recordings had been a \\"lengthy series of country-pop hits that borrowed from the Nashville sound\\", Ruhlmann commented that Martin's album of traditional pop standards must have come as a \\"considerable relief\\" for his most \\"faithful fans\\".

Self-portrait, 1901 The Thiel Gallery Riddarfj√§rden in Stockholm, 1898, Nationalmuseum (cropped image) Eug√®ne Fredrik Jansson (18 March 1862, Stockholm ‚Äì 15 June 1915, Skara) was a Swedish painter known for his night-time land- and cityscapes dominated by shades of blue. Towards the end of his life, from about 1904, he mainly painted male nudes. The earlier of these phases has caused him to sometimes be referred to as bl√•m√•laren, \\"the blue-painter\\". Life Jansson's parents belonged to a social stratum straddling the working and the lower middle class, but they were interested in art and music and ambitious for their two sons, Eug√®ne and his younger brother Adrian. Eug√®ne went to the German School in Stockholm and took piano lessons. An attack of scarlet fever at the age of fourteen caused him health issues from which he suffered for the rest of his life, including bad eyesight and hearing and chronic kidney problems. Sunrise over the rooftops, 1903 (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm (image is cropped) Jansson enrolled in the Tekniska skolan (now Konstfack) and studied with Edvard Pers√©us, a painter who ran a private art school in Stockholm. He was accepted into the Antique school of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1881, but did not have the means to follow most of his contemporaries to Paris for further studies. Remaining in Stockholm, which supplied him most of his motifs, his first trip outside the Nordic countries would come in 1900, when he had already become well- established as a painter and his economic situation had started to improve. In his youth, he assisted Pers√©us in his portrait production and painted some still lifes, but he eventually found his favourite motifs in the city surrounding him. He lived his whole life together with his mother and brother at S√∂dermalm, the southern part of Stockholm. They eventually settled in a flat at No. 40 Bastugatan, on a height with a view over most of central Stockholm including the Riddarfj√§rden bay and the Old town. Most of his paintings from the 1890s up to 1904 are night views over Riddarfj√§rden, as he would have seen it from his home, or street views from various parts of S√∂dermalm. They are dominated by shades of blue and very visible brush strokes, often crossing one another. Over the years his paintings moved towards increasing simplification and abstraction, and at the end of his \\"blue\\" period, little more than the street lights and their reflections in the waters can be discerned from the mass of blue of the canvas. Pushing Weights with Two Arms, II, 1913‚Äì14 (in a private collection) After 1904, when he had already achieved success with his Stockholm views, Jansson confessed to a friend that he felt absolutely exhausted and had no more wish to continue with what he had done until then. He stopped participating in exhibitions for several years and went over to figure painting. To combat the health issues he had suffered from since childhood, he became a diligent swimmer and winter bather, often visiting the navy bathhouse, where he found the new subjects for his paintings. He painted groups of sunbathing sailors, and young muscular nude men lifting weights or doing other physical exercises. Art historians and critics have long avoided the issue of any possible homoerotic tendencies in this later phase of his art, but later studies (see Brummer 1999) have established that Jansson was in all probability homosexual and appears to have had a relationship with at least one of his models. His brother, Adrian Jansson, who was himself homosexual and survived Eug√®ne by many years, burnt all his letters and many other papers, possibly to avoid scandal (homosexuality was illegal in Sweden until 1944).Brummer, Hans Henrik: \\"Bl√• skymning och atleter.

The play was one of those produced by the world- famous Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) in its first season.Benedetti (1999, 386) and Worrall (1996, 104-105). This production opened in a double-bill with Greta's Happiness by Emilia Matthai on 2 December 1898. It was directed by Constantin Stanislavski, who also played the misogynist Ripafratta.Benedetti (1999, 386) and Worrall (1996, 106). Stanislavski directed the play in a second production at the MAT, which opened on 3 February 1914 after 112 rehearsals.Benedetti (1999, 218, 387). He played the role of Ripafratta once more.Benedetti (1999, 387). The artist Alexandre Benois provided the scenic design for this production, which was conceived as a showcase for the actress Olga Gzovskaya.Benedetti (1999, 217). Adaptations In 1773 the Venetian composer Antonio Salieri and the librettist Domenico Poggi adapted the play as a three- act dramma giocoso.Rice (1992). In 1800 the German composer Simon Mayr and Italian librettist Gaetano Rossi adapted it as a two-act dramma giocoso.Balthazar (1992). The American composer Henry Kimball Hadley adapted it as a one-act comic opera called Bianca, which was first performed in 1918.Boardman (1932, 131-132). Bohuslav Martin≈Ø also produced an operatic version, his three-act Mirandolina, which was first performed in 1959.

The automotive industry in Turkey plays an important role in the manufacturing sector of the Turkish economy. The companies operating in the Turkish automotive sector are mainly located in the Marmara Region. In 2015 Turkey produced over 1.3 million motor vehicles, ranking as the 14th largest producer in the world. With a cluster of car- makers and parts suppliers, the Turkish automotive sector has become an integral part of the global network of production bases, exporting nearly $20 billion worth of motor vehicles and components. In 2017 nearly 85% of exports went to Europe. Global car manufacturers with production plants include Fiat/Tofa≈ü, Oyak-Renault, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda and Ford/Otosan. The foundations of the industry were laid in the 1950s when TOE (T√ºrk Otomotiv End√ºstrileri A.≈ü.) started producing REO military truck and later trucks by International Harvester. A brief foray in car production was stopped short. In 1961 the first domestic car Devrim was made by a train manufacturer T√úLOMSA≈û. With the establishment of the Otosan assembly factory in 1959, mass production of the domestic car Anadol started in 1966. History Last sample of Devrim at T√úLOMSA≈û Anadol A1 (manufactured at Ford Otosan) Tofa≈ü Murat 124 Oyak- Renault 12 Anadol STC-16 (manufactured at Ford Otosan) Karsan Peugeot J9 Etox Zafer Coup√© near G√∂ksu Park in the Eryaman district of Ankara In 1929 the first car was assembled in Istanbul by Ford Motor Company. 48 cars were produced daily. However, production ended due to the Great Depression of the 1930s. In 1954 the Jeep factory was established for the production of Turkey's Willys-Overland vehicles in Tuzla, Turkey. In 1959 the Otosan factory was established in Istanbul to produce the models of the Ford Motor Company under licence in Turkey. Production of the Ford Consul at the Otosan factory began in 1960. In 1961 the Devrim sedan was manufactured at the T√ºlomsa≈ü factory in Eski≈üehir. It was the first indigenously designed and produced Turkish automobile. In 1964 the production of the Austin and Morris vehicles of the British Motor Corporation began at the BMC factory in ƒ∞zmir. The BMC brand was later fully acquired by Turkey's √áukurova Group in 1989, which currently produces all BMC models in the world. In 1966 Anadol became the first mass- produced Turkish automobile brand. All Anadol models were produced by the Otosan factory in Istanbul. In 1968 the Tofa≈ü factory was opened in Bursa for producing Fiat models under licence. In 1969 the Oyak-Renault factory was established in Bursa for producing Renault models. Other global automotive manufacturers such as Toyota, Honda, Opel, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and MAN Truck & Bus produce automobiles, vans, buses and trucks in their Turkish factories. There are also a number of Turkish bus and truck brands, such as BMC, Otokar and TEMSA. By 2004, Turkey was exporting 518,000 vehicles a year, mostly to the European Union member states. In 2006, the European Investment Bank loaned Tofa≈ü ‚Ç¨175 million to jointly develop and produce with PSA Peugeot Citro√´n and Fiat Auto small commercial vehicles for the European market. The loan, part-financing for total investments estimated at ‚Ç¨400 million, was intended to result in an important expansion of the company's production capabilities and create around 5,000 new jobs. The vehicles will be produced at the manufacturing plant of Tofa≈ü in Bursa with an additional, initial, annual capacity of 135.000 cars, due to roll off the assembly line in late 2007. The first official introduction of Etox Zafer took place on 30 August 2007. Like in many countries, the car manufacturing industry has been significantly affected by the global financial crisis. In March 2009, Turkey's Automotive Industry Association (OSD) said the automotive production fell by 63% on year in the first two months of 2009, as exports dropped by 61.6% in the same period. In 2019, the high automotive export figures were boosted by the substantial increase in sales to the Netherlands and the U.S., which saw a rise of 131% and 55%, respectively.

Domestic Turkish car Existing diesel vehicles cause air pollution in Turkey. On November 2, 2017, Turkey announced that five Turkish companies, under coordination by the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey, decided to take part in the consortium for domestically-made EV production, which was established in 2018 with the name TOGG. The first prototypes, designed by Pininfarina, were presented to the media in 2019 and commercial sales are scheduled to begin by 2022. The electric cars will be produced in five models (C-segment hatchback, C-segment sedan, C-segment MPV, C-segment SUV and B-segment SUV) and the initial production rate will be 175,000 vehicles per annum. Production may not be enough to avoid the risk to the economy of Turkey of high oil import bills in the mid-2020s.

History With its founding in 1912 and much of its early development tracing to the early 20th Century, what is present-day Alberta City was annexed into Tuscaloosa on September 21, 1948. On April 27, 2011, Alberta City suffered the heaviest damage from a tornado that destroyed 12% of greater Tuscaloosa, including residences, churches, and stores. The suburb's landscape was changed significantly as numerous properties, homes, and businesses were completely destroyed and left as flat vacant lots after demolitions. Two police stations, a postal office, and elementary, middle, and primary day care schools were all damaged beyond repair or destroyed. Alberta City has undergone slow, gradual reconstruction ever since, largely due to revitalization efforts from the Tuscaloosa city government and from private investors and businesses seeing potential in the area due to its close proximity to the University of Alabama's main campus.

Saltivka or the Saltivka Masyv (; ) is a large residential area located in the northeastern region of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine. It occupies a substantial portion of Moskovskyi District and part of Kyivskyi District and Nemyshlyanskyi Districts. It is sometimes referred to as Saltivka Masyv, as it unites several different neighborhoods which contain similar residential areas. The name of the neighborhood is derived from the road that leads to Staryi Saltiv and Verkhniy Saltiv in Vovchansk Raion. Saltivka is bounded by the flood plain north of the Kharkiv River along the east regional road to sovkhoz Ukrainka and Kulynychi village, the River Nemyshlya in the south, Marshal Batytsky and Yakir streets to the west, and the market at Kharkiv Metro station Akademika Barabashova. The county is so named because of the road that runs from the centre of the city of Kharkiv, the Old Saltiv - Saltiv highway. Prior to the 1960s, Saltivka was called Saltivsky village, and consisted of a few small scattered areas with three-story buildings (Tyurinka, Stara Saltivka, Shevchenky, Selyshche Imeni Kirova). Despite its reputation as a deprived residential area with outdated and dilapidated housing, more than a third of Kharkiv's total population resides within its boundaries. Saltivka was conceived from the start as a purely residential neighborhood according to the Soviet concept of creating so-called sleeping districts in large industrial cities. According to various estimates, some 400-800,000 inhabitants live in Saltivka, making it one of the largest residential areas in Ukraine. Saltivka has almost no industrial compounds, but there are many shops and markets for residents. The neighborhood includes one of the largest warehouse markets in Ukraine near the subway station named after Academician Barabashov. The Barabashov marketplace, according to some sources, is the largest in Europe. Residential development was initiated by the Institute Hiprobud in 1963. Saltivka's panel residential buildings typically have 9, 12 and 16 floors, and more rarely, 5 floors. Separate high-rise buildings were constructed from 1967, and construction on the bulk of the buildings in Saltivka began in the 1970s.

The premise, conceived by Steven Nalevansky, involves a creature lurking beneath the sand of Santa Monica Beach that attacks locals and vacationers. The film's tagline is: \\"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...you can't get to it.\\" Plot In the opening scene, a woman named Ruth is walking her dog on Los Angeles, California's Venice Beach, and is suddenly pulled under the sand of the deserted beach by an unseen force. The woman's screams for help are heard by Harry Caulder, a harbor patrol officer who is swimming nearby. Harry reports Ruth's disappearance to two LAPD detectives, Royko and Piantadosi, who claim that without a body, there is little they can do. The next day, Ruth's estranged daughter, Catherine, arrives from San Francisco after Harry calls her regarding her mother's disappearance. Meanwhile, the mysterious and crazed Mrs. Selden, who resides in an abandoned section of the Santa Monica Amusement Pier, witnesses the attack and disappearance (and others throughout the film), but does not come forward. That night, while staying in Ruth's house, Catherine hears Ruth's dog barking on the beach near the location where Ruth disappeared. Catherine investigates and finds the dog beheaded, near a small sinkhole. Royko and Piantadosi, as well as Harry, are called to the scene, but police pathologist Dr. Dimitrious cannot accurately determine a cause of death for the dog. Royko and Piantadosi believe it to be the work of a serial killer, due to reports of other disappearances over the past few months. The next morning, a teenage girl is buried in the sand at the beach and begins screaming. Her friends pull her out of the sand, only to see that her legs have been injured from an attack by an unseen creature. The police, led by Captain Pearson, begin an investigation by digging up various sections of the beach at night, but find nothing. The next morning, people visit the beach, which the local media have dubbed \\"Blood Beach\\". The following night, Harry's co-worker Hoagy is closing up the harbor patrol office for the night when his girlfriend ventures under the pier to investigate a noise and is assaulted by a man. After being knocked to the ground by the girl, the would-be-rapist is attacked by the unseen creature, which castrates him. An evening or two later, Marie, a French airline stewardess who is living with Harry, chases after her hat when it is blown by wind onto the beach. She, too, is grabbed by the unseen creature and pulled under the sand. The next morning, Harry sees Marie's hat on the beach, along with a small sinkhole which he recognizes as similar to the hole at the scene of Ruth's disappearance and the death of the dog. Harry calls the police, who dig up the area around the sinkhole and find Marie's disembodied eyeball. Searching for the unknown creature's home, Harry ventures to an abandoned section of the pier and finds an access tunnel leading to an underground storage facility. After finding nothing, he leaves the tunnel, not noticing a movement in a collapsed section of the wall. Harry and Catherine go out to a nightclub, where they try to rekindle their romance. Meanwhile, a man with a metal detector is walking under the pier looking for metal objects when he is attacked and pulled under the sand by the still-unseen creature. The man's wife, Mrs. Hench, reports him missing. The next day, Royko and Piantadosi find Mr. Hench emerging from a sewer manhole in a Venice street after escaping from the creature's lair, but he is in a state of shock after being horribly mangled and cannot explain what happened to him. Hoagy is the next victim, after he visits the pier to try to persuade Mrs. Selden to leave the area. He, too, is pulled under the sand by the underground creature while she watches stoically. Having been told by Harry about the access tunnel, Catherine visits the storage facility under the pier to look around just as Harry brings Piantadosi with him to investigate. They find all 16 of the creature's partially-eaten victims, including Ruth's severed head, parts of Marie's body and Hoagy's fresh corpse. Captain Pearson arrives with the police, who remove all of the bodies. Pearson orders the officers to use a backhoe and equipment to track the monster down. Increased attention from the local news media lead the police to attempt to kill the creature as quickly as possible and Pearson orders the installation of motion detectors, heat-sensing cameras and explosives. That evening, the huge creature emerges from the sand and is caught on camera; it resembles a worm-like Venus flytrap. Without hesitation, Royko activates the detonator and the creature is blown to pieces. Dr. Dimitrios points out that they still do not know anything about the monster's origins or abilities. Since it resembled a giant worm, and some worms have the capability to regenerate, Dimitrios wonders what will happen to \\"each piece\\". The next morning, Harry leaves with Catherine to drive her home to San Francisco while the beach reopens to the public, now that the subterranean creature is dead. In the final scene over the end credits, as the beach becomes crowded again, new small sinkholes begin to appear unnoticed all over the sand, implying that Dr. Dimitrios was correct in his theory that the creature has the ability to regenerate from its severed pieces.

The film was released in the U.S. on VHS by Media Home Entertainment. As of 2012, the film had only been officially released on DVD in Germany. Alamo Drafthouse Cinema re- released the film in a limited 35mm screening on March 14, 2015 as part of the \\"NY!

Reception  On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 0% based on 7 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 2.6/10. Tom Buckley's review in The New York Times called it \\"a cut or two above the recent run of low-budget horror films\\" and praised the work of \\"an attractive and professional cast, a rarity in the genre\\", but noted that it was \\"undermined by plodding direction and a talky and incoherent script that is short on action, suspense and even the gore that the title promises\\". Buckley also criticized the cinematography, which he called \\"oddly blurry, as though someone had coated the lens with vaseline\\". AllMovie's review noted: \\"The potential for campy fun in this premise is defeated by a completely straight, plodding detective story\\". Scott Weinberg of eFilmCritic.com also gave the film a negative review, writing, \\"Gore-less and bizarre, it's a tough one to track down. If you do search this one out, you should probably be out looking for a job\\". TV Guide awarded the film 1 out of 4 stars, noting: \\"Unfortunately, the film never rises to the level of its advertising.\\" See also * Sand Sharks (2011), another horror B movie about monster sharks lurking in the sand * Tremors (1990), American western monster film about giant worm-like creatures living underground * The Sand (2015), a horror movie about a creature that lives under the sand of a beach.

The owner receives a gold trophy while the trainer, the jockey and the breeder win a silver half size replica of the main gold trophy. The trophy itself has been run for since the 50th running of the Kentucky Derby in 1924. Churchill Downs Race Course of Louisville, Kentucky has annually presented a gold trophy to the winning owner of the famed \\"Run for the Roses.\\" \\"Kentucky Derby Trophy\\" Early history There is no record whether a trophy was presented to the winner of the first Derby in 1875. There is evidence that trophy presentations were sporadically made between 1876 and 1924. In 1924, Matt Winn, who was the president of Churchill Downs at the time commissioned a standard design from artist George L. Graff for the 1925 50th \\"Golden Anniversary\\" of the Derby.Encyclopedia of Louisville, p.507 Design changes over time Outside of the jeweled embellishments that were added to note special Derby anniversaries in 1949 (75th), 1974 (100th), and 1999 (125th), only one change has been made to the original design. For the 125th Kentucky Derby in 1999, Churchill Downs officials decided to defer to racing lore and change the direction of the decorative horseshoe. The horseshoe, fashioned from 18-karat gold, had pointed downward on each of the trophies since 1924. To commemorate Derby 125 the change was made and the horseshoe was turned 180 degrees so that its ends pointed up. The trophy now annually incorporates the horseshoe with the ends pointing up. Racing superstition decrees that if the horseshoe is turned down all the luck will run out.The Kentucky Derby Media Guide, Kentucky Derby 135, May 2, 2009, page 56, Winning Owners 1875-2008 Dimensions and manufacture The trophy was supplied by Lemon & Son, a Louisville jeweller (and the oldest retail business in Louisville) from 1924 until 1999. From 1975 onwards, the trophy has been manufactured by the New England Sterling company, located in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. The trophy, which is topped by an 18-karat gold horse and rider, includes horseshoe shaped handles, is 22 inches tall and weighs 56 ounces, excluding its jade base. Most of it is 14-karat gold; some components are 14-karat green gold. To complete the trophy by April, construction begins during the fall of the previous year; the completed trophy takes approximately 2000 hours of labor. Typically 29 parts are combined into 19 components which comprise the trophy. Various construction techniques are used, including casting (the horse and rider that top the trophy), stamping and metal spinning.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/62187/derby-winners- trophy-arrives-at-churchill The trophy is believed to be the only solid gold trophy that is annually awarded the winner of a major American sporting event. As of 2008, its material raw value was $90,000.The Kentucky Derby Media Guide, Kentucky Derby 135, May 2, 2009, page 236, 2008 Kentucky Derby chart Presentations of trophy Each year there are three separate presentations of the trophy. The first presentation of the gold Kentucky Derby Trophy is when it is officially presented to Churchill Downs race course on the last Saturday of April escorted by the Kentucky Army National Guard soldiers in between races on the undercard of the Derby Trial Stakes on opening day of the spring meet each year. The second presentation is the one that is most familiar to the public on the first Saturday of May. It is when the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the Chairman of Churchill Downs Incorporated awards the trophies to the winning connections about ten minutes after the race is declared official on NBC network TV. The third and final presentation of the trophies is on \\"Alumni Day\\" on the Saturday of June following the Belmont Stakes, exactly six weeks after the race. The winning owner, trainer, jockey and breeder are all invited back to receive the trophies they earned earlier but have since been engraved with precise information engraved on each award. Churchill celebrates its third largest draw at the gate when the trophies are presented on \\"Stephen Foster\\" day. That day includes two opportunities for the public to meet winning alumni of the Kentucky Derby. The first has many former winning jockeys hold an autograph session. The second has the winning connections participating in a news conference and trophy presentation in between races on the undercard of the Stephen Foster Handicap, which is a grade one race for older horses at the Derby distance of one mile and a quarter. \\"Run for the Roses\\" The use of roses was first established as part of the Derby celebration when they were presented to all the ladies attending a fashionable Louisville Derby party in 1883. The roses were such a sensation, that the president of Churchill Downs, Colonel Lewis Clark, adopted the rose as the race's official flower. The rose garland now synonymous with the Kentucky Derby first appeared in the 1896 when the winner, Ben Brush, received a floral arrangement of white and pink roses. The official \\"Garland of Roses\\" is presented in the winner's circle after the race In 1904 the red rose became the official flower of the Kentucky Derby. The tradition was strengthened when, in 1925, New York sports columnist Bill Corum, later the president of Churchill Downs, dubbed the Kentucky Derby the \\"Run for the Roses.\\" The garland as it exists today was first introduced in 1932 for the 58th running won by Burgoo King. Composition and construction of Garland Each year, a garland of more than 400 red roses is sewn into a green satin backing with the seal of the Commonwealth on one end and the Churchill Downs twin spires and number of the running on the other. Each garland is also adorned with a \\"Crown\\" of roses, green fern and ribbon. The \\"Crown,\\" a single rose pointing upward in the center of the garland, symbolizes the struggle and heart necessary to reach the winners' circle. Each year the Governor and other dignitaries present the winning jockey with a bouquet of 60 long stemmed roses wrapped in ten yards of ribbon. For several years, owners of the Derby winner also received a silk replica of the garland, but since Grindstone's 1996 victory, the actual garland has made the trip to Danville, Kentucky to be freeze-dried. Some owners have even gone as far as to have a flower dipped in silver. A silver dipped flower from the garland of Gato del Sol, the 1982 winner, is on display in the Kentucky Derby Museum. The Kroger Company has been the official florist of the Kentucky Derby since 1987. After taking over the duties from the Kingsley Walker florist, Kroger began constructing the prestigious garland in one of its local stores for the public to view on Derby Eve. The preservation of the garland and crowds of spectators watching its construction are a testament to the prestige and mystique of the Garland of Roses.

The mission of the NDSS is to be the leading human rights organization for all individuals with Down syndrome. History The NDSS was founded by Betsy Goodwin and Arden Moulton. Goodwin's daughter Carson was born in 1978 with Down Syndrome. The parents soon discovered that the support and resources available to parents with Down syndrome children were very limited. Goodwin and Arden decided to create the NDSS, which gained official nonprofit status in 1979. Areas of programming NDSS focuses on four items of programming to enhance the quality of life for those with Down syndrome. * The National Policy Center creates systematic change through legislative policy.https://ardownsyndrome.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NDSS-Brochure.pdf * The National Buddy Walk Program honors and celebrates individuals with Down syndrome in their communities. * The Public Awareness Initiatives bring new and positive presentations of Down syndrome to the public. * The Community Programs provide information and resources about Down syndrome.  Other initiatives  In January 2019, it was reported in Skeptical Inquirer that the NDSS had just offered a free public webinar on facilitated communication. This is reportedly a thoroughly discredited communication method based on the theory that many people that are unable to speak are not cognitively impaired, but are simply suffering from an inability to produce the sounds for speech. A helper or ‚Äúfacilitator‚Äù assists by guiding the non-speaking person's hand over a keyboard. However, empirical tests have revealed that the facilitator is actually the one doing the typing, and not the person with the disability. Stuart Vyse, reporting for Skeptical Inquirer, commented that ‚Äúit is unfortunate that a leading Down syndrome advocacy group is promoting a belief system over evidence-based methods that work.‚Äù ReferencesExternal links *National Buddy Walk¬Æ Program * Down syndrome Disability organizations based in the United States Non- profit organizations based in New York City Organizations based in Manhattan Organizations established in 1979 1979 establishments in the United States ","title":"National Down Syndrome Society"},{"id":"23842447","text":"Capitol University is a non-sectarian, co-educational private university located in Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines.

It is one of the major watercourses of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The name is of Guarani origin, a corruption of aq√ª√¢-√°ra-i, meaning \\"enduring current\\". It is not related to the Loricariidae Acari fish. Course The Acari River rises in the Serra do Gericin√≥ with its mouth on the Rio Meriti which separates the city of Rio from Duque de Caxias. The Acari flows through the city from the extreme west to the zona norte. It is navigable but as it traverses the territories of three separate criminal gangs it has ceased to be used as a waterway. Ecology The river is not silted up and has a very large flow of water with riparian vegetation in some areas. It was one of the last of the rivers of Rio to suffer from macrobiological death. Alligators can still be found in the river, but there are no longer any freshwater shrimp present. There is a popular wish for the river to be cleaned up and to become a major source of local income by offering recreation, fishing and transportation.

It emerges from two springs on the southeast slopes of the Tijuca Massif in the protected Mata Atlantica forest of Tijuca National Park. The river then leaves Tijuca Forest into the Guararapes favela, then into the high-income Cosme Velho neighborhood, and then it is buried completely underground. The river reemerges in Flamengo Park to empty into Guanabara Bay at Flamengo Beach. Research by the Funda√ß√£o SOS Mata Atl√¢ntica in 2015 confirmed that every river in the City of Rio de Janeiro is polluted, including the Carioca River. The river, once the primary source of fresh water in the city, is now one of its most polluted. Untreated sewage is the primary source of pollution of the Carioca; the stretch of the river in Guararapes and Cosme Velho are a great sources of unregulated sewage. The water of the Carioca carries pollutants that cause diarrhea, hepatitis, and leptospirosis. The river has a single wastewater treatment facility near its mouth before emptying into Guanabara Bay. It was installed by the State of Rio de Janeiro in 2001. Biochemical evaluation of the river began in 1991 and water quality decreases annually.

In 1853, Captain Alden Partridge opened the National Scientific and Military Academy at Brandywine Springs. The school building was destroyed by fire shortly after opening and the school closed. In the 1880s, it became known for its mineral springs and luxurious hotel resort In the early twentieth century, it became renowned for an amusement park built along the Hyde Run tributary. The amusement park closed down following the 1923 season. The Friends of Brandywine Springs are dedicated to recovering the history of the amusement park. Early films of the park from circa 1903 are some of the earliest motion picture images of Delaware. In 1956 state senator Fredrick Klair procured the land for the state and established Brandywine Springs State Park. In 1970, Brandywine Springs was converted from a state park to a county park operated by New Castle County as the legislature felt it better met local needs as opposed to state needs, and there had been no county-level parks department at the time it was created as a state park.

Animator and entrepreneur Walt Disney cited the second Kansas City Electric Park as his primary inspiration for the design of the first modern theme park, Disneyland. First park The Heim brothers built the first Electric Park in land adjacent to the Heim Brothers Brewery (at the time the largest brewery in the world) in East Bottoms. The amusement park was bounded by Montgall, Chestnut, Nicholson, and Rochester Avenues. Open from 1899 to 1906, the first Electric Park proved to be an immediate success as one of the world's first full-time amusement parks. Featuring a Shoot-the-Chutes ride (called the Mystic Chute),Postcard photo of the Mystic Chute, first Kansas City Electric Park, 1906 the park also had a beer garden with beer piped directly from the brewery next door.Monroe Dodd, Kansas City: Then & Now 2 (Kansas City Star Books 2003) Eventually, the carefully groomed grounds were too small to sustain the park's popularity; at the end of the 1906 season, some of the rides were dismantled and moved to a new location to the south. Much of the grounds lay neglected or abandoned for the next 19 years. in 1925, part of the plot (near the corner of Montgall and Rochester) was deeded to city of Kansas City for use as a neighborhood playground. Opened in a 1 August 1925 ceremony,One month before the close of the second Kansas City Electric Park the park offered \\"Pet Night\\", in which children won prizes for displaying the largest, smallest, and the most deformed dog. Another day saw swimsuits awarded to boys who created wood carvings from dead trees.The Illustrated History of Fairmount Park - Kansas City: Jackson County Historical Society Second park The second Kansas City Electric Park, this time at 46th Street and the Paseo, opened 19 May 1907. Like the first one, it was a trolley park (this time served by the Troost Avenue, Woodland Avenue, and Rockhill lines of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company),\\"Prospect Line to 37th St.: Extension Will Not Take It to the Swope Park Connection\\", Kansas City Journal, 5 January 1907 but the successor was one of the largest (if not the largest) ever to be called Electric Park. It had \\"band concerts, vaudeville, Electric Fountain, ballroom, natatorium, German village, alligator farm, chutes, Dips Coaster, Norton slide, penny parlors, novelty stand, Japanese rolling ball, scenic railway, pool room, a Hale's Tour of the World, Electric Studio, boat tours, old mill, a Temple of Mirth, Flying Lady, Double Whirl, Circle Swing, soda fountain and ice cream shops, knife rack, doll rack, shooting gallery, air gun gallery, giant teeter, boating, outdoor swimming, carousel, clubhouse cafe, Casino 5 cent theater, fortune telling and palmistry, covered promenade and horseless buggy garage.\\"1907: The Illustrated History of Fairmount Park Souvenirs from the park touted it as \\"Kansas City's Coney Island,\\"Cultural Kansas City: Fads, Feats, & Trivial Pursuits - University of Missouri - Kansas City Library which it matched by having 100,000 light bulbs adorn its buildings.Brian Burnes, Dan Viets, and Robert W. Butler, Walt Disney's Missouri: The Roots of a Creative Genius (Kansas City Star Books, 2002) In 1911, the second Kansas City park attracted one million people,Monroe Dodd and Daniel Serda, The Kansas City Story for Kids (Kansas City Star Books 2000) averaging 8000 paying customers per day that season.Brian Burnes, Dan Viets, and Robert W. Butler, Walt Disney's Missouri: The Roots of a Creative Genius (Kansas City Star Books 2002) Much of the second Electric Park in Kansas City burned to the ground in 1925. The fire was witnessed by a young Walter Cronkite, who later wroteWalter Cronkite, A Reporter's Life (A.A. Knopf 1996) Rick Montgomery, Shirl Kasper, Jean Dodd, and Arthur S. Brisbane, Kansas City: an American Story (Kansas City Star Books 1999) Despite the devastating blaze, the park maintained its operating hours as its theater and its aquarium remained open for the remainder of its last year. In the final days of 1925, Electric Park inaugurated its Coin Carnival to replace its destroyed midway. The two weeks before its final closing, Electric Park celebrated its own Mardi Gras after the Heim family decided to sell the land. On 1 September 1925, a fireworks exhibition punctuated the park's last closing ceremony. Walt Disney and the Kansas City Electric Park After Elias Disney moved his family to Kansas City in 1911, a nine-year-old Walt and his younger sister Ruth became regular visitors to the second Electric Park, which was a mere 15 blocks from their new home at 3028 Bellefontaine Street. While the Kansas City park was inspired by the original White City in the 1893 Columbian Exposition (for which Elias was a construction worker), Walt later took many features of the Kansas City Electric Park (including a train whose track ringed the park grounds and the daily fireworks at closing time) and incorporated them into Disneyland when he started developing the plans for the layout of the park that he opened in 1955.Pat Williams and Jim Denney, How to Be Like Walt: Capturing the Disney Magic Every Day of Your Life (HCI 2004) Unlike many of its contemporaries, the Electric Park's grounds were meticulously maintained with landscaping designed to accentuate the park's rides and other attractions, a trait that Disney insisted to be maintained in Disneyland. Electric Park's \\"Living Statuary\\"'s electric procession featured young women emerging from a fountain onto a platform while bathed in various colored lights. Disney's entrances featured structures similar in design and structure to that of Electric Park's Monkey Cage Gazebo. In fact, most of the attractions that graced Disney's childhood park had similar counterparts in the California park that he opened three decades later.  In popular culture  Electric Park is described in Time Enough For Love by Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Lazarus Long (as Sergeant Theodore Bronson) takes his mother and her son Woodie to the Kansas City park during the spring or summer of 1918. The reference is in Da Capo VII.

Founded by Arthur Frothingham in 1886 as a picnic park, it was transformed into an amusement park by engineer and entrepreneur Frederick Ingersoll in 1904. The trolley park was a popular Pennsylvania attraction that featured rides, arcades, and restaurants ‚Äì even as a \\"wild west\\" theme park in the 1970s ‚Äì until its closure in 1987.  History  Land developer Arthur Frothingham purchased the site for $15 at a tax sale in 1885.Jack Hiddlestone, Scranton Luna Park (Penn Creative Litho 1991), as cited in Rocky Glen (circa 1904‚Äì1987) The following year, Rocky Glenn was open to the public as a picnic park. About 1900, Frothingham contracted E. S. Williams to dam Dry Valley Run Creek to create a lake on the property; when Frothingham failed to pay Williams for the work, Williams sued and was awarded one-half interest in the park.The Scranton Times, 25 July 1982, as cited in Rocky Glen (circa 1904‚Äì1987)Rocky Glen: Early Years (1885 - 1902) Soon afterward, Frothingham obtained a Pennsylvania state cemetery charter for the park after learning of plans of extending tracks of the Lehigh Valley Railroad over the grounds. To avoid losing the park via eminent domain, Frothingham interred two bodies (one of a man who died in a mining accident, one of a man who died in a train accident) in the proposed route of the track; the Lehigh Valley Railway purchased a parcel of the cemetery for $25,000 and agreed to build a Laurel Line station nearby.Rocky Glen Park Pennsylvania State historical marker, as shown on Laurellines.org commemoration pageRocky Glen: Laurel Line Connection (1902 - 1903) In 1904, Frederick Ingersoll added amusement park rides and concessions, and the newly rechristened Rocky Glen Park, named after the newly-formed Rocky Glen Water Company, became a local sensation.West Pittston history The following year saw the debut of Ingersoll's signature figure eight roller coaster as the Pittsburgh engineer started diverting his energies to his soon-to-open Luna Parks in Pittsburgh and Cleveland (his Luna Park in nearby Scranton was to open the following year). A rift between park owner Frothingham and park manager Ingersoll led to the parting of their ways in 1906. Interest in the park waned in the 1910s, and Frothingham wished to sell his half of the property. After failed attempts to sell the park to MGM and Federal Feature Film Corporation of New York,James N. J. Henwood and John G. Muncie, Laurel Line: An Anthracite Region Railway (Tribute Books 2005) Williams and Frothingham sold it to a trio of businessmen (John Nallin, Joe Jennings, and Ben Sterling) in 1919. Go west, young man, to relive park's era - Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, 1 August 2009 After a tumultuous period in which the three partners disagreed about park management (at one point, Rocky Glen Park was divided in two by a fence), Sterling ultimately gained complete control in 1950Park listing in Roller Coaster data base and renamed the park Sterling's Rocky Glen, the name he used for his half of the park when it was divided (eventually the name was shortened to Sterling's). By 1945, Rocky Glen Park's popularity was on the upswing when Sterling added the Million Dollar Coaster, a 96-foot-tall, 4700-foot-long, out-and-back roller coaster that became the park's new signature attraction. Despite its name, the ride cost Sterling only $100,000 to build.Robert Cartmell, The Incredible Scream Machine: A History of the Roller Coaster (Popular Press 1987) Shoehorned between Glen Lake and the tracks of the Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad, it was one of the world's largest roller coasters at the time. It carried more than one million passengers in the first three years of its existence (it was dismantled in 1957).Electric City Renaissance - Rocky Glen Park page The post-World War II increase in the use of the automobile contributed to the gradual decline in the use of the railroad, and the few remaining trolley parks were slowly fading into the sunset. Sterling's/Rocky Glen was no exception (its plight exacerbated by the decline in the coal industry at the same time),Jim Futrell, Amusement Parks of Pennsylvania (Stackpole Books 2002) and by 1970, Ben Sterling opted to sell the park to an Atlanta, Georgia-based entertainment company, National Recreation Service. The new owners promptly converted the grounds into a theme park, renaming it Ghost Town in the Glen (later Ghost Town Amusement Park) and gave it a western theme. The rebranding was not successful: the park changed hands once again in 1979 and became New Rocky Glen. The lake became a venue for concerts starting in 1980. The park closed for the last time in 1987. Roller Coaster History Rocky Glen was home to several large roller coasters in its history: *Figure 8 roller coaster (1904‚Äì1913) - Was built by Frederick Ingersoll in 1904 and opened August 6. Owned by A.E. Todd, Ace Todd and Robert McCurtrie in 1913. Removed when Ingersoll's original 10 year lease expired in 1913. *Mountain Dips Coaster (August 5, 1920 ‚Äì December 1939) - Designed by John A. Miller and construction supervised by Herbert Schmeck, it was built in early 1920 by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company (Coaster #33) for $70,000 after Rocky Glen re-opened in the 1919 season under new ownership (Rocky Glen had been without rides from 1914-1919 since the original 10 year lease with Ingersoll expired in 1913 and had been in a state of flux). This coaster was built in front of the dam which also crossed over the Laurel Line railroad tracks and was considered the largest on the eastern seaboard in its early years. The coaster was removed by December of 1939 as the new Rocket ride was placed where the entrance to the coaster was for the 1940 season. Newspaper reports say Ben Sterling had torn down the coaster by December of 1939 without any warning. A death that occurred on the Coaster in September of 1939 may have revealed safety concerns that Ben Sterling did not feel would be worth the cost or correcting, and merely elected to remove the ride instead. It was unique in that the lift hill was actually halfway through the ride, instead of at the beginning. The lift hill was structurally connected to the Laurel Line station's entrance overpass in its earlier design, but later was removed. This coaster has been incorrectly referred to as the \\"Giant Coaster\\" due to generic advertisements of the time period, and is also confused in history with the Pippin Coaster as some have merged both coaster's histories together. The Jack Rabbit at Kennywood Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has a similar design. *Pippin Coaster (May 24, 1924 ‚Äì May 24, 1950) - was a part of the Nallin-Jennings Park Company and was built in 1924 for $70,000 by John A. Miller as the John A. Miller Company. This coaster was the main attraction of the Nallin-Jennings side of Rocky Glen. On May 24, 1950, a fire destroyed Ben Sterling's Penny Arcade, Nallin-Jennings's 3 major attractions: The massive Fun House (which was the rebuilt Crystal Dance Pavilion), Tokio Canal (an Old Mill type ride) and the front half of the Pippin Coaster. This fire, probably the most damaging of all fires in the park's history, all but ended the Nallin-Jennings side of Rocky Glen as they eventually sold the land and what was left to Benjamin & Lena Balka in December of 1950, who then in turn immediately sold it to Ben & Mae Sterling in January 1951 who were the owners of the other half of the park. The Pippin's back half stood for several years (at least up until 1954) before finally being razed. Small parts of the coaster are buried in the ground and still visible as of 2020. A house now sits in its former path along Rocky Glen Rd, as the coaster actually went to the other side of the road. *Jazz Railway (1925‚Äì1927) Built by Harry G. Traver. Only existed for 3 years. It was situated on the top of the hill where the Million Dollar Coaster would be built. The design is sometimes referred to as \\"Jazz Rail Road\\". *Sterling's \\"Million Dollar\\" Roller Coaster (May 25,1946 ‚Äì January 1958) - Initially it was to be simply called \\"Sterling's Coaster\\" but advertisements stating, \\"Come ride Ben Sterling's 'Million Dollar' Roller Coaster,\\" led to the widespread use of the \\"Million Dollar\\" moniker. It was built in late 1945 for only $100,000, intended as the replacement for the Mountain Dips Coaster, which had closed in 1939 and was dismantled. The designer was Vernon Keenan (coaster designer) of the National Amusement Devices Company of Ohio (originally known as the Dayton Fun House, it was also the source of the coaster cars). Because of the lumber shortage at the time of the construction -- and a massive amount was needed for this coaster -- pieces of this coaster were built from the Fernbrook Park Coaster, the \\"Wildcat (1926-1945), which was located in Dallas, Pennsylvania. That coaster had closed in 1945, at the end of World War II. Sterling employed many union Seabees who were looking for work after their war service was over to build his coaster. Even though the Million Dollar Coaster had a very short life of 11 years, its size and thrills made it a legendary coaster of its time. Its initial drop was 96 feet high and approximately 4,700 feet long. Unfortunately, being close to the lake, ice and water had ruined and warped its supports over time and it was condemned in 1957. The Million Dollar coaster was dismantled in January and February of 1958 and parts of it carted across the frozen Rocky Glen lake and used to build the next (and last) coaster, the Jet Coaster, for the 1959 season (Rocky Glen operated with no coasters in 1958). In 1962, a brush fire destroyed the last remnants of the coaster (the beginning part of the lift hill and return track, which stood long after the main body was taken down around the water), which led to its final razing. These last remaining pieces were behind the Dodgems building and mostly hidden from sight in the park. This brush fire may have led to the belief that the entire coaster had burned in a fire, which was a long- standing, untrue rumor. The Dodgems building eventually was extended and used the defunct coaster's tracks as support beams for this extension. *Jet / Mighty Lightnin' / \\"Comet\\" Coaster (May 3, 1959 ‚Äì August 24, 1988) - Originally to be named the \\"Jet Age\\" and \\"Jet Star\\" Coaster, but later shortened to just the \\"Jet\\", it was designed by John C. Allen for the Philadelphia Toboggan Company (Coaster #126) and its construction supervised by Frank F. Hoover. It was built in late 1958 to replace Sterling's \\"Million Dollar\\" Coaster and when opened in 1959, it would be Rocky Glen's last major coaster. It was the staple of the later renamed Ghost Town in the Glen (later Ghost Town Park) and then New Rocky Glen. The lift hill was 55 feet high. The coaster stood after the closing of the park in 1987 for several years until parts of it were destroyed by a fire. The removal of the turn of the century airplane ride tower actually came down through the coaster crushing it in one spot. The coaster was finally demolished in December 1994 and bulldozed into the ground. Pieces are visible on the grounds as of 2019 at the vacant land. A twin sister of the Jet coaster exists in Stricker's Grove in Ohio known as the \\"Tornado\\" that is the same design, but it is a reversed mirror image. The father of both the Jet and the Tornado was the Monta√±a Rusa, located in Havana, Cuba as was the original design built in 1951. The Comet name was never official, but used as a nickname in the last years of operation, to coincide with repainted cars and mural with a space theme. This may have coincided with the return of Haley's Comet. The Mighty Lightnin' sign remained on the coaster well after the park closed. It had its last run at the Auction Day in 1988. *Monster Mouse (1982) was a steel wild mouse roller coaster coaster, built next to the Jet Coaster. Miniature Railroad The Clifford Twp. Volunteer Fire Company in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania is home to the 2nd miniature railroad that once existed at Rocky Glen Park. The train is a John A. Miller Company ride and added to Rocky Glen back in 1924 as a part of the Nallin-Jennings Park's side of Rocky Glen as the park at the time was split into two. (John Nallin and Joseph Jennings were the owners, who bought the property from Frothingham in 1921.) It operated in the same area the 1st Miniature Railroad did in 1904 with a slightly different path, which in the 1980s would be where the Jet Coaster was located. The railroad operated until the early 1950s, when Nallin-Jennings's side of Rocky Glen suffered the Fire of 1950, which destroyed Nallin-Jennings's 3 major rides including the Pippin Coaster, The Fun House (the remodeled Crystal Dance Pavilion) and the Tokio Canal water ride (an Old Mill type ride) along with Ben Sterling's Penny Arcade on May 24, 1950. With barely anything left but a few rides, what was left of Nallin-Jennings's side was sold to Benjamin & Lena Balka in December 1950, who in turn immediately sold it to Ben & Mae Sterling, who were the owners of the other half of the park in January 1951. Because Sterling now had control of the whole park, during the years of 1951 to 1954 they began removing the duplication of rides that existed on both sides of the park and, by 1954, finally tore down the back half of the Pippin Coaster which stood for 4 years. Sterling had his own Miniature Railroad (The 3rd one in the park's history) that went out along the \\"Million Dollar\\" Roller Coaster and was a much better attraction because of the proximity to the lake and large coaster. The now-former Nallin-Jennings Miniature Railroad was 'dismantled' and then sold by new owner Ben Sterling to persons from the Clifford Township Volunteer Fire Company, where it has remained with some modifications over the years to keep it going. As of 2020, it will be its 96th year in operation. Interesting facts *There have been at least 41 recorded deaths that happened on the property since it became a destination in late 1903. While most of these were drownings in the lake, there were also 4 roller coaster deaths, several persons electrocuted by the Laurel Line's third rail, and also a fatal airplane crash that ended up in the park with 3 people on board. *Rocky Glen never had a 'final day'. The park fully intended to open for 1988, but disagreements with the lease agreement between Park Manager Marvin Roth and Park landowner Gabe Warshawsky caused it to not open for 1988. *Contrary to popular belief, the famed Swiss Cottage was not the oldest building in the park. That title belonged to what would eventually be the Golden Nugget Casino by the 1980s. This circular building was originally the carousel house built in 1904 and went through different modifications and uses until it burned in the 1990s. *\\"Rocky Glen\\" as a name was first organized on February 11, 1901, where Arthur Frothingham along with his niece Annette Reynolds officially formed the Rocky Glen Water Company. The original plan was to build a dam to create a reservoir to provide water to the Lower Lackawanna Valley. This \\"public utility\\" was used as the main weapon against the Laurel Line from using eminent domain to take the land since a utility company would be exempt. After several lawsuits, they finally came to a mutual agreement in 1902. Coincidentally, Laura Frothingham's Letters of Patent on the land in 1886 was also filed on February 11, essentially making the date of February 11th Rocky Glen's \\"Birthday\\". *Ethnic Days did not begin at Rocky Glen, but they continued a tradition where local parks in the area once held them yearly. Park Manager Anthony \\"AJ\\" Duffy, who previously managed the Scranton Luna Park, continued this tradition when he took over management of Rocky Glen in 1919. *Ben Sterling had inquired into the possibility of the park continuing as a State Park in the late 1960s. His intention was to let the state take over the park so it could continue on into the future for the people of the valley. Unfortunately, the state would require the park to be sold off as they would not run rides or stands but use the lands only. Sterling would later opt to sell to National Recreation Service (Ghost Town in the Glen) in hopes that corporate money would be the way to keep it going on. Just 15 years after his death in 1973, the park would be gone. After the closure *The local congregation of Hare Krishna attempted to purchase the Rocky Glen Park grounds so it could erect a walled \\"City of God\\" on the site. Seven hundred residents signed petitions protesting the proposed sale, which fell through as a result.Jeff Pillets,\\"The Krishnas: It's sour music up in Moosic,\\" Wilkes-Barre Times, 4 February 1988, p. 1A. , cited in International Cultic Studies Association (The Cult Observer), 2001 *In 1988, the park's 1903 vintage Parker carousel was sold in auction for $220,000 as the park's facilities were being dismantled. It is important to note that Rocky Glen had several carousels over the years, and not one long-lasting carousel. * The Antique Cars and the Bumper Boats were sold to Knoebels Amusement Resort at the auction. While the Antique Cars are still running, the Bumper Boats were removed in 2015 to make way for the new steel coaster, Impulse. Most of the original cars have been cycled out for newer cars, which was confirmed by Knoebel's personnel.

Despite international outrage at the bombardment of the town, the United States refused to apologise for any damage or loss of life incurred, instead opting to avoid discussion of the incident until President Franklin Pierce finally gave an official position, six months later: > After giving a somewhat detailed and biased account of the bombardment, the > president concluded that while it would have been more satisfactory if the > Cyane's mission could have been consummated without the use of force, \\"the > arrogant contumacy of the offenders rendered it impossible to avoid the > alternative either to break up their establishment or to leave them > impressed with the idea that they might persevere with impunity in a career > of insolence and plunder.\\"Folkman, p. 68 References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Linder, Bruce, \\"Intertwined Heritage,\\" Naval History magazine (October 2007) - The role of the USS Cyane in first laying claim to San Diego * Folkman, D.

The original was created in Florence, Italy by Giovanni da Bologna, around the late 1580s. Each year the Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships award to the winner of each of 14 races a garland of flowers draped over the withers of the winning horse and four Breeders' Cup Trophy presented to the connections of the winners. \\"Breeders' Cup Trophy\\" is presented to the winner of every Breeders' Cup race Early history The horse is an ecorche, showing the muscles of the animal in detail. Its original purpose is unknown, but it may have been made as a study for the equestrian statue of Duke Cosimo I of Florence, cast in 1591. It has stood in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence since that date. The ecorche character gives the sculpture clarity and precision, combined with the grace and beauty of the living animal. This is evidence of a scientific as well as an artistic intention on the part of the artist and reveals the importance to him of the influence and example of Leonardo da Vinci. The most recent monumental equestrian sculpture in Florence, before that of Duke Cosimo I, had been da Vinci‚Äôs never-completed monument to Giangiacomo Trivulzio. The Torrie horse bears a close relationship to several drawings by da Vinci related to this project in the collection of Her Majesty the Queen at Windsor.Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships 2008 Media Guide, General Information, page 7. Other artists, too, knew and learned from da Vinci‚Äôs study of the horse, but none came so close as Giovanni da Bologna to his vision of the beauty of the animal celebrated by art and science together. The original ecorche bronze horse of Giovanni da Bologna is part of the University of Edinburgh Fine Art Collection in Scotland. The Edinburgh horse was acquired by Sir James Erskine of Torrie from the Villa Mattei in Rome, Italy in 1803. He bequeathed it to the University of Edinburgh with the rest of his collection of old master paintings and bronzes, and it came into the possession of the university in 1836. Current History The Breeders‚Äô Cup Trophy was cast from the original and was directly supervised and approved by the University of Edinburgh for the exclusive use of Breeders‚Äô Cup Limited. The largest version of the trophy is permanently owned by the Breeders‚Äô Cup Ltd, which displays it annually at the World Throughbred Championships venue. Replicas are presented to the owners of the winners of each of the Breeders‚Äô Cup World Championships races every year. The breeders, trainers and jockeys of each winning horse also are presented with replicas of the Breeders‚Äô Cup Trophy. Breeders Cup Blanket & Bouquet is draped over the winner of each Breeders' Cup race winner. In 1984 equestrian sculptor Irene French of Dorset, England was commissioned to sculpt an 11 inch high replica of the ‚ÄòTorrie Horse‚Äô. She completed this commission in 6 weeks. It was then cast in bronze by the Morris Singer Bronze Foundry of Basingstoke, England. This became the trophy for the American Breeders Cup, awarded annually to the winners of each of the Breeders Races. The Torrie bronze was thought to have been used to teach equine anatomy in the Middle Ages. It is said that the artist George Stubbs used the classic stance of the Torrie Horse to best display the muscles in his famous equine anatomical drawings.  Blanket of Flowers  Following a precedent started almost one hundred years ago, many of this country's highly esteemed grade one races award of a blanket of flowers draped over the withers of the winning horse. In the Breeders' Cup all 14 division races are adorned with this time honored tradition. The Official Flower Garland Provider of the Breeders‚Äô Cup is Kroger Floral Design Center, located in Louisville, Kentucky, it creates each of the 14 Championship race garlands. The official blanket of flower garland is made of the rare combinations of Beauty Asters, Golden Asters, Cremons and Catteleya Orchids, which are grown exclusively for the Breeders‚Äô Cup. The Kroger Floral Design Center has created the garlands since 1988. They have silk replicas of the official Breeders‚Äô Cup flower garland, at the Breeders‚Äô Cup Racing Office at (859) 514-9422. Each blanket has two wide saddle bag ends in an elongated pentagon shape that are adorned with a large purple circle emboldened with the Breeders' Cup logo and an embroidered script with the name of the race that was just won. The blanket is narrowed in the middle at the neck for ease of display over the horse and is topped with a full bouquet of both color Chrysanthemums with other floral embellishments. The blanket is 96\\" long from one end to the other.

Career One of the 'Big Three' in bass clarinet history, Henri Bok is a very active worldwide ambassador of his beloved instrument, one to which he has devoted his life as a performer, teacher, improviser and composer. His unique rich and warm sound can be heard on numerous recordings. Bok is noted for his new sound combinations leading to unusual instrumental groups: Duo Contemporain (with marimba/vibraphone), Duo Novair (with accordion), Bass Instincts (with bass oboe), Duo Clarones (bass clarinet duo with Luis Afonso 'Montanha'), Duo HeRo (with jazz pianist Rob van Bavel) and Duo Hevans (with Eleri Ann Evans, saxophones). Bok has also collaborated with fellow musicians Gustavo Beytelmann, Jos√© Luis Estell√©s, Mike Garson, Josef Hor√°k, Bennie Maupin, Justo Sanz, Louis Sclavis, Willem Tanke, Henri Tournier, Dawn Upshaw, Eric Vloeimans, and many others from all styles and genres. These collaborations have resulted in many new pieces dedicated to him. Bok has been professor of bass clarinet at Codarts/Rotterdam Superior Conservatoire (The Netherlands). He is professor of bass clarinet at Musikene (San Sebastian, Spain), as well as guest professor at the Robert Schumann Hochschule f√ºr Musik (D√ºsseldorf, Germany). He has just taken up a new position at the Fontys Hogeschool voor de Kunsten, Tilburg. Since 2000, he has also taught the bass clarinet class during the annual Julian Men√©ndez clarinet summer course in √Åvila (Spain). Bok is also professor of free improvisation and has performed at several improvisation festivals (amongst others in Tallinn, Estonia). New Techniques for the Bass Clarinet (www.shoepair.com), which Bok wrote in 1989 (revised in 2011), is considered to be the standard work for instrumentalists and composers interested in extended techniques. In 2005 Bok was the initiator and artistic director of the first World Bass Clarinet Convention, which took place in Rotterdam and was attended by more than five hundred bass clarinetists from all over the world. Following his first piece Vinho do Porto Brasileiro (1997), Bok has written a large number of solo works and chamber music. His compositions are published by Shoepair Music. In recognition of his exceptional contribution to music, Henri Bok was made a knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion by King Willem Alexander in April 2014. Bok is an endorser for Buffet Crampon , D'Addario reeds, Pomarico, and Wiseman bells and cases. Discography *\\"Duo Contemporain\\", with Miquel Bernat.

A popular venue for live entertainment (with the Dreamland Dance Hall),Avis A. Townsend, Newfane and Olcott (Arcadia Publishing 2005) it was open to the public from 1898 to 1927Jim Futrell, Amusement Parks of New York (Stackpole Books 2006) (predating the Coney Island Luna Park by five years). The name of the dance hall and the inscription on the arch spanning the park's main entrance led to the commonly used nickname of \\"Dreamland.\\" In contrast to the similarly named parks that were opened throughout the United States from 1903 to 1914, the primary attractions presented by the Olcott Beach Luna Park were not large rides like the Shoot-the-Chutes and roller coasters but a section of Lake Ontario shore (a popular swimming attraction), restaurants and concessions (shared by the park and nearby Castle Inn), and live entertainment (at Dreamland Dance Hall). Smaller-scale mechanical rides were gradually added, including a circle swing ride. While the \\"lives\\" of most of the other Luna Parks were relatively brief (virtually all were gone by 1915), the Olcott Beach park maintained its prominence as a popular recreation stop and a major venue for live entertainment into the 1910s, as Olcott Beach remained a popular stop for both steamboats along the shore of Lake Ontario and interurban trains connecting Albany, Niagara Falls, and Buffalo. At the end of World War I, Olcott Beach's prominence as a popular tourist destination faded quickly as the automobile replaced trains and steamboats as the city's primary method of access. As tourism dollars declined in the region, so did Luna Park and its main competitor, Rialto Park. While the crowds were dwindling in the 1920s, Luna Park managed to survive the 1926 season, its last in operation. The following year, a massive fire destroyed virtually every building on Cooper Street (including the Castle Inn and the train station across the street) and most of Main Street. Luna Park was destroyed. The beachside hotels could not be saved and were eventually razed. So was nearby Rialto Park (opened 1902): it was demolished in 1928. Olcott Beach didn't have any operating amusement parks until 1940, when Olcott Amusement Park opened amidst a resurgence of the city (staying in operation until 1986). New Rialto Park opened at the site of its namesake in 1942 and stayed in operation for 50 years. In 2003, Olcott Beach Carousel Park opened in the same location.Olcott Beach Carousel Park References Defunct amusement parks in the United States 1898 establishments in New York (state) 1927 disestablishments in New York (state) Defunct amusement parks in New York (state) Amusement parks in New York (state) ","title":"Luna Park, Olcott Beach"},{"id":"23842964","text":"Penelope ('Penny') Wilson is a British lecturer of Egyptology in the Department of Archaeology at Durham University, UK.

The trolley park was constructed and owned by the Broad Ripple Transit Company.John McDonald, Lost Indianapolis (Arcadia Publishing 2002) Similar to nearby rivals Riverside Amusement Park and Wonderland, White City was inspired by an exhibit in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Although the park's grand opening was immensely successful, White City's existence was the briefest of the three, having been open for two and one-half seasons before burning to the ground. Throughout the park's existence, advertisements touted White City as \\"the amusement park that satisfied\\".David J. Bodenhamer and Robert Graham Barrows, The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis (Indiana University Press 1994) Origin and grand opening White City arose during the national wave of increasing interest in amusement parks. The third of three major Indianapolis amusement parks to be opened in the space of three years, White City was incorporated on October 4, 1905. Officers of the corporation included Leon Bailey of New York City and Indianapolis residents Raymond Van Camp, Robert Light (president of the Broad Ripple Rapid Transit Company), Milton Huey, and John W.

Also similar to Wonderland, White City's main entrance was framed by two office buildings. After a visitor paid twenty cents to pass through the arch, the customer stepped onto the boardwalk while facing White City's bandstand. Attractions and exhibits Although White City was situated on land adjoining White River (as was Riverside Amusement Park to the south), the park's primary drawing cards were the rides and live entertainment. Along with contemporary staples Shoot-the-Chutes, merry-go-round, roller coasters (including a scenic railway through the park's many trees), a funhouse, and other mechanical rides, White City featured a baby incubator exhibit (made popular by Luna Parks on Coney Island and in Pittsburgh, but originated in the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Exposition),Hannah Lieberman, \\"Incubator Baby Shows: A Medical and Social Frontier,\\" The History Teacher, November 2001, cited in Indianapolis Amusement Parks 1903-1911: Landscapes on the Edge - Connie J.

Live entertainment in the form of marching bands (military and civilian), animal acts, acrobatics, and vaudeville was a staple of White City. A renovated theater building was transformed into a roller skating rink, and a dancing pavilion and a restaurant were built from scratch. An arcade (including a shooting gallery) was built alongside the midway near the Shoot- the-Chutes' lake. Other attractions included \\"The Fun Factory\\" and the Mystic Cave. A baseball diamond was also built. Aquatic activities were available when the park opened, with a community swimming pool and boat rides on the White River. In 1908, a two-story pavilion was opened at the riverside, along with a promenade. In addition, a large pool framed with a concrete-lined \\"bathing beach\\" was under construction as the park entered its third season of operation. Establishment and competition White City was the third of the three Indianapolis amusement parks to have opened (Riverside Amusement Park unveiled its mechanical rides in 1903, while Wonderland had its grand opening a week before White City in 1906), and the competition amongst the three trolley parks was intense for the brief existence of White City. The three parks battled for newspaper space in 1906, buying advertising on a regular basis to tout the parks' (especially Wonderland and White City) \\"newest attraction\\".By 1907, Riverside Amusement Park stopped buying ads in the Indianapolis Star as management opted to reduce advertising and construction costs. The Indianapolis News continued to run articles on Riverside Amusement Park as Wonderland and White City continued their advertising battles in the Star. At that time, it became evident that, despite the continuing popularity of the three parks, Indianapolis could not sustain all three as the nationwide amusement park boom started to subside in the latter third of the first decade of the twentieth century. While Riverside Amusement Park tried to survive by reducing expenditures (it stayed in business until 1970), White City and Wonderland tried different tacks in trying to boost their attendance to overcome the increased costs of insurance and construction. White City started to emphasize its live performances and its natural settings (offering more activities near the bank of the White River), while landlocked Wonderland continued the upgrading of its mechanical rides. In 1907, White City added \\"Paris by Night\\", \\"Kemp's Model City\\", a \\"mysterious flying lady\\", and a billiard hall. White City was the first Indianapolis amusement park to open that year, and its management took advantage by advertising \\"all roads lead to White City\\" in the week before the opening of Wonderland.White City advertisement, Indianapolis Star 5 May 1907, cited in Indianapolis Amusement Parks 1903-1911: Landscapes on the Edge - Connie J.

All three parks offered pyrotechnics for their Decoration Day celebrations, but White City also offered a re-enactment of the Thaw-White Tragedy in which New York City architect Stanford White was shot by Harry Thaw after the latter accused the former of seducing Thaw's wife, Evelyn Nesbit.The incident was documented in a 1907 film, The Unwritten Law: A Thrilling Drama Based on the Thaw-White Tragedy, starring Nesbitt as herself. http://movies.amctv.com/person/52271/Evelyn-Nesbit/details As the dog days of summer 1907 ensued, White City increased its emphases on water activities and its picnic grounds as weekly promotions not involving the mechanical rides appeared regularly in editions of the Indianapolis Star and the Indianapolis News.\\"Eat; Run Races; Dance and have Tug of War,\\" Indianapolis News 20 July 1907, cited in Indianapolis Amusement Parks 1903-1911: Landscapes on the Edge - Connie J.

Appleton and Company 1916) After the fire The park remained closed for three years. The Union Traction Company of Indiana bought it on March 6, 1911, quickly restored it, and operated it for eleven years. The pool was the main attraction, with new buildings (boathouse, dance hall, dining hall) and playground equipment to complement it. It was billed as the largest pool in the world, being long and wide, in an effort to bolster weekend traffic on the company's interurban rail line. The pool would host three prominent events: the 1922 National Swimming Event and the Olympic tryouts of 1924 and 1952. In the 1924 event Johnny Weissmuller, of Tarzan fame, won the 100-meter freestyle qualifier. In May 1922, the park was sold to the new Broad Ripple Amusement Park Association, who soon changed the park's name to Broad Ripple Amusement Park. In 1927 the park was again sold, this time to Oscar Baur, a brewery executive from Terre Haute, Indiana.Bodenhamer 354 Broad Ripple Park Carousel, now located at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis By 1938 the park boasted of its concrete pool, billed as \\"the world's largest\\", of free parking, a new ballroom, and mechanized rides. The Board of Parks Commission of Indianapolis bought the property on May 18, 1945, paying $131,500 for the property, and converted the grounds into a city park, which was once again named Broad Ripple Park. The city filled in the swimming pool, sold some of the remaining rides, and destroyed all of the unsold ones except for the 1917-vintage carousel, which it continued to operate until the carousel's condition deteriorated. The animal figures Broad Ripple Park Carousel were purchased by The Children's Museum of Indianapolis starting in 1966. The museum restored and mounted the figures on a new carousel mechanism. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987, the carousel is still in operation at the museum.Carousel page - The Children's Museum of IndianapolisBroad Ripple Park Carousel - National Historic Landmark page The steam locomotive was eventually relocated to the Indiana Transportation Museum in Noblesville, Indiana.Broad Ripple Park References Defunct amusement parks in the United States 1906 establishments in Indiana 1908 disestablishments in Indiana Tourism in Indianapolis Amusement parks in Indiana ","title":"White City (Indianapolis)"},{"id":"23843146","text":"The Eclipse Award for \\"Horse of the Year\\" displayed on the front panel of a brochure provided by the Thoroughbred Racing Association to promote the event of the Eclipse Award Ceremonies The Eclipse Award Trophy is presented annually to recognize those horses and individuals whose outstanding achievements have earned them the title of Champion in their respective categories. Presently there are twenty categories that include American Horse of the Year, eleven Division Champions, five connection Champions and three miscellaneous awards. The Eclipse Awards are co-sponsored by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, the Daily Racing Form and the National Turf Writers Association. Prior to the start of the Eclipse Awards in 1971, the TRA and the Daily Racing Form separately honored racing's annual champions.Thoroughbred Racing Associations website; .  History  The Eclipse Awards are named after the great 18th-century English racehorse and sire, Eclipse, who did not begin racing until age five. He was undefeated in 18 starts, including eight walkovers. Eclipse sired the winners of 344 races, three of his get winning the Epsom Derby. The Eclipse Award Trophy was designed by acclaimed Lexington, Kentucky artist Adalin Wichman in 1971. Wichman based her bronze trophy on an 18th-century painting of Eclipse. Her husband, architect William Wichman, designed the award's walnut base. Ms. Wichman holds the Eclipse copyright and has produced each sculpture, working only with a few small selected American foundries with expertise in studio bronze casting by the lost wax method. An Eclipse Award Trophy is presented to the winner in each of eleven horse divisions that include;American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly, American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse, American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, American Champion Older Male Horse, American Champion Older Female Horse, American Champion Sprint Horse, American Champion Female Sprint Horse, American Champion Male Turf Horse, American Champion Female Turf Horse and Outstanding Steeplechase horse. The winner of the Eclipse Award allows the horse in each of the eleven categories to be designated as a \\"Champion\\" for the rest of their racing and breeding careers. Five Eclipse Awards Trophies are presented to humans based on their affiliations to their horses. Those five categories are; Outstanding Owner, Outstanding Breeder, Outstanding Trainer, Outstanding Jockey and Outstanding Apprentice Jockey. At the end of the Eclipse Award evening the coveted select solid gold Eclipse Award trophy is presented to the American Horse of the Year. Each statue is hand finished, following the casting, by cleaning, patching, colouring and waxing using classical bronze sculpture finishing techniques by the artist to its final form and luster.

Microglial cells of this transgenic mouse produce GFP that allows cells to be visualised (green). The ability of microglial cells (green) to extend toward a laser lesion is reduced in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease mice. Œ≤-amyloid plaques (blue) are always present in brains of Alzheimer patients . Intravital microscopy is a form of microscopy that allows observing biological processes in live animals (in vivo) at a high resolution that makes distinguishing between individual cells of a tissue possible. Before an animal can be used for intravital microscopy imaging it has to undergo a surgery involving implantation of an imaging window. For example, if researchers want to visualize liver cells of a live mouse they will implant an imaging window into mouse‚Äôs abdomen. Mice are the most common choice of animals for intravital microscopy but in special cases other rodents such as rats might be more suitable. Animals are always anesthetized throughout surgeries and imaging sessions. Intravital microscopy is used in several areas of research including neurology, immunology, stem cell and others. This technique is particularly useful to assess a progression of a disease or an effect of a drug. Basic Concept Intravital microscopy involves imaging cells of a live animal through an imaging window that is implanted into the animal tissue during a special surgery. The main advantage of intravital microscopy is that it allows imaging living cells while they are in the true environment of a complex multicellular organism. Thus, intravital microscopy allows researchers to study the behavior of cells in their natural environment or in vivo rather than in a cell culture. Another advantage of intravital microscopy is that the experiment can be set up in a way to allow observing changes in a living tissue of an organism over a period of time. This is useful for many areas of research including immunology and stem cell research. High quality of modern microscopes and imaging software also permits subcellular imaging in live animals that in turn allows studying cell biology at molecular level in vivo. Advancements in fluorescent protein technology and genetic tools that enable controlled expression of a given gene at a specific time in a tissue of interest also played important role in intravital microscopy development. The possibility of generating appropriate transgenic mice is crucial for intravital microscopy studies. For example, in order to study the behavior of microglial cells in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease researchers will need to crossbreed a transgenic mouse that is a mouse model of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease with another transgenic mouse that is a mouse model for visualization of microglial cells. Cells need to produce a fluorescent protein to be visualized and this can be achieved by introducing a transgene. Imaging Intravital microscopy setup. Confocal microscope to collect images and PC monitor to display images generated. Equipment required to keep the animal under anaesthesia and to monitor its body temperature is not shown Microscope stage used for intravital microscopy imaging Intravital microscopy can be performed using several light microscopy techniques including widefield fluorescence, confocal, multiphoton, spinning disc microscopy and others. The main consideration for the choice of a particular technique is the penetration depth needed to image the area and the amount of cell-cell interaction details required. If the area of interest is located more than 50‚Äì100 ¬µm below the surface or there is a need to capture small-scale interactions between cells, multiphoton microscopy is required. Multiphoton microscopy provides considerably greater depth of penetration than single-photon confocal microscopy. Multiphoton microscopy also allows visualizing cells located underneath bone tissues such as cells of the bone marrow. The maximum depth for the imaging with multiphoton microscopy depends on the optical properties of the tissue and experimental equipment. The more homogenous the tissue is the better it is suited for intravital microscopy. More vascularized tissues are generally more difficult to image because red blood cells cause absorption and scattering of the microscope light beam. Fluorescence labeling of different cell lineages with differently coloured proteins allows visualizing cellular dynamics in a context of their microenvironment. If the image resolution is high enough (50 ‚Äì 100 Œºm) it can be possible to use several images to generate 3D models of cellular interactions, including protrusions that cells make while extending toward each other. 3D models from time-lapse image sequences allow assessing speed and directionality of cellular movements. Vascular structures can also be reconstructed in 3D space and changes of their permeability can be monitored throughout a period of time as fluorescent signal intensity of dyes changes when vascular permeability does. High resolution intravital microscopy can be used to visualize spontaneous and transient events. It might be useful to pair up multiphoton and confocal microscopy as this allows getting more information from every imaging session. This includes visualization of more different cell types and structures to obtain more informative images and using a single animal to obtain images of all the different cell types and structures that are of interest for a given experiment. This latter is an example of The Three Rs principle implementation. =Imaging Subcellular Structures= In the past, intravital microscopy could only be used to image biological processes at tissue or single-cell levels. However, due to development of subcellular labeling techniques and advances in minimizing motion artifacts (errors generated by heartbeat, breath and peristaltic movements of an animal during imaging session) it is now becoming possible to image dynamics of intracellular organelles in some tissues. Limitations of Intravital Microscopy One of the main advantages of intravital microscopy is the opportunity to observe how cells interact with their microenvironment. However, visualization of all the cell types of the microenvironment is limited by the number of distinguishable fluorescent labels available. It is also widely accepted that some tissues such as brain can be visualized easier than others such as skeletal muscle. These differences occur due to variability in homogeneity and transparency of different tissues. In addition, generating transgenic mice with a phenotype of interest and fluorescent proteins in appropriate cell types is often challenging and time consuming. Another problem associated with the use of transgenic mice is that it is sometimes difficult to interpret changes observed between a wild-type mouse and a transgenic mouse that represents the phenotype of interest. The reason for this is that genes of similar function can often compensate for the altered gene that leads to some degree of adaptation.

He graduated from the post-graduate Naval War College, the Imperial Naval Academy (Marineakademie) in 1874 in a class with three other future admirals: Otto von Diederichs, Felix von Bendemann, Gustav von Senden- Bibran.By order of the Kaiser, p. 113 Commissioned into the Prussian navy in 1857, Valois fought at the Battle of Jasmund in 1864. Between 1865 and 1868 he circumnavigated the world and later served in the Franco-Prussian War as captain of . He sank or captured several French ships before being blockaded in Vigo until the end of the war. In 1890 he became commander of the German East Asia Squadron. Towards the end of his naval career and in retirement he was active in the debate regarding the role of the German navy. Valois supported creating a fleet of light commerce raiders, as opposed to the orthodoxy of building up a battleship force for a decisive fleet action. He wrote several influential books and pamphlets. Family SMS Arcona The gun- runner Itata in San Diego Bay in 1891 According to family legend, Valois' great-grandfather was lured from France to Switzerland during the Seven Years' War, where he was conscripted into Habsburg service. During the Prussian victory at Liegnitz he was among the 4,700 Austrian prisoners, and was persuaded to join the Prussian military. After the war he settled in the town of Prussian Holland, a village settled by Dutch refugees during the fourteenth century. (The town is now called Pas≈Çƒôk and is part of modern-day Poland.) The son of the erstwhile prisoner became a merchant, and his son, while studying to be a justice, married the daughter of one of the deputies of the Prussian Parliament, Antonie Pohl-Senslau.Memim Enclopedia, Victor Valois,, 2015, Accessed 29 August 2015.

Afterward he joined the Corvette Amazone on a training cruise around the Baltic Sea. In 1861 he joined the Frigate Thetis for a three-year cruise to East Asia. At the outbreak of the Prussian war with Denmark he was officer of the watch on the steam-powered Gunboat Loreley, under command of Captain Hans Kuhn. On 17 March 1864 he participated in the naval battle at Jasmund. At the end of the war in 1866 the Prussian navy was transferred to the North German Confederation. From 1865 to 1868, Valois circumnavigated the world on the steam frigate Vineta, and subsequently on the sail corvette Nymphe. With the rest of the crew of Nymph, he transferred to the S.M.S. Augusta, a lieutenant commander, where he was both second officer and navigation officer. After a brief supply trip to Kiel, he served as the navigator for the steam corvette around the British Isles. The ship attacked several vessels of the French government at Bordeaux, taking two as prizes, and sinking a steamship loaded with supplies for the French Army. Subsequently, Augusta took refuge in the Spanish harbour at Vigo, where it was blockaded by three French warships until 1871, when the ship returned to Kiel. Valois commanded the corvette (France, 1863) in February 1881 on a cruise to Liberia to protest a native attack on the shipwrecked crew of a German merchant ship. He exacted a monetary fine from the Liberian government and shelled the village of the natives involved in the attack.The United States and Africa: A History by Peter Duignan, Lewis H. Gann; Cambridge University Press, 1987. 450 pages, pp. 120‚Äì121. In early 1890 he left the position of Director (Oberwerftdirektor) of the Imperial Shipyard in Kiel to become commander of the German East Asia Squadron. In December 1890 he was in Australia with , SMS Leipzig, and .New York Times, December 24, 1990, P. 6 The purpose of the East Asia Squadron was to protect and promote imperialist interest in Asia and the Pacific. On 21 December 1890 he was as Samoa with his squadron in connection with German plans to annex the Marshall Islands when an approaching hurricane caused him to flee in his flagship Leipzig.The Brisbane Courier, 13 January 1891. p. 3 This was a period of tensions and rivalries in the Pacific between the great powers, including Germany and the United States. This tension was increased slightly when Valois brought his squadron into San Francisco on 4 June 1891 without the expected courtesy of raising an American flag. Perhaps it was for this reason that Admiral Andrew E. K. Benham, commander of Mare Island Station did not visit Valois. This was during the 1891 Chilean Civil War and he was soon ordered south where, along with US and British navies, he was involved in the search for the gun-running Chilean ship Itata (Itata Incident).Sacramento Record-Union, November 16, 1891, Page 2. Retirement The late 1890s were a period of conflict within the Imperial German navy. By this time, Alfred von Tirpitz, who favored the construction of heavy ships in direct competition with Britain, had come to power as the State Secretary of the Naval Office. In 1898, Tirpitz secured passage of the 1898 naval law, which emphasized a fleet strength that relied on battle ships and heavy cruisers. In 1899 Valois had written a book favoring cruisers if war came with Britain. Such ships, light and fast, could attack Great Britain's merchant ships in case of war. Ships of the great tonnage, called capital ships, were expensive and time consuming to build, and, according to Valois, would not serve the German marine well.By order of the Kaiser, p. 230Patrick J. Kelly, Tirpitz and the Imperial German Navy, Indiana University Press, 2011, p. 164. This strategic philosophy, with its emphasis on cruisers, did not match William's (or Tirpitz's) concept of an appropriate German navy that could compete in weight, size, and impressive appearance with the vast British fleet.Beatrice Heuser, The Evolution of Strategy: Thinking of War from Antiquity to the Present, Cambridge, 2010, p. 246. Additional work His book Seekraft Seegeltung Seeherrschaft published in 1899 caused a stir of interest in international naval circles as in it he admitted that the German naval build up was directed at Britain and proposed that mutual interest of the United States and Germany should lead to an alliance against Britain.New York Times, October 8, 1899, p. 4. He was considered a progressive in the naval related questions of the time, such as foreign colonies, even after his retirement. As a member of the Kolonialrat (colonial advisory board) he was the only supporter of a 1901 proposal to free all slaves in Germany‚Äôs African colonies by 1920. Valois proposed that all children born to slaves should be born free, but this was overruled as \\"premature\\" and the board objected strongly to the proposal.Mission und Macht im Wandel politischer Orientierungen: europ√§ische Missionsgesellschaften in politischen Spannungsfeldern in Afrika und Asien zwischen 1800 und 1945, by Ulrich van der Heyden, Holger Stoecker; Franz Steiner Verlag, 2005 700 pages. p. 49. He was long a foe of the United Kingdom and supported a strong cruiser fleet as the most feasible way to fight her in any future war. In the April 1910 issue of √úberall, the magazine of the Navy League (Flottenverein), he published a violently anti-British article, \\"Our Navy in the Service of the Colonial Movement\\". In it he wrote \\"there is at present no greater menace to the world's peace than the presumption of England.\\"An Australian In Germany, by A. D. McLaren, London, Constable and Co.

Belmont Trophy Anonymous artist's rendition of the Belmont Cup, 1896. The trophy was designed by Paulding Farnham at the behest of August Belmont Jr. Tiffany & Co. was commissioned by August Belmont Jr. in 1896 to create a silver cup in memory of his late father August Belmont, the namesake of the Belmont Stakes, to be presented to the winner of the 1896 event. Using 350 ounces of sterling silver, Paulding Farnham crafted a 27-inch high, acorn-shaped bowl supported by a pedestal composed of three Thoroughbred horse statues representing the foundation stallions Eclipse, Matchem and Herod. The bowl was 15 inches across and 14 inches at the base and had a prominent acorn and oak motif symbolizing the development of modern racing Thoroughbreds from the three foundation sires. The lid was crowned with a statue of the elder Belmont's racehorse Fenian who secured Belmont's first win in the Belmont Stakes in 1869. Plans for the cup were unveiled on June 2, the day of the running at Morris Park Racecourse, while the cup was finished the following year in 1897. The cup cost $1,000 to create and augmented the $4,000 in prize money given to the race winner. August Belmont, Jr. himself won the Cup when Hastings won the race. Paulding Farnham made several additional Belmont Stakes trophies that were distributed from 1897 to 1907. From 1896 until 1926, this trophy remained with the Belmont family. In 1926, Mrs. Eleanor R. Belmont, the widow of Major August Belmont II, donated the trophy to the Westchester Racing Association, then a governing body of New York racing, to be established as the permanent trophy for the race. In a letter to Mrs. Belmont dated June 8, 1926, Westchester Racing Secretary John J. Coakley wrote: ‚ÄúAs desired by you, the Cup will be known in the future as the August Belmont Memorial Cup and will be contested for annually in the renewal of the ‚ÄòBelmont Stakes‚Äô at Belmont Park, the winner of each renewal to retain possession of the Cup until the succeeding year.‚Äù  Silver trays  In addition to be presented the permanent trophy for ceremonial purposes only, the winning owner of the Belmont Stakes receives a large silver tray upon which the names of previous Belmont are engraved. This tradition also dates back to 1926, when the Westchester Racing Association committed to present to the winner each year ‚Äúa suitable plate to become the property of such winning owner.‚Äù The winning trainer, jockey and exercise rider also receive silver trays, while the winning groom is given race mementos.

A central span carries automobile and some motorcycle traffic while narrower spans on either side carry most motorcycle traffic along with bicycle pedestrian traffic. The central bridge is 481.6 meters in length.Major Early Projects: II. Bridge Construction at the Directorate General of Highways of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications website History Qing Empire Governor Liu Mingchuan had acquired imperial approbation to develop rapid transport to the newly designated capital of the island, Taiwan-fu, which was situated in the central part of Formosa. Work building the railway started in 1887 and continued into 1893, and was to go from Keelung to Hsinchu. =1889 bridge= As the line runs south from Twatutia, a bridge was needed to cross the Tamsui River, which was about wide at Twatutia. An iron bridge was proposed by engineers but was deemed too expensive. Construction of a wooden bridge was started in 1887,ËéäÊ∞∏ÊòéÊïôÊéà. „ÄéÂè∞ÂåóÂ§ßÊ©ãÊ≠∑Âè≤„Äè.

The bridge, known as the Tamsui Wooden Bridge (Ê∑°Ê∞¥Êú®Ê©ã; D√†nshu«ê M√πqi√°o; TƒÅm-s√∫i- boÃçk-ki√¥), was a (1498 chi) wooden structure designed to carry only rail traffic. Foot and horse traffic could also cross on paths on either side of the rail. However, the bridge's wood pilings required frequent repair due to periodic flooding,Tales of Sanchong at Sanchong City Government website and an August 1897 typhoon seriously damaged the bridge. After Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895, Governor-General of Taiwan decided to reroute the railway to the south through Pankio (Banqiao). In 1899, the railway was removed and the bridge was renovated for other vehicular access. The bridge was an important connection between the commercial entrep√¥ts of Dalongdong and Twatutia (a part of Taipei) and the largely undeveloped area that would become Sanchong. A market at the foot of the bridge on the Taipei side of the river that would become the Yanping North Road Night Market was formerly called the Taipei Bridge Night Market (Â§ßÊ©ãÂ§úÂ∏Ç D√†qi√°o Y√®sh√¨; Â§ßÊ©ãÂ§úÂ∏Ç‰ªî T≈ça-ki√¥ IƒÅ-chhƒ´-√°).Yanping N.

This bridge was also nicknamed the \\"Seven-Pillar Iron Bridge\\" (‰∏ÉÊ†ºÈêµÊ©ã Qƒ´ G√© Tiƒõqi√°o; Chhit Keh Thih-ki√¥). The bridge became a critical link for people and trade between Taipei and areas to the south and west. It played a role in the rapid growth of Sanchong's population as migrants flooding north to Taipei used the city as a first stop before gaining the means to move to Taipei itself. The bridge was also an important scenic landmark and the \\"Iron Bridge sunset\\" (ÈêµÊ©ãÂ§ïÁÖß Tiƒõqi√°o xƒ´zh√†o; Thih-ki√¥ seÃçk-chi√†u) was considered one of the eight scenic highlights of Taipei.ÈÅôÊÜ∂„ÄåÂè∞ÂåóÂ§ßÊ©ã„ÄçÂΩ±ÂÉèÁ¥Ä‰∫ã.

This Taipei Bridge was tolled until the early 1990s when the tolls on all bridges over Tamsui River were removed. Manned guard posts remained on the bridge until its replacement in the mid-1990s. Current structure The bridge was proposed in 1991 and, on 16 July 1996, it was opened to traffic. The main (central) bridge carries six lanes of automobile traffic and two lanes of motorcycle and bicycle traffic as it crosses the river. Two adjacent two-lane bridges carry motorcycle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic only.These adjacent bridges were completed before the main structure and carried all traffic while the 1969 bridge was demolished and the new bridge was constructed. The approaches to the bridge are significantly narrower than the bridge as it crosses the river due to heavy urban development on all sides. On the Taipei side, approaches to the bridge from M√≠nqu√°n Road begin at D√†l√≥ng Street before Ch√≥ngq√¨ng Road. These are joined by an additional center approach from west of Ch√≥ngq√¨ng Road. The approaches for the cycle bridges are west of Y√°np√≠ng Road. On the Sanchong side, the bridges begin at the intersection of Ch√≥ngxƒ´n Road with F√∫d√© Road and are joined by ramps from the elevated Hu√°nh√© Expressway that passes above Taipei Bridge. The bridge formerly carried Provincial Highway No. 1 and now carries Provincial Highway No. 1A (1Áî≤), the former having been rerouted to Zhongxiao Bridge.

Although she made a number of appearances with opera companies throughout the French provinces and on the international stage, her career was mainly centered at the Palais Garnier and the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris. She particularly excelled in the works of Jules Massenet and was an exponent of the works of Camille Erlanger.Chenal Biography of Marthe Chenal at operissimo.com (in German) Chenal was admired not only for her excellent singing but also her dramatic prowess, with a number of critics comparing her to the great French dramatic actress Sarah Bernhardt. A remarkably attractive woman, Chenal was dubbed by the international press as \\"the most beautiful woman in Paris\\". She was noted for her rendition of La Marseillaise. Her voice is preserved on a number of recordings made with Path√© Records in 1915. Biography Born in Paris, Chenal was educated at the convent at the Basilique du Sacr√©-C≈ìur, Paris. She entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1901 where she was initially advised by all of her teachers to pursue a career outside of music. One teacher even went as far as to suggest that she pursue a career at the Moulin Rouge. Undaunted, Chenal continued to pursue opera studies under Martini and in 1905, her final year, she won first prize in the conservatoire's singing competition. Chenal made her professional opera debut in 1905 at the Palais Garnier as Brunehild in Ernest Reyer's Sigurd. She continued to sing in that opera house for the next three years in such roles as Elizabeth in Richard Wagner's Tannh√§user, Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust, Donna Anna in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Don Giovanni and the title role in Jules Massenet's Ariane. In 1908, Chenal joined the roster of principal singers at the Op√©ra-Comique, making her debut with the company in the title role of Camille Erlanger's Aphrodite. She sang frequently at the Op√©ra-Comique throughout the rest of her career, notably appearing in several world premieres with the company; including Gabriel Piern√©'s On ne badine pas avec l'amour, Alfred Bruneau's Le Roi Candaule, and Erlanger's La sorci√®re. Between 1908-1910 Chenal made a number of lauded appearances at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo, including the title roles in Camille Saint-Sa√´ns' Proserpine, Alexander Dargomyzhsky's Rusalka, and Giacomo Puccini's Tosca among others. She later returned to Monte Carlo in 1926 to portray the title role in Georges Bizet's Carmen. In 1909, Chenal starred in the world premiere of Camille Erlanger's Bacchus triomphant at the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Bordeaux. The following year she returned to the Op√©ra National de Paris to appear in the world premiere of Georges H√ºe's Le miracle. After 1910, she spent the next thirteen years performing roles at both the Palais Garnier and the Op√©ra-Comique. Her last opera appearance was at the Op√©ra-Comique in 1923 as Margared in √âdouard Lalo's Le roi d'Ys. Outside France Chenal made only a few appearances. She sang at the Manhattan Opera House in New York City a few times during her career. In 1917, she appeared at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome in the title role of Massenet's Sapho and gave a concert of French opera arias at La Scala in Milan.

Within those pages, an incredible picture begins to take shape of a long lost city in the jungles of Brazil and the apparently true legend of a red-headed race, possibly descended from ancient Celtic Druids. Fascinated by such a prospect, and with the lovely Deidre Campbell at his side, Indiana Jones sets out for the Amazon. However, as usual, getting there will prove to be the true adventure. And if he does manage to survive the journey, who can tell what dangers await within the mythical city itself.

Established in the Province of New York in 1686, the Court remained in existence in the Province and, after the American Revolution, in the U.S. state of New York until it was abolished in 1894. James Wilton Brooks wrote in History of the Court of common pleas of the city and county of New York (1896) that: > The Court of Common Pleas, founded in 1686, in the City of New York, > extended in 1691 throughout the State, restricted again in 1846 to the City > of New York, and finally, in accordance with the amended State Constitution > of 1894, passing out of existence on the thirty-first of December, 1895, was > the oldest judicial tribunal in the state of New York. It succeeded \\"The > Worshipful Court of the Schout, Burgomasters and Schepens\\", which was > established in 1653 and may thus be said to have had a continuous existence > of nearly two centuries and a half.Brooks, James Wilton. History of the > Court of common pleas of the city and county of New York. New York: 1896. New Netherland The Dutch West India Company established the colony of New Netherland, centered around New Amsterdam in Manhattan, in 1623. Brooks wrote that for many years no provision was made for the administration for justice in the colony. In 1623, Peter Minuit, shortly after being appointed Director- General of New Netherland, formed a council of five, which held legislative, executive, and judicial powers. A Dutch colonial official called the Schout was also attached to this body. Together the Governor, Schout, and Council were supervised by the Dutch colonial authorities at Amsterdam. These authorities carried out judicial powers from 1626 to 1637, during Minuit's six years as Director-General and during four years of the term of his successor, Wouter van Twiller. Although records were kept, no records have survived detailing judicial proceedings under the Council. The Schout Fiscal was a combination of prosecutor, sheriff, chief of police, constable, and warden with the duty to \\"under the orders of the Governor's Council to arrest and arraign on behalf of the Company all persons accused of crime, to superintend the trial, and see to the proper carrying out of the sentence.\\" Despite this concentration of powers, however, some rights of the accused were observed, including the consideration of evidence for the prisoner and a speedy trial. The Schout was also required to \\"keep a strict account of all information taken by him and of all criminal trials, and regularly transmit reports to the Company's main offices in Holland.\\" The Schout also has executive power to enforce the laws and rules of the States-General of the Netherlands. Patroon courts were first established in 1630. Patroons (from the Dutch for owner or head of a company) were landholders with manorial rights to large tracts of land in New Netherland in North America along the Hudson River. Through the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions of 1629, the Dutch West India Company first started to grant this title and land to some of its invested members. These inducements to foster immigration were known as the \\"Rights and Exemptions,\\" more commonly known as the patroon system. patroon acted as feudal lords, with the power to create civil and criminal courts, appoint local officials and hold land in perpetuity, and in return was commissioned by the Dutch West India Company to establish a settlement of at least 50 families within four years on the land. The patroon exercised within his authority \\"unlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction...even the power of life and death,\\" subject to an appeal to the Governor. When Peter Stuyvesant became governor in 1647, he immediately established a Court of Justice with the broad jurisdiction to decide \\"all cases whatsoever,\\" with the directive to refer cases of any importance to the governor for approval. Brooks wrote that this scheme produced \\"popular discount,\\" resulting in a \\"wrangle between the governor and the colonies, which brought about a number of trips to Holland, covered a number of years and abounded in dramatic incidents.\\" This led to the formation in 1653, of The Worshipful Court of the Schout, Burgomasters and Schepens. This tribunal consisted of the Schout, four Burgomasters, and nine Schepens. Like the Schout, the position of the Burgomaster and Schepen came from the Netherlands. The Burgomasters were administrators who rotated three-month terms \\"to attend at City Hall for the dispatch of public business.\\" Schepens (aldermen) were judicial officers with jurisdiction over civil and criminal matters. Together, the three orders of officers formed a college and enacted laws and ordinances for the city, analogous to the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The body, collectively known as the Lords of the Court of the City of New Amsterdam, was headed either by a chosen president or the senior Burgomaster. The court was held at least every two weeks and often every week; the parties before the court stated the case and the judges rendered a decision based on the facts or arbitrators were appointed to review the case and proposed a compromise between the parties. Appeals to the court from the arbitrators' decisions were rare. In the case of a difference in how parties stated the facts, witnesses were called and affidavits presented or depositions taken. Province of New York In 1664 the colony became part of British North America as the Province of New York, and New Amsterdam was named New York. The Court of Common Pleas was established in New York City in 1686 under the Dongan Charter, the early municipal Charter of the City of New York, granted by Governor Thomas Dongan on July 22, 1686. The Charter provided that the Mayor, Recorder, and Alderman, or any three of them given that either the Recorder or Mayor was one, were authorized to hold the Court of Common Pleas (Mayor's Court), which was presided over by the Mayor and Recorder alternately. An Act of 1691 created a Court of Common Pleas in each of New York's counties, which at the time numbered 12. Judges and clerks were appointed by the governor of New York and held office at his pleasure or during good behavior. The court's jurisdiction extended to all actions in which the amount in controversy exceeded five English pounds. After 1691, appeals to the decisions of the court went to the Supreme Court of the Province of New York, which heard appeals in which the amount involved exceeded 20 pounds. Brooks wrote that the Court of Common Pleas was often known under the original Dutch title, even as late as 1821, and was called the Mayors' Court, with its criminal branch known as the New York Court of General Sessions. New York City The Mayor's Court was continued through the colonial period, and records are uncertain as to whether the court was held during the American Revolutionary War. In early 1784, James Duane was appointed mayor of New York City, and from that time after the Court was in continuing existence until its abolition. Under Duane, who served in the Continental Congress, notable figures including Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, Robert Troup, Edward Livingston, Henry Brockholst Livingston, Egbert Benson, Morgan Lewis, and Josiah Ogden Hoffman practiced before the Court. Duane presided until 1789, when the President George Washington appointed him to the U.S. District Court for the District of New York. When Maturin Livingston was Recorder of New York City, Mayor DeWitt Clinton ceased to preside in the Mayor's Court, and from that time on the Recorder sat as presiding judge. By 1821, the mayor had ceased to preside completely as the docket had increased substantially in size. John Anthon, a prominent lawyer, wrote an act to change the name to the Court of Common Pleas of the City of New York, and to create the position of First Judge. The New York Legislature passed the bill. Although the Mayor, Recorder, and Aldermen still had the power to preside over the Court of Common Pleas, the First Judge was given special responsibility for the court and had the power to hold court himself without the Recorder or Mayor. John T. Irving was appointed First Judge. In 1834, an Associate Judge was provided, with all the powers of the First Judge. Michael Ulshoffer was appointed to the post. In 1839, a third judge was provided for due to an increase in the court's workload; William Inglis was appointed as Associate Judge. Charles Patrick Daly served as a judge of the New York Court of Common Pleas 1844‚Äì1857, as First Judge 1857-1871, and as Chief Justice 1871-1885. The Court of Common Pleas for the City of New York was abolished in 1895.

It took place in 16 counties of southeastern provinces of the country, or eastern Galicia. This area was in the interbellum part of the eastern Lesser Poland province. Therefore, in Ukrainian and Polish literature this event is also called \\"Pacification in Eastern Galicia\\" () and \\"Pacification of Eastern Lesser Poland\\" (), respectively. Background Eastern Galicia was incorporated by the Polish republic after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire and the defeat of the short-lived Western Ukrainian People's Republic. After the war, in 1920‚Äì1921, approximately 100,000 Ukrainians, and Jews as well as people of other ethnicity who had supported Ukrainian independence, were interred in concentration campsConcentration camps Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine. Originally published in Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 1 (1984). University of Toronto Press. by the Polish government, where they were often denied food and medicine; some of them died from starvation, disease or suicide. The victims included not only soldiers and officers but also priests, lawyers and doctors who had supported the Ukrainian cause.Myroslav Shkandrij. (2015) Ukrainian Nationalism: Politics, Ideology, and Literature, 1929-1956. New Haven: Yale University Press pg. 19 Cited passage states \\"After the war, in 1920-1921, Polish concentration camps held over one hundred thousand people. In many cases prisoners were denied food and medical attention. Some starved; others died of disease or committed suicide. Among the interned were Jews and others of other nationalities who supported Ukrainian independence, and Jews figured among the witnesses who described the murder and abuse.\\" The death toll at these camps from diseases was estimated at 20,000 people (during the war, the Ukrainian government had interred 25,000 Poles).Jochen B√∂hler. (2019). Civil War in Central Europe, 1918-1921: The Reconstruction of Poland. Oxford University Press, pg. 81 \\"100,000 Ukrainians were subsequently interred in the camps of the ultimately victorious Polish Army. One fifth of them fell to infectious diseases.\\" From the outset the Polish government adopted the policy of assimilation and repression of the Ukrainian minority in these lands. Many Ukrainian organizations continued close contact with the Weimar Republic, later Nazi Germany, while others kept in contact with the new Soviet government to the east. The use of the Ukrainian language was banned in government agencies in 1924 and support was steadily withdrawn from Ukrainian schools. Polish-Ukrainian relations deteriorated during the Great Depression, which led to much economic disruption, felt particularly hard in the rural areas. In this atmosphere radical Ukrainian nationalists propagating active resistance to Polish domination found a ready response from Ukrainian youth. In July 1930, activists of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) began sabotage actions, during which warehouses and cereal fields owned by Poles were burned, Polish homes were destroyed, bridges were blown up, state institutions, rail lines and telephone connections were damaged. The organizer of the action was Yevhen Konovalets. Financing was provided and weaponry was illegally smuggled with German support. The main reason behind the sabotage campaign was the decision of the mainstream Ukrainian parties to participate in the Polish political system, coupled with J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's policy of toleration, which threatened the OUN's position in Ukrainian society. The organization reacted by adopting a tactic designed to radicalize Ukrainian public opinion and block any form of compromise with Polish authorities. The OUN used terrorism and sabotage in order to force the Polish government into reprisals so fierce that they would cause the more moderate Ukrainian groups ready to negotiate with the Polish state to lose support. OUN directed its violence not only against the Poles, but also against all those Ukrainians who wished for a peaceful settlement of the Polish - Ukrainian conflict. In the course of time, local Ukrainians, many of whom saw the Poles as occupiers of their land, joined the action. Offices of the Polish paramilitary organization Strzelec were burned, as were the stands of the popular trade fairs in Lw√≥w (Lviv). Government offices and mail trucks were attacked. This situation lasted until September, with some sporadic incidents taking place as late as November. The terror action was limited to Galicia, and did not take place in Volhynia. In response, Polish authorities decided to pacify the turbulent province. The decision to carry out the action was made by Marshall J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski in his capacity as Prime Minister of the Second Polish Republic. Recognizing that terrorist actions carried out by the OUN did not amount to an insurrection, Pi≈Çsudski ordered a police action, rather than a military one, and deputized the Minister of Interior, Felicjan S≈Çawoj-Sk≈Çadkowski with its organization. S≈Çawoj-Sk≈Çadkowski in turn ordered regional police commanders to prepare for it in the Lw√≥w Voivodeship, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w Voivodeship and Tarnopol Voivodeship. The commander of the planned action was Lw√≥w Voivodeship's chief of police, Czes≈Çaw Grabowski. Before the action commenced, around 130 Ukrainian activists, including a few dozen former Sejm (Polish parliament) deputies were arrested. The action itself began on 14 September 1930, in several villages of Lw√≥w Voivodeship, where the cavalry unit of 14th Regiment of Jaz≈Çowiecki U≈Çans was directed, even though the detailed plan for the action was not established until 18 September. Forces involved From 20 to 29 September, 17 companies of police (60 policemen each) were used. Of these, 9 came from the police academy in Mosty Wielkie (Velyki Mosty), 3 from Lw√≥w Voivodeship, 2.5 from Stanis≈Çaw√≥w Voivodeship, 2.5 from Tarnopol Voivodeship (a total of 1041 policemen and officers). The main operations with the participation of military units took place in the first half of October. Overall, the action affected: *Lw√≥w Voivodeship: police action - 206 places in 9 different counties, military action - 78 places in 8 different counties. *Stanis≈Çaw√≥w Voivodeship: police action - 56 places in 2 counties, military action - 33 places in one county *Tarnopol Voivodeship - police action - 63 places in 4 counties, military action - 57 places in 5 counties. Or in total 494 villages. Timothy Snyder and other sources give the figure of 1000 policemen used in the operation, affecting 450 villages. Nature of the action The operation was carried out in three stages. First, a basic edict was issued authorizing a particular action. Second, police units were brought in. Third units of the regular army carried out \\"operational maneuvers\\". The pacification involved the search of private homes as well as buildings in which Ukrainian organizations (including the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church) were based. During the search, the buildings, belongings, and property of Ukrainians was destroyed and the inhabitants often beaten and arrested. Several Ukrainian schools (in Rohat, Drohobycz, Lw√≥w, Tarnopol and Stanis≈Çaw√≥w) were closed and the Ukrainian Youth Scout organization Plast was delegalized. On 10 September, five deputies of Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance were arrested. The pacification was carried out by first surrounding a village with police units, then calling out the village elder or an administrator of the village. He in turn was informed about the purpose of the operation, and was ordered to give up any weapons or explosives hidden in the village. All villagers were to remain in their houses. Subsequently, the houses of those suspected of cooperation with Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists were searched, which included the tearing up of floors and ceilings. During the course of the search the furniture and property inside the houses were often destroyed. Policemen found about 100 kilograms of explosives and weapons (1287 rifles, 566 revolvers, 31 grenades). Also, during the searches, physical force was used and many people were beaten. According to Polish historian W≈Çadys≈Çaw Pob√≥g-Malinowski, there were no fatalities, while, according to Ukrainian historian Petro Mirchuk, 35 Ukrainian civilians died during the pacification. Stephan Horak estimates the number of victims at 7. Additional punishments included levying special \\"contributions\\" on the villages and stationing regiments of cavalry in the village, which had to be fed and quartered by the villages. A committee of the League of Nations in its response to Ukrainian-Nationalists protest regarding the \\"pacification\\" action, while not approving the methods used, stated that it was the Ukrainian extremists themselves who were to be blame for consciously inviting this response by their sabotage activities and maintained that it was not governmental policy of persecution of the Ukrainian people. Effects of the action One of the unintended consequences of the action, from the point of view of Polish authorities, was that previously allegedly \\"moderately oriented\\" Ukrainians became radicalized, and even those who had previously felt loyalty to the Polish state began supporting separation. The OUN continued its terroristic activities, and engaged in numerous assassinations. Some of those murdered by the OUN after the Pacification included Tadeusz Ho≈Ç√≥wko, a Polish promoter of Ukrainian/Polish compromise, Emilian Czechowski, Lwow's Polish police commissioner, Alexei Mailov, a Soviet consular official killed in retaliation for the Holodomor, and most notably Bronis≈Çaw Pieracki, the Polish interior minister. The OUN also killed moderate Ukrainian figures such as the respected teacher (and former officer of the Ukrainian Galician Army of the West Ukrainian People's Republic) Ivan Babij.Alexander Motyl.

San Diego State University Library and Information Access. 2009 (retrieved 2 August 2009) Leona Williams currently serves as Tribal Chairperson.Pinoleville Pomo Nation Contact Page. Pinoleville Tribal Government. (retrieved 2 August 2009) History The Pinoleville Pomo Nation is a small band of the greater Pomo Tribe of Northern California. The Pinoleville Pomo Nation is originally from Potter Valley, California, located eighteen miles (29 km) north-northeast of Ukiah, California where the Pinoleville Pomo Nation currently resides. Prior to the arrival of the European colonizers, there were three main villages in Potter Valley called Pomo, Sedam (or Tse tum) and Canel (or Shanel, Sanel), and several smaller villages and camps. These villages remained connected and cooperative with each other through marriage, and ceremonies. They were governed by councilmen called tca ka-li in Northern Pomo, also sometimes known as captains. The arrival of the Spanish, Russians, and fur traders in the early 1800s was devastating for Native Californians and their way of life. In the first half of the century, the Pomos suffered from forced removal, disease and servitude from the settlers. This domination continued into the second half of the 17th century with the discovery of gold in California. By 1850 thousands of Europeans had arrived in northern California hoping to strike rich. Treaties were proposed to guarantee land for most California Natives, including the Pomos, but the treaties never reached ratification. Thus the California government declared that all land that was not claimed was public land, meaning the land the Pomos and many of Native Californians lived on was allowed to be settled on by non-Native peoples. The Pomos were forced off their land as the new settlers began using the land for ranching. The Pomos were left to settle on non-fertile lands in the periphery of the land they once lived on and struggled to find enough food to survive.  Important Events =Bloody Run - 1871= The majority of the remaining Pomos living in Potter Valley were brutally forced by the militia to leave Potter Valley and walk to Round Valley Reservation, 65 miles north of Ukiah. This event is called ‚ÄúBa-lay-Ba-lin‚Äù or ‚ÄúBloody Run‚Äù because the Eel River ran red with the blood of the deceased for three days. This history is not widely cited, but has been recounted by Pinoleville Pomo Nation members whose ancestors experienced this atrocity. One member recounted the Bloody Run, stating, ‚Äúthe white men herded all the Indians like cattle, and if you were too slow you were shot from behind and thrown in the river.‚Äù There were many young and elderly people who were unable to keep up and thus killed. Those who were not murdered were forced to walk to Round Valley Reservation. = Purchasing of Pinoleville - 1878-1893 = In 1878, a large group of Potter Valley Pomos left the Round Valley Reservation and purchased 51 acres of land on the north side of Ukiah. This land was known as ke-buk ke-bul, but soon was known as Pinoleville. In 1893 the Pinoleville captains joined with other Northern Pomo captains and traded their land at $10 for 100 acres between Ackerman Creek (ya-mo-bida ‚Äì wind hole creek), and Orr springs Road. This is where the Pinoleville Pomo people settled. The captains allowed displaced families and tribelets to live in Pinoleville. = Pinoleville Rancheria -1905-1966 = In 1905, a Bureau of Indian Affairs survey stated the land was overcrowded, and through the Homeless, Landless Indian Act, a Rancheria was purchased next to the original piece of land in 1911. This land came to be called the Pinoleville Rancheria. The status of the Pinoleville Rancheria changed in 1958 when the US government began to implement integration policies throughout the United States. In 1966 the Pinoleville Rancheria was terminated. =Tillie Hardwick v. US - 1983= Despite this, in 1983 Pinoleville became a part of Tillie Hardwick v. US, a class action suit against the federal government for the termination of Indian Rancherias. Tillie Hardwick was successful and seventeen tribes which were formally terminated won formal recognition from the US government. =Federal recognition of Pinoleville Pomo Nation - 2005-2006= On June 26, 2005 Pinoleville Pomo Nation adopted their own constitution and elected seven officials to serve as the tribal council with four year terms. In 2006, Pinoleville Pomo Nation signed a Title IV compact with the US government and was recognized as a Self-Governance Tribe. = Culture = Housing  Winter shelters (tca) were hemispherical, with floors sunken a foot or so into the ground and walls woven of willow, thatched with thick grass, tules, or willow. These might house anywhere from one to five families. They also built small sweat houses (tca-ne), which also served as meeting places or warm winter quarters for men. The main villages had large meeting houses, or roundhouses, some of which could hold several hundred people for ceremonies and dances. In the summer camps, a brush shelter sufficed. Nomadic Food Collection Rather than an agricultural tribe, the Pomo were nomadic people who moved throughout Northern California depending on the season. They moved with the seasons, gathering what they needed where it was abundant. In spring, they walked to the coast to collect seaweed, abalone and shellfish. These were dried and brought back to be stored for winter. Hunting of small game, using ingenious traps, spears, or arrows, was done throughout the year. The most important staple food of the Pomo people was acorns, gathered in the fall and carefully stored for winter. Fish, deer and elk meat were also dried for winter stores.  Baskets  The Pomo people excelled in making baskets. Learn more about the Pomo's baskets on the main Pomo Wikipedia page. =Tribal services and projects= Pinoleville Pomo Nation currently operates a housing program to support low income residents, and encourage the construction of sustainable housing through a partnership with the housing committee and environmental department. Thus far, two houses constructed by the Pinoleville Pomo Nation with guidance by architects and engineers from UC Berkeley have been completed. Through their environmental department the Pinoleville Pomo Nation has created a horticultural program, which focuses on tribal youth ‚Äî educating them about plants, to improve self-esteem and provide skills. These skills and knowledge is also aimed to improve diets and the local environment. In addition to this, Pinole Nation Gardens include a greenhouse, orchards, two gardens, and native plant restoration areas which are located in Ukiah.Pinoleville Pomo Nation: Horticultural Initiative.

It was composed in either 1707 or 1708, which makes it one of Bach's earliest cantatas. Some sources suggest that it could be his earliest surviving work in this form, but current thinking is that there are one or two earlier examples. The cantata was commissioned by the minister of one of the churches in M√ºhlhausen, the city where Bach worked at the time. It was possibly written for a special occasion. The text is based on Luther's German version of Psalm 130 and also incorporates the words of a chorale. Bach's music integrates melodies from the chorale into larger structures. Bach also shows his interest in counterpoint, something which was characteristic of him throughout his career.  History and words  A note on the autograph score of the cantata indicates that the work was commissioned by Georg Christian Eilmar, minister of the Marienkirche (St. Mary's church) in M√ºhlhausen. This allows the work to be dated to 1707‚Äì08, which is the period when Bach was living in M√ºhlhausen. Bach was employed as organist at the city's other main church, Divi Blasii,. He was also involved to some extent with performances at the Marienkirche, where civic ceremonies were held. One service there which Bach would have attended was that for the city council's inauguration in 1708 during which his cantata Gott ist mein Konig, BWV 71 had its premiere. He may have had a closer personal relationship with Eilmar than with the minister of his own church. Eilmar was godfather to his daughter Catharina Dorothea (born 1708). has been described as possibly Bach's first surviving cantata. For it to be the first, it has to be assumed not only that it predates other cantatas written in M√ºhlhausen (we know that he wrote at least one other there), but also that there is not a surviving cantata from his previous post at Arnstadt. It seems likely that Bach was composing choral music at Arnstadt. Although Bach was only 22 when he took up the appointment at M√ºhlhausen, the performance of a work of his own composition appears to have been part of the selection process. Recent scholarship suggests that another surviving cantata Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150 could have been composed at Arnstadt. The libretto is based on Psalm 130, one of the penitential psalms. The incipit of the psalm, \\"Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir\\", gives the cantata its name. Originally a Hebrew text, the incipit has variants in translation. While is rendered \\"Out of the depths...\\" in the English King James version, a closer translation of the German text used by Bach would be \\"deep\\" rather than \\"depths\\". The anonymous librettist, possibly Eilmar, includes in two of the movements verses from \\"\\", a Lutheran hymn by Bartholom√§us Ringwaldt. The hymn is also penitential. Bach later used it as the basis for the cantata , where the words form a counterpart to the tax collector's prayer in the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican, the gospel reading for the eleventh Sunday after Trinity. In his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, Sir John Eliot Gardiner performed and recorded the work with cantatas for the Fifth Sunday after Trinity,This was partly for a practical reason, the paucity of surviving cantatas for that particular Sunday. See Cantatafinder ‚Äì search tool dedicated to the live recordings made during the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage under the SDG label but it is not known for sure when in the liturgical year Bach performed it, and there has been speculation that it was written for a special occasion. (information based on D√ºrr, Die Kantaten and the Oxford Composer Companion: J.S.Bach) = Publication = Bach's ability as a composer was recognised by the city council of Muhlhausen who paid for the printing of the cantata Gott ist mein Konig, BWV 71.Bach, Johann Sebastian: Gl√ºckw√ºnschende Kirchen Motetto, als bey solennen Gottesdienste in ... M√ºhlhausen: Tobias David Br√ºckner, 1708 (D-B Mus. 11495: original print at Berlin State Library) They may also have arranged the publication of a later cantata now lost. None of the other cantatas was published in the composer's lifetime. was first published in 1881 as part of the Bach-Gesellschaft- Ausgabe, the first complete edition of Bach's works. The editor was Wilhelm Rust, who edited many volumes for the Bach-Gesellschaft. At the time of publication of this volume, he held the position of Thomaskantor in Leipzig.  Scoring and structure = Singers = Bach scored the work for tenor and bass soloists and a four-part choir. Bach gives his soloists an arioso and an aria. As in other early cantatas, there are no recitatives. (Bach later came more under the influence of Italian music, combining recitatives and arias). Bach did not give a direct indication of how many singers he envisaged in the choir. The cantata can be performed with only four singers, as in the recording by Joshua Rifkin, who is well known in the world of Bach performance for his \\"one voice to a part\\" approach. However, most recordings feature a choir with multiple voices to a part. Another choice to be made is whether to use women singers: Bach's original singers were probably all male. Most recordings of the cantata, however, feature mixed choirs: an exception is the version conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, which deploys boys' voices as the top lines of the choir.Recorded in 1981, this version is part of a complete set of the cantatas, a joint project with Gustav Leonhardt, which mainly uses male voices. = Instruments = The singers are accompanied by an instrumental group consisting of oboe, bassoon, violin, two violas and basso continuo. As in the case of the singers, the question arises as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, suggesting that there may well have been only one of each. Ton Koopman, for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide accompaniment, filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The bassoon sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line. = Musical forms = Portrait of the young Bach (disputed) Bach used some musical forms which reappear in later cantatas. For example, two of the choral movements have a fugue, a style of composition in which Bach excelled. Also, the two movements for soloists are developed as a type of chorale fantasia with the soloist singing the psalm text and an upper voice singing the chorale in long notes as a cantus firmus. Craig Smith called the chorale settings \\"a window on the future\\". However, he criticised the structure of the cantata, saying that it offers evidence that at this stage in his career the composer had difficulty with large forms. On the other hand, the musicologist Julian Mincham regards the piece as being different from later cantatas rather than inferior to them. = Structure and scoring = Bach structured the cantata in five movements, three choral movements interspersed by an arioso and an aria. In both solo movements, a chorale stanza sung simultaneously by the soprano intensifies the Psalm text. He scored it for two soloist (tenor and bass), a four-part choir, and a small Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe (Ob), bassoon (Fg), violin (Vl), two violas (Va), and basso continuo. In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe). The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol 11px for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.

The Quinault Treaty continued Isaac Stevens policy of consolidating tribes, often requiring tribes to move far from their homeland to a reservation to be occupied by several unrelated tribes. While not taking this policy as far as the Treaty of Point No Point did, the Quinault Treaty resulted in the establishment of the Quinault Reservation in the Quinault homeland but required the Quileute and Hoh to move there, although few did. Negotiations The treaty negotiations were conducted in Chinook Jargon, which, according to Paul Prucha, was \\"a lingua franca along the Pacific Northwest coast but hardly an effective tool for sensitive negotiations, for it had a vocabulary of only about 500 words, and a single word might be used to translate a number of different English words.\\" The final treaty contained 13 articles. The first described the land being ceded to the United States, which was defined as bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west, the southern boundary of the recent Makah cession to the north, which ran east to \\"the middle of the coast range of mountains\\" (meaning the Olympic Mountains). The eastern cession boundary ran south \\"with said range\\" (the Olympics) to the ridge dividing the drainage basins of the Chehalis River and the Quinault River. From there the line ran west along the watershed ridge to the Pacific Ocean. This somewhat vague definition was further confused by the way the Makah cession boundary had been defined as extending south to the lands occupied by the Quileute. This circular definition, along with the unclear phrases about where the line ran through the Olympics, resulted in confusion and legal problems which continue to the present day.Interpretation of the Indian Ceded Land Treaties , Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife The second article of the treaty described how the reservation would be established and that the tribes would be required to move there. Article three promised the tribes the right of fishing \\"in all usual and accustomed grounds and stations\\". Hunting, gathering, and the pasturing of horses were also protected with certain provision. In article four the United States promised to pay $25,000 for the land cession, to be paid over a number of years. Article five provides an additional $2,500 to enable tribes to remove and settle upon the reservation. Article six described how the president could any future time and \\"as he deems fit\\" make a new reservation elsewhere and requires the tribes to move there, or require the tribes to be consolidated with other tribes on another reservation, with all federal annuities also consolidated. The president could also cause the reservation to be subdivided into lots and assigned to individuals and families. Articles seven and nine dealt with the prohibition of alcohol and debts. Article eight required the tribes to \\"acknowledge their dependence on the United States\\", and briefly outlined how crimes would be dealt with. In article ten the United States promised to establish and support for 20 years an agricultural and industrial school, free to the children of the tribes and located at the territorial central Puget Sound agency. A physician was also to be provided, also at the central agency. Article eleven required the tribes to free any slaves they held. Article thirteen forbid the tribes from trading \\"at Vancouver's Island or elsewhere outside the dominion of the United States\\", nor to allow \\"foreign Indians\\" to live in the reservation. The last article said that the terms of the treaty would take effect upon ratification by the President and the Senate. After the treaty Most of the Quileute and Hoh refused to move to the Quinault Reservation once it was established. Both received small reservations of their own. The Hoh Reservation was established by President Grover Cleveland by Executive Order on 11 September 1893. The reservation is only , but includes about a mile of the Pacific coastline south of the mouth of the Hoh River. Interpretation In mapping Indian land cession the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife had to make some guesses and assumptions about the cession boundaries. The line between the Quinault and Makah cession was assumed to extend from current day Cape Alava due east to a watershed divide separating streams flowing north to the Strait of Juan de Fuca and streams flowing to the Pacific. The phrases \\"to the middle of the coast range of mountains\\" and \\"to the summit of the coast-range of mountains\\" were assumed to mean the dividing crest of the Olympic Mountains separating the Pacific, Juan de Fuca, and Hood Canal drainage basins. The phrase \\"thence southerly with said range of mountains to their intersection with the dividing ridge between the Chehalis and Quiniatl [sic] Rivers; thence westerly with said ridge to the Pacific coast\\" required further assumptions. The Fish and Wildlife project assumed the \\"southerly\\" line was to follow the main drainage divide between the Pacific and Hood Canal. This interpretation of the treaty is just one of many possible and holds no legal weight. The Fish and Wildlife Department writes, \\"These boundaries are clearly the product of much conjecture and assumption.\\" See also * List of treaties ReferencesExternal links * Treaty with the Quinaielt, etc., 1855, original treaty text (and spellings) and images, Government Printing Office, 1904.

Sanath Kumar. Its stars Jaggesh and Yagna Shetty in the lead roles. Tabla Nani and V. Manohar appear in supporting in roles. At the 2009‚Äì10 Karnataka State Film Awards, Guruprasad won the award for Best Screenplay. At the 57th Filmfare Awards South, the film won two awards ‚Äì Best Director (Guruprasad) and Special Jury Award (Yagna Shetty). Plot This film is about the life and times of a lazy and jobless middle aged man named Manjunatha (\\"Manja\\") who considers his life as an eventual existence rather than a practical, deserving and a capable one. His laziness is portrayed in the film as not a quality but as an ethic imbibed within his general thoughts and notions of the everyday world that surrounds him. Through his formative years his thinking becomes pragmatic in considering that livelihood can always be sought through alternate sources rather than being a puppet to how the world goes about through linear methods of gaining success and money. The other essentially important character in the film is a visually impaired person named Naani (played by Tabla Naani). Although being born blind, he wishes to be a film director. Naani's most positive aspect of the role is that he does not believe that his physical disability could stop him from achieving what he dreams, that is to be a film maker. The film is structured around the lengthy conversation, which happen in a captive lodge room, between Manja and Naani where each depict their ideologies and experiences and co-relate their thoughts. Being a Jaggesh film, the film is no where short in containing blatant satirical humour and constant metaphors. The characters of Manja and Naani form contrasting personalities - Manja being an unmotivated, lazy and irresponsible guy and Naani being optimistic and ambitious. Naani happens to meet Manja in a very interesting scenario. Even with their contrasting personalities, Manja and Naani get along together pretty well. The other important, yet minimally portrayed, role is of Manja's wife Gowri (played by Yagna Shetty). Manja admittedly marries Gowri in the fact that he was getting a small house as a dowry. Gowri struggles to save her relationship while Manja is doused into the casual habits of alcohol, his influential \\"circle\\" of friends, betting, occasional petty thieving at random jobs, inability to sustain decent jobs, wife-bitching and other habits including schemes that eventually thicken the gap between living a moral and a meaningful life and being an incapable disloyal husband. However Gowri's character is portrayed to be of a devout woman who honours the capacity of developing a more healthy family hood through her husband changing his ways some day or the other. But days and years go on and Manja's lifestyle remains unchanged much to the chagrin of Gowri. The conversation now continues shifting from the lodge to Manja's home itself. After celebrating their freedom from the lodge with alcoholism that night they find themselves again captive within the house due to the help of the local inspector who assists Gowri to tackle Manja's unyielding ways. Naani then talks about the plot of his film, which was seemingly ignored by the producer with whom he had placed his trust upon (and for the reason with which he ended up being captive in the lodge). Manja, hearing of the simple story of Dr. Rajkumar's pledged eyes and how they were now seeing a world through another person, is taken aback and applauds Naani for such a heartwarming plot and how the -Annavru-'s fans would welcome such a movie. He motivates Naani with all success if Naani ever made the film by taking out his mother's prized 50 rupee note from the cupboard and giving it to Naani. He tells Naani that it was considered as a luck charm to any person that received it. He also happens to find a note in the cupboard that Gowri leaves behind (after her inability to tell him personally that night due to his inebriated state) to Manja conveying that she was now carrying and that he would soon become a father. Manja's personality suddenly defines a change after reading the news. He is unable to express his joy, apart from sharing it with Naani, at that moment being locked in his home. He tries calling Gowri but he doesn't get her on-line. In the midst of all this there concocts a life turning situation for Manja at that moment. His wife returns home struck in pain. Gowri had killed the developing child in her womb due to the burdensome worry which she concluded that she wasn't in a state to be able to maintain and grow a child while having such a lackluster and incapable husband. She perceived that it was best for the child to not come to life and face a deteriorated lifestyle. Naani leaves the house expressing his ill-timed presence in the development of such an event. Manja is clipped between a moment of where he faced fresh joy like he had not known for a long long time where he believed that the child, who would be his Lakshmi (the Goddess of wealth), would change his life for the better and to another moment that his 'Lakshmi' would not be happening. In his state of hopelessness he threatens Gowri as to what rights she held to kill his child. Gowri is throbbing in pain to be able to reply to his questions. In this delusion of Manja, Lakshmi -the unborn child, appears to him and speaks to him as to how ill-fated she would have been to have been born as a daughter to such a father. Lakshmi says that Gowri, her mother, did not kill her and that Manja, her father, killed her and suggests to him that he could celebrate this occasion with his friends by drinking along with them. Manja's remorse knows no bounds. He reflects back Lakshmi's words to Gowri and says to his wife that neither his own parents or his own wife or any of his gurus could ever be a guru to him, but the unborn dead child which will never happen in his existence was his ultimate guru to his final immediate realization of the value of life.

Biography He was born on March 4, 1852 in Columbus, Georgia. He was appointed Chief Justice of Samoa c.1897, where the English, Germans and Americans were sharing political influence under a tripartite agreement. He was soon forced to adjudicate between rival local claimants to the kingship of Samoa, ruling on a legal technicality in favour of Chief Tanu. A civil war ensued, which had to put down by British naval intervention, severely worsening relations between England and Germany, who had favoured the other claimant. Chambers was eventually pressured into resigning his post c.1900. In March 1913, he was appointed Commissioner of the United States Board of Mediation and Conciliation. He died in 1933 and was buried in Monocacy Cemetery, Beallsville, Maryland. He had married Laura Ligon Clopton and had several children.

Taking Thai respondent Sarawut Chutiwongpeti‚Äôs suggestion for the ‚ÄòDream Museum‚Äô to be ‚ÄòLike 7-Eleven‚Äô, AAA established the ‚ÄòDream Museum Convenience Store‚Äô at ART HK 09. Participants were asked to bring images or objects to AAA‚Äôs booth to contribute to the ‚Äòcollection‚Äô. On-site workshops with artists, curators, designers, and architects facilitated the discussion. *Backroom Conversations (annually since 2008): As the official educational partner of ART HK (Hong Kong International Art Fair), AAA presents an annual series of panel discussions and screenings with leading experts and practitioners in the field that touch on prevalent issues and offer a first-hand look into the contemporary art world today. Topics have included ‚ÄòReinvesting in Contemporary Chinese Art‚Äô; ‚ÄòHeritage Sites: the Answer to Hong Kong‚Äôs Arts Needs?‚Äô; ‚ÄòArtist as Activist, Art as Catalyst‚Äô; and ‚ÄòIn the Aftermath of the White Cube: Museums and Other Spaces‚Äô. Speakers have included Ron Arad, Sabine Breitwieser, Johnson Chang, David Elliott, Yuko Hasegawa, Manray Hsu, Hu Fang, Eungie Joo, Vasif Kortun, Barbara London, Charles Merewether, Frances Morris, Alexandra Munroe, Martha Rosler, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Sheena Wagstaff, Ada Wong, Wong Hoy Cheong, Pauline Yao, and Daniela Zyman, among others. Originally named Hong Kong Conversations, the series was renamed in 2009. *Pool of Possibilities: Mapping Currents of the 3rd Guangzhou Triennial (2008): In collaboration with the 3rd Guangzhou Triennial, this project maps the network of connections between artists‚Äô practices in the form of an online database that linked artists from across the world through a variety of mediums and concepts. *The Anxious Century: Discourses Waiting To Be Born: a Seminar on Art Criticism (2008): This two-day seminar was jointly presented by AAA, NuqtaArt, a Karachi-based art publication, and the Goethe-Institut in Karachi. It brought together cultural workers, critics, and scholars from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Germany, and India to probe the birth of new discourse within South Asian art in the twenty-first century, and explored the possible reclamation of old dialogues within South Asian art through the lens of post- colonialism. AAA hosted a panel discussion that looked at the challenge of building art archives with collective solutions and shared expertise. *Shifting Sites: Cultural Desire and the Museum (2008): AAA and The Department of Cultural and Religious Studies at The Chinese University of Hong Kong invited key individuals and institutions to address relevant issues and share their insights and experiences on the roles of museums. The ‚ÄòShifting Sites‚Äô conference included keynote speeches, presentations, reports, and group discussions that raised awareness about current debates surrounding contemporary museum practices in Asia. *Action Script ‚ÄìSymposium on Performance Art Practice and Documentation in Asia (2010): This five-day symposium, co-presented with the Centre for Community Cultural Development, brought internationally respected performance artists, archivists, and researchers together in Hong Kong to consider the practice of performance art in Asia and to critically discuss the challenges associated with archiving performance work or ‚Äòlive art‚Äô. *From Jean-Paul Sartre to Teresa Teng: Contemporary Cantonese Art in the 1980s (2010): Drawn from primary research, rare film footage, and 14 interviews with artists, curators, and historians active in the Guangdong region during the 1980s collected as part of the research for the film From Jean-Paul Sartre to Teresa Teng: Contemporary Cantonese Art in the 1980s. *Materials of the Future: Documenting Contemporary Chinese Art from 1980‚Äì1990 (2010): In 2006, AAA began locating, collecting, and preserving a large body of important material from the 1980s, a period in China‚Äôs art history that was in danger of being lost. At the same time, AAA conducted a series of in-depth professional interviews with artists, critics, and curators of the 1980s in an attempt to record this period of contemporary Chinese art. With more than 70,000 digital documents, AAA now maintains the world‚Äôs largest and most systematically organized archive of documentary material about Chinese art made during the 1980s.

Armed with raptorial forelegs, ambush bugs routinely capture prey ten or more times their own size. They form a subgroup within the assassin bugs. Description Phymata pennsylvanica Phymata sp. eggs Ambush bug nymph Phymatinae are long. In Phymata, the scutellum is triangular and shorter than the pronotum. In Macrocephalus, the scutellum is narrow and rounded and extends to the tip of the abdomen. Phymatinae normally have a large fore femur and clubbed antennae. The forewing membranes sometimes lack distinct cells. The antennae have four segments. There are two ocelli. The beak has three segments. The tarsi also have three segments. The rear half of the abdomen expands beyond the edges of the wings. Etymology The name Phymatinae is derived from the Greek phymata meaning \\"swollen\\", which presumably refers to the enlarged abdomen and femora.Phyma at dictionary.com. Taxonomy The subfamily Phymatinae was often given family-level status and this classification is still used in some textbooks. Based on cladistic analyses, however, ambush bugs (Phymatinae) are part of the family Reduviidae (assassin bugs). They are a sister group of the Holoptilinae.

Chapdelaine won an upset victory in a February 1949 by-election in Nicolet‚ÄîYamaska - the first francophone riding to be won in Quebec since the Conservative Party relaunched itself as the Progressive Conservatives in 1942. While in the previous election, the Progressive Conservative candidate received only 944 votes, Chapdelaine received 8,382 votes, just over 49% of the total vote and almost 300 votes more than his rival, Liberal Paul Trahan. The victory, in a riding that had not voted Tory since 1911, was seen as a major breakthrough for the Progressive Conservatives and for its new leader George A. Drew, one which made much more likely a Tory victory in the next federal election.\\"Chapdelaine beats Trahan in keen fight\\", Globe and Mail, February 8, 1949\\"See 50-50 Chance of PC Government, May Delay Election\\", Globe and Mail, February 8, 1949 He was a supporter of the Union Nationale provincially and credited his victory to the voter support for the principle of an autonomous province opposed to the centralization of federal powers - a policy supported by both the UN and the Tories.\\"PC Wins Quebec Seat, Beats Liberal by 296\\", Globe and Mail, February 8, 1949 Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent blamed Chapdelaine's victory on the presence of a third candidate, an Independent Liberal, who they argued split the Liberal vote.\\"Party marching, Drew reflects\\", Globe and Mail, February 8, 1949 The Liberals subsequently claimed that Chapdelaine had run on isolationist and Quebec nationalist policies critical of the government's involvement in World War II\\"Liberal Claim Nicolet Fought on Isolationism\\", Globe and Mail, March 2, 1949 and that his true allegiance was not to Drew but to Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis.\\"Meet Renaud Chapdelaine, Drew's Quebec Missionary\\", Toronto Daily Star, May 26, 1949 In March 1949, Chapdelaine and Georges Heon, an Independent Conservative MP who had recently joined the Progressive Conservative caucus, signed a joint statement calling for improving the rights of Franco-Ontarians in regards to French language Separate Schools in Ontario.

It was established in 1981 by Garrie and Kitty Roman, and by 1997 expanded to 39 stores with 450,000 members. It also had stores in Taiwan, with further plans to expand in the Asian region. During the Asian Economic Crisis the company suffered, and went into receivership in 1998. It was later bought out by American video-chain Blockbuster. History KPS Video Express originally started in 1981 as a kiosk at the back of a Nathan Road electrical shop. Husband and wife Garrie and Kitty Roman built up a selection of Western and Chinese films on VHS tape which would be rented out for $15 Hong Kong dollars. The business was successful, and by 1982 Kam Production Studios, named after Kam Kui International Holdings chairman K. K. Leung, backed the company and it became KPS Video Network, originally opening seven kiosks. It was renamed KPS Retail Stores Ltd in 1987. By 1992, KPS also offered LaserDiscs for sale and rent in addition to VHS tapes, as well as computer software, audio CDs and CD-ROM drives. A test store was opened in Causeway Bay in the same year in order to experiment with the merging of these products under one roof. It was successful, and was subsequently followed in 1994 by a superstore at Chong Hing Square at 601 Nathan Road, Mongkok, which occupied . It offered 73,000 CDs in stock and 17,000 titles for rent. Among these titles, there were over 12,500 laser discs for sale and rent while 6,000 VHS tapes were for sale and 37,000 were available for rent. In 1994, KPS first introduced camera and magnetic theft-detection systems in its megastores. It also used a computer-based procurement system to accurately forecast demand, as well as keep track of current stock and trends. By 1995, local newspapers reported plans for expansion beyond Hong Kong to locations in other Asian countries. By this time, KPS owned 35% of the Hong Kong video-rental market, had a customer base of 250,000 and was earning $36 million Hong Kong dollars. KPS announced that it had teamed up with ChinaVest, an American direct- investment company to expand into Taiwan. ChinaVest pumped $26 million US dollars into the venture. Initial plans were to launch 100 stores in Taiwan within three years, with megastores between 360 and 1,350 square meters offering videos on tape and laserdiscs for sale and rent, as well as music products and computer software. It also planned to expand to South Korea and open 500 stores, 12 stores in Singapore and 55 stores in Malaysia, and plans for stores in Thailand. In 1996 turnover hit US$100 million (HK$774 million) and KPS won the DHL/South China Morning Post Enterprise Award that year. In the same year, Garrie Roman sold his stake, but remained on the board and involved in operations. By 1997, KPS had 39 stores in Hong Kong and 5 megastores in Taiwan, with plans to continue expanding giving 100 stores in Hong Kong within two years, and 30 in Taiwan by the end of 1997. By that time, it had a customer base of 450,000 members in Hong Kong and employed around 1,000 people. Long-term plans included expanding to 1,050 stores in the region by 2005. Decline and collapse By 1997, the company suffered mounting financial problems, brought on by a number of factors. Unauthorized copying of CDs on a commercial scale contributed to their fall, as it is estimated that legitimate retailers lost an estimated $900 million Hong Kong Dollars to counterfeiters in 1998. The Asian Economic Crisis was also a major factor, causing consumers to spend less. KPS lost an estimated $12 million Hong Kong dollars by the end of 1997. Parallel imports of films intended for overseas markets were banned when the Copyright Ordinance became law on 1 July 1997, cutting product availability by 30 per cent. At the same time, the company's rapid but undisciplined expansion put a strain on finances, as new stores were being opened without proper analysis of their location or feasibility. Stores were opened within walking distance of one another, while the money to fund the expansion came from the sales of pre-paid coupons. Members were given special deals to purchase packs for coupons which were then used for video rentals. In May 1998, rumours that KPS was close to collapse circulated on the internet, triggering panic rentals and the lack of confidence caused coupon sales to plunge. The collapse of Maria Bakery, who were unable to fulfil their pre-paid coupon commitments, also led consumers to lose faith in the coupon system. On 23 June 1998, KPS announced a Coupon Burn campaign, in which customers were given until 1 August 1998 to redeem coupons for rentals or convert them for purchases, in which two coupons would equal to $25 HK dollars on purchases over $100 Hong Kong dollars. For rentals, the top 150 titles were excluded from the offer. Alternatively, five coupons could be spent to buy a used tape, or 10 coupons to buy a second-hand LaserDisc. Customers also received a blank video tape for every 18 coupon rentals and promised a grace period of up to four months for those with large numbers of coupons. From that point on, a cash-only system would be introduced in which video rentals would cost between $20 to $25 Hong Kong dollars, while members would receive a 20% discount off that price. The price was still higher than the average price for a coupon. Customers complained to the Consumer Council because of the change of terms and conditions in the coupons, while several cases were brought to the Small Claims Tribunal to claim a refund on unused coupons. KPS attempted to settle out-of-court with offers to extend the coupon validity, but the offer was rejected by claimants. The four claimants won their lawsuit on 23 October 1998, and KPS was forced to refund the coupons, opening possible floodgates for further claims. KPS blamed the ruling for sealing the fate of the company when talks with a major corporation about a takeover broke down amid the strife. The Consumer Council also backed actions by consumers, and used the Consumer Legal Action Fund to help consumers seek redress. A total of 2,400 complaints worth HKD $1.5 million were received. KPS Founder Garrie Roman was asked to leave by the board in November 1998 after his decision in June of the same year to fire Chief Executive Officer Rodney Miles. In the same month KPS went into receivership after rulings to repay coupons to claimants. Post-collapse Even prior to the collapse of KPS, employees were kept in the dark by management, relying on the news and rumours. Many sought new jobs among the uncertainty. When the firm went into receivership, 430 jobs were lost. The Legal Aid department petitioned the High Court to wind-up KPS's operations, so that former employees made redundant by its closure were able to claim ex-gratia payments from the Labour Department under the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund. Payments were supposed to have been made on 28 January 1999, but the wind-up of KPS was delayed due to technical issues. After the collapse, criminal organisations took advantage of the vacuum left by KPS and sold millions of dollars worth of unlicensed video CDs Takeover by Blockbuster American video-chain Blockbuster saw an opportunity to enter into the Hong Kong market, and entered into negotiations with KPS's receivers Ernst and Young to buy their operations. Blockbuster re-opened 15 out of 38 former KPS stores by 16 February 1998, and re-employed 145 former KPS staff. KPS members were given special offers to join Blockbuster, but the video pre- paid coupon system was not retained. Blockbuster pulled out of the market in 2004 after high operating costs and losses to copyright infringement. Charity work KPS was active in charity work, raising money for causes including Operation Santa Claus. In 1993, KPS was the biggest sponsors of the event, raising $430,000 Hong Kong Dollars. In 1995, KPS sponsored the KPS Video Challenge for Operation Santa Claus, in which two teams of celebrities were quizzed on their knowledge of films by Hong Kong Today presenter Hugh Chiverton at the former Furama Hotel to raise money for Sowers Action and Youth Outreach. The company also encouraged individual donations, in which the biggest donor in each store would be awarded 99 video rental coupons, while the biggest donor in Hong Kong received 999 coupons. In addition, KPS also sold videos donated by their suppliers, and forwarded proceeds directly to Operation Santa Claus. That year, the video chain raised more than $472,000 on Christmas Day by renting its videos at $8 Hong Kong dollars a tape instead of $24 Hong Kong dollars . Another $14,220 was collected from donation boxes in the stores, while the chain itself donated a further $14,000 Hong Kong dollars to bring the overall total up to $500,000 Hong Kong dollars. Legacy KPS was the only major video rental store in Hong Kong to have gained a majority of the market. At present, no other video store has come close to KPS's market share, and due to losses by copyright violation, there has not yet been an attempt to recreate a KPS-sized multimedia store.

Content In 2008, after the arrest of Ben-Ami Kadish, who allegedly gave Israel stolen United States secrets on nuclear weapons, fighter jets and missiles in the 1980s, The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles quoted Mondoweiss as writing about an old Government Accountability Office report stating that Israel \\"conducts the most aggressive espionage operation against the United States of any U.S. ally\\".Brad A.

In 2010 James Wolcott wrote in Vanity Fair quoting Weiss in Mondoweiss regarding an Anti-Defamation League statement regarding the planned Park51 project, an Islamic Center near the World Trade Center site. Wolcott quoted Weiss who had written: \\"It's happened: the Anti-Defamation League has overplayed its hand (in this case, neoconservative Islamophobia) in such a glaring manner that it is being condemned at every quarter ...\\"James Wolcott, Foxman Agonistes (Updated), Vanity Fair, July 31, 2010, accessed February 20, 2013.Philip Weiss, \\"'ADL' statement rationalizing bigotry draws wide scorn\\", Mondoweiss, July 30, 2010. In 2012 Tablet magazine asserted that the Associated Press had \\"picked up a story from advocacy blog\\" Mondoweiss, about Israeli security asking a Palestinian-American to show them her email at Ben-Gurion Airport.

The Goldstone Report Weiss and Horowitz, along with Lizzy Ratner, co-edited the 2011 book The Goldstone Report: The Legacy of the Landmark Investigation of the Gaza Conflict.Adam Horowitz, Lizzy Ratner and Philip Weiss, \\"The Goldstone Affair\\", The Nation, April 14, 2011. The Publishers Weekly review noted that the abridged version of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (\\"the Goldstone Report\\"), included an introduction by Naomi Klein and an \\"eloquent\\" forward by Bishop Desmond Tutu. The review said the book was \\"enhanced\\" by oral testimonies which \\"inject a harrowing human element to counterbalance the report's dispassionate tone\\". The review called the book \\"An essential read for those concerned with accurate documentation of historical events and nations' accountability for their treatment of civilians living in war zones\\".Review of The Goldstone Report: The Legacy of the Landmark Investigation of the Gaza Conflict, Publishers Weekly, February 14, 2011. Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"An eye- opening document and an urgent call for accountability\\".Review of The Goldstone Report, Kirkus Reviews, published online October 26, 2010. In a Democracy Now! interview Horowitz discussed Richard Goldstone's later correction of one item in his report, his saying \\"Civilians were not intentionally targeted [by Israel] as a matter of policy.\\" Horowitz expressed that he views this as a minor issue and \\"Much larger was the issue of intentionally attacking the civilian infrastructure of Gaza, which he doesn't mention, and the idea of just disproportionate and indiscriminate violence, which he doesn't address and which affects civilians disproportionately.\\"\\"Judge Goldstone Retracts Part of His Report on Israeli Assault on Gaza, Leaves Rest Intact\\", Democracy Now!, April 4, 2011.Lawrence Davidson, \\"Judge Goldstone alters his verdict\\", Ma'an News Agency, July 4, 2011, updated November 4, 2011. Reception In March 2007, Gary Kamiya in an article for the website Salon wrote that Mondoweiss offered \\"informed and passionate discussions\\" of what Weiss states are \\"delicate and controversial matters surrounding American Jewish identity and Israel\\". Kamiya also states that Weiss, \\"routinely skewers attempts by mainstream Jewish organizations and pundits to lay down the law on what is acceptable discourse\\". He gave as an example Weiss exploring \\"off-limits\\" topics like dual loyalty, as in an incident regarding the American Jewish Committee. Weiss had written that a Committee piece accusing Jewish intellectuals who did not \\"toe the party line on Israel\\" of being \\"self-haters\\" only revealed the \\"anti-intellectual, vicious, omerta practices of the Jewish leadership\\".Gary Kamiya, \\"Can American Jews unplug the Israel lobby?\\" Salon, March 20, 2007. In 2009, Michael Massing, in an article titled \\"The News About the Internet\\" for The New York Review of Books, noted that \\"Weiss is one of several friends I've seen flourish online after enduring years of frustration writing for magazines. With its unrelenting criticism of Israel, his site [Mondoweiss] has angered even some of his fellow doves, but it has given voice to a strain of opinion that in the past had few chances of being heard.\\" In November 2009 former United States Senator James G. Abourezk praised Weiss and Horowitz for their courage in taking on \\"what most believe is an unassailable, monolithic pro- Israel Lobby\\". He wrote that the blog \\"hits Israel's illegal occupation where it hurts‚Äîin the center of the American Jewish community. Mondoweiss is evidence that more and more American Jews are thinking twice about giving Israel their wholehearted, unquestioning support for the crimes it is committing in the territories it illegally occupies.\\"James G. Abourezk, \\"Mondoweiss: A Profile in Courage\\", Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, November 2009. In September 2010, James Wolcott of Vanity Fair argued that Mondoweiss \\"is one of the most invaluable sites in the blogosphere, a blast of sanity and moral suasion against the prevailing demonization of anything and anyone perceived as anti-Israel\\".James Wolcott, \\"Mondo Narco\\", Vanity Fair, September 22, 2010. In 2012 Arab News wrote that Weiss and Horowitz had \\"developed an interactive forum that brims with up-to-the-minute news and comment and makes brilliant attention-grabbing use of text and video material\\" and that \\"they bring to their work a moral and intellectual verve woefully missing from coverage of Palestine-Israel issues in even the more respected sections of the mainstream media\\".\\"Sidelining of mainstream media in Israel- Palestine debate\\", Arab News, September 30, 2012, via Highbeam. While Mondoweiss has received praise for its content, it has also been criticized, with much of the criticism coming from people and organizations with differing opinions on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. This criticism has often included allegations of antisemitism. In 2010, Mondoweiss was criticized by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs for publishing a series of cartoons which they stated expressed \\"anti-Israelism, a more recent category of anti- Semitism\\".Levick, Adam, \\"Anti-Semitic Cartoons on Progressive Blogs\\", JCPA, September 2, 2010. Between 2010 and 2011, Tablet magazine published three articles, in which Mondoweiss, along with some other blogs, were thoroughly criticized. These articles characterized Weiss as a \\"Jew-baiter\\" and \\"intensely anti-Israel\\", saying his site is \\"obsessed with Israel and the machinations of the U.S. Israel lobby\\", and laden with \\"sweeping and unsubstantiated rhetoric\\".Smith, Lee. \\"Mainstreaming Hate\\" Tablet, July 21, 2010.Smith, Lee. \\"Playing With Fire\\" Tablet, July 29, 2010.Goldberg, Michelle. \\"Mondo Weiss\\" Tablet, January 20, 2011.

Walt questioned the article's premise by stating that Smith's article contained \\"not a scintilla of evidence\\" that \\"Weiss, or I have written or said anything that is remotely anti-Semitic, much less that involves 'Jew-baiting'. There's an obvious reason for this omission: None of us has ever written or said anything that supports Smith's outrageous charges.\\"Stephen Walt, \\"The problem with judging a blog by its commenters (updated)\\", Foreign Policy, July 21, 2010. In 2012, the Algemeiner Journal characterized Mondoweiss as \\"Purveyors of Anti-Semitic Material\\".Algemeiner Staff. \\"Salon.com Partners With Purveyor of Anti-Semitic Material Mondoweiss\\", July 23, 2012. Also, Armin Rosen, a Media Fellow with The Atlantic, criticized Peter Beinart's blog, Open Zion (which appears in The Daily Beast) for publishing an article by Alex Kane because he is Mondoweisss \\"Staff Reporter\\". Rosen wrote that \\"Mondoweiss often gives the appearance of an anti-Semitic enterprise.\\"Armin Rosen, \\"A Reminder That Anti-Semitism Has No Place in Debates Over Israel\\", The Atlantic, July 14, 2012. Robert Wright, a Senior Editor at The Atlantic, responded to Rosen's article, writing \\"This tarring of Kane by virtue of his association with Mondoweiss would be lamentable even if Rosen produced a convincing indictment of Mondoweiss, showing that it indeed evinces anti-Semitism.\\"Robert Wright, \\"Neo-McCarthyism\\", The Atlantic, July 15, 2012. James Fallows, a national correspondent for The Atlantic concurred with Wright's response to Rosen.\\"In-House Items: Mayer and Yahoo\\", Mondoweiss. Alex Kane, Adam Horowitz, and Philip Weiss responded in Mondoweiss arguing that Rosen's article, \\"is about nothing more than policing the discourse on Israel\\".Responding to The Atlantic smear on Mondoweiss. Later that year, the Algemeiner Journal published another article decrying Mondoweiss for its associations with Judith Butler, in light of her recent comments describing Islamist movements, even those of the militant variety, like Hamas and Hezbollah, as \\"social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left\\".Petra Marquardt-Bigman, \\"Defending Judith Butler in The Ivory Tower\\", Algemeiner Journal, September 7, 2012. In 2013, Peter Beinart, writing for The Daily Beast, accused Mondoweiss of \\"ignoring human rights abuse unless it can be linked to America or capitalism or the West\\", and said that \\"By admitting that they're more interested in human rights violations when Israel commits them than when Hamas does, Horowitz and Roth are implying that they don't really see human rights as universal\\".Peter Beinart, \\"Why Not Criticize Hamas's Rights Violations?\\" The Daily Beast, March 13, 2013. Later in the year Commentary magazine accused Mondoweiss of being complicit in an \\"effort to delegitimize Jewish rights\\".Tobin, Jonathan S. \\"Anti-Semitic Hate for Kids ... and Adults\\", Commentary, July 8, 2013. Journalist Bradley Burston, writing for Haaretz, described Mondoweiss as \\"avowedly anti-Israel\\" in reference to its coverage of the 2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers. In 2013 Haaretz called Mondoweiss a \\"progressive Jewish website\\".\\"Mock funding drive launched to send Bibi to Mandela service\\". Haaretz, December 10, 2013. In 2015, David Bernstein, writing for The Washington Post, called the website a \\"hate site\\", and listed quotes from Weiss that he asserted were anti-Semitic. This included Weiss' claim that \\"the Israel lobby ... reflected a contract the American establishment had made with Jews to drive the economy in the 1970s\\", which Bernstein likened to a belief in an \\"Elders of Zion type group\\". According to Elliot Kaufman, the Vice President of Cardinal for Israel, a Stanford University group, writing in The Stanford Review, Mondoweiss \\"often publishes astonishingly anti-Semitic material, using classic anti-Semitic imagery such as depicting Jews as spiders, cockroaches, or octopuses with tentacles controlling others, and Holocaust inversion. Its hatred of Israel is as deep as it is vicious.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Adam Horowitz, Lizzy Ratner, Philip Weiss (eds.), The Goldstone Report: The Legacy of the Landmark Investigation of the Gaza Conflict, Nation Books, 2011, .

Bradley Alan Schwartz, also a pediatric ophthalmologist, and Ronald Bruce Bigger, a hit man, were arrested and convicted for the murder. Brian Stidham=Background= Stidham was born and raised in Longview, Texas, the son of Mack and Joyce Stidham. Stidham began attending Harvard Medical School in 1990 and graduated in 1993. He then moved to Dallas, Texas where he entered a residency program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School's internal medicine department. A year later he switched to ophthamology. While in Dallas, he met and began dating his neighbor, Daphne Herding, whom he eventually married in a garden ceremony in 1997. The couple moved to Indianapolis where Stidham undertook a fellowship in pediatric ophthalmology and adult strabismus at Indiana University. In 1998, they returned to Texas when Stidham joined the faculty at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Their first child, Alexandre Brian, was born in Houston in 2000. Their daughter, Catherine Elizabeth, was born later in Tucson in 2003. =Relocation to Tucson= In 2001, Stidham answered an ad Bradley Schwartz had placed in a trade journal seeking someone to care for the pediatric patients in his Tucson ophthalmology practice, Arizona Specialty Eye Care. Stidham was officially hired in November 2001 partly as a way to provide added support to Schwartz's booming business. Other reports suggest that Schwartz was planning to open a plastic surgery practice or, at least, another office on the north side of the city. Stidham was meant to take over the pediatric ophthalmology aspect of Schwartz's business. In December 2001, one month after Stidham joined the practice, the DEA raided the office and Schwartz was indicted by a federal grand jury on 77 counts of illegally obtaining prescription medicine. This spurred Stidham to create his own Tucson-area practice. Bradley Schwartz=Background= Bradley Alan Schwartz was born January 14, 1965 in Brooklyn, New York to Henry and Lois Schwartz. He graduated from the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1991, and married Joan Samuels in New York City four days after his graduation. The couple subsequently had three children. He worked at a hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania prior to relocating with his family to Tucson in the late '90s. A Phoenix-based ophthalmology group had hired Schwartz to open an office in Tucson. One year later when his contract expired, the group sued him for violating a restrictive covenant when he opened his own practice less than 200 yards away. The two sides settled out of court with the Phoenix group characterizing his behavior as \\"obscene, abusive, and belligerent.\\" =Drug abuse, DEA investigation, and indictment= From early 2001 to May 2004, Schwartz was involved in a romantic relationship with the foster mother of one of his patients, Pima County deputy attorney Lourdes Salomon Lopez. Schwartz had also developed a drug problem that began in 2000 when he received Vicodin for chronic back and jaw pain. He also became addicted to Ritalin. Over a two-month period during the summer of 2001, Lopez allowed Schwartz to use her name to fraudulently obtain prescriptions for the controlled substance hydrocodone. Schwartz also wrote prescriptions to his office manager, Laurie Espinoza, who would retrieve the medication and give it to Schwartz. In October 2001, two DEA agents interviewed Lopez as part of a criminal investigation involving Schwartz. Although she was instructed not to discuss their interview with Schwartz, she told Schwartz about the investigation and interview within the following 24 hours. In December 2001, DEA agents raided Schwartz's office. In September 2002, a grand jury issued a 77-count indictment on charges related to Schwartz writing Vicodin and Ritalin prescriptions for two patients (Lopez and Espinoza) who returned the drugs to him for his own use. Schwartz's wife, Joan, filed for divorce the following month. Schwartz initially pleaded guilty to the drug charges in 2003; however, the plea was withdrawn in early 2004. In June 2003, Schwartz and Lopez were involved in a domestic altercation which resulted in an amendment to the conditions for their release, prohibiting them from having contact with each other. In November 2003, Schwartz was placed on five years' probation by the Arizona Medical Board for \\"unprofessional conduct.\\" Under the terms of the probation, Schwartz was barred from writing prescriptions for narcotics, required to check in with the board each day, and subject to random drug tests. Schwartz attended rehab later that year and admitted that he had a drug problem. This occurred shortly after the Arizona Medical Board had reinstated Schwartz's license in August 2003. In March 2004, the conditions of Schwartz and Lopez's release were modified to allow the two to have contact with each other. However, the two had already been seeing each other and were even engaged to be married. Professional relationship severed The relationship between Brian Stidham and Bradley Schwartz began to deteriorate soon after Stidham was hired in November 2001. Stidham officially served as Schwartz's associate until October 2002, at which point Schwartz was indicted on drug fraud charges. Stidham gave Schwartz 30 days' notice and began making plans to start his own practice across town. Stidham told friends that his partner (Schwartz) had been acting \\"weird\\" and that he needed to remove himself from the situation. Because of the indictment, Schwartz lost his medical license and entered into rehab. When he received word that Stidham was still recruiting patients, Schwartz became angry and even directly told his girlfriend, Lourdes Lopez, and other friends that he wanted to kill Stidham. While Stidham was still under Schwartz's employ, Schwartz instructed his parents to fire Stidham. Some of Schwartz's patients went to Stidham's new practice, many of whom stayed with Stidham even when Schwartz had started practicing again. Despite the fact that Stidham's new practice was on the opposite side of town, Schwartz was convinced that his former partner was deliberately stealing his clients. Murder and investigation On the evening of October 5, 2004, deputies of the Pima County Sheriff‚Äôs Department responded to a report of a man down in the parking lot of the North First Medical Plaza where Stidham worked. Differing reports say his body was found by either a cleaning crew or Christine Rotella, a massage therapist who had returned to the medical plaza to retrieve her forgotten engagement ring. The victim, identified as Stidham, had been stabbed 15 times and had incurred a skull fracture. He was killed in his 1992 white Lexus SC400 and dragged from his car to make it look like a robbery. The car was later found at an apartment complex over six miles away. Schwartz was the case's primary suspect from October 6 onward, the day after Stidham's murder. On the night of the murder, Schwartz was with Lisa Goldberg, a girlfriend he had recently begun seeing after meeting her on an online dating service. Earlier in the day, Schwartz had engaged in a series of phone calls with Ronald Bruce Bigger. One of these phone calls included Bigger repeatedly asking, \\"Where is my money?\\" Conflicting reports suggest that Schwartz had either met Bigger at Narcotics Anonymous or at his medical practice. Schwartz and Goldberg were eating at a Thai restaurant in Tucson shortly after the murder occurred. Bigger reportedly met up with the two at the restaurant. Schwartz introduced him to Goldberg as \\"Bruce.\\" Schwartz would later take Bigger to an automated teller machine (ATM) and then check him into a hotel. The following day after a conversation in which Schwartz denied to her that he was involved in the murder, Goldberg telephoned the police to report her suspicions and indicated that a man named \\"Bruce\\" had joined them while they were at dinner. The investigation eventually revealed that Schwartz hired Bigger for $10,000 to help him murder Stidham. Bigger had previously been convicted of criminal recklessness, check deception, and possession of marijuana in LaPorte, Indiana and was a fugitive from that state. Schwartz was with his girlfriend in a public restaurant but there are cell phone records linking Schwartz's cell phone to a convenience store pay phone, where Bigger allegedly visited that evening, and to Bigger's hotel, which was paid for by Schwartz. A sample of DNA linked to Bigger was found on the radio knob of Stidham's car. On October 15, police captured Bigger who was hiding just outside Tucson. They also arrested Schwartz the very same night. When police arrived at his apartment, he was found naked with a woman. He was taken away with such haste that his shirt was on backwards. From jail, Schwartz pleaded with Lourdes Lopez, his former lover, to be his attorney, but she refused. On October 28, Lopez reported that, prior to the murder, she had expressed to Paul Skitzki, a county prosecutor with whom she was on friendly terms, her concerns about what Schwartz might do to Stidham. The case was transferred from Pima County to Pinal County because of the nature of Lopez's past work relationship with Pima County. Trials and convictions Schwartz and Bigger were both charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Both men also pleaded \\"not guilty.\\" After some delay, the trial for Schwartz began in March 2006. Bigger's trials would not begin until the following March. Schwartz was provided with a court-appointed defense attorney named Brick Storts. Early on, Storts suggested that the attorney-client relationship between Schwartz and Lopez precluded the case from going to trial. Other arguments Storts used revolved around discrepancies between the time of death, Bigger's whereabouts, and the fact that the $10,000 had seemingly vanished. Prosecuting attorney Sylvia Lafferty pointed to Schwartz's cell phone records, which showed that he received calls from a payphone at a Denny's across the street from Stidham's office. Schwartz's cell phone also received calls from Bigger's hotel room, which Schwartz had paid for. The nature of the phone discussions had changed over the course of the night. Schwartz began to reassure Bigger that he had his money. Lafferty also brought up the fact that Schwartz harbored a well- known vendetta against Stidham. Many individuals took the stand, including ex- girlfriends, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances, many of whom confirmed that Schwartz often talked about his hatred for Stidham. The DNA evidence from Bigger in Stidham's car also provided evidence for the prosecution. Throughout his trial, Schwartz never took the stand. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for conspiracy to murder Stidham. Because the jury could not make a decision on the first-degree murder charge, Schwartz would have been eligible for parole after serving 25 years (in 2029). Schwartz's trial lasted two months, and it took the jury five days to deliver a verdict. The trial officially ended on May 2, 2006. Bigger's trial took place from March 14, 2007, to May 16, 2007. Bigger's defense attorney, Jill Thorpe, tried to prove that it was Schwartz who had actually physically committed the murder. Both the prosecution and the defense attacked Schwartz's character. Lead prosecutors Sylvia Lafferty and Richard Platt also brought in a more sophisticated DNA analysis than the one used for the Schwartz trial. The trial ended up painting Schwartz as an extremely manipulative individual, causing the jury to feel sympathy for Bigger. Nevertheless, the jury found Bigger guilty of both conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and first- degree murder itself. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Aftermath Attorneys for Schwartz and Bigger filed appeals almost immediately after sentencing. Bigger's appeal suggested that he was not afforded a fair trial on account of the copious amount of media coverage surrounding the case. Despite the fact that 83% of the jury pool had been exposed to some of the pretrial media, Bigger's appeal was thrown out by the Arizona Court of Appeals in May 2011. Bruce Bigger's attorneys felt that the trial should have taken place outside of Pima County where it had been less publicized. Schwartz has repeatedly made headlines since his imprisonment. In 2009, Schwartz claimed to have been attacked numerous times by inmates. He sustained injuries to his eye sockets and tear ducts and suffered nasal damage and facial fractures that required plastic surgery. He also noted that his vision had been permanently damaged. He, along with attorney Brick Storts, attempted to sue the state of Arizona for $750,000. Another inmate was convicted of aggravated assault for beating up Schwartz. Schwartz's ex- fiancee, Lourdes Lopez, who resigned as prosecutor after being indicted in federal court, continued to work as a defense attorney after disciplinary action had taken place. A complaint was filed against her by the Arizona State Bar as a result of her involvement with Bradley Schwartz's drug fraud. In 2007, the Arizona Supreme Court officially disbarred her for her connection to the drug case. The result was one that reportedly pleased the state bar. She continues to work as a paralegal. Brian Stidham's widow, Daphne Stidham, filed a wrongful death suit in 2005 against the medical complex where her husband was murdered, alleging that the conditions at the complex aided the killer. She settled that suit for an undisclosed amount. Mrs. Stidham also filed a suit in August 2005 against Pima County, Lourdes Lopez, Paul Skitzki, and county attorney Barbara LaWall. The case alleged that the parties involved could have helped prevent Brian Stidham's murder. LaWall even testified that if Skitzki or Lopez had come forward sooner, Dr. Stidham would still be alive. Although the original case sought $20 million in a claim against the county, Mrs. Stidham settled for $2.29 million in 2007. Lourdes Lopez, Barbara LaWall, and Pima County were dismissed from the suit as part of the settlement. Pima County paid the entire amount on behalf of Paul Skitzki. Media coverage According to Bonnie Booth of the American Medical News, the rarity of physician-on-physician crime was the likely reason that the trial drew so much media attention. In addition to local media outlets, Court TV and CBS's 48 Hours provided coverage to a national audience. A.J. Flick, a reporter who covered the case for the Tucson Citizen, wrote a best-selling, true-crime book published in 2018 titled \\"Toxic Rage: A Tale of Murder in Tucson\\" (WildBlue Press). The events surrounding the 2004 murder were broadcast on the Investigation Discovery series Solved in October 2008. The events of the murder were also covered in an episode of Forensic Files titled \\"Office Visit\\", which aired on January 22, 2010, on truTV.

Founded as a branch of the Sinaloa Cartel, the Beltr√°n Leyva cartel was responsible for transportation and wholesaling of cocaine, heroin and marijuana (and the production of the last two). It controlled numerous drug trafficking corridors, and engaged in human smuggling, money laundering, extortion, kidnapping, murder and gun-running. The BLO was one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels, which had effectively infiltrated the ranks of various Mexican government agencies and Mexico's Interpol. Its last known leader, H√©ctor Beltr√°n Leyva, was arrested in October 2014, having had a multimillion-dollar bounty placed on him by the governments of both the United States and Mexico. On August 11, 2011 the capture of one of the cartel's former top lieutenants, called \\"the last Beltran-Leyva link of any importance\\", prompted Mexican authorities to declare the cartel disbanded and extinct. History Born in the Sinaloan countryside in the 1960s, the Beltr√°n Leyva brothers ‚Äî Arturo, Carlos, Alfredo, Mario Alberto and H√©ctor ‚Äî worked closely with their cousin, Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, during decades of smuggling. Sensing a void in the rival Gulf Cartel after Osiel C√°rdenas' arrest on March 14, 2003, the Sinaloa Cartel began to move into Gulf Cartel territory. The gangs fought each other in northern Mexican cities, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people, including some civilians, police and journalists. In 2004 and 2005, Arturo Beltr√°n Leyva led powerful groups of assassins to fight for trade routes in northeastern Mexico for the Sinaloa Cartel. Through the use of corruption or intimidation, the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel was able to infiltrate Mexico's political, judicial and police institutions to feed classified information about anti-drug operations, and even infiltrated the Interpol office in Mexico. During 2010, former Beltran Leyva cartel lieutenant √ìscar Osvaldo Garc√≠a Montoya (a.k.a. El CompayitoCae el l√≠der de La Mano con Ojos; lo vinculan con 600 homicidios: La Polic√≠a del Estado de M√©xico detuvo en la delegaci√≥n Tlalpan a √ìscar Osvaldo Garc√≠a Montoya, El Compayito; el capo trabaj√≥ con los hermanos Beltr√°n Leyva. √Ångeles Velasco. Excelsior. Mexico City, Mexico. Retrieved March 7, 2012.) attempted to regroup some cartel remnants under a gang he called La Mano Con Ojos. Garc√≠a Montoya was arrested on August 11, 2011; the Attorney General of Mexico had placed a 5million pesos (US$400,000) bounty for his capture. Mexican authorities stated that Garc√≠a Montoya was \\"the last Beltr√°n-Leyva link of any importance\\", and that the cartel has been disbanded. Allied forces of Los Zetas and Beltr√°n-Leyva remnants clashed on April 28, 2012 with gunmen of the Sinaloa Cartel in the Choix mountains. At least 32 armed men were confirmed dead. The renewed fighting in Sinaloa state between the BLO and Sinaloa Cartel is supposedly sparked by the incursion of the Sinaloa Cartel and its allies in Nuevo Laredo, traditionally the biggest Zeta stronghold. The last cartel leader, H√©ctor Beltr√°n Leyva, was captured on October 1, 2014 while eating at a popular restaurant in San Miguel de Allende. The U.S. was offering a reward of US$5million for information leading to his arrest. while the Mexican government was offering a US$2.1million reward. =Switch of alliances= The arrest of Beltr√°n Leyva Organization leader Alfredo Beltr√°n Leyva (a.k.a. El Mochomo) (\\"The Desert Ant\\") on January 20, 2008, was a huge blow to the Sinaloa Cartel, as he allegedly oversaw large-scale drug-smuggling operations and was a key money launderer for the cartel. In apparent revenge for the arrest of his brother Alfredo, Arturo ordered the assassination of the commissioner of the Federal Police, √âdgar Eusebio Mill√°n G√≥mez, and other top federal officials in the Mexican capital. One group of these hit men was captured in a Mexico City house with dozens of assault rifles, pistols, grenade launchers, 30 hand grenades, and bullet-proof jackets bearing the legend FEDA ‚Äì the Spanish acronym for 'Special Forces of Arturo'. Apparently, the Beltr√°n Leyva brothers blamed their partner Joaquin \\"Chapo\\" Guzm√°n for their brother's arrest, and in retaliation ordered the assassination of Guzm√°n's son, 22-year-old √âdgar Guzm√°n L√≥pez, which was carried out in a shopping center parking lot by at least 15 gunmen using assault rifles and grenade launchers. The residual impact of Alfredo's arrest not only undermined long-term Sinaloa alliances, but resurrected animosities between rival cartel leaders Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n and Arturo's new allies, the Ju√°rez Cartel, and provided the catalyst behind the bloodshed in Mexico's most-violent city: Ciudad Ju√°rez. The Beltr√°n Leyva brothers, and those loyalists who departed the Sinaloa Cartel with them, allied with Los Zetas, causing an escalation of conflict in strongholds shared uneasily by \\"old\\" Sinaloa leaders. In February 2010, the Beltr√°n-Leyva Cartel and Los Zetas engaged in a violent turf war against the new alliance integrated by the Gulf Cartel, Sinaloa Cartel and La Familia Cartel in the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, rendering some border towns \\"ghost towns\\".Video: Narco deja pueblos fantasma en Tamaulipas (March 4, 2010). Official reports from early 2010 revealed infighting for control of the cartel and its territory. One faction was led by lieutenants √âdgar Valdez Villarreal and Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez, while the other was led by H√©ctor Beltr√°n Leyva and his lieutenant Sergio Villarreal Barrag√°n. In April 2010, H√©ctor Beltr√°n Leyva created a short-lived cell or branch in Morelos state called South Pacific Cartel (C√°rtel del Pac√≠fico Sur) best known for having employed a 12-year-old gunman and executioner. Assets The cartel's assets included: *Dominance over drug and other illegal activities at airports in Mexico, Monterrey, Toluca, Canc√∫n, and Acapulco; *Hotels and restaurants constructed to launder money in Canc√∫n, Acapulco, Cozumel, and other resorts; *A working agreement with Los Zetas. *Supply corridors for moving marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine from the Andes to the Arctic; *Capability to extort, launder money, run guns, smuggle humans, promote prostitution and carry out kidnappings; *Operations in Mexico City, Chiapas, Guerrero, Guanajuato, Mexico State, Morelos, Nuevo Le√≥n, Quer√©taro, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, Sonora, and Tamaulipas, as well as in the United States and Canada; *Access to some high-ranking public figures and Army personnel whom they bribed or intimidated. ;Former suppliers The Beltr√°n Leyva brothers‚Äô Colombian cocaine supplier, Ever Villafane Mart√≠nez, was arrested in Morelos in August 2008. After that, the organization pursued a relationship with V√≠ctor and Dar√≠o Espinoza Valencia of Colombia's Norte del Valle cartel. Bounty The United States offered a US$5million reward for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of H√©ctor Beltr√°n Leyva. Captures Alfredo Beltr√°n Leyva was captured on January 20, 2008, and Arturo was killed by Mexican Marines in a shootout on December 16, 2009. Two weeks following Arturo's death, on December 30, 2009, Carlos Beltr√°n Leyva was captured by the Mexican Federal Police in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa after showing authorities a fake driver's license of an alias he was living under. Carlos was arrested on charges outstanding since 2008, including drug trafficking, criminal conspiracy, money laundering and illegal firearms. At the same time as federal police arrested Carlos, Beltr√°n Leyva associates who allegedly murdered four relatives - a mother, siblings and an aunt - of one of the marines involved in the shootout that killed Arturo, were also arrested by Mexican authorities, with a hitman allegedly confessing to the crimes. The killings, allegedly in retaliation for Arturo's death, happened hours after the marine's funeral. On April 22, 2010, cartel lieutenant Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez was captured on the outskirts of Mexico City; the U.S. had been offering a $2 million U.S. bounty for his arrest. Edgar Valdez Villarreal, the leader of Los Negros cartel enforcement, was arrested on August 30, 2010 outside Mexico City. On January 18, 2011, Jos√© Jorge Balderas Garza, known as \\"JJ\\", the lieutenant and financial operator of the Valdez-Villarreal faction, was captured. On September 12, 2010, Sergio Villarreal Barrag√°n was arrested in the city of Puebla, east of Mexico City. H√©ctor Beltr√°n Leyva was captured by the Mexican Armed Forces on October 1, 2014. The August 11, 2011 arrest of √ìscar Osvaldo Garc√≠a Montoya (a.k.a. El Compayito), a cartel lieutenant, was called \\"the last Beltran-Leyva link of any importance\\". On April 16, 2014, the second-in- command, Arnoldo Villa S√°nchez, was captured by Mexican authorities in the Condesa district in Mexico City. On October 1, 2014, Hector Beltran Leyva and business associate German Goyenechea, who had become the cartel's chief financier, were both captured while eating at a popular restaurant in San Miguel de Allende. On October 11, 2017, the U.S. Justice Department arrested Sajid Emilio Quintero Navidad, 36, at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. He was charged with money-laundering and drug-trafficking. Navidad, who also goes by the name \\"El Cadete,\\" is the cousin of fugitive drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who is allegedly responsible for the killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique \\"Kiki\\" Camarena. On July 4, 2019, H√©ctor Huerta R√≠os, the leader of the Beltran-Leyva Cartel in Nuevo Leon who was previously arrested in 2009, was killed by a rival cartel after being shot while driving in Jalisco. His wife, who was in the car with her husband and their two daughters, identified his body to police the next day. Split Following the death of Arturo Beltran Leyva on December 16, 2009, and the arrest of Edgar Valdez Villarreal on August 30, 2010, the Beltran Leyva brothers lost much of their influence. The cartel then divided into separate independent groups: * Los Mazatlecos in Sinaloa and Nayarit, an armed loyalist wing of the Beltr√°n Leyva brothers, currently fighting the Sinaloa Cartel in northern Sinaloa. * Los Negros a former Beltran-Leyva enforcement squad, loyal to Edgar Valdez Villarreal after infighting broke out. * Fuerzas Especiales De Arturo (Special Forces of Arturo), an elite hitsquad loyal to Arturo Beltran- Leyva. * Independent Cartel of Acapulco in Guerrero, currently fighting La Barredora. * La Oficina In Aguascalientes & Zacatecas. Believed to be run by Chapo Isidro current leader of the Beltran Leyva organization along with the Velasco family well known in the mentioned state of Aguascalientes. * Los Charritos Most active hitsquad believed to have a heavy presence in the US. (Chicago, Atlanta, LA ,Las Vegas) * La Barredora in Guerrero, currently fighting the Independent Cartel of Acapulco. * South Pacific Cartel in Morelos, a short-lived cell. * Los Pelones in Morelos. These are former enforcers of the Beltr√°n-Leyva brothers, now part of the Gulf Cartel. * Los Rojos, in Guerrero. These are former enforcers of the Beltr√°n-Leyva brothers, apparently independent and dominating much of Guerrero. * Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) in Morelos and Guerrero. ** Los Tequileros, a cell of Guerreros Unidos in Tierra Caliente that specializes in extorting politicians.

Life The son of a farmer, William Clancy was born in West Cork and educated at St. Patrick's, Carlow College in Carlow, and St Patrick's College, Maynooth. He was ordained to the priesthood at Maynooth on May 24, 1823. He then served as a curate until 1829, when he became a professor of theology at St. Patrick's, Carlow. John England, Bishop of Charleston, South Carolina, had been appointed as the Pope‚Äôs Legate to the Government of Haiti. Due to the additional responsibilities, England requested assistance. On October 30, 1834, Clancy was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Charleston, South Carolina and Titular Bishop of Oreus by Pope Gregory XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 21 at the Cathedral of the Assumption, Carlow,\\"Most Rev. William Clancy\\", Diocese of Cork and Ross from Bishop Edward Nolan, with Archbishop Michael Slattery and Bishop William Kinsella serving as co- consecrators. He served as coadjutor to Bishop John England, who was busied with the vast jurisdiction of the diocese and his work as papal legate to Haiti. Charleston, South Carolina Clancy's arrival in Charleston was delayed to a severe illness. Upon recovering, he visited family and friends in Cork and Carlow, and attempted to recruit priests and seminarians for Charleston. A personal reluctance also factored into his delay: \\"If there is any other place where the knowledge of philosophy and theology and the faculty of preaching in English would rebound to the glory of God [let me go there]. If however the Holy Father insists I shall go with an heavy heart.\\" He finally arrived in Charleston in November 1835. After a few months' dissatisfied sojourn, Clancy requested a transfer to another field. He claimed there was an insufficient amount of work to be done, and Bishop England wrote to Rome: \\"He is very distinguished for his character, zeal and piety, but in one year he has wrecked that whole constitutional system of church government which has taken me years to perfect.\\" He attended the Third Provincial Council of Baltimore in 1837, and in July of that year was translated to the see of Demerara, British Guiana (Guyana)as Vicar Apostolic of British Guiana. =Washington Irving= In 1837, a Protestant lady brought to Clancy's attention a passage in The Crayon Miscellany, and questioned whether it accurately reflected Catholic teaching or practice. The passage under \\"Newstead Abbey\\" read: > One of the parchment scrolls thus discovered, throws rather an awkward life > upon the kind of life led by the friars of Newstead. It is an indulgence > granted to them for a certain number of months, in which a plenary pardon is > assured in advance for all kinds of crimes, among which, several of the most > gross and sensual are specifically mentioned, and the weaknesses of the > flesh to which they were prone.Irving, Washington. \\"The Lake\\", The Crayon > Miscellany, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1849, p. 339 Clancy wrote Irving, who \\"...promptly aided the investigation into the truth, and promised to correct in future editions the misrepresentation complained of....\\" Clancy traveled to his new posting by way of England, and bearing a letter of introduction from Irving, stopped at Newstead Abbey and was able to view the document to which Irving had alluded. Upon inspection, Clancy discovered that the document was not any sort of indulgence issued to the friars from any ecclesiastical authority, but a pardon given by the king to some parties suspected of having broken \\"forest laws\\". Clancy requested the local pastor to forward his findings to Catholic periodicals in England, and upon publication, forward a copy to Irving. Whether this was done is not clear as the disputed text remains in the 1849 edition. British Guiana Clancy recruited clergy from Italy, Austria, England and his native Ireland, also introducing the Presentation Sisters. He resigned as Vicar Apostolic on September 3, 1843. Retiring to Ireland, he died at Cork less than four years later, aged 45.

The trio covered a wide variety of performance styles, and perform a combination of original material and pop parodies. History The Axis of Awesome formed in 2006, their name being a play on the phrase \\"axis of evil\\" used by United States President George W. Bush. The trio were heavily involved in improv theatre at the University of Sydney and decided to try something different. The band played at a few stand up comedy nights and improv events in Sydney and performed a fortnightly segment on FBi Radio, but got their first big break when they released a number of rap parodies lampooning the 2007 Australian Federal Election. The band gained further success performing in the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and making television and radio appearances. Their 2008 Melbourne International Comedy Festival show, titled \\"The Axis of Awesome Comeback Spectacular\\", received a Moosehead Award. They took the show to the Edinburgh Fringe in 2008 where it was received with critical and audience acclaim. After the Edinburgh festival, the Axis of Awesome's song \\"4 Chords\\", a medley of 36 pop songs that all contain the same basic chord structure, received airplay on BBC Radio 1. This airplay drove listeners to the internet and \\"4 Chords\\" went viral, receiving millions of hits on YouTube. The success on YouTube prompted increased interest, both home and abroad, and the Axis performed the song on many radio and television programs, including Nova 96.9, Triple M, The Footy Show, Good News Week and 9am with David & Kim. In April 2009, the Axis of Awesome performed at The Melbourne International Comedy Festival with a new show, The Axis of Awesome vs Bee.The Axis of Awesome vs Bee  Melbourne International Comedy Festival - 1-26 April 2009 The show wove the band's songs into a narrative involving a giant bee. The Axis of Awesome vs Bee was also performed at the Sydney Comedy Festival (formerly The Cracker Comedy Festival) in May 2009. The Axis toured regional Queensland and New South Wales as part of The Melbourne Comedy festival roadshow and performed at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival2009 Adelaide Cabaret Festival - 5th - 20th June 2009 in May and June. They returned to The Edinburgh fringe in August with a new sell-out show \\"The Axis of Awesome: Infinity Rock Explosion\\" and appeared at the World's Funniest Island festival in Sydney in October. In February 2010, the Axis of Awesome released their second album Infinity Rock Explosion! and performed sold out seasons at The Adelaide Fringe Festival, The Melbourne International Comedy Festival, The Sydney Comedy Festival and The Singapore Flipside Festival. They received The Time Out award for best local talent at the Sydney comedy festival and recorded their first DVD, The Axis of Awesome Live which was released in Australia on 6 October 2010 by Punchline and Beyond Entertainment. They returned to the Edinburgh Festival again in 2014 with their new show \\"Viva La Vida Loca Las Vegas\\". In February 2016, Jordan publicly came out as transgender. She was pleasantly surprised by the \\"overwhelmingly positive\\" public reaction. Their new album - Viva La Vida Loca Las Vegas - featured a cover of \\"Transgender Dysphoria Blues\\" by Against Me!. In August 2018, the band announced on Facebook that they would no longer be performing together as The Axis of Awesome. In 2020 Jordan explained, through a YouTube video, that the band had originally decided to take a break, and that break had become permanent. She explained that she still wished the band were together performing, but people grow and change over time and a decade together is a long time. Discography=Albums= *Scissors, Paper, Rock!

It is a medley of popular songs, set to the I‚ÄìV‚Äìvi‚ÄìIV progression. Many of the songs selected do not actually follow this four-chord progression, and some of the ones that do only include it briefly. Since these four chords are played as an ostinato, the band also uses a vi‚ÄìIV‚ÄìI‚ÄìV, usually from the song \\"Save Tonight\\" to the song \\"Torn\\". The band plays the song in the key of D (E in the live performances on YouTube), so the progression they use is D‚ÄìA‚ÄìBm‚ÄìG (E, B, C#m, A on the live performances). Most of the songs have been transposed from their original keys. The band continually vary the songs comprising the medley, often incorporating new releases. The Axis' song \\"Birdplane\\" (itself a parody of the Five for Fighting song \\"Superman\\") is always included, as well as Australian folk song \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" and \\"Down Under\\" by the Australian band Men at Work. The medley usually starts with Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\". The song always concludes with the chorus of \\"Scar\\" (by Missy Higgins), except with the final line changed from \\"Could you leave me with a scar?\\" to \\"That's all it takes to be a star\\" (referring to the four chords themselves). On 20 July 2011, the Axis of Awesome released an official music video for \\"Four Chords\\" on their YouTube channel.

Notable Works =Keepalive= Keepalive is a permanent outdoor sculpture in Niedersachsen, Germany, commissioned by the Center for Digital Cultures, Leuphana University L√ºneburg. The title, Keepalive, refers to the keepalive signal, a message ‚Äì often sent at predetermined intervals ‚Äì that is used on networks to check the link between two devices, to make a diagnosis or to indicate to the internet infrastructure that the connection should be preserved. Domenico Quaranta described the work as generating, \\"...a fiction that ironically locates it in a post-apocalyptic, cyberpunk scenario where humanity has been ‚Äúkept alive‚Äù, the internet is over and power is provided by fire, but also where technologies and pieces of information have survived as digital junk. Presented as an artwork and preserved as such, it may once turn useful and even essential for a wandering Mad Max to survive, as the only remaining access point to basic information.\\" =Dead Drops= Dead Drops Bartholl's ongoing Dead Drops project, started in 2010, set up an offline peer-to-peer file-sharing network at five public locations in New York using dead drops: USB sticks cemented into walls. The project has expanded exponentially around the world‚Äîover 1,400 of them have been placed in dozens of countries, including South Africa, Ghana, Germany, Iran and Russia. The Dead Drops concept was extended in 2013 with the DVD Dead Drop installation at the Museum of the Moving Image (New York City). Bartholl embedded an inconspicuous, slot-loading DVD burner into the side of the Museum, available to the public 24 hours a day. Visitors who found the Dead Drop and inserted a blank DVD-R received a digital art exhibition, a collection of media, or other featured content curated by Bartholl or selected artists. In 2011, Dead Drops was included in the \\"Talk to Me\\" show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. =Map= Map by Aram Bartholl at the show Hello World, Kasseler Kunstverein2013 In 2006, Bartholl created a public art installation called Map. Bartholl installs a large physical representation of the Google Maps pin in the exact location that Google Maps identifies as the centre of a city.http://www.goethe.de/ins/ee/prj/gtw/aus/wer/bar/enindex.htm Locations thus far have included Taipei, Berlin, Arles, Tallinn and Kassel. Each sculpture remains in place for about three months, usually coinciding with a local art festival or exhibit.http://datenform.de/blog/tag/map/ The series was designed to raise viewers' awareness of the increasing overlap between the virtual and the physical, and to highlight mapping services' influence on perceptions of location. Bartholl's physical representations of the Google Maps pin urges viewers to reevaluate the information given by digitized maps, the meaning of the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù of a city, the politicization of boundaries, and other issues related to maps and the digital versus the physical world.http://www.datenform.de/mapeng.html  Exhibitions  Bartholl's work has been shown internationally in solo and group exhibitions. He is one of the artists selected for the 5th Skulptur Projekte M√ºnster in 2017, a once every ten years exhibition curated by Kasper K√∂nig that has previously featured artists such as Naim Jun Paik, Mike Kelly, Rachael Whiteread, Mark Wallinger and Rosemarie Trockel.

John Simmons, son of a National Security Agency (NSA) employee, supposedly grew up amid the spy community in Washington, D.C. during the Cold War. It was life as normal, as far as he knew, to live at remote electronic listening posts, to \\"pop in and out of Washington every once in a while,\\" to attend a different school and make new friends every two years. That didn't bother him at all. \\"It was fun, and it helped me prepare for this wacky life style.\\" He attended the University of North Carolina and then spent a year abroad at the University of Kent in Canterbury. He studied theatre and history (\\"not theatre history\\", he emphasizes), then ended up dropping the theatre and graduating in history and journalism. \\"I like history more than anything. I think that may be why I make fun of the news. The kind of stupidity that's going on now has just been repeated through the centuries; it's nothing new.\\" The idea of becoming involved in comedy goes bock to Simmons' very early years; he never really wanted to do anything else. \\"I wanted to have a comedy group, but it didn't seem right. It didn't seem like it was attainable, for some reason. There's no career path for comedy, is there? You don't go to Slapstick University. Comedy was a real fringe area when I was growing up; stand-up comedy wasn't especially popular then. And improv comedy today is still considered a stepchild to stand-up.\\" In 1980, following the year abroad, he got a job as a reporter for CCH (Commerce Clearing House), a \\"really boring\\" law publications company, and formed Gross National Product (under another name) for excitement and fun. \\"I lived this kind of Clark Kent existence. But it was a really great cover. I could go in, look at the Wire service, and if nothing was going on I'd just go home and go to bed. It did give me access to press conferences at the White House and lots of government agencies, but to translate what really goes on at that bureaucratic level is impossible. It's so inside the Beltway that you can't really make fun of it, so you go after what's in the news.\\" GNP was one of the first comedy groups in Washington DC. \\"There was no venue for comedy then; we played in rock clubs.\\" They did a lot of revues, performed in all the clubs in DC and Baltimore, MD, and developed a loyal following. In 1982, while continuing in DC, they started performing in clubs all over New York City. Then Simmons put GNP on hiatus for a two-year interval, 1984‚Äì86, when he came to Los Angeles to \\"check it out\\". His stay in Los Angeles included engagements at the Cast Theatre, The Comedy Store, and as understudy to John Roarke in the Odyssey Theatre'sOdyssey Theatre RAP MASTER RONNIE. The satirical and political theme of his comedy continued regardless of location. Upon returning to Washington, D.C., he revived GNP with a new cast and their popularity resumed. The original 80-seat space eventually proved to be too small, and in 1988 they moved to a larger 300-seat venue at The Bayou, the largest night club in Washington DC. Also in 1988, GNP inaugurated their Scandal Tours, an irreverent bus tour of the notorious scandal spots in DC. What might explain the transition from a patriotic, NSA-oriented young boy to someone who looks at the political and social world with such a cynical eye? \\"Washingtonians are pretty cynical people: it's the political people and the people who work for them who are usually serious. I'm the product of a very cynical age. When I was in high school, the Watergate scandal was happening. The people that I associated with were the sons and daughters of reporters and that ilk, so we had a good time during Watergate. When you live in Washington and see this parade of \\"out-of-towners\\" every four years, you make fun of them. Some of them are real dorks, many of them are there because of political-favor appointments, and they always roll in with this sense of greatness. People in Washington are up on what's happening and they want to make fun. So we started to make fun of Congress and the Executive Branch.\\" Just as Simmons grew up with Watergate, GNP grew up with President Ronald Reagan, their favorite target for several years. \\"But we make fun of liberals, too. It depends on who's in power.\\" The ability to adapt to a constantly changing world keeps GNP's revues up to the minute in content. For example: \\"The LA situation cannot be ignored. Right now, right here, the entire focus of a political debate has shifted. We're in the center at what's going on. It's a tragedy, just like the Contra thing, but somehow it's government with their pants down, and they look foolish.\\"  GNP alumni  Over the years, GNP has involved the talents of Robin Abb, Kevin Brown, Ron Butler, Doug Cox, Larry Coven, Marianne Curan, Sarah Delea, Brad Dismukes, Liz Domery, John Dryden, Shari Elliker, Dion Flynn, Elliott Forrestt, Bob Garman, Tim Gore, Robert W.

Atkins Academic & Technology High School is a high school in Winston- Salem, North Carolina. It opened in the fall of 2005 as a technology magnet school. Atkins is distinct in that it houses three separate academies: Biotechnology, Computer Technology, and Pre-Engineering. These departments were originally three separate schools under the Atkins Complex, but as of the 2010-11 school year, the schools were integrated into one establishment, for administrative ease. The three departments offer students various \\"majors,\\" which provide focused environments in which students can explore their interests before they enroll in college. The school is named after Simon Green Atkins. Facility The school was designed for 1,000 students, with core space for 1,400. Among the 28 classrooms, special labs and technology spaces were planned for hands-on learning in computer engineering, chemistry, biology, biotechnology research, physics, and physical science. An open cafeteria space features ample natural lighting and high ceilings with exposed structural components. The exposed structure is continued throughout the main gymnasium, the auxiliary gym, and the school‚Äôs central circulation spine. The state-of-the-art auditorium, with seating for 800, features a movable wall to accommodate different uses. In addition to the typical functions of a school media center, the space has computer and classroom areas equipped with electronic whiteboards and network access, and multimedia workstation available for student use. Athletics Sports available include football, lacrosse, cross country, track, tennis, swimming, and soccer, among others. A football and track stadium is located on the campus, adjacent to a tennis court, as well as football and soccer practice fields. Controversy In 2015 two students were charged with making felony threats of violence against the school. One of these student's family made accusations of administrative disciplinary overreach due to actions taken by the school administration over threats of violence from a teenage student. They filed a lawsuit alleging the investigation was mishandled because the student was questioned without his parents being present after they asked to be.

In 1790, she received a medal from the Society of Arts. Biography=Early life= Hanging Partridge Born in Birmingham in 1755, Mary Linwood moved to Leicester in 1764 with her family after her father, a wine merchant, became bankrupt. He died young and her mother opened a private boarding school for young ladies in Belgrave Gate. When her mother died Linwood took over the school and continued it for 50 years. Linwood made her first embroidered picture when she was thirteen years old, and by 1775 had established herself as a needlework artist.The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts, Gordon Campbell By the age of 31, Mary had attracted the attention of the royal family, and she was invited to Windsor Castle by Queen Charlotte along with Mary Delaney and Mary Knowles whom the queen also engaged with to show their work. =Exhibitions= For nearly seventy-five years Mary worked in worsted embroidery, producing a collection of over 100 pictures that specialised in full size copies of old masters. She opened an exhibition in the Hanover Square Rooms in 1798, which afterward travelled to Leicester Square, Edinburgh and Dublin. Mary Linwood's copies of old master paintings in crewel wool (named from the crewel or worsted wool used), in which the irregular and sloping stitches resembled brushwork, achieved great fame from the time of her first London exhibition in 1787. She met most of the crowned heads of Europe. She exhibited in Russia and Catherine the Great offered ¬£40,000 for the whole collection while the Tsar offered her ¬£3,000 for one example. However, Linwood refused as she wished her work to remain in England. On one occasion her copy of a painting by the Italian artist Salvator Rosa (1615‚Äì1673) sold for more than the original. One of her own designs, the Judgement of Cain, took ten years to complete. Her exhibition in Leicester Square, London, was the first art show to be illuminated by gaslight and innovative theatrical displays with red, silver and gold curtaining and one where it looked like peeping into a cottage window. The exhibition consisted of copies of paintings after such masters as Carlo Dolci, Guido, Ruisdael, Opie, Morland, Gainsborough and Reynolds. Linwood's subjects also included Lady Jane Grey and Napoleon, whose portrait was said to have been done from life. He conferred on her the Freedom of Paris in 1803. So successful was Linwood in these annual shows attracting 40,000 customers a year, similar to Madame Tussauds, that she was able to commission John Hoppner (1758‚Äì1810) to paint her portrait. By this time Hoppner was principal painter to the Prince of Wales (later George IV) and the most important portraitist in England.Ladies Monthly Review spoke of its \\"variety and graduation of tints cannot possibly exceeds in effort by the pencil.\\" John Constable's (1776‚Äì1837) first commissioned work was to paint the background details in one of her works. Linwood is said to have refused an offer of 3000 guineas for her version of Carlo Dolci's Salvator Mundi, and instead bequeathed it to Queen Victoria. The needle work pictures continued to be exhibited in Leicester Square in London continuously until her death in 1845. Charles Dickens mentions her in \\"A Plated Article\\", his description of a visit to Staffordshire, to be found in Reprinted Pieces: \\"Shade of Miss Linwood, erst of Leicester Square, London, thou art welcome here, and thy retreat is fitly chosen! I myself was one of the last visitors to that awful storehouse of thy life's work, where an anchorite old man and woman took my shilling with a solemn wonder, and conducting me to a gloomy sepulchre of needlework dropping to pieces with dust and age and shrouded in twilight at high noon, left me there, chilled, frightened and alone. And now, in ghostly letters on all the dead walls of this dead town, I read thy honoured name, and find that thy Last Supper, worked in Berlin Wool, invites inspection as a powerful excitement!\\" Credited as the most notable needlepainter of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, along with Mary Knowles and Anne Eliza Morritt, and perhaps as few works survive of Mary Delany, embroidery historians unfailingly list Linwood as the artist who inspired the practice of Berlin wool work, today known as needlepoint. Linwood's exhibitions were contemporaneous with the rising popularity of Berlin wool work, until the Royal School of Needlework and the Arts and Crafts movement began to criticize Berlin wool work for having led to a loss of embroidery skills, and in later decades Linwood's notoriety was put in question due to its association with Berlin wool work.Rosika Desnoyers, Pictorial Embroidery in England: A Critical History of Needlepainting and Berlin Work (London: Bloomsbury, 2019). =Legal dispute= Linwood's needlework exhibition was housed in the old Savile House on Leicester Square, which also housed William Green's Pistol Repository and Shooting Gallery from 1836 to 1855 in a rebuilt section upstairs. The run-down building had been leased to Mary Linwood and associates at the turn of the century. It was subsequently rebuilt and refurbished from 1806‚Äì1809 by architect Joseph Page (1718‚Äì1776). Linwood displayed her work in a long gallery on the first floor from 1809 until her death in 1845. A legal dispute regarding the payment for renovations became a decades long battle, and eventually landed in The House of Lords in 1837. The House decided the case against Linwood and her partners, who were ordered to pay Page.Reports of Cases Heard in The House of Lords, p. 400A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600‚Äì1840, Howard Colvin, p. 765. In 1865, Savile House was destroyed by fire. =Family= Mary is often confused with her niece Mary Linwood who was a music composer and wrote a number of literary works including Leicestershire Tales (1808). =Last years and death= Four years before her death in 1845, Mary's works were still exhibited in London. She worked with stitches of different lengths on a fabric made especially for her in Leicester, and had coarse linen tammy cloth prepared for her as well. Her long and short stitches looked like brush strokes, with silk for highlights. She inspired many amateurs in later years to copy her needlework techniques on a smaller scale. Mary embroidered her last piece when she was seventy-eight, although she lived to be ninety and worked as a school mistress until a year before her death. She never married and, according to the Greater Wigston Historical Society, was the last person in Leicester to use a Sedan chair. In 1845, during her annual visit to her Exhibition in London, Mary Linwood, by then regarded as the most celebrated needlewoman of her age, caught the flu and died. She was buried in St Margaret's Church, Leicester, a church she regularly attended. Her entire collection was dispersed at Christie's Auction House, after both the British Museum and House of Lords had earlier rejected her offer to donate her collection, the auctioned pieces were sold for sums far below those at which they had been valued a few years previously. Her tomb in Leicester, erected by friends refers to her skills adding a \\"lustre on her age, her country and her sex.

Circumscribed by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1867, the genus contains seven species that have ear-shaped fruit bodies that grow on the ground. Wynnea species have a worldwide distribution and have been collected from the United States, Costa Rica, India, and China. Taxonomy The genus Wynnea was circumscribed by English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1867 to accommodate the species Wynnea gigantea and Peziza macrotis. The former specimen was collected by Botteri near Orizaba, Mexico, and the latter had been described by Berkeley in his Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany (1851) Both species were subsequently illustrated in Cooke's Micrographia. No other collections of Wynnea were reported for several decades, and in Pier Andrea Saccardo's Sylloge, the genus was reduced to synonymy with the genus Midotis. American mycologist Roland Thaxter described a new species in 1905, W. americana, which was collected in Tennessee. Description The fruit bodies (technically called apothecia) are thick, firm, tough and become almost leathery after drying. Standing erect, the ear-shaped apothecia are several- to many-clustered on a common stalk that arises from a sclerotium, a hardened mass of mycelium buried in the earth. The paraphyses (sterile cells interspersed amongst the asci) are cylindrical, simple or branched. The spore- producing structures, the asci, are cylindrical, and taper to an elongated base that penetrate to underneath the hymenium. Like other members of the family Sarcoscyphaceae, Wynnea species have multinucleate ascospores and paraphyses. The ascus has a thickened apical ring capped by a hinged operculum; its opening often is oriented obliquely, a condition referred to as suboperculate. Three structural components are involved in spore discharge in Wynnea species: the operculum, the suboperculum, and the zone of dehiscence. Collectively, these three structures are known as the apical apparatus. Distribution Wynnea species have a worldwide distribution. They have been collected from several North American locations; in the United States, they have been found in Tennessee, New York, West Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Wynnea species have also been collected in Costa Rica, and India. W. macrospora and W. sinensis are found in Guizhou Province, China. Species Wynnea sparassoides There are eight species described in the genus Wynnea: * W. americana * W. frominda * W. gigantea * W. intermedia * W. macrospora * W. mactrotis : The spoon-shaped apothecia originate from a fleshy, brown, underground sclerotium; the external surface color is brown when fresh, and dark brown on drying; the height may reach . This is one of the original Wynnea species, and was first named Peziza macrotitis when first described in 1851, later named Wynnea macrotis by Berkeley, and then again to Midotis macrotis by Saccardo in 1889.

This uncommon inedible species is recognizable by its spoon-shaped or rabbit-ear shaped fruit bodies that may reach up to tall. It has dark brown and warty outer surfaces, while the fertile spore-bearing inner surface is orange to pinkish to reddish brown. The fruit bodies grow clustered together from large underground masses of compacted mycelia known as sclerotia. In eastern North America, where it is typically found growing in the soil underneath hardwood trees, it is found from New York to Michigan south to Mexico. The species has also been collected from Costa Rica, India, and Japan. Wynnea americana is distinguished from other species in the genus Wynnea by the pustules (small bumps) on the outer surface, and microscopically by the large asymmetrical longitudinally ribbed spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings at one end that are capped by a hinged structure known as the operculum‚Äîa lid that is opened when spores are to be released from the ascus. History and taxonomy Wynnea americana was first described in 1905 by American mycologist Roland Thaxter. Thaxter found several clusters of fruit bodies in Burbank, Tennessee in 1888, and believed the fungus to be Wynnea macrotis, one of the first identified species of genus Wynnea. An 1896 visit to the same location as well as Cranberry, North Carolina yielded further specimens. This time, however, Thaxter noticed that the fruit bodies were not attached to humus, as expected, but rather to \\"a large, irregularly lobed, brown, firm, tuber-like body buried a few inches deep in the humus.\\" Microscopic examination of this structure and other tissue of the fruit body convinced Thaxter the material was sufficiently different from known Wynnea species to justify the creation of a new species. Both the Tennessee and the North Carolina specimens were used as syntypes to describe the taxon; the Tennessee specimen has since been designated the lectotype (the name-bearing type specimen). In 1946, French mycologist Marcelle Louise Fernande Le Gal determined that the ascus in W. americana was similar in structure to those species he placed in the suboperculate series. The common names for W. americana are \\"moose antlers\\", or \\"rabbit ears\\". Description Young fruit bodies in West Virginia, USA The fruit bodies (technically called apothecia) of W. americana are erect and spoon- or ear-shaped, and may reach up to tall by wide with the edges usually rolled inward. The outside surface is dark brown, while the inner surface‚Äîthe spore-bearing hymenium‚Äîis pinkish orange to dull purplish red or brown at maturity. The outer surface may develop wrinkles in maturity. The apothecia, which occur singly or in groups of up to about 25, arise from a short stalk. The stalk is variable in length and solid, dark outside, white within. The stalks originate from a sclerotium, a compact mass of hardened mycelium. The sclerotium has an almost gelatinous consistency with irregularly shaped lobes and internal chambers, and may reach a diameter of . The sclerotium's function is thought to supply moisture and nutrients, or to serve as a resistant structure capable of sustaining the fungus through times of stress. W. macrotis is the only other species in the genus to bear a sclerotium. Wynnea americana has no discernible odor, and its taste is unknown. It has been described as inedible due to its toughness. =Microscopic characteristics= Microscopic features of W. americana. Figures 3, 6 and 7 are the spores of: (3) W. americana, (6) W. macrotis and (7) W. gigantea. With many cup fungi, microscopic analysis of the anatomy and structure of the apothecium is necessary for accurate identification of species, or to help distinguish between related species that have a similar external appearance. In W. americana, the ectal excipulum (the outer layer of tissue comprising the apothecia) is 125 ¬µm thick, and composed of dark angular to roughly spherical cells that are 40‚Äì70 ¬µm in diameter. The angular cells form pyramidal warts on the outer surface. The medullary excipulum (the inner fleshy layer of tissue underneath the ectal excipulum) is almost gelatinous, composed of interwoven hyphae 10 ¬µm in diameter. Several structural components are involved in spore discharge in W. americana, such as the ascus, the operculum, the suboperculum. The spore-bearing cells, the asci, are 330‚Äì400 ¬µm long by 16‚Äì20 ¬µm wide. The ascus has a thickened apical ring that is capped by a hinged operculum, a lid that is opened when spores are to be released from the ascus. The presence of the apical ring beneath the operculum and the slanted opening that results is a condition known as \\"suboperculate\\", and is shared with Cookeina tricholoma and Phillipsia domingensis, also in the family Sarcoscyphaceae. The spores are scaphoid (boat-shaped), and have dimensions of 35‚Äì38 by 12‚Äì14 ¬µm. They are marked with prominent longitudinal grooves, and when mature, are apiculate (ending abruptly in a short point). The spores typically contain several oil droplets. The paraphyses (sterile cells interspersed among the asci) are 8‚Äì9 ¬µm long and have internal partitions called septa. The structure of the septa has been investigated using transmission electron microscopy, which has revealed that W. americana has a single pore plugged by a \\"fan-shaped matrix\\"‚Äîan electron-dense region with a torus-shaped ring of translucent tissue wrapped around it. The pore plug resembles those found in the Sarcoscyphaceae species Sarcoscypha occidentalis and Phillipsia domingensis. =Similar species= The closely related Wynnea sparassoides, known in the vernacular as the \\"stalked cauliflower fungus\\", has a fruit body resembling a yellow-brown cauliflower atop a long brown stem. In comparison to W. americana, W. gigantea has apothecia that are smaller, more rounded at the tips, more numerous in a single specimen, and paler in color. Donald H. Pfister, in his 1979 monograph on the genus Wynnea, suggests that the pustulate appearance of the outer surface clearly distinguishes W. americana from the other species in the genus. Habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of Wynnea americana grow solitarily or in clusters on the ground in deciduous forests, and prefer moist, organic soils. In both Asia and North America, fruit bodies are most often produced during August and September. The single Central American collection, from Costa Rica, was made in early November. In North America, Wynnea americana has been collected from several locations, including Tennessee, New York, West Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. It has also been collected in Costa Rica, India, Mexico, and Japan.

It was released on the Exclusive Records label in 1946. It was covered a year later by Etta Jones with J. C. Heard and his Orchestra and released on RCA Victor. Patti LaBelle and Her Blue Belles In 1962, the Chicago-based girl group the Starlets were riding high with their top forty single, \\"Better Tell Him No\\". That year, while on tour, they were convinced by Newtown Records president Harold Robinson to appear in a recording schedule where they recorded two songs. One of these songs was \\"I Sold My Heart to the Junkman\\". After recording the songs, Robinson released the song on his label but instead of crediting the Starlets, credited a Philadelphia-based girl group named The Ordettes, who had changed their name to The Blue Belles - after a threat from another record boss, the name was altered to Patti LaBelle and Her Blue Belles. The song eventually reached number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 thanks to promotion of the song by the Blue Belles, who made their first television appearance on American Bandstand in mid-1962. It is unknown as to whether Robinson erased the original lead vocal from the song and added in Patti LaBelle's lead vocal, or whether the Starlets themselves were replaced by session singers. Nevertheless, the Starlets' manager sued Robinson for ownership of the song, with the girls each winning $5,000 from the suit. Despite this, however, it is still not clear as to how the song was released. Ironically when the Blue Belles recorded their own version shortly before promoting it, both the Starlets and Blue Belles' versions were strikingly similar. The Starlets did not fully recover from the \\"Junkman\\" scandal and after a half-year of new recordings, disbanded in 1963. Meanwhile, the newly christened Patti LaBelle and the Blue Belles went on to national fame that year with their hit, \\"Down the Aisle (The Wedding Song)\\". In 1962, Lyn Cornell released her cover of the song with Jack Good's eccentric production. Despite gaining airplay on the BBC Light Programme, it did not match her earlier UK Singles Chart appearance with \\"Never on Sunday\\".

The theorem was first published by , in both the form stated above and an equivalent complementary form: every infinite graph contains either a countably infinite clique or an independent set with equal cardinality to the whole graph. In their paper, they credited Paul Erd≈ës with assistance in its proof. They applied these results to the comparability graphs of partially ordered sets to show that each partial order contains either a countably infinite antichain or a chain of cardinality equal to the whole order, and that each partial order contains either a countably infinite chain or an antichain of cardinality equal to the whole order. The same theorem can also be stated as a result in set theory, using the arrow notation of , as \\\\kappa\\\\rightarrow(\\\\kappa,\\\\alef_0)^2. This means that, for every set S of cardinality \\\\kappa, and every partition of the ordered pairs of elements of S into two subsets P_1 and P_1, there exists either a subset S_1\\\\subset S of cardinality \\\\kappa or a subset S_2\\\\subset S of cardinality \\\\alef_0, such that all pairs of elements of S_i belong to P_i. Here, P_1 can be interpreted as the edges of a graph having S as its vertex set, in which S_1 (if it exists) is a clique of cardinality \\\\kappa, and S_2 (if it exists) is a countably infinite independent set.

In October 1956 during the 1956 elections, the National Socialist Party headed by Nabulsi won a plurality of 16 out of 40 seats in the Jordanian House of Representatives. Subsequently, King Hussein asked him to form a government; it was the only elected government in Jordan's history. Nabulsi's government was short-lived. His policies as Prime Minister frequently clashed with that of King Hussein's. Nabulsi wanted Jordan to move closer to Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser, but Hussein wanted it to stay in the Western camp. Disagreements between the monarchy and the leftist government culminated after Nabulsi provided Hussein with an expanded list of officers in the army he wanted to dismiss. Nabulsi was forced to resign in March 1957. Early life Nabulsi was born in Salt, Jordan in 1908, during the Ottoman period. The ancestors of the Nabulsi family were Arabs from central Syria who originally served as members of the elite Ottoman sipahi units that were sent on a 1657 expedition to bring Jabal Nablus under centralized Ottoman rule. The family soon became part of the merchant class in Nablus, hence their name Nabulsi (\\"from Nablus\\").Doumani, 1995, p. 37 and p. 272. Suleiman Nabulsi graduated from the American University of Beirut with a degree in law and social studies in the early 1930s. Afterward, he briefly served as a teacher in Karak where he generated a \\"feeling of Arab brotherhood,\\" leading the first demonstration in the city condemning the Balfour Declaration. As a result, the British authorities in the country immediately transferred him to a secondary school in his hometown of Salt. He moved to Amman in 1932. He later joined the civil service and eventually became the director of the state-owned Agricultural Bank, a post he held until 1946. In 1945, British authorities accused him of agitating in Jerusalem against a concession to a Jewish company. Upon his return to Jordan, he was arrested at the Allenby Bridge, then forcibly moved to Shoubak in southern Jordan. Political career King Hussein with PM Suleiman Nabulsi From 1947 to 1949, Nabulsi served as Minister of Finance and Economy, then again from 1950 to 1951. He was jailed for nine months in the Amman Prison for writing an article condemning the 1948 Anglo- Jordanian treaty. However, like most politicians of the time, his opposition activities did not hinder his political career. When he entered into the government as finance minister in 1950, King Abdullah bestowed him on the title of \\"Pasha.\\" In 1953, he was appointed Jordan's ambassador to Britain until 1954 when he returned to Amman from London. His experience there turned him into a staunch Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist. His nationalism had alienated him from King Hussein who had him exiled from the capital Amman to a provincial town. At this time, he founded the National Socialist Party (NSP) and was elected its leader. He soon became known by many of his supporters as Za'im al-Watani (\\"The Nationalist Leader\\"). In July 1956, Nabulsi gave a speech commending Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser for nationalizing the Suez Canal and stressing the importance of Nasser's leadership of the Arab world. Nabulsi entered his party into an electoral alliance with the Jordanian Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party and Jordanian Communist Party to form the National Front (NF) which called for freeing Jordan of foreign influence, political, economic, and military cooperation with Arab nationalist states, and aiding other Arab states with their fight against imperialism. They failed in their attempt to gain a majority in the 40-member Jordanian parliament, allegedly due to poll rigging by King Hussein's allies. However, they did win twelve seats, making it the largest bloc, and as leader of the NF, Nabulsi managed to prevent Jordan from entering the Central Treaty Organization (Baghdad Pact) alliance in 1955, then succeeded in getting Hussein to dissolve the parliament. =Prime Minister of Jordan= Nabulsi with Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser in Cairo while heading the Jordanian delegation to the Arab Parliament Conference, 1968 Suleiman Nabulsi smoking, October 1956. In the October 1956 parliamentary elections, the NF won 16 seats and Nabulsi was asked by Hussein to form a government. Thus, he became prime minister and as one of his first measures, he merged the Arab Legion with the Palestinian- dominated National Guard, creating a 35,000-strong Jordanian Army. Two days after his ascension to government, Egypt was invaded by a tripartite alliance consisting of Britain, France, and Israel. While an enraged King Hussein favored militarily assisting Egypt, Nabulsi called for a delay to wait for the results of the invasion. Eventually, Hussein agreed not to help militarily. Nabulsi also decided to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and allowed the Communist Party to publish a weekly newspaper. However, on 2 February 1957, the king warned against this in a speech directed to Nabulsi, saying \\"We want this country to be inaccessible to Communist propaganda and Bolshevik theories.\\"Lesch, pp.125-126. Heeding to Hussein's request, Nabulsi ordered the Communist Party organ to be banned. Nabulsi was known to be an admirer of Nasser, and so called for Jordan to join an Arab federation with Egypt and Syria thereby reducing King Hussein to a figurehead. Relations between the cabinet and the king were further strained when Hussein dispatched personal envoys to Cairo, Damascus, and Jeddah in March 1957 with messages not vetted by the government. In response, Nabulsi presented the king with formal requests to retire senior public servants, threatening his cabinet would resign and take to the streets if the requests were refused. Hussein initially appealed, but after Nabulsi prepared a new list, Hussein sent him a letter warning him that he would be dismissed. On 8 April, an army brigade commanded by Nader Rashid, an Arab nationalist officer, departed from its garrison in Zarqa ‚Äî under orders from the nationalist chief of staff, Ali Abu Nuwar, and without authorization from Hussein ‚Äî and positioned itself to control the access road to the capital Amman. Upon hearing of the brigade's movements, Hussein ordered they retreat back to their base, to which they complied. Hussein viewed Nuwar and Rashid's actions as part of a conspiracy to topple him and enter a union with the United Arab Republic. Two days later, Nabulsi was pressured to hand in his resignation by senior royalist officials, which he did.Dann, p. 55. On April 15, a new cabinet was formed by Fakhri al-Khalidi and Nabulsi was given the post of foreign minister. Tensions between Arab nationalist and royalist officers began to increase as did public unrest, with nationalists and leftists demanding the reinstatement of Nabulsi as Prime Minister and royalists and Islamists backing Hussein. On 22 April, Nabulsi attended the Patriotic Congress in Nablus, which brought together opponents of the monarchy. The conference called for a federation with the United Arab Republic, the establishment of a 16-member presidential council, a purge of \\"traitors and conspiratorial (sic elements)\\" and a general strike to pressure Hussein. Upon pressure from the army, under complete control of the royalists after Abu Nuwar's exile by Hussein a few days prior, Nabulsi handed in his resignation for a second time on 23 April. Mass protests in the West Bank and Amman ensued the next day demanding his return. Hussein declared martial law on 25 April;Dann, pp. 60-61. all political parties were banned and Nabulsi was put under house arrest without being charged. He was pardoned by Hussein and released on 13 August 1961.Oron, Yitzhak. Middle East Record Volume 2, 1961. The Moshe Dayan Center. p. 357.

It is mainly used in the fields of chemistry and biology. A shaker contains an oscillating board that is used to place the flasks, beakers, or test tubes. Although the magnetic stirrer has lately come to replace the shaker, it is still the preferred choice of equipment when dealing with large volume substances or when simultaneous agitation is required.  Types of shakers = Vortex shaker = Invented by Jack A. Kraft and Harold D. Kraft in 1962, a vortex shaker is a usually small device used to shake or mix small vials of liquid substance. Its most standout characteristic is that it works by the user putting a vial on the shaking platform and turning it on; thus, the vial is shaken along with the platform. A vortex shaker is very variable in terms of speed adjustment, for the shaking speed can be continuously changed while shaking by turning a switch. = Platform shaker = A platform shaker has a table board that oscillates horizontally. The liquids to be stirred are held in beakers, jars, or erlenmeyer flasks that are placed over the table or, sometimes, in test tubes or vials that are nested into holes in the plate. Platform shakers can also be combined with other systems like rotating mixers for small systems and have been designed to be manufactured in laboratories themselves with open source scientific equipment. = Orbital shaker = An orbital shaker has a circular shaking motion with a slow speed (25-500 rpm). It is suitable for culturing microbes, washing blots, and general mixing. Some of its characteristics are that it does not create vibrations, and it produces low heat compared to other kinds of shakers, which makes it ideal for culturing microbes. Moreover, it can be modified by placing it in an incubator to create an incubator shaker due to its low temperature and vibrations. = Incubator shaker = An incubator shaker (or thermal shaker) can be considered a mix of an incubator and a shaker. It has an ability to shake while maintaining optimal conditions for incubating microbes or DNA replications. This equipment is very useful since, in order for a cell to grow, it needs oxygen and nutrients that require shaking so that they can be distributed evenly around the culture. A vortex shaker in use. Anyone employing an incubator shaker (thermal shaker) to grow yeast or bacteria in the laboratory needs to beware that under the usual conditions encountered in the lab, the rate at which oxygen diffuses from the gaseous phase into the shaken liquid phase is too slow to keep up with the rate at which the oxygen is consumed by for example E coli dividing every half hour or S cerevisiae dividing every hour. If the investigator measure the oxygen in the shake flask on the shaker -- polarographically, for example -- at mid-exponential phase of growth, the dissolved oxygen concentration will turn out to be zero.

Its roots lie in the overall objective of The Energy Conservation Act of 2001. The mission document, which was approved in 2010, established the immense energy efficiency potential of India, which was about Rs. 74,000 crores. The Mission, upon its complete execution, envisages to achieve total avoided capacity addition of 19,598 MW, fuel savings of around 23 million tonnes per year and green house gas emissions reductions of 98.55 million tonnes per year. A recent World Bank study has estimated the country's energy efficiency market to be at 1.6 lakh crores.  Background  The Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change, Government of India, launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) on 30 June 2008. NAPCC is a multi-pronged approach with eight underlined missions focusing on energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources and sustainability. NAPCC recognizes energy efficiency as an important lever to address the issue of climate change. The National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) is aimed to promote the market for energy efficiency by fostering innovative policies and effective market instruments. The mission has its roots in The Energy Conservation Act, which was enacted in 2001 to adopt principles of efficiency and conservation in the use of energy resources. The Energy Conservation Act led to the creation of a statutory body, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) with dedicated powers and responsibilities to promote energy efficiency and conservation in different sectors of the economy. NMEEE furthers the objective of The Energy Conservation Act by focusing on enhanced energy efficiency measures with four specific initiatives under its overall ambit. The Ministry of Power, Government of India, through Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), looks over the progress of the NMEEE mission.  Initiatives planned under NMEEE  NMEEE includes four specific energy efficiency initiatives under its umbrella. These enhanced energy efficiency measures are aimed at facilitating energy intensive industries (industries that consume large quantities of energy in production process) to reduce their energy footprint and catalyze investments in the energy efficiency sector. * Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT): Assigning energy reduction targets to large energy intensive industries and distributing Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts) on achievement of the targets. These ESCerts can then be traded. * Market Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE): Promoting adoption of energy efficient equipments and appliances through innovative business models. * Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP): Increasing the confidence of financial institutions and investors to support energy efficiency initiatives. * Framework for Energy Efficiency Economic Development (FEEED): Promoting energy efficiency initiatives by hedging against investment risks. The below schematic summarizes the objectives of these enhanced energy efficiency initiatives. A snapshot of the four initiatives under the NMEEE. A snapshot of the four initiatives under the NMEEE = Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) = Industry consumes about 40-45% of the total final energy consumption in India, making it the largest sector in terms of contribution to the energy and environment footprint of the country. Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme under the NMEEE mission is a regulatory instrument, which provides an innovative market based mechanism to reduce the energy footprint of the industry sector. Energy intensive industries are selected and assigned targets for reduction in specific energy consumption with a provision of obtaining energy saving certificates which can be traded. The Energy Conservation Act, 2001 provides power to the Central Government to specify any industry as a \\"Designated Consumer\\" based on its energy consumption or energy efficiency potential. PAT Scheme makes it mandatory for these designated consumers to participate in the program and achieve the desired targets for specific energy reduction within the period of three years. At the end of three years, the energy savings achieved by the industries are verified by a team of Accredited Energy Auditors who are appointed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency. Once the energy savings are verified, Energy Savings Certificates (ESCerts) are issued to the designated consumers by the Ministry of Power, Govt. of India. These ESCerts are then eligible for trading at the two Power Exchanges vis-a-vis Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) and Power Exchange India Limited (PXIL) or can also be sold to the designated consumers who are not able to meet their energy savings targets. PAT Scheme also lays down the provision of penalty for those designated consumers who are unable to meet the desired targets after implementation of measures and purchase of ESCerts.  PAT Status and Achievements  PAT Cycle I - The first phase of the PAT Cycle was executed from 2012-13 to 2014‚Äì15. In this phase, 478 number of Designated Consumers (DCs) were selected for reduction of their specific energy consumption. These DCs covered the eight most energy intensive sectors which included Aluminium, Cement, Chlor- Alkali, Fertilizer, Iron & Steel, Paper & Pulp, Thermal Power Plant and Textile. The targets rolled out under the first phase were equivalent to 6.68 million tonne of oil equivalent (toe) whereas the actual savings were reported as 8.67 mtoe which amount to INR 9,500 crores of monetary value. Apart from the energy savings, PAT Cycle - I resulted in 31 million tonnes of CO2 emission reductions and yielded investments of INR 24,500 crores in energy efficiency. PAT Cycle II - The second phase of the PAT Cycle was rolled out for the period from 2016-17 to 2018‚Äì19. The phase was expanded to include new designated consumers from the earlier eight sectors and three new sectors- Railway, Refineries and Distribution Companies (DISCOMs), taking the total to 621 DCs. The second phase of PAT has an estimated target savings of 8.87 mtoe. PAT Cycle III - The third phase will be rolled out for the period from 2017-18 - 2019-20 and aims to reduce the energy consumption in 116 new designated consumers. The estimated target savings for the third phase is of the order of 1.06 mtoe by 2019‚Äì20. = Market Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE) = The objective of this initiative is to enhance the adoption of energy efficient equipment and appliances by developing innovative business models that improves their affordability. The initiative focuses on coordination among multiple stakeholders to ensure the development of technologies that leapfrog the existing low efficiency and quality standards and deliver enhanced energy savings and emission reductions. Two programs that were developed under this scheme include: * Bachat Lamp Yojana (BLY): The Bachat Lamp Yojana scheme was launched in 2009 to promote the adoption of Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFLs) in place of the incandescent lamps. This was achieved by offering the CFLs at the same cost as the incandescents to consumers. The scheme, since its inception in 2009, has undergone continuous advancements and modifications. In 2015, the incumbent government rebranded the Energy Efficiency Lighting Program to Domestic Efficient Lighting Program. On 1 May 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) program, replacing the Bachat Lamp Yojana scheme, to promote the use of more efficient LED lighting for households. * Super Efficient Equipment Program (SEEP): The Super Efficient Equipment Program aims to improve the energy efficiency of domestic sector by promoting the development of super efficient appliances. Under this program, the manufacturers are incentivized by the government to incorporate the technology advancements and elevate the efficiency standards of the equipment. BEE launched the program in the XII five-year plan with a focus on ceiling fans, considering its wide use and impact on domestic energy consumption. = Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP) = The Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP) initiative of the NMEEE mission is intended towards catalysing the finances for energy efficiency sector by addressing the barriers and challenges in market development and project implementation. It provides a platform for financial institutions, investors and project developers to engage in knowledge exchange on energy related aspects and thus increase their confidence in supporting energy conservation and efficiency projects. Under this initiative, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency has signed MoUs with M/s. PTC India Ltd, M/s. SIDBI, HSBC Bank, Tata Capital and IFCI Ltd to promote financing for energy efficiency projects. An MoU has also been signed with the Indian Banks Association for conducting training programs for scheduled commercial banks to develop a better understanding on energy efficiency financing and thus expedite the projects. = Framework for Energy Efficient Economic Development (FEEED) = The Framework for Energy Efficient Economic Development (FEEED) initiative of the NMEEE mission addresses the concerns of risk averse banks and investors through innovative fiscal instruments. Under this initiative, BEE institutionalized two types of funds in order to protect the confidence of banks and investors in energy efficiency projects and to avoid the stalling of projects due to lack of funds. * Partial Risk Guarantee Fund for Energy Efficiency (PRGFEE): This fund is intended to support the banks and investors offering loans for implementation of energy efficiency projects. The fund guarantees a risk cover of 50% loan amount or INR 10 crore per project, whichever is less. * Venture Capital Fund for Energy Efficiency (VCFEE): This fund is intended towards promoting equity financing in the energy efficiency sector and thus reducing the impact of non-availability of debt financing to small size companies and projects. The fund provides last mile equity support for successful implementation of energy efficiency projects. This is equivalent to INR 2 crore or 15% of total equity whichever is less.

History of the Armenians. Translation and commentary by Robert W. Thomson. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1978, I.12. After the demise of Urartu it passed into the hands of successive regional kingdoms and empires. =Medieval= The lands around Manzikert belonged to the Manavazyans, an Armenian nakharar family which claimed descent from Manaz, until AD 333, when King Khosrov III Arshakuni of Armenia ordered that all members of the family be put to the sword. He later awarded the lands to another family, the Aghbianosyans. Manzikert was a fortified town,Leiser, Gary. \\"Manzikert\\" in Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia. Josef W. Meri (ed.)

Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 1976. Manzikert was the site of the Council of Manzikert in 726. After the Armenian revolt of 771-772, the Abbasid government encouraged the migration of Arab tribes to the region, which resulted in the settling of Arab tribes near Malazgirt. In 968, the Byzantine general Bardas Phokas captured Manzikert, which was incorporated into the Byzantine katepanate of Basprakania (Vaspurakan).Ter-Ghewondyan. Arab Emirates, p. 115. In 1054, the Seljuk Turks made an attempt to capture the city but were repulsed by the city's garrison under the command of Basil Apocapes. The Battle of Manzikert was fought near the town in August 1071. In one of the most decisive defeats in Byzantine history, the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan defeated and captured Emperor Romanus Diogenes, which led to the ethnic and religious transformation of Armenia and Anatolia and the establishment of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and later the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey. The Seljuks pillaged Manzikert itself, killed much of its population and burned the city to the ground. It was successively part of Ahlatshahs (their rule was briefly interrupted by the Kingdom of Georgia), Ayyubids, Sultanate of Rum, Ilkhanids, Karakoyunlu, Timurids, Akkoyunlu and Safavids before Ottoman rule. =Modern= In April 1903, Manzikert was the location of an earthquake which has killed about 3500 people and demolished around 12.000 buildings. In 1915 Manzikert was part of Bitlis Vilayet and had a population of 5,000, the great majority of them Armenians. The city's economy revolved around the cultivation of grain, trade and the production of handicrafts. There existed two Armenian churches, Yerek Khoran Surb Astvatsatsin (Three Altars Holy Mother of God) and Surb Gevork (St. George, called St. Sergius by H. F. B. Lynch),H. F. B. Lynch.

Based on a novel by Marcia Davenport and a screenplay by Isobel Lennart, the film was produced by Voldemar Vetluguin, directed by Mervyn LeRoy and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot Just after World War II, socialite Jessie Bourne is home alone one night in her Gramercy Park apartment on New York's East Side when she receives a mysterious phone call that hangs up. Her wealthy playboy husband Brandon is out, enjoying himself at the Del Rio night club. At the night club, young model Rosa Senta admonishes Brandon for going out alone, as Rosa admires Jessie, who has been a customer at the dress salon where Rosa works. Brandon tries to mollify Rosa, but he is cut short when Brandon's former mistress, gold-digging Isabel Lorrison, arrives. She has returned from Paris intent on rekindling her romance with Brandon, but he rebuffs her, professing faithfulness to his wife. An argument ensues in which Isabel's date, wealthy Alec Dawning, knowing Brandon's reputation, knocks him unconscious. Brandon is rescued by Rosa, who takes him to her home to recover. Brandon eventually returns home in the wee hours to find Jessie waiting up. He tells her that he was working late, stopped for a drink, was knocked out by a drunk, and then rescued by Rosa. He also explains how Rosa knows her. The next morning, Jessie's friend, Helen Lee, calls on her, presumably to remind her of the Lees' party that night for an intelligence officer and ex-NYPD cop, Mark Dwyer, returning to the U.S. from post-war service in Italy. Both women have seen the morning newspaper in which the nightclub brawl is front-page news. After much prodding, Jessie confesses to Helen that she is afraid of what will happen to her marriage with Isabel back in town. Jessie says she intends to live her life normally, including going shopping. She decides to go to the dress salon where Rosa works to hear for herself what transpired at the club. Once there, Jessie takes Rosa aside to thank her for rescuing Brandon. Rosa confirms Brandon's story, which is a relief to Jessie. As thanks, Jessie offers to take Rosa to LaGuardia Airport to pick up Mark Dwyer, on whom Rosa has had a long-standing crush. As he is leaving his office for Helen's party, Brandon is visited by Isabel, who manages to entice him to her apartment. Jessie goes to the Lees‚Äô party alone when Brandon is a no-show and becomes better acquainted with Mark. Mark explains the crush Rosa has on him and that she would have gotten over it long ago except that he was overseas. Jessie finds out that Brandon is with Isabel and begins to leave the party; Mark, tired of being celebrated throughout the day for his return to the States, and falling hard for Jessie, offers to escort her home. They talk, and he remains with her until Brandon returns. After Mark leaves, and although they argue viciously, Brandon convinces Jessie of his love. They make up, and he proposes a trip to Virginia. The next day, while explaining to Rosa that they can't be in a relationship, and that he's interested in Jessie, Mark spots Alec with an imposing, frosty blonde on his arm. So, although Isabel is being kept by Alec, he is not faithful to her. As she prepares to go out with Mark for a drive, Jessie is telephoned by Isabel, who asks her for a meeting at her apartment in Greenwich Village on the West Side. Mark unwittingly drives Jessie there, and while doing so, admits his attraction to her, but he is resigned to her trying to save her marriage. During the showdown at the apartment, Jessie refuses to back down even after Isabel gloats that, if she calls, Brandon ‚Äúwill come running.‚Äù Mark takes Jessie home where she is given a message to call Brandon‚Äîat Isabel's apartment. Suspecting she has been duped by her husband, Jessie calls. Brandon answers, telling her that he found Isabel murdered and that he has summoned the police. Before Jessie and Mark go to the apartment, Mark discovers he had just delivered Jessie there earlier. A friend of Mark's, Lt. Jake Jacobi, is in charge of the crime scene. There, Mark introduces Jessie to Jake, and they are admitted to the apartment. While Jake questions Brandon and Jessie, Mark finds a woman's broken fingernail next to the body. After confirming the nail is not Jessie's or Isabel's, and mindful of all he has seen since his return, Mark asks Jake to let him do a little detecting. While Jake takes Brandon 'downtown' for further questioning, Jessie is allowed to go home. Mark heads to Alec's private party at the Del Rio club. Using a ruse, he determines that Alec's jealous girlfriend, Felice Backett, the frosty blonde, committed the murder. Mark takes her to the police station, and Brandon is released. Brandon returns to Jessie in their high-rise apartment, but she finally realizes that she no longer loves him and leaves. Brandon ponders what will happen next as he looks out over New York City.

Ownership passed to the Alsatian industrial group \\"Info Reality\\" for 3 years from 1998, before the present CEO Tony Fasciglione bought up the company with the help of several banks. In 2005 smaller new premises were built several miles south of Strasbourg in Ostwald to better suit its needs, as production had been transferred to the Far East several years before. A new complementary section of consultants specialised in professional Video surveillance (CCTV) and Public address systems (CGV Systeme) joined the company in 2002. At present the development of new products is a joint venture with various small firms in the Far East.  Products  The first products invented were video adapters/RF modulators to let people connect a Game console to the aerial input of their TV set. This was before the advent of SCART sockets on TVs. Then came adapters (the REP range) for the Canal+ Decoder which arrived in 1983. After that there were colour transcoders PAL- SECAM and SECAM-PAL, a balanced line video transmission system for the home (the Visiline), and then the wireless video transmitters (Freeline) and remote control relays (Zapline). There were all sorts of RF video modulators (Moduline) too. For the last six years the main product has been the Premio, and now Etimo range of Set-top box or Digital TV adapters, since by the end of 2011 France has finished changing entirely to Digital TV. In 2010 CGV added to its product line two HD Digital Sat receivers Set-top box, (Premio Sat HD-W TNTSAT) and (E-Sat HD-W FRANSAT) with recording of Satellite television channels on an external USB hard drive, and Powerline communication systems named (CPLine 2B), (CPline WiFi) and (CPLine AV-HD).  Company Policies  Innovation is an essential part of the domestic video market, and CGV commercializes several new products every year. However the brand CGV has been associated with quality in the French market since early days in the 1980s when all Research and Development (R&D;) was done in Strasbourg. Since production has moved to the Far East, CGV has introduced corresponding levels of Quality control. The design of a new product is developed, checked and improved by the R&D; Lab at the HQ in Strasbourg. Once production has begun, there are three levels of inspection: in the Far East, first on the production lines, and then by a CGV inspector before shipment to Europe; on arrival at CGV in Strasbourg samples of the new products are then re-checked. The principal retail outlets in France are the hypermarkets and superstores.  Increased Web presence  The first web site of CGV with its Online shop was launched in 1999. A new more pro-active version was launched in June 2009. In June 2008 the CGV Forum was launched for users to provide feedback on products. Press articles on the latest CGV products in French can be found in this forum under the heading Actualites.  Acronym for CGV in French  A Google search for CGV with pages in French often comes up with Conditions Generales de Vente (General Sales Conditions) which hinders a search for the company CGV of this article. However associating CGV with \\"TNT\\" (Television Numerique Terrestre i.e. DVB-T), \\"video\\", or one of its product lines such as \\"Premio\\" or \\"Etimo\\" brings up several useful links.

The station is also designed to serve the crowded and mostly residential community that surrounds the site. History South Bank was opened in 1977, as a stop on the then-new South Busway, which served as the final connection point to the Overbrook line before reaching South Hills Junction, since the streetcar line left the busway at this point and crossed Route 51. In 1993, the Overbrook line was suspended, and the stop became a bus-only stop. Rail service returned when the Overbrook line was rebuilt in 2004, and was the only stop on the once shared portion of the busway to return as a rail-busway connection point.

Background  Since April 2009, the German forces in northern Afghanistan had been under pressure from the Taliban and the Islamic Jihad Union. The attack on the German forces after the visit of chancellor Angela Merkel on April 7, 2009 and the following months showed that the Taliban and their allies exerted heavy pressure to try and force the German troops out of Afghanistan, since involvement in the conflict has been controversial in Germany. The ISAF and Afghan forces began an offensive to reinforce the control and security of Kunduz Province before the Afghan presidential election in August 2009, and reduce pressure on the German forces before the German federal election in September. A second focus was to free the routes into Afghanistan from Uzbekistan, since it was planned to change the supply routes for ISAF to a route from Uzbekistan. The ISAF planned to change its focus to rebuilding, after the Taliban had left the province. For the attack, 800 Afghan soldiers and 100 Afghan policemen were placed in the province. The Bundeswehr prepared its Quick Reaction Force (QRF), equipped with Marder infantry fighting vehicles, Fuchs and Dingo APCs, as well as mortars. The ground troops were supported by the United States Air Force (USAF) and its MQ-1 Predator and Fairchild A-10 close air support aircraft.  The Operation  The first attack on Taliban positions started on the morning of July 19. German forces supported by Marder armoured vehicles and mortars attacked the Taliban. The following day Camp Marmal was under attack by rockets, during a counter-attack by the USAF five Taliban were killed. The Afghan forces reported that they had control of the province on July 23. On July 24 a German patrol came under fire, one vehicle was damaged. On July 31, German troops captured Qari Abdul Wadoud, the leader of the Taliban in the Imam Sahib District. On August 1 it was reported that Taliban forces reconquered the area in the Chahar Dara District of southern Kunduz.  Aftermath  Operation Oqab was the first German ground force offensive since the creation of the Bundeswehr and the first German ground attack since World War II. The commander of the QRF, Hans-Christoph Grohmann, introduced one of his Officers as \\"the first Oberleutnant to lead an Infantry Company in to battle since 1945\\" to the press.

Early years Danny Faragher's early years were filled with music. He took to it at a very young age and music played an important role in his childhood. In 1965, he and brother, Jimmy Faragher, still in their teens, cut their first records, with Danny's band, the Mark Five, releasing three singles with Impression Records. The Peppermint Trolley Company From these garage band beginnings, they evolved into The Peppermint Trolley Company, one of the progenitors of the West Coast Harmony Sound, which was blossoming in the late Sixties. Their music style is now referred to as sunshine pop, psychedelic rock, or baroque pop. With fellow members, Greg Tornquist and Casey Cunningham, and working with producer Dan Dalton, the Peppermint Trolley Company had a national hit - ‚ÄúBaby You Come Rollin‚Äô Across My Mind‚Äú, and released the album, The Peppermint Trolley Company. In addition to his vocal contributions, Faragher was an early user of the clavinet, and played original counter melodies on the trombone. In 1968 the PTC made numerous TV appearances, including The Beverly Hillbillies, Mannix, Dick Clark's Happening '68, Upbeat and The Donald O'Connor Show. In early ‚Äô69, they recorded the original The Brady Bunch theme song. Bones In 1969 Danny, Jimmy, Greg and Casey walked away from their contract with Acta and changed their name to Bones. Within a couple of years, they emerged with a harder rock sound infused with elements of funk and soul music. Danny moved to the B3 organ. Hooking up with producers, Richard Perry and Vini Poncia, Bones cut two albums: Bones on the Signpost label, and Waitin‚Äô Here on MCA and had a hit with ‚ÄúRoberta‚Äù. In ‚Äô72 the band added Patrick McClure on second guitar. The Faragher Brothers After Bones disbanded in 1973, Danny and Jimmy formed the blue-eyed soul group The Faragher Brothers, teaming up with younger brothers Tommy Faragher and Davey Faragher. The brothers released four albums, The Faragher Brothers and Family Ties, both on ABC Records, and Open Your Eyes and The Faraghers, both on Polydor Records. Open Your Eyes and The Faraghers featured younger siblings Pammy Faragher and Marty Faragher. The band charted with the single \\"Stay the Night\\" in ‚Äô79. The group appeared on American Bandstand and Soul Train, and shared the stage with Rufus and War before calling it quits in 1980. Later years Danny has written and performed music for the television sitcoms, The Facts of Life, and Who's the Boss?, and has also sung on the recordings of Peter Criss, Camper Van Beethoven, Melissa Manchester, David Pomerantz, Lynne Andersen, and others. As an instrumentalist, he‚Äôs played harmonica, B3 organ and trombone on records of top artists, including Ringo Starr, Martha Reeves, the Pointer Sisters, Randy Edelman, E.G. Daily, and Full Swing. Danny served as the musical director for the play, Working, at Santa Monica's Mayfair Theater, acting and singing in the production. He was a featured vocalist with the highly respected L.A.

New World Encyclopedia and despite consistent attempts at regulation, it continues nearly unchanged.  Ancient Near East  The Ancient Near East was home to many shrines, temples or \\"houses of heaven,\\" which were dedicated to various deities. These shrines and temples were documented by the Greek historian Herodotus in The Histories,Herodotus, The Histories 1.199, tr A.D. Godley (1920) where sacred prostitution was a common practice.See, for example, James Frazer (1922), The Golden Bough, 3e, Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus Sumerian records dating back to ca. 2400 BCE are the earliest recorded mention of prostitution as an occupation. These describe a temple-brothel operated by Sumerian priests in the city of Uruk. This kakum or temple was dedicated to the goddess Ishtar and was the home to three grades of women. The first grade of women were only permitted to perform sexual rituals in the temple, the second group had access to the grounds and catered to visitors, and the third and lowest class lived on the temple grounds. The third class was also free to find customers in the streets. In the region of Canaan, a significant portion of temple prostitutes were male. This was also widely practiced in Sardinia and in some of the Phoenician cultures, usually in honor of the goddess Ashtart. Presumably under the influence of the Phoenicians, this practice was developed in other ports of the Mediterranean Sea, such as Erice (Sicily), Locri Epizephiri, Croton, Rossano Vaglio and Sicca Veneria. Other hypotheses include Asia Minor, Lydia, Syria and the Etruscans. In later years sacred prostitution and similar classifications for females were known to have existed in Greece, Rome, India, China, and Japan. Such practices came to an end when the emperor Constantine in the 320's AD destroyed the goddess temples and replaced the religious practices with Christianity.Eusebius, Life of Constantine, 3.55 and 3.58  Biblical references  Prostitution was commonplace in ancient Israel. There are a number of references to prostitution in the Hebrew Bible. The Biblical story of Judah and Tamar () provides a depiction of prostitution being practiced in that time period. In this story the prostitute waits at the side of a highway for travelers. She covers her face in order to identify herself as a prostitute. Instead of being paid in money she asks for a kid goat. This would have been the equivalent of a high price, showing that only the wealthy owner of numerous herds could have afforded to pay for a single sexual encounter. Under this system if the traveller does not have his cattle with him he must give valuables to the woman as a deposit until a kid goat is delivered to her. The woman in the story was not a legitimate prostitute but actually was Judah's widowed daughter-in-law, who sought to trick Judah into impregnating her. However, since she succeeded in impersonating a prostitute her conduct can be assumed to accurately represent the behaviour of a prostitute in society during that time period. In a later Biblical story, found in the Book of Joshua, a prostitute in Jericho named Rahab assisted Israelite spies by providing them with information regarding the current socio-cultural and military situation. Rahab was knowledgeable in these matters because of her popularity with the high-ranking nobles. The Israelite spies, in return for this information, promised to save her and her family during the planned military invasion, only if she kept the details of her contact with them a secret. She would leave a sign on her residence that indicated to the advancing soldiers not to attack the people within. When the people of Israel conquered Canaan, she converted to Judaism and married a prominent member of the people. In the Book of Revelation, the Whore of Babylon is named \\"Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Abominations of the Earth\\". However the word \\"whore\\" could also be translated as \\"Idolatress\\". The first Babylonian prostitute was in a place called Hinchinopolises, which arose from the appraised Hinchin family. At the time Hinchinapolis was the center of attraction for all travelers who came to rest in the company of the family's women, who perfected the art of satisfaction. Some ancient scrolls could tell us that the meaning of Hinchin came from the Hebrew Hinam, meaning free, because the males of the family would offer themselves for free.œÄœåœÅŒΩŒ∑: From Greek.

Google Books Aztecs and Incas Among the Aztecs, the Cihuacalli was the name given to the controlled buildings where prostitution was permitted by political and religious authorities. Cihuacalli is a Nahuatl word which means House of Women. The Cihuacalli was a closed compound with rooms, all looking over a central patio. At the center of the patio was a statue of Tlazolteotl, the goddess of purification, steam baths, midwives, filth and a patroness of adulterers. Religious authorities believed women should work as prostitutes, if they wish, only at such premises guarded by Tlazolteotl. It was believed that Tlazolteotl had the power to incite sexual activity, while cleansing the spirit of such acts. Inca prostitutes were segregated from other people and lived under the supervision of a government agent. Antiquity=Greece= Customer and a prostitute illustrated on an ancient Greek wine cup In ancient Greece, both women and men engaged in prostitution. The Greek word for prostitute is porne (Gr: œÄœåœÅŒΩŒ∑), derived from the verb pernemi (to sell). The English word pornography, and its corollaries in other languages, are directly derivative of the Greek word pornƒì (Gr: œÄœåœÅŒΩŒ∑).List of Greek words starting with œÄŒøœÅŒΩ- (porn-), on Perseus Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women. They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek hetaera and the Japanese oiran, complex figures that are perhaps in an intermediate position between prostitution and courtisanerie. (See also the Indian tawaif.) Some prostitutes in ancient Greece, such as Lais were as famous for their company as their beauty, and some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services. Solon instituted the first of Athens' brothels (oik'iskoi) in the sixth century BC, and with the earnings of this business he built a temple dedicated to Aphrodite Pandemos, goddess of sexual pleasure. Procuring, however, was severely forbidden. In Cyprus (Paphus) and in Corinth, a type of religious prostitution was practiced where the temple counted more than a thousand prostitutes (hierodules, Gr: ŒπŒµœÅœåŒ¥ŒøœÖŒªŒµœÇ), according to Strabo. Each specialized category had its proper name, so there were the chamaitypa'i, working outdoor (lie-down), the perepatetikes who met their customers while walking (and then worked in their houses), and the gephyrides, who worked near the bridges. In the fifth century, Ateneo informs us that the price was 1 obole, a sixth of a drachma and the equivalent of an ordinary worker's day salary. The rare pictures describe that sex was performed on beds with covers and pillows, while triclinia usually didn't have these accessories. Male prostitution was also common in Greece. Adolescent boys usually practiced it, a reflection of the pederastic custom of the time. Slave boys worked the male brothels in Athens, while free boys who sold their favours risked losing their political rights as adults. =Rome= Fresco from the Pompeii brothel Prostitution in ancient Rome was legal, public and widespread. Even Roman men of the highest social status were free to engage prostitutes of either sex without incurring moral disapproval, as long as they demonstrated self-control and moderation in the frequency and enjoyment of sex. Latin literature also often refers to prostitutes. Real-world practices are documented by provisions of Roman law that regulate prostitution. Inscriptions, especially graffiti from Pompeii, uncover the practice of prostitution in Ancient Rome. Some large brothels in the fourth century, when Rome was becoming Christianized, seem to have been counted as tourist attractions and were possibly state-owned. Prostitutes played a role in several Roman religious observances, mainly in the month of April, over which the love and fertility goddess Venus presided. While prostitution was so widely accepted, prostitutes were often considered shameful. Most were slaves or former slaves, or if free by birth relegated to the infames, people lacking in social standing and deprived of the protections that most citizens under Roman law received. Prostitution thus reflects the ambivalent attitudes of Romans toward pleasure and sexuality. A registered prostitute was called a meretrix while the unregistered one fell under the broad category prostibulae. There were some similarities between the Ancient Roman and Greek system, but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign slaves, captured, purchased or raised for the purpose of prostitution. This was sometimes done by large-scale \\"prostitute farmers\\" where abandoned children were raised, and almost always raised to become prostitutes. Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a male aristocrat. Asia=India= A tawaif was a courtesan who catered to the nobility of South Asia, particularly during the era of the Mughal Empire. These courtesans would dance, sing, recite poetry and entertain their suitors at mehfils. Like the geisha tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests. While sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. The most popular or highest-class tawaifs could often pick and choose between the best of their suitors. They contributed to music, dance, theatre, film and the Urdu literary tradition. The term devadasi originally described a Hindu religious practice in which girls were married and dedicated to a deity (deva or devi). They were in charge of taking care of the temple, performing rituals they learned and practicing Bharatanatyam and other classical Indian arts traditions. This status allowed them to enjoy a high social status. The popularity of devadasis seems to have reached its pinnacle around the 10th and 11th centuries. The rise and fall in the status of devadasis can be seen to be running parallel to the rise and fall of Hindu temples. Due to the destruction of temples by Islamic invaders, the status of the temples fell very quickly in North India and slowly in South India. As the temples became poorer and lost their patron kings, and in some cases were destroyed, the devadasis were forced into a life of poverty and prostitution.Kalpana Kannabiran, \\"Judiciary, Social Reform and Debate on'Religious Prostitution'in Colonial India.\\" Economic and political weekly (1995): WS59-WS69. in JSTOR During the British East India Company's rule in India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British soldiers to engage in inter-ethnic prostitution in India, where they would frequently visit local Indian nautch dancers. As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early to mid-19th century, it became increasingly uncommon for British soldiers to visit Indian prostitutes, and miscegenation was despised altogether after the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. =Muslims= In the seventh century, the prophet Muhammad declared that prostitution is forbidden. In Islam, prostitution is considered a sin, and Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari is attributed with saying, \\"Allah's Apostle forbade taking the price of a dog, money earned by prostitution and the earnings of a soothsayer.\\" () However, sexual slavery was not considered prostitution and was very common during the Arab slave trade during the Middle Ages and early modern period. Women and girls from the Caucasus, Africa, Central Asia and Europe were captured and served as concubines in the harems of the Arab World. Ibn Battuta said several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.Insights into the concept of Slavery . San Francisco Unified School District. According to Shia Muslims, the prophet Muhammad sanctioned fixed-term marriage, called muta'a in Iraq and sigheh in Iran, which according to some Western writers, has allegedly been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden. Sunni Muslims, who make up the majority of Muslims worldwide, believe the practice of nikah mut‚Äòah was revoked and ultimately forbidden by second Sunni caliph, Umar. Shias deem all sexual relations outside of proper marriage (the only being nikah or nikah mutah) as haram. Like the Shia, Sunnis regard prostitution as sinful and forbidden. =China= Prostitution in China was due to a weak familial economy among the rural families of the country. Although China was a nation of wealth, the poverty stricken families were due to the over population of rural areas. These lives of borderline starvation drove many women out of the rural countryside to the port side cities of China. Many of the women who took part in the prostitution of China were either sold into the industry or willingly joined. Due to their lack of economic stability, parents were unable to feed all the mouths of the house and often sold their daughters into the industry. The popularity of this industry stemmed from the over population in rural villages, and an overall life of poverty for the majority of Chinese families. =Southeast Asia= In Southeast Asia, prostitution was mostly prevalent in Singapore, due to its active ports. Certain districts of Singapore were dedicated brothel districts sanctioned by the colonial governments. As colonial powers entered the Asian countries, there was an increase in number of sailors at ports. Merchant ships carried large crews of men, who lacked the company of women for days on end. As these ships docked in Asian ports, like Singapore, they were drawn to the market of prostitution. This higher demand for the company of a woman created the need for these brothel districts. =Japan= An oiran preparing herself for a client, ukiyo-e print by Suzuki Haronubu (1765) From the 15th century, Chinese, Korean and other Far Eastern visitors began frequenting brothels in Japan. This practice continued among visitors from the Western Regions, mainly European traders, beginning with the Portuguese in the 16th century who often came with their South Asian lascar crew, along with African crewmembers in some cases. In the 16th century, the local Japanese people initially assumed that the Portuguese were from Tenjiku (\\"Heavenly Abode\\"), the Japanese name for the Indian subcontinent due to its importance as the birthplace of Buddhism, and that Christianity was a new Indian faith. These mistaken assumptions were due to the Indian city of Goa being a central base for the Portuguese East India Company and also due to a significant portion of the crew on Portuguese ships being Indian Christians. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Portuguese visitors and their South Asian (and sometimes African) crew members often engaged in slavery in Japan, where they brought or captured young Japanese women and girls, who were either used as sexual slaves on their ships or taken to Macau and other Portuguese colonies in Southeast Asia, the Americas and India. For example, in Goa, a Portuguese colony in India, there was a community of Japanese slaves and traders during the late 16th and 17th centuries. Later European East India companies, including those of the Dutch and British, also engaged in prostitution in Japan. In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of Kyoto, Edo and Osaka, Japan. Oiran were courtesans in Japan during the Edo period. The oiran were considered a type of also known as a \\"woman of pleasure\\" or prostitute. Among the oiran, the tay≈´ (Â§™Â§´) was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their clients, oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and education was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded oiran was in 1761.Teruoka Yasutaka, \\"The pleasure quarters and Tokugawa culture.\\" Eighteenth Century Japan: Culture and Society (1989): 3-32. Karayuki-san, literally meaning \\"Ms. Gone Abroad\\", were Japanese women who traveled to or were trafficked to East Asia, Southeast Asia, Manchuria, Siberia and as far as San Francisco in the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century to work as prostitutes, courtesans and geisha. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a network of Japanese prostitutes being trafficked across Asia, in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Singapore and British India, in what was then known as the ‚ÄôYellow Slave Traffic‚Äô. In the early 20th century, the problem of regulating prostitution according to modern European models was widely debated in Japan.Sheldon Garon, \\"The World's Oldest Debate? Prostitution cactus and the State in Imperial Japan, 1900-1945,\\" American Historical Review 98#3 (1993), pp. 710‚Äì732 in JSTOR Middle Ages During the Middle Ages prostitution was commonly found in urban contexts. Although all forms of sexual activity outside of marriage were regarded as sinful by the Roman Catholic Church, prostitution was tolerated because it helped prevent the greater evils of rape, sodomy and masturbation. Augustine of Hippo is quoted saying, \\"if you expel prostitution from society, you will unsettle everything on account of lusts.\\" The general tolerance of prostitution was for the most part reluctant, and many people from the church urged prostitutes to reform. After the decline of organized prostitution of the Roman empire, many prostitutes were slaves. However, religious campaigns against slavery and the growing marketisation of the economy turned prostitution back into a business. By the High Middle Ages it was common to find town governments ruling that prostitutes were not to ply their trade within the town walls, but they were tolerated outside, only because these areas were beyond the jurisdiction of the authorities. In many areas of France and Germany town governments came to set aside certain streets as areas where prostitution could be tolerated. In London the brothels of Southwark were owned by the Bishop of Winchester. After this, it became common in the major towns and cities of Southern Europe to establish civic brothels. This allowed the government to outlaw any prostitution taking place outside these brothels. In much of Northern Europe a more tolerant attitude could be found towards prostitution.

An outbreak of syphilis in Naples during 1494, which later swept across Europe, may have originated from the Colombian Exchange.\\"Columbus May Have Brought Syphilis to Europe\\". LiveScience. January 15, 2008. The prevalence of other sexually transmitted diseases during the earlier 16th century may have caused this change in attitude. By the early 16th century the association between prostitutes, plague and contagion emerged, causing brothels and prostitution to be outlawed by secular authority. Furthermore, outlawing brothels and prostitution was used to \\"strengthen the criminal law\\" system of the 16th- century secular rulers. Canon law defined a prostitute as \\"a promiscuous woman, regardless of financial elements.\\" The prostitute was considered a \\"whore ‚Ä¶ who [was] available for the lust of many men,\\" and was most closely associated with promiscuity. The Church's stance on prostitution was three- fold. It included the \\"acceptance of prostitution as an inevitable social fact, condemnation of those profiting from this commerce, and encouragement for the prostitute to repent. The Church was forced to recognize its inability to remove prostitution from the worldly society, and in the 14th century \\"began to tolerate prostitution as a lesser evil.\\" However, prostitutes were excluded from the Church as long as they continued with their lifestyle. Around the 12th century, the idea of prostitute saints took hold, with Mary Magdalene being one of the most popular saints of the era. The Church used Mary Magdalene's biblical history of being a reformed harlot to encourage prostitutes to repent and mend their ways. Simultaneously, religious houses were established with the purpose of providing asylum and encouraging the reformation of prostitution. Magdalene Homes were particularly popular and peaked in the early 14th century. Over the course of the Middle Ages, popes and religious communities made various attempts to remove prostitution or reform prostitutes with varying success. With the advent of the Protestant Reformation, numbers of Southern German towns closed their brothels in an attempt to eradicate prostitution. In some periods prostitutes had to distinguish themselves from other with particular signs. They sometimes wore very short hair or no hair at all, and sometimes they wore veils in societies where other women did not wear them. Ancient codes regulated the crime of a prostitute that dissimulated her profession. 18th century Norwegian writer and painter Christian Krohg illustrating his then very controversial novel Albertine about the life of a prostitute According to Dervish Ismail Agha, in the Dell√¢kname-i Dilk√º≈ü√¢, the Ottoman archives, in the Turkish baths, the masseurs were traditionally young men who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. They also were referred to as sex workers. The Ottoman texts describe who they were, their prices, how many times they could bring their customers to orgasm and the details of their sexual practices. In the 18th century, presumably in Venice, prostitutes started using condoms made with catgut or cow bowel. 19th century In North America, prostitution was seen as a \\"necessary evil\\" that aided in marital fidelity, especially as a system that would allow men to obtain sex when their wives did not desire it. D'Emilio and Freedman document that prostitution was not a crime in the early part of the 19th century, and thus brothels (or bawdy houses) were tolerated in American cities and the laws against individual prostitutes were enforced only occasionally. In the 1830s, prostitution was becoming more visible in North-American cities, and with the professionalization of police forces, visible prostitutes such as streetwalkers risked arrest. But D'Emilio and Freedman note that raids on brothels were comparatively rare, and prostitution was tolerated in mining towns, cattle towns, and urban centers in the American east. In 1870, prostitution was legalized and regulated in the city of St. Louis Missouri. Prostitutes were licensed by public health officials, and were required to maintain weekly inspections for sexually transmitted diseases. However, due to protests and demonstrations organized by women and members of the clergy, Missouri legislators repealed the legislation allowing regulated prostitution. The Page Act of 1875 was passed by the US Congress and forbid any importation of women for the purpose of prostitution. The national move to criminalize prostitution was led by Protestant middle-class men and women who participated in the revivalism movement of the 19th century. Many of the women who posed in 19th- and early-20th-century vintage erotica were prostitutes. The most famous were the New Orleans women who posed for E. J. Bellocq. In the 19th century legalized prostitution became a public controversy as France and then the United Kingdom passed the Contagious Diseases Acts. This legislation mandated pelvic examinations for suspected prostitutes. It applied not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to their overseas colonies. Many early feminists fought to repeal these laws, either on the grounds that prostitution should be illegal and therefore not government regulated or because it forced degrading medical examinations upon women. A similar situation existed in the Russian Empire. This included prostitutes operating out of government- sanctioned brothels given yellow internal passports signifying their status and were subjected to weekly physical exams. Leo Tolstoy's novel Resurrection describes legal prostitution in 19th-century Russia. During the 19th century the British in India began to adopt the policy of social segregation, but they continued to keep their brothels full of Indian women.How carnal desire put England on top. V. N. Datta. The Sunday Tribune. September 5, 2004. In the 19th and early 20th centuries there was a network of Chinese and Japanese prostitutes being trafficked across Asia, in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Singapore and British India, in what was then known as the \\"Yellow Slave Traffic.\\" There was also a network of European prostitutes being trafficked to India, Ceylon, Singapore, China and Japan around the same time, this known as the \\"White Slave Traffic.\\" The most common destination for European prostitutes in Asia were the British colonies of India and Ceylon, where hundreds of women and girls from continental Europe and Japan serviced British soldiers. =Mining camps= The houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide were famous, especially in the 19th century when long distance imports of prostitutes became common.Julia Ann Laite, \\"Historical Perspectives on Industrial Development, Mining, and Prostitution,\\" Historical Journal, (2009) 53#3 pp. 739‚Äì761 Entrepreneurs set up shops and businesses to cater to the miners, and brothels were largely tolerated in mining towns. Prostitution in the American West was a growth industry that attracted sex workers from around the globe where they were pulled in by the money, despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige. Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes, and were often forced to send their earnings back to the family in China.Lucie Cheng Hirata, \\"Free, Indentured, Enslaved: Chinese Prostitutes in Nineteenth- Century America,\\" Signs (1979) 5f1 pp. 3‚Äì29 in JSTOR In Virginia City, Nevada, a prostitute, Julia Bulette, was one of the few who achieved \\"respectable\\" status. She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic, earning her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff. The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in 1867 and they honoured her with a lavish funeral and hanging of her assailant. Until the 1890s, madams predominately ran the businesses, after which male pimps took over. This led to a general decline in the treatment of women. It was not uncommon for brothels in Western towns to operate openly, without the stigma that was beginning to emerge in East Coast cities as a result of anti-prostitution activism. Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later, as the female population increased, reformers moved in and other civilizing influences arrived, did prostitution become less blatant and less common. After a decade or so the mining towns attracted respectable women who ran boarding houses, organized church societies, and worked as laundresses and seamstresses, all while striving for independent status. Australia mining camps had a well- developed system of prostitution. City fathers sometimes tried to confine the practice to red light districts.Elaine McKewon, \\"The historical geography of prostitution in Perth, Western Australia.\\" Australian Geographer 34.3 (2003): 297‚Äì310 . The precise role prostitution played in various camps depended on the sex ratio in specific population groups of colonial society as well as racial attitudes toward non-whites. In the early 19th century British authorities decided it was best to have lower-class white, Asian, Middle Eastern and Aboriginal women service the prisoners and thereby keep peace while maintaining strong class lines that isolated British gentlemen and ladies from the lower elements. Prostitution was so profitable that it was easy to circumvent the legal boundaries. When Australians took control by 1900 they wanted a \\"white Australia\\" and tried to exclude or expel non-white women who might become prostitutes. However, feminist activists fought against Australia's discriminatory laws that led to varying levels of rights for women, races and classes. By 1939 new attitudes toward racial harmony began to surface. These were inspired by white Australians to rethink their racist policies and adopt more liberal residency laws that did not focus on sexual or racial issues.Raelene Frances, \\"Sex Workers or Citizens? Prostitution and the Shaping of\\" Settler\\" Society in Australia.\\" International Review of Social History 44 (1999): 101‚Äì122. Latin American mining camps also had well- developed systems of prostitution.Roseann Cohen, \\"Extractive Desires: The Moral Control of Female Sexuality at Colombia's Gold Mining Frontier.\\" Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology 19.2 (2014): 260‚Äì279. In Mexico the government tried to protect and idealize middle-class women, but made little effort to protect prostitutes in the mining camps.William E.

If found infected, a woman could be sentenced to a hospital or a farm colony until cured. Beginning in the 1910s and continuing in some places into the 1950s, the American Plan operated in the United States. Women were told to report to a health officer where they were coerced to submit to an invasive examination. Immigrants, minorities and the poor were primarily targeted. In 1921, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children was signed. In this convention some nations declared reservations towards prostitution. Three prostitutes in a doorway on Rue Asselin, in Paris's red-light district, ca. 1924‚Äì25, photographed by Eug√®ne Atget The leading theorists of communism opposed prostitution. Karl Marx thought of it as \\"only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the laborer,\\" and considered its abolition to be necessary to overcome capitalism. Friedrich Engels considered even marriage a form of prostitution, and Vladimir Lenin found sex work distasteful. Communist governments often took wide-ranging steps to repress prostitution immediately after obtaining power, although the practice always persisted. In the countries that remained nominally communist after the end of the Cold War, especially China, prostitution remained illegal but was nonetheless common. In many current or former communist countries the economic depression brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union led to an increase in prostitution. During World War II, Japanese soldiers engaged in forced prostitution during their invasions across East Asia and Southeast Asia. The term \\"comfort women\\" became a euphemism for the estimated 200,000 mostly Korean and Chinese women who were forced into prostitution in Japanese military brothels during the war. Sex tourism emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and globalization. Sex tourism was typically undertaken internationally by tourists from wealthier countries. Author Nils Ringdal alleged that three out of four men between the ages of 20 and 50 who have visited Asia or Africa have paid for sex.Love for Sale: a global history of prostitution by Nils Ringdal, trans Richard Daly. By Sarah Burton. The Independent. November 2004 A new legal approach to prostitution emerged at the end of the 20th century, termed the Swedish model. This included the prohibition of buying, but not selling, of sexual services. This means that only the client commits a crime in engaging in paid sex, not the prostitute. Such laws were enacted in Sweden (1999), Norway (2009), Iceland (2009), Canada (2014), Northern Ireland (2015), France (2016), and the Republic of Ireland (2017), and are also being considered in other jurisdictions. These laws are an attempt to protect the worker and embrace the fallout of the sexual revolution, meaning sex will happen, and for it to happen safely and respectfully, there must be \\"free-form\\" regulation. 21st century In the 21st century, Afghans revived a method of prostituting young boys, which is referred to as bacha bazi. Since the break up of the Soviet Union thousands of eastern European women have become prostitutes in China, Western Europe, Israel and Turkey every year.Hornblower, Margot (24 June 2001). \\"The Skin Trade\\".

June 8, 2007 In Germany, attempts to develop a comprehensive framework for prostitution in 2017 have been met by fierce opposition from sex-workers, with less than 1% of the prostitutes submitting to their registration duty. United Kingdom The United Kingdom introduced the Sexual Offences Act of 1956 which would partly be repealed and altered by the Sexual Offences Act 2003. While this law did not criminalise the act of prostitution itself, it did prohibit such activities as running a brothel and soliciting for paid sex. Concerns were voiced over white British adolescent girls being used as prostitutes by Pakistani immigrants in the 1960s. These girls were wanted by several police departments in the early 1960s and were described as \\"good-looking and attractive, not of common appearance ... will almost certainly earn her living by prostitution and with Pakistanis.\\" United States In the United States prostitution was originally widely legal. Prostitution was made illegal in almost all states between 1910 and 1915 largely due to the influence of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which was influential in the banning of drug use and was a major force in the prohibition of alcohol. In 1917 the prostitution district Storyville in New Orleans was closed down by the Federal government over local objections. In Deadwood, South Dakota, prostitution, while technically illegal, was tolerated by local residents and officials for decades until the last madam was brought down by state and federal authorities for tax evasion in 1980. Prostitution remained legal in Alaska until 1953, and is still legal in some rural counties of Nevada, including areas outside of Las Vegas. For more, see Prostitution in Nevada. Beginning in the late 1980s many states increased the penalties for prostitution in cases where the prostitute is knowingly HIV-positive. These laws, often known as felony prostitution laws, require anyone arrested for prostitution to be tested for HIV. If the test comes back positive the suspect is informed that any future arrest for prostitution will be a felony instead of a misdemeanor. Penalties for felony prostitution vary in the states that have such laws, with maximum sentences of typically 10 to 15 years in prison. An episode of COPS which aired in the early 1990s detailed the impact of HIV/AIDS among prostitutes; this episode contributed to HIV/AIDS awareness.

Many of these positions can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive of prostitution and sex work. The Red Light district in Amsterdam Anti-prostitution feminists hold that prostitution is a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women and a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men. Pro-prostitution feminists hold that prostitution and other forms of sex work can be valid choices for women and men who choose to engage in it. In this view, prostitution must be differentiated from forced prostitution, and feminists should support sex worker activism against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system. The disagreement between these two feminist stances has proven particularly contentious, and may be comparable to the feminist sex wars (acrimonious debates on sex issues) of the late twentieth century.  Framing the debate  Newman and White in Women Power and Public Policy (2012) argue that feminist perspectives on prostitution agree on three main points: ‚ÄúFirst, they condemn the current legal policy enforcing criminal sanctions against women who offer sex in exchange for money. Second, they agree that authentic consent is the sine qua non of legitimate sex, whether in commercial or non-commercial form. Third, all feminists recognize that commercial sex workers are subject to economic coercion and are often victims of violence, and that little is done to address these problems.‚Äù They go on to identify three main feminist views on the issue of prostitution. The sex work perspective, the abolitionist perspective and the outlaw perspective. The sex work perspective maintains that prostitution is a legitimate form of work for women faced with the option of other bad jobs, therefore women ought to have the right to work in the sex trade free of prosecution or the fear of it. The sex work perspective also argues that governments should eliminate laws that criminalize voluntary prostitution. This, the sex work perspective asserts, will allow prostitution to be regulated by governments and business codes, protect sex trade workers, and improve the ability to prosecute people who hurt them. The Abolitionist perspective holds that governments should work towards the elimination of prostitution. The Outlaw Perspective views work in the sex trade as a ‚Äústepping stone to a better career or an expression of sexual freedom‚Äù. Arguments against prostitution A proportion of feminists are strongly opposed to prostitution, as they see the practice as a form of violence against women, which should not be tolerated by society. Feminists who hold such views on prostitution include Kathleen Barry, Melissa Farley,Prostitution: Factsheet on Human Rights Violations . Prostitution Research & Education. Retrieved on 2009-09-03.

Addressing Demand: Examining New Practices . Global Centurion. Retrieved on 2009-09-03. Their arguments against prostitution are explained and detailed below. Advertisements for prostitutes fill a phone booth =Coercion and poverty= These feminists argue that, in most cases, prostitution is not a conscious and calculated choice. They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced by a pimp or by human trafficking, or, when it is an independent decision, it is generally the result of extreme poverty and lack of opportunity, or of serious underlying problems, such as drug addiction, past trauma (such as child sexual abuse) and other unfortunate circumstances. These feminists point out that women from the lowest socioeconomic classes‚Äîimpoverished women, women with a low level of education, women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities‚Äîare overrepresented in prostitution all over the world; as stated by Catherine MacKinnon: \\"If prostitution is a free choice, why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it?\\". A large percentage of prostitutes polled in one study of 475 people involved in prostitution reported that they were in a difficult period of their lives and most wanted to leave the occupation.Farley, Melissa. (April/2/2000) Prostitution: Factsheet on Human Rights Violations . Prostitution Research & Education. Retrieved on 2009-09-03. Catharine MacKinnon argues that \\"In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape.\\" Some anti-prostitution scholars hold that true consent in prostitution is not possible. Barbara Sullivan says, \\"In the academic literature on prostitution there are very few authors who argue that valid consent to prostitution is possible. Most suggest that consent to prostitution is impossible or at least unlikely.\\". \\"(...) most authors suggest that consent to prostitution is deeply problematic if not impossible (...) most authors have argued that consent to prostitution is impossible. For radical feminists this is because prostitution is always a coercive sexual practice. Others simply suggest that economic coercion makes the sexual consent of sex workers highly problematic if not impossible...\\". Finally, abolitionists believe no person can be said to truly consent to their own oppression and no people should have the right to consent to the oppression of others. In the words of Kathleen Barry, consent is not a ‚Äúgood divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression. Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of ‚Äúconsent,‚Äù since even in slavery there was some consent, if consent is defined as inability to see any alternative.Barry, K \\"The Prostitution of Sexuality: The Global Exploitation of Women\\" New York: NYU Press 1995 =Long-term effects on the prostitutes= Anti-prostitution feminists argue that prostitution is a practice which leads to serious negative long-term effects for the prostitutes, such as trauma, stress, depression, anxiety, self- medication through alcohol and drug use, eating disorders and a greater risk for self-harm and suicide, as they say prostitution is an exploitative practice, which involves a woman who has sex with customers to whom she is not attracted, and which also routinely exposes the women to psychological, physical and sexual violence.Parker, Joe.

Those of us who say this are accused of being simple-minded. But prostitution is very simple. (‚Ä¶) In prostitution, no woman stays whole. It is impossible to use a human body in the way women's bodies are used in prostitution and to have a whole human being at the end of it, or in the middle of it, or close to the beginning of it. It's impossible. And no woman gets whole again later, after.‚Äù =Male dominance over women= Anti- prostitution feminists are extremely critical of sex-positive perspectives, wherein prostitution by choice is said to be part of the sexual liberation of women, that it can be empowering for women, etc. Some feminists who oppose prostitution agree that sexual liberation for women outside of prostitution is important in the fight for gender equality, but they say it is crucial that society does not replace one patriarchal view on female sexuality - e.g., that women should not have sex outside marriage/a relationship and that casual sex is shameful for a woman, etc. - with another similarly oppressive and patriarchal view - acceptance of prostitution, a sexual practice which is based on a highly patriarchal construct of sexuality: that the sexual pleasure of a woman is irrelevant, that her only role during sex is to submit to the man's sexual demands and to do what he tells her, that sex should be controlled by the man and that the woman's response and satisfaction are irrelevant. These feminists argue that sexual liberation for women cannot be achieved as long as we normalize unequal sexual practices where a man dominates a woman. Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client. These feminists believe that many clients use the services of prostitutes because they enjoy the \\"power trip\\" they derive from the act and the control they have over the woman during the sexual activity. Catharine MacKinnon argues that prostitution \\"isn't sex only, it‚Äôs you do what I say, sex.\\" Prostitution is seen by these feminists as the result of a patriarchal societal order which subordinates women to men and where the inequality between genders is present in all aspects of life. These feminists believe that prostitution is very harmful to society as it reinforces the idea that women are sex objects which exist for men's enjoyment, which can be \\"bought\\" and which can be \\"used\\" solely for men's sexual gratification. Anti-prostitution feminists argue that when a society accepts prostitution it sends the message that it is irrelevant how the woman feels during sex or what the consequences of sex will be for her, and that it is acceptable for a man to engage in sexual activity with a woman who does not enjoy it and who could be mentally and emotionally forcing herself in order to be able to cope; the normalization of such one sided sexual encounters might negatively affect the way men relate to women in general and might increase sexual violence against women. These feminists see prostitution as a form of slavery, and say that, far from decreasing rape rates, prostitution leads to a sharp increase in sexual violence against women, by sending the message that it is acceptable for a man to treat a woman as a sexual instrument over which he has total control. Melissa Farley argues that Nevada's high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution because Nevada is the only US state which allows legal brothels and is ranked 4th out of the 50 U.S. states for sexual assault crimes, saying, \\"Nevada's rape rate is higher than the U.S. average and way higher than the rape rate in California, New York and New Jersey. Why is this? Legal prostitution creates an atmosphere in this state in which women are not humans equal to them, are disrespected by men, and which then sets the stage of increased violence against women.\\" =A consequence and correlate of violence against women= Some feminists, including many who identify as supporting the abolition of prostitution, see the selling of sex as a potential after effect of violence against women. Those who support this position cite studies of violence experienced by women in prostitution prior to entering prostitution. Most (60% to 70%) were sexually abused as children 65% have been raped, most before the age of 15, and that many young women and girls enter prostitution directly from state care, at least in England, Norway, Australia and Canada. Prostitution abolitionists also object to the high rates of violence against women in the sex industry. Studies of women in prostitution show an extremely high level of violence is perpetrated against women in prostitution. Figures vary across studies. One representative study showed 82% of respondents had been physically assaulted since entering prostitution, 55% of those by clients. Additionally, 80% had been physically threatened while in prostitution, 83% of those with a weapon. 8% reported physical attacks by pimps and clients of a nature that resulted in serious injury, for example gunshot wounds and knife wounds. 68% reported having been raped since entering prostitution, 48% more than five times and 46% reporting rapes committed by clients. Finally, 49% reported pornography was made of them while they were in prostitution and 32% had been upset by an attempt to make them do what clients had seen in pornography. Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear. Many brothels have installed panic buttons because of the ongoing threat of violence indoors. Beyond the individual instances of violence or the history of violence suffered by most women in prostitution, prostitution abolitionists see prostitution itself as a form of male violence against women and children. Pdf. This understanding is the major theoretical root of calls to decriminalize prostitution(mostly women), but continue to criminalize those who prostitute them, including clients, pimps, procurers and traffickers. Prostitution abolitionists also cite similarities between prostitution and violence against women. Farley, Lynne and Cotton (2005) argue the prostitution is most like battery because it similarly involves a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour (by pimps, procurers and traffickers as well as clients) that results in the control of the women in prostitution. Research conducted by Giobbe (1993) found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence. Pdf of pages 33-58. Some prostitutes argue prostitution has similarities to rape because it is a form of sexuality that is entirely controlled by the client, as rape is a form of sexuality in which the rapist controls the interaction, disregarding the desires, physical well-being or emotional pain of the victim. = The raced and classed nature of prostitution = Prostitution abolitionists adopt an intersectional approach to understanding the power relations involved in prostitution. That is, they see prostitution as compelled by multiple forms of oppressive social power, not just sexism against women. Some analysts on human rights issues surrounding prostitution, such as Sigma Huda in her report for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, also adopt this approach: :‚ÄúThe act of prostitution by definition joins together two forms of social power (sex and money) in one interaction. In both realms (sexuality and economics) men hold substantial and systematic power over women. In prostitution, these power disparities merge in an act which both assigns and reaffirms the dominant social status of men over the subordinated social status of women.‚ÄùHuda, S \\"Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights aspects of the victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, Sigma Huda\\" for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, February 2006 :‚ÄúThe demand for commercial sex is often further grounded in social power disparities of race, nationality, caste and colour.‚Äù Abolitionists attribute prostitution to women's comparative lack of economic resources. Globalisation and neoliberalism have exacerbated already unequal economic relations, including by cutting back social spending in Northern and formerly socialist countries, and increasing the demand for cheap labour, including in prostitution, in both Southern and Northern countries. Combined with sex discrimination in wages and job type, sexual harassment in the workplace, and an undue burden of caring for children, the elderly and the ill, women are at a significant economic disadvantage in the current economic structure. Poverty is the single greatest ‚Äúpush‚Äù factor making women vulnerable to accepting prostitution as a means of subsistence.O'Connor, M and Healy, G \\"The Links Between Prostitution and Sex Trafficking: A Briefing Handbook\\" Prepared for the Joint Project Coordinated by the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW) and the European Women‚Äôs Lobby (EWL) on Promoting Preventative Measures to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings for Sexual Exploitation: A Swedish and United States Governmental and Non-Governmental Organisation Partnership 2006 In addition, racism shapes women's entry into prostitution, both because it makes women more vulnerable to prostitution and because clients demand racialized women in prostitution. Racism in education, economic and political systems affect the choices of women of colour. Additionally, racist sexualisation, through pornography in particular, of Black and Asian women as over-sexed and submissive or otherwise available for prostitution contributes to the demand for specifically racialized women. Massage parlours, strip clubs and other prostitution businesses are often located in poor and racialized neighbourhoods, encouraging clients to troll those neighbourhoods for women, making all women in those neighbourhoods vulnerable to prostitution-related harassment and women in those neighbourhoods more likely to accept their use in prostitution as normal. Indigenous women around the world are particularly targeted for prostitution. In Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, and Taiwan, studies have shown that indigenous women are at the bottom of the race and class hierarchy of prostitution, often subjected to the worst conditions, most violent demands and sold at the lowest price. It is common for indigenous women to be over- represented in prostitution when compared with their total population. This is as a result of the combined forces of colonialism, physical displacement from ancestral lands, destruction of indigenous social and cultural order, misogyny, globalization/neoliberalism, race discrimination and extremely high levels of violence perpetrated against them. The Aboriginal Women's Action Network, an abolitionist organization in Canada, has specifically noted that because the prostitution of Aboriginal women results from and reinforces such extreme hatred of Aboriginal women, no regime of legalisation (which will expand the industry and entrap more women) can be safer for Aboriginal women. Prostitution can only further harm Aboriginal women. =Outlawing of buying sexual services= In 1999, Sweden became the first country to make it illegal to pay for sex, but not to be a prostitute (the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute). Similar laws were passed in Norway (in 2009)New Norway law bans buying of sex. BBC News (2009-01-01). Retrieved on 2009-09-03. and in Iceland (in 2009).Fr√©ttir / A new law makes purchase of sex illegal in Iceland 21.4.2009 Jafnr√©ttisstofa In February 2014, the members of the European Parliament voted in a non-binding resolution, (adopted by 343 votes to 139; with 105 abstentions), in favor of the 'Swedish Model' of criminalizing the buying, but not the selling of sex. In 2014, the Council of Europe has made a similar recommendation, stating that \\"While each system presents advantages and disadvantages, policies prohibiting the purchase of sexual services are those that are more likely to have a positive impact on reducing trafficking in human beings\\". During 2011, the newly elected government of Denmark began discussing the possibility of banning the buying of sexual services.The Danish election: a new government ‚Äì and towards a new prostitution regime? . Nordic Prostitution Policy Reform (2011-09-21). Retrieved on 2012-06-25. while during 2009, there is lobbying taking place for such a law in Hungary.Hungary: Turning Clients Into Criminals . Carnal San Francisco. Retrieved on 2009-09-03. These laws are a natural extension of the views of the feminists who oppose prostitution. These feminists reject the idea that prostitution can be reformed, and oppose any harm reduction approach. Trisha Baptie, a Canadian former prostitute, who now opposes the industry, and lobbies for the outlawing of buying sexual services, wrote: \\"Harm reduction ? You can‚Äôt make prostitution \\"safer\\"; prostitution is violence in itself. It is rape, the money only appeases men's guilt, \\" \\"One of the most ‚Äúsex-positive‚Äù things you can do is make sure men cannot buy sex, because the buying of sex is violence against women and is a direct deterrent to women‚Äôs equality. \\" These feminists see prostitution as a form of violence against women and vehemently condemn the common pro-legalization argument that \\"prostitution has always existed and will never go away\\", arguing that other violent acts such as murder, rape and child sexual abuse have also always existed and will never be eradicated either, and that is not a reason to legalize them. These feminists argue that the idea of legalizing prostitution in order to control it and \\"make it a little better\\" and reduce harm is no different from the idea of legalizing domestic violence in order to control it and \\"make it a little better\\" and reduce harm. Pro-sex worker perspectives To directly counteract the view of prostitution as the oppression of women, some scholars and feminists have voiced their opinion in support of prostitution and other forms of sex-work. Support is based on ideas of economic empowerment, independence and autonomy of choice, comparisons to sexual role in marriage, and challenging outdated societal notions of the proper expression of women's sexuality. = Proponents and support groups = Activists and scholars who are proponents of the pro- sex work position include: Margo St. James, Norma Jean Almodovar,Norma Jean Almodovar, 2002, \\"For Their Own Good: The Results of the Prostitution Laws as Enforced by Cops, Politicians, and Judges\\", in Liberty for Women, W. McElroy (ed.), Chicago: Ivan R. Dee. Kamala Kempadoo,Kamala Kempadoo, and Doezema, J., (eds.), 1998, Global Sex Workers: Rights, Resistance, and Redefinition, New York: Routledge. Laura Mar√≠a Agust√≠n, Annie Sprinkle, Carol Leigh (also known as Scarlot Harlot), Carol Queen and Audacia Ray. To assist women not involved in traditional ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs work,‚Äù pro-sex work formed to create a helpful environment for sex workers. Social activist groups like The Red Thread, founded in 1985, seek to educate the public, provide legal and medical assistance to sex workers, and help organize sex workers into groups in order to better protect themselves and to become advocates.Holly B. Fechner, Three Stories of Prostitution in the West: Prostitutes' Groups, Law and Feminist \\"Truth\\", 4 Colum. J. Gender & L. 26, 33 (1994). Liberal feminists and groups such as The Red Thread, The International Committee for Prostitutes (ICPR) and COYOTE seek to ensure that sex work is seen as a valid choice that women may make without overtly oppressive forces. = Economic empowerment = One view is that sex work not only empowers women, but it provides women with greater opportunities for financial advancement.Lars O. Ericson, Charges against Prostitution: An Attempt at a Philosophical Assessment, 90 Ethics 335, 354 (1980). There are liberal and radical feminist proponents of female empowerment through sex work.Katie Beran, Revisiting the Prostitution Debate: Uniting Liberal and Radical Feminism in Pursuit of Policy Reform, 30 Law & Ineq. 19, 31 (2012) Liberal feminists view prostitution as the sale of sex solely for economic gain, and thus it cannot be differentiated from any other sale of goods. The selling of sex ultimately consists of a buyer and a seller trying to negotiate for the best deal.Id. Interfering in this sale of goods could not only be interfering with the rights of the buyer, but also of the seller. Women who have chosen to enter the field should not be looked down upon and should not have their choice considered to be lesser than another type of socially accepted employment. Liberal feminists argue that while prostitution and sex work may not be the ideal job for many women, it can provide a way of life and prosperity that would be otherwise unattainable. Sex work can be seen as a better alternative to working for minimum wage or working in a field that that society decided is ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs work.‚Äù = Self empowerment = To conclude that all sex workers partake in the industry because of oppression, past sexual abuse, and lack of opportunity, creates a critical division in feminism and equality. Assuming that all women who chose to partake in sex work are victims of oppression violates their ability to make an autonomous choice. The autonomy theory of feminism seeks to instill in women the right to ‚Äústand on their own, make their own decisions, and pursue their own notion of a life lived well.‚ÄùKatherine T. Bartlett, Deborah Rhode, & Joanna L. Grossman, Gender and Law, 599 (6th ed. 2013). It cannot be ignored that some women freely chose to become sex workers not because of oppression, but because of their love for sex and desire for power. Sex work can also create a sense of independence for women. Rather than relying on a husband or a partner, sex work allows women to make choices completely free from pressure or influence. While women are socialized to hide their sexuality, sex workers are free to explore their sexuality and to openly choose their sexual partners. Sex workers, whether they work on the streets or in hotels, have the freedom to accept or to reject clients. They are free to accept or to decline any sexual advance. This stands in direct opposition to the married housewife who does not have the sexual autonomy of the sex worker.Lars Ericson, Charges against Prostitution, 90 Ethics 335, 354 (1980). Whereas radical feminists consider sex workers to be victims of circumstances and false consciousness,Katherine T. Bartlett ET AL., Gender and Law, at 657. the liberal feminists and women who chose to participate in sex work do not consider themselves to be victims of any sort. Instead, they consider their actions to be liberating and providing them with a sense of control.Ronald Weitzer, Legalizing Prostitution: From Illicit Vice to Lawful Business, 7 (2012). = Marriage analogy = Sex work and prostitution have often been compared to a marriage in which the man is the breadwinner, while the woman stays at home and cares for the family. There does not appear to be a distinction between the woman who has devoted her body to her husband in exchange for his promise to take care of her, and the sex worker who has chosen to sell sexual acts in exchange for payment. Those who are opposed to prostitution will state that marriage and monogamy cannot be compared to prostitution because a marriage is beyond a contract, and a marriage does not advocate for the dominance of the man over the woman.Carole Pateman, Prostitution: Charges Against Ericson, 93 Ethics 561, 562-63 (1983). However, the difference goes beyond dominance but to choice. The true difference between the dependent spouse and the sex worker is that the independent sex worker does not belong to one man; in fact, she does not belong to anyone but herself. = Acceptance of women's sexuality = Liberal feminists argue that the patriarchal and moralistic view of sex as the ultimate expression of a woman's love must be changed in order for society to truly understand the sexual nature of women.Katherine T. Bartlett ET AL., Gender and Law, at 658. A pro sex worker stance is inextricably linked to the idea of women finally not being forced to view romantic sex as the only type of sex. Notions of ‚Äúproper womanhood and conventional sexuality‚ÄùRonald Weitzer, Legalizing Prostitution, at 7. cannot be linked to a woman's choice in one sexual partner or multiple, or a woman's choice to engage in sexual intercourse in exchange for love or for money. Proper woman is a term that has its definition rooted in socialization and not fact. Prostitution and sex work are about more than the female sexual experience. Sex work can provide female empowerment and instill ‚Äúa sense of self worth, self-confidence, and self esteem.‚Äù Id. at 9. =Legalization or decriminalization= Feminists who support the legalization or decriminalization of prostitution argue that one of the significant flaws with the radical anti-prostitution feminist view is that a majority of its arguments are premised on the assumption that prostitution itself is inherently laced with sexism, classism and other unbalanced power relations. The institution of prostitution itself is seen by abolitionists as resting on these conditions and therefore they believe legalization or decriminalization will only lead to the reinforcement of these conditions. Pro-sex-work feminists argue that this assumption is flawed, and that while prostitution, as it currently exists in our society, can be misogynist or degrading in some manifestations, there is a grave danger in attributing these conditions to prostitution itself. They argue that targeting prostitution as a whole unduly focuses attention on this single institution in our society, rather than looking at society at large and the social institutions, laws and practices that lead to the subordination and oppression of women. There has been much debate over the last few decades amongst feminists about how laws relating to prostitution should be reformed. Most liberal feminists who look at prostitution from a capitalist perspective support some form of either decriminalization or legalization. Decriminalization is the removal of all penalties for prostitution itself and for all the activities necessary for prostitutes to do their work, such as advertising, communicating with clients, etc. It does not mean the reversal of all laws relating to prostitution, for example laws that exist against forcing someone into prostitution. For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word ‚Äúprostitution‚Äù to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term \\"criminal sexual acts\\". The term 'legalization', on the other hand, is usually used in the context of prostitution to refer to the use of criminal laws to regulate prostitution by determining the legal conditions under which prostitutes can operate. Legalization can mean anything from rigid controls under a state-controlled system to merely defining the operation of a privatized sex industry. Legalization is often accompanied by strict criminal penalties for anyone who operates outside the legally defined framework. With legalization there may be rules about where prostitution can take place (for example only in state licensed brothels), what prostitutes can do, mandatory registry/licensing and frequent mandatory health exams. Some pro-sex-worker feminists support decriminalization and some support legalization, for different reasons. Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers. They argue that decriminalization is better for the workers than legalization and that both criminalization and heavily regulated legalization infringe on the workers' safety and human rights. Many feminists who support sex workers favor decriminalization because it allows prostitutes to go into business for themselves and self-determination is a tenet of feminist politics. They believe decriminalization fosters responsibility, empowerment, self-esteem and self-care, all important feminist values. The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person. Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry. = Men and non-binary sex workers = Pro- sex work advocates also point out that many men and non-binary individuals also willingly engage in sex work for a variety of reasons. Gay and bisexual men, for example, often view sex work as a profitable extension of their normal sex lives, sometimes using sex work to supplement their regular incomes. These sex workers argue that anti-sex work advocates harm them by passing anti-sex work laws and reducing state-run social services. Other perspectives There are many feminists whose views on prostitution do not fit in either the anti-prostitution feminist or the sex-positive feminist viewpoints, and in some cases are critical of both. These feminist authors have criticized what they see as the unproductive and often bitter debate that characterizes the two-position analysis of prostitution. Such authors highlight that in allowing arguments about prostitution to be reduced to a stale analysis and theoretical debate, feminists are themselves contributing to the marginalization of prostitutes, simplifying the nature of the work they carry out and the personal circumstances that involve each individual.O‚ÄôNeill, Maggie (2001) Prostitution and Feminism. Polity Press: Cambridge pg 23 Feminist scholar Laurie Shrage has also criticized the haphazard nature of feminist views on prostitution. Shrage claims that in a determination to undermine patriarchy, pro-sex feminists have advocated a reckless and \\"Milton Friedman style\\" deregulation of laws surrounding prostitution, without considering the implications that this may have upon women involved in sex work, particularly given the nature of the sex trade, which is more likely to be plagued by exploitation and poor working conditions, concerns that must be of importance to any feminist. p 83. = Views of Prostitution in Developing Regions =Asia=Thailand= In 1997, Thailand had an estimated two hundred thousand women and children that were involved in prostitution.Lenore. Prostitution Policy: Revolutionizing Practice Through a Gendered Perspective. New York: New York University Press, 2002. Print. An estimated 11 percent of the country's gross domestic income is from prostitution. This means that prostitution has become a necessary source of revenue. This contradiction in the country arises because they are stuck in between traditional and modern views because the amount of gross national income prostitution brings into the country. MacDonald, Gayle. ‚ÄúLoose Women and Lecherous Men: A Feminist Philosophy of Sex/Sex and Borders: Gender, National Identity, and Prostitution Policy in Thailand/Prostitution Policy: Revolutionizing Practice through a Gendered Perspective.‚Äù Canadian Journal of Women & the Law, vol. 15, no. 2, Dec. 2003, pp. 371‚Äì377. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=lgh&AN;=15398883&site;=ehost- live&scope;=site.<  Africa  A large number of women and children are trafficked from Africa to other parts of the world. Many of the women are trafficked to work as prostitutes. It has been suggested that the scale of the trafficking may be in part due to many Africans having no birth registration and hence no official nationality, making them easier to transport across borders. It is also argued that the significant negative economic impact on Africa resulting from this trafficking combines with the continent's existing high levels of poverty and low educational attainment to further expand the supply for human traffickers.

Originally based in Melbourne, the Adelaide office, which operates today, was set up in 1982. A full-time Australian editor was appointed between 1979 and 1982 and again between 1997 and 2002. Between 1982 and 1997 and since 2002, editorial duties in Australasia have been carried out on an ad hoc basis as required by the New Internationalist team in the UK. The UK New Internationalist was launched in Britain as a monthly magazine in 1973. Its forerunner was The Internationalist sent termly to members of the student development organization Third World First. New Internationalist Australia is run by New Internationalist Publications, a co-operative-run publisher based in Oxford, England. The magazine also has offices in Adelaide, Australia, Christchurch, New Zealand (Aoteoroa) and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Editorial duties are primarily carried out by the New Internationalist team based in the UK. The other offices focus primarily on marketing, sales and securing subscriptions. In May 2009, the New Internationalist had 60,000 subscribers worldwide. The number of subscribers in Australia was 11,000.Figures from New Internationalist Australia, June 2009 Late 2014 saw a move of the Adelaide office from 28 Austin Street to 15 Austin Street.  Early History 1979-86  New Internationalist Australia ‚Äì named New Internationalist Publications Pty Ltd (NIPPL) ‚Äì was incorporated on 15 March 1979, holding its inaugural meeting the day after. It was funded by four agencies which became its shareholders: Australian Catholic Relief (ACR ‚Äì now known as Caritas (charity) Australia), Asia Partnership for Human Development (APHD), Australian Council of Churches (ACC) and Community Aid Abroad (CAA ‚Äì now known as Oxfam Australia). On formation, a full-time editor was appointed, based in Melbourne. The first editor resigned after just five months. The second, Bob Hawkins, was recruited by the Australian board at the end of 1979 and edited three issues of the magazine ‚Äì Elites (November 1980), Pacific Islands (produced in Papua New Guinea, July 1981) and Indonesia (October 1982). In the period 1979‚Äì1982, there was significant tension between the New Internationalist team in the UK and the Australian Board. The tension arose because, on the one hand, the Australian Board felt that there was insufficient Australasian content in the magazine during this period whilst, on the other hand, the New Internationalist team in the UK felt that the magazine had to focus on subjects drawing on examples from all around the world rather than concentrating on particular regions. The New Internationalist team in the UK also felt that the quality of the editorial material submitted from Australia was not high enough. This tension was evident as early as 1980 when the New Internationalist team in the UK appointed Bob Hawkins as editor of the issue on Elites when he and the Australian board wanted the issue to focus on Pacific resources or Maoris.Internal office operations manual written by the NI Oxford team The period of tension ended with the resignation of Bob Hawkins in 1982 and a restructuring of New Internationalist Australia carried out when Chris Sheppard from the New Internationalist team in the UK travelled to Melbourne in September of the same year. The result was that Brian Loffler of CAA Data Aid in Adelaide was appointed to the board as Joint Company Secretary and given the task of setting up the Adelaide office. At the same time, it was decided that Cameron Forbes of the Melbourne Age should be paid a retainer to undertake any editorial duties that the New Internationalist team in the UK required. This ensured that significant financial savings were made since, not only did the board not have to pay a full-time editor‚Äôs salary, but also costly airfares to the UK were reduced significantly (Bob Hawkins had frequently flown over to the UK to participate in editorial meetings with the UK team). The restructuring of New Internationalist Australia was a success, with subscriptions to the magazine in Australia more than doubling between December 1981 (2,409) and May 1986 (5,412). In addition, from July 1983, the magazine began to be sold on news-stands. As a result of improving sales, New Internationalist Australia became financially self-sufficient in March 1984 and has remained so ever since.  Key developments 1986‚Äì2000  In 1986, Australian Catholic Relief (ACR) and the Asia Partnership for Human Development (APHD) withdrew from the board, following an issue of the magazine which focused on Sex (April 1986). These Catholic aid agencies had long had reservations about the magazine‚Äôs treatment of subjects such as family planning and homosexuality, their reservations sparked particularly by issues of the magazine on The Family (December 1982) and Feminism (August 1985). In 1987, the non-executive directors of the company (who had held their director positions as representatives of the various founding organisations) resigned to allow the company to become a worker-run company. In 1996, a flat salary structure was adopted. Since then, all permanent members of staff have received the same base salary, independent of the type of work being undertaken. In 1997, Anouk Ride was appointed Australasian Editor of the New Internationalist magazine, working part-time from the Adelaide, Australia office and part-time from the Oxford, UK office. This was a significant appointment as it was the first time a full-time Australasian editor had been in place since 1982. She held the position until her resignation in December 2000. In 1998, New Internationalist Australia was contracted by the Oxford- based New Internationalist company (NIPL) to maintain and develop the fledgling website for the international group, with a particular focus on creating an on-line archive of back issues of the magazine. In the years which followed, New Internationalist Australia was also contracted to manage the design and production of a range of CD-ROMs on themes of global issues, international relations and international development. For example, New Internationalist Australia was contracted to produce the annual New Internationalist Archive CD-ROM, an electronic record of more than 20 years of the New Internationalist magazine.  Key developments from 2000  Since its formation, New Internationalist Australia had always been run as a not-for- profit company. In 2001, this was fully formalized through recognition by the Australian Taxation Office that New Internationalist Publications Pty Ltd (NIPPL) is a not-for-profit community service organization. From mid-2001 until mid-2002, Chris Richards held the position of Australasian Editor. Then, from 2002 to mid-2009, Chris was retained by the Oxford-based New Internationalist company (NIPL) as an editorial consultant. She resigned in May 2009. As part of a long-term commitment to the notion that visual representations of the globe can greatly influence perceptions, New Internationalist Australia negotiated a partnership with ODT Maps in the US in 2004. New Internationalist Australia‚Äôs role was to design and produce the DVD Many Ways to See the World that had been commissioned and written by ODT Maps.  Digital magazine subscriptions  In 2013 New Internationalist Australia built its first digital magazine subscription system in Ruby on Rails. The open source project resides on GitHub.

It opened in 1861 as a replacement for the University's old observatory at Rundet√•rn. History √òstervold Observatory The first astronomical observatory operated by the University of Copenhagen was Rundet√•rn. It had been inaugurated in 1642 as a replacement for Tycho Brahe's Stjerneborg, but during the early 19th century had become outdated as astronomical instruments grew bigger and bigger while the tower could not be expanded. In the same time, light pollution from the surrounding city as well as vibrations caused by the still increasing traffic in the streets below had made the observations inaccurate. The dome of the observatory In 1861 the observatory was moved to √òstervold, where a new observatory was constructed on the old bastioned fortifications of the city, which had become outdated and were being disabandonned. The well-known Russian-German astronomer, Heinrich Louis d'Arrest, who had been appointed professor in astronomy at the university in 1857, was chosen to plan the new observatory. He used the observatory for his study of nebulas, in 1867 publishing an astronomical catalogue of 1,942 nebulas with 4,900 positions. He also did significant work in spectroscopy, and discovered, for the first time, the differences in the evolutionary state and spatial distribution of stars. While d'Arrest used the main telescope, observer H. C. F. C. Schjellerup used the Meridian circle for creating one of the most comprehensive astronomical catalogues of the time of stars of the 8th-9th magnitude: 10,000 positions on 259 observation nights. The next director of the √òstervold Observatory was Thorvald N. Thiele, a skilful mathematician who developed a new method of determining the orbit of Binary stars. He founded the tradition for numerical computational mathematics, which has lasted up to modern times. In 1907, Elis Str√∂mgren was appointed professor and director of the observatory, and under his direction the computational work continued. The dome of the observatory seen from Rosenborg Castle Gardens During World War I, the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, founded by Astronomische Gesellschaft in 1882, was moved from Kiel, Germany, to the √òstervold Observatory. It remained located in Copenhagen until 1965, when it was moved to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, United States. In 1940 Ellis Str√∂mgren was succeeded by his son Bengt Str√∂mgren, who made the pioneering discovery that hydrogen is the most abundant element in the stellar interior. He was also the first to make the correct interpretation of the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram (the relation between the total energy output from a star and its surface temperature was independently found by the Danish chemist and astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung and the American astronomer Henry Norris Russell). Around 1950, he developed the UVBY√ü photoelectric system, which is still in use today. In the 1950s, the √òstervold Observatory was replaced by the Brorfelde Observatory located near the town of Holb√¶k, which was provided with a very fine meridian circle and a Schmidt telescope with a camera that used photographic film. It houses a 300 double reflector with a focal depth of 4.9m. Building √òstervold ObservatoryWium The √òstervold Observatory is a south-facing, three- winged building, designed by Christian Hansen. The central wing is topped by a dome. containing the main instrument. The side wings contained residences for the director, the observer as well as assistants. To secure the best possible foundation of the instruments, the foundation of the building rests on the original, true ground surface, penetrating the entire depth of the ramparts on which the building stands. This took 1/3 of the bricks used for the entire complex. =Instruments= The original main instrument of the observatory, housed in the dome, was a 280 mm refractor with a focal distance of 4.9 m. In 1895, this telescope was replaced by a 360 mm refractor with a focal length of 4.9 m and a 200 mm photographic lens with a focal length of 4.8 m. The purchase of the double refractor enabled the observatory to participate in photographic observations without having to give up visual observations. This double refractor is still found in the dome of the √òstervold Observatory, while the 1861 refractor is displayed at the Steno Museum in √Örhus. c Directors 1862-1875: Heinrich Louis d'Arrest 1875-1907: Thorvald N.

Qatar's financial status witnessed significant improvements during his reign as a result of the enrichment and discovery of several new oil fields. Qatar also gained its independence as a sovereign state in September 1971 under his rule. He was deposed in February 1972 by his cousin, Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani. Biography=Early life and deposition= Sheikh Ahmad was born in Doha, the capital city and state of Qatar, in 1922 as the 2nd son of Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani, along with his 12 siblings, to be exact, he had 9 brothers and 3 sisters, although some sources prove that he had 10 brothers instead of 9. He took the throne on 24 October 1960 after his father, Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani, abdicated in his favor. Sheikh Ahmad then assumed throne and became the emir through the final years of dependency, overseeing the nation's independence from Great Britain in 1971. Sheikh Ahmad attended numerous royal coronations, including the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey in 1953. On the same day his reign began, his cousin Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani was appointed as the heir apparent and deputy ruler. On 22 February 1972 Sheikh Khalifa deposed him. During the incident, Sheikh Ahmad was in Iran on a hunting trip. After his deposition, Sheikh Ahmad lived in exile in Dubai with his wife, the daughter of the late Ruler of Dubai and children, in that emirate. =Reign=1963 Arab Nationalism movements In April 1963, a nationalist labor group known as the National Unity Front was formed in response to a relative of Sheikh Ahmad opening fire on a nationalist demonstration and killing a protester. The demonstration had been organized by North Yemeni migrant workers who supported their government's union with the United Arab Republic. The group's formation was precipitated by public dissent with the ruling family's extravagant lifestyles and Sheikh Ahmed's long absences abroad since he ascended to the throne in 1960. Co-founded by a wealthy businessman and a tribal leader, the group soon gained popularity among Arab nationalists, individuals sympathetic to the Ba'ath Party and Qatari laborers. They staged a mini-uprising in the central Doha market that year in response to the shooting where they presented their demands to the government. Some of these demands would have curtailed Sheikh Ahmad's power. The government rejected all these demands, and amid a tense atmosphere, many of the National Unity Front members were arrested and detained without trial. However, Sheikh Ahmad did institute some reforms, such as the provision of land and loans to poor farmers. =Achievements=Economic achievements Sheikh Ahmad's rule witnessed the growing economic activities in the country as the result of the discovery of a large number of oil fields in Qatar. At that time, and in January 1964, full-scale production commenced in the Idd al-Shargi field, the first seabed field in the world to be operated entirely as an offshore facility. Moreover, in 1963, the larger field at Maydan Mahzam was discovered and in 1965 an oil terminal was set up on the Island of Halul. Exploration of the Bul Hannien field started in 1965 and production commenced in 1977. With the growth of oil economy, Qatar moved rapidly towards the introduction of modern administrative system. Sheikh Ahmad established the Ministry of Finance in November 1960 and Sheikh Khalifa, the Heir Apparent and Deputy Ruler at that time, was appointed as the first Minister of Finance. After that, Sheikh Ahmed established The Department of General Financial and Administration in order to handle all governmental affairs of a financial and administrative nature. Then, in 1967, the Department of Civil Service was also set up. Independence of Qatar Gradually the administration of Qatar began to take final shape and the country moved for independence. Following the British Labour Government's announcement in January 1968, for withdrawal from the east of Suez terminating the treaties of protection with the Gulf rulers and their failure to form a confederation of the nine gulf states, Qatar moved forward for forming a Cabinet. On 2 April 1970, the Provisional Constitution for Qatar was promulgated and the first Council of Ministers of the country was formed on 28 May 1970. The independence of Qatar as a sovereign state terminating the Anglo-Qatari Treaty of 1916 was declared on 3 September 1971. =Marriage and children= Sheikh Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani had married three times. One of his spouses was the daughter of Shaikh Rashid bin Said Al Maktum, then Ruler of Dubai. He had nine children, seven sons and two daughters. *Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Ahmad Al Thani *Sheikh Nasser bin Ahmad Al Thani *Sheikh Hamad bin Ahmad Al Thani *Sheikh Saud bin Ahmad Al Thani *Sheikha Hessa bint Ahmed Al Thani *Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmad Al Thani *Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad Al Thani *Sheikha Muneera bint Ahmed Al Thani *Sheikh Mansour bin Ahmad Al Thani =Death= Though some reconciliation was achieved with his cousin Sheikh Ahmad elected to remain in exile and died in London while getting treated for cancer on 25 November 1977 and his body was flown back to Qatar and received by the ruling family and he received a formal funeral which was attended by the Emir and ruling family and buried in Al Rayyan cemetery and a three-day mourning period was announced.

The standard Irish Gaelic form of these names is Amhlaoibh (pronounced \\"ow-liv\\", and \\"owl-lee\\"); which can be Anglicised as Auliffe and Humphrey. The Old Irish personal name Amla√≠b is a Gaelicised form of the Old Norse √ìl√°fr, and is recorded in the Annals of Ulster as being introduced into Ulster by \\"Amla√≠b, son of the king of Lochlann\\" In the 9th century, √ìl√°fr may have been pronounced more like the Old Norse √Åleifr. A Classical Gaelic form of this Old Irish name is Amhla√≠bh. The older Irish Gaelic names Amalgaid and Amhalghaidh (pronounced \\"owl-ghee\\"), were borne by an early king of Munster, and an early king of Connacht.

It was founded in 1994 and in 2008 it enrolled roughly 280 students at the primary and middle-school levels (up from roughly 200 in 2002). History The origins of the school go back to May 1994; a South Korean ethnographer doing research on the indigenous peoples of Siberia had been in discussions with the government of the Sakha Republic to set up a Korean-language school, and began to look for teachers in South Korea. Gang Deok-su, a professor of Russian at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies and head of the Sakha-Korea Friendship association, agreed to assist. The Yakutsk Korean Association, founded in 1989, had previously set up Sunday schools for the teaching of the Korean language, but due to the increasing demand for specialists of the language, powerful supporters threw their weight behind the move to set up a full-time school, including president of the Sakha Republic Mikhail Nikolayev. Then-head of the Yakutsk Department of Education Evgeniya Mikhailova provided early local leadership for the project; the Sakha Republic government has continued to provide financial support to the school as part of its wider plan to improve foreign-language education in the republic. Other early local supporters of the school included head of the Institute for Advanced Education Studies–ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –ø–æ–≤—ã—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫–≤–∞–ª–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è Olga Chorosova and chairwoman of the Yakutsk Korean Association Vera Shamayeva. In 2006, the school established a branch in Aldansky Ulus. Roughly 250 students have graduated from the school since its founding. Its fifteenth anniversary, in December 2009, was celebrated in a ceremony attended by Mikhailova (who by then had risen to the position of vice-president of the Sakha Republic), minister of internal affairs Georgy Nikonov, and the South Korean consul- general of Irkutsk, Choi Seok-in. Staff Evgeniy Cherepanov Jeka was promoted from vice-principal to principal in 2002, when her predecessor Gennady Kim decided to take another job. The school has a teaching staff of 25 full-time teachers and 5 part-time teachers. Their staff includes four South Korean teachers. Programme Among other subjects, the school offers Korean as a second language, taught by the native Korean teachers; teaching begins in the 5th grade, with three contact hours per week. It is one of two schools in Yakutsk which offers Korean to young students, the other being School #16. The teachers experience some culture shock at the different style of education, including the relative lack of age-based hierarchy at the school. The school also introduces other aspects of Korean culture to students, such as taekwondo, Korean music and Korean cuisine. Japanese and Chinese languages are also taught. Each summer, the school sends about 10 to 20 of its students to Seoul, South Korea, on study-abroad and homestay programmes. Graduates have gone on to work in a variety of Korean-related fields including translation and as language instructors at Yakutsk State University; others have earned places at South Korean universities for further studies.

It is one of the world's largest private financiers of the microfinance sector. The idea for Oikocredit came from a 1968 meeting of the World Council of Churches. Following this, Oikocredit was established in 1975 in the Netherlands. As a co-operative, Oikocredit finances and invests in fair trade organisations, co- operatives, microfinance institutions, and small to medium-sized enterprises in many developing countries, with the aim of effecting positive social change. In 2016 Oikocredit had offices in 31 countries. In turn, Oikocredit‚Äôs 800+ partners provide entrepreneurs, small businesses, agricultural co- operatives, and other productive enterprises with the long-term capital and other support they need to build their businesses, support their families, sustain their communities, and help protect the planet. On 25 March 2010, Oikocredit announced that it had reached ‚Ç¨ 1 billion in cumulative committed loans and investments since the organisation began its operations. In 2009, a year when financial institutions encountered difficult market conditions, Oikocredit achieved record high inflows: Oikocredit's capital inflow reached ‚Ç¨ 62.9 million and its total assets grew by 13% to ‚Ç¨ 537 million at the year end.Press Release on ‚Ç¨ 1 billion cumulative investments with social impact Oikocredit‚Äôs financial resources primarily derive from investments (¬£150 minimum, no maximum) contributed by 54,000 individuals, institutions and faith-based organisations worldwide.

As of 2014, Oikocredit channeled ‚Ç¨40.3m (¬£31.7m) of its investment capital into 85 fair trade partner organisations, many in coffee and cocoa enterprises in Latin America and Africa.

On 23 June 1959 he was appointed as Ambassador of the Soviet Union to Australia, and presented his Letters of Credence to Governor-General of Australia William Slim on 10 August 1959. While Kurdyukov was ambassador to Australia, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS) exploited an opportunity to target Soviet intelligence in a \\"sting operation\\".Richard C. S. Trahair & Robert L. Miller, Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations; New York, Enigma Books; p282. During September 1960, Kay Marshall, an Englishwoman working as a civil servant in New Zealand, had reported approaches from Soviet agents. At the request of NZSIS, Marshall allowed Soviet agents to believe that she would cooperate, and moved in December 1960 to Australia, where she liaised with ASIO. For two years, Marshall's Soviet controller, Ivan Skripov (First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Canberra) assigned her small tasks, in order to gauge her suitability as an agent. Finally, in December 1962, Skripov instructed Marshall to take a package to a contact in Adelaide. The package, which was inspected by ASIO agents, was said to contain: a device used to compress data into short, high-speed signals, when attached to a radio transmitter and; coded transmission timetables for a Soviet radio station. While Marshall took the reassembled package to the rendezvous as requested, Skripov's contact did not attend. On 7 February 1963, while Kurdyukov was on sick leave in Moscow, the Australian government released photos of meetings between Skripov and Marshall, accused Skripov of being a spy and sent the Soviet embassy a note declaring Skripov persona non grata due to \\"elaborate preparations for espionage\\"; he was given seven days to leave the country. The Australian government didn't divulge what secrets Skripov may have been seeking, but it was reported that workers at the Woomera missile range underwent interrogation. The Soviet authorities responded by stating that the material proved nothing and were produced to hinder the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Australia. Kurdyukov did not return to Canberra.Cain, The Australian Security Intelligence Organization, pp.198-199 On 9 July 1968, Kurdyukov was appointed as Ambassador of the Soviet Union to Uganda, and presented his credentials to President of Uganda Milton Obote in Kampala on 5 October 1968. Kurdyukov held the post until 29 March 1972, when he retired.http://www.knowbysight.info/KKK/03552.asp References 1911 births 1977 deaths Ambassadors of the Soviet Union to Australia Ambassadors of the Soviet Union to Uganda Communist Party of the Soviet Union members ","title":"Ivan Kurdyukov"},{"id":"23845752","text":"Long Is the Road may refer to: * Long Is the Road (film), a 1948 German film * Long Is the Road (Am√©ricain) ","title":"Long Is the Road"},{"id":"23845764","title":"Thujaplicin"},{"id":"23845801","text":"Graham Newcater (born September 3, 1941) is a South African composer of serial music (twelve tone music).

Although the 1870 Tramways Act authorised local authorities to construct tramways, it prevented them from operating tram services, so the tramways were leased out to private companies who operated them on their behalf. Those companies also had the right to construct their own tramways. At its greatest extent, in 1900, the Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company operated services over 140 route miles, using 515 trams and 5,244 horses housed in 19 depots across the region. The company continued to operate tram services until the end of March 1903, shortly after which it went into liquidation.  History  The origins of local transport in Manchester and Salford can be traced back to John Greenwood (I) (1788‚Äì1851), who, in 1824, began what is believed to be the first omnibus service in the country, running between Pendleton, in Salford, to Manchester. It was such a success that within 25 years there were over 60 similar omnibuses vying for passengers on the main road into Manchester. Greenwood's son, John Greenwood (II) (1818‚Äì1886), inherited the business on his father's death in 1851, by which time the business owned almost 200 horses. Mounting competition, led to negotiations between the main rivals and on 1 March 1865, the Manchester Carriage Company was formed, with John Greenwood (II) as its first managing director. The company brought together a number of coach and omnibus proprietors, of which the Greenwood family were the largest. When the Tramways Act 1870 became law, the neighbouring councils of Manchester and Salford entered into negotiations for the provision of a tramway connecting the two towns. In 1875 powers were granted for construction to begin and, on Friday 18 May 1877 public services commenced. As the 1870 Act precluded operation of tramways by local authorities, the services were operated on behalf of the two town councils by the Manchester Carriage Company. This restriction was later removed by the 1886 Tramways Act, and both authorities made plans to seek powers to operate the tramways themselves. The Manchester Carriage Company's lease of the Salford lines expired in 1898, but they were granted an extension so that the lease expired at the same time as that of neighbouring Manchester, on 27 April 1901. In 1880, a further consolidation took place, creating the Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company from a merger of the Manchester Carriage Company and the Manchester Suburban Tramways Company. Both companies had largely the same directors, so the merger allowed them to regularise their position. The enabling Act of Parliament allowed the new company to construct new tramways in and around Manchester and Salford, and to operate the tramways built by the local authorities on their behalf. The Company's first directors were the directors of the old Manchester Carriage Company: John Greenwood, Charles Sydney Grundy, Robert Neill, Benjamin Whitworth, James Holden, John Haworth, and Daniel Busby. Each was required to have a personal stake in the new company of at least ¬£1,000 (about ¬£ as of ). John Eades (designer of L53) was manager of the Manchester Carriage Company's coachbuilding works at Ford Lane, Pendleton, Salford from 1867 until 1903. By 1882 the company was offering services on more than of track, of which it had built itself, leased from Manchester Corporation, from Salford, and from Oldham. For the lease of the Manchester tramways alone, the Company paid Manchester Corporation ¬£16,000 per annum (about ¬£ as of 2014). At its greatest extent in 1900, the company operated services over 140 route miles in Manchester, Salford, Patricroft, Oldham, Stalybridge and Stockport, using 515 trams, 5,244 horses, and 19 depots organised into 8 operating divisions. As the 19th century drew to a close, many corporations obtained permission to take over local tramways and run them as Corporation transport. This coincided with the introduction of electricity, and the possibility of replacement of the horse-powered tramways. In the event, due to a misunderstanding in the valuation of the company's assets, Salford Corporation was unable to conclude its takeover of services in its area, until 1 May 1901. The following day, the corporation acquired 94 of the company's horse-tramcars, along with 906 horses; the first Salford Corporation operated tramcar service left Pendleton at 4:30 am that morning. The company continued to operate horse tram services from Manchester to Hollinwood, Ashton, and Stalybridge until 31 March 1903, the last horse-drawn tramcars in Manchester. The company was liquidated in 1903, and its assets, amounting to ¬£1,167,965 (about ¬£ as of ) were distributed to its shareholders. That same year a private vehicle hire operation, The Manchester Carriage Company (1903) was formed, led by John Greenwood (III). This company survived into the 1970s, based at one time in Middleton, and later in Rusholme.  Depots and works  The company had 19 depots: * Ford Lane Works & Head Office, Pendleton * Church St, Pendleton * Higher Broughton * Bradford, Manchester * Harpurhey, Manchester * Newton Heath, Manchester * Lower Broughton Road * Crumpsall, Manchester * Rusholme, Manchester (Moss Lane East) * Hollinwood, Oldham * Cowhill La, Ashton * Stockport Road, Longsight * Openshaw, Manchester * Grey Street, Longsight * Weaste, Salford * Chorlton Road, Manchester (Hulme) * Stretford, Manchester * All Saints, Manchester * Withington Road, Manchester (Range Road, Whalley Range) * Collyhurst (Queens Park), Manchester Surviving vehicles=L2= L2 at the Museum of Transport, Greater Manchester.

L53 is the only surviving complete horse tram, from over 500 designed by John Eades in 1877 and built by the Company to operate in and around the city until 1903. Built to the Eades patent Reversible type, the tram is unique among all surviving trams in that it uses the horses' own power to turn the body of the tram round on its underframe when reaching the end of the tracks. Rescued from a retirement near Glossop Derbyshire, that included use as a hairdresser's and a fish and chip shop, the tram was restored over a 25-year period by a team of skilled volunteers which included most of the side frames being made by one of the team as part of an 'A' Level woodwork exam. =173= Although not constructed by the company, this vehicle was built by Brush to the pattern of a prototype car constructed by the company, as part of a series of prototypes built by a number of different manufacturers to find the most suitable types for Manchester use.

It premiered on the Fox network on October 25, 1996. The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter, and directed by David Nutter. \\"Pilot\\" featured guest appearances by Paul Dillon, April Telek and Stephen J. Lang. Offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), a member of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group, retires to Seattle with his family after a breakdown caused him to quit working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Using his incredible profiling skills, Black helps in an effort to catch a vicious murderer who believes he is fulfilling apocalyptic prophecies. \\"Pilot\\" was filmed over the course of a month in Vancouver, British Columbia, and was inspired by the writings of Nostradamus and William Butler Yeats. Airing in the timeslot previously occupied by Carter's first series, The X-Files, the episode received a high Nielsen household and syndication rating and was generally positively received by fans and critics alike.  Plot  In a strip club in downtown Seattle, an unnamed man known to the club workers as \\"The Frenchman\\" (Paul Dillon) is mumbling poetic phrases and hallucinating blood pouring over a blonde stripper, with a wall of fire surrounding her. Later that night, the stripper is murdered. Just arriving in Seattle is Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and his family. Frank spots a newspaper about the local murder, and immediately contacts his old colleague Bob Bletcher. Frank joins the investigation as an advisor of the Millennium Group, a private investigative group composed of retired law enforcement agents. When he views the body, Frank gets various vivid visions of the crime. His knowledge of various details unknown to the others unsettles Bletcher. Frank and a fellow member of the Millennium Group named Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) officially join the investigation. In the meantime, the killer is hunting for his next victim. While unknown to him, the murderer is trapped in a world of grotesque hallucinations. Later that night, local police officers spot his latest victim. Frank visits the crime scene, which gives him a vision of the crime, again startling his colleague Bletcher. Later on, Frank presents his finding to the local homicide department, saying that the murderer is obsessed with apocalyptic prophecies and maddened by twisted sexual guilt. After Frank presents his finding, Bletcher demands Frank give him the stripper girl's \\"rape & murder on VHS.\\" Frank tells him he can see what the killer sees. After telling him, Frank rushes to hospital when his daughter, Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is stricken with a high fever. Getting another vision, Frank leaves the hospital and gathers local law enforcement officers to another victim. This follows with Frank tracking down the killer to the local police department's own evidence lab. In a mad rage the killer attacks Frank, but Bletcher shows up and shoots the killer, saving Frank's life. After clearing up the case with the local authorities, Frank returns home and opens up a newly arrived anonymous piece of mail containing pictures of his family.  Production  \\"Pilot\\" was written by series creator Chris Carter. Beyond creating the concept for Millennium, Carter would write a total of six other episodes for the series in addition to \\"Gehenna\\"‚Äîthree in the first season, and a further three in the third season. Director David Nutter would also go on to direct several episodes in the first season of the series‚Äî\\"Gehenna\\", \\"522666\\" and \\"Loin Like a Hunting Flame\\". \\"Pilot\\" was filmed over the course of a month, which was an unheard-of length of time for a single television episode. The episode was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia in early spring to give it a \\"gray\\" and \\"bleak\\" look. The decision to film in Vancouver was to give the show the same dark feel as its sister show The X-Files, which had also been created by Carter. The strip club, Ruby Tip, was inspired by a club in Seattle named the Lusty Lady, which is located on that city's main street. Director David Nutter had been a long-time staff member of The X-Files crew. Carter said the episode was \\"directed beautifully by David Nutter who added to the project in so many ways, even as it came on, things that he saw visually that were able to actually change and make the script more concise\\". Although \\"Pilot\\" did not open with a literary quote as the series would do from the next episode onwards, its plot heavily features the 1919 poem \\"The Second Coming\\" by Irish poet William Butler Yeats.Genge, pp.130‚Äì131 Carter called it a \\"pleasure\\" to cast Kate Luyben and April Telek, because they were \\"good\\"-looking, which he felt was a refreshing change from frequently casting \\"character actors\\" on The X-Files. Luyben would later make an appearance on The X-Files and played a prominent role on Harsh Realm. The idea behind the character \\"The Frenchman\\" came from a prophecy by Nostradamus. According to Carter, \\"the idea that there is something approaching at the millennium, this series being produced I think four years before the end of the century, that we were headed toward something grave and foreboding\\". The name of recurring character Bob Bletcher came from an attorney Carter had worked with previously. Another name, Giebelhouse was another name Carter had gotten from his childhood years. Carter said \\"This idea of the hard-boiled detective is a kind of clich√©\\". But felt that the characters came \\"very real to life\\", when compared to real law enforcement personnel. Millennium was given the Friday night timeslot previously occupied by The X-Files, prompting Carter to quip that his earlier series was \\"being abducted\\". However, Millennium received higher viewing figures during its first season than The X-Files had done, while the latter show's fourth season, the one airing concurrently to Millennium, saw its ratings reach their highest to that point.Genge, pp. 8‚Äì9  Broadcast and reception  \\"Pilot\\" was first broadcast on the Fox network on October 25, 1996; and gathered a total viewership of 17.72 million in the United States. In the \\"adults 18‚Äì49\\" demographic, the episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9, with a 27 share; meaning it was viewed by nine percent of television-equipped households and 27 percent of those actively watching television. The rating across all demographics was 11.9.Genge, p. xiii The episode's broadcast set the record at the time for the most-watched program on Fox. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handeln rated the episode a B, finding it to be \\"weirdly prescient of the crime dramas we wallow in today\\". Handlen felt that episode's tone was so \\"overwrought\\" as to be \\"hilarious\\", but still found the series to be \\"uncompromising\\" and \\"compelling\\". Handlen also noted similarities to the films Manhunter and Seven in both the episode's plot and the series' premise. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 5/5, calling it \\"perhaps the most perfect opening episode to a one-hour suspense thriller ... ever conceived\\". Gibron also praised the casting of Henriksen and O'Quinn in the series. An Entertainment Weekly preview for the episode noted that some of its scenes were \\"the grimmest ... in prime-time history\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, calling it \\"bleak and confrontational\\" though finding that its symbolism was \\"too boldly stated\\". Comparing the series to its sister show, The X-Files, Shearman and Pearson noted that Henriksen portrays his role \\"with a confidence that makes him immediately a more credible character than Mulder or Scully would be for an entire season\\".Shearman and Pearson, pp. 105‚Äì106 Writing for The Register-Guard, Renee Graham called the episode \\"as lurid a television show as you're ever going to see\\", adding that it seemed \\"just too horrific to be enjoyable\\". However, Graham noted that the episode was \\"by far the superior show\\" compared to the similar series Profiler, which aired around the same time.

Offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), a member of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group, is sent to San Francisco to track down a doomsday cult which murders its brainwashed members when they disobey it. \\"Gehenna\\" sees both Carter and Nutter continue their roles from \\"Pilot\\", although it also necessitated changes in filming locations. The episode opens with a quote from W. H. Auden's poem \\"Blessed Event\\"‚Äîthe first of the series' opening quotations‚Äîand makes references to the Hebrew Bible's Gehenna. Plot In San Francisco, a group of young men drive to an abandoned factory, and drug one of their members with LSD, leaving him to be torn apart by what he perceives to be a monster. Later, a large quantity of suspicious ash found in a nearby park is proven to be from human remains. A private investigative organisation, the Millennium Group, dispatches offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate the multiple homicide that led to this. Black believes that the victims were burnt alive; while chemical analysis of the ash leads the Group to the same factory. In Black's home in Seattle, his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) confides in policeman Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) her worry about Black's overprotective nature, fearing he may quit his job if he believes his family to be in danger. Catherine does not yet know that a stalker from their past has resurfaced and has been posting polaroids of the family to Black. Black has meanwhile been persuaded by his fellow Group member Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell) that his family is in no immediate risk. Back in San Francisco, dental records matched to teeth found in the ashes lead to a young immigrant who vanished six months prior, having joined a doomsday cult. Elsewhere, this cult is seen operating as telemarketers, working in a large assembly hall as propaganda slogans are projected onto the walls around them. One of the members is apprehended by Black, and during his interrogation it becomes clear that the cult, fronting as Gehenna Industries, is brainwashing its terrified members, incinerating those who disobey. Black returns to Seattle, researching Gehenna Industries from his home. He uncovers a warehouse address belonging to the cult, which Atkins investigates. The warehouse is full of cached weaponry, stockpiled for the cult's doomsday predictions. The cult's leader lures Atkins into the industrial microwave which has been used to immolate the victims, but the police arrive in time to save him, having been tipped off by Black that Atkins may be in danger. The weapons stockpile allows the police to bring down the cult, but Black is certain that their influence is still a threat. Production The Valley of Hinnom, the source of the episode's title \\"Gehenna\\" is the second episode of the series directed by David Nutter, who had previously helmed \\"Pilot\\".

Gehinnom was a location referred to in the Hebrew Bible where children were sacrificed by burning to the Canaanite god Moloch; this ritual sacrifice echoes the cremation of the victims in the episode.Genge, pp. 16‚Äì17 The building used for exterior shots of the Black family's home is different from the one seen in \\"Pilot\\"; the earlier house was located in an expensive neighbourhood whose residents had decided not to allow filming to continue there. The new location chosen was one which had already been used in Millennium sister show The X-Files, appearing in that series' second episode \\"Deep Throat\\".

Writing for The A.V. Club, Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode a C+, finding that it was \\"almost completely crippled by ... self- seriousness\\". VanDerWerff felt that the episode reflected Millennium seeming simultaneously both \\"intrinsically of the 1990s\\" and \\"ahead of its time\\", find that its treatment of \\"the dread and shadowy fear and sense that the world held several cloaked and mysterious evils for well-to-do Americans\\" was a symptom of 1990s preoccupation with \\"the end of the world\\" while foreshadowing the mood of the United States following the September 11 attacks in New York in 2001. As a result, VanDerWerff described the episode, and the series, as being \\"the first post-Sept. 11 show\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting that there is \\"more here than just your standard serial killer show\\". Gibron praised the episode's \\"atypical storyline\\", which he felt was achieved through \\"some suggestive effects and wonderful crosscutting\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it \\"a somewhat humdrum story\\". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's core premise‚Äîthat of \\"a telemarking company being a front for a terrorist cult\\"‚Äîwas intriguing, but that the \\"millennial flavour\\" that accompanies this resulted in the episode seeming \\"a little confused\\".Shearman and Pearson, pp. 106‚Äì107  Notes Footnotes=References= External links Millennium (season 1) episodes 1996 American television episodes ","title":"Gehenna (Millennium)"},{"id":"23846147","text":"\\"'Dead Letters\\" is the third episode of the first season of the American crime-thriller television series Millennium. It premiered on the Fox network on November 8, 1996. The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed by Thomas J. Wright. \\"Dead Letters\\" featured guest appearances by Chris Ellis, Ron Halder and James Morrison. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is sent to evaluate a prospective member of the group, who perform private investigative work and liaise with law enforcement. Meeting this hopeful member, Jim Horn (Morrison), Black is drawn to investigate a serial killer operating in the area; while Horn begins to unravel under the strain of the case. Several of the cast and crew made their first contributions to the series in \\"Dead Letters\\", with Wright, Morgan, Wong and Ellis all returning for future episodes. Production of \\"Dead Letters\\" impressed other series regulars‚Äîseries writer Chip Johannessen praised the script's attention to detail, while producer John Peter Kousaskis called positive attention to its physical and make-up effects. Plot Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is awakened by a nightmare, and is comforted by her father Frank Black (Lance Henriksen). However, Black is soon called to investigate the body of a woman at a dog pound in Portland, Oregon. Black works for the Millennium Group, an organisation which offers private investigation services and consults with law enforcement on certain types of cases. He is asked by Group member Jim Penseyres (Chris Ellis) to help a local detective on the murder case, as he is being considered as prospective member of the Millennium Group. Black believes the murder to be the work of a serial killer, and is convinced there will be a message from him on the bodies. Black meets up with the detective, Jim Horn (James Morrison), and sees that he is a competent and experienced investigator, although his recent separation from his wife has left him distracted and on edge. The killer murders another woman, disposing of the body in a post office's dead letter office. Investigating, Black finds a human hair with a message etched into it‚Äî\\"hair today, gone tomorrow\\"‚Äîwhich he takes as an indication that the murderer is lashing out at a world that he feels has treated him as insignificant. Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability. A third victim turns up, with another message‚Äî\\"nothing ventured, nothing gained\\". A lens from the killer's glasses is also recovered. Black organises a press release in an attempt to draw out the killer, taunting his intelligence by including a falsified profile describing him as uneducated. Black and Horn feel this will tempt the killer to show up at the latest victim's memorial service. Horn attacks an innocent man at the service, believing him to be the killer; although a cross found at the memorial with \\"ventured\\" etched upon it proves the killer did attend. Surveillance footage of the service yields two leads‚Äîa local optician recognizes the suspect as a customer having a glasses lens replaced, and the killer's vehicle is identified. Black and Horn realize that the killer will have chosen the optician as his next victim, and agree to set another trap with her as the bait. Horn, more and more unhinged throughout the case, begins imagining the killer and his van at every turn. As he and Black wait for the killer to make an attempt on the optician's life, Horn admits that he cannot trust himself to be there, and is told to go home. However, he parks his car on the route towards the trap, feigning a flat tyre. When the killer's van attempts to pass, Horn attacks him, but the police arrive in time to stop him beating the killer to death. The attack renders any evidence found in the van inadmissible in court, although Black tells him enough evidence was found at the killer's home to secure a conviction. Later, Horn asks Black how he can deal with cases like this on a regular basis. Black does not answer, but later comforts his daughter after another bad dream. Production \\"Dead Letters\\" is the first episode of Millennium to be written by James Wong and Glen Morgan, who would go on to write another fourteen episodes across the first and second seasons. The episode is also the first not to have been written by series creator Chris Carter, who had penned both of the preceding episodes, \\"Pilot\\" and \\"Gehenna\\". \\"Dead Letters\\" also marked the first time Thomas J. Wright had directed an episode of the series. Wright would go on to direct twenty-six episodes across all three seasons, as well as directing \\"Millennium\\", the series' crossover episode with its sister show The X-Files. He had also previously worked with Morgan and Wong on their series Space: Above and Beyond. The episode marked the second of three appearances by Chris Ellis as Millennium Group member Jim Penseyres; Ellis had previously appeared in \\"Gehenna\\", and would reappear in the next episode, \\"The Judge\\". Guest star James Morrison, who portrayed the troubled Jim Horn, had also previously appeared as a main character in Morgan and Wong's Space: Above and Beyond, playing Tyrus Cassius McQueen; his character's son in this episode is named TC as a reference to this.Genge, p. 27 Lisa Vultaggio, who played the optician used to bait the killer, had previously worked with Morgan and Wong in The X-Files, appearing in the first season episode \\"Beyond the Sea\\". Producer and writer Chip Johannessen felt that the scene in this episode in which a human hair is discovered with a message inscribed upon it was a \\"perfect\\" moment, in that it \\"told you everything about this guy [the killer] ... but you had no idea what he was or what he was going to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows\\". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming.Genge, p. 28 Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing \\"fabulous\\" work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked \\"we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous\\". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself. Reception \\"Dead Letters\\" was first broadcast on the Fox Network on November 8, 1996;Shearman and Pearson, p. 107 and earned a Nielsen rating of 8, meaning that roughly of all television-equipped households were tuned in to the episode.Genge, p. xviii \\"Dead Letters\\" earned positive reviews from critics. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B+. Handlen felt that the episode is \\"not art, not yet, but it is deeply personal\\", and praised the opening dream sequence, describing it as \\"flat-out Lynchian nightmare territory\\". However, he noted that the episode's dialogue felt too \\"flat\\" and \\"expository\\", adding that it serves to draw \\"attention to themes that were already plastered across the screen in blinding red and black\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4 out of 5, describing it as being \\"one of the more horrifying episodes in Season 1\\". Gibron added that \\"seeing Jim Horn go through his mental breakdown gives us insight into where Frank Black is coming from\\", although he felt that the lack of real insight into the killer's personality let the episode down. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, describing it as a \\"gripping and sincere portrait of human ugliness at its most banal\\".

The ship and her frustrated captain were still stuck in Mozambique when they were found in February 1507‚Äîalmost exactly one year after Flor do Mar left India‚Äîby the outgoing 8th India armada under the command of Trist√£o da Cunha.Jo√£o de Barros (1552‚Äì59) D√©cadas da √Åsia, vol. 3, p.17-18 Cunha ordered his crews to help repair the ship back to seaworthy shape, unload the ship's spice cargo onto another Portugal-bound transport (under the command of Ant√≥nio de Saldanha) and then annexed the empty Flor do Mar and her captain into his own India-bound armada. She was never to return to Portugal. Flor do Mar and her captain Jo√£o da Nova participated in Cunha's conquest of Socotra. In the aftermath, to Nova's surprise, Cunha ordered her to remain in the western Arabian Sea, integrated into the patrol squadron of Afonso de Albuquerque. Nova and the ship participated in the Albuquerque-led conquest of the cities of Curiati (Kuryat), Muscat in July 1507, Khor Fakkan, (accepting also the submission of the cities of Kalhat and Sohar) and Ormuz in the same year. Two years later in India, she was commandeered to serve as the flagship of D. Francisco de Almeida in the 1509 battle of Diu. Jo√£o da Nova died that same year in Cochin, and Almeida (ending his term as vice-roy) planned to bring Flor do Mar back to Portugal himself, taking special care to repair her into shape. But his successor, Afonso de Albuquerque, forbade it and retained the ship in India, giving Almeida another ship to take home instead.Barros, p.333 Under Afonso de Albuquerque's orders, Flor do Mar supported the conquest of Goa in 1510 as well as the conquest of Malacca in 1511. = Capacity = A replica of Flor do Mar, Maritime Museum of Malacca. Flor do Mar's longevity was remarkable. At a time when India ships were built for only three or four years of useful service, Flor do Mar was one of the longest-lasting ships of the India run. However, her service as a cargo ship left a lot to be desired. Dangerously unseaworthy when fully loaded, she only completed one full India run, and not without difficulties. Nonetheless, much was learned from the ship's experience. Although several larger ships‚Äî600t, 900t, 1500t‚Äîwould be occasionally built, the average India nau would hover around 400‚Äì450t. As such, Flor do Mar can be considered the prototype of what would become the typical 16th-century India nau. The ship's experience also led to the institutionalisation of the \\"outer route\\", i.e. captains of heavy-laden large ships were ordered to avoid returning via the fast Mozambique Channel, but rather sail a longer but calmer course east of Madagascar. = Shipwreck = Despite already being deemed unsafe, Flor do Mar served to support the conquest of Malacca, then the largest commercial center of the East Indies. Given her large capacity, Afonso de Albuquerque decided to use the ship to transport the vast treasure looted from the Sultan of Malacca's palace back to Portugal.Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius (1977). Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415‚Äì1580, p.260 When Flor do Mar came out of Malacca in late 1511 and sailed along the north-east Sumatran state of Pas√©, in the Strait of Malacca, she was caught in a storm and wrecked on some shoals, causing numerous casualties.Pires, Tom√©, Armando Cortes√£o, Francisco Rodrigues (1990), The Suma oriental of Tome Pires, 1512-1515, Laurier Books Ltd. p. 146. The ship did not survive the storm and sank during the night of 20 November 1511, off Timia Point in the Kingdom of Aru, Sumatra.Mohd.

It premiered on the Fox network on November 15, 1996. The episode was written by Ted Mann, and directed by Randall Zisk. \\"The Judge\\" featured guest appearances by Marshall Bell, John Hawkes and C. C. H. Pounder. Forensic profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), a member of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group, is asked to investigate a vigilante (Bell) who uses newly released convicts to execute those he deems guilty. \\"The Judge\\" begins with a quotation from Moby-Dick, a novel that the episode has been compared to thematically. Guest star Pounder would reappear several times in the series, while fellow guest Ellis made the last of his three appearances in this episode. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Plot In a bowling alley, ex-convict Carl Nearman (J. R. Bourne) watches another man eat his meal before following him outside, where he approaches and kills him. Elsewhere, Annie Tisman (Donna White) receives a human tongue in a package. The Millennium Group sends offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and pathologist Cheryl Andrews (C. C. H. Pounder) to investigate, as several people have received body parts in the post over the past few years. No connection between the recipients has been found, nor have the bodies the parts have been culled from. Mike Bardale (John Hawkes) is a violent recidivist who has recently been released from prison again. He is approached by a man calling himself The Judge (Marshall Bell), who offers Bardale a position in his \\"court\\". The Judge is a vigilante, hiring convicts to mete out his version of justice against those he perceives as criminals. Bardale's first \\"execution\\" is that of his forebear, Nearman. The body of the man killed outside the bowling alley is discovered, missing a tongue. It is identified as a retired police officer, Detective Mellen, who had given false testimony that had sent Annie Tisman's late husband to prison. Black realizes that the killer is motivated by the need to right wrongs such as this, killing those who have gotten away with crimes. Meanwhile, The Judge passes sentence on another victim‚Äîa slumlord whose negligence caused a tenant's death. Bardale is ordered to cut the landlord's leg off while he is still alive; the leg is later found in a postal depot in a package. Forensic evidence on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing that there is not enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs. Production \\"The Judge\\" is the first of four episodes of Millennium to be written by Ted Mann, who would go on to write \\"Loin Like a Hunting Flame\\", \\"Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions\\" and the first-season finale \\"Paper Dove\\". The episode marks director Randall Zisk's only work for the series. The episode features the first appearance by C. C. H. Pounder as Millennium Group pathologist Cheryl Andrews. Pounder would go on to make another four appearances as the character, appearing across all three seasons.Genge, p. 102 \\"The Judge\\" also marked the final appearance by Chris Ellis as Group member Jim Penseyres; Ellis had previously appeared in \\"Gehenna\\"Genge, p. 12 and \\"Dead Letters\\".Genge, p. 22 John Hawkes, who portrays killer Mike Bardale in the episode, would later go on to work with Mann again on the series Deadwood, first reuniting on that series' first- season finale \\"Sold Under Sin\\". The episode opens with a quotation from Herman Melville's 1851 novel Moby-Dick, taken from chapter forty-two, \\"The Whiteness of the Whale\\". Both Millennium and Moby-Dick have been described as \\"a basic conflict between good and evil\\". In addition, both are \\"focused on a then- modern view of the world\\".Genge, p. 134 Reception \\"The Judge\\" was first broadcast on the Fox Network on November 15, 1996;Shearman and Pearson, p. 108 and earned a Nielsen rating of 7.6, meaning that roughly of all television- equipped households were tuned in to the episode.Genge, p. xviii \\"The Judge\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, finding its \\"contrived\\" plot to be \\"barely a subtle premise\\", and noting that \\"the script unfortunately elevates the lead villain to high camp\\". Shearman and Pearson felt that the subject of vigilantism was a suitable one for the series, and that it had \\"been bubbling under the surface every since the concept of the Millennium Group ... was first mentioned\\"; however, they ultimately felt that the episode contained \\"very little to engage the brain\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated \\"The Judge\\" 4 out of 5, describing it as being \\"a fine, moody episode\\". However, Gibron felt that Marshall Bell's character may have been better suited to a recurring role, rather than being killed off during the episode. Writing for The A.V. Club, Emily Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B-, praising the acting of both Bell and John Hawkes. However, VanDerWerff felt that \\"The Judge\\" showed Millennium to be struggling with its own concept, growing \\"staid\\" as a result of only having \\"the one color to play with\\".

It premiered on the Fox network on November 22, 1996. The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed by David Nutter. \\"522666\\" featured guest appearances by Sam Anderson, Hiro Kanagawa and Joe Chrest. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is approached by the FBI when a series of bombs are detonated in Washington, DC. Black's investigation soon reveals that the culprit seeks to be seen as a hero, setting off explosions in order to rescue people from the scenes; leaving Black to track down the fame-hungry bomber before more people are killed. \\"522666\\" was one of many collaborations between Nutter, Morgan and Wong, with the three having worked together on several television series previously. The episode opens with a reference to existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, and featured Henriksen performing all of his own stunts. Plot Outside a bar in Washington DC, Raymond Dees (Joe Chrest) calls 911 on a payphone. He says nothing, simply typing the numbers 522666 on the phone's keypad. Later, he watches the bar from a parking garage nearby, masturbating as the bomb he has left inside detonates. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) watches the aftermath of the explosion on the news, knowing that the group will ask for his assistance with the case. Dees is among the rescuers seen on the broadcast. Black travels to DC and meets up with fellow group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). The two join the FBI task force investigating the bombing, led by special agents Pierson (Sam Anderson) and Takahashi (Hiro Kanagawa). Watts and Black quickly dismiss several false claims of responsibility by terrorist groups. Black listens to the 911 call left by Dees, deducing that the numbers dialled spell the word kaboom on a telephone keypad. Black and the FBI investigate the crime scene; Black not only realises the bomber's proficiency with explosives, but is able to work out that he viewed the bombing from the parking garage. In a bin in the garage, they find a tissue covered in Dees' semen. Black informs the FBI that the bomber is smart enough to be able to tap into their phonecalls, and volunteers to bait him into eavesdropping on his mobile phone. Black's deduction is correct, and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning. The FBI task force rush to locate the bomb, tracing the phonecall to a small section of the city that might house it. Scanning the area, Black notices another parking garage opposite an office block, and attempts to have the building evacuated. However, Dees has planted a second bomb which detonates fifteen minutes early, while Black is inside the building. However, he is pulled to safety by a stranger, who is interviewed on the news following the explosion‚ÄîRaymond Dees. Black comes to in a hospital bed, tended to by his wife Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher). She explains to him what has happened, and turns on the evening news to show him the interview with his rescuer. However, watching Dees speak, Black quickly realises he is the bomber. The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped before they even arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black know that he has a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman. When Black's car is searched, it is clear it was never rigged with anything‚ÄîDees had planned the whole thing, knowing that he would be killed. As news reports spread concerning the bomber's identity and his death at the hands of the police, Black sees that Dees has achieved the fame he longed for. Production Henriksen performed his own stunts in \\"522666\\". \\"522666\\" was directed by David Nutter, who had directed both \\"Pilot\\" and \\"Gehenna\\" previously, and would also direct \\"Loin Like a Hunting Flame\\" later in the season. Writers James Wong and Glen Morgan had previously written \\"Dead Letters\\", and would go on to write an additional thirteen episodes during the first and second seasons of the series. Nutter, Morgan and Wong had all previously collaborated on both Millennium sister show The X-Files,Edwards, p. 48 and the Morgan and Wong- created series Space: Above and Beyond. Guest star Hiro Kanagawa, who portrays FBI special agent Takahashi, has appeared several times in Millennium sister show The X-Files, in the secondEdwards, p. 106 and fourth seasons;Edwards, p. 212 as well as in The X-Files spin-off series The Lone Gunmen. Kanagawa would also make several more appearances on Millennium, acting in unrelated roles in the episodes \\"The Time Is Now\\", \\"Human Essence\\", and \\"Bardo Thodol\\". The episode also featured a guest appearance by William MacDonald as FBI Agent Nolan; MacDonald would later reappear in the third season episode \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\". Lance Henriksen performed all his own stunts in this episode, having been introduced to acting by a stuntman friend of his.Genge, p. 60 The episode opens with a quote from French existentialist philosopher and writer Jean-Paul Sartre‚Äî\\"I am responsible for everything... except my very responsibility\\", which was taken from the 1943 treatise Being and Nothingness. Sarte's writing echoes the motivations of the character of Raymond Dees, with author N. E.

The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode a B-, finding that the episode's 'cat and mouse' chase between Black and Dees was \\"well constructed\\" and \\"exciting\\", and drawing comparisons between the episode and the film Seven. However, he felt that the ending was poor, and that Megan Gallagher's portrayal of Catherine Black let the episode down. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3 out of 5, finding that the focus on technological investigative techniques was \\"decidedly dull\\", and that although the episode's premise was initially \\"interesting\\", it grew \\"derivative after a while\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, note that the episode's premise is the first in the series \\"to play it entirely straight\\", avoiding Black's paranormal abilities.

Forensic profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), a member of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group, chases a serial killer who targets clerics and holy men due to his frustration with his own faith. \\"Kingdom Come\\" marked the first contributions to the series by Zamacona and Kolbe, who would both return for future episodes. The original broadcast date set for \\"Kingdom Come\\" was pushed back several weeks, as it was felt by the network that it would be in poor taste following the death of Chicago archbishop Joseph Bernardin. Plot When a Catholic priest is burnt at the stake in Tacoma, Washington, private investigative organisation the Millennium Group despatch offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Ardis Cohen (Lindsay Crouse) who had previously worked together on a case involving the murders of three clerics several years earlier. Black sees similarities between the murders and the methods of torture employed by the medieval Inquisition. This is confirmed when a Protestant minister is drowned in imitation of another ritual torture. At the scene of the drowning, two wedding rings are found‚Äîa man's in the stomach of the victim and woman's nearby. At a church, the killer is searching through files when he is interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied fingerprints at the scene. Black constructs a profile of the man, and deduces that his actions are attacks on faith, believing that the killer has suffered a devastating loss which has caused him to lose his own faith. As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the killer has returned to where his life fell apart. He and the police are able to identify the killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had been killed in a house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral. Calloway enters the church wielding explosives, taking the congregation hostage. The building is quickly surrounded by police and reporters as Calloway gives a sermon to his hostages about the loss of faith. Black believes he can connect with Calloway, and is allowed to enter the church. Calloway is initially hostile, but Black is able to talk him down, convincing Calloway that his faith has not been lost, but simply tested‚Äîdespite all that has happened, Calloway has never lost his belief in God. Realizing the truth of this, Calloway surrenders. Production alt=A grey stone mausoleum surrounded by a green lawn. \\"Kingdom Come\\" is the first of two episodes of Millennium to be written by Jorge Zamacona, who would also pen the later season one episode \\"The Wild and the Innocent\\". The episode also marks the first of four directorial credits for Winrich Kolbe, who would also take the reins on \\"Force Majeure\\", \\"Lamentation\\" and \\"Broken World\\", all in the first season. Guest actor Laurie Murdoch, who portrayed one of the murdered priests in the episode, would later return in the third season episode \\"TEOTWAWKI\\", in an unrelated role. Fellow guest Tom McBeath, who played a detective investigating the case, would also reappear in the third season, playing a prosecution lawyer in \\"Omert√†\\". The episode opens with a quotation taken from the Book of Exodus, the second book of the Hebrew Bible, and one of the five books that make up the Torah. The passage used is Exodus 10:21, \\"And there will be such intense darkness, that one can feel it\\". Biblical verses were also used at the beginning of other episodes in the series, including the Book of Job in \\"Wide Open\\" and \\"Dead Letters\\"; the Book of Jeremiah in \\"Weeds\\"; and the Gospel of Luke in \\"Blood Relatives\\". \\"Kingdom Come\\" was the fourth episode of the series produced, postponed from its original broadcast date to be the sixth episode aired. Fox Broadcasting Company announced that the reason for this was that it would be \\"in poor taste\\" to run an episode involving the murder of clergymen soon after the death of Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, the Archbishop of Chicago. However, it was rumoured at the time that the postponement may simply have been a way to draw attention to the series, as its ratings had begun to fall. According to Lance Henriksen, the original episode script called for Black to be confirmed as an atheist, but he refused to deliver the lines confirming this because he did not want Black's response as the hero to such a complex and important question to be simplified. Broadcast and reception \\"Kingdom Come\\" was first broadcast on the Fox Network on November 29, 1996; and earned a Nielsen rating of 7.2, meaning that roughly of all television-equipped households were tuned in to the episode. The episode was watched by approximately households. \\"Kingdom Come\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, calling it \\"a particularly superficial addition to the series\\". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's lack of complexity was refreshing, but ultimately the \\"awkward\\" performances and \\"cheesy\\" approach to its subject matter detracted from it. Writing for The A.V. Club, Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode a B, describing it as \\"an episode about a man who finds himself trying to lose his faith but being unable to do so\\". VanDerWerff felt that the episode suffered from \\"the typical Millennium problems\\", including \\"an overreliance on trite philosophical dialogue\\"; however, she found that it contained \\"something pure and believable at its core that keeps the episode moving along nicely\\". The episode's thematic concern with the role of religion in society was noted as being \\"the tension Millennium would build its best episodes on\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated \\"Kingdom Come\\" 5 out of 5, describing it as being \\"classic Millennium\\". Gibron felt that the episode had \\"an exceptional script that delightfully fails to spell everything out for us up front\\", and noted that it served as \\"the blueprint for all better Millennium episodes to come\\".  Notes Footnotes=References=  External links Millennium (season 1) episodes 1996 American television episodes ","title":"Kingdom Come (Millennium)"},{"id":"23846188","text":"Blood Relatives (original French title: Les Liens de sang) is a 1978 Canadian- French mystery film directed by Claude Chabrol from a screenplay that he and Sydney Banks adapted from the 1975 novel of the same name by Ed McBain. Set in Montreal, Canada, it involves the brutal murder of a teenage girl and the subsequent investigation led by Donald Sutherland as Steve Carella, the lead character of McBain's 87th Precinct series. Blood Relatives was filmed under a policy that allowed full tax deferment to foreign produced films if they reflected a specific portrait of Canada. For this reason, the novel's setting of a thinly-veiled New York City is changed to Montreal. Synopsis One rainy night a teenage girl called Patricia staggers wounded into a police station saying that she and her older cousin Muriel, who lived in her family home, had been brutally attacked with a knife in a dark alley. The police find the mutilated body of the attractive Muriel. Patricia describes the assailant to them, but in an identity parade picks out a policeman. Led by Inspector Carella, the investigation tries to find out who might have wanted to kill an apparently normal girl from an apparently normal family. A possible clue comes at the funeral, when Patricia's brother Andrew in grief throws himself on the coffin of his dead cousin. Patricia then tells Carella that it was Andrew who had murdered Muriel, his motive being that she had been sleeping with him but left him for her married boss, and had tried to kill Patricia as the only witness. The proof, she says, was in Muriel's diary. When found by the police, the diary confirms Patricia's second story, insofar as Muriel did switch her affections from Andrew to her boss, but it also records a violent encounter between an evasive Muriel and an angry Andrew which formed the basis of Patricia's first story. After repeated lying, the girl admits that she was lethally jealous of the sexier Muriel, who she felt had stolen the love of her brother. After killing her horribly, she wounded herself to give credibility to her story.

It premiered on the Fox network on December 6, 1996. The episode was written by Chip Johannessen, and directed by Jim Charleston. \\"Blood Relatives\\" featured guest appearances by John Fleck, Sean Six and Lynda Boyd. Forensic profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), a member of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group, is asked to investigate a killer who targets mourners after visiting the funerals of strangers. \\"Blood Relatives\\" saw the series' first writing credit for Johannessen, who would contribute another twelve episodes across three seasons. The episode; which opens with a quotation from the Christian Gospel of Luke; went on to receive positive reviews from critics. Plot At a funeral in Seattle, James Dickerson (Sean Six), approaches the mourning family. He introduces himself as \\"Ray Bell\\" and pretends to have known the deceased at university. He embraces the dead man's mother lingeringly, and leaves. Later that night, the mother is visiting her son's grave, and is pulled into an open grave as she passes it. Her body is found the next day, although the rest of her family have been told they cannot see it. Speaking to clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), Seattle police officer Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) reveals that the victim had been graphically mutilated during the murder. Catherine Black's husband, offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), is asked to consult on the case as a member of the Millennium Group, a private investigative organisation. Black senses that the killer feels rage towards someone‚Äînot the victim‚Äîand is taking it out on strangers. Speaking to the family, Black finds that the victim's dead son has had a sports team badge taken from his body; he also realizes that the strange \\"Ray Bell\\" must be the killer. Back at his halfway house Dickerson is wearing the missing badge, as the house's trustee Connor scolds him for breaking curfew‚Äîand threatens not to cover up for him any more. After Connor leaves, James finds an obituary in the newspaper and circles it. Elsewhere, Black finds the name \\"Ray Bell\\" in the same newspaper as the victim's son's obituary, and deduces that the killer may have been frequenting funerals before, probably taking souvenirs like the badge. He believes that the victim is his first, but that killing will become easier for him. Dickerson visits another funeral, and befriends a mourner, Tina, by pretending to have been a childhood friend of the deceased. They visit a nearby lake to reminisce, but she feels something is wrong. Dickerson apologises and leaves; however, Tina is soon attacked from behind. Her body is found with the words \\"stop looking\\" carved into her stomach, and Black believes there may be a message somewhere on the first victim's body. He asks fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to look for it; Watts is also able to find fingerprints on Tina's hair clip that identify Dickerson‚Äîa paroled convict. They track him down to the halfway home, although Connor secretly helps him to escape to a nearby scrapyard. In Dickerson's room, a hidden cache of souvenirs is found, along with a journal and a stack of letters marked \\"return to sender\\". Catherine Black identifies Dickerson as an archetypal \\"lost child\\", raised in poor foster care and neglected. He visits funerals to connect with society, leaving her to wonder what has pushed him to murder. Meanwhile, Dickerson remains in hiding at the scrapyard, while Connor brings him food. Frank Black has noticed that the \\"S\\" carved in Tina's stomach matches that seen in the logo for Skorpion Salvage, the scrapyard Dickerson is hiding in. When he and the police arrive to find Dickerson, Connor is able to escape while the yard's dogs attack Dickerson. Catherine Black has found Dickerson's biological mother, a Mrs. Dechant (Lynda Boyd). Having given Dickerson up for adoption as a teenager, she is now a suburban housewife. Dickerson had tried several years previously to reconnect with her, though she wanted nothing to do with him. Catherine asks her for help, and she begrudgingly agrees to see her son. She recoils when he hugs her, blaming the government for making him what he is. Rejected, Dickerson confesses to the murders. Connor is able to see all of this, his connection to it not yet uncovered. Frank Black is unconvinced that everything has been wrapped up, and realizes that Connor is involved‚Äîhe wants Dickerson to himself. \\"Stop looking\\" was his message to Dickerson, to stop looking for affection anywhere else. Mrs. Dechant returns home, and is about to take a bath when she is attacked by Connor. Black has followed her, and interrupts the attack; he and Connor struggle, with Black almost being strangled until he is able to hold Connor under the bathwater until he stops fighting. Connor is arrested and charged, while the now-cleared Dickerson resumes circling obituaries in the newspaper. Production \\"Blood Relatives\\" is the first of two episodes of Millennium to be directed by James Charleston, who would return later in the first season to helm \\"Wide Open\\". The episode also marks the first writing credit in the series for Chip Johannessen, who would go on to write an additional twelve episodes across all three seasons, including the series' final episode \\"Goodbye to All That\\". After Millennium cancellation, Johannessen would also contribute an episode to its sister show The X-Files, 1999's \\"Orison\\". \\"Blood Relatives\\" featured the second of three appearances by Brian Markinson as Seattle police detective Teeple; Markinson had previously played the character in \\"The Judge\\", and would reprise the role in \\"Sacrament\\". Guest star Deanna Milligan, who portrayed the second victim Tina, would also appear in the third season episode \\"The Sound of Snow\\" in an unrelated role. Bob Morrisey, who played the first victim's husband, also appeared in the third season, playing a sheriff in \\"Omert√†\\". The episode opens with a quotation from the Gospel of Luke, the third and longest of the four canonical Gospels of the Christian New Testament.Genge, p. 136 Biblical verses were also used at the beginning of other episodes in the series, including the Book of Job in \\"Wide Open\\"Genge, p. 137 and \\"Dead Letters\\";Genge, p. 133 the Book of Jeremiah in \\"Weeds\\";Genge, pp. 137‚Äì138 and the Book of Exodus in \\"Kingdom Come\\".Genge, p. 135 Reception \\"Blood Relatives\\" was first broadcast on the Fox Network on December 6, 1996;Shearman and Pearson, p. 109 and earned a Nielsen rating of 7.5, meaning that roughly of all television-equipped households were tuned in to the episode.Genge, p. xviii The episode was watched by approximately households. \\"Blood Relatives\\" received positive reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, comparing it favourably to \\"Irresistible\\", a second season episode of The X-Files. Shearman and Pearson lauded Johannessen's \\"subtle writing\\", especially in the handling of the James Dickerson character; they felt the episode was \\"a study of a sociopath\\" which \\"humanises\\" its villain.Shearman and Pearson, pp. 109‚Äì110 Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B, finding that its depiction of the character of James Dickerson added \\"some shades of gray\\" to the series' usual \\"black and white morality\\". Handlen also felt that while the scene in which a woman is killed by a lake shore was \\"shocking without being exploitative\\", and was carried out in such a manner that \\"we don't feel as though she's targeted because she's a woman\\"; however, the climactic scene in which Dickerson's mother is attacked while stripping for a bath was seen as \\"a reminder of the show's inability to separate its lofty goals from its willingness to take the cheapest shots\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated \\"Blood Relatives\\" 5 out of 5, describing it as being \\"as shocking as it is sentimental\\". Gibron compared the episode to \\"Best Boys\\", an episode of the English series Cracker, and praised its \\"atmospheric, moody tone\\".

It premiered on the Fox network on December 20, 1996. The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter, and directed by Ralph Hemecker. \\"The Well-Worn Lock\\" featured guest appearances by Paul Dooley and Lenore Zann. Clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher) aids a family as they come to terms with the incestuous abuse they have suffered for decades. However, the father who is responsible still commands respect and political connections in the area, making the case a difficult one. \\"The Well-Worn Lock\\" is the third of seven Millennium episodes written by Carter. Hemecker would return to direct an episode in each of the show's seasons. The episode opens with a quote from Robert Louis Stevenson, and features several actors who would reappear in unrelated roles in both Millennium and its sister series The X-Files. Plot In Madison Park, Seattle, a family are gathered around the television. The mother leaves to go to bed, and the atmosphere in the room grows tense. The older of two sisters, Connie Bangs (Michelle Joyner) takes her sister Sara‚Äîwho is clearly much younger than she is‚Äîto her bedroom and locks her in, warning her not to let her father inside. Connie runs out of the house, fighting off her father, and is later found wandering the streets confused. She is taken to clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), and admits that her father has been sexually abusing her for years. However, given the length of time the abuse has been going on, Connie is afraid no one will believe her. The assistant district attorney assigned to the case, Rhonda Preshutski (Christine Dunford) agrees, believing the case to be weak. Child Protective Services cannot remove Sara from the household until Connie undergoes a psychiatric evaluation, although Black and police lieutenant Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) investigate the Bangs home to check up on the girl. The father, Joe Bangs (Paul Dooley), chases them off as his wife watches detachedly. Bangs wields a degree of political clout in the community, and pressures the district attorney's office to drop the case. Preshutski is furious with Black over the matter, until it is discovered from Connie's medical exams that Sara is not her sister, but her daughter. Black is later woken in her office by her husband Frank (Lance Henriksen). She had fallen asleep there while trying to find a legal precedent to remove Sara from the Bangs home. Catherine visits Connie, who is staying with another sister, Ruthie (Lenore Zann). Ruthie also reveals that their father had abused her, until she was sectioned following mental breakdown. Black is worried that Connie might be persuaded by her mother to drop the case. Joe Bangs finds himself unable to have the case dropped, but Bletcher still feels that Black's pursuit of it may end up costing her her job. However, Black knows she is doing the right thing and is determined to continue. Her fears for Sara are confirmed when it is discovered she and the elder Bangs have gone missing. Frank, an offender profiler, deduces that Bangs' controlling personality would cause him to take his daughter somewhere he knows, and realizes that they will be in the family's holiday cabin in the woods. A police manhunt begins, and Bangs is arrested without Sara coming to harm. The case against Bangs is presented before a grand jury, and Black is afraid that Connie will be too afraid to testify. However, she manages to reveal the truth of her abuse to the court. Later, she is seen with the lock from her bedroom door‚Äîwhich had previously been used by her father to lock them both inside‚Äîwhich she throws into a river. Production \\"The Well-Worn Lock\\" was the first of three Millennium episodes directed by Ralph Hemecker. Hemecker would later helm the second season's \\"The Curse of Frank Black\\", and the third season episode \\"Exegesis\\". The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter. Beyond creating the concept for Millennium, Carter would write a total of six other episodes for the series in addition to \\"The Well-Worn Lock\\"‚Äîthree in the first season, and a further three in the third season. Several of the actors in this episode have made other appearances in Millennium or series related to it. Michelle Joyner, who played abuse victim Connie Bangs, would later appear on Millennium sister show The X-Files, starring in the seventh season episode \\"Chimera\\". Guest star J. Douglas Stewart, who portrays Larry Bangs, later appeared in the second season episode \\"Monster\\" in an unrelated role. Fellow guest Sheila Moore, who played Clea Bangs, had previously made two appearances on The X-Files, in the episodes \\"Deep Throat\\"Lowry, pp. 102‚Äì103 and \\"Excelsis Dei\\".Lowry, pp. 186‚Äì187 The episode opens with a quotation by Robert Louis Stevenson‚Äî\\"The cruelest lies are often told in silence\\".

Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, noting that it \\"turns the complex into something easy and obvious\\". Shearman and Pearson felt that the character of Sara Bangs was \\"treated as an object by the episode\\", and that Carter's script \\"takes a very real issue and trivialises it\\" by presenting such an \\"open and shut case\\". However, they noted that the episode was \\"very well acted\\", and was \\"clearly well intentioned\\".Shearman and Pearson, pp. 110‚Äì111 The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode a B+, noting that it \\"tries some interesting things with the Millennium template\\". VanDerWerff felt that several of the episode's scenes \\"are as horrifying as anything I've seen on TV\\", adding that \\"they accomplish much of this through the mere power of suggestion\\". However, she also noted that the character of Joe Bangs was too simplistic, claiming that he is \\"so damned blatant about what he does that it eventually stops being horrifying and becomes preposterous\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 2.5 out of 5, finding that its focus on legal issues and counselling \\"fragments the tone and atmosphere\\" built by previous episodes. However, Gibron felt that \\"Carter's script handles the horrifying subject very well\\".

the first season of the American crime- thriller television series Millennium. It premiered on the Fox network on January 24, 1997. The episode was written by Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Michael Pattinson. \\"Weeds\\" featured guest appearances by Ryan Cutrona, Josh Clark and Terry David Mulligan. Forensic profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), a member of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group, investigates a series of kidnappings in a gated community, finding that the real danger in the neighborhood comes from within its own walls. \\"Weeds\\" was Spotnitz's writing d√©but for the series, and saw the return of recurring guest star C. C. H. Pounder, whose appearance received some critical appreciation. The episode, which begins with a quote from the Book of Jeremiah, was met with a mixed reception, with reviews complimenting the interesting, but poorly executed plot. Plot In the gated community of Vista Verde, teenager Josh Comstock is riding his motorcycle, unaware that he is being followed by an unseen man driving a van. He is later stopped by the driver and pacified with a cattle prod. The following morning, Comstock's mother finds a corpse in his bed‚Äîbut it is not that of her son. Sheriff Paul Gerlach (Ryan Cutrona) seeks the aid of private investigative firm the Millennium Group, who dispatch offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and pathologist Cheryl Andrews (C. C. H. Pounder) to help the investigation. Gerlach reveals that the dead boy, Kirk Orlando, had gone missing previously, and feels that Comstock's kidnapping is his fault, as he did not alert the wider community about Orlando's disappearance. Orlando's father comes forward with a piece of evidence‚Äîhis mailbox had been stuffed with shredded banknotes. That evening, Black and Gerlach visit a town meeting organised by Edward Petey (Josh Clark), where another of the residents, Bob Birckenbuehl (Terry David Mulligan), accuses Gerlach of knowing more than he is letting on. Gerlach tells the assembly that the killer is from the community. Comstock's parents return home after the meeting to find the number 331 daubed on their son's bed in blood. The father, Tom Comstock (Michael Tomlinson) confides in Black that the number is that of the hotel room he had been using to carry on an extramarital affair, which Black persuades him to come clean about with his wife. Birckenbuehl's son Charlie is kidnapped from his bedroom, again subdued with a cattle prod. Andrews and Black discover that the boy's goldfish had been poisoned with whiskey, which they believe to be another message like Comstock's number. The town's swimming instructor, Adam Burke (Brian Taylor) is interviewed, as he had contact with both missing boys through his coaching. Black discovers that Burke's son had been killed in a hit-and-run accident; Black also receives post containing a paint swatch with the number 528 on it, but he is unsure of its meaning. Tom Comstock comes home the next day to find his son returned, alive but shaken. Black deduces that the paint swatch matches paint used on the vehicle that killed Burke's son; he also realizes that the boys are being kidnapped to force their fathers to confess hidden sins‚ÄîComstock's son was returned after he revealed his affair, while Orlando's son was killed because he kept secret a crime involving money. From there, Black sees that Charlie's kidnapping means that Birckenbeuhl is the hit-and- run driver. Black convinces Birckenbeuhl to confess publicly to the hit-and- run, in order to have his son returned. Birckenbeuhl does so, but continues to maintain his innocence in private. Charlie is not returned, however; instead, a cassette is sent to Birckenbuehl by the killer, who explains that since Birckenbeuhl took a life, one must be taken from him in return. Black is able to deduce from the background noise on the tape that Charlie is being held near the local high school's swimming pool. The boy is rescued, and killer‚ÄîEdward Petey‚Äîis found and arrested. However, the elder Birckenbeuhl is found hanged in his bedroom, driven to suicide by his guilt. Production \\"Weeds\\" is the first of fives episodes of Millennium to be written by Frank Spotnitz, who would go on to write \\"Sacrament\\" later in the first season, as well as penning \\"TEOTWAWKI\\", \\"Antipas\\" and \\"Seven and One\\" in the series' third season. Spotnitz was a prolific writer for Millennium sister show The X-Files, receiving his first writing credit for that series for the episode \\"End Game\\". \\"Weeds\\" also marks director Michael Pattinson's only work for the series. The episode features the second of five appearances by C. C. H. Pounder as Millennium Group pathologist Cheryl Andrews. Pounder had first appeared in the role in the earlier episode \\"The Judge\\",Genge, p. 34 and would go on to make another three appearances across all three seasons. Terry David Mulligan, who played Bob Birckenbuehl, would go on to appear in the third season episode \\"Collateral Damage\\", in an unrelated role; while Ryan Cutrona, who portrayed the town's sheriff Paul Gerlach, would later be cast in The X-Files ninth season opening episode, \\"Nothing Important Happened Today\\", which was written by Spotnitz and Millennium creator Chris Carter. \\"Weeds\\" opens with a quotation from the Book of Jeremiah, one of the Latter Prophets of the Hebrew Bible.Genge, pp. 137‚Äì138 Biblical verses were also used at the beginning of other episodes in the series, including the Gospel of Luke in \\"Blood Relatives\\";Genge, p. 136 the Book of Job in \\"Wide Open\\"Genge, p. 137 and \\"Dead Letters\\";Genge, p. 133 and the Book of Exodus in \\"Kingdom Come\\".Genge, p. 135 Broadcast and reception C.

Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five, describing it as \\"a portrait of a community in fear\\" that \\"simmers with recrimination and vigilantism\\". However, Shearman and Pearson felt that the individual characters lacked personality, as Spotnitz's script \\"spends a lot of time introducing figures as potential suspects rather than giving a great deal of depth to any of them\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated \\"Weeds\\" 3 out of 5, noting that \\"something about [the episode] just isn't right\\". Gibron felt that it was \\"one of the weaker episodes in the series, but it also had some of the greatest potential\\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B. Handlen felt that the \\"black-and- white morality\\" of \\"Weeds\\", and Millennium as a series, was a negative factor, adding \\"as always with Millennium, there's the feeling that the only life worth living is one entirely free from sin, and I can't say that I buy that\\". However, Handlen praised C. C. H. Pounder's guest role, finding that she \\"manages to put herself across quite well\\" despite the difficulty of standing out amidst the series' sombre tone.

Forensic profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), a member of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group, tracks a serial killer who hides in his victims' homes and preys on those who feel most safe. \\"Wide Open\\" was Charleston's second, and Holland's only, contribution to the series. The episode opens with a quote from the biblical Book of Job, and makes reference to author Patricia Highsmith. It received mixed reviews from critics. Plot A man, Cutter (Pablo Coffey), visits an open house viewing, where he is given a tour by the estate agent, and seems to take an interest in the bedroom of a young girl. That night, the owners have returned home, and are settling down for the evening when their daughter, Patricia, begins screaming. Later, a security guard for the family's alarm company finds the bodies of the parents hacked to death on the first floor, but Patricia is nowhere to be seen. The Millennium Group, a private investigative group, dispatches profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) to the scene, where he meets Seattle detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich). Black finds the house's alarm system, noticing that it did not go off until the killer left the house. He deduces that the killer stayed hidden in the house during the viewing, emerging that evening to kill the family. However, Black also notices something near an air vent; pulling it from the wall, he finds Patricia, alive but greatly disturbed. Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher), a clinical social worker, warns against questioning Patricia ‚Äî although she is an important witness, she is only a child and is in a fragile mental state. Black and Bletcher visit James Glen (Glynn Turman) a graphology expert, having found the killer's signature in the viewing's guestbook. Analysis of the killer's handwriting links him to almost forty open house viewings over the previous six months. An estate agent receives a video recording of the murders in the post, leaving Black puzzled. That same day, the killer hides in another open house, later murdering a woman with a shotgun before calling the police to the scene. Black finds an X drawn in blood under the house's welcome mat; Patricia has begun drawing red Xs in her crayon pictures, which Catherine takes notice of. Black reviews the videotape, finding a reflection of the killer in a glass pane. Extracting a picture from this, he requests to show it to Patricia, but stops himself, realizing that the killer let Patricia live so that she could relive the events when questioned. Cutter, a crossing guard, hides the shotgun in a dumpster, calling the police to report finding it. The police officer who takes his statement later recognizes him on seeing the video. Black has deduced the killer's motives‚Äîhe is trying to undermine society's notion of safety. Black and Bletcher organize a stakeout at another open house, identifying Cutter when he arrives; however, Cutter escapes into the neighborhood. Black realizes that he has hidden in a nearby house, where he and Bletcher find the occupants tied up. Cutter ambushes Black, knocking him down, but before Cutter can escape, the family's dog lunges at him, sending him falling over a mezzanine to his death. Bletcher later tells Black that Cutter's aunt and uncle were tortured to death in front of him when he was a child, which led him to recreate the torment for other families. Production \\"Wide Open\\" is the second of two episodes of Millennium to be directed by James Charleston, who had also helmed the earlier first season episode \\"Blood Relatives\\". The episode also marked the only contribution to the series from writer Charles D. Holland. Pablo Coffey, who portrayed Cutter, the episode's serial killer, would later appear in \\"Manus Domini\\", an episode of Millennium creator Chris Carter's series Harsh Realm.

Handlen felt that the treatment of the episode's villain was better than most other instalments of the series, which \\"helps give the episode overall a stronger sense of purpose\\". However, it was felt that the character of Frank Black was still too vague and impersonal, coming across simply as \\"a generic representation of Chris Carter's idea of heroism\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated \\"Wide Open\\" 3.5 out of 5. Gibron felt that the episode had \\"a clever premise, a great deal of suspense and some gruesomely graphic imagery\\", but criticized the \\"off-the-cuff\\" manner in which the killer's motives were explained.

It premiered on the Fox network on January 31, 1997. The episode was written by Ted Mann, and directed by David Nutter. \\"Loin Like a Hunting Flame\\" featured guest appearances by William Lucking, Hrothgar Mathews and Harriet Sansom Harris. Forensic profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), a member of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group, joins a fellow Group member to track a killer driven by sexual neuroses and who uses mood-altering drugs to gain control of his victims. \\"Loin Like a Hunting Flame\\" has received mostly negative reviews from critics, with its treatment of female characters being seen as particularly poor. The episode‚ÄîNutter's last contribution to the series‚Äîcontains several literary references, alluding to both Dylan Thomas and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Plot In Boulder, Colorado, a rave is underway in a nightclub. Pharmacist Art Nesbitt (Hrothgar Mathews) approaches a young couple, offering them drugs. Later, all three of them are in a room elsewhere, with Nesbitt recording the couple having sex. When they finish, he poisons them by injection. Their naked bodies are found the following day in a botanic garden, posed to resemble the story of Adam and Eve. The Millennium Group, a private investigative firm, despatches offender profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Maureen Murphy (Harriet Sansom Harris) to aid the police investigation. Detective Thomas (William Lucking) feels uncomfortable working with Murphy, believing that women do not understand male sex offenders. Elsewhere, Nesbitt is spying on a swingers' party, and follows two women as they leave to buy more alcohol for the party. He impersonates a police officer and pulls their car over. The next day the women are reported missing by their husbands, and their bodies are found posed in a park. Nesbitt is next seen working in his pharmacy, when another young couple come in to purchase medication in preparation for an exotic honeymoon. Nesbitt instead surreptitiously gives them an MDMA-like drug, suggesting they take it immediately. Meanwhile, the investigation has found traces of this drug in the other victims, with Black believing that the killer not only has access to it through his occupation but is likely consuming it himself while committing his crimes in order to readily act on his sexual fantasies. Black follows up on this, and investigates Nesbitt's pharmacy. Nesbitt is not working at the time, but Black realizes he must be the killer. He interviews Nesbitt's wife (Barbara Howard), finding that they have not had sex in eighteen years of marriage‚Äîhowever, Nesbitt has recently become interested in trying again. Later, Detective Thomas tells Black that he really has no problem with Murphy‚Äîhis true issue with the case is his own past. Having investigated sexual offences in the past, Thomas had found the cases affecting him personally, leaving him unable to have sex with his wife and leading to their divorce. Black realizes that the killer is trying to experience the sexual encounters he missed out on before his marriage, and that he believes his victims are living the happiest moments of their lives because of his actions. He returns to the Nesbitt home, finding the honeymooning couple locked in a bomb shelter below the house. Black runs upstairs, thinking that Nesbitt will murder his wife, but arrives in time to see him commit suicide by injection instead. Production \\"Loin Like a Hunting Flame\\" is the second of four episodes of Millennium to have been written by Ted Mann, who had previously written \\"The Judge\\", and would go on to write \\"Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions\\" and the first-season finale \\"Paper Dove\\". The episode was directed by David Nutter, and was his last directing credit for the series, having helmed \\"Pilot\\", \\"Gehenna\\" and \\"522666\\" earlier in the season. A member of Fox's Standards and Practices department was flown out to the episode's Vancouver, British Columbia filming location. She was asked to watch the episode being produced to ensure that it did not breach any of the network's censorship rules. Several of the scenes that were being produced required quite small spaces during filming, requiring Nutter to record additional coverage on a handheld camera, which he later played back to the Standards and Practices liaison for approval. The episode's title is taken from a line in the Dylan Thomas poem Ballad of the Long-legged Bait, which was first published in 1946's Deaths and Entrances; while the quotation displayed at the beginning‚Äî\\"Two souls, alas, are housed within my breast\\"‚Äîis taken from Goethe's Faust, a two-part 19th century play by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Both literary allusions serve to highlight the secret life of the character of Nesbitt‚Äîthe first in its subject matter, the second thematically echoing the character's two lives.Genge, pp. 138‚Äì139 Several of the cast had previously worked with series creator Chris Carter on his previous series The X-Files‚ÄîHarriet Sansom Harris had appeared in the first season episode \\"Eve\\"; Hrothgar Matthews had played roles in four episodes; and Tyler Labine, who briefly appeared handing out leaflets in the episode's cold open, had made appearances in two episodes of that series.Genge, pp. 127‚Äì128 Broadcast and reception \\"Loin Like a Hunting Flame\\" was first broadcast on the Fox Network on January 31, 1997;Shearman and Pearson, p. 113 and earned a Nielsen rating of 8, meaning that roughly of all television-equipped households were tuned in to the episode.Genge, p. xviii \\"Loin Like a Hunting Flame\\" received mostly negative reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five, finding Mann's writing to lack tension and imagination. Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode \\"has good moments, and is at least efficient and watchable\\", but believed that it \\"doesn't really deliver anything special, doesn't try to be anything other than average\\".Shearman and Pearson, pp. 113‚Äì114 Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated \\"Loin Like a Hunting Flame\\" 4 out of 5, describing it as being \\"handled in a subtle, somber manner\\". Gibron felt that \\"the events unfold in this episode evenly and eerily\\", and it serves as an example of \\"what could have been done had the show's focus, both literally and metaphysically, remained on crime\\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode an F, calling it \\"quite possibly one of the worst episodes of television I've ever seen\\". VanDerWerff felt that the episode's wariness of the 1990s rave subculture was particularly dated. She also felt that \\"Loin Like a Hunting Flame\\" served as a prominent example of Millennium \\"social conservatism\\", noting that it seems \\"fairly closed-off from other points-of-view\\" than that of the character Frank Black.

Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) investigates a pair of suicides connected to a cult which has been experimenting with human cloning. Black is dogged on his travels by a strange man interested in both the Millennium Group and doomsday predictions. \\"Force Majeure\\" features stock footage of the 1996 Saguenay Flood, and makes mention of a conjunction of planets which occurred in May 2000. The episode was viewed by approximately 6.9 million households during its original broadcast, and has received positive reviews from critics. Plot During a hailstorm in Washington state, university students run to find shelter. One girl, Lauren (Kristi Angus), stands in the rain, lights a cigarette, and goes up in flames. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview witnesses to the death. A teaching assistant tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an armillary sphere Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black that the previous Millennium Group contact had taken great interest in this sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in question‚ÄîDennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing how when several planets achieve syzygy on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters will bring about the end of the world. Hoffman believes that this cataclysm will be preceded by strange events and weather patterns. Black later contacts another Group member, Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn), who tells him that Hoffman had attempted to join the Group years earlier, and although he was refused admission, has continued to track the Group's activities harmlessly. Watts also finds that Lauren is not her parents' biological child, but cannot find any record of her adoption. Group coroner Cheryl Andrews (C. C. H. Pounder) finds traces of accelerant on the body, and rules the death a suicide. She also finds an astrological symbol representing conjunction carved in the girl's thigh. At a waterfall, another girl commits suicide by drowning. The girl, Carlin, looks identical to Lauren. Andrews performs an autopsy on Carlin as well, finding the same astrological symbol. It also becomes clear that the two girls are related‚Äîidentical twins, born seven years apart. The girls are clones, produced using a technique similar to that used to create identical cattle. Black believes that this is connected to Hoffman's Earth Changes theory, that someone is breeding offspring destined to survive May 5, 2000. Hoffman provides the Group with information leading them to Pocatello, Idaho, where a group of even more cloned girls is found living in a commune. The police fear that a cult- involved suicide may be being planned, and they take the girls into protective custody. The girls are taken onto a bus as Black speaks to their biological father, a preacher confined to a negative pressure ventilator (Morgan Woodward). The man reveals to Black that he attempted to create a caste of pure and innocent people who could repopulate society benevolently after the cataclysm. He contacted some of the girls to let them know he would die before the apocalyptic date, and they committed suicide shortly afterwards. That night, a power cut stops the man's ventilator, killing him. When Black leaves to meet with the girls in custody, he finds that the bus driver was another of the man in the ventilator's offspring, and has escaped with the clones; Hoffman has also disappeared. Black realizes that the building they found the girls in is located in an area of extreme geological stability, and is built on shock absorbing foundations‚ÄîBlack does not know where the cult has escaped to, but he does know where they will be on May 5, 2000.

When a spate of killings seems to echo that of a man currently incarcerated, Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) must confront the specter of his past and face a murderer who nearly took a younger Black's life. \\"The Thin White Line\\" draws inspiration from real killers Herbert Mullin, Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris, and contains several references to Morgan and Wong's previous series Space: Above and Beyond. The episode was viewed by approximately 6.6 million households in its initial broadcast and has received positive reviews from critics. Plot Anne Rothenburg answers a knock on her front door. When she speaks to the man waiting there, he hears something else entirely; believing that she is giving her consent to be murdered, he attacks her. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) visits a Seattle hospital to pick up his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher), who works there as a counsellor. Rothenburg is brought in on a stretcher by paramedics. Black notices a peculiar slash across her palm, and glances down at his own, which bears a scar matching the woman's cut exactly. Rothenburg then dies of her injuries. Black contacts Seattle Police Department detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) for information on Rothenburg. Her husband found her when he came home, assuming that she had surprised a burglar. Elsewhere, her attacker shoots the clerk in a liquor store, again hearing the victim give permission to be killed. Black and Bletcher review security camera footage of the crime, which leads to them discovering half a playing card‚Äîthe Jack of Spades‚Äîat the scene. Rothenburg's home is searched and the other half is found there. Black tells Bletcher about Richard Alan Hance (Jeremy Roberts), a serial killer Black had helped to apprehend twenty years before. Hance was a disturbed Vietnam War veteran who marked his kills with half a playing card, a custom he picked up during his tours of duty. Black was one of a number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who responded to an anonymous tip, leading them to Hance's location‚Äîhowever, the tip was called in by Hance himself and the raid became an ambush. Three agents were killed, and Black was cornered by Hance, who cut open his palm and nearly took Black's life before the young Black was able to overpower and arrest him. In the present, Black realizes that the current murderer must be Hance's former cellmate Jacob Tyler (Scott Heindl). Black visits Hance in prison, and upon speaking to Hance, realizes that Tyler believes himself Hance's reincarnation, aspiring to follow his methods exactly. Meanwhile, Tyler calls the police and leaves an anonymous tip, telling them that the liquor store murderer is hiding in an abandoned building. Black accompanies a SWAT team encircling the building, but the officers come under sniper fire from a construction site across the street. Black and Bletcher separate as they search for Tyler, who gets the drop on Black. Black disarms Tyler, attempting to talk him into surrendering. Tyler empties a handgun at Black, but misses; when Bletcher confronts him, Tyler points the gun and Bletcher instinctively shoots and kills him.

The relationship between the characters of Jacob Tyler and Richard Allen Hance seems to have been based on that of Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris, two convicts whose time in prison together formed the basis of a partnership that saw them torture and kill several young women in 1979.Genge, pp. 17‚Äì18 Tyler's delusional visions of his victims consenting to be murdered may stem from West German serial killer Waldemar Szczepinski, who chose his victims based on their response to him ringing their doorbells‚Äîthose who answered he deemed to have given their permission to be killed and their houses burgled; those who did not were simply left alone.Genge, p. 20 The character also draws inspiration from American serial killer Herbert Mullin, who likewise felt that his victims had offered him permission to kill them. Mullin claimed that their last words were often \\"I understand\\".Genge, pp. 20‚Äì21 Scott Heindl, who portrayed Jacob Tyler, would later return in an unrelated role in the second season episode \\"A Room with No View\\", and the third season episode \\"Antipas\\". The episode contains several references to Morgan and Wong's short-lived series Space: Above and Beyond, which had been cancelled prior to the pair joining Millennium. The phrase \\"expect no mercy\\" found on the playing cards is the motto of that series' United States Marine Corps squadron, while the individual cards used‚Äîthe Jack of Spades, King of Clubs and Queen of Hearts‚Äîmirror the call signs used by individual marines.Genge, pp. 21‚Äì22 Broadcast and reception \\"The Thin White Line\\" was first broadcast on the Fox Network on February 14, 1997.Shearman and Pearson, p. 115 The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 6.8 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented 6.6 million households, and left the episode the seventy-second most-viewed broadcast that week. The episode received positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode an A‚àí, finding that it showed the series to be \\"unafraid to be unapologetically weird\\". VanDerWerff felt that \\"The Thin White Line\\" introduced elements of mysticism and the supernatural to the character of Frank Black, which \\"presages the weirder direction Morgan and Wong took the show in season two, while still staying roughly consistent with the first season‚Äôs more realistic focus\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, comparing it to the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs. Gibron noted that \\"with a stellar final act and a closing scene that has a great deal of impact in a very restrained manner, this is an excellent installment \\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"The Thin White Line\\" five stars out of five, noting that \\"it's a return to the serial killer format, but it's never been done before with as much verve as it had here\\". Shearman compared the episode to both The Silence of the Lambs and the works of film director Quentin Tarantino, and felt that the interrogation scene between Black and Hance was \\"maybe the single best scene in the whole season\\".Shearman and Pearson, pp. 115‚Äì116 Cinematographer Robert McLachlan received an American Society of Cinematographers award nomination in the category Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in a Regular Series for his work on \\"The Thin White Line\\". McLachlan lost to Marc Reshovsky for the 3rd Rock from the Sun episode \\"Nightmare on Dick Street\\".

It premiered on the Fox network on February 21, 1997. The episode was written by Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Michael W. Watkins. \\"Sacrament\\" featured guest appearances by Philip Anglim, Dylan Haggerty and Brian Markinson. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) faces difficulty when his sister-in-law is abducted after her son's baptism. Meanwhile, Black's daughter Jordan begins to show signs of experiencing the same seemingly-psychic visions that have plagued him. Spotnitz's script for \\"Sacrament\\", which he has called his favourite of those written for Millennium, draws inspiration from real life serial killers John Wayne Gacy and Dennis Nilsen. The episode has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and was viewed by approximately 6.81 million households during its original broadcast. Plot Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) joins his brother Tom (Philip Anglim) and sister-in-law Helen (Liz Bryson) for their newborn son's christening. After the child is baptized, Black joins his daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady), finding her in hysterics. She claims to have seen a man hurting Helen; when Black and his brother rush outside, they find the baby in the back of Tom's car, but Helen is gone. Black's contact in the Seattle Police Department, Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), insists that Black should not get involved in the case as he is too close to the victims. However, Black insists he can be of assistance, and reviews security footage of a stranger investigating Tom's luggage after their flight. Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside. Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex offenders in the Seattle area‚ÄîBlack recognizes Richard Green (Dylan Haggerty) as the man from the airport footage. Tom later searches Black's office, stealing his gun and finding Green's name and address. Tom confronts Green at his home, demanding to know where his wife is. The police, who have been watching Green's house, intervene and take Tom home before anyone is harmed. Black apologizes for keeping information from Tom, but warns him that his outburst is exactly why he did so. Watts has meanwhile tracked forensic evidence from the abandoned car to a cabin in the woods; blood found there matches both Green and Helen, and a ring is discovered which is identified as Helen's wedding ring. Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan continues to ask about Helen's whereabouts, and her remarks about Helen's conditions lead Black to believe she is starting to experience the seemingly-psychic visions he is capable of seeing, which allow him to see the evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found‚Äîalthough another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house. Production Writer Frank Spotnitz has called \\"Sacrament\\" his favourite Millennium script. \\"Sacrament\\" was written by Frank Spotnitz and directed by Michael W. Watkins. Spotnitz had previously written \\"Weeds\\" earlier in the first season, as well as penning \\"TEOTWAWKI\\", \\"Antipas\\" and \\"Seven and One\\" in the series' third season. Spotnitz was a prolific writer for Millennium sister show The X-Files, receiving his first writing credit for that series for the episode \\"End Game\\". Spotnitz has described \\"Sacrament\\" as his favourite script for the series, finding the character of Richard Green to be \\"creepy\\" and believing that \\"the solution to the mystery [was] sufficiently unexpected\\". \\"Sacrament\\" is the only episode of Millennium to have been directed by Watkins. Watkins' work on the episode led to him becoming a director and executive producer for The X-Files when that series moved production to Los Angeles. The episode features the last appearance in the series by Brian Markinson as Seattle police officer Teeple; Markinson had previously portrayed the character in the earlier first season episodes \\"The Judge\\" and \\"Blood Relatives\\". The treatment of the two victims seen in \\"Sacrament\\"‚Äîthe immurement of Helen Black and the burial in the garden of the unidentified second victim‚Äîappear to have been based on the methods used by real life serial killers John Wayne Gacy, Dennis Nilsen and Dorothea Puente to dispose of their victims.Genge, pp. 27‚Äì28 Both Gacy and Nilsen habitually murdered men they had taken home as lovers, with Gacy storing bodies in the crawl space of his home,Sullivan and Maiken, p. 217 and Nilsen keeping corpses in wardrobes and under the floorboards.Wilson and Seaman, p. 39 Puente would kill her tenants for their money and bury their bodies in the gardens of the properties they were renting.Gibson, p. 112 Broadcast and reception \\"Sacrament\\" was first broadcast on the Fox Network on February 21, 1997.Shearman and Pearson, p. 116 The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 6.4 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately households, and left the episode the seventy-seventh most-viewed broadcast that week. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an A‚àí, noting that it \\"subvert[s] our expectations\\" when dealing with the fallibility of a protagonist. Handlen felt that the episode's plot was somewhat inevitable following the introduction of Black's family, but that it was handled well; he also felt positively about the episode's symbolism of the vulnerability of innocence. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 5 out of 5, calling it \\"Millennium at its best\\". Gibron felt that \\"Sacrament\\" was \\"a taut, well-executed thriller\\" whose events \\"unfold with logic and authenticity\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"Sacrament\\" three stars out of five. Shearman felt that the plot was \\"a bit humdrum\\", finding that some emotional development was simply treated as \\"padding\\"; however, he praised guest star Philip Anglim for his performance.

It premiered on the Fox network on March 21, 1997. The episode was written by Robert Moresco, and directed by Roderick J. Pridy. \\"Covenant\\" featured guest appearances by John Finn, Michael O'Neill and Sarah Koskoff. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to Utah to construct a profile on a convicted murderer (Finn) who is asking for the death sentence. Reconstructing the crime, Black begins to doubt the man's guilt. Elements of \\"Covenant\\" were inspired by real- life murderers Albert Fish, Susan Smith and Arthur Shawcross. The episode was viewed by approximately 6.7 million households in its original broadcast. It has received positive reviews, with Moresco's script praised for its subtlety. Plot Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to Provo, Utah to meet Calvin Smith (Michael O'Neill), the prosecutor in a local murder case; and Didi Higgens (Sarah Koskoff), a pathologist for the County Medical Examiner's office. Smith and Higgens have been involved in the trial of former sheriff William Garry (John Finn), who has been convicted of killing his three children and wife. Garry pleaded guilty to murders, and forensic evidence has linked him to a wood-carving chisel used to commit the murders. Black has been asked to construct an offender profile for Garry, to determine whether the man is sufficiently dangerous to society for a judge to issue a death penalty. Garry himself is asking to be executed. Black travels to Garry's home with a deputy, Kevin Reilly (Steve Bacic). Daubed in blood on the kitchen window are the numbers \\"1 28 15\\", which Reilly notes no one has been able to understand. Black also listens to a recording of Garry's confession, which details the murders meticulously. Black convinces Garry's attorney to allow him an interview, insisting he will be entirely impartial. Garry tells Black he had planned the murders for some time, motivated by hatred for his wife and monetary concerns. Black refutes this, pointing out that Garry had carved a wooden angel as a gift for his wife that same day, using the chisel that was the murder weapon. Smith, realizing that Black does not believe Garry to be guilty, dismisses him from the case. Black discovers that Garry had been having an affair, having previously believed that Mrs. Garry was the unfaithful one; he also realizes that Garry was unaware that his wife was pregnant. Black has Higgens help him in getting the bodies exhumed, allowing the two to see that Mrs. Garry's wounds were not defensive, but self- inflicted. Black also determines that the message written in blood was in fact \\"I 28 15\\"‚ÄîBook of Isaiah, chapter 28, verse 15; which is concerned with lies and falsehoods. Black pieces together the actual events of the night of the murders, realizing that Mrs. Garry killed her children before committing suicide; before she died she blamed Garry for her actions, causing him to seek atonement by admitting to the crimes. Reilly admits to having helped Garry rearrange the crime scene to incriminate himself; Black urges him to come forward with the real events to save his friend's life. Production Albert Fish's self-harm inspired Garry's desire for atonement. \\"Covenant\\" was written by Robert Moresco and directed by Roderick J. Pridy, and was the first contribution to the series by either of the two. Moresco would go on to write \\"Broken World\\" later in the first season, and also acted as a producer during the series' run. Pridy would return to helm the second season episode \\"The Mikado\\".

MacKay had previously portrayed the character in \\"Pilot\\",Genge (Volume One), p. 2 \\"Gehenna\\"Genge (Volume One), p. 12 and \\"Weeds\\".Genge (Volume One), p. 102 The premise of a repentant murderer seeking to atone for their actions appears to have been based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his perineum and force rose stems along his urethra to be forcibly pulled out.Genge (Volume Two), pp. 50‚Äì51 However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case of Susan Smith, a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake.Genge (Volume Two), pp. 52‚Äì53 Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.Genge (Volume Two), pp. 51‚Äì52 Broadcast and reception \\"Covenant\\" was first broadcast on the Fox Network on March 21, 1997.Shearman and Pearson, p. 117 The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 6.9 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode.

Club Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode a B+, praising Moresco's script for its subtlety. VanDerWerff noted the premise's similarity to the Susan Smith case, and felt that the episode \\"actually gains strength from a certain distance from when it originally aired. Back then, it was just another ripped-from-the-headlines tale of a murderous mother. Now, it‚Äôs a crafty mystery that doesn‚Äôt reveal its cards until late\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4 out of 5, noting that the episode \\"broke clich√©s and trampled all over formulas\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"Covenant\\" four-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it \\"Millennium's version of Twelve Angry Men\\".

It premiered on the Fox network on March 28, 1997. The episode was written by Chip Johannessen and Tim Tankosic, and directed by Cliff Bole. \\"Walkabout\\" featured guest appearances by ≈Ωeljko Ivanek and Gregory Itzin. Forensic profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), a member of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group, finds himself suffering from amnesia after taking part in a nightmarish drug trial. Fearing that someone may have died as a result, Black attempts to track down the doctor responsible. \\"Walkabout\\" was the only episode of the series to feature contributions from either Bole or Tankosic. The episode, which opens with a quotation from Cicero, was viewed by approximately 6.1 million households in its initial broadcast, and earned mixed to positive reviews from critics. Plot In a medical clinic, a nurse escapes to the shops from a room, locking it just before someone inside can rape her. Inside the room, a group of people are screaming, panicking and self-mutilating; one man‚ÄîFrank Black (Lance Henriksen)‚Äîbegins pounding on a reinforced glass window until his fists bleed. Millennium Group investigator Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) visits Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher) to tell her that Frank, her husband and a fellow Group member, disappeared on his way to Yakima, Washington. Watts combs Black's computer history for information, finding emails back and forth between Black‚Äîusing the pseudonym \\"David Marx\\"‚Äîand a doctor called Daniel Miller. Catherine reveals that the pseudonym Black has been using is one he had also used to check into hotels during a previous mental breakdown. Black is discovered at a bus depot by a police, his hands injured and bandaged. His pseudonym is found on a hospital bracelet; and he has no recollection of events save for the suspicion that someone died during the gap in his memory. Watts helps Black trace Dr. Miller (≈Ωeljko Ivanek) to a hotel, where he informs them that Black was seeking a cure for his \\"gift\\"; a seemingly-psychic ability to understand others' psyches. Miller had been helping Black join a clinical trial for a drug called Proloft which would treat temporal lobe abnormalities; however, Black refutes that he would be interested in such a thing. Visiting a clinic, Black's ability reveals to him that he has been there before, during the nightmarish drug trial he cannot remember. From there, he is able to use the Millennium Group to persuade the drug company to release records which allow him to trace other participants. He finds that one participant died after gouging his own eyes out; the body of the supervising nurse is later found in a dumpster. Research on the drug given to the trial participants reveals it to be a chiral chemical, with two enantiomer forms; one is the harmless and beneficial Proloft, the other is the dangerous hallucinogen which Black and the others ingested. Dr Miller tells Black that he had been working on drugs to cure his own visions, which he believes are similar to Black's. One night, years earlier, Miller's left him after he ran into the road amidst oncoming traffic, almost killing himself in a hallucinatory state. After Black leaves, Hans Ingram (Gregory Itzin), the doctor responsible for the trial, breaks into Miller's room. Later, Miller is killed in a traffic accident after once again running onto a busy highway; Black finds a photograph of Ingram on his body. Watts and the police investigate Ingram's home, finding the eyeless body of the dead trial participant and sachets of something called \\"Smooth Time\\", which they ascertain to be the nightmarish enantiomer of Proloft. Watts and the Millennium Group receive news that workers at a city office building are rioting and panicking. Black realizes that Ingram had been distributing \\"Smooth Time\\" under the guise of a sweetener in order to drug a large number of people. Tracking Ingram to the office building's surveillance room, Black learns that the doctor believes that the country's dependence on antidepressants has created a nation of \\"zombies\\", and he is attempting to \\"wake them up\\" with violent hallucinogens. The doctor is arrested and taken into custody. At home with his family, Black's motives for visiting the drug trials return to him‚Äîhe is concerned about his young daughter Jordan, believing that she has inherited his abilities. He is now dissuaded from using pharmaceuticals to suppress this, opting instead to guide her to understand her gift. Production \\"Walkabout\\" opens with a quote from orator Cicero. \\"Walkabout\\" is the third Millennium episode penned by Chip Johannessen, after \\"Blood Relatives\\" and \\"Force Majeure\\". Johannessen would go on to write an additional ten episodes across all three seasons, including the series' final episode \\"Goodbye to All That\\". After Millennium cancellation, Johannessen would also contribute an episode to its sister show The X-Files, 1999's \\"Orison\\". Co-writer Tim Tankosic's contribution to this episode was his only involvement in Millennium. The episode also marked the only contribution to the series by director Cliff Bole. Bole also contributed episodes to The X-Files and Millennium creator Chris Carter's series Harsh Realm. Guest star ≈Ωeljko Ivanek had also previously appeared in \\"Roland\\", an episode of The X-Files.Genge, p. 45 Lance Henriksen was concerned that it would be out of character for Frank Black to recklessly take untested drugs, and suggested adding a line of dialogue‚Äî\\"I don't even take aspirin\\"‚Äîto the script to help clue the audience in to the fact that his involvement in the clinical trial was an attempt to aid his daughter.Genge, p. 46 The episode begins with a quotation translated from classical Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero's treatise De finibus bonorum et malorum‚Äî\\"I remember the very things I do not wish to; I cannot forget the things I wish to forget\\".

Shearman and Pearson found \\"Walkabout\\" the better episode of the two, but felt that it became \\"a curiously passionate affair\\" after the first act‚Äîfrom the cold open until Black is found by the police. Shearman also noted that ≈Ωeljko Ivanek's guest performance \\"lacked subtlety\\", though praised Henriksen for a \\"bravura performance.Shearman and Pearson, pp. 117‚Äì118 Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated \\"Walkabout\\" 4 out of 5, describing it as \\"a fine outing\\".

Wright. \\"Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions\\" featured guest appearances by Sarah- Jane Redmond and Richard Cox. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is convinced to return to work after the death of a close friend. However, it soon becomes apparent that his first case back on the job is much deeper than he had expected. \\"Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions\\" features the final appearances in the series by both Bill Smitrovich and Robin Gammell. The episode has received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and was viewed by approximately 6.5 million households in its initial broadcast. Plot Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) runs out to a supermarket parking lot where he witnesses a lawyer, Alistair Pepper (Richard Cox), being confronted by a man named Sammael (Rodney Eastman). Sammael raises his hand, and a bolt of lightning arcs from his fingers to strike Pepper dead; however, when Black reaches Sammael, he finds a pistol at the killer's feet. A few days before fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigates a murder in a suburban home, in which occult paraphernalia has been laid out in a disorganized manner. Watts contacts Black for help with the case. However, Black is still recovering from the murder of his friend Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), who was murdered in Black's home. Watts hangs up when he sees Sammael looking through the house's window, but by the time he can investigate, Sammael is gone. Watts later shows Black a picture taken at the murder scene, with Sammael recognizable among a crowd of people. Elsewhere, a man named Martin (Guy Fauchon) is arrested after slitting a babysitter's throat at a public park; despite the seemingly random nature of the crime, Black believes that the man may be connected to Bletcher's murder. However, he soon starts to suspect that Martin may be innocent of the crime he has been arrested for. Black also has a dream in which a mutilated Bletcher tries and fails to speak to him, which leads Black to believe he has lost his ability to see into the minds of others. The case against Martin falters as evidence disappears and witnesses fail to identify him in a line-up. Black is approached by Pepper, Martin's self-appointed lawyer, who extends Black an invitation to join his legal practice. Martin later claims in court to have killed Bletcher. Elsewhere, another Millennium Group member, Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell), receives a telephone call from someone pretending to be Black. Meanwhile, Black suspects that the occult-oriented murder may have been committed to draw the Group, and Black, into the open again. In his jail cell, Martin cuts his own throat with a concealed razor blade; however, a coroner later finds that his death was caused by an aneurysm. Black believes that Pepper is somehow involved. Watts and Black find Atkins murdered in a hotel room, and chase a suspect down a fire escape and into a supermarket. Inside, Black finds Pepper, but as Pepper moves in and out of view, his appearance seems to change to that of Martin, and then of Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), the woman Black suspects to have killed Bletcher. Pepper leaves the supermarket and approaches his car, where he is confronted and killed by Sammael. As Black apprehends Sammael, he is told that Pepper was killed as a \\"consequence of his own error\\"; Black takes it to mean that there is a larger mystery to which his own involvement is only tangential.

The Thrones are the third-highest ranking choir, belonging to the group charged with attending to God, and are described as stern incarnations of holy justice. Dominions, the fourth-highest choir, belong to the group appointed to deal with God's creations. Dominions lead the lower orders and impart wisdom to humanity.Genge (Volume Two), p. 74 Powers belong to the same tier as Dominions, and are tasked with countering the threat of temptation by the devil and demons.Genge (Volume Two), pp. 74‚Äì75 Principalities are the seventh-highest ranking choir and belong to the lowest grouping of angels, those most likely to appear to mankind.

It premiered on the Fox network on May 2, 1997. The episode was written by Robert Moresco and Patrick Harbinson, and directed by Winrich Kolbe. \\"Broken World\\" featured guest appearances by Ingrid Kavelaars, Donnelly Rhodes and Jo Anderson. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to North Dakota to track down a burgeoning serial killer who has progressed from mauling horses to attacking and killing people. \\"Broken World\\" featured the last directorial effort for the series by Kolbe, and the last script written by Moresco; however, Harbinson would return to write further episodes in later seasons. The episode has been compared to Peter Shaffer's 1973 play Equus, and received a Genesis Award from the Humane Society of the United States in 1998. Plot In Bowman, North Dakota, a stable-hand named Sally Dumont (Ingrid Kavelaars) is attacked and left unconscious after she finds a horse has been murdered in its stall. Private investigation organization the Millennium Group send offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) to investigate, as twenty-one horses have been killed in the same manner over the past two years in the area. Black believes the culprit is in the early stages of developing into a sexually motivated serial killer. Investigating the stables, the word \\"help\\" is found written in human blood, while semen is found near where the horse was killed. Black concludes the killer is struggling with the new feelings of having attacked a person and not an animal. The killer‚ÄîWilli Borgsen (Van Quattro)‚Äîis next seen attacking pigs in a trailer using a cattle prod. Borgsen is accosted by the pigs' owner, and responds by turning the cattle prod on him. The victim's body is later found in a nearby thicket. Black examines the scene, determining from the bootprints and evidence of the cattle prod being used that the killer works in a slaughterhouse. Another human victim is later found on a farm, alongside another dead horse. The phrase \\"thank you\\" is daubed on a nearby wall. The North Dakota police set up an anonymous phone number to appeal for information, which Borgsen uses to taunt Black by describing the pleasure he derives from killing. Black consults with a veterinarian, Claudia Vaughan (Jo Anderson), about the case, and learns that the area is home to a Premarin farm‚Äîestrogen for pharmaceutical use is derived from the urine of mares which are kept pregnant, their foals killed for meat to be exported. Black feels the killer may have been raised on one of these farms. Borgsen contacts Black again, confessing that his latest killing has not satisfied him. Black warns that his urges will only grow, and will never be satisfied again. When Borgsen hangs up, Black deduces that Vaughan is to be the next victim. Black, fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) and Sheriff Falkner (John Dennis Johnston) track the kidnapped Vaughan to an equine slaughterhouse. Falkner is attacked and incapacitated by Borgsen as Black locates a still-living Vaughan, who has been hung by her jacket from a meat hook. Black is then confronted by Borgsen, who knocks him down with the cattle prod. Borgsen is about to kill Black with a captive bolt pistol, but is trampled to death by several escaped horses. Production \\"Broken World\\" has been compared to the play Equus (1979 production pictured). \\"Broken World\\" was written by Robert Moresco and Patrick Harbinson. Moresco had previously written \\"Covenant\\" earlier in the first season, and also acted as a producer during the series' run. Harbinson, making his first contribution to the series with this episode, would later pen a further four episodes in the third season‚Äî\\"Via Dolorosa\\", \\"Darwin's Eye\\", \\"The Sound of Snow\\" and \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\". \\"Broken World\\" also marked the final episode of Millennium helmed by director Winrich Kolbe, who had previously worked on \\"Lamentation\\", \\"Force Majeure\\" and \\"Kingdom Come\\". During production, \\"Broken World\\" was instead set to be titled \\"Equus\\",Genge, p. 96 which is Latin for \\"horse\\" and was also the title of a 1973 play by Peter Shaffer concerning a young man with violent sexual urges towards horses.

VanDerWerff described the episode as \\"a bland, boring mess that ends with one of the most ridiculous deux ex machinas I‚Äôve seen in ages\\", and felt that \\"the guest cast is uniformly poor\\", singling out Van Quattro as being \\"laughably bad\\".

It premiered on the Fox network on May 9, 1997. The episode was written by Chip Johannessen, and directed by Peter Markle. \\"Maranatha\\" featured guest appearances by Bill Nunn, Boris Krutonog and Levani Outchaneichvili. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) aids both the New York Police Department and a Russian investigator to track down the mysterious \\"Yaponchik\\", a criminal from the Russian underworld who may be an incarnation of the biblical beast from the sea. \\"Maranatha\\", a title which translates from Aramaic as \\"our lord has come\\", connects the 1986 Chernobyl disaster to biblical prophecies of the star of Wormwood. The episode features the first of two directorial contributions from Markle, and sees future guest star Brian Downey appear in a minor role. Plot In New York City, a man named Yaponchik (Levani Outchaneichvili) shoots a man in the face, preventing the victim's identification; this is the third such murder committed this way. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is asked to aid the New York Police Department investigate the case. Black is joined by a Muscovite investigator, Yuri Surov (Boris Krutonog), and an undercover agent, Andrei Melnikov (Dmitri Boudrine). Examining the victim's body, a symbol is found on the corpse resembling an inverted V, but its meaning is unknown. Black, Melnikov and Surov visit a Russian nightclub where the latter two are working undercover. As Surov and Black talk at one table, Melnikov is approached by Yaponchik. Someone in the club recognizes Yaponchik, and the crowd stampede out of the building when they hear his name. After the crowd has dispersed, Black and Surova find Melnikov's body at a table, his face shot off. Surova explains to Black that Yaponchik has come to be regarded by Russians as a sort of evil folkloric figure. Meanwhile, Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) determines that the \\"V\\"-like symbol found earlier is actually a fragment of the Chi Rho, a Christian symbol. Watts also informs Black that many Russians believe Yaponchik to have directly responsible for the Chernobyl disaster, a Soviet nuclear meltdown tied by some to Biblical prophecies of the apocalypse. Black researches the disaster, finding a picture of both Medikov and Surova at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and realizes that both men have been tracking Yaponchik for revenge. One of Yaponchik's victims is identified as a restorer of Russian icons. Her home is searched, and it is found that she had uncovered Yaponchik's identity and attempted to appease him by sending him several icons. Black feels Yaponchik is killing in order to perpetuate the legends surrounding him by instilling fear in those who believe them. Watts and Black visit the Russian Embassy to find the man the icons were being mailed to‚ÄîSergei Stepanovich, identifiable as Yaponchik. Stepanovich is protected by diplomatic immunity; however, it becomes clear that Surova, Medikov and an Orthodox priest who aided the investigation have all been stalking Stepanovich, who they believe to be the Antichrist. Yaponchik murders another two men at a bathhouse, but is confronted by Surova. Yaponchik tells Surova he cannot be killed. Surova ignores this, and shoots him in the head. Yaponchik is then found and rushed to hospital. Black sees the crime scene at the bathhouse, and draws a connection between Yaponchik and the beast from the sea in the Biblical Book of Revelation, who is said to survive a fatal head wound; fearing that Yaponchik will likewise survive, Black heads to the hospital. Surova beats him there, however, and confronts the recovered Yaponchik. As Surova is about to shoot his quarry again, he is convinced instead that Yaponchik is \\"not the one\\" he is thought to be. Surova helps Yaponchik make his way to the helipad on the hospital's roof. Black and Watts arrive on the roof in time to see Yaponchik escorted onto a helicopter by several men, who take off before they can be apprehended. Production \\"Maranatha\\" was directed by Peter Markle, making his first contribution to the series. Markle would later return to helm the third season episode \\"Seven and One\\". The episode was written by Chip Johannessen, who went on to write a total of twelve episodes across all three seasons, including the series' final episode \\"Goodbye to All That\\". After Millennium cancellation, Johannessen would also contribute an episode to its sister show The X-Files, 1999's \\"Orison\\". Johannessen would also become one of the series' executive producers during its third season, alongside Ken Horton. The episode's title, \\"Maranatha\\", is an Aramaic language word translated as \\"our lord has come\\" or \\"come, our lord\\"; the word is found in the biblical First Epistle to the CorinthiansGenge, p. 107 and is believed to have been used as a greeting among early Christians.Ice and Demy, p. 127 During production, the episode used the working title \\"The Second Coming\\". The character Peter Watts makes mention of the origin of the name of Chernobyl, a city in Ukraine that was the location of the Chernobyl disaster, a 1986 nuclear meltdown. According to Watts, the name \\"Chernobyl\\" translates as \\"wormwood\\", causing the disaster to be likened to the Biblical star of Wormwood prophesied in the Book of Revelation, which was said to cause death through poisoning the waters. However, the word \\"chernobyl\\" can be translated as \\"black grass\\" or \\"black myth\\".Landes, pp. 129‚Äì134 Actor Brian Downey, who portrayed a medical examiner in the episode, later appeared in an unrelated role in the two-part second season episodes \\"Owls\\" and \\"Roosters\\".

Club Zack Handlen rated the episode a B+, describing it as \\"a ho-hum X-Files knock-off\\". Handlen felt that the acting was strong, and that the references to both Chernobyl and apocalyptic prophecies formed a good basis for the episode; however, he noted that the script's uncertainty as to whether its villain really was the Antichrist caused it to lose impact. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, praising its \\" incredibly tight script\\" and describing it as \\"one of the best examples of Millennium careful balancing act between reality and the otherworldly\\". However, Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, finding that its plot \\"gets lost in the mix\\" amidst the details and atmosphere of the setting. Shearman compared the folkloric feel of Yaponchik as a Russian incarnation of the devil to the American view of the devil as an invasion of the family unit, as personified by the character Lucy Butler in \\"Lamentation\\", finding the two symbols to work well in contrast to each other.

Wright. \\"Paper Dove\\" featured guest appearances by Barbara Williams and Mike Starr. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) takes his family for holiday in Virginia, not realizing that he has been followed by an old stalker who is manipulating a local serial killer to lure Black into action. \\"Paper Dove\\" is a two-part episode, with the story continuing in the second season opening episode \\"The Beginning and the End\\". \\"Paper Dove\\" features the first appearances of Maxine Miller and Ken Pogue, who would become minor recurring guests in the series' third season; it also marks the first on-screen appearance of the \\"Polaroid Man\\", credited as \\"The Figure\\", who had been an unseen presence since \\"Pilot\\". The episode's central antagonist is based on a composite of several real life murderers, including Edmund Kemper and Jeffrey Dahmer. Plot Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels with his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) to visit Catherine's parents in Arlington County, Virginia. Also present are Catherine's sister Dawn (Barbara Williams) and her husband Gil. In Maryland, Henry Dion (Mike Starr) follows a woman home and murders her; he is later visited by a strange man hiding his face behind dark glasses‚Äîit becomes apparent that this is the man who has been sending Black threatening polaroid pictures. Dion thanks the man (Paul Raskin) for finding the victim for him, but is chided for not committing the murder while Black was in the area. Dion takes the corpse into the woods to bury it, all the while speaking to it as though in conversation. Catherine's father, Tom Miller (Ken Pogue), tells Black about two friends of his whose son was convicted of killing his wife. The father, C. R. Hunziger, is dying of pancreatic cancer, but maintains his distance from his son over the crime; his wife Adele, however, still believes her son to be innocent. Black visits the terminal Hunziger, hoping to change his mind, but the elderly man holds his position. Adele gives Black a folder full of documents relating to the case, which Black reviews. His knowledge of offender profiling leads him to believe that the convicted man, Malcom, is innocent; however the conviction was secured with a substantial level of physical evidence. Black also learns of the murder in Maryland, and connects it to the killings of four other women in the locale. Ignoring the protestations of his wife, Black leaves to investigate the parkland where one of the earlier bodies was uncovered. A park ranger discusses that case with him, telling Black that the body was found by an unidentified rambler. Black believes this man was the murderer. Elsewhere, Dion returns home, where he is belittled and emasculated by his overbearing mother, Marie (Linda Sorensen). Black and several former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving a press release describing him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police to rebut this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding him sitting, covered in blood, on the kitchen floor beside his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter from the airport to their car, while Catherine waits to collect their luggage. The man who had helped Dion stands to one side, watching the family. As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother. Production Dion's murder of his mother echoes Edmund Kemper's final murder; both killed their mothers and cut out their vocal cords. \\"Paper Dove\\" was written by Ted Mann and Walon Green, and directed by Thomas J. Wright. Wright had previously directed four episodes of the first season‚Äî\\"Dead Letters\\", \\"The Wild and the Innocent\\", \\"The Thin White Line\\" and \\"Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions\\"‚Äîand would go on to direct a further twenty-one episodes over the series' run. Wright would also go on to direct \\"Millennium\\", the series' crossover episode with its sister show The X-Files. \\"Paper Dove\\" was Mann's last script for the series, having penned three others earlier in the season; the episode was also the only one to have been written by Green. The character of Henry Dion appears to be a composite of several real life serial killers. His fondness for conversing with his victims' bodies and the gregarious demeanour shown during this seems to be based on Milwaukee- based murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who would also, like Dion, document his victims photographically.Genge, p. 112 The habit of photographing victims, and the notion of killing women to use them as props, stems from killer Henri Nadeau, who murdered several women in order to use them as mannequins for his photography.Genge, pp. 115‚Äì116 The use of an overbearing matriarchal figure as a stressor harkens to Edmund Kemper, who was driven to kill young women by his hatred of his mother, who he eventually murdered before turning himself in; both Dion and Kemper cut their mother's vocal folds from their throats after killing them.Pizzato, p. 316Douglas, p. 153 Maxine Miller and Ken Pogue both make their first appearances as Catherine Black's parents Justine and Tom Miller in this episode; the pair would later reprise their respective roles in several episodes of the third season, including \\"The Innocents\\", \\"Exegesis\\", and \\"Seven and One\\". The character played by Paul Raskin, credited here as \\"The Figure\\", would return in the second season opening episode \\"The Beginning and the End\\", which continues the storyline from \\"Paper Dove\\", although the character would by then be credited as \\"Polaroid Man\\", played instead by Doug Hutchison.

Broadcast and reception \\"Paper Dove\\" was first broadcast on the Fox Network on May 16, 1997.Shearman and Pearson, p. 122 The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 6.6 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode.

VanDerWerff felt that \\"Paper Dove\\" represented \\"the deepest the show has pulled us into a killer‚Äôs subconscious\\", making it \\"one of the most bone-chilling episodes Millennium has come up with so far\\". VanDerWerff compared elements of the episode, most notably the relationship between the character of Henry Dion and his mother, to the works of filmmaker David Lynch, particularly his television series Twin Peaks. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting that it \\"caps off the series sensationally\\".

Guest star Hutchison was a frequent collaborator with the writers, having worked together in several other series. The episode was seen by approximately 7.15 million households in its original broadcast, and has received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Plot The episode begins in media res from the ending of the preceding episode, \\"Paper Dove\\", showing Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) returning by plane to Seattle with his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady). As Black takes Jordan to their car, Catherine is drugged and kidnapped by a strange man (Doug Hutchison). The abductor‚Äîthe Polaroid Man‚Äîhides Catherine in his car and escapes with her to the mountains overlooking the city. Black's fellow Group members arrive to help, though he had not yet contacted any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's body had been found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if he could find the killer‚Äîyears later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize you must sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents‚ÄîBlack comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a dark room. Black struggles to find anything useful while investigating the abduction. However, he begins to experience seemingly- psychic visions which lead him to believe she is being held in their former home. The police raid the address but find it empty; Black finds a polaroid of another house inside. He is able to track down the address of this house, but goes alone this time. Reaching it, he finds Catherine in the basement, bound to a rafter. He goes to untie her but is blinded by a camera flash. He struggles with the Polaroid Man, which we see through a series of photographs taken by the man's camera. Black is able to wrest the Polaroid Man's knife away from him and stab him to death. Returning home, Catherine packs a suitcase for Black, telling him that she cannot have him in their home for the time being, believing that he sacrificed a part of himself in killing her attacker. She hopes that time apart might help him recover what he is missing inside; he takes the case and drives off. Production Life During Wartime\\" by Talking Heads (pictured 1978). \\"The Beginning and the End\\" was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed by Thomas J. Wright. Wright had previously directed five episodes of the first season‚Äî\\"Dead Letters\\", \\"The Wild and the Innocent\\", \\"The Thin White Line\\", \\"Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions\\" and \\"Paper Dove\\"‚Äîand would go on to direct a further twenty episodes over the series' run. Wright would also go on to direct \\"Millennium\\", the series' crossover episode with its sister show The X-Files. The episode was the fourth to have been written by Morgan and Wong, after \\"Dead Letters\\", \\"522666\\" and \\"The Thin White Line\\" in the first season. The duo would go on to pen a further eleven episodes over the course of the second season, having taken the roles of co-executive producers for the season. Doug Hutchison's character, credited here as \\"Polaroid Man\\", had previously appeared in the first season finale \\"Paper Dove\\". In that episode the character was credited as \\"The Figure\\", and been portrayed by Paul Raskin. The character had been a presence in the series since \\"Pilot\\", but had often merely been alluded to without being seen. Hutchison had worked with Morgan and Wong several times before; they had first met during production of \\"Squeeze\\", an episode of Millennium sister show The X-Files, and again on Morgan and Wong's short-lived series Space: Above and Beyond. Discussing plans for the season, Morgan noted that \\"the Millennium Group is a much deeper organization\\" than seen in the first season, adding that \\"they're considering [Frank Black] for a candidate for the group (and) trying to show him that at the millennium there's going to be an event - either fire and brimstone or harmonic convergence\\". Wong spoke about how the character of Catherine Black, saying \\"there's a different relationship between Frank and his family this season because of the separation ... I think that will not only bring some kind of heartfelt drama but humor into it\\". The episode makes use of the Talking Heads song \\"Life During Wartime\\", taken from their 1979 album Fear of Music. Broadcast and reception \\"The Beginning and the End\\" was first broadcast on the Fox network on September 19, 1997. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 7.3 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately households, and left the episode the fifty-third most-viewed broadcast that week. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Writing for The Buffalo News, Alan Pergament rated the episode three stars out of five, describing it as \\"moody\\" but \\"muddled and confusing\\". Pergament noted that \\"the suspense of the premiere actually is enhanced by all the summer speculation about the future role of Gallagher\\", and felt that Morgan and Wong were \\"trying to bring \\"Millennium\\" into \\"X-File\\" territory\\". The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode a A‚àí, finding that it allows the series to \\"[turn] a corner, from a serial killer show with stained-glass window overtones, to a show that revels in those overtones, a show that plays in age-old symbols with a decided taste of the weird\\". VanDerWerff also felt that a monologue delivered by O'Quinn was an example of Morgan and Wong's best writing, and that the actor's delivery was the key to keeping the scene serious in tone. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting that it \\"starts Season 2 off in high style\\". Gibron found that the episode \\"has a nice sense of internal adventure to it, giving us a chance to learn more about our main players while setting the groundwork for some certified surreality to come\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"The Beginning and the End\\" two-and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman felt that the episode had \\"an overwritten quality\\", citing the Polaroid Man's dialogue as the main example of this; he also believed that the development of Catherine Black as a character seemed poorly executed, with the character lacking enough depth to \\"retain the audience's sympathies\\".

It premiered on the Fox network on September 26, 1997. The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed by Allen Coulter. \\"Beware of the Dog\\" featured guest appearances by Randy Stone and R. G. Armstrong. Millennium centers on offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who investigates unusual crimes as part of the private investigative organisation the Millennium Group. In this episode, when Black investigates several killings by a pack of savage dogs, he discovers a strange old man who teaches him more than he ever knew about the Group. Guest star Armstrong would reprise his role later in the season, while Stone was the casting director for both Millennium and its sister show The X-Files. \\"Beware of the Dog\\" received mixed reviews from television critics, and was viewed by approximately 6.37 million households during its original broadcast. Plot A couple in a camper van get lost along a country road. They stop near a small town to read their map, but a pack of dogs break into their van, mauling them to death. Meanwhile, Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tries to convince fellow Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) to investigate the case. Black is experiencing a separation from his wife and daughter after killing his wife's kidnapper; he initially refuses the case but Watts' insistence sways him. Black arrives in the isolated town of Bucksnort, and visits a local diner. Standing out amongst the residents is Michael Beebe (Randy Stone), who has moved there from Los Angeles. Beebe believes his elderly neighbour may be responsible for the attack and asks Black to investigate. Black instead examines the crime scene. At sunset, he sees a group of five dogs beginning to follow him. He returns to his hotel, but when he discovers he is locked out the dogs attack him. He fights them off, killing one, and flees to a hospital where he is refused entrance. An elderly man (R. G. Armstrong) drives past, stopping to pick up the dead dog, and drives off again. The remaining dogs follow his pickup truck. Black passes out and is helped into the hospital. The locals believe he is unconscious and discuss the \\"situation\\"; however Black is awake and overhears everything, realising there is a greater threat than savage dogs at hand. The next day, Black finds a group of obelisks in the woods. He is about to examine one when Beebe appears, chased by dogs. The Old Man also arrives, and Black asks him to call off his dogs. The Old Man denies the dogs are his, but they retreat regardless. Black then sees that the obelisks all bear an ouroboros, the symbol of the Millennium Group. He visits the Old Man's home, where the two speak about the Group and its symbolism, and the coming millennium. The Old Man then brings Black to a clearing full of the wild dogs, where the latter realizes they are embodiments of the evil in the world. He approaches them, and stands his ground, being struck by several visions as he does so. The Old Man then explains that the world's balance between good and evil is being lost as the millennium approaches, and that Beebe's home, built on sacred ground, is one of the many small things upsetting this balance. Black rushes to Beebe's home, knowing the dogs will attack it. Beebe refuses to leave, but the house has been surrounded by five dogs; as they are killed they are seemingly endlessly replaced by others. The Old Man arrives, and insists the only way to rid the town of the dogs is burn down Beebe's house, which the trio do before fleeing. Back home in Seattle, Black refuses to sell his own home, telling his wife that they will move back into it together when their problems are resolved. Production Director Allen Coulter would return to direct another two episodes of the series. \\"Beware of the Dog\\" was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed by Allen Coulter. The episode was Coulter's first credit for the series, and he would return to helm \\"The Pest House\\" and \\"Siren\\" later in the second season. \\"Beware of the Dog\\" was the fifth episode to have been written by Morgan and Wong, after \\"Dead Letters\\", \\"522666\\" and \\"The Thin White Line\\" in the first season; and the second season premi√®re \\"The Beginning and the End\\". The duo would go on to pen a further ten episodes over the course of the second season, having taken the roles of co-executive producers for the season. Guest star Randy Stone was the casting director for Millennium and its sister show The X-Files. Stone was responsible for the casting of Henriksen in the role of Frank Black, and of the two lead roles in The X-Files. \\"Beware of the Dog\\" features the first appearance by R. G. Armstrong as The Old Man, a recurring character who would reappear in the two-part episodes \\"Owls\\" and \\"Roosters\\". Armstrong has been described as \\"a long-time favorite\\" of Morgan's. The episode makes use of Bobby Darin's song \\"As Long As I'm Singing\\" in a diegetic manner. Darin's music has been noted by Millennium resident composer Mark Snow as a hallmark of the works of Morgan and Wong. \\"Beware of the Dog\\" marked the pair's first use of the singer in Millennium, but his music would later feature in the episodes \\"Sense and Antisense\\", \\"Monster\\" and \\"Goodbye Charlie\\".Turn of the Tide, 15:01‚Äì15:35 Broadcast and reception \\"Beware of the Dog\\" originally aired on the Fox network on September 26, 1997.

Club Zack Handlen gave the episode a B+, finding it \\"endearingly batshit\\". Handlen felt that the episode was not entirely cohesive and that its ending was somewhat disappointing, but felt that overall the episode's imagery made up for this‚Äîsumming up this idea by saying \\"Millennium often seems to be at its best when sense is a secondary consideration\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, noting that its \\"atmospheric elements do not quite add up to a cohesive whole\\". Gibron felt that this resulted in \\"an episode that feels like the first half of a bad b-movie\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, awarded \\"Beware of the Dog\\" one-and-a- half stars out of five. Shearman felt the episode was so similar to The X-Files that it gave the impression that Millennium had \\"lost its own identity\\". He found that the script contained \\"enough wit in the dialogue\\" but that its plot seemed too \\"vague and elliptical\\". Writing for the Star Tribune, Bill Ward felt that the episode featured a \\"lighter\\" tone than usual, comparing it to The X-Files. Ward described the episode as taking \\"some nice turns en route to an ambivalent semiresolution\\".

It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on October 3, 1997. The episode was written by Chip Johannessen and directed by Thomas J. Wright. \\"Sense and Antisense\\" featured guest appearances from Clarence Williams III and Ricky Harris. Millennium centers on offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who investigates unusual crimes as part of the private investigative organisation the Millennium Group. In this episode, Black aids in the search for a man who is supposedly carrying a highly contagious virus and discovers the secret behind the Human Genome Project. Johannessen has described \\"Sense and Antisense\\" as having suffered from extensive script re-writes; his original version dealt more strongly with racial issues but was rewritten at the behest of the network's broadcast standards office. The episode earned a mixed reception from television critics, and was viewed by approximately 6.57 million households upon its initial broadcast. Plot Patient Zero (Clarence Williams III) tries to hail a taxi on a busy street, but is continually ignored. He is eventually picked up by Gerome Knox (Ricky Harris), but suffers a seizure in the back of the taxi, raving about a threat against his life. Knox takes him to hospital, where he is diagnosed as a drug addict. Zero is sedated, but becomes agitated when two men enter the hospital lobby; Knox helps him escape, believing his life is in danger. The two men, Wright and Patterson, quarantine the area, as Zero is carrying a highly contagious disease. Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is contacted for help in finding Zero, and travels to a briefing on the situation. It is explained that Zero is carrying a disease ordinarily confined to the Congo. Meanwhile, Zero and Knox are attempting to have a local newspaper run Zero's story, believing he has been infected in a racially motivated conspiracy akin to the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. Police locate and apprehend Zero, who manages to smear blood on Black's shirt. Black has the blood tested, and finds it free of any pathogen; meanwhile, the government center running the earlier briefing has vanished. Black realizes he was tricked into finding Zero for an ulterior motive, eventually learning that the organisation responsible is carrying out medical experiments on the homeless, and may be tied to the Millennium Group. Elsewhere a homeless man, acting similarly to Zero, attacks two policemen, and is killed in response. Black and fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigate, but are clearly not welcome. Black manages to obtain a blood sample from the dead man, and finds a stretcher tag which he believes is connected to the United States Department of Energy. Further examination of the blood of both Zero and the dead man reveal that their condition has been induced through gene therapy. Watts and Black theorize that the DOE is developing a biological weapon which would incite violence and rioting in a targeted population; they learn that the research is being conducted by scientists involved in the Human Genome Project. Later, the body of Knox is found at a nearby morgue. Later, Black and Watts, assisted by local police, raid an office building connected to the project, which they believe is using homeless shelters to test their pathogen. They hope to recover Zero in the raid, but find him cogent and working for the project‚Äîhis real name is Dr. William Kramer, and he denies any knowledge of the incident. Black believes Kramer was accidentally infected during his work, and finds a photograph in the man's office, showing him in military uniform, taking part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Production \\"Sense and Antisense\\" was written by Chip Johannessen, who went on to write a total of twelve episodes across all three seasons, including the series' final episode, \\"Goodbye to All That\\". The episode was directed by Thomas J. Wright; Wright had directed six episodes previously and would helm a further nineteen over the series' run. Wright would also go on to direct \\"Millennium\\", the series' crossover episode with its sister show The X-Files. Johannessen was ultimately unhappy with how the episode turned out, believing that it suffered as a result of frequent re-writes to the script. Johannessen's original draft focused more heavily on racial issues, which Fox's broadcast standards office objected to.

The episode also features music by Bobby Darin, a hallmark of Morgan and Wong's work. The episode has been well received by critics, and earned guest star Lauren Diewold a nomination at the 1998 Young Artist Awards. Plot Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to Springdale, Arkansas to investigate allegations of child abuse brought against a daycare owner, Penny Plott (Mary Gillis). Before he leaves Seattle, he takes his daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) shopping for shoes, but chastises her when she begins acting out for attention. In Arkansas, sheriff's deputy Bill Sherman (Chris Owens) discovers bite-marks on his son's skin after he returns home from the daycare. When his son refuses to discuss what happened, Sherman is convinced of the rumours about Plott. Black arrives in town, and pretends to be a local parent interested in using the daycare. His visit is interrupted by Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is investigating for Plott's defence. However, the two are forced to work together when one boy, Jason Wells, stops breathing. Despite attempts to revive him, the boy dies. Meanwhile, in Seattle, Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) takes Jordan to the dentist after she spits blood while brushing her teeth. The dentist tells her such an injury is most commonly caused by blunt force trauma. Catherine dismisses the idea outright, but Jordan mentions Black losing his temper during the shopping trip. An autopsy reveals Wells' death was the result of an asthma attack. However the ambitious district attorney, Gordon Roberts (Robert Wisden) believes Plott is somehow responsible. The investigation stalls until another child, Danielle Barbakow (Lauren Diewold), mentions overhearing Wells being physically abused by Plott. Plott is arrested by Sherman, who she reprimands sternly, reminding him that she looked after him as a child too, and has never been accused of anything in three decades of childcare work. Sherman sees she is incapable of what she has been accused of and continues to send his son to the daycare, but other parents protest, to the point of picketing and vandalizing the fence around the daycare. Black and Means discover that they have both been sent to investigate by the Group, realizing that this is some kind of test for them. They both come to believe that Barkabow, from whom Black senses a demonic presence, is responsible for Wells' death, and visit her home. Means speaks to Barkabow's mother while Black interviews the child. As they speak, Barkabow begins screaming and accuses Black of harming her; after he leaves the room she hits herself in the face and breaks her jaw. This leads Roberts, who learns that Black is under suspicion of harming Jordan, to arrest him for assault. Means has ultraviolet photographs taken of Barkabow's injuries, deduces that the girl was injured with an angel statue from her room. Means realizes that Black could not have wielded this statue, and Barkabow's mother admits to having heard her daughter hit herself. Black is released, and the Seattle investigation against him is dropped when Catherine defends him.

It premiered on the Fox network on October 24, 1997. The episode was written by Kay Reindl and Erin Maher, and directed by Rodman Flender. \\"A Single Blade of Grass\\" featured guest appearances by Floyd Red Crow Westerman and Michael Greyeyes. Millennium centers on offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who investigates unusual crimes as part of the private investigative organisation the Millennium Group. In this episode, Black investigates the murder of a Native American man, finding a cult who wish to bring about the end of American civilization. \\"A Single Blade of Grass\\" was the first episode of the series to have been penned by Reindl and Maher. It received mixed responses from critics, and was viewed by approximately 6.57 million households upon its initial broadcast. Plot In New York City, a young Native American man is forced by several others to ingest snake venom. The venom causes him to hallucinate, and one of the men, Joe Reynard (Michael Greyeyes) asks him to describe his visions. However, the poisoned man screams in agony and dies. His body is later found when a construction site is being excavated by archaeologists. A mummified body from centuries earlier is also found; when Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) arrives to investigate, he notices similarities between both corpses. The archaeologist in charge of the dig, Liz Michaels (Amy Steel) is adamant that the site should stay intact for further excavation, but foreman Richard Powell (Garry Chalk) and his mostly Native American crew insist building must continue. Black believes the killing took place in a hotel basement; finding the crime scene, he consults Michaels, who notes that symbols painted on the walls come from several different native cultures but all concern communication with the spirit world. Black visits a bar frequented by the native construction workers and their elderly mentor (Floyd Red Crow Westerman). Reynard is among their number; Black asks him about one of the symbols, and is told by the old man that the symbol is an ominous warning. After Black leaves, Reynard tells the others that he \\"is the one\\". The dead man is autopsied; his corpse had been dismembered and reconstructed. Michaels notes that this is a Seneca ritual aimed at reviving the dead to learn of spiritual matters. Later, Black and Michaels are called the construction site, where Powell is attempting to package and remove the ancient remains. Reynard and Powell begin fighting; the latter soon dies of a heart attack. When Black returns to his car, he finds a native face mask placed inside; Michaels explains that it represents the ability to cross from the material world into the spirit world. Black believes a secret native tribe is awaiting the downfall and apocalypse of the society of the white settlers; he theorizes that they believe his abilities are key to their prophecies of the end of the world. That night, Black is kidnapped by the group of natives. He is taken to the sewers and forced to consume snake venom; he sees visions, but insists they are from his psychic gift rather than from the venom. He predicts that the native tribes will reunite and that the buffalo will return to New York. However, he is soon rescued by Michaels and a group of police, who place Reynard and his tribe under arrest. As the tribe‚Äînow reunited in police custody‚Äîare led away, a travelling rodeo loses track of four buffalo, which run free through the city streets. Production \\"A Single Blade of Grass\\" is the first episode of Millennium to have been written by Kay Reindl and Erin Maher; the pair would pen two further episodes in the second season, and another in the third season. The episode was the only contribution to the series by director Rodman Flender. The episode featured the return of Black's near-psychic visions; a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in the second season. Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode, saying \\"I felt last year those visions were a cheat. The camera would go to a coffee cup and Frank would say, 'The murderer used a coffee cup.' It drove me nuts. What we were trying to do this year was elevate Frank's visions to a dream-like state, so he would have to interpret what he's seeing. There would be more mystical, symbolic imagery that might give him more of a sense of what's going on. I had wanted to strip away the gift for a long time and see if the show really played without it. But we got back into that\\".

However, Shearman felt positively about the episode's attempt to stand on its own rather than imitating sister show The X-Files, which he saw several prior episodes as having done.

It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on October 31, 1997. The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed by Ralph Hemecker. \\"The Curse of Frank Black\\" featured a guest appearance from Dean Winters. Millennium centers on offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who investigates unusual crimes as part of the private investigative organisation the Millennium Group. In this episode, Black tries to spend Halloween with his daughter, but is continually reminded of a figure from his past. \\"The Curse of Frank Black\\", which was inspired by the 1964 Japanese horror film Kwaidan, has received positive reviews from critics, with its minimalist plot being seen as its main strength. Plot On Halloween, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is carving a jack-o'-lantern while preparing to take his daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) trick-or-treating. As he leaves to collect her, he notices a demonic figure watching him from across the street. That night, Jordan deliberately passes by one house, telling Black that it is haunted. Black tells her there are no such thing as ghosts, but is reminded of a moment from his past. In a flashback, we see a five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock the door of the same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) answers and invites Black inside. Crocell is a Second World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed when the young Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts. After bringing Jordan back to her mother, Catherine (Megan Gallagher), Black is driving home when he notices several youths egging a house‚Äîthe house he once shared with Catherine and Jordan, and in which his friend Bob Bletcher was killed. He goes inside, and overhears several teenagers gathered in the basement trying to scare each other with the story of Bletcher's murder. Black interrupts, scaring off the youths‚Äîand is again reminded of his past, recalling his reaction when Crocell was found to have committed suicide. As Black leaves the house, he picks up an egg carton discarded by the fleeing teenagers and throws the remaining eggs at the walls. When Black arrives home, he leafs through the day's mail, finally noticing that the numbers \\"268\\" and the letters \\"ACT\\" have been appearing to him throughout the day, including Crocell's door number being 268. Black takes these coincidences to be pointing him towards a Bible verse, Acts of the Apostles 26:8‚Äî\\"why should it be thought incredible by you that God raises the dead?\\". Black then hears something moving in his attic, and investigates. He discovers Crocell's ghost, who claims to have been sent back to warn Black that he should abandon his work with the Millennium Group, and return to live with his wife and child instead. Crocell warns that Black will end up as lonely as he did, but when Black dismisses this, the spirit vanishes. The following day, Black returns to his old house to clean up where it was egged. As he cleans, he momentarily glimpses the same demonic figure as the day before, but he ignores it and continues his work. Production \\"The Curse of Frank Black\\" was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed by Ralph Hemecker. Hemecker had previously helmed the first season episode \\"The Well- Worn Lock\\", and a further three in the third season. He would return for the third season episode \\"Exegesis\\". Morgan and Wong had previously collaborated to write several episodes of the first season. The duo would go on to pen a number of episodes over the course of the second season, having taken the roles of co-executive producers for the season. Morgan and Wong's script for the episode was influenced by the 1964 Japanese horror film Kwaidan and features very little dialogue. Morgan felt that Henriksen was the right actor for such a script, describing him as \\"so great with looks\\". Morgan also credited Hemecker with \\"a lot of the episode's tone\\", finding the director's work to have been \\"beautiful\\". Broadcast and reception \\"The Curse of Frank Black\\" was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on October 31, 1997. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.7 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately 5.59 million households, and left the episode the eighty-fourth most-viewed broadcast that week. The episode received positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, calling it \\"the best episode of Millennium yet, by a long chalk\\". Handlen felt that the episode effectively scaled the series' grandiose apocalyptic tone down to one man's struggle, making both the series and Frank Black more understandable to viewers. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4 out of 5, \\"moody, bamboozling\\" and \\"truly creepy\\". Gibron also felt that the episode's structure, based on \\"hidden hints and secret connections\\", foreshadowed Morgan and Wong's later work on the film Final Destination. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"The Curse of Frank Black\\" five stars out of five, feeling that \\"it's simple, and it's brave, and it's curiously moving\\". Shearman felt that the episode's minimalism‚Äîits paucity of dialogue and music‚Äîwas key to its tone, and praised Henriksen's expressiveness for helping to shape this.

It originally aired on the Fox network on November 14, 1997. The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed by Thomas J. Wright. \\"The Hand of St. Sebastian\\" featured a guest appearance from C. C. H. Pounder. Millennium Group offender profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) travel to Germany to locate a preserved relic of Saint Sebastian, unintentionally discovering cracks within the unity of the Group. \\"The Hand of St. Sebastian\\" was inspired by Wong's research into Freemasonry and the Knights Templar; Wong wanted to replicate the disharmony of these societies within the Millennium Group. The episode has received mixed responses from critics, and was viewed by approximately 6.7 percent of the available audience in its initial broadcast. Plot In 998, a monk is betrayed by his compatriot, and shot to death by archers. As they search his robe to find their objective‚Äîthe mummified hand of Saint Sebastian‚Äîthey notice a tattoo on the man's body; an ouroboros, symbol of the Millennium Group. In 1998, modern Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) asks his colleague Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) for help with a case the Group have not authorized; he remains cryptic as to what it is. They travel to Germany to investigate the murder of a Dr. Schlossburg, whose lab is found to house a mummified body. The two are arrested by German police, but when the police realize they have apprehended fellow investigators they promise cooperation. However, the pair learn that Schlossburg has already been cremated; later they narrowly escape death when their rental car has been rigged with a car bomb. Black connects the attempt on their lives to Schlossburg's murder. He demands details of the case from Watts, who explains that the mummy found earlier dates to early Christianity, the time when the Millennium Group first convened. However, they realize they are being tailed by two men, and return to their hotel. There, they are met by Cheryl Andrews (C. C. H. Pounder), a fellow Group member who has worked with them in the past. She offers her help but Watts declines it. Watts is later able to access Schlossburg's computer files; meanwhile, the doctor is found to be alive, regaining consciousness in a hospital bed and telling police his assailant was Watts. Andrews tells Black she has been sent to prevent Watts acting outside the Group's remit; she gives Black a contact number and leaves. Later, Black returns to Schlossburg's lab and finds Watts, who explains that a knightly order, the Knights Chroniclers, had possessed the relic of Saint Sebastian at the turn of the second millennium; the hand imparts knowledge to its possessor that will help to overcome the evils associated with the turn of the millennium. Watts reveals that Schlossburg had uncovered the order's burial ground. Black and Watts learn that Schlossburg is alive and visit him; the doctor does not recognize Watts, but insists that his attacker identified himself as \\"Peter Watts\\". He reveals the locations of the burial ground, in a peat bog. Black and Watts leave to reach it; Schlossburg is murdered shortly afterwards by two assassins. At the bog, the pair find a mummified corpse clutching the relic; however, they have been followed by the police, and Watts is arrested for Schlossburg's murder. Black tracks down Andrews at the storage building where the relic has been taken. They are ambushed by the two assassins, and during their escape, Black mentions where the relic is hidden. Andrews immediately turns on Black; the ambush was a trick to draw the information out of Black, while she had engineered events to use Watts as a fall man to discredit the Group. However, the police are able to intervene, hearing everything and rescuing Black. Later, Watts and Black study the relic, but Black is convinced that their own convictions will be more important to them than mystical artefacts. Production \\"The Hand of St. Sebastian\\" was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong. It was the ninth episode to have been written by the pair, who had penned several across the first and second seasons. The pair had also taken the roles of co-executive producers for the season. \\"The Hand of St. Sebastian\\" was directed by Thomas J. Wright; Wright had directed eight episodes previously and would helm a further seventeen over the series' run. Wright would also go on to direct \\"Millennium\\", the series' crossover episode with its sister show The X-Files. The episode was driven by Wong's desire to write an episode focussing on Watts, as he wanted to showcase O'Quinn as an actor. Wong also felt \\"that by revealing that the Millennium Group had existed for centuries and setting the episode overseas, that would give the story greater scope and weight\\". The introduction of schisms within the Group was inspired by Wong's research into the Knights Templar and Freemasonry, as he considered these secretive organizations to have mirrored the way he wanted to present the Group, and he felt each contained factions or reactionary elements which he wanted to recreate. The episode features the penultimate appearance by C. C. H. Pounder as pathologist Cheryl Andrews. Pounder portrayed the character in four other episodes, appearing across all three seasons. Broadcast and reception \\"The Hand of St. Sebastian\\" was first broadcast on the Fox network on November 14, 1997. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 6.7 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately households, and left the episode the eightieth most-viewed broadcast that week. \\"The Hand of St. Sebastian\\" has received mixed responses from critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode a \\"B+\\", finding it to contain an entertaining mix of mysticism and espionage. However, he considered the revelation that Andrews was a turncoat within the Group to be confusing, finding it unclear how a human villain could be defined within a series already making use of demons and theological evil. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, praising the guest performances by Pounder and Hall. Gibron wrote that the episode had a \\"feature film\\" feel, and described it as one of the best episodes of the season. However, Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"The Hand of St. Sebastian\\" one star out of five. Shearman felt that by this point, the series no longer resembled what it had been in its previous season, derisively comparing it to the Indiana Jones film series. He wrote that Henriksen's portrayal of Frank Black seemed \\"weakened\\" in the episode, as the actor had built a credible and deep character who now seemed entirely unlike his former self.

Biography He was born to the expatriate Cretan Charalambos Zymvrakakis in Nafplio in 1858. He graduated the Hellenic Army Academy as an Artillery Ensign. Named 2nd Lieutenant in 1881, he went on to continue his studies at Orl√©ans in France. In 1897, he volunteered for and fought in the Cretan Revolt in the Greek expeditionary corps under Colonel Timoleon Vassos. He later became an active member of the Military League, and it was he who suggested, following the Goudi coup, to call upon the Cretan Eleftherios Venizelos to come to Greece. Subsequently he served as adjutant to King George I of Greece and King Constantine I of Greece during the Balkan Wars. He was then promoted to Major General and appointed commander of the newly raised 11th Infantry Division at Thessaloniki in late 1913. From this position he was among the main driving figures behind the pro-Venizelist National Defence coup d'√©tat of August 1916, which established the Provisional Government of National Defence in the city. He helped organize the new government's army, and led the National Defence Army Corps on the Macedonian front in 1917 and until the Battle of Skra-di-Legen in May 1918. During the Battle of Doiran in 1918 he commanded the Greek forces (Serres Division and Crete Division). Subsequently he was tasked with the occupation of Western and Eastern Thrace, territories that had been ceded to Greece from Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire respectively. In the latter case he defeated the resistance offered by the remaining Ottoman forces in the region. Following the electoral defeat of the Venizelists in 1920, he was dismissed from his post. He died in Athens in 1928.

It premiered on the Fox network on February 6, 1998. The episode was written by Michael R. Perry and directed Roderick J. Pridy. \\"The Mikado\\" featured a guest appearance by Allan Zinyk as Brian Roedecker. After a group of boys witness a murder via a live webcam feed, Millennium Group profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) realizes that the culprit is an old adversary who has learned to exploit the internet to continue his killing spree while avoiding capture. Perry was inspired to write the episode after considering the \\"dark side\\" of the internet, drawing influence from Jennifer Ringley's JenniCam website. Avatar, the episode's antagonist, was based on real-life murderer the Zodiac Killer. \\"The Mikado\\" was seen by over five million households in its initial broadcast, and has received positive reviews from critics. Plot A group of friends browse the internet for pornography, finding a live stream of a woman bound to a chair. Behind her a number is painted on the wall; when the feed's web counter reaches the painted number, a masked man appears and cuts the girl's throat. The boys quickly print an image of the feed as proof of what they have seen, just before the website disappears. Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) finds that police across the United States have received calls from witnesses to the killing. The police believe it to be a hoax but Black is convinced of its authenticity. He and fellow Group members Brian Roedecker (Allan Zinyk) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) identify the victim as Rebecca Damsen. Damsen's email correspondence leads them to a San Jose address; Watts finds the bodies of both the owner and Damsen in a nearby graveyard. By the bodies is another number, which they determine to be an IP address. The IP address leads to another live feed similar in nature to the first one. However, the chair is empty this time. There is another number painted on the wall, which Black recognizes as a case file number from his time in the FBI‚Äîthe case concerned Avatar, a serial killer who was able to evade all attempts at capture. Avatar sends Black a coded message twice, and places a woman in the chair on the feed, keeping her face hidden. Roedecker realizes that, through image differencing, the two messages contain additional information‚Äîa sound clip from The Mikado, known to be Avatar's favourite operetta. Black determines that another set of numbers visible on the feed are latitude and longitude co-ordinates for San Francisco. The San Francisco Police Department are uncooperative, however. After Black, Roedecker and Watts attempt to keep the feed counter from rising by recreating the live feed and substituting it, the second girl is murdered before the feed's counter reaches the allotted number. Avatar leaves another clue after the killing, which leads to two further video feeds‚Äîone shows a third set like the others, again with an empty chair, while the other shows the exterior of a mobile home. Police are able to locate the mobile home, but an officer is killed by a shotgun rigged to the front door, before the trailer is obliterated by a series of explosions. Black travels to San Francisco, finding an abandoned theater whose marquee is displaying The Mikado. He is shot at by a masked gunman and gives chase; however, he soon sees that the attacker is another kidnap victim, a gun tied to her arm in an attempt to trick Black into shooting her. Watts tells Black that they found a charred body in the remains of the trailer, but Black tells him it is just another victim, and Avatar will most likely fall silent again - for a while. Production \\"The Mikado\\" is the first episode of Millennium to have been written by Michael R. Perry, who would go on to pen a further four episodes in the third season. The episode is the final one helmed by director Roderick J. Pridy, who had also taken the reins on \\"Covenant\\" in the first season. Perry was inspired to write the episode upon wondering whether the internet, about which he had only heard positive remarks, had a \\"dark side\\". He was shown Jennifer Ringley's JenniCam website, which provided a constant webcam view of her daily life, and wondered what sort of investigations would arise if a murder were witnessed on a similar broadcast.Perry, 01:10‚Äì03:32 The other main inspiration for the episode was the real-life Zodiac Killer, who formed the basis for the fictional Avatar.Perry, 20:10‚Äì21:26 Perry's script was later given a \\"polish\\" by executive producer James Wong, with Perry stating that roughly ninety percent of the material is his own work.Perry, 03:50‚Äì04:09 Several women in the episode, including possible murder victims investigated by Black and Roedecker, are named after Perry's sisters.Perry, 05:40‚Äì05:54 After principal photography had finished for the episode, additional inserts were shot to add more variety to scenes featuring a lot of dialogue; Perry noted that this was something he had learned about from Wong and felt the technique was put to \\"great use\\".Perry, 00:09‚Äì00:52 & 07:45‚Äì07:56 Filming several of the episode's scenes, including the webcam feeds and footage Black watches of police officers investigating suspects was filmed in a deliberately low-resolution manner, on handheld cameras, as Perry felt footage that was too clean and high-quality would lessen the episode's tension, citing The Blair Witch Project as an example of how this approach has later been put to use.Perry, 09:30‚Äì10:50 \\"The Mikado\\" featured Allan Zinyk's last appearance as Group member Brian Roedecker.

Club Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode an A‚àí, calling it \\"one of the strongest episodes of the season\\". VanDerWerff felt that the episode accurately depicted the general unease about the growing role of the internet in the late 1990s; she also reflected that it follows the \\"serial killer of the week\\" formula of the series' first season while retaining the second season's \\"more mystical, supernatural bent\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4 out of 5, calling it \\"very compelling\\". Gibron compared the episode to the films Seven and 8mm; he also felt that the unresolved plot helped to temper concerns about Black's seeming infallibility. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"The Mikado\\" three- and-a-half stars out of five.

It premiered on the Fox network on February 27, 1998. The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed by Allen Coulter. \\"The Pest House\\" featured guest appearances by Melinda McGraw, Justin Louis and Michael Massee. Millennium Group offender profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigate a series of murders mimicking urban legends. The case soon leads them to a psychiatric hospital for violent criminals, where all is not as it seems. \\"The Pest House\\" marked the second of three contributions by Coulter, and saw past Morgan and Wong collaborator McGraw once again work for the writing duo. The episode received positive reviews from critics, and was viewed by approximately 5.59 million households in its initial broadcast. Plot A young couple sit in a car, sharing a story of a serial killer from the area. They hear sounds outside, and the boyfriend steps out to see what they are. His girlfriend is terrified when she hears sounds of a struggle, and investigates to find him dangling above the car, dead. Millennium Group members Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) examine the crime scene. Black is skeptical when Watts notes that similar killings have occurred in the past, believing it is simply an urban legend. However, an inmate at the psychiatric hospital nearby was committed for similar murders. Unconvinced that he could have escaped, the pair nevertheless visit the facility. They meet Dr. Ellen Stoller (Melinda McGraw), who reluctantly assists them in interviewing their suspect, E. Jacob Woodcock. Woodcock admits the killing fits his methods, but denies involvement. The interview is terminated when two inmates begin fighting. That night, another couple is brutally killed on the highway. Black and Watts investigate, but they deem the deaths unconnected. However, Black notices that the newest murders are identical to the prior crimes of \\"Bear\\", one of the inmates involved in the previous day's fight. Stoller is adamant Bear cannot be responsible‚Äîuntil she finds the victim's hand in the cafeteria's stew. Bear insists someone took something \\"from inside\\" him, but has a seizure before he can explain. Between this incident and Woodcock insisting that Edward (Justin Louis) has stolen his dreams, Black realizes someone in the hospital is causing the deaths. After seeing a vision of Stoller being stabbed in her car, Black warns her that she may be in danger, which she rebukes. However, she is approached by another patient, Purdue (Michael Massee), who insists that Edward is stealing dreams, but will not steal his. Watts researches the facility's inmates to find who has committed stabbings in the victims' cars, concluding that Purdue is the one this profile fits. Black attempts to warn Stoller, but she has already driven away from the hospital. Black gives chase, scaring her, and she out- paces him before pulling into a filling station. However, the attendant alerts Stoller that someone is hiding in the back seat of her car, and manages to bring her to the safety of his office. Black arrives and finds the car empty. He drives Stoller back to the hospital while the attendant attempts to call the police. However, he is killed before making the call. Black searches for Purdue in the hospital, but encounters Edward, who tells him a nurse was murdered years before by Woodcock. Edward believes the patients can be cured by having the evil drained from their bodies. The electricity is cut and the lights go off. Black and Stoller roam in the dark, finding the body of the night nurse. Purdue's voice is heard over the intercom, and the pair move to the office with the tannoy equipment to find him. Edward attacks with a knife‚ÄîStoller sees him shape-shift into Purdue, then Bear, and then Woodcock. However, Purdue fights and kills him, proclaiming it \\"the sanest thing I ever did.\\" Black theorizes that Edward somehow absorbed the killers' violent impulses into himself, but was unable to refrain from acting upon them. Production \\"The Pest House\\" was the second episode directed by Allen Coulter. \\"The Pest House\\" was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed by Allen Coulter. The episode was Coulter's second contribution to the series‚Äîhe had previously directed \\"Beware of the Dog\\" and would return to helm \\"Siren\\" later in the second season. \\"The Pest House\\" was the eleventh episode to have been written by Morgan and Wong, who had penned several across the first and second seasons. The pair had also taken the roles of co-executive producers for the season. Guest star Melinda McGraw had appeared in several episodes of Millennium sister show The X-Files, in a recurring role as Melissa Scully, debuting in an episode of that series also penned by Morgan and Wong.

Handlen felt that the episode began with an \\"iffy\\" premise which more closely resembled an episode of The X-Files, but by its end had managed to make it something more distinct and separate. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, writing that it was \\"an episode that pays lip service to the Group's interest in this case to merely go back to the same old \\"killer of the week\\" conceit\\". However, Gibron felt that \\"the acting is wonderful, and the actual story very moody and atmospheric\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"The Pest House\\" three- and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman praised guest star Massee's performance, and felt that the script was \\"great fun\\", noting that it worked as a more serious version of the 1996 film Scream.

It originally aired on the Fox network on March 6, 1998. The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed by Thomas J. Wright. \\"Owls\\" featured guest appearances by Kristen Cloke, R. G. Armstrong and Kimberly Patton. Millennium Group offender profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) become embroiled in a growing schism within the Group, prompted by the discovery of the True Cross. \\"Owls\\" is a two-part episode, with the story continued in \\"Roosters\\". \\"Owls\\" was inspired by the earlier second season episode \\"The Hand of St. Sebastian\\", with Morgan wishing to introduce secular beliefs within the Millennium Group. The episode has received positive responses from critics, and was viewed by approximately 5.5 percent of the available audience in its initial broadcast. Plot In Damascus, Syria, a team of men excavate a piece of petrified wood‚Äîthe True Cross. They are interrupted by the arrival of two armed assailants; one of the excavators, Le Fur, clutches the wood as a shield, and the attackers' guns jam when they attempt to fire on him. However, when Le Fur attempts to smuggle the wood out of the country, he is killed by a bomb at the airport and the cross is taken by a man named Helmut Gunsche. Gunsche later calls his employer, Rudolf Axmann, to inform him of the theft; Axmann's cufflinks bear a Germanic rune. In Seattle, Washington, Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher) meets Clear Knight (Kimberly Patton), an executive at Aerotech International. Knight offers Black a position as a counselor for the fledgling company, which she accepts. Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) meets several other Group members to discuss the competing factions within the Group‚Äîthe Roosters believe that the coming millennium will trigger a theological apocalypse, while the Owls believe the end of the world will be a secular, material disaster. The discovery and theft of the True Cross threatens to tip the internecine conflict in the favor of the Owls, leaving them in control of the Group; the assembled members are Roosters and wish to stop this. Meanwhile, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), another Group member, sees a vision of an angel. She begins researching her visions, and is scouted by a Mr. Johnston, who asks her to work with the Owl faction. Meanwhile, Catherine's husband Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) returns home to find Watts in the house. Watts explains that Black's modem has been bugged; the two argue heatedly and Black declares he is done with the Group. Watts and Means discuss the theft of the Cross; Watts explains that it is fabled to grant its possessor invulnerability, and that the Nazis had attempted to find it to turn the tide of the Second World War. Means believes that the Owls would not have stolen it, as they would not wish to risk sparking a civil war within the Group. Elsewhere, Catherine leaves work at Aerotech one evening, and finds that her car will not start. She is met by Knight, who invites the Black family to her home; it is seen that she wears the same Germanic rune cufflinks as Axmann. Johnston is driving along a quiet road, when his car is overtaken by Gunsche. Gunsche forces Johnston off the road, strangles him to death, and places a piece of wood‚Äîmeant to resemble the Cross‚Äîinside Johnston's car, before setting him and the car ablaze. The remains are later examined by Watts and Means; they cannot determine if the wood is the Cross or not. However, Watts finds Johnston's partially burnt diary, and reads an entry about his contacting Means. Suspecting betrayal, he expels Means from the Group immediately. Meanwhile, Black realizes that a painting he has seen in Knight's office was a watercolor by Adolf Hitler. He then notices two men watching his house from a car. He approaches and holds them at gunpoint, and they identify themselves as Group members; however, one of them discreetly draws his own pistol. Production \\"Owls\\" was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong. It was the twelfth episode to have been written by the pair, who had penned several across the first and second seasons of the series. The pair had also taken the roles of co-executive producers for the season. \\"Owls\\" was directed by Thomas J. Wright; Wright had directed eleven episodes previously and would helm a further fourteen over the series' run. Wright would also go on to direct \\"Millennium\\", the series' crossover episode with its sister show The X-Files. Morgan has noted that the plot for \\"Owls\\", and the concluding two-part episode \\"Roosters\\", grew out of the internecine conflict seen within the Millennium Group in \\"The Hand of St. Sebastian\\", an earlier second season episode he had penned with Wong. Morgan had wanted to introduce secular elements to the series' focus on eschatology, after the theological focus of the earlier episode; he began focussing on ideas such as biological warfare as a possible way of depicting the end of the world‚Äîan idea which would later play out in the two-part episodes concluding the second season, \\"The Time Is Now\\" and \\"The Fourth Horseman\\". Guest star Kimberly Patton had worked with Morgan and Wong on several occasions prior to this episode, appearing in \\"Blood\\", an episode of The X-Files they had written, as well as acting in Space: Above and Beyond, the pair's short-lived science fiction series. Broadcast and reception \\"Owls\\" was first broadcast on the Fox network on March 6, 1998. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.5 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately households, and left the episode the seventy-ninth most-viewed broadcast that week. The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode an \\"A\\", finding it \\"exhilarating\\" despite its seemingly nonsensical plot. However, VanDerWerff felt that the episode moved at a constant and entertaining pace, and that it and \\"Roosters\\" never felt stretched out longer than they should have been. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 5 out of 5, writing that it \\"poses amazing questions while precisely and purposefully offering up the answers\\". Gibron felt that the episode was a perfect summation of the themes which had been hinted at in the earlier episode \\"Beware of the Dog\\", and would set the tone for the season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"Owls\\" three-and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman felt the episode was entertaining and fun, but that its plot was confusing and cluttered. However, he felt that the episode served as a better version of \\"The Hand of St. Sebastian\\", with the slower pace of a two-part episode allowing for greater \\"gravitas\\" to be given to the storyline.

The occupants claim to be fellow members of the Millennium Group, but soon begin shooting; Black takes cover and returns fire, shooting one of the men before the car escapes. The car is later found abandoned. Meanwhile, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke) is examining evidence relating to Johnston's murder; she discovers that Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) had suppressed infrared post-mortem photographs. Learning of this, the Elder (Philip Baker Hall)‚Äîa high-ranking Group official‚Äîdemands an explanation; Watts divulges that the murdered man had been conspiring to pit conflicting factions within the Group against each other. Watts had found evidence in one of the photographs which may have influenced such a schism and wished to keep it hidden until its significance could be known. The Elder agrees, and similarly decides to hold off on testing which would reveal if an artefact in Johnston's possession was an authentic piece of the True Cross. Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) is approached at her new job by a colleague, who reveals that the company is part of the Odessa network. Meanwhile, Black visits Catherine's boss Clear Knight (Kimberly Patton), experiencing visions of Nazi Germany after seeing a watercolour painting in her office. Later that night Black is visited by Means and the Old Man (R. G. Armstrong), another high-ranking Group member. They explain to Black that the Group has, throughout history, been privy to scientific discoveries of which the public has no knowledge. Johnstone had theorised the existence of a tear in the universe which would reach Earth in several decades; his death may be connected to this theory. The Old Man also explains that the Group has been infiltrated in the hopes of splintering it, by members of the Odessa network‚Äîa faction founded by fugitive Nazis which had previously been known for its anti-communist work and has now turned its focus to the Millennium Group. When Catherine finds her colleague dead, she flees from the company premises and finds her husband, who has deduced that her job offer was simply a way for Odessa to reach him. Elsewhere, an Odessa agent murders the Old Man in Frank's home; the loss serves to reunite Watts, Means and Black, who contrive a plan to strike back at Odessa. As the Elder conducts a funeral for the Old Man, a carbomb kills his assassin, while Odessa's Paraguayan headquarters is destroyed and Knight's company is raided and closed.

However, Handlen felt that, mostly as a result of its characters and the performances given, the episode served as a satisfying conclusion to the story arc. Handlen particularly highlighted O'Quinn's performance, reflecting positively on his increased importance in the series and noting that \\"portrayal of an acolyte struggling with the demands and doubts of his faith does as much for Millennium as Henriksen's work\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated \\"Roosters\\" 5 out of 5, calling both it and \\"Owls\\" a \\"dense, deceptive set of shows\\" which focus on the personal and ideological conflicts between their characters.

Shearman felt that the plot failed to capitalise on what had been set up by \\"Owls\\", offering more exposition than resolution. However, he highlighted the work of Thomas J.

It premiered on the Fox network on March 20, 1998. Millennium concerns offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) as he investigates crimes for the Millennium Group. The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong, and directed Allen Coulter. \\"Siren\\" featured guest appearances by Vivian Wu, Tzi Ma and Kristen Cloke. When offender profiler Black investigates several deaths on a cargo ship, he encounters a mysterious woman who shows him visions of a life in which he had never joined the Millennium Group. Upon recovering, his experience leads him to doubt his role in the organisation. \\"Siren\\" was viewed by approximately 5.68 million households during its original broadcast. The episode received positive critical reviews, with one reviewer drawing comparisons with the film It's a Wonderful Life. Plot synopsis Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is an offender profiler working for a private investigative firm called the Millennium Group, who consult with local or federal law enforcement on criminal cases. The Millennium Group, and Black, specialise in examining violent crimes or those of a millenarian nature. As a cargo ship pulls into harbour, it is surrounded by Immigration and Naturalization Service agents. On board, the captain, Law (Tzi Ma), sends two of his crew to kill a \\"monster\\" in the cargo hold. Before they can do so, the ship is boarded and the men arrested. Inside the hold, INS agents find a glamorous woman (Vivian Wu) bound in chains. Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) has brought their daughter Jordan to the hospital where she works; there, Jordan sees the captive woman and is convinced she will be significant to her father. Catherine brings the woman's file to Black, who becomes interested in the case. However, attempts to communicate with her fail, as a translator insists the woman is speaking a wholly unknown language. Stymied, Black and fellow Group member Lara Means (Kristen Cloke) investigate the ship, finding several bodies hidden in a crate, all having died of exposure. Black then interviews Law and his crew individually, each time being given a contradicting story of how the woman came to be on board the ship. However, they all agree that after she boarded, crew were discovered daily, dead of exposure on the ship's bow; Law had the woman chained up in the belief she was responsible. Black traces the woman's fingerprints through a Millennium Group database, finding they belong to a Tamara Shui Fa Lee, who disappeared at sea near Hong Kong ten years prior‚Äîand who Black believes is now dead. Black visits \\"Lee\\" at the hospital, where she speaks to him in perfect English, discussing personal events from his life of which she would have no knowledge. As he drives home, he sees her on the side of the highway and stops to investigate; however, he finds no sign of her and returns home, where he shares an intimate dinner with Catherine and Jordan, later retiring to bed with Catherine‚Äîdespite their estrangement. Black gradually notices more differences from how his life had been, realizing he has never been a member of the Millennium Group and founded a private investigation firm after leaving the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Returning home again one day, he sees a demon holding Jordan's lifeless body. Back on the highway, an ambulance crew try to resuscitate Black, who has been outside his car through the night after his vision of Lee. After he comes to, he realizes this alternate reality was Lee showing him a life without the Millennium Group. However, he is left unsure whether his role within the Group is protecting his family from evil, or exposing them to it. Black seeks out Lee in a refugee camp; meanwhile, Law and his crewmen are also tracking her, conspiring to kill her to avenge their fellow crew. Lee turns the men against each other with her visions, before Black arrives to rescue her. As Black questions her as to the Group's influence, she resumes speaking in her unknown tongue, leaving Black without the answer he seeks. Production \\"Siren\\" was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong. It was the fourteenth episode to have been written by the pair, who had penned several across the first and second seasons of the series. The pair had also taken the roles of co-executive producers during the second season. The episode was directed by Allen Coulter, in his third and final contribution to the series; Coulter had previously helmed the earlier second season episodes \\"Beware of the Dog\\" and \\"The Pest House\\". Release and reception \\"Siren\\" was first broadcast on the Fox Network on March 20, 1998. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.8 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately households, and left the episode the eighty-second most-viewed broadcast that week. The episode received mildly positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode a \\"B\\". She compared its central premise to the film It's A Wonderful Life, and considered this a common trope in television; VanDerWerff also felt that the plot structure, with a supernatural event being encountered during a criminal investigation, was overly reminiscent of Millennium sister show The X-Files. However, she considered that the episode worked well overall, highlighting its alternate-reality section and its decision not to answer every question raised. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3 out of 5, finding that its motif of temptation was an intriguing one, but that overall the episode's spiritual themes were muddied by its reliance on a \\"routine cops and robbers\\" framework. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"Siren\\" three stars out of five. Shearman found the episode's alternate reality section to be \\"touching\\" but \\"not especially revelatory\\", considering it and the episode as a whole to have been more interesting in premise than in execution. Shearman compared the episode to \\"The Curse of Frank Black\\" and \\"Midnight of the Century\\", though finding that the immigration plot left it less focused and interesting than those installments.

It premiered on the Fox network on April 3, 1998. The episode was written by Chip Johannessen, and directed by Thomas J. Wright. In this episode, offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) tracks two women who have escaped from prison; they believe that one of them is pregnant with a virginal conception. \\"In Arcadia Ego\\" featured guest appearances from Mary-Pat Green and Ed Lauter. Plot In a women's prison, inmates and lovers \\"Sonny\\" Palmer (Mary-Pat Green) and Janette Viti (Missy Crider) begin an escape attempt by overpowering a guard; when attacking a second guard, Viti is shot. Sonny beats the guard in response, before realizing Viti has survived as the bullet was stopped by a badge on her stolen uniform; the two believe they see a face in the flattened round. Later, offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is called to investigate the breakout by prison warden Kellard (Ed Lauter). Kellard enumerates Sonny's history of violence, having killed both her stepfather and husband, and now a guard. Black is puzzled by her need to escape, however, as her parole date is only a few months away. Sonny and Viti carjack a motorist, bringing him to a house where they seem disappointed to find no one home. They abandon the car with its owner tied in the back seat, before fleeing to a motel where it is revealed that Viti is heavily pregnant. Meanwhile, Black researches Sonny's history, finding that she seems to lash out defensively rather than aggressively‚Äîshe killed the stepfather that was abusing her sister, and killed her husband after a history of domestic abuse. He believes her escape was an attempt to protect someone else; a report by the hijacked motorist reveals Viti's pregnancy to the investigators. Black believes one of the prison guards is the father; a guard named Shiffer admits to raping her under sedation in the infirmary. Sonny and Viti visit a clinic for a sonogram, but leave abruptly when they realize the guard they attacked died of his injuries. Black and fellow investigator Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) learn that the sonogram revealed a placenta praevia, which could prove fatal during labor. They also conjecture that the couple may try fleeing by rail, as Sonny had previously worked on a railroad. Black tracks them to a boxcar, but is taken hostage by Sonny; Viti has now gone into labor. Black explains that Viti's rapist has confessed, which angers Sonny‚Äîshe believes the pregnancy is a virgin birth. The police begin to surround the boxcar as Viti's contractions intensify; Sonny demands medical staff be brought in and two police officers instead pose as paramedics. Black warns Sonny to search their medical supplies and to avoid exposing herself to police snipers. Black aids with Viti's delivery, but she dies of blood loss. The child is born white, apparently ruling out the black Shiffer as its father. Reacting to Viti's death, Sonny runs outside and mimes drawing a gun, committing suicide by cop. Black later travels to the house the couple had abandoned the car at, meeting a religious couple who had been praying for Sonny and Viti during their sentences, who agree to adopt the child. Production The script for \\"In Arcadia Ego\\" was written by Chip Johannessen, who went on to write a total of twelve episodes across all three seasons, including the series' final episode, \\"Goodbye to All That\\". The episode was directed by Thomas J. Wright, who helmed a total of twenty-six episodes across all three seasons.

Handlen praised Henriksen's acting in the episode, finding that he had given the character of Frank Black more dramatic weight here and throughout the second season compared to the calmer portrayals of the first season. However, Handlen considered the ending of the episode to be too \\"neat and tidy\\", resolving a potentially profound development for the series in quite a perfunctory manner. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"In Arcadia Ego\\" one star out of five. Shearman called the episode \\"uncharacteristically crass\\" and \\"simplistic to a fault\\", finding its characters much too one-dimensional to tell an effective story. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3 out of 5, comparing it favorably to the first-season episode \\"The Wild and the Innocent\\", which similarly shared themes of parents on the run to safeguard a child. However, Gibron was critical of the episode's focus on \\"the miracle of birth\\", finding it uncharacteristic of the series.

Several days earlier, Black meets Emma Shetterly (Gwynyth Walsh), the school's vice-principal. Shetterly explains that five students have claimed to be experiencing visions of Saint Mary; she believes the girls involved are unlikely candidates for divine visions, particularly the trouble-making Clare McKenna (Genele Templeton). Black speaks to the girls, who claim to have had visions during a sermon by Reverend Hanes; Hanes' son Alex refutes this. Black returns to Shetterly's office, and is met by Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who works with her husband in the Millennium Group. Means explains that the Group has explored many such reported visions. Later, Means and Black listen to McKenna reading a passage from the Bible. Afterwards, McKenna reveals that she knows a great deal about the Polaroid Man who kidnapped Black months earlier. Means receives a vision herself during the conversation, and becomes convinced that McKenna is a prophet of some sort. Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed that Mary Magdalene was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary, but of Mary Magdalene. Later, Black is informed that the girls are missing. She and Means search the woods, finding the girls in a grotto. They are with a teacher from the school, Ben Fisher (John Pyper-Ferguson) who attacks Means; she subdues him and he is arrested. She later confronts him, and it is revealed he is a former Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers. When Black later learns that Fisher has been released, she fears for McKenna's life. She rushes to the school, knowing the girls will be at a prayer meeting. She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna. Later, Means shows Black two sets of DNA test results‚Äîone from McKenna, the other from the Shroud of Turin. The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ; Means entrusts them, and the decision as to whether to proliferate them, to Black. Production Reindl and Maher researched Mary Magdalene (1640 depiction pictured) in writing the episode. \\"Anamnesis\\" is the third episode of Millennium to have been written by Kay Reindl and Erin Maher; the pair had penned two earlier instalments of the second season, and would return for another in the third season. The episode marks the only directorial contribution to the series by producer John Peter Kousakis. Reindl and Maher researched early Christianity while writing the episode, learning that the traditional depiction of Mary Magdalene as a prostitute was probably an incorrect interpretation added later. Maher felt that Magdalene and early Christian priestesses were \\"pretty much weeded out of the Bible\\" over time, and wanted to explore the reasons why female religious figures may have been seen as threatening. The writers faced difficulty from the network's standards and practices office, who had taken exception to the depiction of Jesus Christ as having had a family. The pair also compared the writing of the episode to Millennium sister show The X-Files, believing that the dynamic between Means and Black echoed that of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully on the latter programme, with one character a believer in the supernatural and the other a sceptic. The episode's opening scene makes use of the song \\"Dancing Barefoot\\" by Patti Smith. Broadcast and reception \\"Anamnesis\\" was first broadcast on the Fox network on April 17, 1998. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.3 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately households, and left the episode the eightieth most-viewed broadcast that week. The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode a \\"B\\", finding the character of Catherine Black to have been one of its downfalls. VanDerWerff also criticised the holy blood plot line, comparing it to other contemporary takes on the idea such as the computer game Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned. However, VanDerWerff felt that Cloke and Gallagher worked well on screen together. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3 out of 5, finding it to be \\"out of step, both with the series and the times\\". Gibron also felt that the characters of Black and Means were not strong enough to hold an episode together as lead roles. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"Anamnesis\\" one-and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman felt the episode suffered from having set up an interesting and emotive cold open, which he saw as a red herring to the episode's mystical, theological focus. He was also critical of using Means and Black as the episode's lead roles, finding that the lack of Henriksen's character detracted from the episode.

It premiered on the Fox network on April 24, 1998. The episode was written by Ken Horton, and directed by Thomas J. Wright. \\"A Room With No View\\" featured an appearance by recurring guest star Sarah-Jane Redmond. Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) learns that a figure from his past has been abducting students, seemingly in an attempt to quash their hopes and aspirations. The episode was Horton's first script for the series, and saw the return of villain Lucy Butler (Redmond), who appeared sporadically throughout the series. \\"A Room With No View\\" received positive feedback from television critics, and was viewed by approximately 4.7 million households in its initial broadcast. Plot A young man tunnels out of a farmhouse in Oregon City, Oregon, escaping into the night. He finds an abandoned car and attempts to hot-wire it; someone inside starts the engine and runs him off the road, injuring his ankle. A woman, face obscured, and her male accomplice exit the car and throw the man into its trunk. In Seattle, two friends argue about applying for college. Landon Bryce (Christopher Kennedy Masterson) tells his friend Howard Gordon (Michael R. Coleman) to apply, but Gordon has been convinced by school counselor Teresa Roe (Mariangela Pino) that his progress is too mediocre to make it worthwhile. Bryce accosts Roe, calling her a failure. That night, Gordon is killed, and Bryce is kidnapped. Millennium Group criminal profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) learns that Gordon died of a heart attack, which the coroner believes was caused by fear. Black visits the crime scene, and sees visions of Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), a woman who killed his friend and colleague Bob Bletcher (in season one's Lamentation). Meanwhile, Bryce is bound and gagged in a remote farmhouse, then left in a room with the would-be escapee. The woman from earlier tells Bryce she loves him. Black speaks to fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) about his Butler vision. Watts informs Black that a Group member, Olson, has been tasked with monitoring Butler since her release. Watts and Black travel to Butler's last known address and find Olson's long-dead body. They realize Butler had been filing her own surveillance reports in Olson's name. Meanwhile, Bryce attempts to escape, but is subdued and later comforted by Lucy Butler. Black interviews Roe, suspecting her involvement when she continually refers to Bryce in the past tense. He later discovers that in every school she has worked for, students have been kidnapped; all the victims resembled Bryce in being average students who showed signs of promise. Bryce learns about the tunnel from his cellmate, and the two escape again. Emerging from the tunnel, they are met by Butler and a dog that attacks Bryce. After being brought back to the farmhouse, Bryce is told to accept that he is mediocre and ordinary. Elsewhere, Black and Watts interview Roe again, who seems to espouse the same mindset. Black reveals that he knows Roe was once a promising student, and accuses her of being cowed by a fear of failure. Frightened, she reveals the location of Butler's farm. Police raid the farm, freeing several captive youths, including Bryce, but Butler is nowhere to be found. Production \\"A Room With No View\\" was directed by Thomas J. Wright, who helmed a total of twenty-six episodes across all three seasons. Wright would also go on to direct \\"Millennium\\", the series' crossover episode with its sister show The X-Files. \\"A Room With No View\\" was the first to have been written by producer Ken Horton, and his only solo writing credit. Horton would pen a further two episodes in the third season, both with Chip Johannessen. \\"A Room With No View\\" saw the third appearance of recurring villain Lucy Butler, who had previously appeared in \\"Lamentation\\" and \\"Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions\\", and would return for the third season episodes \\"Antipas\\" and \\"Saturn Dreaming of Mercury\\". Redmond, a fan of series creator Chris Carter and recurring series director David Nutter, had initially auditioned for another episode of the first season which would have been directed by Nutter. Redmond did not get the part she auditioned for but was instead contacted about portraying a minor recurring role instead, which led to her casting as Butler. The episode features the repeated use of the song \\"Love Is Blue\\", performed by Paul Mauriat. Broadcast and reception \\"A Room With No View\\" was first broadcast on the Fox network on April 24, 1998. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 4.8 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately households, and left the episode the eighty-second most-viewed broadcast that week. The episode has received positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an \\"A\\", finding it to be a particularly well-executed version of kidnapping trope in crime thrillers. Handlen also praised the development of the Lucy Butler character, feeling positively that her scenes did not seem like \\"rote horror\\" but made use of clear motives and characterization. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, praising the dialogue and the use of \\"Love Is Blue\\". However, Gibron felt that the episode did little to move the series along, not exploring any of the season's themes or mythology. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"A Room With No View\\" five stars out of five. Shearman felt the episode was the season's most frightening installment, as it dispensed with the wider theological trappings that he felt lessened the impact of other episodes. He also praised the decision to bring back Redmond as Lucy Butler, finding the character to be a good balance between the different depictions of evil depicted throughout the series.

It premiered on the Fox network on May 1, 1998. The episode was written and directed by Darin Morgan, and featured guest appearances by Bill Macy, Dick Bakalyan and Alex Diakun. In this episode, a group of demons convene in a doughnut shop to share stories of tempting and damning humans. However, their stories all seem to include one mysterious figure who can see them for who they really are‚ÄîFrank Black (Lance Henriksen). \\"Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me\\" marks Morgan's second and last script for the series, and parodies his earlier difficulties writing for The X-Files. The episode has received mixed to positive reviews, and earned Morgan a Bram Stoker Award for Best Screenplay nomination in 1999. Plot Four elderly men meet for coffee late at night. The fourth to arrive is hostile to the waiter, who secretly urinates in the man's coffee. The man, Abum (Dick Bakalyan), realizes this, and the group share a laugh over it, during which they are revealed to actually be demons. One of them, Blurk (Bill Macy), complains that there are no strong personalities in this century. He tells a story of Perry, a man he met hitch- hiking, who he molded into a serial killer over encouraging conversations. Perry sought to emulate Johnny Mack Potter, the country's most prolific killer, and to break his record number of murders. As Perry drew level with Potter's figure, Blurk grew bored accompanying him on the \\"mundane\\" murders of prostitutes and vagrants. Blurk gave an anonymous tip to the police that leads to Perry's arrest; one of the men present at the arrest‚Äîoffender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen)‚Äîseems to see through Blurk's human disguise. In prison, Perry is murdered by his cellmate Johnny Mack Potter, reclaiming his record. Abum tells another story, which he believes shows that mankind no longer needs demonic temptation to be damned. Abum followed an everyman figure called Brock, watching his grindingly repetitive life. Brock visited a strip club often but without joy, which led Abum to believe he no longer took pleasure from sinning. One day, Abum added an additional irritation to Brock's life, posing as a traffic warden and giving him a ticket. This was enough to drive Brock to suicide. However, during this time, Abum also encountered Black, who again saw his demonic nature. Greb (Alex Diakun) shares his tale, of a television censor called Waylon Figgleif. Figgleif's overzealous approach to censorship leads Greb to try pushing his limits. Greb assumed the form of a small demonic baby and reveals himself to Figgleif, who breaks down and starts attempting to censor everyday life. Greb repeats this trick, and encourages Figgleif to go on a killing spree‚ÄîFiggleif takes a gun, bursts onto the taping of a science-fiction show about alien abduction, and kills several actors. Greb's methods and effectiveness are dismissed until he reveals the story's epigram. Figgleif's spree was caught on camera, and broadcast by another network as a found footage special. However, Greb also notes that he too was spotted by Black during this. The fourth devil, Toby (Wally Dalton), is convinced that Black really does know that they are demons. Toby also recounts his story, in which he begins to feel ennui at his failure to damn humans for some time. He meets and courts an aging stripper, Sally, who falls in love with him. Their relationship blossomed, despite her having seen his true demonic form. One day Toby leads her to believe he is about to propose to her, before instead curtly insulting and breaking up with her. He later visited her home to find police investigating her suicide‚Äîa successful damnation. However, he also encounters Black, who sees his true nature. Instead of recoiling or reacting, Black simply tells Toby that he sees how lonely he must be. Toby's story affects all the gathered demons, who realize how lonely they really are. As they get up to leave, Abum praises the shop's coffee and briefly reveals his true form to the waiter. Production \\"Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me\\" is the second, and last, episode of Millennium to have been written by Darin Morgan, who also directed the episode. Morgan had previously written and directed \\"Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense\\" earlier in the season. Morgan also served as a consulting producer for the season, and is the younger brother of Glen Morgan, an executive producer for the series. Morgan's script contains several references to his time as a writer for Millennium sister show, The X-Files. One of Morgan's episodes for that series, \\"War of the Coprophages\\", had come under heavy criticism by the standards and practices department at parent network Fox, who took exception to the initial script's heavy use of words such as \\"crap\\" to refer to the excrement that episode's cockroaches fed upon. Morgan attacked and parodied this approach with one of the tales in \\"Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me\\", with a network censor again targeting the use of the word \\"crap\\" and storming onto the set of a show resembling The X-Files being taped, featuring lookalikes of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully with theme music very similar to that series' playing in the background. The episode also contains a version of the dancing baby animation that was popular at the time, parodying its use on the series Ally McBeal. Guest star Alex Diakun had previously appeared in the first season episode \\"Lamentation\\" in an unrelated role; while Dan Zukovic, who played network censor Waylon Figgleif, had also appeared in a small role in \\"Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense\\". Broadcast and reception \\"Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me\\" was first broadcast on the Fox network on May 1, 1998. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.7 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately households, and left the episode the eightieth most-viewed broadcast that week. Morgan's script for the episode earned him a Bram Stoker Award nomination in 1999, for Best Screenplay; the award was won jointly by Bill Condon for Gods and Monsters and Alex Proyas, David S. Goyer and Lem Dobbs for Dark City. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, calling it \\"maybe the best hour of television Millennium ever produced\\". Handlen felt that the episode's \\"disarmingly simple\\" premise belied its depth, and praised Morgan's script as perhaps the writer's best work. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, calling it \\"a very fun, very irreverent respite for the series\\". Gibron felt positively about the episode's dialogue and humor, and praised it for its self-parodying elements. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me\\" two stars out of five, finding that it fit poorly with the tone of the series. Shearman felt that the episode was \\"self-indulgent and irrelevant at worst, and at best only sporadically funny\\".

History Spofforth Castle was built by Henry de Percy in the early 14th century when he was given a licence to crenellate a manor house on the site, with later alterations made in the 14th and 15th centuries.Pettifer, p. 309. The hall-tower of the castle is all that remains of the ruins. The eastern wall of the hall was built largely upon rock foundations. The extant 13th century structure consist of a ground floor undercroft, which has a rock face forming its eastern wall due to its elevation. Two staircases remain on the eastern wall, cut into the rock which lead to the lobby area of the hall. There is a two-storey chamber section on the north side of the tower which has a polygonal stair turret to its northwest corner. The upper storey is of 15th century construction, and is probably a restoration. The Percy estates, including Spofforth, were confiscated after the rebellion against King Henry IV in 1408 and given to Sir Thomas Rokeby. They were later restored and then lost again in 1461 when the Percys supported the losing side in the War of the Roses. Spofforth was eventually returned to the family and remained inhabited by their steward until 1604. The castle was reduced to ruins during the English Civil War of 1642‚Äì1646. The castle was given to the Office of Works in 1924 by the Baron Leconfield. The ruins, primarily the west side of the original castle, are now listed as a grade II* listed building and under the guardianship of English Heritage as a tourist attraction. They are managed by Spofforth-with-Stockeld Parish Council.

Lindsay Planer [ All Music Guide] The New Thing Shortly after Other Planes of There had been recorded, the painter/musician Bill Dixon and the filmmaker Peter Sabino started to present concerts at the Cellar Cafe, a coffeehouse on West 91st Street, New York. They booked Sun Ra on 15 June, who turned up with a 15 piece Arkestra featuring Pharoah Sanders (replacing an errant Gilmore) and Black Harold. The crowd that turned up for this concert, and one for Archie Shepp, persuaded the promoters to instigate a four night festival of the 'New Thing', which would later become defined as Free Jazz. Without advertising - or electricity - Dixon organised over 40 musical acts, including John Tchicai, Cecil Taylor, Roswell Rudd and Jimmy Giuffre. Whilst there were no mainstream reviews, word slowly spread that Jazz had 'announced the arrival of its modernism.' John F Szwed, Space Is The Place, Mojo 2000, p205 Sun Ra himself always distanced the Arkestra from Free Jazz - \\"My music is the music of precision. I know exactly the rhythm that must animate my music, and only this rhythm is valid, I have in my mind a complete image of my work...Sun Ra, quoted in Space Is The Place, Szwed, Mojo 2000, p235\\" - but benefitted enormously from the new interest these concerts generated. As well as being among the first to join the resulting Jazz Composers Guild, (a cooperative aiming to bring the new music to the public), the arkestra continued to play increasingly high-profile concerts throughout the winter of 1964. One of these, with the John Tchicai- Roswell Rudd Quartet, New Year's Eve 1964, was reviewed for the Nation; > 'They present a reviewer with a difficult problem, how to render a > sympathetic appraisal for what was one of the more exciting series without > making this group seem either utterly insane or sickeningly corny?...

The zone is served by the metro station Bellecour of the line A and the buses 91 and 99. History The street was named after a barracks of royal archers. Indeed, the company of archers had its headquarters in a building in the Cour des Archers. The last vestige of that courtyard is a small vaulted alley located at 10 rue de Confort. The H√¥tel des Archers has a modern facade. The Jacobin monks occupied the location from the 13th century and were dislodged during the French Revolution. The prefecture was established in the street in 1818 and remained here until 1852. The street was created in the mid-19th century and has never been modified since its opening on the Place des Jacobins. In 1827, there were 41 looms. The section between rue √âmile-Zola and the Place des C√©lestins was called Passage Couderc as tribute to a deputy of the Rh√¥ne, and was abolished in 1873. Five years later, this section was incorporated to the rue des Archers. In 1923, there were 19 numbers of buildings. The number 3 was built by Henry Feuga, then bequeathed to the Hospices. The numbers 9 and 10 were built under the direction of Casimir Echenier. On 13 August 1829, several five-floor houses were destroyed by a fire and the mayor gave 18,000 francs to the disaster-strickens. Necker studied the market principles in this street.

Superflex describe their projects as Tools, as proposals that invite people to participate in and communicate the development of experimental models that alter the economic production conditions. Often the projects are assisted by experts who bring in their special interest, these tools can then be further used and modified by their users. Often their projects are related to economic forces, democratic production conditions and self-organisation. Superflex has examined alternative energy production methods (Supergashttp://www.supergas.dk) and commodity production in Brazil, Thailand and Europe in their projects, which both expose and question the existing economic structures. These artistic activities ‚Äî as, for example, the ongoing project Guaran√° Power,http://www.guaranapower.org in which the artists developed a drink together with local farmers who cultivate the caffeine-rich berries of the guarana plant ‚Äî are not necessarily opposed to commercialism and globalisation, but try instead to render economic structures visible and to establish a new balance. Through their projects engaging with alternative models for the creation, dissemination and maintenance of social and economic organisation ‚Äì such as Copyshop,http://www.copy-shop.org Guaran√° Power, Rebranding Denmark and Free Beer ‚Äì Superflex has become involved in legal disputes, as well as suffered prohibition orders and police raids, relating to their artistic use of commercial signs and symbols. However, finding that the restrictions placed on their work sometimes led to unexpectedly interesting results, Superflex began to explore the productive potential of prohibition and conceived a series of projects structured to impose regulations on others. Superflex has gained international recognition for their projects. They have had solo exhibitions, among others, at the Kunsthalle Basel in Switzerland (Supershow ‚Äî more than a show), GFZK in Leipzig, Germany (Social Pudding in collaboration with Rirkrit Tiravanija), Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt am Main (Open market), the REDCAT Gallery in Los Angeles (Guarana Power), Mori Museum in Tokyo, Gallery 1301PE in Los Angeles and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Superflex has participated in international arts biennials such as the Gwangju biennial in Korea, Istanbul Biennial, S√£o Paulo Biennial, Shanghai Biennial and in the \\"Utopia Station\\" exhibition at the Venice Biennale. They contributed to the exhibition Rethink Kakotopia shown at the Nikolaj Centre of Contemporary Art in Copenhagen 2009 and at Tensta Konsthall 2010.

While the red square designates the modern, urban life with caf√©, music and sports, the black market is the classic square with fountain and benches. The green park is a park for picnics, sports and walking the dog. The people living in the vicinity of the park are of more than 50 nationalities. Instead of using the designated city objects/furnitures used for parks and public spaces, people from the area were asked to nominate city objects such as benches, bins, trees, playgrounds, manhole covers and signage from other countries. These objects were chosen from a country of the inhabitant‚Äôs national origin or from somewhere else encountered through traveling. The objects were produced in a 1:1 copy or bought and transported to the site. Five groups traveled to Palestine, Spain, Thailand, Texas and Jamaica in order to acquire five objects. The objects have been installed throughout the park. The park has more than 100 objects from than 50 countries. Commissioned by the City of Copenhagen and Realdania, the concept for Superkilen was developed by Superflex in collaboration with architectural firms Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) and Topotek1. =Power Toilets= Power Toilets is a permanent public art work erected on a beach in the recreation area Park van Luna in Heerhugowaard, The Netherlands. The interior of the lavatory building is a copy of the toilets used by the members of the United Nations Security Council in the UN headquarters in New York City, identical in detail to that of the sanitary facilities at one of the most secure buildings in the world. Typical for the 1950s corporate style the design includes marble, big mirrors, stainless steel, yellow ceramic tiles, grey anthracite mosaic floor tiles and American Standard appliances. Power Toilets was designed in collaboration with Nezu Aymo architects. Originally commissioned by DRFTWD office associates for the municipality of Heerhugowaard in 2004, it was accomplished in 2010 with support from the province of Noord- Holland and SKOR, Foundation Art and Public Space. Contractors: Bouwbedrijf Gerrits and Sinnige b.v. and Sculpfiction.

It deals with all complaints from passengers using any Transport for London modes including some cycling and pedestrian issues, Victoria coach station (but not coaches or coach journeys), passengers using Eurostar (but not Eurotunnel), the Heathrow Express rail service to Heathrow Airport and some aspects of rail travel including issues arising from the stations. It also deals with all rail complaints that are outside of the scope of the rail ombudsman and within its geographical remit. It is therefore in consumer representation terms an \\"appeals body\\". It is funded by the London Assembly and was established in its current form in July 2000. History The origins of London TravelWatch can be traced back over 60 years to the time of nationalisation of parts of the public transport network under the postwar Labour Government. The creation of the state-owned British Transport Commission in 1947 was accompanied by a system for national and regional advisory committees set up to represent the public interest. London was represented by the \\"Transport Users Consultative Committee for London\\", which had a duty to consider and make recommendations relating to matters brought to its notice by users, transport providers, or which it considered merited investigation. This responsibility has remained broadly unaltered and is part of TravelWatch's statutory remit today. What has changed is the extent of the body's geographical and modal remit; responsibility for its appointment and remuneration; and on several occasions, its name. These changes were due to changes in both the way transport was run and the way London was governed. By the 1970s a \\"London Transport Passengers Committee\\" existed, appointed and paid for by the Greater London Council (GLC). It represented passengers of London Transport services but not those of the railways (still nationalised at that time). Rail passengers had separate representation by a rail users regional committee, part of a national network of rail users' committees. When the GLC was abolished in 1986, the \\"London Transport Passengers Committee\\" became the \\"London Regional Passengers Committee\\". Its remit was extended to British Rail passengers in and around London, so in effect it absorbed the rail users' regional committee for London. When the Greater London Authority was established in 2000 it was renamed again, this time as the \\"London Transport Users Committee\\", which remains its legal name, and had its remit extended again to cover all activities of Transport for London, other than freight. In practice this included parts of the road network, so car users became part of its responsibility: there is also a duty to take particular account of the needs of pedestrians and cyclists. In 2005 LTUC adopted the operating name \\"London TravelWatch\\". Remit London TravelWatch's remit covers all services provided by Transport for London, including the London Underground, London Buses, the Docklands Light Railway, Tramlink, Dial-a-Ride services, London River Services and the Woolwich Ferry, taxis and private hire cars, Barclays Cycle Hire, and services operated by National Rail train operating companies starting or ending in London that are outside of the scope of the rail ombudsman and within our geographical remit, the Heathrow Express and Eurostar. The geographical area of the rail remit extends far beyond the boundaries of Greater London itself, and includes sizeable areas in the counties of Essex, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Surrey and Kent from where passengers travel into London for work and leisure purposes. This means that over half of all rail journeys within Great Britain relate to the area covered by London TravelWatch. As Transport Focus is responsible for rail outside London this produces an overlap in jurisdiction. However, in practice this relates to a small number of cases as most rail passengers who make a complaint have a clear enough idea as to whether it is, in common sense terms, a London train or not. Any ambiguity as to which consumer body should be involved in a particular case is dealt with by liaison between the two bodies with the workload associated with these processes not being significant. On policy matters the two bodies co operate when required. The role of London TravelWatch is to: *investigate suggestions and complaints from users who are dissatisfied with the response received from the service provider; *conduct independent research and produce publications on issues affecting transport users *maintain a regular dialogue with operators; *assess the impact and make recommendations if proposals are made for the closure of a railway line or a station. Board The full complement of the London TravelWatch Board is a chair plus six ordinary members. appointed for a four- year term by the London Assembly. Members of the London Assembly may not be appointed to the Board; but London Borough Councillors may be. Vacancies are advertised when they arise, and the appointments are made from amongst applicants by the GLA according to the rules governing public appointments that are to be made on the basis of merit. Arthur Leathley was appointed to replace Stephen Locke as Chair in October 2017. Arthur Leathley was also appointed by the GLA to sit on the Board of Transport Focus (previously Passenger Focus) to represent London in national rail matters and to facilitate coordination between the two bodies. Recent history In March 2010 the London Assembly authorised a review into the future of London TravelWatch, undertaken by the Business and Management Committee. The Committee was empowered to examine the effectiveness of London TravelWatch as an advocate body for transport users. As part of this process, user groups across London alongside elected representatives made submissions to the Committee. In September 2010 the Committee published its findings, chiefly to recommend London TravelWatch be abolished. This was the only option put forward by the GLA for the future of transport user representation in London. (Other options that could have been considered, but were not, were to either merge London TravelWatch completely with Transport Passenger Focus (now Transport Focus), or to leave TravelWatch as a stand-alone body, but with reduced functions.) The Committee argued there was too much duplication between London TravelWatch and the national watchdog Passenger Focus that the cost of London TravelWatch was too great, and that transport users' interests would be better represented by elected politicians rather than a board composed of residents of the London TravelWatch area appointed after open competition on the basis of merit. It was proposed that rail matters in London, including complaints, be handled by Passenger Focus. For other transport modes the complaints (appeals) function was to be transferred to a complaints unit which would be part of the London Assembly. The remaining functions of the Board (which would cease to exist) would be carried out by the elected members of the Transport Committee. However the implementation of the Assembly's decision which was opposed by London TravelWatch, required legislation by Parliament, as London TravelWatch has a statutory basis separate from the GLA. Accordingly, the Assembly requested that the Government introduce legislation to give effect to its wishes. The appropriate vehicle for any change would have been the Localism Act but the Minister declined to include any alteration in the status of London TravelWatch in that Bill when it originated in the House of Commons. A further complication was the decision by central government to sharply reduce the funding of Passenger Focus, which would have made any transfer of further functions to that body problematic. When the Localism Bill was before the House of Lords an amendment was proposed at committee stage by two Liberal Democrat peers, which if passed would have transferred the functions of the London TravelWatch Board to the GLA transport committee. The amendment due to timetabling issues, could not be taken until the report stage but was debated on the evening of 12 September 2011. In the event the amendment was withdrawn without a vote having neither Government support nor being without criticism from a number of Peers. (The Bill received Royal Assent as the Localism Act on 15 November 2011). There are no other plans known for legislation to alter the status of London TravelWatch.

The play was first published in Moscow in 1931 and was first published in an English translation in 1933; see Ermolaev (1997, 29) and Ivanov (1983). Based on his 1922 novel of the same name, it was the first play that he wrote and remains his most important.Banham (1998, 552), B√©d√© and Edgerton (1980, 396), and Hartnoll (1983, 430). His novel was first translated into English in 1933; see Cockrell (1998b, 409). In creating his adaptation, Ivanov transformed the passive protagonist of his novel into an active exponent of proletarian ideals; the play charts his journey from political indifference to Bolshevik heroism.Banham (1998, 552), B√©d√© and Edgerton (1980, 396), and Benedetti (1999, 310). Set in Eastern Siberia during the Civil War, it dramatises the capture of ammunition from a counter-revolutionary armoured train by a group of partisans led by a peasant farmer, Nikolai Vershinin.Banham (1998, 552), Benedetti (1999, 310), and Hartnoll (1983, 430, 449). It is a four-act play in eight scenes that features almost 50 characters; crowd scenes form a prominent part of its episodic dramatic structure.Bradby and McCormick (1978, 56) and Rudnitsky (1988, 188). Near the end of the play a Chinese revolutionary, Hsing Ping-wu, lies down on the railway tracks to force the armoured train to stop.Rayfield (2000, 246). Characters * Nikolai Vershinin, a peasant * Peklevanov, Bolshevik party organiser * Hsing Ping-wu, Chinese revolutionary * Vaska Okorok * Nezelasov, White commander of the armoured train * Nadezhda Lvovna, a refugee White Guard Production history Armoured Train 14‚Äì69 was first performed by the world- famous Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) in a production that opened with a gala performance on 8 November 1927.Benedetti (1999, 313, 388) and Hartnoll (1983, 430). It was commissioned to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution.Banham (1998, 552). The production was directed by Constantin Stanislavski, Ilya Sudakov and Nina Litovtseva (of 76 rehearsal sessions, Stanislavski directed 11, though the staging as performed was principally his).Benedetti (1999, 310‚Äì313). The lead role of Vershinin was played by Vasili Kachalov (in his first role as a peasant), while Olga Knipper played Nadezhda Lvovna, Nikolai Batalov played Vaska Okorok, and Nikolai Khmelev played Peklevanov.Hartnoll (1983, 449), Leach (2004, 42), Rudnitsky (1988, 188‚Äì189), and Solovyova (1999, 347). Of the staging of the crowd scenes, the playwright observed during rehearsals that the MAT actors \\"want to and can portray the mass and at the same time distinguish each individual within this mass.\\"In Sovremennyi teatr 7 (1929): 111; quoted by Rudnitsky (1988, 189). Viktor Simov created the scenic design, after Stanislavski rejected the initial sketches of Leonid Chupiatov.Benedetti (1999, 310‚Äì311) and Leach (2004, 42). It was the first successful Soviet play that the theatre presented.Banham (1998, 552) and Hartnoll (1983, 430). In the history of theatre, the MAT production of Armoured Train 14‚Äì69 has been seen as a turning point, heralding the new form of Socialist realism that would soon dominate dramatic production in the Soviet Union.Bradby and McCormick (1978, 56‚Äì57) and Russell (1988, 57). At the same time that the MAT performed the play in Moscow, another production opened at the State Academic Theatre of Drama (now the Alexandrinsky Theatre) in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg).Rudnitsky (1988, 189). This production was directed by Nikolai Petrov. Nikolai Simonov played Vershinin, Boris Zhukovsky played Peklevanov, and Illarion Pevtsov played Nezelasov. Armoured Train 14‚Äì69 was performed in (Germany) by the Proletkult Kassel group, which originated from the League for Proletarian Culture organisation.Stourac and McCreery (1986, 91). Opening in January 1928, its production was publicly acclaimed. The play was performed in France a few years later.Bradby and McCormick (1978, 83). L√©on Moussinac's Theatre of International Action (Th√©√¢tre d'Action) staged it at the Bouffes du Nord theatre in Paris, where it opened on 5 November 1932. The production was directed by I. M. Daniel and received favourable reviews in the press. The play became one of the most frequently performed of the new Soviet drama and now forms part of the Russian theatrical repertory.Bradby and McCormick (1978, 57) and Hartnoll (1983, 430). Joseph Stalin praised the play as \\"a good piece that has great revolutionary significance\\", adding that \\"its educational significance is indisputable.\\"Clark et al. (2007, 65). Adaptations The playwright Sandro Shanshiashvili wrote a Georgian version of the play, which he called Anzor.Rayfield (2000, 246) and Rudnitsky (1988, 268). He set his version in Dagestan in the Northern Caucasus and made his characters Georgians and Lezghins. The play's hero became a Chechen called Anzor Cherbbizh and Shanshiashvili removed the presence of the White Army from its action. He also changed its ending, substituting a lezginka dance performed by Zaira to select who will sacrifice himself to stop the armoured train. Anzor was first performed in 1928 at the Rustaveli Theatre in Tbilisi in a non-naturalistic production directed by Sandro Akhmeteli, with a constructivist scenic design by Irakli Gamrekeli.Rayfield (2000, 246) and Rudnitsky (1988, 268, 288). Akaki Khorava played Anzor.Rudnitsky (1988, 269). In a review, the poet Simon Chikovani criticised the play for trivialising the revolution. Soviet film director Yakov Protazanov directed a cinematic version of the story, called Tommy, in 1931.See . ReferencesSources * Banham, Martin, ed. 1998. The Cambridge Guide to Theatre.

The total project is expected to cost $100 billion. 50 km off the coast of Kakinada.  CAG audit  The Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) was supposed to relinquish 25% of the total area outside the discoveries in 2004 and 2005, as per the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). However, the entire block was declared as a discovery area and RIL was allowed to retain it. In 2011, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) criticised the Oil Ministry for this decision.

However the enhanced price would be applicable only after compensating the shortfall gas in the previous years for the KG basin fields which are under exploration and production contract by Reliance Industries Ltd.

Bates. The battlefield is a narrow valley in Hot Springs County, Wyoming near the junction of the Big Horn Mountains and the Owl Creek Mountains. Variously called the Bates Battle, the Battle of Young's Point, the Battle of Snake Mountain and the Nowood Battle, the action was part of a campaign by forces under the command of Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan to protect the comparatively sedentary Shoshone under Chief Washakie from raids by their traditional enemies, the Northern Cheyenne, the Sioux and the Northern Arapaho. In June 1874, \\"Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors decided to attack the Wind River Shoshones. As the invaders crossed the Big Horn Mountains, they had a disagreement about the purpose of their trip. Some claimed it was a raid for murder and the spoils of war; others said it was to steal horses. Because of the disagreement, the Arapahoes refused to participate.\\"Moulton, Candy. Roadside History of Wyoming. Missoula, Montana: Mountain Press Publishing Company, 1995. 203. Print. Sheridan ordered Bates to raid the Arapaho camp, reported to comprise between 40 and 112 lodges. On July 1, 1874, Bates set forth leading Company B, 2nd Cavalry with 63 cavalrymen, 20 white and Shoshone scouts under Lieutenant R.H. Young, and a party of 167 Shoshone under Washakie. Bates led thirty cavalrymen and twenty Shoshone against the encampment, occupied by Black Coal's people, at daybreak on July 4. Lt. Young took his scouts around to the other end of the village. Fighting went well at first for Bates' force, but the Arapaho moved to a nearby height and began to fire down onto Bates' raiders. Bates withdrew from the village without recovering his own dead., suffering four killed and five or six wounded, while reporting 25 Arapaho killed and 100 wounded. Other reports indicate the Arapaho suffered as few as ten casualties. Bates captured 350 horses of the 1200 to 1400 head associated with the village. Bates blamed his lack of overall success on the noise made by the Shoshone. Accounts of the battle by different parties reveal wide discrepancies in perceptions of the motivation, progress, and outcome of the fight.

Panapasa Balekana co-wrote the anthem's lyrics with his wife while he composed the accompanying music. The anthem was adopted by the country upon its independence in 1978 following a government competition. Biography Balekana was originally from Kandavu, Fiji. He moved to the Solomon Islands in 1953 to work as a mechanic for the government, which was under British colonial administration at the time. He was unmarried when he first moved to the Solomon Islands. He eventually married a Fijian woman, Matila Balekana and resided in the Solomon Islands for most of his adult life. The couple had two children, a son and a daughter. Balekana \\"fell in love\\" with the Solomon Islands and decided to stay in the country rather than return to Fiji. On many occasions, Balekana publicly called the Solomon Islands \\"my home\\". Balekana and his family joined the Wesley United Church in Honiara. He remained heavily involved with the congregation, serving as a church pastor and choirmaster. National anthem In the run-up to independence on 7 July 1978, the government of the Solomon Islands decided that it needed a national anthem for the occasion. The government announced on the radio that it would accept submissions from the general public for a new anthem. Panapasa Balekana and his wife, Matila Balekana, decided to jointly enter the competition as a team. The couple agreed that the new anthem should be in the form of a prayer, asking God to support and guide the new island nation. Balekana claimed in interviews to have received his inspiration for the anthem in a dream. After he woke up from the dream, Balekana and his wife immediately began writing words and lyrics, as well as composing the tune. Panapasa and Matila Balekana co-wrote the lyrics for the anthem, while Panapasa Balekana composed the accompanying music. The couple credited prayer and God for their success in creating the anthem, noting how well the song came together. Once the lyrics and music had been composed, Panapasa and Matila Balekana received help recording the prospective anthem from the Wesley United Church choir at the couple's own congregation. The choir sang the song for the first time, which was recorded on tape and submitted to competition officials. The Balekanas' submission, God Save Our Solomon Islands, won the competition, and became the national anthem of the Solomon Islands. It was sung on the country's first independence day, 7 July 1978. Balekana was overjoyed and explained the importance of the anthem and its meaning, \\"Solomon Islands national anthem was written in a form of prayer asking God for safekeeping and protection of our new nation. By the power and grace of God, we may receive joy, peace, progress and prosperity, if only we can be able to work together in harmony. These may be the foundation of building our nation, as we can be rest assured that we will reach our destination- stands forever more.\\" Later life Panapasa Balekana retired from his work as a government mechanic in 1988. Following his retirement he became the manager and director of a Solomon Islander soft drink company, Szetu Enterprise. In 2000, Panapasa was asked by police to leave the country with his family for his own safety due to the ethnic unrest sweeping the Solomon Islands at the time. Panapasa refused to seek refuge from the violence abroad explaining his loyalty to his adopted country, \\"I refused and told them that this is my home and should anything happen, this is where I'm supposed to die, this is the place ‚Äì my home.\\" Panapasa continued to work as the Wesley United Church choir director until he became too weak in his later years. His son took over the position. Death Panapasa Balekana died on 22 January 2009, at his home in Henderson, Solomon Islands, which is located east of the capital city of Honiara. He was 79 years old. He was survived by his wife, daughter, son and five grandchildren. Balekana was given a state funeral by the Solomon Islands. Balekana's body was laid in state in the main chamber of the National Parliament of the Solomon Islands in the morning of 26 January 2009. VIPs were allowed to lay wreaths in honour of Balekana at the Parliament. Diginitaries attending the viewing and funeral included the Governor-General of the Solomon Islands Nathaniel Waena. Governor-General Waena and Lady Waena led the viewing procession. Other leading officials at the viewing, by order of precedence, included Prime Minister Dr. Derek Sikua and his wife, Doris Sikua; Speaker to Parliament Sir Peter Kenilorea his wife, Lady Kenilorea; the Chief Justice Sir Albert Palmer; and the Deputy Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Fred Fono and his wife. Several former Governors-General, cabinet members, opposition leaders, members of parliament, the diplomatic corps, and the Mayor of Honiara Andrew Mua also attended the state viewing and funeral. A procession, which included members of the general public, went from Parliament to the Wesley United Church in Honiara for the funeral in the afternoon. The national anthem, God Save Our Solomon Islands, was performed during the funeral service in Balekana's honour. A police escort brought Balekana's body from the church to the cemetery at Number 3, near the Honiara High School, for burial. Wreaths were laid by the public before the casket was lowered into the gravesite.

Enclosure takes the land out of common use, denying access to non-owners who had previously used it. There were contemporaneous uprisings in Feckenham Forest and Leicester Forest.Sharp, 1988 Riots also took place at Malvern Chase, where enclosure was largely successfully opposed. Riot and breaching enclosures were not the only form of opposition to disafforestation. In many cases, landowners and tenants felt the compensation they were offered was unfair, and they sought to challenge decisions through the legal system. In at least one case, a town council, the Corporation of Leicester, and borough residents took legal action because of the effect on the poorest forest dwellers, who were likely to become a burden on the town's poor relief. The 1626‚Äì1632 riots were followed by further riots at many of the same locations during the English Civil War and the following Interregnum as disafforestation proceeded and continued to be contested. Origins and causes As early as 1608‚Äì1612, King James I of England's minister Robert Cecil investigated the reform of Royal forests, aiming to increase the income due to the Crown. Cecil's investigations led to more intensive working of the Forest of Dean, and higher revenues from wood sold for iron smelting. Lionel Cranfield accelerated the policy in the 1620s with commissions to determine the scale of the Royal estates within forests and negotiate compensation for their sale and enclosure. Charles I of England's decision in 1629 to govern without Parliament meant greater urgency in finding further sources of income which did not require legislation. Sale of Royal lands, especially Royal forests, was an obvious means of raising short term funds. The forests were also increasingly seen as insufficiently productive. However, many people depended on forest lands for income. As forest law had for many years not been enforced except as a means to raise income, land had been encroached and many people were living there without permission. Timber and grazing rights were very important for commoners. The rights to common had been created through custom rather than legal entitlement: forest law itself was extremely harsh. Participants and organisation The participants of the disorders following enclosure tended to be artisans and waged or self-employed labourers. Many were therefore resident within the forest with small holdings, rather than being peasants primarily dependent on agricultural production. In the Forest of Dean, many were miners whose rights to dig for ore were threatened. Contemporaries within government suspected local men of standing, such as the landowning gentry, of being behind the riots, and looked for evidence that they were involved in their organisation. Although the term 'Western Rising' implies an organised effort across the different threatened Royal forests, there is only occasional evidence that the different communities communicated or tried to co-ordinate their activities. Nevertheless, many tactics were shared, including the use of traditional \\"Lady Skimmington\\" costume and parades to show community disapproval and organise action to break down enclosures. In arrest warrants, leaders were often identified as \\"alias Skimmington\\". The Western Rising=Gillingham= The first riots were in Gillingham Forest, Dorset. Commissions headed by Sir James Fullerton were sent in February and May 1625, to work out compensation for freeholders and copyholders in Gillingham and Mere. In order for the settlement to be made legally binding, the Attorney General then brought an action against the tenants in the Court of the Exchequer, which issued the final decree in May 1627, allowing for adjustments to the compensation were made by a commission which finalised arrangements in October. Much of the land was granted to Fullerton in 1625. The terms were renegotiated in 1628 to help him repay debts. Further arrangements were made to ensure these debts were paid from the forest lands in 1630, shortly before his death.Sharp, p57 Riots took place through 1626‚Äì1628. In December 1626, Star Chamber ordered the attachment (arrest) of fourteen men and twelve of their wives. Seven were brought to trial, and four of the men were fined. in 1628, soldiers destroyed some of the new enclosures, presumably incited to do so by the locals. Further trials at Star Chamber took place. Deer were killed and plants to be used in the new enclosures were burnt. Threats were made against the labourers employed by Fullerton to build the enclosures. Messengers from Star Chamber were assaulted and prisoners released.Sharp, p. 58 The Privy Council took the Gillingham riots very seriously, saying that \\"such like rude actions [must] not be tolerated in a well governed state\\".Sharp, p. 63 An attempt to restore order was made in late 1628, when the Sheriff of Dorset was instructed to arrest 100 rioters. Faced with a much larger and well-armed crowd, he retreated. Particular efforts were made by the government to arrest Henry Hoskins, a yeoman, John Phillips, a tanner and John Williams, believing them to be serious ringleaders. However, Sharp concludes that \\"although these men were important as leaders of riots in their home areas, the government's fears were grounded upon little more than unsubstantiated rumors ... these rumors have misled modern historians into ascribing Hoskins, Phillips and Williams larger roles in the Western Rising than they actually played\\".Sharp, p63 Most of the rioters were artisans, including weavers and tailors. Many would have depended on forest reduce, such as tanners, glove makers and carpenters.Sharp, p. 82 They would have been unlikely to be entitled to compensation and so were among the most badly affected by disafforestation. Around 2,400 acres were sold by the Crown, with 750 acres being set aside to compensate tenants and cottagers.Sharp, p. 87 The poor of Mere received little, however. =Forest of Dean= The object of the Crown was not complete disafforestation in the Forest of Dean, as both timber and iron ore could be exploited for the Crown's profit without leasing the lands. During James I and Charles I's reigns, sales of wood for use in iron works were increased. Some land was enclosed in order for ore to be dug. Around 3,000 acres were however granted to \\"courtiers and government officials\\" with the intention that they exploit the lands for grazing, iron and coal mining and charcoal production.Sharp, p. 62 17,000 acres was to be left to be worked by those claiming common land rights. Riots ensued. In March 1631, the enclosures were destroyed. An assembly of 500 men, \\"with two drummers, two coulers and one fife in a warlike and outrageous manner did assemble themselves together armed with gunnes, pokes, halberds and other weapons\\".Affidavit of Robert Bridges, quoted in Sharp, p. 62 They destroyed enclosures granted to Tristram Flower in the Snead, then onto lands granted in 1625 to Sir Edward Villiers, the half brother of Buckingham. Villier's widow Lady Barbara Villiers's agent Robert Bridges was shot at and threatened, iron ore pits filled in and enclosures broken. An effigy of Lady Villier's agent, the \\"odious projector\\" Sir Giles Mompesson was thrown into the pits and buried. In April 1631, 3,000 rioters with banners and drums removed most of the remaining enclosures elsewhere in the forest and attacked houses of the improvers. By the end of the month, all of the 1628 enclosures had been removed. Over the next two years, the rioters attempted to destroy enclosures as they were put back in place.Sharp, p. 62‚Äì63 =Braydon= On 26 July 1626 Sir John Bridgeman, John Essington (keeper of the king's woods in Wiltshire) and others were given a commission to survey the forest and compound (settle) with the local freeholders and copyholders. They reported the following year, but the complex land relationships meant that a further commission in 1629 was needed to ensure compensation would be granted to everyone who was entitled to it. in November 1627, 4,000 acres were granted for 41 years to Phillip Jacobsen, the Crown jeweller, and the London merchant Edward Sewster. They paid ¬£21,000, plus ¬£11,000 as an entry fine, and ¬£10,000 for game and timber and an ironworks licence. A further annual rent of ¬£450 was to be paidSharp, p. 59 They were permitted to enclose the lands and lease them to new tenants. As with Gillingham, the next step was to establish the precise settlement and rights through actions at the Court of Exchequer, which confirmed the settlement in 1628 and 1630. Riots broke out in May‚ÄìJune 1631 when enclosures made by Jacobsen's agent Simon Keble were destroyed. Groups of perhaps over 1,000 rioters also threatened to kill Keble and destroy his workmen's houses. At least one was destroyed, belonging to a servant who had reported some of the rioters to the authorities. When the sheriff and a court official attempted to suppress the riots on behalf of Star Chamber, the crowds shot at them.Sharp, p. 60 Other forest riots As Feckenham, Leicester and Malvern were further afield, disafforestation riots in these places were not classed as part of the Western Rising by contemporaries, but took place at the same time for roughly the same reasons. =Feckenham= Considerable pressure on the wooded areas as the result of the use of timber to fuel salt pans in Droitwich, a practice that had been recorded as far back as the Domesday Book. Demand for salt increased as the population grew. Much of the forest that had therefore been cut was being farmed by the time the forest was abolished in 1629.Humphreys, p128 Sir Miles Fleetwood was charged with surveying the lands before the disafforestation.Large, 407‚Äì408. The response of the inhabitants was to refuse to accept their allocation of common land, on the grounds that they had only agreed to them by \\"for fear and by terrible threats\\" and that their allocations did not compensate them for the loss of common rights.Large, p409. Ultimately 155 of them complained to the Court of Exchequer.Large, 410. Near the end of 1627, William Ashton and William Turnor were let the forest in return for a fine of ¬£4,000 and a nominal annual rent of ¬£20. This was confirmed in June 1629, when the disforestation of the forest was decreed, so that the 2100 acres of woodland and waste in the forest parishes of Hanbury, Feckenham and Bradley could be partitioned between the crown, the manorial lords and the commoners. A further commission in November 1630 reduced the crown's allocation in Hanbury from 550 to 460 acres, but this was still not accepted locally. The new owners were ordered to enclose their lands by 1 March 1631, but on 28 March, a riot took place in which three miles of fencing were thrown down.Large, 412‚Äì413. 300 people rioted the following year and were met by the Sheriff, a deputy lieutenant and a justice of the peace and forty armed men. The rioters \\"in a most daring and presumptuous manner presented themselves unto us with warlike weapons (vizt) pikes, forrest bills, pitchforks, swords and the like\\". On this occasion, the authorities acted to suppress this \\"flatt rebellion\\", tried to arrest the rioters and injured a number.Quoted in Sharp, p. 61 Ultimately, the crown and manorial lords were successful in enclosing their lands.Large, 416. The crown allocation in Hanbury was rapidly sold off.Deeds in Worcestershire Record Office. The Lord of Hanbury and Feckenham manors, Sir Edward Leighton gained around 80 acres in Monkwood and 360 acres around Feckenham.Worcestershire Relics, John Noake, quoted by Humphreys, p. 129 =Leicester= Sir Miles Fleetwood was commissioned to survey and disafforest Leicester in December 1626 and March 1627. Commoners were to receive compensation where they could show a valid claim; many would not be able to, if they had settled of their own accord. The Attorney General then ensured that the arrangements were confirmed by the court of Exchequer in February 1628. The King then let 1,598 acres to nearby landowners for \\"fines\\" of ¬£7,760 and small annual rents. Riots occurred in response, destroying existing enclosures in spring 1627 and again in 1628 following the final division of the lands.Sharp, p. 58‚Äì59 Legal challenges were also made, against both the rioters and the enclosures. The enclosures were challenged by local inhabitants, the Corporation of Leicester and borough residents who submitted petitions to the King and Privy Council. The Privy Council found nothing unjust about the dealings of Fleetwood however, so challenges were made in the House of Lords in June 1628. the Lords however supported Fleetwood. An order was then made by the Lords praising Fleetwood for adding substantial income to the Crown but however to halt Star Chamber proceedings against the rioters. Buchanan Sharp concludes that \\"it may be surmised that a quid pro quo had been worked out: if the forest's inhabitants stopped rioting and petitioning, the government would drop all legal proceedings\\".Sharp, p. 70‚Äì71 Compensation The Crown made considerable compensation to local manorial lords and tenants as well as other residents. Five lords claimed around 2,755 acres were in use by their manors; of these 1,030 went to the King, and the rest to the manorial lords. The landowners had in turn to compensate their tenants for their losses. 554 acres went to tenants according to the size of their holdings, at around 4‚Äì6 acres to the yardland. Around 1.5‚Äì2 acres went to each cottage in addition. The Crown also compensated freeholders in other townships at a similar rate and gave 40 acres to the borough of Leicester for the maintenance of their poor.Sharp, p. 88 However, compensation would not have been made to the many families who had established homes on assart land (i.e., those who were occupying part of the forest without permission). The June 1628 petition to the House of Lords claimed that the families in 100 ancient cottages would not be compensated and neither would many more living in newly built cottages.Sharp, p. 95 =Malvern= In 1630 Charles I granted one-third part of the Forest or Chace of Malvern to Sir Robert Heath, then Attorney-General, and Sir Cornelius Vermuyden. In the meantime many rights or claims of right had arisen by grant or long usages in the lapse of several centuries. When the grantees began to enclose the Chace the commoners and other persons interested disputed their right to do so. Several riots and disturbances took place in consequence. Nevertheless, a decree was issued in 1632 for the \\"disafforestation of the Chace of Malvern, and for freeing the lands within the bounds, limits, and jurisdictions thereof, of and from the game of deer there and the forest laws\\". By this decree (to obviate all disputes) one-third part only was to be severed and divided by commissioners, but the other two parts \\"shall remain and continue unto and amongst the commoners, and be held by them according to their several rights and interests, discharged and freed from his Majesty's game of deer there, and of and from the forest laws, and the liberties and franchises of Forest and Chace, in such sort as by the said decree it doth and may appear\\".Lees, 1877 Further disputes with landowners resulted in clarifications that any land that was disafforested had to be in proportion to the quality of the land as a whole, so that the common was not the most meagre land. Further unrest Further unrest took place during the run up to the Civil War, with episodes continuing to break out until the 1660s. In the Forest of Dean, 22,000 acres were disafforested, with 4,000 going to manorial lords and freeholders in compensation in 1639. 18,000 acres were to go to the Crown, and granted to Sir John Winter. Riots ensured in 1641.Sharp, pp. 140‚Äì142 Winter's claim to the lands was voided by Parliament in March 1642, in part because he had failed to pay. His assets were sequestrated for supporting the Crown during the Civil War. The Protectorate tried to enclose a third of the forest in 1657, leaving two thirds to the Commoners. Although a relatively generous settlement, it caused resistance in April and May 1659, when fences of new enclosures were broken and cattle brought in to graze. Royalists including Edward Massey attempted to bring the discontented to the side of Charles II.Sharp, p163 After the restoration, Sir John Winter successfully reasserted his right to the Forest of Dean. However, in 1668 forest law was reestablished by Act of Parliament. in 1672, the King's ironworks were closed, to reduce pressure on the forest from mining.Sharp, p164 ReferencesSources * P.

History  In the 1980s a co-operative of sports facility managers began the first established network of small-sided football leagues, predominantly in sports halls and, in 1990 these were grouped under a single generic name, Leisure Leagues, to represent a local small-sided football league usually located outside London and in rural or provincial towns across the United Kingdom where the opportunity for low cost competitive sport was limited. thumb In 1998, the Leisure Leagues Allstars was formed to play challenge matches against other 5 a side teams across the country. Leisure Leagues then grew throughout the United Kingdom with the first leagues in the Republic of Ireland beginning in 2007, in the United States of America in 2012 and in Pakistan in 2017. Leisure Leagues is the generic name for multiple organisations operating under either a franchise or licence and is the largest independent network of small-sided leagues globally. Leisure Leagues operates over 70 separate multi-league franchises in the United Kingdom. Charities Leisure Leagues donates its profits to a range of charities, including Cancer Research UK, the Dogs Trust and Blind Children UK. And even with the organisation's massive operations across Europe, they are committed to keeping their travelling carbon neutral. Leisure Leagues Pakistan In 2016, the Leisure Leagues brand launched in Pakistan, with a series of exhibition games involving some of the worlds top footballers, like Ronaldinho and Ryan Giggs , the matches are thought to have attracted the largest crowds ever in the history of 6 a side, and became known as the \\"Ronaldinho and Friends\\" games. Leisure Leagues Mexico In 2019, The brand went to Mexico, launching the first network of leagues in the country. Testimonials The organisation has received words of support from several footballing celebrities, including Alan Wiley, Alex McLeish, Stephen Kelly and Jeff Kenna. It is not only in the footballing world though where the charitable work of Leisure Leagues is recognised, as Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Usain Bolt and Boris Johnson have all given messages of support to the organisation. Format The Leisure Leagues, using football pitches across the country, give the opportunity to people from different walks of life and standards of football to get involved in a local league. These are generally people that have been left behind by the 11-a-aide game, which is more geared to better, fitter footballers. The different leagues in different regions (and days) contain varying numbers of teams and divisions. Teams and players can compete in multiple leagues at the same time and as there are different skill levels throughout the leagues, teams may win one league and find themselves in a relegation battle in another. thumb Number of players As of April 2017 the Leisure Leagues Network had well over 300,000 players, which makes it the biggest independent network of leagues anywhere in the world, with well over 3000 teams playing in competitions in the UK alone. New website On 5 September 2016, Leisure Leagues unveiled its new website. The first league to be tested on it was the Flagship competition at Birmingham University. The roll-out was completed fully on 31 October, with the old website switched off on 1 November 2016.http://retro.leisureleagues.net Leisure Leagues Franchise In 2010, Leisure Leagues unveiled plans to franchise their brand worldwide.

It was the eighth triennial election of the whole Council. The size of the council was 118 councillors and 19 aldermen. The councillors were elected for electoral divisions corresponding to the parliamentary constituencies that had been created by the Representation of the People Act 1884. There were 57 dual member constituencies and one four member constituency. The Council was elected by First Past the Post with each elector having two votes in the dual member seats. National government background The Prime Minister of the day was the Liberal H. H. Asquith who led a minority Liberal Government that relied upon the Irish Parliamentary Party for a majority. A General Election had taken place a couple of months earlier in January at which the Liberals had lost their overall majority. The Conservatives and Liberal Unionists formed the official opposition. The Labour Party was the fourth party and generally voted with the Liberals in parliament. London Council background The Municipal Reform party had been in power since winning a majority in 1907. It was now seeking its second mandate. Candidates All constituencies were contested. The governing Municipal Reform Party ran a full slate of 118 candidates. The opposition Progressive Party ran 110 candidates. They ran candidates everywhere except the City of London where they ran three candidates, Hampstead, St George's Hanover Square and Strand where only one candidate stood, three constituencies where one candidate ran in tandem with Labour and Woolwich where they did not oppose a Labour pair. Four Independents also ran. =Labour Party= The party fielded ten candidates, five of these candidates ran in tandem with Progressive candidates, a further two candidates were not opposed by Progressives. The other three all stood in opposition to Progressive candidates. The Labour Party in London had no elected or otherwise recognised Leader. Outcome The Municipal Reform Party was returned with its second successive majority. At the 1907 elections, they had an overall majority of 40. After that election they shared out the 9 vacant Aldermanic seats giving them an effective working majority of 43. At the 1910 elections, their overall majority was cut to just 2. After the election they decided to bolster their majority by giving themselves all 10 of the vacant Aldermanic seats. This gave them an effective working majority of 17. Two of their new Aldermanic appointments were people who had just been voted out by the electors.

It was the tenth triennial election of the whole Council. The size of the council was increased to 124 councillors and 20 aldermen. The councillors were elected for electoral divisions corresponding to the new parliamentary constituencies that had been created by the Representation of the People Act 1918. There were 60 dual-member constituencies and one four-member constituency. The council was elected by First Past the Post, with each elector having two votes in the dual-member seats. National government background The prime minister of the day was the Liberal David Lloyd George. who had just led a Coalition Government that included the Unionist Party and some Liberals and Socialists to a general election victory three months earlier, with the help of a Coalition government 'coupon'. London Council background Although the Municipal Reform party had won an overall majority at the last elections in 1913, in line with national politics, they decided late in 1917 to form a war- time coalition to mirror the national government. Some Progressive Party members were offered chairmanships of committees. This coalition had continued after the war ended. Candidates There was no County wide electoral agreements between any of the parties, though clearly there had been some locally agreed situations. There were very few constituencies where all three parties stood two candidates. In the past, the Progressive Party had encompassed the Labour Party, with candidates running in harness. That situation was becoming less common. A few Progressive candidates ran in harness with Municipal Reform candidates but there was no 'coupon' in operation for the two 'coalition parties' who frequently ran candidates against each other. Among the defeated candidates were future Labour Leader Clement Attlee and future Conservative Chief Whip David Margesson Outcome The Municipal Reform Party won an overall majority of seats, electing 68 councillors. They only lost one seat, to an Independent candidate. (The defeated candidate was made an Alderman after the election) As before they decided to operate a form of Coalition with the Progressives. Labour made a substantial advance in terms of seats, but remained the third party. There was just one Independent elected. Constituency results=Battersea= *Incumbent Councillors shown in bold.

He was involved in the All India Muslim League. as well as the Khilafat Movement, which contributed to the greater Indian Independence Movement. Early life Qureshi's ancestors migrated from Mecca during the reign of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. He was born in Abbottabad, British India but now part of Pakistan. He was born in Mohallah Munshian ‚Äì a neighbourhood named after his father Munshi Mian Nizam ud din Qureshi (called munshi as he was scholar of Arabic and Persian). After completing his education, Qureshi joined the Public Works Department. In 1914, in response to World War I, Muslim leaders issued a fatwa that working under British government was haram (forbidden), so Qureshi resigned from his government job and started his own business. He started taking part in politics, joining the Freedom Movement. Political career 200px He started his career as a president of the Khilafat Movement in Hazara, Pakistan, and was leading many welfare organizations there, and serving as an honorary magistrate. He was elected member of local municipal committee in 1920 and remained senior vice president of M.C Abbottabad consecutively from 1920 to 1943 till his death on 24 August 1943. In recognition of his services, the local government named the central bazaar and central neighborhood of the city after his name. In Abbottabad there were many Hindu organizations at that time, so Muslims formed many organizations under his leadership. He was an honorary magistrate also and people came to him for their problems. His residence, DARUL QURAISH was central headquarters for Muslims. In 1935 Hindus decided to replace Muslim Eidgah with Ram Mandir. Mian Noor uddin Qureshi along with Maulana Mohd Ishaq (Khateeb e Hazara) opposed Ram Mandir scheme. Under his leadership, a big procession was held, and finally Ram Mandir scheme came to an end. In 1937, he founded All India Muslim League in Hazara District. He invited all leading members of All India Muslim League including Maulana Shaukat Ali (Ali bradaran), Maulana Abdul Hameed Badauni, Nawab Bahadur Yar Jung, Pir Maanki Sharif, Sardar Aurangzeb, for a meeting which was held at his home. Other leaders attending this meeting included Qazi Essa, Nawab Mohd Ismail, Bakht Jamal Khan, Agha syed Lal Badshah, etc. After this meeting a successful Muslim Conference was held in Abbottabad and Jinnah wrote a letter of congratulations to Mian Noor uddin Qureshi and his son Mian Basir uddin Qureshi. This led to rapid succession of Muslim League in NWFP and it won the referendum in 1947 which was not possible without the great efforts of Mian Noor ud din Qureshi in Hazara.

A WiiWare version was released in North America on August 3, 2009 and in Europe on September 25, 2009. It is the first ESRB M-rated game to be released for WiiWare. Overview The objective of the game is for players to win hands in order to remove articles of clothing from their female opponents, which are either portrayed by still photographs or manga-style artwork. Along with 5-card draw or Texas hold 'em poker, players can also compete in video poker and blackjack. The game also features a photo gallery mode. The original game was followed by several sequels including Sexy Poker 2006, Sexy Poker Manga, Sexy Poker Top Models and Sexy Poker Pixel. Compared to the mobile phone versions, the WiiWare version does not feature any nudity. Controversy The WiiWare version of 'Poker' has been refused classification by the Australian Classification Board, with issues raised with the game's use of nudity as an incentive or reward for players, which is prohibited by the Office's current classification guidelines. The game was edited worldwide to remove nudity (whether this was due to problems with its ban in Australia is unknown) and this version of the game didn't even receive a MA15+ rating, but a more lucrative M rating due to sexual references. Reception Nintendo Life called the WiiWare version \\"a letdown for fans of both poker and sexiness\\", citing the bare bones presentation, odd application of rules and lack of multiplayer and replayability. IGN believed that the game will only appeal to adolescents and those who download it as a joke.

Originally constructed as a wooden tower, it was replaced with a stone tower in 1804. This in turn was replaced by a structure on the parapets of Fort Rodman which was deactivated in 1898. After restoration in the early 1970s, it was relit again in 2001 by the city as a private aid. History The first light at this location was erected in 1797 by a group of local merchants, New Bedford at the time being a center of the whaling industry. This tower, constructed of wood, lasted only a year before it was destroyed in a fire; its successor was also privately erected, but was turned over to the federal government in 1800, having been lit the previous year. This tower lasted somewhat longer, apparently destroyed by lightning in 1803. The following year a stone tower was erected; this was rebuilt somewhat in 1818, increasing the height of the tower. Various upgrades to the tower were performed over the years including new lamps and an octagonal lantern. There was no keeper's dwelling at the site until 1842. Starting in 1857, construction on Fort Taber (also known as Fort Rodman) begin adjacent to the lighthouse. The fort became obsolete following the civil war, and construction was finally halted in 1871, though the stone superstructure was essentially complete by the end of the war. The walls were found to obscure the lighthouse beacon from some quarters, and therefore a new lighthouse was built on the fort itself. This was a small wooden structure with the lantern set on its hipped roof. Special swinging frames were provided for the lantern to minimize the risk of damage when the fort's cannons were fired, but these were never put to the test. The old tower was abandoned and was eventually demolished in 1906. By that time the Butler Flats Light had been established next to the shipping channel, and the light on the fort was rendered obsolete; the Clarks Point keeper was transferred to the new light in 1898, and the old light was extinguished. The lantern of the lighthouse is barely visible over the right center of the fort. It remained perched on the fort, however, and in the early 1970s it was restored along with the remains of the fort. Nonetheless it was badly damaged by vandals. In the late 1990s the city restored the area around the fort as a park, and in 2001 the lighthouse was rebuilt and relit, along with two other lighthouses. It continues in operation as a private aid to navigation.

Based on an original scenario by Feyder and Charles Spaak, it is a psychological drama set largely in a small hotel on the C√¥te d'Azur, and it provided Fran√ßoise Rosay with one of the most substantial acting roles of her career. It was produced by the French subsidiary of the German company Tobis Film. Plot 1924\\\\. Louise Noblet keeps a small hotel, the Pension Mimosas, on the C√¥te d'Azur in the south of France, with her husband Gaston who is also a supervisor in local casino. Many of their clientele are luckless gamblers hoping for success in the local casino. Childless themselves, Louise and Gaston have been bringing up the young Pierre while his father serves a prison sentence, but they are dismayed when the father is released early and comes to take back his son. 1934\\\\. Pierre, now a young man, is living in Paris among gamblers and gangsters, and he still plays upon the feelings of his former adoptive parents to extract money from them. Louise makes him return to the Pension Mimosas and find a job, but she now develops an ambiguous affection for him. To please him, she even invites his mistress Nelly to join him in the hotel. The two women soon become rivals, while Pierre accumulates debts. Louise reveals Nelly's whereabouts to her old protector who comes to take her back. In despair Pierre kills himself, while Louise has gone to the casino under an assumed identity to win the money to pay his debts. Cast * Fran√ßoise Rosay as Louise Noblet * Paul Bernard as Pierre * Andr√© Alerme as Gaston Noblet * Lise Delamare as Nelly * Arletty as Parasol * Jean-Max as Romani Background Pension Mimosas was the second of three films which Jacques Feyder made in swift succession on his return to France after his unsatisfactory experience in Hollywood. All three films were developed in conjunction with the scenarist Charles Spaak and included major roles for Feyder's wife Fran√ßoise Rosay, but each told a different kind of story and employed a distinctly different style of filming. Whereas Le Grand Jeu (1934) was a fast-moving melodrama with some exotic settings, and the later La Kermesse h√©ro√Øque would be a satirical period farce, Pension Mimosas presented a more measured contemporary drama. Production Filming took place from August to October 1934. The setting of the Pension Mimosas is not specifically identified in the film, but a few exterior shots show the casino at Menton as well as its gardens and swimming pool.Jean A. Gili, \\"Pension Mimosas, ou l'absence de hasard dans le jeu des passions\\", in 1895: revue de l'Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma; num√©ro hors s√©rie, octobre 1998: \\"Jacques Feyder\\". pp.157-166. Apart from a few other exterior shots on the C√¥te d'Azur and some in Paris, most of the film was shot in the studio (at the Tobis studios in √âpinay). Lazare Meerson created a detailed but unobtrusive set which presented the various areas of the hotel as an integrated whole, facilitating the revelations and interactions of the drama. This enclosed setting (though spacious and brightly lit) gives much of the film the feeling of a stage play, a factor which has sometimes been held against it, but it also concentrates attention upon the interplay of character and the actors' performances. Although gambling is continually featured in the background and the activities of the characters, frustrated love is the more central theme of the film. Fran√ßoise Rosay dominates the action in a role which recalls aspects of Racine's Ph√®dre in its exploration of a mother's feelings which are also those of a lover.Georges Sadoul, Dictionnaire des films. (Paris: Seuil, 1983.) p.238. Arletty appears in a small role (one scene only) as a parachutist living on the fringes of bad company in Paris. Marcel Carn√© worked as assistant director on the film. Reception The film was released in Paris in January 1935 with an exclusive run at the Cin√©ma Colis√©e. A contemporary reviewer judged that Pension Mimosas showed the real Jacques Feyder, working by and for himself, creating a powerful and moving story that was also full of delicacy and humour; the characters, which were real and directly presented, owed much to the exceptional quality of the dialogue (by Charles Spaak) and the choice of actors who were able to perform to each other rather than to the camera.Jacques Deval, in Marianne, 30 janvier 1936, quoted in 1895: revue de l'Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma; num√©ro hors s√©rie, octobre 1998: \\"Jacques Feyder\\". p.166. \\"M. Feyder livr√© √† lui-m√™me, √† lui seul, a invent√© une histoire √©mouvante et puissante, toute baign√©e pourtant de tendresse et d'humour: il a cr√©√© des personnages si r√©els, si simples, que leurs peines et leurs joies sont n√¥tres de plain-pied, et, miracle tout particulier, il leur fait parler un langage si juste, si direct, si fr√©missant de vie, que le seul dialogue de Pension Mimosas mettrait ce film hors de pair: miracle plus rare encore, il a su choisir ses interpr√®tes et les faire jouer face √† eux et non √† une cam√©ra.\\" The film's sobriety of style and lack of sensational elements impressed other critics. A contemporary film historian said, \\"One rediscovers [in Feyder]... a simplicity which benefits the often profound revelation of the psychological drama through the performance of the actors...\\".Maurice Bard√®che and Robert Brasillach, Histoire du cin√©ma. (Paris: 1935). Quoted in 1895: revue de l'Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma; num√©ro hors s√©rie, octobre 1998: \\"Jacques Feyder\\". p.237. \\"On retrouve chez lui [Feyder] ...une simplicit√© qui ne sert que mieux la r√©velation souvent profonde, gr√¢ce au jeu des interpr√®tes du drame psychologique, dont les images nous pr√©sentent et nous sugg√®rent le d√©veloppement.\\" This view has been echoed by a more recent critic: \\"Without the more ostentatious virtues of Le Grand Jeu and La Kermesse h√©ro√Øque, Pension Mimosas is a film in intaglio in which Feyder finds a style of classical refinement, free from any pathos... This masterpiece of psychological analysis leaves nothing to chance, either in the precision of the screenplay or in the detail of the set-design or in the controlled performances of the actors.\\"Jean A. Gili, \\"Pension Mimosas, ou l'absence de hasard dans le jeu des passions\\", in 1895: revue de l'Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma; num√©ro hors s√©rie, octobre 1998: \\"Jacques Feyder\\". p.165-166. \\"Sans les m√©rites plus voyants du Grand Jeu ou de la Kermesse h√©ro√Øque, Pension Mimosas est un film en creux dans lequel Feyder trouve une sorte de finesse 'classique' d√©gag√©e de tout pathos... Ce chef-d'oeuvre d'analyse psychologique ne laisse rien au hasard, aussi bien dans la pr√©cision du sc√©nario que dans la minutie des d√©cors ou le jeu contenu des com√©diens.\\" When the film was shown in the United States in 1936, it was significantly cut, and the result did not find favour with the reviewer of the New York Times: \\"...it fails to justify the accolades given it by the foreign press. ...As it emerges now it either has not been edited as severely as it merits, or has been cut too harshly. Its pace is somnolent; certain episodes are extraneous and immaterial, and it suggests it might have had a tragic meaning other than the one it now conveys.\\"Frank S. Nugent, New York Times, 6 May 1936. In later decades, Pension Mimosas has not enjoyed wide circulation in the English-speaking world. What was agreed even by disappointed critics was the remarkable quality of the performance by Fran√ßoise Rosay. \\"Although everything may not be perfect in this film, one can say that the cinema has rarely shown us a human and living character as complex as that portrayed by Fran√ßoise Rosay, with such marvellous intelligence and art.\\"Maurice Bard√®che and Robert Brasillach, Histoire du cin√©ma. (Paris: 1935). Quoted in 1895: revue de l'Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma; num√©ro hors s√©rie, octobre 1998: \\"Jacques Feyder\\". p.237. \\"Bien que tout ne soit pas parait dans ce film, on peut dire que le cin√©ma nous a rarement montr√© un personnage humain et vivant aussi complexe que celui de l'h√©ro√Øne tel que l'incarne Fran√ßoise Rosay, avec une intelligence et un art si merveilleux.\\" Among the many performances that Rosay gave in films directed by her husband, none was more searching or powerful than this one, and Feyder himself, in a dedication that he wrote on a copy of the screenplay, paid tribute to the \\"overwhelming emotion\\" that she brought to the role.Didier Griselain, \\"Fran√ßoise Rosay, Madame Jacques Feyder\\", in 1895: revue de l'Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma; num√©ro hors s√©rie, octobre 1998: \\"Jacques Feyder\\". p.56. \\"√Ä ma Rosay, je d√©die ce film √©crit pour elle avec toute ma ferveur, pour son talent et... qu'elle accueille ma tendre gratitude, pour avoir d√©pass√© mes espoirs, par son interpr√©tation bouleversante d'√©motion.\\" The film's realism was influential upon the developing styles of poetic realism in French cinema (especially upon Marcel Carn√© who acknowledged \\"the invisible presence\\" of Feyder which was always at his side when he went on to direct his own films).Marcel Carn√©, in 1895: revue de l'Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma; num√©ro hors s√©rie, octobre 1998: \\"Jacques Feyder\\". p.176.

It was purchased in 1991 by the Dundee Heritage Trust. The trust restored the buildings, which were officially opened by Prince Charles in 1996, as a museum dedicated to the textile industry, an industry that once dominated the city's economy. Historic building The Verdant Works was given Category A listed building status by Historic Scotland in 1987. This is the highest category for listing in Scotland, denoting a building of national architectural importance. It is a rare surviving example of a courtyard-type mill, with its original building layout and many original features remaining. It is one of a declining number of industrial premises in Dundee and east-central Scotland remaining little-changed from the 19th century. Museum The Verdant Works are the only dedicated jute museum in the United Kingdom. As a museum, the Verdant Works tell the story of Dundee's textile industries, focusing primarily on the jute and linen industries. The production of textiles was the dominant industry in Dundee for many years, directly employing 50,000 people in the city (half the working population) by the end of the 19th century, as well as many more thousands in associated trades such as shipbuilding, transportation, and engineering. At the time Dundee supplied the majority of the world's demand for jute products, meaning it was also of importance for both Scottish and British histories. The jute collections cover the entire history of the jute industry. It covers topics such as manufacturing, research and development, end products, quality control, textile engineering, the industry's Indian connections, and the lives of the workers. Objects include machinery patterns, jute and flax products, small tools, technical drawings, plans, and quality control and testing equipment. The archives and photographic records of various mills and their workers have considerable historical research value. As well as the large machinery objects, the collections cover the fields of industrial history, social history, fine art, archives, business papers, photographs, costumes, and numismatics. Verdant Works is a fully accredited museum and has won numerous awards, both national and international, as well as being a 5-star- rated tourist attraction with Visit Scotland. In 2008, the Jute Collection was named as a Recognised Collection of National Significance. In September 2015, a new section of the museum was opened in the High Mill, after an extensive restoration of this building. The High Mill was built in 1833, and is the oldest part of the complex. The project to conserve the High Mill and convert it into an open gallery was partly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.
