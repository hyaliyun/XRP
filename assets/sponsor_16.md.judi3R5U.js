It became his fourteenth consecutive Top 10 single in 1951.  Background  Jimmie Davis was a Jimmie Rodgers disciple who scored a big hit on Decca Records with \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" in 1939 and \\"There's a New Moon Over My Shoulder\\" in 1945. It is unclear when he and Hank Williams wrote \\"(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle\\"; on one of his Mother's Best radio shows, recorded between January and March 1951, Williams tells his audience that he's going fishing with Jimmie Davis the next week, so the song may have been composed then. Containing two of country music's major themes, trains and prison, the song is notable for the way Hank mimics the sound of a train whistle on the word \\"lonesome.\\" The song was likely an inspiration for Johnny Cash's \\"Folsom Prison Blues.\\" It was recorded at Castle Studio in Nashville on July 25, 1951 with Fred Rose producing and backing from Don Helms (steel guitar), Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Sammy Pruett (lead guitar), Howard Watts (bass) and probably Jack Shook (rhythm guitar). Acuff-Rose songwriter Helen Hudgins later recalled the stiflingly hot summer session: \\"Hank had his shirt unbuttoned all the way, and he was absolutely soaking wet. It seemed that all he was...was voice. It came up from I don't know where.\\" In a June 2014 online Rolling Stone article, Joseph Hudak wrote of the song, \\"The sound is so stark, so unsettling, that it's easy to feel exactly what Williams was getting at in the performance: simple heartbreak.\\" The song's title was truncated to \\"Lonesome Whistle\\" so that it could be listed on jukebox cards. It peaked at number 8 on the Billboard country singles chart. The B-side, Fred Rose's \\"Crazy Heart\\", outperformed it, peaking at number four.

She was discovered through her YouTube channel after uploading acoustic guitar covers of contemporary hits, most notably hip hop songs, that went viral. In 2014, Heaton released her debut single \\"Bad Intentions\\" and an extended play of the same name. The single charted on Billboard and became gold-certified by the RIAA. Heaton embarked on her first headlining concert tour, The Bedroom Tour, in late 2015, and released the similarly titled mixtape, The Bedroom Tour Playlist, on March 18, 2016. The mixtape compiled remastered material she had previously shared online for free streaming and debuted for her live shows during the tour. Her follow-up EP, Starting Over, was released in 2018 through Capitol Records. Early and personal life Nicolet Aleta Logan was born on December 4, 1994, in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in Geneva, Illinois, but she has noted she has a stronger connection to the time she spent in her mother's native South Africa. After writing her first song at age five and teaching herself to play guitar at nine, Heaton dedicated her childhood years to making music. Despite realizing early on that she wanted to be a musician, she never saw herself as a performer and just wanted to make music, developing a stage fright. She gave herself vocal training by singing along to a Diana Ross greatest-hits CD, since her family couldn't financially support her musical education. Heaton has an older brother and also had a sister Rachel, who beat liver cancer but died in 2007 at age 21 while waiting for a second liver transplant, whom she regularly notes taking inspiration from. Heaton also struggled with bullying throughout her school years. She married actor, model, personal trainer and entrepreneur Jeff Logan on July 14, 2019, and gave birth to their first son on May 1, 2020. Career Heaton (right) performing at the El Rey Theatre as part of the Bedroom Tour in 2015 In 2011, while still enrolled in high school, Heaton began uploading clips recorded in her bedroom on YouTube, including covers of contemporary hit songs along with occasional originals, for which she accompanied herself on acoustic guitar. In December 2012, her cover of Chief Keef's \\"Love Sosa\\" particularly was featured on the website WorldStarHipHop, promptly helping to propel Heaton to prominence, and subsequently taking meetings with several record labels. Heaton graduated high school six months early and self-financed the recording of a host of her own songs, opting to take a step back and build \\"a catalog that we were proud of\\" with her manager Lauren, eventually signing with All Def Digital in 2014, a YouTube-based label founded by Steve Rifkind and Def Jam-founder Russell Simmons, in partnership with Capitol Records. She topped Billboard's Next Big Sound chart on April 24, 2014. On September 23, 2014, Heaton released her debut extended play, Bad Intentions, digitally in the United States, topping the Billboard + Twitter Trending 140 chart and reaching the top ten in the U.S. iTunes Store on the day of its release. On April 28, 2015, she posted an open letter online expressing frustration with her label and explaining the delay for her music. On June 13, 2015, she launched a website, NBK (Naturyl Born Killers), stating \\"NBK is the movement,\\" where new music was then independently released for free regularly in following months. Heaton later clarified, \\"We are now in a place where we can create music that I want to create, and we are no longer tied to the people that were holding me back,\\" revealing she had started producing music herself as well. On October 20, 2015, she premiered her debut music video for a song titled \\"Lullaby,\\" on Apple Music. Also in October, Heaton announced her first headlining concert tour, The Bedroom Tour, with twenty dates throughout the United States and Canada, beginning on November 13 in Houston, Texas and concluding on December 18 in Los Angeles, California. On March 18, 2016, Heaton released The Bedroom Tour Playlist, a mixtape titled similarly to the tour, compiling remixed and remastered material she had shared online and debuted on live shows in previous months. In a mid-2016 interview, Heaton announced that she was planning her debut studio album, stating \\"I want my it to be an actual masterpiece... I want my first album to be legendary\\". The Centerfold Tour was Heaton's second tour, containing forty-three shows in North America. It began on October 6, 2016, in Athens, Georgia, and ended on December 16, 2016, in Austin, Texas. Artistry While talking about her songwriting, Heaton said, \\"My music is a direct reflection of who I am. My writing is everything to me because that's all I had growing up. I had a really tough childhood and at a point when I was very young, I sort just stopped speaking because I stuttered,\\" mentioning her inability to have friends, causing her to always be alone due to her mother staying with her sister in the hospital, her father being drunk and the rest of her family living in South Africa, so she \\"would just write all the time.\\" \\"Even when I'm not writing literally about things that have happened to me, all the pain of my childhood and losing my sister ends up getting pushed into my music,\\" she adds about her creative inspiration and wanting to be proud of the message in her music, \\"It shapes my songs and builds this deeper meaning under everything, which is one of the most important things to me.\\" She has mentioned being heavily influenced by Bob Dylan and Tom Waits and is also a fan of hip hop, pointing out rappers like Kanye West, 2 Chainz, Jay Z, Drake and Nicki Minaj as other inspirations. Heaton addressed claims regarding her social media presence in platforms such as Instagram overshadowing her music saying, \\"If I can use what I have aesthetically to draw people in, then why not use it? I'm not going to put on a turtleneck just to prove a point, or to make people feel more comfortable according to society's standards.\\" Heaton notes her writing style and musical roots come from growing up with \\"older siblings who listened to a lot of soul and bluegrass and alternative,\\" and her sister's love of poetry, having discovered rapper Lil Jon when she was ten, which sparked her interest in hip- hop music, describing her sound as \\"those two worlds colliding, like folk, rhythm, and Shakespeare sonnets mixed with Kanye trap beats.\\" Discography Studio albums { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of extended plays, with selected details and chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\" The Lullaby Album  * Release: TBD * Label: Independent * Formats: Digital download, streaming } Extended plays { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of extended plays, with selected details and chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\\" US ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US Digital - ! scope=\\"row\\" Bad Intentions  * Released: September 23, 2014 * Label: Awesomeness Music * Formats: Digital download, streaming  38  17 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Starting Over  *Released: October 5, 2018 * Label: Capitol Records * Formats: Digital download, streaming  ‚Äì  ‚Äì } Mixtapes { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of mixtapes, with selected details and chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US Digital - ! scope=\\"row\\" The Bedroom Tour Playlist  * Released: March 18, 2016 * Label: Capitol Records * Formats: Digital download, LP  39  8 } Singles { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of singles, with selected details and chart positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\"  Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Year ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Peaks ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:9em;\\" Certifications ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Album - ! style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" US Pop Digital ! style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" US Rhythmic - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Bad Intentions\\"  2016  28  25  * RIAA: Gold  The Bedroom Tour Playlist } Promotional singles { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of singles, with selected details and chart positions ! style=\\"width:17em;\\" Title !

Overview Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin were born on the same day, February 12, 1809. Both lost their mother at a young age and, despite their differences in upbringing, both men saw themselves as autodidacts. Lander argues that they also shared an interest in science and a skeptical approach to religion. Darwin closely followed the events of the American Civil War and wanted Lincoln and the Union to prevail, but it is unlikely that Lincoln read Darwin's work. Lincoln and Darwin is structured as a series of alternating narratives concerning each man's interactions with the events and discoveries of the mid-19th century. Lander explores similarities in the intellectual development, concerns, and impacts of Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin, focusing in particular on the issue of slavery in the United States, which both men influentially opposed. Lander's broader argument is that Lincoln and Darwin shared the same outlook on the central issues of race, science, and religion. He also looks at the relationship between science and race in the 19th century United States and the emergence and influence of scientific racism. Lander situates Lincoln and Darwin against their respective opponents: Stephen A. Douglas, Lincoln's rival in Illinois politics, and Louis Agassiz, an advocate of polygenism. Critical reception Tom Allen, in The Journal of the Civil War Era, wrote that Lincoln and Darwin \\"is not always completely convincing\\" with regard to the \\"shared vision\\" Lander identifies, but concluded that the book \\"is well worth reading. The prose is delightfully lucid, and the parallel account of two lives so apparently different provides a fresh perspective on the intellectual culture of the nineteenth century.\\" Jean H. Baker, writing in Civil War History, described Lincoln and Darwin as \\"a profound comparison of the two men's perspectives and ... a worthy addition to the numerous individual studies of either man\\", and praised Lander for providing a new means of understanding and appreciating each man. Steven Conn, in the Reports of the National Center for Science Education, noted that Lander's comparisons occasionally appear \\"a little strained\\", but that \\"more often than not these comparisons and juxtapositions persuade\\"; and praised in particular Lander's analysis of the interactions between race and science. Stephen L. Hansen, in the Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, criticized Lander's \\"optimistic and sentimental view\\" of Lincoln's attitudes on race, but praised the book's \\"readable style\\" and concluded \\"This is a book that should be read, discussed, and enjoyed.\\" Mark Largent, writing in Isis described Lincoln and Darwin as \\"a strange project\\", but nonetheless \\"quite engaging because it allows Lander to bring into focus broad questions about the relationship between individuals and their contexts as well as some specific questions about mid-nineteenth-century Western thought.\\" David Turley, writing in American Nineteenth Century History, observed that the book contains little original research and questioned the coherence of its themes \\"applied to Lincoln and Darwin together\\", but praised \\"Lander's lucid, succinct, and up-to-date accounts of the topics that he deploys to illustrate his protagonists' involvement with his three main themes.\\" See also *Between Heaven and Hell, a novel by Peter Kreeft about a fictional discussion in purgatory among John F.

It was directed by James MacTaggart.  Synopsis  After she's dumped by her boyfriend, BBC script editor Norah Palmer (Anna Cropper) leaves her friends Jake (Julian Holloway) and Madge (Amanda Walker) in London and moves to the house that she'd bought with her boyfriend in the countryside in Southern England. Norah finds the village people strange but endearing, notably Mrs. Vigo (Freda Bamford), a busybody housekeeper; Mr. Fisher (Bernard Hepton), a historian; Mr. Wellbeloved, the butcher; and Peter, an old man who compulsively chops wood. After she discovers an infestation of mice at her house, the villagers suggest she seek out someone named Rob, who they tell her lives in the woods. Norah finds \\"Rob,\\" who turns out to be a young, handsome exterminator named Edgar, who spends his spare time practising karate nearly nude in the forest. Edgar successfully clears Norah's house of the mice. Although she finds him personally boring, Norah is nonetheless attracted to him. After an incident in which he kills a bird that someone drops down her chimney, Norah sleeps with him, despite having misplaced her diaphragm. Soon after, Norah discovers that she's pregnant. She returns home to London for an abortion, but decides against the procedure at the last minute and goes back to the cabin. As Easter approaches, she discovers that she's slowly being cut off from the outside world: her phone lines are cut, her car is tampered with, and the local bus driver refuses to stop for her. Norah begins to believe that she's the victim of a village-wide conspiracy and that the village plans to sacrifice her and take her child. Norah lets Edgar into her house, as he seems to be the only village person not involved in the conspiracy. While they discuss what's been happening, the villagers converge on the house in a lynch mob. Against her expectations, the villagers leave Norah alone, but Edgar is gone, apparently sacrificed. Mr. Fisher explains that the nickname \\"Rob\\" came from \\"Robin\\" and that \\"Robin redbreast\\" is a special totem in the pagan religion of the town. Edgar/Robin was raised from birth by the townspeople with the purpose of becoming a sacrificial lamb.bfi.org.uk/publications: Robin Redbreast Fisher explains that Norah's child will be the next Robin, and offers to raise the child for her so that she can return to a normal life in London. Norah refuses, but is allowed to leave nonetheless.

Emerson composed the poem in late 1862 and read it publicly in Boston Music Hall on January 1, 1863. It commemorates the Emancipation Proclamation issued earlier that day by President Abraham Lincoln, tying it and the broader campaign for the abolition of slavery to the Puritan notion of sacred destiny for America. Political context Abraham Lincoln in 1863, the year he issued the Emancipation Proclamation In 1861 the American Civil War began, with a number of Southern states rebelling against the United States government (known as the Union) led by President Abraham Lincoln. The primary issue was slavery, which was endemic in the South but which Lincoln's Republican Party sought to abolish. In September 1862, Lincoln warned that he would declare free all slaves held in any state still in rebellion at the start of the next year. He accomplished this on January 1, 1863, with the Emancipation Proclamation. In the years leading up to the war's outbreak, Emerson's home city of Boston was a \\"hotbed\\" of abolitionism in the United States. In one incident in 1854, an angry mob protested federal troops as they marched Anthony Burns, a fugitive slave, out of Boston to be returned to bondage in Virginia.Tindall & Shi, p. 696. Emerson came to identify publicly with the cause of abolitionism following the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. By 1851 he was numbered among the prominent \\"Free Soiler\\" poets. History An artist's rendering of Boston Music Hall, where Emerson first read \\"Boston Hymn\\" In December 1862, as Lincoln's deadline approached, John Sullivan Dwight approached Emerson, asking him to compose and read a poem as part of a concert planned for January 1 to celebrate the proclamation. Emerson was initially noncommittal, citing scheduling conflicts, but ultimately relented. His work on the poem was rushed, due to the short time frame and the poet's many other commitments. The bulk of the work of the poem came on December 31, the day before its debut. On January 1, a crowd of 3,000 gathered at Boston Music Hall for the concert. By Emerson's request his name was not in the program, and his participation in the event was a surprise to the audience. Contemporary accounts indicate that his reading was well received. Emerson read the poem again that day at a private gathering at the home of George Luther Stearns in Medford, Massachusetts. Other guests included Wendell Phillips, Amos Bronson Alcott, Louisa May Alcott, and Julia Ward Howe, who read her \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\". \\"Boston Hymn\\" was first published in the January 24, 1863, issue of Dwight's eponymous Dwight's Journal of Music. It was reprinted in the following month's edition of The Atlantic. It also appeared in the 1867 Emerson anthology May-Day and Other Pieces. The poem \\"became famous immediately\\" and was adopted as an anthem by the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, an all-black regiment of the Union Army. Content Emerson, ca. 1857 \\"Boston Hymn\\" consists of 22 rhyming quatrains. The edition printed in The Atlantic omits a quatrain Emerson accidentally left out of the manuscript he sent to the printer. The poem recalls the conception of Boston as a \\"city upon a hill\\" that originated with Massachusetts Colony's Puritan founders, also called Pilgrims. According to a modern critic, the poem connects this history to the contemporary moment by \\"imagining wartime Boston as the legitimate inheritor of Puritan militance, severity, iconoclasm, and singleness of purpose, if not necessarily its literal theology.\\" (Indeed, Emerson's early working title was \\"The Pilgrims\\".) In this way, the poem places the Emancipation Proclamation within the history of the Puritans' mission in America and a fulfillment of America's sacred destiny. It conceives of a covenant between God and America, parallel to the covenant with Israel, in which adoption of the Puritan ideals of equality and democracy are rewarded with prosperity. The poem is narrated by God, suggesting divine authority behind the Emancipation Proclamation. \\"Boston Hymn\\" has specific earthly political messages, as well. It hails the Emancipation Proclamation as a more successful liberating document than the Declaration of Independence. It rejoins some of Emerson's contemporaries who called for emancipation strictly as a matter of military necessity. In one stanza, the poem calls for reparations to be paid to freed slaves for their labor: > Pay ransom to the owner, And fill the bag to the brim. Who is the owner? The > slave is the owner, And ever was. Pay him. This amounts also to a repudiation of the proposal that slaveowners be compensated for \\"property\\" lost in emancipation, a proposal Emerson himself once endorsed. In composing the poem, Emerson drew on ideas he had developed in his previous works, including essays, speeches, and other poems. He was influenced in particular by the Burns case.

Bayard locals refer to the Local 890 building as the \\"Union Hall\\", where it is used as a community meeting place. History On October 17, 1950 workers decided to strike after contract negotiations stalled in protest of racial injustice and indignities suffered while employed by Empire Zinc Company, then based out of Hanover, New Mexico. Mexican American workers suffered unequal pay and segregation in pay lines for Anglo and Mexican workers. The small communities of Bayard, Hurley and Santa Rita, where the workers lived, were segregated and the Mexicans suffered inferior sanitation, no electricity and unpaved streets. The public pool and movie theatre were also segregated. Mexican Americans were subject to police brutality. In response to all of this the miners formed picket lines at the gates of the mine and held the strike until June 1951 when a court injunction ordered for picketing to cease under threat of incarceration. The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 restricted the activity and leverage of labor unions. The wives of the miners formed the Ladies Auxiliary 209 and took up the cause of picketing on June 12, 1951 since the injunction only banned the miners themselves from doing so. Many of the women were threatened and jailed along with their children for protesting. The picket held for another six months until January 25, 1952, when negotiations were settled granting miners increased wages, benefits and housing conditions. This was the first successful mining strike in American history. Film News of the victory quickly spread and in 1953 Hollywood producer Paul Jarrico and director Herbert Biberman visited the Union Hall with a budget of $250,000 and the intention of recreating the story of the striking men and women for the 1954 film \\"Salt of the Earth\\". They cast five professional actors, among them Rosaura Revueltas, a native Mexican actress, as the leading role of pregnant striker Esperanza Quintero. The rest of the cast and extras were the strikers themselves and local people. Among them was Juan Chacon, who was Local 890 union president for many years, who was cast in the leading role of labor organizer Ramon Quintero. There were attempts to disrupt the shooting of the film including FBI investigation into its financing, flyovers by noisy aircraft interrupting production, rifle shots fired at the set. and the film had to be stored and edited in secret. Film processing labs and projectionist unions were rumored to have been told not to work on the film. The leading actress Rosaura Revueltas was deported back to Mexico during filming. Only twelve theaters in the country would screen the film and an official premiere in New York City did not happen until 10 years after completion. After filming, in 1957 director Herbert Biberman was questioned by the House Committee on Un-American Activities for Communist ties. He refused their questions and spent time in a federal prison. Jerrico, Biberman, Ruvueltas and actors Will Geer and Michael Wilson were part of the Hollywood blacklist during the Era of McCarthyism. The film itself was blacklisted, denounced by the United States House of Representatives, and was boycotted by the American Legion. In 2004, on the 50th anniversary of the making of the movie, the film was inducted to the Library of Congress National Film Registry for posterity as one of the top 100 films representing Americana. Ellen R. Baker directed a documentary on the two-year strike and the film production called \\"On Strike and On Film\\". Preservation Juntos de la Union is a society for the preservation of The Mine Mill and Smelter Workers Local 890 headquarters located in Bayard, New Mexico. The group was founded by Hueteotil Lopez of Silver City, New Mexico and has proposed that the Union Hall be recognized as a National Historic Landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. Juntos de la Union has secured a letter of support for the proposal from retired U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman of the Second New Mexico Congressional District. The Wisconsin Labor History Society and the City of Bayard, New Mexico Town Council has submitted letters of support as well. In October 2014 the Local 890 Union, one of the longest running unions in the country was disbanded by vote of the miners working now under Freeport-McMoRan. Local Silver City artist Fred Barraza with the support of the Mimbres Region Arts Council painted a mural of a photograph of the Ladies Auxiliary 290 that spans the side of the Union Hall.

From 1847 to 1890, Smallwood held public office in Choctaw Nation, except for the time he served as an officer in the Civil War. Early life He was born in 1829 in Choctaw Nation to William and Mary (LeFore) Smallwood in Choctaw Nation in Mississippi.Littlefield, Daniel F., and James W. Parins. A Biobibliography of Native American Writers, 1772-1924: A Supplement, Scarecrow Press, 1895. p. 286-287. When he was a young child, his family moved to Indian Territory on the Choctaw Trail of Tears.Meserve, John Bartlett. \\"Chief Benjamin Franklin Smallwood and Chief Jefferson Gardner,\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma, Volume 19, No. 3, September, 1941. As a child, Smallwood attended Spencer Academy in Choctaw Nation. Political career Smallwood began his political career in 1847, when he served as a ranger in Kiamichi County. Also beginning in 1847, he held the office of representative to the Choctaw Council. In his subsequent career, he served as speaker of the lower house and delegate to Washington, D.C. As delegate to Washington, he was responsible for negotiating agreements between the Choctaw and the United States government.Native Peoples A to Z: A Reference Guide to Native Peoples of the Western Hemisphere, Native American Book Publishers, 2009. Volume 8, p.2188. He ran for Principal Chief in 1886 as candidate for the National Party but was defeated by Progressive Party candidate Thompson McKinney. In 1888, he was again the National Party's candidate for Principal Chief, this time running against Progressive candidate Wilson Nathaniel Jones. Because of his long career in the house of representatives, he was popular enough to win the election even though the Progressive Party won the majority of seats in both houses of the Choctaw Council. Because the chief and the council represented different parties, Smallwood was able to accomplish little politically during his years in office. Politically, Smallwood was very concerned about maintaining the independence of Choctaw Nation and resisting interference from the U.S. Government. He was troubled by the establishment of a federal court in Indian TerritoryMihesuah, Devon Abbott, Choctaw Crime and Punishment, 1884-1907, University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, Oklahoma, 2012, p.60. and a law authorizing appeals to the United States authority on matters of Choctaw citizenship after a Choctaw court decision had already been made. He also refused to allow the incorporation of towns established by whites who had moved into Choctaw nation. These towns, which included Krebs and Lehigh lacked official status and public services, including water and sewer systems and fire and police protections. Important political meetings of Choctaw legislators, religious leaders, and members of the United States Congress were held at Smallwood's home on his ranch near Lehigh, the Benjamin Franklin Smallwood House. This was because Smallwood would not meet with representatives of the U.S. government unless they came to his house. In 1888, the U.S. Government made a payment to Choctaw Nation, and Smallwood called a special session of the Council, which authorized that the funds were to be dispersed without an audit by the Net Proceeds Commission. The payment was for the Leased District, which was originally owned by the Choctaw but had been granted to the United States by treaty in 1855.May, Jon D. \\"Leased District,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, Oklahoma Historical Society, Accessed July 4, 2015. Smallwood himself pocketed $5,500 of the funds. According to Meserve in the Chronicles of Oklahoma, this \\"constitutes one of the dark pages in Choctaw history.\\" He ran for reelection in 1890 but was defeated by Wilson Nathaniel Jones.May, Jon D. \\"Jones, Wilson Nathaniel,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, Oklahoma Historical Society, Accessed July 4, 2015. During his time in office, Smallwood had advocated for the expansion of Choctaw schools, but due to the divisive political situation, he made little progress. Jones and the new council nonetheless followed his recommendations and added more schools, though Smallwood received no credit. Civil War Service During the United States Civil War, Smallwood was Captain of the 2nd Choctaw Regiment in the Confederate Army. Business and ranching Smallwood first opened a store in Kiamichi County in 1862. The next year, he moved to Lehigh. Smallwood owned a farm near Lehigh, raised cattle, and ran a dry goods store in town.Dary, David. Stories of Old Time Oklahoma, University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, Oklahoma, 2015. p. 109. The sandstone house on his ranch, constructed in 1875, is known as the Benjamin Franklin Smallwood House.

Accessed July 2, 2015. Retirement After being defeated for reelection, Smallwood retired to his home near Lehigh, where he died on December 15, 1891. Personal life In 1849, Smallwood married Annie Burney, a Chickasaw from the house of Ima-te-po of the family of Okla-pa-nubbii. Annie died during the Civil War. Smallwood later married Abbie James.

Its purpose is to provide outlet for talented individuals by creating challenging problems and organising academic camps. The seminar organisers are mostly undergraduate students from FMFI, Comenius University, Slovakia and other distinguished universities, such Cambridge University. FKS is the part of Trojsten, an NGO supporting educational activities in Slovakia in the field of mathematics, physics and computer science.FKS, Correspondence Seminar - About us (in Slovak)\\". Retrieved September 30, 2015 The purpose of the FKS is, firstly, to motivate high school students to become proficient in physics and problem solving in general; secondly, to prepare some the students for international competitions such as the International Physics Olympiad, International Young Physicists' Tournament); and thirdly, to support them in preparing for studies at world's top universities, such as Oxford University, Cambridge University or Ivy League colleges. The alumni are well-positioned to become university researchers or engineers at prominent IT companies.  History  The roots of FKS date back to 1985, when J√°n Pi≈°√∫t, a university professor inspired by emerging mathematical correspondence seminars throughout Slovakia and Central Europe, founded a similar competition for physics enthusiasts. FKS, as well as other correspondence seminars, were created in the 1980s in order to provide high-school students informal way of teaching STEM subjects by professors and students at FMFI UK. From the start FKS was organized primarily by professors at FMFI UK, but gradually the students took over. In its 30-year history, the seminar has raised a fair number of young physicists, who have studied or worked at best Slovak and world's universities. From the pedagogical point of view, FKS was influenced by the work of Milan Hejny, a Slovak mathematician who developed several novel methods to teach mathematics, which have been applied in Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and other countries. Nowadays, Prof Hejny works as a professor at Faculty of Education at Charles University in Prague. Wikipedia, Milan Hejny (in Czech), \\"Wikipedia, Milan Hejny\\". Retrieved August 3, 2015  The main, correspondence part  The correspondence competition runs over the whole school year and is divided in two parts: winter and summer, each consisting of three problem sets. They are two categories: B-category (for younger students) and A-category (for older students). The aim of the FKS problems is to be more than just textbook exercises; successful solution requires creativity and original approach. Participants are expected to factually support their conclusions, construct well-argued numerical estimations, design and perform experiments or write computational simulations. The participants send their solutions either via traditional mail or electronically via a submission system or email. The organizers mark their solutions and send them back together with model answers. There is strong emphasis on pointing out flaws or imperfections in reasoning or, on the other hand, highlighting the positive aspects of the solution. Consequently, at the end of each semester, best 36 participants are invited to attend week-long winter and summer camps.  Other activities of the FKS   Summer and winter camps  As a reward, the best seminar participants are invited to take part in winter or summer camps. The length of the camps is typically one week and the location is the countryside of Slovakia. A typical day at the camp consists of lectures on advanced topics from the university undergraduates in the morning and an adventure program in the afternoon and evening.  UFO  Apart from the seminar for high school students, there is UFO, a primary school version for students of age of up to 15 years launched in 2008. Its structure and organization are similar to the main seminar, enabling synergies in organisation. To strengthen the community ties, the high schools students that participate in the main seminar are often help organising UFO.  FX  FX is a special category designed for most passionate students, who aspire to become professional researchers. The problems often involve advanced mathematical methods, such as differentiation or integration, and concepts from undergraduate physics curriculum, and require intense self-study prior to submission. The participants can send their solutions several times; after each trial they get feedback from the authors of the problems. This iterative system enables every participant to improve at their own pace. The launch of FX was in 2005. The participants are annually invited to the FX Spring School, an intense week-long camp. Compared with other FKS camps, this camp is academically more demanding, as the lectures constitute the major part of the programme. The emphasis is on developing independent thinking and problem solving skills easily transferable to university research. Participants of the FX Spring School are typically the students representing Slovakia at international competitions and scoring medals.  FKS Summer School  The FKS Summer School is a two-week summer camp organised at FMFI, Comenius University, Slovakia. The aim of FKS Summer School is primarily to broaden the physics knowledge of a large number of motivated students, not necessarily the participants of correspondence seminar, and thus increasing competition in physics competitions in Slovakia like Physics Olympiad or Young Physicist's Tournament. Secondary, to create a place when students can meet real physicists and popularize the science. The emphasis is put also on development of soft-skills.  Physics N√°boj  Physics N√°boj (Bullet) is a team competition for high school students held each year in November. Teams representing high schools and consisting of up to five students compete in a time limit of about 1h30min in solving as many problems as possible. Each team starts with eight problems; after successful of a problem they receive a new one to solve. Approximately 400 students are annually involved in this competition. There is also a mathematical version of this competition. The idea of organising a nationwide competition for high school teams arose from games played at FKS summer/winter camps called \\"N√Åstenkov√Ω BOJ\\", literally \\"a notice-board fight\\". (After successful solution of a problem, a new one appeared on a large notice-board.) The first Physics Naboj was held in 1998. In 2015, Naboj was for the first time organized internationally (next to Bratislava, in Prague and Budapest) with the help of local educational organizations. The future plans are to increase this unique international collaboration by expanding to other countries in the region.  The Trojsten Academy and Club Trojsten Academy serves as a one-day event of Trojsten annually organized in December, where university professors and prominent scientists deliver lectures on e.g. quantum mechanics, quantum information, condensed matter, etc. Trojsten Club is an accompanying one-day event to the Academy, Mathematics Naboj and Physics Naboj. In Trojsten Club organizers of correspondence seminars give popular lectures and organize city adventure games or other experience programs for high-school students.

Family Wife - Elizabeth Ramsay Weir Daughters - Alison Elizabeth Weir, Christine Helen Baxter, Moira Maris Weir Career Weir played for junior club Baillieston in the late 1940s. He started his senior career with amateur side Queen's Park, where he replaced Ronnie Simpson as their regular goalkeeper in 1950. Weir attracted the attention of professional clubs with his performances, particularly for the Scotland amateur team. He moved to Motherwell in August 1954 and soon afterwards he played in the 1954 Scottish League Cup Final, which Motherwell lost 4‚Äì2 to Heart of Midlothian. The character of the Motherwell team changed significantly during Weir's eight years with the club. When he arrived, they had an ageing team that had enjoyed success in the early 1950s (winning the 1951‚Äì52 Scottish Cup) with a very strong defence. Motherwell would have been relegated in 1954‚Äì55, but were saved from that fate by the league's divisions being reconstructed. Under the management of Bobby Ancell, Motherwell developed a very strong forward line in the late 1950s. The team were known as the Ancell Babes and featured a young Ian St John. One unusual incident involving Ancell, St John and Weir was that, in the early 1960s, most of the Motherwell team had agreed to take a bribe from gamblers to lose a match against Third Lanark. Weir found out about the fix minutes before kick-off and reacted badly, complaining to Ancell. The fix then quickly collapsed and Motherwell went on to win the match, with St John scoring a hat-trick. Sports journalist Bob Crampsey, writing in 2000, said that this Motherwell team was \\"probably the finest pure footballing side that Scotland has ever produced\\". Motherwell were largely dedicated to attacking play, leaving gaps in defence that meant Weir had plenty of work to do in their goal. One notable achievement was to defeat Rangers four times in the 1960‚Äì61 season, including a 5‚Äì2 win at Ibrox in a 1960‚Äì61 Scottish Cup tie. Despite these plaudits, Motherwell did not win any trophies during this period. The team was soon broken up, as the star forward players were sold to finance improvements to Fir Park. Despite becoming a professional player, Weir had continued a business career. and a move to India effectively ended his football career. In the 1980s whilst working in the Far East, he suffered severe injuries in an industrial accident in Bangkok.

It is a native perennial sunflower that resembles other members of this family including the Pale Sunflower (H. decapetalus), Woodland Sunflower (H. divaricatus), Hispid Sunflower (H. hirsutus), and Jerusalem Artichoke (H. tuberosus). Pale-leaf sunflowers can be found in a diverse range of habitats including woodland areas, prairies, and meadows, providing that these habitats have access to partial sun.  Description  Helianthus strumosus definitively smooth stem Growing from a rhizomatous root system, H. strumosus grows from three to eight feet in height. The pale-leaf sunflower can be difficult to distinguish since it is the most variable of the sunflowers. Some distinguishing features include the petioles, leaves, and stem. The petioles are an inch in length. The leaves tend to be thick and more narrow than other species. The leaves are white underneath. H. strumosus also has a definitively smooth stem. The flower head of H. strumosus has a yellow center surrounded by a variable (usually 8-20) number of yellow ray florets.  Distribution  Helianthus strumosus is a widely distributed in North America. It is found in the central and eastern United States, and southeastern parts of Canada. It is found more regularly in non-wetland areas, although it can occur in wetlands. The woodland sunflower is normally found in moist to moderately moist and sandy to loamy sandy areas. H. strumosus grows in natural, disturbed, and man-made habitats. The population can quickly become dense. These flowers must go through a minimum 30 day cold stratification before they are able to germinate.  Growth Inhibiting Factors  Helianthus strumosus has been known to be attacked by the pyreno mycetous fungus Gibberidea heliopsis. This fungus attacks not only various species of the Heliantheae tribe, but also within the Astereae tribes. The fungus has been found in the southern parts of Wisconsin with Helianthus strumosus being one of the fungus primary target. The Gibberidea disease is most recognized on Helianthus strumosus with black lesions running along the side or encircling the stem of the flower. Another distinguishing feature of the disease are papillate surface of mature lesions that can be seen with a hand lens since the fungal papillae breaks through or replaces the epidermis. The first symptoms of the disease are seen around late May and occur on the sides of young leaf blades.  Uses  The roots of H. strumosus are one of the only edible parts of the plant. They can be boiled down to make a liquor that has been used to treat adults and children with worms. The roots can also be used to make an infusion to help with lung related problems. Seeds from this sunflower can be used to make an oil for cooking and soap making.

The inhabitant of Tamburawa are Hausa, mostly lecturers, farmers, union workers, and businessmen. Irrigation farming is widely practiced. Tamburawa which is also known as Tamburawa Yamma, is a unique and homogeneous town. In the 2006 population census, Tamburawa and its remote villages were marked with a number of approximately 13,453 inhabitants. It is also divided into four major zones i.e. Kofar Arewa, Kofar Gabas, Kofar Yamma, and lastly Kofar Kudu. The people of Tamburawa have great enthusiasm for the game of football. It has a particular team that normally stands for the town in competitions or leagues that is Tamburawa United. The geographical location of Tamburawa is 11,52W 17,50E and 8,32 15.55E. standing 1450 ft above sea level. Tamburawa people of course practice child marriage in the community although they are said to be doing it according to the Shariah Law. Tamburawa is the centre of a prosperous, densely populated, agricultural region in which millet, rice, peanuts, and beans are produced. It is an important market centre for peanuts, livestock, grains, and other foodstuffs from the surrounding area. The people of Tamburawa are mostly followers of one religion, which is Islam. About 99.9% of the people are Muslims. Major developments In 2007, the governor of Kano State announced the project of the Tamburawa Water treatment work, which supplies about 13 local governments with treated water. Tamburawa Water Treatment Plant has the capacity to deliver 150 million litres of potable water per day to the city of Kano and surrounding areas. The raw water is sourced from the Kano River, and treated using conventional treatment processes to produce potable water that readily exceeds World Health Organisation‚Äôs minimum requirements for drinking water. The multi-billion project was accomplished by COSTAIN Construction Company, which provided employment opportunity to the people of Tamburawa because of the availability of labour. Pfizer in 2009 reached a separate $75 million settlement with Kano State government to compensate victims of the experimental antibiotic Trovan on children during a meningitis outbreak without receiving adequate prior consent. Following the choice of the Kano State Government, and provision of land by the state government, the board commenced work on construction of a Diagnostic and Disease Control Centre in Tamburawa, Kano State in 2010. The over $25.5 million (4.4 billion Naira) facility sits on 9.6 hectares of land with a built-up area of approximately 2.9 hectares. The health facility, which has been completed and fully equipped, is already handed over to the Kano State government. The centre contains various facilities including: public health laboratory, micro biological reference laboratory, diagnostic centre, 100 beds patient ward facility, ultra-modern kitchen and dining facility, staff quarters and mortuary Gains for Kano. The state-of-the-art medical facility is a unique medical facility that has the potential to uplift health care in Kano in particular and Nigeria in general. It provides facilities for the training of medical doctors and other key health care professionals in the country. It houses special facilities for conducting research for infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera, poliomyelitis and meningitis among others. The DDCC has facilities to quarantine patients during epidemic outbreak just like the recent Ebola outbreak. Experts said the facility will assist medical personnel in tracking individual strains of causative agents and diseases so as to determine the required medication. The facility which has a functional public health laboratory to conduct research into other aspects of medicine bordering on public safety will as well boost research efforts in Nigeria. The Medical Centre currently employs security men, gardeners and artisans from the local population. Though Tamburawa is in the Outskirt of Kano, it is highly connected to the Major city of Kano with a ranging distance of about 10‚Äì15 km away from the city with a good transportation Network. The history of Tamburawa‚Äôs rise as a Hausa Community, and its emergence as a major remote town is documented in the Kano Chronicle, a richly detailed manuscript compiled in the 18th to 19th century from earlier sources.

John Meade CB ( - 6 August 1849) was an Irish officer in the British Army. After leaving the professional army he served as a militia officer in Ireland, and sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom for twelve years before taking up a diplomatic post.  Early life and family  Born around 1775, Meade was the third son of John Meade, 1st Viscount Clanwilliam (later 1st Earl of Clanwilliam). His mother Theodosia was a daughter and co-heir of Robert Hawkins Magill, who sat in the Irish House of Commons for County Down from 1724 to 1745.  Military and political career  Meade joined the British Army on 30 October 1794, as an ensign in Lieutenant- Colonel Macnamara's Regiment. He was transferred to Lieutenant-Colonel Ward's Regiment and promoted to lieutenant on 12 November 1794. After that regiment was disbanded in 1795, he joined the 12th Regiment of Foot. In June 1796, he sailed aboard the Rockingham East Indiaman, going out with the regiment to India. Meade was briefly put up as a candidate for County Down for the 1797 election. His mother had inherited estates at Gilford and Rathfriland which gave the family a small electoral interest there under her management. After Meade's announcement, the anti-Unionist Lord Downshire and the Unionist Lord Londonderry, holders of the largest electoral interests in the county, agreed to combine against him and split the two county seats between them, avoiding the enormous expense of a contested election. In the face of this coalition, the Countess withdrew Meade's candidacy. He was promoted to a captain in the 9th Regiment of Foot on 27 August 1799 and took part in the Helder Expedition and the Ferrol Expedition, then with the rest of Sir James Pulteney's command to Lisbon. On 4 June 1801, he purchased a commission as major in the 30th Regiment of Foot. Meade was promoted from the 30th to become a lieutenant- colonel in the 16th Garrison Battalion, in Ireland, on 8 December 1804. He went on half-pay when that regiment was disbanded in February 1805 and was appointed to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 45th Regiment of Foot on 30 March 1805. In 1805, an electoral struggle broke out in Down, site of the Meade family's remaining estates. The sitting MP Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh (son of Lord Londonderry) was a close confidant of the Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, and was obliged to seek re-election when he was appointed as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. Castlereagh had alienated the dowager Lady Downshire, the county's biggest landowner, who determined to contest the by-election with her own candidate. John's mother Lady Clanwilliam agreed to join with Lady Downshire in promoting his candidacy against Castlereagh. The Londonderry and Downshire interests spent lavishly: the Downshires may have spent as much as ¬£30,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) on the by-election in July 1805, from which Meade emerged victorious, giving Lady Downshire control of both the county's seats. In the Commons, Meade voted with the opposition until 1812. He took leave from Parliament to fight in the Peninsular War in 1810, and commanded the 45th at the Battle of Bussaco. However, he was present in Parliament, and not with the regiment, during the 1812 campaign. Meade retired from active service in June 1813. By then the Downshire and Londonderry interests had reached a truce, so Meade switched his support to the government. He was appointed a brevet-colonel on 4 June 1813, and made a Companion of the Bath on 4 June 1815. On 2 October 1816, he married Urania Caroline (died November 1851), the daughter of Edward Ward, by whom he had four sons. *Capt. John Meade (1824‚Äìbef. 1894?) *Maj.

She was the first woman to hold the position of Chief of the Monacan Indian Nation, a state-recognized tribe based in the Bear Mountain region of Amherst County, Virginia. Bryant, who was elected chief in 2011, led the ongoing efforts to win federal recognition for the Monacans. Biography Bryant was born on June 22, 1961. Her Monacan tribal name was \\"Bear Woman.\\" Her grandfather, Harry Loving Branham, had also served as the Monacan chief during the 1960s. She was a lifetime resident of Amherst County, Virginia. Bryant dropped out of Amherst County High School at the age of 16, but later obtained her GED and pursued higher education. In a 2015 interview, Bryant said she dreamed one day becoming Monacan chief. An Episcopal lay minister, Bryant was training to become an Episcopal priest at the time of her death. Chief of the Monacan Indian Nation Bryant's entry into tribal, state and federal politics was motivated by a history of discrimination against the Monacan people. The first registrar for the Virginia Bureau of Vital Statistics, Dr. Walter Plecker, who held the position from 1912 to 1946, refused to acknowledge that the Monacans, or any of the other Virginian Native American tribes, were distinct, \\"real\\" people and ethnic groups. He orchestrated a series of racially motivated, discriminatory policies against the Monacans. The Virginia Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which was supported by Plecker, required that all Virginians be classified as either \\"white\\" or \\"colored.\\" Plecker altered the birth records and other records of the Monacans and other Native Americans, listing their identity as \\"colored,\\" thus denying members' Native American heritage. Years later, because of the \\"colored\\" birth records, the U.S. federal government declined to grant federal recognition to the Monacans. The legacy of Plecker's racist policies fueled both a revival of the Monacan culture and Bryant's entry into politics years later. Bryant served on the tribe's economic development committee prior to her election as chief. In 2011, Kenneth Branham, who had served as Chief of the Monacans for four terms, did not seek re-election in the June tribal election. Sharon Bryant was elected Chief of the Monacan Indian Nation in June 2011, becoming the first woman to serve in that position. She defeated Joe Dorey of Rockbridge County, in the election. As Chief, Bryant worked with Virginia's federal congressmen and U.S. Senators to seek federal recognition for the Monacan Indian Nation. The tribe has already been recognized by the state of Virginia. She sought to make the tribe financially sustainable. Bryant oversaw the creation of several smaller, local programs as well, including Christmas gifting exchange. She partnered with Natural Bridge Park, site of the tribe's annual festival, the Monacan Nation Powwow. Death On June 23, 2015, Bryant died in her home at the age of 54, as a result of cancer. She had undergone cancer treatment and surgery, but was diagnosed with liver cancer less than one month before her death. Bryant had planned to run for a second term as Chief in the June 2015 tribal elections, but was forced to drop out of the race due to her cancer diagnosis. Elections were held in later in June 2015 to choose her successor.

The game was released on 17 April 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Linux, OS X. The player takes on the role of an advertising magnate in a dystopian future city with a cyberpunk aesthetic. The game has had a mixed reception. Gameplay Megacorporations seen in the cyberspace view. Gameplay in AdvertCity involves selling advertising to client megacorporations; the player does this by moving around the city from a first person god-view perspective, selecting buildings and sites in cyberspace as targets for their advertising. Advertising technologies are unlocked progressively depending on reputation with various megacorporations, and range from flyers to billboards and blimps. A key mechanic in the game is the ability to switch between meatspace and cyberspace at any time, which is required to perform different actions in each space and to orchestrate advertising effectively. The goal of the game is to take over the city, and to do this the player must gain the trust of the various megacorporations they interact with. The game has a roguelike save system to increase the level of challenge - there is only one savegame available, the player has no choice but to save their progress when exiting, and the player cannot reload to a previous state if they make a mistake. Development Development of the game began when an early version of the game was built in 7 days for the 2014 Cyberpunk Game Jam. After receiving positive feedback during the jam, the developers decided to continue work on the game to create a full-scale release. The game sought crowdfunding via Kickstarter on 25 March 2014, and was fully funded on the second day of the campaign, going on be overfunded by 373% at its conclusion. AdvertCity was submitted to Steam Greenlight during its Kickstarter in 2014 and was eventually greenlit after an unusually long delay in April 2015. AdvertCity entered a period of closed beta testing during development after its kickstarter; the final release was announced on 17 April 2015, and by June it had appeared on Steam and several other stores. Procedural city generation Every city in the game is procedurally generated. The procedural city layout is positioned on top of a procedurally generated landscape, which it conforms to and evolves around. The developers considered using the industry standard SIGGRAPH 2001 paper by Parish and Muller as a basis, including the subsequent work on tensor fields, but rejected the use of L-systems on the grounds of their design being unsuited to cities, which \\"don't grow like branches on a tree\\". The system instead uses: > \\"...maps calculated on a mix of realtime procedural projection and cached > data about population layouts and terrain features (such as different > terrain types, gradients, altitudes, population densities, whether the > region should be considered urban or rural etc); the result is something > that has the subtlety of the tensor field system, yet generates much larger > cities than are feasible with the L-system at a far higher speed than > possible with that design. The AdvertCity generator is an object-oriented > system of roads, junctions and buildings that can be adjusted on the fly to > interact with their immediate surroundings, so roads meet and cross at > specific junctions, branch and fork (something not used in the L system > design), and can also spontaneously degenerate from paved roads to footpaths > etc as appropriate, due to terrain or other aspects of the landscape. > Different classes of road or path can also have entirely different rules and > code for how they react to different terrain types and other features, so > it's possible to build a much more dynamic overall city map with those.\\" Procedural descriptions Every building in the city has a procedurally generated description; these vary in content but usually mention the architectural style of the building and some information about its history as well as factual info about its current owners and tenants in-game and its population. All megacorporations are also described with text that is procedurally generated and updated during gameplay as their situation changes; this describes their standing in the city, their relationships with other megacorps, their financial status and their sentiments towards the player. Soundtrack AdvertCitys soundtrack is a full-length score, unusual in that it is presented in two \\"sides\\", one for meatspace and one for cyberspace, with each track on each side having a beatmatched equivalent on the other; when the player switches between meatspace and cyberspace, the music smoothly crossfades between the two soundtracks. A bespoke sound engine was developed for this purpose, with EBU R128 2011 support and HDR capability. Reception From its initial alpha launch, AdvertCity drew comment widely about its stark and \\"hyper-stylized\\" aesthetic. Critics frequently praised the dark neo-noir cyberpunk aesthetic of the game, as well as its tone, and referred to the vision of cyberspace as Gibson-inspired. Stylistically, reviewers appreciated the dystopian bleakness of the vision of the future in the game, mentioning that your adverts are the only splashes of colour on the cold and uniform city, and the surreal building-linked conception of cyberspace. Reviewers also praised the dark and cynical sense of humour throughout the game. Reviewers also expressed interest in the Oculus Rift support which was included in the game from the alpha stage. One common complaint is the high level of difficulty and steep learning curve at the start of the game. Reviewers also cited the disorientating nature of the interface and immutable fast pace of the game as a negative. The developers cited games such as Dwarf Fortress as an inspiration, which is well known for its steep learning curve and difficult interface. The game also drew praise for its high-performing engine, which enables the game to run on previous-generation hardware; the minimum system requirements for CPU on Steam are stated simply as \\"Anything made since 2004\\" and the game supports Windows XP despite Microsoft having discontinued support for that operating system before development of AdvertCity began. Critics praised the \\"cyber-jazz\\" soundtrack's \\"postrock, jazz & glitch\\" qualities and praised the way it dovetails with the gameplay and \\"backs your every move\\" in the game.

Pultusk served in three campaigns, two of which resulted, some four decades later in the award of medals, and one boat action that too received a medal. She was broken up in 1810. Career On 31 August 1806, Austerlitz was off Martinique when she encountered the 10 or 12-gun schooner , which was under the command of Lieutenant Samuel Stout. Austerlitz was in the company of a sloop and a brig. Even though Prevost had had to throw overboard four of her guns in an earlier storm, Stout decided to fight. The subsequent action lasted an hour before Stout struck after having lost three men killed and seven wounded. Austerlitz took Prevost into Guadeloupe.Hepper (1994), p. 114. Capture On 5 April 1807 captured Austerlitz after an 18-hour pursuit. Austerlitz was armed with eighteen 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 125 men. Hugh Pigot of Circe reported that \\"This Vessel has done more Mischief to the Trade than any other from Guadaloupe during the War\\". The British had chased her several times without catching her and she would have escaped this time too had she not sprung her main topsail-yard and fore-top-gallant mast. The Royal Navy took Austerlitz into service as HMS Pultusk, changing her name from one celebrating a Napoleonic victory to one celebrating a setback for French forces. HMS Pultusk Pultusk was commissioned in 1807 at Antigua under the command of Charles Napier (acting). His promotion to Commander was confirmed on 30 November.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, p.1. Pultusks first campaign was the capture of the Danish islands of St Thomas and Santa Cruz (St. Croix).O'Byrne (1855), p.20. On 15 December arrived at Barbados with the news of war with Denmark. Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane had been in readiness since 2 September and immediately set sail in , together with a squadron including , , , , , , and a number of other vessels including Pultusk. The expedition also included troops from the 70th and 90th Regiments of Foot under the overall army commander, General Henry Boyer. St Thomas surrendered on 22 December and St Croix on 25 December. The British then occupied the Danish West Indies until 20 November 1815, when they returned the islands to Denmark. On 17 July 1808 Napier took two boats from Pultusk to join the three boats from Fawn in a cutting out expedition on the NE end of Port Rico. Lieutenant James Robertson, First Lieutenant of Fawn, was in charge, although Napier outranked Robertson. Napier was only accompanying Robertson to gain a knowledge of the coast and agreed that he would have the status of a volunteer, and that Robertson would be responsible for the operation. The British cut out a Spanish merchant schooner from under the guns of two batteries, and then Robertson and Napier landed and spiked the guns in one battery and rendered the guns' carriages unusable. In August 1808 Napier became captain of the brig-sloop ; his replacement on Pultusk was Commander George Pringle. Pringle took command on 5 August while she was undergoing repairs in English Harbour, Antigua. Once she was ready for sea, Pultusk went to St John's roads, where she took on board a number of French prisoners for Barbados. Her route took her between Deseada and Guadeloupe, where a number of the prisoners were from so there was some concern that the prisoners might try and to seize her. Although there was talk among the prisoners about an attempt, nothing came of it.Pringle (1912), pp353-383. At the end of the year Pultusk carried despatches to Marie-Galante. There she came under the operational control of Captain Hugh Pigot, now in . Pultusk helped enforce the British blockade of Guadeloupe and took several vessels attempting to enter Basse-Terre. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1809 Pultusk participated in the invasion of Martinique. Four decades later the operation was among the actions recognised by the clasp \\"Martinique\\" attached to the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM), awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. One of these vessels Putusk captured while enforcing the blockade was the brig Admiral Decres, which she ran on shore under some batteries. Pringle sent in his boats, which succeeded in refloating her and taking her out. They faced no resistance from Admiral Decres though she was armed as her crew had already fled ashore. Pringle turned her and her cargo of flour, cordage and various articles over to Commander William Dowers in , which had come on the scene after having been in Basse-Terre Bay under a flag of truce. Pringle moved to and Commander David Sloan replaced him on Pultusk. Commander William Elliot replaced Sloan in October. A British squadron under Captain George Miller in arrived at Deshaies on 12 December to reconnoiter the harbour. There they found the French navy's brig Nisus about to leave, having loaded a cargo of coffee. Miller sent in boats with the marines from Thetis, Pultusk, , and , and 78 sailors. The landing party first captured the fort at Deshaies, whereupon Nisus surrendered when its guns were turned on her. During the operation, kept up a six-hour cannonade on Nisus and the battery. Many of the 300 men in the battery fled, as did most of the crew of Nisus before the British could take possession. The British destroyed the battery before withdrawing. British casualties amounted to two men from Thetis being wounded on shore, and two men being wounded on Attentive. The Royal Navy took Nisus into service as HMS Guadeloupe. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp \\"13 Dec. Boat Service 1809\\" to all surviving claimants from the boat action. On 18 December Pultusk brought to Admiral Alexander Cochrane, in at Marie-Galante the news that two of the French frigates that had captured and burned were anchored three leagues NW of the town of Basse-Terre. Cochrane immediately set together with a number of other vessels. There Cochrane found that Captain Samuel James Ballard in Sceptre had a squadron in place and was preparing to attack Seine and Loire, anchored in Anse √† la Barque (\\"Barque Cove\\"). The British attack was successful in that the French abandoned Seine and Loire and set fire to them. Between then and 11 January 1810 Pultusk came under the command of John McGeorge. On that day she was part of a small squadron under Captain Volant Vashon Ballard of Blonde. Ballard sent to capture the 16-gun brig Oreste. Scorpion succeeded in her mission and the Royal Navy took Oreste into service as HMS Wellington. Blonde, Thetis and Pultusk shared in the prize money by agreement. Pultusk then participated in the capture of Guadeloupe. This led to the award in 1847 of the NGSM with clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\". Fate Pultusk was broken up at Antigua later in 1810.

He composed \\"Aegukka\\" ‚Äî the national anthem of the country ‚Äî and \\"Song of General Kim Il-sung\\", in addition to revolutionary operas. Career In his youth, Kim Won-gyun attended high school but dropped out after three grades. After the liberation of Korea, he wrote his first composition: \\"March of Korea\\". Before his musical career, Kim had been only \\"a farmer who just happened to write [the] 'Song of General Kim Il Sung. That was in 1946, very early into the cult of personality of Kim Il- sung; the song was the first work of art that ostensibly mentions Kim Il-sung. After the success of the song, he was asked to compose \\"Aegukka\\". As a musician, he was initially self-taught but went to Moscow in order to study there. At some point he attended a music school in Japan. By 1947, when \\"Aegukka\\" was adapted as the national anthem, he had risen in status. Other compositions by Kim include: \\"Democratic Youth March\\", \\"Our Supreme Commander\\", \\"Glory to the Workers' Party of Korea\\", \\"Sunrise on Mt. Paektu\\", \\"Steel-stong Ranks Advance\\", \\"Song of Great National Unity\\", \\"We Rush Forward in Spirit of Chollima\\", and \\"Song of Anti-Imperialist Struggle\\". Kim is credited with contributing to \\"the creation of the 'Sea of Blood' -type revolutionary operas\\". It is possible that he worked on the operatic version of Sea of Blood and a symphony based on music from the opera. He is also credited with the opera Chirisan. Kim served as a composer to National Art Theatre. He also became the head of the Central Committee of the Korean Musicians Union in 1954, and would later become the vice-president and president of the Union.

Joseph Earl Cherry Mitchell (22 July 1840 - 22 October 1897) was an English-born Australian politician and businessman. He was born in Cheshire to shipbuilder Richard Mitchell and Margaret Cherry. He was his father's apprentice when they arrived in New South Wales in 1859. He then established himself in Newtown as a coal merchant, subsequently becoming a successful figure in the coal industry. In 1866 he married Charlotte Harrison at Bowral; they had eight children. He was a Methodist. Mitchell was elected four times to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. He died at Bellambi in 1897 of cancer.  Business career  Mitchell began as a coal merchant and did much to popularise coal from the Western coalfields around Lithgow. He later acquired interests in collieries and shipping, including a major interest in both the South Bulli Mine and the Bellambi Colliery. From around 1890 up to his death in 1897, Mitchell led efforts to form a syndicate of English capitalists, to set up an iron and steel works, and to win a contract to supply the N.S.W. Government with steel rails. His endeavours were complicated by both the lukewarm support of labour unions‚Äîwho were in favour of a state- owned iron and steel industry in New South Wales‚Äîand the fraudulent efforts of Alfred John Lambert. Unfortunately, although Mitchell eventually won the contract in 1897, he died before he could fulfil it. Although Mitchell had earlier considered the Illawarra as a location for his iron and steel works, the final form of his proposal was that the works were to be sited adjacent to the (former) Pipers Flat railway station, near Wallerawang, and would have exploited nearby deposits of iron ore, limestone and coal. The works were never built.  Political career  Mitchell was first elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1881 as the member for Newtown, but he was defeated the following year. He returned to the Assembly in 1883, but was defeated again in 1885. In 1888 he was elected as a Free Trader and was re- elected for Illawarra in 1889, but he was in Europe at the time of nominations for the 1891 election and therefore was unable to contest. He unsuccessfully contested a by-election later in the same year, and contested Woronora in 1894 and Newtown-Camperdown in 1895, without success. In the early 1880s, political views were in favour of free trade and, generally, in support of the government of Henry Parkes but he was not originally a member of the political grouping led by Parkes. After the Free Trade Party was formed (1887), he stood as a Free Trade Party candidate.

It was ultimately acquired by Linee Aeree Italiane (LAI). ALI was the country's only pre-World War II airline not to be nationalized by the Italian Government.  History  Avio Linee Italiane Fiat G.18 Some sources indicate that ALI began operations in 1926. ALI began passenger service between Rome and Munich in May 1928 and extended service to Berlin in 1931. As of 1931, ALI had a fleet of seven aircraft Fokker F.VII., one F.VIIa and six F.VIIb 3m. During the 1930s, ALI expanded service to other Italian cities, and beginning in 1938, it added at least one international route (Venice-Milan-Turin-Paris-London). As of 1939, ALI had a fleet of 16 aircraft, including one DC-2 (I-EROS),Peter Berry, The Douglas Commercial Story, 1971, p. 19 nine Fiat G.18/G.18V, and six Savoia- Marchetti aircraft (possibly the S.73s).. A 1939 ALI timetable shows a photograph of an S.75, with a caption praising its high speed. However, a S.75 production list does not show an S.75 delivered to ALI. An S.75, I-BETA, listed as belonging to \\"Nucleo Comunicazioni Avio Linee,\\" was lost in an operational accident in 1943, apparently belonged to LATI. In 1940, with the Italian entry into World War II, ALI was incorporated into the Regia Aeronautica (Royal Italian Air Force). At least one S.73 and four G.18 were lost in operational accidents during the war.Aviation Safety Network database, entries for ALI and Nucleo Communicazioni Avio Linee. ALI was reconstituted in 1947, using the Fiat G.12. The airline reportedly ordered six G.212 in 1947, and, at some point, acquired at least one C-47. In 1949, ALI merged with two small post-war Italian independent airlines: Airone (also a Fiat G.12 operator) and Transadriatica, to form ALI - Flotte Riunite, with a combined fleet of seven G.12/G.212s and a dozen C-47s.. Davies writes \\"seven G.12,\\" but the airline had ordered six G.212s two years earlier, so it is probable that the fleet consisted largely of G.212s. The combined airline had an extensive route structure, encompassing Barcelona, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Prague, Vienna, Athens and Brussels. ALI-Flotte Riunite was liquidated in 1952 and subsequently was acquired by LAI.  Notable accidents  The Aviation Safety Network reports four notable peacetime accidents: On 4 May 1949, an ALI G.212CP, registration I-ELCE, on a charter flight carrying the Turin soccer team home from Lisbon, struck a church on approach to the Turin airport, killing four crew members and all 27 passengers.

During World War II, he was with the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. He was a member of the team that built Chicago Pile-1, the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, and was one of those present on December 2, 1942, when it achieved criticality. In July 1945, he was one of the signatories of the Szilard petition. After the war he received his doctorate, and became a researcher at the Argonne National Laboratory from 1947 to 1950, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1951 to 1958, and at University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign from 1958 to 1986, where he pursued the mysteries of the atomic nucleus.  Early life  Albert Wattenberg was born in New York City, New York, on April 13, 1917, the son of Louis and Bella Wattenberg. He had an older brother William (Bill), who helped pioneer the field of educational psychology, as well as a younger brother, Lee, who became a medical researcher. He grew up in New York City, and attended DeWitt Clinton High School, where he helped win the New York math championships. He entered the City College of New York, from which he received his BSc in 1938, and the Columbia University, where he earned his MA in 1939. A politically active student, he organized strikes and a boycott of his own 1938 graduation ceremony in protest against the City College president's Italian Fascist sympathies. After he left Columbia, he took a summer course in spectroscopy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1939, Wattenberg joined Schenley Industries, a distiller of whiskey, where he performed spectroscopic analysis. He joined US Steel in 1940. The consequential increase in salary and reduction in working hours to 30 hours per week enabled him to go back to graduate school at Columbia University to get his PhD. In 1941, his studies were interrupted by World War II. Enrico Fermi asked him to join the group at Columbia working on the nuclear fission of uranium that also included Herbert L. Anderson, Bernard T. Feld, Leo Szilard and Walter Zinn. Wattenberg learned how to build and maintain the Geiger counters and photon and neutron detectors.  Manhattan Project  On 2 December 1946, the fourth anniversary CP-1 going critical, members of the team gathered at the University of Chicago. In the front row is Enrico Fermi, Walter Zinn, Albert Wattenberg and Herbert L. Anderson. Arthur Compton concentrated the teams involved in plutonium and nuclear reactor research at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago at the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in early 1942. There, Wattenberg built and maintained detectors and neutron sources. Indeed, after 1943, he built and maintained all the radium and beryllium neutron sources used by the entire Manhattan Project. He assisted in the construction of Chicago Pile-1, the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, and was one of those present on December 2, 1942, when it achieved criticality. Afterwards, Eugene Wigner opened a bottle of Chianti to celebrate, which those present drank from paper cups. The bottle was signed by those present, and kept as a souvenir by Wattenberg. In 1980, he donated it to the Argonne National Laboratory. In 1943, Wattenberg married Shirley Hier, a graduate of Hunter College. She became an educator and social worker, working as a medical social worker at Cook County Hospital from 1945 to 1947, as an instructor and clinical researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health from 1954 to 1958, and as a caseworker, supervisor, and acting director of Family Services in Champaign, Illinois, from 1959 to 1966. She was an assistant professor at the School of Social Work at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign from 1966 to 1973, and then with its College of Medicine. They had three daughters. After Fermi left the Metallurgical Laboratory for the Los Alamos Laboratory, Wattenberg worked with Leo Szilard. In July 1945, he was one of the signatories of the Szilard petition, which urged that \\"the United States shall not, in the present phase of the war, resort to the use of atomic bombs.\\" His brother Lee aboard a ship, destined to participate in the invasion of Japan. \\"Maybe my brother's alive because we used the atomic bomb\\", he later opined, \\"Maybe the military was right ... I just wish we had tried a demonstration first.\\" In September 1945, soon after the war ended, he became one of the founders of the Federation of Atomic Scientists, the publishers of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.  Later life  The Chianti bottle purchased by Eugene Wigner to help celebrate the first self-sustaining, controlled chain reaction. Wattenberg donated it to the Argonne National Laboratory in 1980. With the war over, Wattenberg returned to his studies, completing his PhD at the University of Chicago under the supervision of Walter Zinn. He wrote his thesis on \\"Photo-neutron sources and the energy of the photo-neutrons\\", and earned his doctorate in 1947. Rather than work in academia, he chose to join Fermi at the Argonne National Laboratory, where he helped design and build nuclear reactors. Wattenberg became director of Argonne's Physics Division in 1949. He did not agree with Zinn's decision, as director of the laboratory, to concentrate on reactor design rather than basic research. By 1950, the rise of McCarthyism led to Wattenberg leaving Argonne, first to go to the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign for a year, and then to MIT, where he remained until 1958. He used MIT's synchrotron to study the properties of nucleons and K-mesons, gaining important insights that would later be incorporated into the standard model. In 1958, he was recruited by the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Although he did do some teaching, he was largely free to work at Argonne and the Brookhaven National Laboratory on his research into K-meson decay. He published a paper with J.J. Sakurai in 1967 about his efforts to distinguish matter from antimatter. He worked on the giant scintillation counters at Fermilab, and directed searches for charm quark s there with photon and neutron beams, and at SLAC using colliding electron-positron beams. Between 1953 and 2003, he was the author of over 115 papers. He retired in 1986. In retirement, Wattenberg became involved with the American Physical Society's Forum of the History of Physics, as a councillor, secretary-treasurer, and editor of the newsletter. He contributed articles to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists about the beginnings of the atomic age and his work assisting Fermi. He co-edited Fermi's papers with Laura Fermi, and participated in celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Enrico Fermi's birth at the University of Chicago in 2001. During the 1980s he was on the executive committee of the Champaign-Urbana chapter of SANE/Nuclear Freeze. He was also a Democratic Party precinct committeeman. He made frequent appearances on Studs Terkel's radio show, and in NPR's All Things Considered, usually on the occasion of the anniversary of Chicago Pile-1 going critical, or of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Wattenberg's wife Shirley died in 1989. In 1992, he married Alice Wyers von Neumann, a social worker. He died at Clark-Lindsey Village in Urbana, Illinois, on June 27, 2007. He was survived by his wife Alice, daughters Beth, Jill and Nina, and his brother Lee.

The Annals of Ulster describe \\"Albann\\", a figure usually identified with Halfdan Ragnarsson, a leader of the Great Heathen Army, as king of the \\"dark heathens\\", and Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib identifies B√°rid mac √çmair, King of Dublin as the leader of the \\"fair heathens\\". All accounts agree Halfdan was killed in the battle, and Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib adds that B√°rid was wounded in it. Background Sometime in the 850s or 860s the three Viking brothers √çmar, Amla√≠b Conung and Auisle began to rule as kings in Dublin.√ì Corrain (1998), p. 28-29 √çmar died in 873, Amla√≠b in 874, and Auisle in 867; with B√°rid, son of √çmar probably succeeding them as king.Downham, p. 24, 28 Some scholars have also suggested that Oistin, son of Amla√≠b ruled with B√°rid as co-king.Sigur√∞sson and Bolton, p. 36-37 According to some scholars Halfdan Ragnarsson was brother to √çmar, Amla√≠b Conung and Auisle, and hence uncle to B√°rid and Oistin.Downham, p. 16 Halfdan is not described as ruling in Ireland like his brothers in any contemporary source, but he is instead described as one of the leaders of the Great Heathen Army which invaded the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England from 865 onwards.Venning, p. 132 Halfdan is identified by some as a brother of the three kings of Dublin because in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle he is described as the brother of another leader of the Great Heathen Army named √çvarr. This √çvarr is often considered the same as √çmar, primarily because √çmar is absent from Irish records during the period √çvarr is described as a leader of the Great Heathen Army.√ì Corrain (1979), p. 314-323 According to the later Norse sagas Halfdan was the son of the legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok, but the historicity of Ragnar is uncertain and the identification of Ragnar as the father of Halfdan is not to be relied upon.Costambeys The main historical sources for this period are the Norse sagas and the Irish annals. Some of the annals, such as the Annals of Ulster are believed to be contemporary accounts, whereas the sagas were written down at dates much later than the events they describe and are considered far less reliable. A few of the annals such as the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland and the Annals of the Four Masters were also complied at later dates, in part from more contemporary material and in part from fragments of sagas.Radner, pp. 322-325 According to Downham: \\"apart from these additions [of saga fragments], Irish chronicles are considered by scholars to be largely accurate records, albeit partisan in their presentation of events\\".Downham, p. 12 Battle The Annals of Ulster record a battle taking place in 877: According to South \\"there is now general agreement that Halfdan [Ragnarson] is identical with Albann\\".South, p. 87 Albann is mentioned only one in other time in the annals; in 875 he is named as the killer of Oistin mac Amla√≠b, possible co-king of Dublin.Downham, p. 238 Assuming Albann and Halfdan to be the same person, and assuming Halfdan to be the brother of √çmar, this makes Oistin's death nepoticide. Downham suggests this familial connection indicates a motive for the murder; it was part of a dynastic squabble for control of the kingdom.Downham, p. 68 Downham also suggests the squabble continued until 877, of which the battle described by the Annals of Ulster was the culmination. The Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib expands on the Annals of Ulster account: In this account Halfdan is to be identified with \\"Ragnall's son\\". However, this is problematic since in the Fragmentary Annals the name of √çmar, Amla√≠b, and Auisle's father is Gofraid, not Ragnall.Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, ¬ß 400 It is possible Ragnall is simply a rendering of Ragnar, meaning Ragnar Lodbrok, who is named as Halfdan's father in the later (and more historically dubious) sagas.Saga Book of the Viking Society for Northern Research, p. 86, note 1 Notes References Citations Primary sources  * Accessed via Internet Archive.

His involvement in funding and directing various violent fascist organizations throughout Northern Greece, and especially Thessaloniki, was uncovered by examining magistrate Christos Sartzetakis and Mitsou was jailed, prompting the fall of the conservative Karamanlis government. Life Konstantinos Mitsou was born in 1909 in the village of Halkiopoulo in Aetolia-Acarnania. His father, Vasileios Mitsou, was a wealthy and conservative farmer and landowner. Mitsou first served in the Hellenic Army as a sergeant of Infantry, but in 1932 he joined the Hellenic Gendarmerie. From 1946 until 1949, he served in the VIP Security Directorate of the Gendarmerie, and was head of security for King Paul during his early reign. From 1950 until 1953 he was commander of Gendarmerie for the Magnesia region, and from 1953 until 1955 commander of Gendarmerie for the Serres region, where he met and befriended future Prime Minister Constantine Karamanlis. He then served as Gendarmerie commander for the island of Crete (1955‚Äì58) and for the city of Thessaloniki (1958‚Äì61). In July 1961 he was appointed General Inspector of Gendarmerie for Northern Greece, in charge of all Gendarmerie forces in the north of the country. In May 1963, after the assassination of Lambrakis, his role in supporting violent far-right groups was uncovered by examining magistrate Christos Sartzetakis. He died in 1985 in Thessaloniki. Portrayal Mitsou, played by French actor Pierre Dux, is the main antagonist in the celebrated Costa Gavras political thriller Z, where he is only referred to as \\"the General\\".

He was a major influence on literature in the Appalachian region. Biography Early years Jim Wayne Miller was born on October 21, 1936, in Leicester, North Carolina, to James Woodward Miller and Edith (Smith) Miller.Every Leaf a Mirror. Morris Allen Grubbs and Mary Ellen Miller, eds. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2014. Print. He was raised with five brothers and sisters on a seventy-acre farm in North Turkey Creek, in Buncombe County, about fifteen miles west of Asheville. His father was a service manager at a Firestone Complete Auto Care in Asheville. Education and career Jim Wayne Miller graduated from Berea College in Kentucky in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in English. He had studied abroad in Minden, Westphalia, Germany, the summer before his junior year on a homestay scholarship awarded by the Experiment in International Living. Upon graduation, he found work as a teacher of German and English in Fort Knox, Kentucky. In 1960 Miller received an NDEA Fellowship, making it possible for him to pursue graduate studies at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He earned his Ph.D. in German literature there in 1965, completing a dissertation on the German poet Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff. From 1960 to 1963, he published regularly in Vanderbilt's literary magazine, Vagabond. By 1963, he had already joined the faculty at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, sixty miles north of Nashville. While at Vanderbilt he studied under Fugitive poet Donald Davidson and Hawthorne Scholar Randall Stewart. He was a Professor of German language and literature at Western Kentucky University for 33 years, in the faculty of the Department of Modern Languages and Intercultural Studies. He served as consultant to Appalachian Studies programs in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio and was Visiting Professor in Appalachian Studies at the Berea College Appalachian Center. Miller was promoted to associate professor of German at Western Kentucky University in 1966 and to full professor in 1970. In 1969 Sigma Tau Delta honored him for excellence in teaching, and in 1976 Western Kentucky University presented him with the University Faculty Award for scholarship and creativity. Berea College awarded him with the honorary degree of Doctor of Literature in 1981. While on sabbatical in Germany in 1972, Miller met Austrian poet Emil Lerperger. Miller would later translate a volume of his poetry and also become his literary executor. In 1977, Miller began his affiliation with the Poet-in- the-Schools Program in Virginia Public Schools. The following year, he began his long association with the Hindman Settlement School Appalachian Writers' Workshop. In 2015, following the publication of A Jim Wayne Miller Reader, the Appalachian Writers' Workshop honored the memory of Jim Wayne Miller by highlighting his work through lectures and book promotions. In his brief biography of Jim Wayne Miller for Appalachian Heritage, George Brosi writes that Miller \\"is quite simply an icon in the field of Appalachian Literature-- one of its earliest and most ardent supporters.\\" Among his many projects for the advancement of Appalachian literature was his editing of ten books by Jesse Stuart for re-issue by the Jesse Stuart Foundation. Miller was elected chair of the Appalachian Studies Association in 1982. The same year, he received the Western Kentucky University Award for public service. For two years, beginning in 1984, he was visiting professor at the James R. Stokely Institute for Liberal Arts Education at the University of Tennessee. He also served as poet-in-residence at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. Personal life Miller married Mary Ellen Yates, a classmate at Berea College, on August 17, 1958. After graduation, they moved to Fort Knox, Kentucky, where Miller taught English and German at a school on the military base. In 1960, they moved to Nashville, Tennessee. They settled in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where they raised three children. Mary pursued graduate work at the University of Kentucky, where she earned a master's degree in English, and then her Ph.D. work at Vanderbilt University, supported by Miller's faculty position at Western Kentucky University. Eventually, she also landed a tenure-track job at Western Kentucky University, in the Department of English. She is now Professor of English and has taught at the university for 51 years. Mary Ellen Miller is the author of a book of poems, The Poet's Wife Speaks (2011). Jim Wayne Miller was diagnosed with lung cancer in June 1996. He died at home on August 18. Writing Miller is best known as a poet. In his work, he is centrally concerned with the preservation of the Appalachian cultural heritage in the modern world. His writing reflects his own experiences in the mountain South. He invents the figure of the Brier as an Appalachian Everyman, a voice for those voiceless people who are struggling to maintain their connection to a meaningful past. As Joyce Dyer writes, \\"In his poetry he explores the meaning of his own Appalachian experience, but always places it within a broader regional and national consciousness.\\" Miller wrote satirical essays, articles about Appalachian history and culture, translations, reviews, editions of work by Jesse Stuart, anthologies, and fiction. In his satire, Miller attacks destructive social forces such as American consumerism. He also strives to show that the American South is a diverse place‚Äîand specifically that the mountain South is distinct from the lowland South. Miller made the following observation about his aim as a poet, according to Annette Hadley and Matthew Farrell of The Southern Highlands Research Center: \\"Growing up in North Carolina, I was often amused, along with other natives, at tourists who fished the trout streams. The pools, so perfectly clear, had a deceptive depth. Fishermen unacquainted with them were forever stepping into what they thought was knee-deep water and going in up to their waists or even their armpits, sometimes being floated right off their feet. I try to make poems like those pools, so simple and clear their depth is deceiving. I want the writing to be so transparent that the reader forgets he is reading and is aware only that he is having an experience. He is suddenly plunged deeper than he expected and comes up shivering.\\" Poet Robert Morgan praised Miller's first book of poetry, Copperhead Cane (1964), in these terms: \\"These poems shine as brightly as if they were written this morning. They do not reflect the fashions of 1965, but have a timeless, crafted quality. They have the authority of form and the authority of felt experience. They are authentic in detail and natural in speech.\\" Miller was one of the editors of Appalachia Inside Out, a two-volume anthology of Appalachian literature that demonstrates the richness of the culture and imaginative worlds of writers from the mountain South. He received several awards for his novel Newfound (1989), including the Best Book of the Year citation from Learning Magazine and Best Book of the Year from Booklist. Documentary film In 1985 Western Kentucky University produced a thirty-minute documentary film on the life and poetry of Jim Wayne Miller. Called \\"I Have a Place: The Poetry of Jim Wayne Miller.\\" It is directed by Michael Lasater, a new media artist now on the Arts faculty at Indiana University South Bend. The film won a Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival. It was broadcast on PBS stations.

Early life Bandt was born the eldest of five children in the South Australian town of Moonta. The family moved to Adelaide after World War I, and in 1924 he began a fitting and turning apprenticeship with Duncan & Fraser Ltd who specialised in modifying Model T Fords. He moved to Victoria in 1927 and worked for the Melbourne Motor Body & Assembling Company. In 1929 he moved to the Ford factory in Geelong as the subsidiary's first designer. Ute design The design of the ute was a result of a 1932 letter from an unnamed Victorian farmer's wife asking for \\"a vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays\\". In response, Bandt developed the ute and the model called a \\"coupe utility\\" at the time was released in 1934. When the Australian version was displayed in the US, Henry Ford nicknamed it the \\"Kangaroo Chaser\\". A convertible version, known as the roadster utility was produced in limited numbers by Ford in the 1930s.http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/history/history.html Later career During World War II, Bandt helped to design long-range fuel tanks for Spitfire and Thunderbolt fighter planes. He also worked on design innovations for the UK-sourced Ford Zephyr, the 1967 Australian Ford Fairlane, and the never- approved Falcon convertible, of which six were built outside Ford in 1962. Personal life Bandt married Nellie Rowe on 6 September 1941. He was a lifelong member of the Methodist (later Uniting) Church. He was known for his charity work. Lewis and Nellie had three daughters: Sylvia, Val and Ros. Later in life he also had four grandchildren: Brad, Tate, Eden and Joe. He was an accomplished artist, and painted Ford‚Äôs nativity scene at Christmas. He retired in 1975. Death Bandt was killed on 18 March 1987, while coming home from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation television studios where he had been recording a documentary about the ute. He was driving a 1934 model home when he collided with a truck near Bannockburn. He was survived by his wife and three daughters. In 2008, the Lewis Bandt Bridge was opened and named in his honour.

Early life  John Thomas Playfair, known as Thomas Playfair, the eldest son of tailor Thomas Playfair and Mary Anne, n√©e Arnold, was baptised on 12 February 1832 in Essex, England. He went to sea at the age of twelve, becoming a captain's steward in the Royal Navy. In 1859 he settled in Sydney, entering into a partnership with wholesale butcher E. J. Baily, also operating a separate business as a shipping butcher at 103 George Street, The Rocks. On 7 November 1860 he married Ellen Matheson, with whom he had three sons. After her death in 1866, he married her sister, Georgina Hope, on 26 February 1867; they had a daughter and two sons.  Career  Following the death of E. J. Baily, Playfair continued the business partnership with his widow. The ship's providore venture grew into a prosperous enterprise. Playfair was a Sydney City Councillor, representing Gipps Ward continuously from 1875 to 1893. His achievements during his time in the Council include the widening of George Street North and the erection of new cattle sale-yards at Homebush. Serving as Mayor of Sydney in 1885, he pledged to \\"improve the homes of the poor, and clear out the dark places of the city\\". In 1889 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as a Free Trade member for West Sydney, serving only one term before his defeat in 1891.  Personal life  Playfair was a generous benefactor to several charities, including the Sydney Ragged School, the Sisters of St Joseph's Providence and the Boys' Brigade. Playfair died at his home in Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross on 15 November 1893, following an attack of rheumatic gout. He was interred in the Church of England section of Waverley Cemetery. His estate, which included approximately thirty properties in the City, Eastern Suburbs, North Sydney and Manly, was divided between his four surviving children, Thomas Arnold, Edmund John Baily, Jessie and Alfred Donald. The butchering business was bequeathed to Edmund.  Legacy / Memorials  Playfair Street and Playfair Stairs, both located in The Rocks, are named after Thomas Playfair. The Playfair Memorial Drinking Fountain was installed at the Flemington sale-yards in May 1896, in recognition of Playfair's efforts to modernise Sydney's water supply. The fountain was moved to Sydney Olympic Park on 1 March 1968. A plaque was placed on the doors of Holy Trinity Church in Millers Point in 1960 in his memory.

With the establishment of the penal colony at Ross Island, the British administration made it the administrative headquarters for the entire group of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and built bungalows and other facilities on the site. This colony was meant as \\"manageable models of colonial governance and rehabilitation\\". The Chief Commissioner's residence was located at the highest point on the island. Over time, several other islands including Chatham and Viper were used for the penal colony. The penal colony became infamous as \\"Kalapani\\" or \\"black water\\" for the brutalities inflicted by the British authorities on the political prisoners from India, and most of whom had died by 1860 due to illness and torture suffered during the initial stages of the clearance of the forest to establish the colony. In later years the colony experimented for a short time with civilizing the indigenous people of Andamans. The penal colony was used as an experimental station for various methods of torture and medical tests. During World War II, the island was invaded by the Japanese army, forcing the British to evacuate. The administrative buildings were destroyed but the penal colony remained. After the Allied forces reoccupied the island the penal colony was disbanded on 7 October 1945. Geography Ross Island in 2004 Ross Island (now known as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island), one of the islands chosen for establishing the penal colony, is located near the entrance to the harbour at Port Blair in South Andamans. It is a small island which has a circumference of only. The penal colonies were initially located on Ross, Chatham and Viper Islands. Viper Island was meant for the most dangerous prisoners. By 1871, it included Perseverance Point, Hopetown, Command Point, Mount Harriet, South Point, Aberdeen, Haddo, Navy Bay and Port Mouat, twelve stations in all. Once called \\"Paris of the East\\" for its exciting social life and tropical forests, the island was devastated by the invading army of the Japanese and also by an earthquake which had struck the island in 1941, and it now appears more like a \\"jungle-clad Lost City.\\" History The earliest known effort to establish a penal colony was by Archibald Blair who found the remoteness of the island as ideal for such a colony. But his initiative failed to go beyond 1796 as malaria prevented it. The First War of Indian Independence in 1857 rekindled the interest of the British Administration in India to establish a penal colony in the Andaman Islands for political prisoners. The first group of 200 prisoners were transported under the control of Dr James Pattison Walker from Calcutta. Deportees included many prominent leaders of the Wahabi movement (an Islamic \\"reform movement\\") and the subsequent revolution.) The prisoners landed at the Andaman Islands on 10 March 1858. Walker soon put the convicts on the arduous task of clearing the dense forest of Ross Island, building their own shelters and other buildings, and laying roads. The prisoners were chained and collared around the neck with identity tags, and were in a poor state of health. In the beginning there were no basic amenities. During the rainy season they had to live in tents. In November 1858 temporary barrack- type huts with walls made of mats and with leaking thatched roofs provided accommodation for about 1,000 prisoners. At one stage, of the 8,000 prisoners who had been transported to the islands under the penal project, 3,500 had died due to sickness. Sir Robert Napier, who came to Port Blair to investigate, found the conditions \\"beyond comprehension\\" as there was no food, clothing and shelter provided to the convicts. However, Ross Island was comparatively a better place than in the earlier initial years as Colonel RC Tytler and his wife Harriet had improved the facilities for the community. Tytler had been posted as Superintendent of the Convict Settlement, also known as the \\"British gulag\\", from April 1862 to February 1864. He tried to improve the conditions at the camp, where the death rate of the prisoners was 700 per year. At that time the doctors at the camp reported that only 45 prisoners out of the 10,000 were considered medically fit. According to reports in the 1870s, intense rain, malaria, pneumonia and dysentery caused many deaths. During this time the authorities also embarked on testing of pharmaceutical drugs like quinine (cinchona alkaloid) by forcibly feeding it to 10,000 prisoners which resulted in severe side effects such as nausea, diarrhea and depression; as result the prisoners started injuring each other so that authorities would hang them. Instead, a new system of \\"flogging and a reduced diet\\" was introduced and they were made to sleep in a kind of \\"trellis-work cage\\". The prisoners also faced hardships from the indigenous tribes, some of whom were cannibals, who tortured and killed them while working in the field, and also attacked the colony. In 1891, there were 12,197 convicts who had been exported from British India. Some of the convicts who were freed were engaged in agriculture, and those who were forced to do service were given monetary compensation of US$25 per month. However, even then escape from the penal colony was impossible and any escapee who tried was killed. At the beginning of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at the penal colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. He suggested that after due care and adequate security had been put in place the convicts of the penal colony could be shifted to the mainland in small boats. From the time of its establishment in 1858 till it was disbanded on 7 October 1945, the penal colony was administered by 24 Chief Commissioners. This deserted fortress is now a tourist attraction. Notable events Four days after their first landing on the island, one of the convicts, Narain, who had been convicted for sedition, tried to escape but was caught and shot dead. Another prisoner, Naringun Singh, who was a deserter, committed suicide by hanging. When 81 out of the 288 inmates tried to escape they were savagely attacked by the aboriginal people of Andamans which made them turn back to the prison camp seeking medical help. However, all of them were summarily put to death by hanging in one single day. JP Grant, President in Council in Calcutta complained to the higher authorities, but Walker was not reprimanded; instead, he put the convicts at the Penal Colony into an \\"iron collar\\" to prevent them from escape. Finally, on 3 October 1859 he was removed from the penal settlement as he had suggested branding the convicts on their forearms with information of the crime and sentence that they had been given. On 23 April 1858, out of the 91 escapees one person who was saved by the Andamanese people was Dudnath Tiwari, a political prisoner. He was absorbed into the aboriginal culture, married two of their girls, and learned their language. However, when the Andamanese were on the verge of mounting a massive attack on the penal colony on 16 May 1859, he ran away and secretly conveyed this information to the Superintendent. The aboriginals attacked the camp with bows and arrows but were completely routed by the superior weapons of the British. This battle came to be known as the \\"Battle of Aberdeen\\", the first initiative by the local tribals who did not like the British officers or the convicts. This resulted in change of approach by the British to handle the local people: steps were initiated to seek peace with them and a British officer was appointed to look after their welfare. A notable incident that occurred was the assassination of Lord Mayo, the Viceroy of India who had visited the islands on an inspection tour. He had visited the Ross Island penal settlement. The attack on Lord Mayo was carried out by Sher Ali, one of the convicts of the penal colony who was on a sick leave; the assassination was carried out while Mayo was returning after a pleasant trip to Mount Harriet on the evening of 8 February 1872. Another political prisoner who suffered the longest period of 47 years of incarceration was Musai Singh who was released for good behavior in July 1907 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of India's First War of Independence in 1857. Fazal Haq Khairabadi, a renowned poet and intellectual in the Mughal court, a friend of Urdu poet Ghalib and a mentor of David Ochterlony, was accused of inflaming the Muslims of Delhi to wage \\"jihad\\" against the British Raj during the First War of Independence. He refused to plead not guilty and seek amnesty, and was thus transported to the penal colony. He was at the penal colony from 8 October 1859 till his death in 1861. His son made efforts to have his father released but could only take part in his father's funeral at Port Blair. One of the notable actions Khairabadi did while in the penal colony was to write on the details of the First War of Independence and his experience of the \\"Kalapani\\", using charcoal sticks and rags of cloth; these were later published in Arabic as Al-Surat-ul Hindia and Al-Fitnat-ul-Hindia. Ross Island Penal Colony was the inspiration for Rura Penthe, the penal colony island in the 1954 Disney film 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

It was built from 1841 to 1914. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Homestead at Cressbrook Station, 1930 Cressbrook Homestead was constructed as the head station of the Cressbrook Run which was taken up by the McConnel family in 1841. David Cannon McConnel arrived in Sydney from Britain in February 1840 where he purchased sheep and started searching for a suitable pastoral lease. His search took him northward to the Moreton Bay region recently opened for selection after the closure of the penal colony. After this event, many eager British immigrants, including the Leslie Brothers, Wickham, the Bigge Brothers and John Balfour were selecting land in the Moreton Bay area. McConnel pressed northward past the rich Darling Downs into the Brisbane River Valley which became the next centre of pastoral development after land on the Darling Downs was fully selected. The Brisbane River Valley was explored by both Cunningham and Patrick Logan in the late 1820s and many squatters took up land in the early 1840s. On 15 July 1841 David McConnel took up 240 square miles of land in the Valley, with the Brisbane River and a creek running through. David McConnel was the son of James McConnel who founded a machine making company in Manchester after which, in 1835, he became the owner of the long established and Cressbrook Mill in Derbyshire where lace thread was produced. It was here that the McConnels established their family home and it was to commemorate this place that David McConnel named his Australian property and the creek running through the property. Within one year, Francis and Frederic Bigge established the adjoining Mount Brisbane Station and six months after this John Balfour took up land on the other side of Cressbrook for his station, Colinton. McConnel established Cressbrook as a sheep farm but found the land more suitable for Shorthorn cattle which were introduced by 1845. He constructed a timber slab house in 1841 but because the location was deemed unsuitable another two- roomed slab house was constructed with verandah overlooking the Brisbane River to the north. Two Bunya pine trees were planted by McConnel at the west end of this verandah. The slab hut and one of the Bunya pines survives to this day; the hut now forming the eastern wing of the principal house. David McConnel returned to Britain in 1847 where he married Mary McLeod of Edinburgh on 25 April 1847. Mary's parents were against the pair returning to Australia and therefore the newly weds settled in Nottinghamshire, though financial difficulties at Cressbrook, which had been left in the hands of managers, necessitated their return in 1849. They returned aboard Chaseley, one of the three boats chartered by the Rev. Dr. John Dunmore Lang for the transport of Presbyterians to the new colony of Queensland. Having arrived, David and Mary McConnel settled in Brisbane, establishing the house, Toogoolawah (now known as Bulimba House). On 1 January 1851 David McConnel's brother, John McConnel, joined in partnership with his brother and they purchased Durundur Station, previously belonging to the Archers, who moved to the Burnett region. In 1851 the McConnels owned 400 cattle and 10,000 sheep on both of the Brisbane River Valley properties. David McConnel returned to England with his seriously ill wife in 1854 and they did not return to Cressbrook until 1862, when the partnership between David and John McConnel was dissolved with John McConnel taking exclusive rights at Durundur and David maintaining the ownership of Cressbrook. Upon David and Mary's return to Cressbrook extensive alterations were made to the slab hut, which was from an early date known as the House, to distinguish it from the Cottage which was built nearby. This addition to the House comprised the construction of a timber section, two storeyed in part and generally larger in scale than the wing to which it was abutted. A kitchen wing, another timber slab building, was added to the south of the House. As well another residence was constructed at Cressbrook, the previously mentioned Cottage which was built further west of the House and overlooking the Brisbane River and adjacent flood plain. The Cottage was unusual as it was a timber framed building with brick nogging. Although few records exist to suggest who built this or when, the peculiarly German method of construction suggests that there may have been a German influence, and it is known that David McConnel could speak German. The building was thought to have been constructed in the 1860s and was used as a residence for various farm managers and, later, the families of McConnel children. This construction work brought many people to the station, \\"splitters, sawyers, carpenters, builders, bricklayers\\". Along with the farmhands and managers, these additional people created a small township at Cressbrook and attempts were made by the McConnels to establish a school for the children, one of the first in the Brisbane River Valley, and a library for the men in one of the rooms of the Cottage. Weekly Presbyterian church services were held in the recently constructed addition to the House. Mary McConnel and her daughter, also Mary, wrote memoirs about Cressbrook, describing the buildings, gardens and generally the life on the station. Younger Mary's recollection of the Cottage includes, \\"Through the hand-gate in front of the entrance porch (of the House) was a small paddock which divided the House from the Cottage; it had swings and a few silky oaks. The Cottage was of brick with a steep shingled roof; two or three gentlemen...were lodged under the efficient charge of a Scottish working-housekeeper\\". She continues on to describe living on the verandah of the House, > Indoor occupation was varied and constant. One says indoor ‚Äì yet it was > carried out for the most part on the wide verandah, shaded from the sun by > blinds. These came from Java or Japan; they were made of long strips of cane > painted green and rolled up in the evening by cords on small pulleys. On the > verandah peaches were stoned for jam, oranges peeled for marmalade and > quinces carefully paired and cored for jelly. There was a wide table where > the many kerosene lamps were washed and trimmed every morning and set ready > to be carried to their respective rooms at night. There was the > indispensable treadle sewing machine, and in a cool corner, in a draught, > stood a filter with a tap and a tin pannikin, near it a large porous water- > jar swathed in damp flannel for evaporation. Witton House, in the grounds of Tighnabruaich, a residence in Indooroopilly, circa 1932 In 1873 David Cannon McConnel retired from managing Cressbrook and one of his sons, James Henry (Henry) assumed responsibility. David and Mary moved to Witton Manor at Indooroopilly on the Brisbane River, which was later moved to the Tighnabruaich house site, and is now demolished. From her new situation in Brisbane, Mary McConnel was influential in establishing one of the first children's hospitals in Australia, the Hospital for Sick Children in Brisbane, which was opened on 11 March 1878. Soon after this on 16 June 1885, David died in London where he had gone to have an operation. In 1877, were resumed from the Cressbrook pastoral run and offered for selection on 17 April 1877. A partnership had been formed previously which saw Cressbrook owned by a company formed by David and his four sons, Henry, David Rose, Eric Walter and Edward John and their sister Mary McLeod Banks (n√©e McConnel). This company, without David, continued to run Cressbrook for many years after his death. Through the 1880s Government resumptions of land for closer settlement reduced the Cressbrook holding until it was about 4 and 3/4 square miles. In 1890 a condensed milk factory was established on the Cressbrook run by Henry McConnel and milk for this was supplied by a dairy at Cressbrook and many other surrounding farms, carved from the Cressbrook property, of which there were about thirty by 1910. The milk factory was sold, with , being about four farms, to the Nestles Anglo-Swiss Company in 1906, as finances continued in an unsettled way with the dissolution of the partnership and the purchase, by Henry McConnel of the Cressbrook Homestead and some surrounding the residences and outbuildings by December 1907. In 1901 a timber chapel, designed by renowned architect Robin Smith Dods was constructed, to the west of the principal residences and on a prominent position as one entered the property. The chapel was ecumenical, serving the religions of all creeds of the station workers and was built to commemorate the silver wedding anniversary of Henry and Madge McConnel. This was one of Dods' early ecclesiastical buildings, later he designed several other timber churches and chapels including Saint Andrews Anglican Church (1912) nearby at Toogoolawah, as well as many prominent masonry buildings as the Anglican Diocesan Architect. In about 1914, after the death of Henry, his wife organised for alterations to the House also designed by Dods, integrating the disparate verandahs lining the northern face of the building, with a large open pavilion, as well as some internal work. A detailed plan of Cressbrook in 1910 was prepared by Kenneth McConnel for a publication by him, Planning the Australian Homestead (Ure Smith, Sydney, 1947). This details all of the buildings and structures within the vicinity of the principal residences and shows this area as a small township which included numerous outbuildings and homes for workers and their families. Provision was made for bachelors' quarters, married men's quarters, single men's quarters, a school house, chapel, various stores and shops along with stables, killing shed, milking baths, bull stables, hay shed, wagon shed and draft stables and cattle dip. Of these structures and buildings, many survive including two large tank stands, the draft stables, an explosives store, parts of the cattle dip, one of the bachelors' quarters and one of the married men's quarters. Cressbrook continues through the twentieth century as a working pastoral station in the hands of the McConnel family.  Description  Cressbrook Homestead comprises a number of buildings, structures and garden elements which are significant. The buildings include the principal house, known as the House with outbuildings, a secondary house, known as the Cottage, a timber chapel; an early stables; an explosives store; dairy complex, various animal shelters and two small residences. The site is accessed along a gravel driveway which leads east into the complex over a small timber bridge. The House and Cottage are located to the north of the property overlooking the Brisbane River and adjacent river flats. The chapel, to the west of the Cottage, is one of the first buildings encountered on the approach to the complex. Various outbuildings extend to the east of the House, with the dairy complex at the extreme east of the listing boundary and other buildings on the south of the approach road.  The House  The House comprises some of the oldest buildings at Cressbrook, including an 1840s slab wing. The buildings forming the house are arranged such that the principal sections face northward and overlook the Brisbane River, with the kitchen wing and outbuildings forming a courtyard to the rear, southern side of the complex. Specifically, the House comprises two vertical slab wings at right angles to one another and joined by a two storeyed corner section. To the rear of this large principal building are two smaller timber buildings, which complete a courtyard. The corner section of the principal building, joining the two slab wings is a timber framed residence, clad with horizontal chamfered boards, single storeyed with a loft in the roof space. The building is clad with a corrugated iron gabled roof, the gabled ends on the northern and southern ends of the buildings. The pitch of the roof changes from being steep over the central core to a shallower pitch over the former verandah spaces. Two brick chimneys with corbelled tops project above the roof line. The entrance elevation of this building faces west and has a centrally located recessed entrance to which access is provided through an adjacent arbor formed by vine on a timber and mesh trellis. Extending from the entrance door recess into the arbor is a timber boarded platform. The six panelled cedar entrance door is flanked by two long narrow rectangular window openings. On the north elevation, overlooking the Brisbane River, this section of the house is lined with a verandah at the eastern end of which, the verandah expands to form an open pavilion space with hipped roof. This pavilion serves to connect the verandahs of this section and the two slab wings of the House. The verandah awning and pavilion roof are lined with fibrous cement ceilings braced with timber cover strips and the whole is supported on rectangular planned columns which taper towards the top. Simple timber dowel balustrading links the columns. Remnants of bamboo blinds painted cream and dark green in thin vertical strips, have been uncovered in recent maintenance work. The interior of this section of the House is largely constructed from unpainted timber boarding, mostly red cedar though some of the ceilings in the internal rooms have been painted. Internally this section of the house is arranged around a central corridor running from the entrance on the east, parallel to the verandah on the north, to another door on the verandah on the east. The hall is divided to form an entrance vestibule on its western end by square planned timber columns, with mouldings articulating the base, body and capital of the columns. The verandah along the western side of the building was infilled and rooms have been formed along this side, with access provided to them from the entrance vestibule. These rooms retain the sloping ceiling of the early verandah. The main hallway, from the entrance area, provides access to four rooms, which have a variety of internal timber cladding; wide vertical beaded boards and wide horizontal boards. Each of these four rooms have been fitted with a red cedar fireplace. On the southern external wall of this section of the House is a straight timber stair leading to the loft area which runs centrally above the house, terminating in a small balcony on the northern elevation. The balcony is detailed with columns and balustrading similar to that of the ground floor verandah and pavilion. The wing extending eastward, parallel to the Brisbane River, is a timber building constructed from vertical slabs with a hipped corrugated iron roof with shallower pitch over the verandahs which run along the north and south facades. The vertical timber slabs which make up the external walls are chamfered at the ends and fitted within beaded top and bottom plates and interspersed among the slabs are vertical uprights of sawn timber. Internally this wing is divided into three main rooms, with smaller rooms created on the infilled verandah along the southern side. Openings from this wing include French doors and sliding six-pane windows. The wing extending southward from the main house, the kitchen wing is constructed similarly to the eastward reaching wing, but with sawn vertical slabs. The steeply pitched corrugated iron roof of this wing changes pitch to form verandah awnings. A substantial brick chimney extends from the southern end of the wing. There are five other timber buildings in the precinct of the House. A small asymmetrical cottage clad with horizontal boards and with a gable corrugated iron roof is situated forming the eastern boundary of the courtyard and has three rooms and a verandah facing the courtyard. To the east of this is a small but high one roomed single skinned and externally framed and braced building with a gabled corrugated iron roof and several unglazed window openings. Forming the southern boundary of the courtyard is another small two roomed building clad with vertical boards and with several sliding window openings. To the west of the southern wing of the House is another small timber cottage, clad with horizontal timber board. One of the most prominent elements of the House precinct is a large Bunya Pine tree. This tree is located adjacent to the pavilion space on the verandah and is one of the oldest trees on the site.  The Cottage  The Cottage, Cressbrook, overlooking the Brisbane River The main section of the Cottage has a steeply pitched corrugated iron roof which becomes shallower at the line of the external walls, demarcating the verandah. To this roof a narrow corrugated iron awning is supported on slender timber brackets attached to the verandah posts on the northern elevation and on slender posts on the southern and eastern. Beneath the corrugated iron of the main roof an intact timber shingled roof survives. The early part of the Cottage, at the eastern end of the present building, is constructed with a timber frame and brick nogging. This early structure has been lined with horizontal timber chamfered boarding, possibly when the western room was added which is timber framed and clad with similar chamfered boards. Sections of brick nogging have been left uncovered on the upper external walls. Entrance to the cottage is through a small gabled awning on the south facing elevation which is supported on columns and identifies the place of entrance through the verandah. This small awning is emphasised by the placement of two substantial face brick chimney shafts projecting from the roof on this southern side symmetrically arranged on either side of the entrance, at the line on the roof where the pitch changes to accommodate the verandah. The buildings at the western end of the Cottage are timber framed and clad with horizontal timber boards. Between these additions and the Cottage is an open concreted floor shelter space which is joined to the verandahs. An open extension used as a shelter for cars extends from the south of the Cottage, and consists of a corrugated iron gabled roof supported on timber posts. As with the buildings forming the House precinct, the Cottage generally has sliding six paned window openings and French doors opening onto verandahs. From the entrance vestibule access is given to the infilled verandah flanking this area, and, to the north, access is provided to two of the principal three rooms of the house. One of these rooms, located centrally within the house has a large bay window opening onto the northern facing verandah. This extends with a rectangular plan into the verandah and houses four full length vertical sash windows which are framed in a timber structure of about high and features shallow timber pilasters and the structure is surmounted by an entablature. Internally the older sections of the Cottage have lath and plaster walls and ceilings, timber floors, and some original joinery. The upper parts of the walls taper in towards the room as they reach the ceiling. Chimney breasts are found in two of the early rooms, and towards the ceiling these taper outward. Remnants of early wall paper survive in several of the rooms, and efforts have been made by the present owners to repaper one of the rooms with a reconstructed paper. Between the Cottage and the House is an early tennis court, which survives intact with boundary fencing, posts, surfacing and planting. Near the tennis court is a large and early set of two swings, supported on timber posts.  The Chapel  Cressbrook Homestead church and cemetery, 2010 Church entrance, Cressbrook Homestead, 2010 Church entrance detail, Cressbrook Homestead, 2010 The timber chapel at Cressbrook is one of the first buildings seen as one enters the property, situated to the south of the Cottage. Surrounding the chapel and adjacent graveyard is a recent timber, post and rail fence. The Chapel is a rectangular building, consisting of a nave and a small side porch on the eastern end of the south facade of the building. The building has a steeply pitched corrugated iron roof which is gabled at the eastern and western ends with overhanging eaves. The eave overhang continues to form a roof for the porch, giving the otherwise symmetrical building, an asymmetrical form as the roof overhangs much further on the southern edge than on the northern. A timber battened panel is attached to the upper section plain barge boards of the gables on the east and west facades of the building. The timber framed church is clad with horizontal timber boards and is slightly elevated on round timber stumps, though these and the cavity beneath the building are concealed with a timber boarded \\"skirt\\", which extends to the ground from the floor level allowing only the stump caps to be seen. The eastern facade has two centrally located windows, of slender rectangular openings fitted with leadlight windows. Tracery divides the rectangular panels into three openings, a lancet-esque opening with tre-foiled arched head and, above this, two smaller tre-foiled shapes. The openings are glazed with diamond mullioned glass. A timber sill projects from the base of the windows. Along both the northern and southern facades of the buildings are three similar window openings. The porch, which is reached on three open tread timber steps on the southern facade comprises a gabled awning projecting from the extended roof overhang. This is supported on timber columns with a timber lintel spanning the distance between the columns, carved with \\"VICTORIA 1901 CHAPEL\\". A bell hangs within the gable of the porch. The porch provides access to the double timber boarded door which is braced with slender iron hinged brackets. The door opening is rectangular with a segmental arched head. Internally, the chapel is a single space, divided into seven bays by the heavy hammer beam roof trusses. The cavities created between the hammerbeam and the roof lining is infilled with a carved timber detail. Likewise, the cavity between the collar beam and the roof is infilled with timber battening, similar to that of the battening in the gables of the exterior of the church. The line of the roof truss continues on the internal wall with slender timber pilasters. The walls of the church are lined with vertical timber boards and the ceiling is lined with similar boards running parallel to the nave of the church. At the western end of the chapel is a small platform extending on which sits three pieces of furniture; a lectern, altar table and chair, all designed in keeping with the building.  Outbuildings  Many early outbuildings and structures survive at Cressbrook including two tank stands, draft stables, an explosives store, dairy complex, cattle dip and early workers' residences. Two tank stands survive, one round stand between the House and Cottage and another, square stand near the explosives store at the eastern end of the built up area at Cressbrook. The stands comprise a large number of timber posts extending many metres upwards, forming a dense \\"forest\\" of columns. The iron tanks surmounting these structures survive, corrugated iron on the circular stand, and cast iron on the square stand. As of June 2017 aerial photography shows that the larger tank stand appears to have been dismantled. Two support posts remain in place; the holes for the 20+ other posts are visible. The posts can be seen stored not far away. There is no obvious sign of the corrugated iron. This may be a consequence of demolition or refurbishment in process. A large open shed comprising an expansive hipped corrugated iron roof supported on timber posts forms part of the early draft stables. This building houses an early carriage, apparently acquired by the McConnels from the Queensland Government when a present was made to the Government of some red deer which were freed near Cressbrook. On the northern side of the stables is a large recess, where the roof is cut out. A small explosives store is situated to the east of the stables and this is a small rectangular planned building constructed of prefabricated concrete blocks, and has a hipped roof. Several small residences survive on the southern side of the approach drive, this are mainly timber framed and clad buildings some with verandahs and garages. A dairy complex survives at the eastern end of this built up area and this comprises a number of interconnected open shed with corrugated iron roofs supported on timber posts. Holding yards abutting the dairy also survive. Sections of the cattle dip and several other outbuildings along with extensive early fencing and shelters survive on this southern side of the approach road. Significant early plantings and gardens survive at Cressbrook.  Heritage listing  Cressbrook Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Cressbrook Homestead was established by David Cannon McConnel in 1841, the first run taken in the Brisbane Valley. The run demonstrates the development of Queensland, particularly the Brisbane River Valley area in the 1840s, after it was opened to settlement with the closure of the penal colony. The property illustrates the development of pastoral practices in Queensland, particularly the development of dairying in the Brisbane River Valley. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Cressbrook has many rare built elements including an early 1840s slab hut; a timber chapel with fittings designed by Robin Dods; an 1860s timber framed and brick nogged house and various other 1860s buildings. The site remains remarkably intact, though continual additions have been made very few early structures have been removed from the site. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The early date of Cressbrook with its many extant features suggest that a potential exists for further historical and archaeological research which may yield information which will contribute to an understanding of early Queensland station life. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an early Queensland pastoral station. The arrangement of the early buildings and their relationship to the working farm and outbuildings provides important evidence of early station life. The chapel is an important and characteristic example of the work of renowned architect, Robin S. Dods. The early station buildings are good intact examples of slab huts constructed in the mid-nineteenth century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Cressbrook has enormous aesthetic significance; the entire site has a picturesque quality resulting from the layering of various periods of building construction over 150 years and the siting of these buildings overlooking the Brisbane River. The chapel has significant architectural merit as a well designed example of Australian Arts and Crafts ecclesiastical architecture adapted for Queensland conditions. The quality of this building including materials, detailing, siting, composition of the external facades, fittings and furniture, is exceptional. The chapel, one of the first ecclesiastical buildings designed by Robin Dods in Queensland displays a high degree of creative achievement, in its employment of the Arts and Craft idiom of the turn of the century, in which Dods was well versed and innovative. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cressbrook has special associations with the Brisbane River Valley community as their first settled station and a place of employment for many hundreds of local residents and their families many of whom remain in the area. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place is associated with the prominent McConnel family who still own Cressbrook and were instrumental in the development of the Valley and the town of Esk; also with Robin Dods who designed the chapel and extensions to the House.

They were well known for being the clan of Zahir al-Umar, who ruled a semi-autonomous sheikhdom in the Galilee and other parts of Palestine in the 18th century.Joudah, 1987, p. 19. They were Sunni MuslimsFirro, 1992, p. 45 and affiliated with the Qaysi tribal alliance. History Origins According to historian Ahmad Hasan Joudah, the origins of the Zaydani clan are obscure, but that they were certainly of Arab stock. Members of the clan claim descent from Zayd, the son of Hasan ibn Ali and grandson of Ali, the fourth caliph of Islam. However, historians Mikha'il Sabbagh and Isa al-Ma'luf assert that the clan's ancestor was a man named Zaydan, hence their name Zaydani (pl. Zayadinah). Several historians believe the clan was originally from the Hejaz, and that they migrated to the Levant during Saladin's conquest of the region in the late 12th century. During the early Ottoman era (1517-1917), members of the Zaydani clan lived in the vicinity of Maarrat al-Nu'man, a city on the main road between Damascus and Aleppo. They were a semi-nomadic and relatively small clan of roughly fifty people and as such were under the protection of the larger Banu Asad tribe, according to Sabbagh. However, Joudah notes there was no tribe in Syria at the time known as the Banu Asad.Joudah, 1987, p. 20. Sabbagh maintains that from their base near Maarrat al-Nu'man, the Zayadina cultivated lucrative relationships with merchants from Aleppo and Damascus and the sheikh (chief) of the clan grew wealthy enough to become a target of their Banu Asad protectors. The Zayadina were attacked by the latter and moved southward, eventually settling in Tiberias in the eastern Galilee.Joudah, 1987, p. 20. Establishment in Galilee After moving to Tiberias in the 17th century, the Zaydani sheikh (chieftain) was appointed the multazem (tax collector) of the town by the Druze emir (prince) of Mount Lebanon who belonged to the Ma'an clan.Joudah, 1987, p. 20. The name of the Zaydani chieftain is disputed, though Joudah believes he \\"probably called Zaydan\\". The Ma'an, their Shihab successors, and the Zayadinah were associated with the Qaysi tribo-political faction.Joudah, 1987, p. 21. At some point, the Zayadina were compelled to leave Tiberias, but were invited to settle elsewhere in the Galilee by the Banu Saqr tribe who controlled the region west of Tiberias. The Zayadina chose to live in Arrabat al-Battuf. Apparently that village's inhabitants welcomed the Zayadina and were impressed by the generosity of the Zaydani sheikh, who kept his doors open to receive visitors from Arrabat al-Battuf and its vicinity. The Zaydani sheikh defended Arrabat al-Battuf from encroachments by the Druze sheikh of nearby Sallama. The Zayadina proceeded to sack Sallama sometime between 1688 and 1692. Nine other Druze villages were also destroyed, including Kammaneh and Dallata.Firro, 1992, p. 46 Thereafter, the Zayadina gained iltizam (tax farm) rights over the al-Battuf subdistrict of Safad Sanjak and later the Shaghur subdistrict from the Governor of Sidon Eyalet, Qublan Pasha al-Matarji. The entrenchment of the Zayadina's power in the Galilee, particularly with the rise of Zahir al-Umar in the mid-18th century led to a partial exodus of Druze from the Safad region to the Hauran. Around 1697, when the Shihab family succeeded their Ma'ani relatives for leadership of Mount Lebanon, their governor for Safad, Emir Mansur, appointed Zaydan's son, Umar al-Zaydani, as multazem of Safad and its vicinity. In 1701, Sheikh Umar became governor of Safad as a result of Emir Mansur's death. He remained in the position until his death in 1706. His son Sa'd al-Umar succeeded him as head of the clan, although his younger brother Zahir al-Umar was ceded control over the iltizam (tax farms) that the clan held, giving him great influence over the Zayadina. The Zayadina under Zahir's command successfully defended the village of Bi'ina from the forces of Sidon's governor sometime between 1713 and 1718, earning him prestige among the local inhabitants.Philipp, 2013, p. 31. In the 1720s, the Zayadina fortified Deir Hanna and turned it into their rural stronghold.Orser, 1996, p. 465 Peak of power Between the 1720s and 1776, the Zayadina under Zahir had consolidated their control over the entire Galilee and other parts of Palestine. The Zayadina clan's territories were virtually autonomous from the Ottoman Empire. Their rule was ended by the Ottoman forces of Hasan Pasha al-Jaza'iri and Jezzar Pasha. Descendants Family tree of Zahir al-Umar's branch of the Zayadina clan up to his modern-day descendants In Haifa in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the al-Bashir al-Zaydani family, descendants of the Zayadina, were influential among Haifa's ulama (Muslim scholars) and its sharia court.Agmon, 2006, p. 67 The Bashirs' position among Haifa's religious offices dwindled by the 1880s and by then they had lost most of their properties.Panzac, 1995, pp. 549-550. Many of the descendants of the Zayadina in modern-day Israel use the surname \\"al-Zawahirah\\"Joudah, 1987, p. 118. or \\"Dhawahri\\"Srouji, 2003, p. 187 in honor of Zahir (whose name is also spelled \\"Dhaher\\"). They mostly live in the Galilee towns of Nazareth, Bi'ina, al-Damun (depopulated in 1948) and Kafr Manda.Joudah, 1987, p. 121. A member of the Zayadina tribe, Yousef Abbas, settled in Amman in Transjordan in the 17th century. Around three decades later, his family migrated to Irbid and were thenceforth called \\"al-Tal\\" (the Hill). The family was named al-Tal because in Amman they had lived close to the town's citadel, which was built on a hill or tal. Yousef's four sons, Hussein, Hassan, Abd al-Rahman and Abd al-Rahim and their modern-day descendants continue to use the surname al-Tal, sometimes with \\"Yousef\\" as an antecedent.Yitzhak, 2012, p. 21. From Irbid, members of the al-Tal family served in various Ottoman governmental positions in the 19th and early 20th centuries.Yitzhak, 2012, p. 22. The family was involved in the establishment of the Emirate of Transjordan, a British protectorate under the nominal rule of Emir Abdullah and played important roles in its government. Prominent family members include a general of Jordan's Arab Legion, Abdullah al-Tal, and Jordanian Prime Minister Wasfi al-Tal.Yitzhak, 2012, pp. 22-23.

Career Edward DevereuxCollectanea Topographica & Genealogica, Volume VIII. (London: John Bowyer Nichols and Son, 1843). 299-303 was born about 1544, and was the son of Walter Devereux, 1st Viscount Hereford by his second wife, Margaret Garneys, daughter of Robert Garneys of Kenton, Suffolk. His father established him at Castle Bromwich upon his marriage to Catherine Arden of Park Hall, Warwickshire.L F Salzman (editor). A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 4, Hemlingford Hundred. (London, 1947). Parishes: Castle Bromwich, in pp. 43-47 (accessed 3 July 2015). He inherited little property on the death of his father, but purchased in 1572 from his half-nephew, Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, the reversion of the Warwickshire manor of Castle Bromwich, which formed part of the jointure of his mother Margaret, the Dowager Viscountess of Hereford. Sir Edward then built Castle Bromwich Hall in 1599, a mansion built in the Jacobean style.Lords of the Manor of Castle Bromwich (accessed 4 July 2015) He was the Member of Parliament for Tamworth from 1588 to 1589. He served as Sheriff of Warwickshire from 1593 to 1594. Following the execution of his great-nephew, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, for treason, Edward Devereux and several of his relatives were reported to Sir Robert Cecil for holding a clandestine meeting at Wolverhampton. However, no charges were ever brought regarding this. Edward Devereux acquired considerable wealth during his lifetime. For a payment of ¬£1000 to support efforts for suppressing a rebellion in Ireland, King James I of England created him Baronet of Castle Bromwich on 25 November 1611 (10 Jac 1).Sir Egerton Brydges. Collins Peerage of England. (London: 1812). Volume VI; Devereux, Viscount Hereford, pages 1 to 22 He was knighted the following year. When his son and heir, Walter Devereux, married his second wife (probably in January 1615), Edward settled on him the Herefordshire manor of Stoke Lacy. Following Edward‚Äôs death, his son Walter engaged in a bitter quarrel over his inheritance with his mother Catherine. The source of their dispute was an agreement made in 1601. As a widow, Catherine was to retain possession of Castle Bromwich during her lifetime. In return, she was to pay her son an annual rent of ¬£40; allow him to occupy a designated suite of rooms in the manor house if he wished; and grant him the right to receive the profits of timber on the estate. These arrangements, which had seemed acceptable when they were made, were now regarded by Walter Devereux as distinctly unattractive. Lady Catherine had already been well provided for, both by her husband Edward and his father, the 1st Viscount Hereford; between them, they had granted her a jointure estate worth ¬£400 per annum. Her lease of Castle Bromwich gave her an additional ¬£120 a year in clear profit. All told, Walter complained, his mother‚Äôs landed income was now of a greater yearly value than the lands and tenements he had as heir of his father. Catherine responded to these complaints in February 1623 by accusing her son in Chancery of making Castle Bromwich the subject of secret conveyances, and of refusing to allow her half the interest on loans made by her husband during his lifetime. As Sir Edward had ¬£21,000 out on loan at his death, the sum involved was substantial. Unfortunately for Walter Devereux, the 1601 lease agreement was valid in law, and consequently, his mother Catherine retained Castle Bromwich and most of its contents until her death in 1627. Marriage He married Katherine Arden, eldest daughter of Edward Arden, Esquire, of Park Hall, Warwickshire, by his wife, Mary Throckmorton.Townend, Peter.

Crawford, a young black man, was convicted and sentenced to death that year for suffocating his one-year-old son. His death sentence was seen as part of a pattern in the parish, which has the highest rate of death penalty sentencing in the nation. The prosecutor in this case said this penalty was needed for society's revenge. The conviction greatly depended upon the findings of a disputed pathology report. After sentencing, Crawford was held on death row, the second-youngest man there. He was imprisoned at Louisiana State Penitentiary, commonly called Angola. New medical evidence introduced in 2014 on appeal of the case disputed the findings of the prosecution witnesses. In 2016, the conviction was overturned by the Louisiana Supreme Court on appeal, due to findings of prosecution misconduct in jury selection. In April 2017, the Caddo Parish District Attorney's Office dismissed all charges against Crawford; he was exonerated. Families At age 23, Crawford had been living with his mother, brother, sister, grandmother, and uncle, in Mooretown, a neighborhood in Shreveport. The mother of his son is Lakendra Lott, a close friend whom Crawford had known since childhood. Both of them also have daughters from other relationships. Lott lived with her family several houses away. Case Crawford claimed his one-year-old son Roderius Lott had been sleeping next to him, and was unresponsive when Crawford awoke in the morning. When police arrived, they asked about a bruise on the infant's lip. Crawford said that his son had fallen in the bathroom the day before. Crawford denied that he had accidentally slept on top of his son. That same day, James Traylor, a police pathologist, determined that the bruise on the infant's lip indicated smothering, and other bruises indicated child abuse. During the autopsy Traylor also noticed signs of pneumonia in the infant's lungs and that he had sepsis, but did not consider it serious enough to cause death. Based upon Traylor's conclusions, chief assistant district attorney Dale Cox charged Crawford with homicide, and asked for the death penalty. The scientific validity of Traylor's conclusions was questioned before, during, and after the trial. Conflicting pathology reports Dr. James Traylor, Jr., a pathologist from the University Health Center at Louisiana State University, performed the autopsy. He acknowledged that the autopsy revealed that the infant had sepsis, which can be fatal, and bilateral bronchial pneumonia, but said this was not sufficient to cause death. He claimed that bruises were a result of abuse and the infant Roderius was smothered. The Caddo Parish Coroner, Dr. Thoma, also \\"said the boy's broncho-pneumonia 'was not significant enough to have killed the child' and had nothing to do with his death.\\"Maurice Possley, \\"Rodricus Crawford\\", National Registry of Exonerations\\", last updated 19 November 2017 \\"Traylor said that his finding of suffocation was based entirely on the bruises on Roderius's lips, but he never sampled the tissue to date the injury, a basic test that would have revealed whether the bruises came from the earlier fall in the bathroom, an explanation that he ignored. He misstated medical science, telling the jury that Roderius's brain had swelled as a result of suffocation. Swelling does not occur in cases of smothering, because the person dies rapidly, and the brain can't swell if blood has stopped circulating. The brain can swell, though, in cases of pneumonia with sepsis.\\" Pathologist Daniel Spitz testified for the defense. He had co-authored a pathology text book with his father Werner Spitz, which is widely used in medical schools. Daniel Spitz determined the infant died from pneumonia and testified to that conclusion. Prosecutor Dale Cox tried to discredit Spitz by questioning him about a mistake the pathologist had once made in another case. Since the trial, several other pathologists have questioned the scientific validity of the original pathologist's conclusion that the infant died from suffocation. The prosecution's case appeared to depend almost entirely on interpretation of complex pathology data. Four experts testified at the 2016 Louisiana Supreme Court appeals hearing that the infant had died of pneumonia, which contributed to the overturning of Crawford's conviction. Trial and conviction Before the trial started in Shreveport, Prosecutor Dale Cox used five of seven peremptory challenges to dismiss black jurors from the jury. Crawford was tried in and found guilty in November 2013. During the penalty phase of the trial, the defense called character witnesses, including his mother and brother, who testified that he was a loving, responsible father. During cross examination, the prosecution brought up the facts that Crawford had dropped out of high school, had no job, and smoked marijuana, which was illegal. The same facts are characteristic of many of the other residents of his neighborhood. The prosecutor made a lengthy argument during the penalty phase, quoting the Bible and claiming that it supported the death penalty. The jury voted for the death penalty. The defense moved for a new trial, based on Cox's having \\"misquoted and misinterpreted biblical authority in the argument that Jesus would punish one who harms a child with the death penalty and thus violated Crawford's right to a fair trial.\\" They had affidavits from three theologians about correct interpretation of the passage. The motion was denied by the trial judge. Shreveport is the county seat for Caddo Parish, where juries have sentenced more persons to death than in any other county in the United States. Prosecutor Dale Cox, who won more than a third of death sentences in the county in the previous five years, has said, \\"I'm a believer that the death penalty serves society's interest in revenge.\\" Cox sent a letter to Crawford's probation officer, stating, \\"I am sorry that Louisiana has adopted lethal injection as the form of implementing the death penalty. Mr. Crawford deserves as much physical suffering as it is humanly possible to endure before he dies.\\" As Crawford's attorney Daryl Gold expected, his first appeal for a writ of certiorari from the Louisiana Supreme Court was denied on November 14, 2014, as the court seldom overturns convictions. The brief discussed statistics and the \\"racial and geographic arbitrariness of the death penalty in Louisiana‚Äîconfined predominantly to African-American men prosecuted in Caddo Parish\\"‚Äîand said that \\"Crawford's fate depended far more on where he was prosecuted than his ultimate moral culpability.\\" Appeal and release In 2014, while the case was on appeal before the Louisiana Supreme Court, the defense introduced new medical evidence, \\"affidavits from a pediatric neuropathologist, a pediatric neurologist, and an expert in pediatric infectious diseases, all of which said that Roderius was the victim of bronchopneumonia.\\" There was additional evidence related to interpretation of the condition of the brain and bruises. The defense requested that the case be remanded to the trial court for a hearing, which the court denied on March 16, 2015. But in November 2016, Crawford's conviction was overturned by the Court. They found that Prosecutor Cox may have discriminated against black jurors during jury selection, and the trial judge had erred by not responding to the defense motion on this issue. The court further expressed surprise that Crawford had been prosecuted at all, given that the autopsy showed the infant had sepsis and bronchio-pneumonia and there was no evidence that Crawford had a history of abusing his son. It ordered Crawford released on bond, pending a new trial or other action by the District Attorney's Office. Exoneration Crawford was released on bond, and his case was re-evaluated by a new district attorney. Dale Cox had decided against running for re-election in 2015, and resigned from the district attorney's office that year. On April 17, 2017, the Caddo Parish District Attorney's Office formally dismissed all charges against Mr. Crawford. It said it \\"could not meet the burden of proof to gain a new conviction for Mr. Crawford.\\"\\"Louisiana Death Row Inmate\\", New York Times, 20 April 2017 In November 2017, Crawford filed a federal lawsuit against police and others, including several parties including the Caddo Parish Coroner's Office, the Caddo Parish District Attorney's Office, and the Shreveport Fire Department.

The villa was designed and built by Giuliano da Maiano and located in the city of Naples, in the district now known as Poggioreale, between the present Via del Campo, Via Santa Maria del Pianto and the new and old Via Poggioreale. At the time it was built, a period when the capital city of the Kingdom of Naples was renowned for elegant homes with expansive vistas of the surrounding landscape and Mount Vesuvius, the villa was outside the city walls of Naples and was one of the most important architectural achievements of the Neapolitan Renaissance.Gardiner, Eileen, d'Engenio Caracciolo, Cesare, and Bacco, Enrico; Naples, An Early Guide, Italica Press 2008, Introduction p. xlv. .

History At the villa's building site there was a bubbling aqueduct (or Volla) that carried the waters of the Sarno with connected underground pipelines, and which was connected to the Piscina Mirabilis reservoir then called Dogliuolo, from the Latin Doliolum or Dolium (bath). The valley area of Dogliuolo was then a swampy expanse of wetlands, despite several attempts at reclamation by Neapolitan sovereigns of the Anjou and Aragon families. In 1485, King Ferdinand I of Naples decreed the reclamation of the area when he realized that drainage issues were the source and cause of malaria in the capital, and so issued his Fosso Fosso del Graviolo to eradicate the problem.F. Quinterio, Giuliano da Maiano, Grandissimo Domestico, Roma, 1996, pag. 438-469. During the same period and in the same area, numerous villas were built for the Neapolitan Renaissance nobility. Around 1487, the Duke of Calabria, crown prince and future king Alfonso II, bought farmland in the Poggioreale valley Dogliolo,The name was later corrupted. having decided to build a royal summer residence outside the city walls, perhaps in imitation of what his ally Lorenzo de' Medici was making at the time at Villa di Castello, as Alfonso hired away Lorenzo's architect. Lorenzo's favorite architect, Giuliano da Sangallo, also visited Naples during the villa's construction, and Alfonso eventually sent him back to Florence with gifts of money, plate, and antique sculpture for Lorenzo.

Construction For the construction of the building and its annexes, Alfonso used his authority to expropriate land from others, often without compensation, for example, during construction he removed the standing water flowing to some mills that belonged to Gian Battista Brancaccio.Zecchino, Francesco, La Villa di Poggioreale, residenza degli Aragonesi a Napoli, Delpinoa, n.s.44:3-16. 2002. Accessed 2015-07-05. (The Villa Poggioreale, residence of the Aragonese in Naples.) This reference offers derived images of the property developed by scholars of the period. For the residence's design, he hired the Florentine architect Giuliano da Maiano, who arrived in Naples in 1487 with a model for the villa which he had developed while still in Florence. Giuliano da Maiano began the work that year and continued to direct construction until his death in 1490, when the building was substantially completed and partially occupied. Construction then continued, possibly by Francesco di Giorgio Martini and students of Maiano, and ultimately the Villa Poggio Reale became the seat of the Neapolitan court. The design of the villa was a considerable success and was mentioned in Book III of Sebastiano Serlio's architectural treatise of sixteenth century Italian architecture.Sebastiano Serlio, I sette Libri dell'architettura, Libro III, 1584, ristampa ed. Forni, 1987. Drawings also available at archive.org, p.157 of the b/w PDF file. Abandonment During the Italian wars, in 1494 Charles VIII invaded Italy, King Alfonso fled to Sicily with some of the villa's most valuable furnishings, and soon after, the building was abandoned. Charles helped himself to the villa's remaining treasures while Alfonso was in hiding to avoid him, and while there Charles became so enthralled by the villa's charms that he induced the villa's garden designers Fra 'Giocondo and Pacello da Mercogliano to follow him to France to design the gardens of his own royal residences.V. Fontana, Fra' Giovanni Giocondo architetto, 1988.Charles' letter to his brother-in-law, Pierre de Bourbon, noted in William Howard Adams, The French Garden 1500-1800, 1979, p. 10. Later on, King Ferdinand II of Naples ceded parts of the villa to others during a time when he was in financial difficulty, including the gardens, which by that time were used for cultivation. Battle site Beginning to crumble by the time of the sack of Rome in 1527, at the end of the High Renaissance the villa found itself at the center of Odet de Foix's battle for the conquest of Naples. With the villa's aqueduct ruined in the battle, a malaria epidemic broke out that destroyed his army, and the French were forced to withdraw. In the aftermath, nature took its course: the area around the Villa Poggio Reale returned to its natural swamp-like state, and years passed before the reclamation of the surrounding land began again. The ruined villa was also used as a meeting place in 1535 by Naples' sovereign at the time, Charles V.The source is unclear for the reason or participants of this meeting, but when Charles arrived in Naples that November he stayed on for several months, and he did meet with his local Vice-Regent Pedro Alvarez de Toledo; between them they made and carried out ambitious plans for cleaning up and fortifying the city. Mallett, M. and Shaw, C., The Italian Wars: 1494‚Äì1559, Pearson Educ. Ltd, 2012, pp. 231-2. Because of repeated earthquakes, by 1582 it was necessary to strengthen the villa's remaining structure to avoid it collapsing altogether. Villa Poggio Reale, 1718 drawing published by Domenico Antonio Parrino Revival By 1604, King Philip III of Spain was the ruler of Naples, and a revival of Villa Poggio Reale was started by his viceroy Juan Alonso Pimentel de Herrera, who also decided to beautify the approach to the royal villa with an avenue of trees and fountains.Poggio Reale, gardenvisit.com. Accessed 2015-07-05. (Parrino published a drawing of the planned avenue in 1718.) However, with the resurgence of bubonic plague in 1656, the villa and its gardens again fell into disrepair. The remains of the villa became, from that time, a burial place for lepers, and thus King Alfonso II's villa was abandoned to death, and given, as evidenced by eighteenth century documents, to the Miroballo family; in 1789, one of the family members spoke explicitly of the palace as collapsed and its gardens reduced to cropland. Final destruction In 1762, an official cemetery was built a short distance from the villa's site by Ferdinando Fuga, the Cemetery of the 366 Fosse. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, another burial place, this time the Cemetery of Poggioreale, was built atop the ruins of the villa, obliterating the villa entirely and making the determination of the exact location of the former villa's premises very difficult.R. Pane, Architettura ed Urbanistica del Rinascimento, in AA.VV. Storia di Napoli (Architecture and Urbanism of the Renaissance, in History of Naples), 1974. Further difficulties for historians and archaeologists are presented by the fact that Naples suffered heavy Allied bombing raids during World War II, particularly from 1940-43. During the war, the main Allied effort on Italy's west coast initially centered on the port of Naples, selected because it was the northernmost port that could receive Allied air support by fighter aircraft operating from Sicily.Matthews, Jeff, Air Raids on Naples in WWII, Around Naples Encyclopedia (via archive.org), UMUC Italian Studies, January 2006. Accessed 2015-07-05. The now-archived site has photographs of the bomb damage in Naples. It is unknown whether documentation of the villa was destroyed when the German army set fire to the Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III, third largest of Italy's National Libraries, during the Four days of Naples. Description Sebastiano Serlio, Treatise of Architecture, Book III, Venice 1540. During the 15-16th century, the Crown of Aragon's de facto capital was Naples, and Villa Poggio Reale's design was the culmination of the gradual conversion from purely Italian medieval domestic architecture to the Moorish-influenced forms of the Aragonese Renaissance architectural style from Valencia, a process of evolution that took place in that late fifteenth century capital as well as everywhere the nobility of Aragon settled. One can still get an idea of the villa in Sebastiano Serlio's 1584 treatise showing the villa's critical fortune that made it an exemplar of sixteenth century architecture. Giorgio Vasari later reported, \\"At Poggio Reale [Giuliano da Maiano] laid out the architecture of that palazzo, always considered a most beautiful thing; and to fresco it he brought there Pietro del Donzello, a Florentine, and Polito his brother who was considered in that time a good master, who painted the whole palazzo, inside and out, with the history of the said king.\\"\\"A Poggio Reale ordin√≤ l'architettura di quel palazzo, tenuta sempre cosa bellissima; et a dipignerlo vi condusse Piero del Donzello fiorentino e Polito suo fratello che in quel tempo era tenuto buon maestro, il quale dipinse tutto il palazzo di dentro e di fuori con storie di detto re.\\" (Giorgio Vasari, Le vie de' pi√π eccelenti architetti, piiori...). The main building was characterized by an original design, with architectural references to ancient elements adapted to the contemporary needs of the day: its foundation was of the same type as ancient Roman-style villas, peristyled but buttressed with defensive elements because of the needs of a fortified palace, and had interior and exterior loggias as well as elements of play, as the residence was a recreation spot of the royal court of the day.Florence (Firenze) and Italian Renaissance garden design, gardenvisit.com. Accessed 2015-07-05. The result was a building of relatively small dimensions, characterized by a main body with a quadrangular base, with four projecting wings at the corners, similar to angular towers, but with height equal to the rest of the building. The building was arranged around a square courtyard paved with glazed ceramic tiles, with the courtyard sunk to a depth of five steps, similar to ancient Roman structures such as theaters and thermal baths.R. Pane, L'architettura del Rinascimento in Napoli, (Renaissance architecture in Naples), Napoli, 1937. The courtyard, according to a model by Vitruvius, could be covered with a wooden platform to be used for parties and performances, or could be flooded for a scenic lake effect.Sebastiano Serlio, I sette Libri dell'architettura, Libro III, 1584, ristampa ed. Forni, 1987.Vitruvius, De Architectura libri decem (De architectura), The Ten Books on Architecture, 15 BCE. The drawing made by Serlio, who never saw the building, does not match perfectly the original construction since it is centered on the four colonnaded exterior elevations that were never realized.Schroeter Gothein, M.L., et al., A History of Garden Art, Cambridge Univ. Press, 2014, pp. 217-18. Serlio also does not address the wooden roof that would have transformed the courtyard into a large central hall. Also, the building was not a perfect square, but a rectangle as shown by the sparse but iconographic later documentation. Inside the villa were loggias on two floors and frescos by the most important artists of the day, with the sovereign's quests emphasized among the many paintings by artists Donzello and his brother Ippolito, each chronicling episodes of Alfonso's skirmishes against the warring barons of a few years earlier. Setting The main building overlooked a garden square and sat in front of a large side yard with service buildings. The complex continued with a fish pond and other garden areas, all to the side of the main building. The villa and its service buildings were surrounded by a large park, also used as a hunting area, which reached to the sea. Of particular beauty were the formal gardens decorated with exuberant fountains, their virtues extolled in the French poem Le Vergier d‚ÄôHoneur,Octavien de Saint-Gelais; Andr√© de La Vigne, Le vergier d'honneur, nouvellement imprim√© a\` Paris De l'entreprise et voyage de Napples. Auquel est compris comment le roy Charles huitiesme de son nom ... passa ... depuis Lyon jusques a\` Napples, ..., Paris, Jean Petit, 1500. . (Some sources spell \\"vergier\\" as \\"vergiez\\".) and also remarkable was the presence of many ancient sculptures which were scattered throughout the building and in the various parts of the gardens. The design of the gardens was perhaps due, at least in part, to the efforts of Giovanni Giocondo and Pacello da Mercogliano, both artists stolen from Alfonso by Charles of France for their skill and talent they could apply to his own gardens.

She pastored and served Tulsa, Oklahoma's poor and homeless for over 50 years.  Early life  Grace Bee Anderson was born in 1919 to Toby and Georgia Brooks Anderson. Grace was the 3rd of 11 children. She married VeOtis Tucker in 1937. They settled in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, and together they had 16 children. Though she had been raised in the church, she had not actively attended church in many years. Shortly after marrying VeOtis, she had a conversion experience and joined the Church of God in Christ. She soon realized that she was called to minister to members of her community. She began holding Bible study meetings in her home.  Ministry  When her ministry first began, Grace Tucker was a part of the Church of God in Christ. She actively served in ministry and functioned as leader in her local church ‚Äì Church of God in Christ Number 1. At the time that she realized she was called to minister, the Church of God in Christ did not allow women to be ordained. She eventually had to make a break from the Church of God in Christ in order to pursue her calling to the ministry. She founded a home church, and eventually built a small church in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. She is believed to be the first woman to pastor an independent church in Oklahoma. She and her husband VeOtis involved themselves in benevolence ministry, and frequently took disadvantaged church members into their home. They relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the 1960s. Grace expanded her ministry there to include extensive work with the disadvantaged. She owned several thrift shops and clothing and furniture distribution centers aimed at serving the low income population over the next 50 years. She named her church \\"Revival Center House of Prayer\\". The church, which still stands today, is known for its spirited services, and its emphasis on \\"spirit-led\\" worship, including singing, dancing, laying on of hands and speaking in tongues. Throughout her 50 plus years of ministry, her slogan was, \\"Everybody is Somebody\\". Because she operated a thrift store near downtown Tulsa, she would frequently encounter homeless people who were in need of basic clothing, food and shelter. She purchased a building in 1981 at 739 N. Main street in Tulsa, Oklahoma which would double as a church building and shelter for Tulsa's most needy citizens. She dubbed it the \\"Rescue Home\\". After receiving a $40,000 donation in 1986, she was able to purchase a former country club on Tulsa's west side that was to become a multipurpose facility. She had plans to feed the hungry, start a Christian school for low-income families and hold church services there. After only a few months, the building was destroyed by a fire. She continued to house the homeless and feed the poor while pastoring her congregation throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Police would often send vagrants to her ministry rather than arrest them for vagrancy. Mother Grace Tucker revolutionized the way the homeless were cared for in the city of Tulsa. She put no restrictions on residents of her Rescue Mission with regard to inebriation or time limits. She housed and fed anyone that was in need of her help. After her nightly church services, she would host what she named, \\"The Mercy Meal\\". It is estimated that she provided more than 500,000 meals to Tulsa's poor. Through the years, she formed several satellite non- denominational \\"House of Prayer\\" churches in Oklahoma for which she was an Apostle and Overseer. in the mid-1980s, she began the tradition of handing out Thanksgiving meals to underprivileged families. For several years in the 1980s and 1990s, she handed out over 1,000 turkey dinners. [ In subsequent years, charities in Tulsa and beyond began to implement similar programs. Her husband and father to her 16 children, VeOtis Roosevelt Tucker Sr. died in 1988 at the age of 81. Mother Tucker Ministries, a not for profit umbrella organization, was established in the early 1990s to address the needs of the economically disadvantaged in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma. It is managed by her children and is still in operation today.  Awards and honors  She received multiple awards and honors, including having May 6 declared to be, \\"Annual Mother Grace Tucker Day\\" by Governor George Nigh in 1986. It continues to be celebrated to the present day. Main Street, the site of her original Rescue Mission, was renamed, \\"Mother Tucker Boulevard\\" in 2006.

The Cardinals.  Career  He entered the Order of Saint Benedict early in life and first entered the monastery of S. Paolo fuori le mura, Rome. He was created cardinal in 1078, elected abbot of Saint-Victor de Marseille (1079‚Äì1106), appointed papal legate, then Archbishop of Narbonne (1106‚Äì1121), he was a major player in papal policy to regain control of the hierarchy the Church, between Toulouse and Marseille. He was involved in the investiture quarrel between the papacy and the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire between 1075 and 1122. Much of which revolved around the Proven√ßal lands in the Kingdom of Burgundy, attached to the Holy Roman Empire.Martin Aurell, Jean-Paul Boyer, No√´l Coulet ‚Äì La Provence au Moyen √Çge, page 42.  Family  Born about 1052 into an extremely powerful house at the time, his family were of viscounts of Millau, and their actions involved the continuity of power strategies between the various aristocratic families of France. He was the fourth child of Richard II (? ‚Äì 1051), Vicount de Millau (1023) and his wife Rixinde of Narbonne. His brother Bernat had been abbot of abb√© de Saint-Victor before him. He was made Archbishop of Narbonne, in circumstance of controversy and held the see from 1106 until his death. His nephew Arnaud de L√©v√©zou would also be Bishop of Narbonne and other nephews would hold see in Arles and d'Aix. His father Richard was Viscount of Millau and Rixinde, His mother a daughter of B√©renger, Viscount of Narbonne. So Richard was therefore part of the viscount family of Millau and the G√©vaudan, holders of the Rodez County, Count of Toulouse. Through his mother, he is allied to the viscount of Narbonne, and the house of Carcassonne. Of his siblings tree, (Berenger, Raymond and Hughes) shared the viscountal power. While Richard, his brother Bernard who he succeeded as abbot of Saint-Victor de Marseille entered the church. Through marriage he was connected to the main noble houses in Southern France.Florian Mazel ‚Äì La noblesse et l'√âglise en Provence, fin Xe-d√©but XIVe si√®cle ‚Äì page 175. As bishop he granted the Abbey of Saint-Victor de Marseille very large donations and gifts are the source of several important priories born ? and died February 15, 1121.  Career   Politics  Richard was intimately involved in the quarrel of investitures between the papacy and the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire between 1075 and 1122. He supported the anti-pope Clement III unto 1083 and was therefore deposited by Pope Gregory VII. when Richard repented, the new Pope reinstalled him. He was a legate under Pope Gregory VII in Spain in 1078. However, Richard fall into disgrace again under Pope Victor III Florian Mazel ‚Äì La noblesse et l'√âglise en Provence, fin Xe-d√©but XIVe si√®cle ‚Äì page 259. however he was reinstated by Pope Urban II, on February 20, 1089 Richard in office. Medieval Counties of FranceIn 1104, acting at the request of Pope Paschal II, he chaired a council in Troyes for absolving King Philip I of France and marking the alliance between the kingdom of France and the papacy against the empire. In 1110 when he was 27, he presided over a council at Clermont and one in Toulouse convened at his request, to suppress damage to the abbey of Mauriac. When his brother died he was given the Abbotship of the Abbey of St Victor. When Richards maternal uncle Aicard, Archbishop of Arles , took the side of the pope, He was placed as head of Montmajour Abbey by Pope Gregory VII with the Bull of 18 April 1081.Florian Mazel ‚Äì La noblesse et l'√âglise en Provence, fin Xe-d√©but XIVe si√®cle ‚Äì page 217.  Reform  Richard becomes the great promoter of the Episcopal reform movement in Provence and Languedoc relying on his powers as Cardinal and Legate. In the early 1080s, Richard succeeds in installing the monks of his monastery on bishoprics beginning with the dioceses closest to the abbey: Marseille and Aix-en-Provence. [8] In Aix, he is a member of the Viscount's family Marseille he has earned the Gregorian cause, in Marseille, a monk of modest origin. Richard also plays an important role in the implementation of the Victorine monks of Marseille in Narbonne city, despite the canonical opposition. Despite his support for the Gregorian reform, Richard constantly appears as a faithful representative of his family Millau-G√©vaudan. Using his role of leader of the reform movement and its proximity to the abbey of St. Victor,J√©r√¥me Belmon, \\" Aux sources du pouvoir des vicomtes de Millau (XIe si√®cle) \\", Vicomtes et vicomt√©s dans l‚ÄôOccident m√©di√©val, Toulouse, Presses universitaires du Mirail, 2008, p. 200. it encourages \\"out of his family reduced its mountain\\" and close to accession to important positions power in Provence and Languedoc, to the detriment of other aristocratic families.J√©r√¥me Belmon, \\" Aux sources du pouvoir des vicomtes de Millau (XIe si√®cle) \\", Vicomtes et vicomt√©s dans l‚ÄôOccident m√©di√©val, Toulouse, Presses universitaires du Mirail, 2008, p. 200. Thus, in 1073 [ref. required] play a role, it seems, decisive in the marriage of his nephew Gilbert Gevaudan with Gerberge, the Countess of Provence. In 1112, aside from the estate of the same county, rival local families by intervening to the Counts of Barcelona. It also promotes, against the interests of the family of Narbonne, another of his nephews, Arnaud de L√©v√©zou for his own succession to the Archbishop of Narbonne in 1121. Finally, many indications that this is another nephew, Atton Bruniquel, Richard up in 1115 in the diocese of Arles after the complicated episode of archi√©piscopats Aicard and Gibelin.Vaissete D'apr√®s dom Vaissete, Atton serait issu de la famille de Bruniquel et neveu par sa m√®re de Richard de Milhaud (1841), p. 44.. The action of Richard Millau therefore shows that around the year 1100, the diffusion of ideas in the Gregorian Midi mingles closely with rivalries and local vicomtales comtales families.Florian Mazel ‚Äì La noblesse et l'√âglise en Provence, fin Xe-d√©but XIVe si√®cle (2002)- page 194.  Building  At the Abbey of Saint-Victor he continued the construction on the Grand cartulary of the abbey, which had been begun under his brother Bernat in the 1070s. The work was completed before 1100AD under his direction.Florian Mazel ‚Äì L‚Äôinvention d‚Äôune tradition, in Ecrire son histoire : les communaut√©s religieuses r√©guli√®res face √† leur pass√© ‚Äì Nicole Bouter (dir) ‚Äì 2005 ‚Äì page 340.

The scion of an aristocratic family, formally trained in both philology and the sociology of literature, he emerged in the 1910s as a rebel, highly distinctive, voice among the Romanian press and book reviewers. He was a confidant and publisher of the Romanian writer Ion Luca Caragiale, building his theories on Caragiale's already trenchant appraisals of Romanian society and culture. Zarifopol defended art for art's sake even against the Marxism of his father-in-law, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, and the Poporanism of his friend, Garabet IbrƒÉileanu. He was also a noted censurer of neoclassical trends, of philistinism, and of inauthentic customs, advocating renewal, but not revolution. A skeptic reviewer of modernist literature, he reemerged during the interwar period as its dedicated promoter, but his preference for literary entertainment over substance and many of his literary bets were shortly dismissed by other experts of the day. Zarifopol endures in cultural memory as an eccentric‚Äînot just because he tackled and derided the literary establishment, but also because he refused to publish most of his work in book form, or take up employment in academia. Having lost a considerable fortune, he lived withdrawn from the public eye, surviving on his revenues as a literary columnist, mostly for IbrƒÉileanu's Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ. Shortly before his death, he set up his own successful magazine, Revista Funda»õiilor Regale. In such venues, Zarifopol defended his cosmopolitan philosophy against other philologists, but also against the emerging neotraditionalists at G√¢ndirea journal. Zarifopol viewed modern traditionalism as a fabrication and, with his essays, came out as a non-traditionalist and anti-totalitarian conservative thinker. Biography Origins and early life The future critic was born in Ia»ôi to Paul (Pavel) Zarifopol, or \\"Zarifopoulo\\", and his wife Elena (n√©e Culiano). His paternal family had attested Greek,\\"Biographical Note\\", in Ilinca Zarifopol- Johnston, Searching For Cioran, p. 271.

Originally horse traders and assignees for Ottoman Turks settled in Moldavia, they were elevated into the Moldavian boyar nobility after 1850. On his mother's Culiano side, Paul was related to prestigious literary and political figures. One of Elena's brothers was Nicolae Culianu, the boyar, astronomer, and doyen of Junimea literary society, great-grandfather of the religious scholar-novelist Ioan Petru Culianu.Ted Anton, Eros, Magic, & the Murder of Professor Culianu, pp. 31‚Äì32, 233. Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1996. His other maternal uncle, who remained closest to Elena, was jurist »òtefan \\"Nei\\" Stamatiu-Culianu, also a Junimea man. A sister of theirs, Maria Nanu, was the wife of landowner Gheorghe Nanu‚Äîmaking Paul Jr a first cousin of poet D. Nanu. The elder Zarifopol managed the estates of Moldavian Prince Mihail Sturdza in Criste»ôti. It was there that he and Elena met. According to scholar Elena VulcƒÉnescu, it is possible that Paul Jr was not his natural son, but born to Elena from a liaison with General Grigore Sturdza, heir to the Sturdza estate. Zarifopol eventually bought for himself the baroque manor and Sturdza property at C√¢rligi, near Roman, then a townhouse in Ia»ôi, where he and Stamatiu-Culianu managed Borta Rece tavern. Elena VulcƒÉnescu, \\"La un portret inedit al junimistului »òtefan Stamatiu-Culianu zis Nei\\", in Convorbiri Literare, March 2012 His brothers George and »òtefan Zarifopol both had careers in local politics‚Äîthe former, a Paris-trained agronomist, as a Prefect, the latter as a delegate to Chamber. Paul Sr was the great-uncle of poet Dimitrie Anghel; another of his nephews, Alexandru Zarifopol, was the adoptive father of writer Alexandru Paleologu. Tudorel Urian, \\"Familia Paleologu: ipoteze, legende, fantezii (II)\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 45/2009 Paul Sr died in 1881,SƒÉndulescu, p. 408 leaving Stamatiu in charge of family affairs. Their family fortune helped finance both sides of the family, and the Culianu children were all educated abroad. Paul Jr himself graduated from Junimeas Institutele-Unite private high school,CƒÉlinescu, p. 910 followed by the literature faculty of Ia»ôi University, from 1892 to 1898.Mircea Muthu, \\"Zarifopol Paul\\", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, Vol. II, pp. 868‚Äì869.

He made his published debut in Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol's Arhiva in 1897, with a review of a historiographical work by Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville.Rodica Florea, \\"Reviste »ôi scriitori √Æn ultimele douƒÉ decenii ale secolului al XIX-lea\\", in »òerban Cioculescu, Ovidiu Papadima, Alexandru Piru (eds.), Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne. III: Epoca marilor clasici, p. 975. Bucharest: Editura Academiei, 1973. In 1899, he wrote a short story, Povestea Mo»ôului (\\"The Tale of the Old Man\\"). Well-liked by his literary friends Gheorghe T. Kirileanu and Paul Bujor, it was published in Carmen Sylva magazine under the pen name of \\"Z.\\".Cristina BƒÉdarƒÉ, \\"G. T. Kirileanu √Æn colec»õiile Bibliotecii Centrale Universitare Carol I\\", in Revista Bibliotecii Na»õionale a Rom√¢niei, Nr. 2/2006, pp. 46, 50 In 1902, Zarifopol's professor, Alexandru Philippide, took him on as an assistant and considered him for a likely successor; Zarifopol excused himself, and recommended the Jewish intellectual Heimann Hariton Tiktin for that position. As he noted, Tiktin was more qualified, despite being targeted by a \\"rather violent antisemitic current\\".Lucian NastasƒÉ, Antisemitismul universitar √Æn Rom√¢nia (1919-1939), pp. 47‚Äì48. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Institutului pentru Studierea Problemelor MinoritƒÉ»õilor Na»õionale, 2011, Instead, Zarifopol left for Germany to specialize in philology (under Hermann Suchier),NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 295 and philosophy, as a student of Alois Riehl's objectivist worldview.Florian, p. 171 He took a doctorate at the University of Halle in 1904, with a dissertation on trouv√®re Richard de Fournival. Caragiale companion On April 25, 1903, at Berlin, Zarifopol married »òtefania (Fany) Dobrogeanu- Gherea, the daughter of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. Zarifopol was an atheist;Eugen Simion, \\"Nicolae Steinhardt\\", in Caiete Critice, Nr. 1‚Äì2/2007, p. 10 Fany was Jewish, and, like Zarifopol, a religious nonconformist. The couple turned up at the marriage registrar in street clothes and neither held a church wedding nor baptized their children; all this outraged his mother, a strict Romanian Orthodox.SƒÉndulescu, p. 407 Dobrogeanu-Gherea, a literary critic, and his son Alexandru were also Marxist doctrinaires; Alexandru's daughter, also called Fany, was married to Ion Luca Caragiale's son Luca (Luki).CƒÉlinescu, pp. 710, 1017 While visiting his in-laws, Zarifopol met various figures of international socialism, including revolutionist Karl Radek. Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, \\"Un stilist al ideilor: Paul Zarifopol »ôi snobismul mesianic\\", in LaPunkt, July 21, 2014 The Zarifopols had two children: daughter Sonia (born 1904), and son Paul (born 1905). Selling their C√¢rligi home in 1906, the new family settled in Leipzig, where Paul developed a friendship with Caragiale the elder, who frequently visited from Berlin; with Dimitrie Gusti and Panait Cerna, he is described by Caragiale biographers as the comedic writer's closest Romanian friends in old age,CƒÉlinescu, p. 495; Iosifescu, p. 319 or even, with an affinity in \\"sneering spirits\\", as his one true friend.Constantinescu, p. 278 The relationship proved decisive in Zarifopol's evolution as a critic, but also left a trace on Caragiale's style: Zarifopol introduced him to the work of Anatole France.Iosifescu, p. 342 Until Caragiale's death in 1912, he and Zarifopol pursued a steady correspondence. Sometimes involving kitsch postcards they each collected for their involuntary humor,»òtefan Cazimir, Caragiale fa»õƒÉ cu kitschul. Bucharest: Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, 1988, p. 103. such exchanges were noted for witticisms and ridicule of traditional writers. They also shed light on Caragiale's intellectual, psychological, and artistic evolution, making Zarifopol a prime reference in that field.Iosifescu, pp. 322, 326, 327‚Äì329, 339, 344, 345, 351, 352, 355, 358 Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Dionisie Ghermani Sr, and Zarifopol (top row, from the right), vacationing in Sinaia in 1908. Fany and Sonia Zarifopol are kneeling to Zarifopol's left; Paul the younger is front row, held in her arms by pianist Maria Cernovodeanu From 1908 to 1911, Zarifopol contributed to the Munich-based S√ºddeutsche Monatshefte. Also a correspondent for the Romanian literary press, his writing broke with the older canons of Romanian literary criticism and brought him to the attention of Dobrogeanu-Gherea disciple Garabet IbrƒÉileanu. Co-opted by the latter to write for Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Zarifopol made himself known for sarcastic comments about modernist literature, describing Proust, Gide, and Cocteau as difficult \\"boys and children\\".Iorga, p. 314 Instead, he persuaded IbrƒÉileanu to publish there a novel written in collaborations by two of his brothers-in- law, Luki and Ionel Gherea. Ioana P√¢rvulescu, \\"√én numele fiului\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 10/2001 Together with the latter, he also supervised the debut of a female novelist, Lucia Demetrius. Lucia Demetrius, \\"Memorii\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 4/2004 In 1915, Zarifopol and his family returned to Romania. By then, World War I had broken out, with Romania settled in uneasy neutrality until 1916. For much of that interval, Zarifopol was a literary contributor for Tudor Arghezi's Cronica, but did not necessarily share the magazine's radical stances, nor its anti-war \\"Germanophilia\\".Lucian Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\". Elita intelectualƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ √Æn anii Primului RƒÉzboi Mondial, p. 103. Bucharest: Humanitas, 2010. ; Iorga, p. 212 During the campaigns of 1916‚Äì1917, Zarifopol and his family remained in Ia»ôi; all of southern Romania fell to the Germans. For a while, accepting IbrƒÉileanu's offer, he returned to his alma mater as a substitute professor, replacing C. Fedele»ô (presumed missing in action). Upon Fedele»ô's unexpected return, Zarifopol was sacked.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 295‚Äì296 In late 1916, the family took refuge in Russia, settling for a while in Moscow, but were driven out by the October Revolution. Interwar losses and recovery Described by historian Lucian NastasƒÉ as a withdrawn, \\"neurasthenic\\" and \\"very impractical\\" person,NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 296 Zarifopol was financially ruined in the monetary devaluation that took place after the war. He supported himself by turning to regular journalism, but still had trouble making ends meet (though he did not admit to it), and made efforts to keep away from the centers of culture, living mostly in provincial Sinaia. Zarifopol, sometimes using the pen names PZ and Anton Gherman,Mihail Straje, Dic»õionar de pseudonime, anonime, anagrame, astronime, criptonime ale scriitorilor »ôi publici»ôtilor rom√¢ni, p. 805. Bucharest: Editura Minerva, 1973. returned as one of the main columnists at Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ and its satellite, AdevƒÉrul Literar »ôi Artistic. Despite his material difficulties, Zarifopol categorically refused IbrƒÉileanu and Petre Andrei's offers to take a professorate at Ia»ôi. In early 1920, he complained that the \\"endless infirmities of my children, my wife, and myself\\" prevented him from publishing his cultural journalism as an academic volume, which would have qualified him for the office. In 1924, Zarifopol informed his protectors that he now had \\"a holy terror of officialdom\\", and that he resented Ia»ôi for its support for the National-Christian Defense League, a form of \\"nationalist imbecility and charlatanry\\". As he noted: \\"all things considered, I can make a living from journalism alone.\\"NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 375 A guest writer at Camil Petrescu's SƒÉptƒÉm√¢na IntelectualƒÉ »ôi ArtisticƒÉ in 1924,Sdrobi»ô, p. 311 and, in 1925, at Cuv√¢ntul Liber,Lovinescu (1926), p. 276 Zarifopol became more deeply involved in the cultural debates of Greater Romania. This was the time of his explicit emancipation from Dobrogeanu-Gherea's left-wing didacticism and from IbrƒÉileanu's Poporanism. Didactic and social art, Zarifopol contended, had no real artistic value, and politics were irrelevant in assessing the quality of artistic endeavor. Revising some of his earlier pronouncements on modernism, he now believed in art for art's sake, illustrated by such qualities as \\"pleasure\\", \\"amusement\\", \\"life\\", \\"drama\\", \\"color\\", \\"strange sensibilities\\", or \\"childish delirium\\".Lovinescu (1926), pp. 273‚Äì276 His refusal of didactic art aimed higher, showing up in his celebrated essay on Tolstoy's Kreutzer Sonata.Dima, pp. 170‚Äì171, 176 Working from Sinaia, Zarifopol translated and prefaced an anthology of fantasy short stories, published in 1924 as Vedenii (\\"Visions\\"). Part of his essays were published as Din registrul ideilor ginga»ôe (\\"A Register of Tender Ideas\\", 1926), Despre stil (\\"On Style\\", 1928), Arti»ôti »ôi idei literare rom√¢ne (\\"Artists and Ideas in Romanian Literature\\", 1930), and √éncercƒÉri de precizie literarƒÉ (\\"Essays in Literary Precision\\", 1931).CƒÉlinescu, p. 1025; Grinea Mironescu, p. 8 Zarifopol's dissidence was admonished by other Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ veterans IbrƒÉileanu and Mihai Ralea. IbrƒÉileanu took in some of Zarifopol's criticism, but argued that some of Poporanism's theories were rehabilitated in psychologism or social determinism, without which \\"an artwork can never hope to be fully understood\\".CrohmƒÉlniceanu, pp. 141‚Äì142 The magazine's literary columnists even accused Zarifopol of committing a \\"crime\\" against taste at AdevƒÉrul Literar »ôi Artistic, where Zarifopol was introducing aestheticist guidelines, albeit with contributions that remained \\"interesting and profound\\".CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 135 Nonetheless, Zarifopol's derision of traditionalism and mysticism showed lasting similarities with Ralea's philosophical stances. In 1928, Ralea, Zarifopol, D. I. Suchianu, Felix Aderca and other literati were lumped together as the \\"irresponsible malcontents\\", in a neotraditionalist pamphlet put out by Petre Pandrea and G√¢ndirea magazine.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 89 In his replies, Zarifopol noted that he did not reject mysticism as a cultural phenomenon, only objecting to the \\"career mysticism\\" of traditionalist ideologues.Z. Ornea, Anii treizeci. Extrema dreaptƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ, p. 77. Bucharest: Editura Funda»õiei Culturale Rom√¢ne, 1995. Contested by young and old critics alike, Zarifopol found himself a follower with Mihail Sebastian, who honored him as \\"a lucid man in a time of visionaries\\", \\"a sober teetotaler during a raging drinking bout\\". Diana P√Ærvan-Jenaru, \\"Mihail Sebastian »ôi arta de a polemiza\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 393, October 2007 Zarifopol's cultural role, Sebastian wrote, was that of a \\"policeman\\", a \\"reactionary\\", who would curb the excesses of mysticism, TrƒÉirism, and nationalism. Ioan Stanomir, \\"Semne pe un dulap cu cƒÉr»õi\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 931, January 2008 Final creative period and death Zarifopol eventually moved to Bucharest in 1928, taking up residence on Strada SpƒÉtarului, Mo»ôilor.Lazu, pp. 82, 328 Slowly discarding social and literary criticism in favor of philology,Constantinescu, p. 264 he worked on a critical edition of Caragiale's works; he put out the first three volumes (1930, 1931, 1932), winning a prize from the Romanian Writers' Society. In March 1929, together with Gala Galaction, Nicolae L. Lupu and others, he put out the monthly magazine Hanul Samariteanului, which only published a single issue.Desa et al., p. 491 Later that year, he became a writer for Isac Ludo's mainly Jewish review, Adam,Camelia CrƒÉciun, \\"Presa culturalƒÉ evreiascƒÉ din Rom√¢nia √Æn timpul Holocaustului: cazul revistei Adam\\", in Anca Ciuciu, Camelia CrƒÉciun (eds.), Istorie »ôi memorie evreiascƒÉ.

See also CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 345; Desa et al., p. 17 and, in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, published his review of Immanuel Kant's aesthetics (Kant »ôi estetica).Dima, p. 171 His other contributions appeared in various new magazines and newspapers, including AdevƒÉrul (which in 1927 hosted his humorous memoir of a meeting with Radek), Dreptatea, Kalende, Lamura, Gazeta FƒÉlticenilor, and Ancheta.Desa et al., pp. 38‚Äì39, 330, 433, 557, 571 He carried on with his lampoons of traditionalism, publishing, in 1932, an especially mordant portrait of historian Vasile P√¢rvan, Plicticoase fantome (\\"Tedious Apparitions\\"). Alexandru George, \\"Cu c√¢t pierdem un mit...\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 18/2009 He was also involved with Criterion, a debate club for political and cultural factions, one of the \\"old men\\" who were called upon as both arbiters and active participants. He and Ralea were thus present when the debates about Gide, Lenin, Sigmund Freud, and Charlie Chaplin either degenerated into squabbles or were broken up by the far-right Defense League. Irina Manea, \\"Criterion ‚Äì o istorie\\", in Historia, May 2014 In 1933, Zarifopol was named editor-in-chief of Revista Funda»õiilor Regale,Grinea Mironescu, p. 8 the official literary magazine, which was largely conceived by him.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 171 In February 1934, he was involved with Convorbiri Literare in round- table talks that were supposed to revive Criterion. These projects ended abruptly when Zarifopol died of a heart attack on May 1, at 12 AM,CƒÉlinescu, p. 909 allegedly while visiting his mistress, musicologist Lisette Georgescu.Mihail Sebastian, Journal, 1935-1944. London: Random House, 2003, p. 59. His body was cremated on May 3,NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 475 with Camil Petrescu succeeding him at Revista Funda»õiilor Regale. His most important work as a literary critic appeared posthumously in 1934; called Pentru arta literarƒÉ (\\"For Literary Art\\"), it was praised by Sebastian as \\"a model of precise understanding of values and of their order\\". In 1935, »òerban Cioculescu put out a critical edition of the Caragiale‚ÄìZarifopol correspondence, while editing new volumes from the Caragiale corpus, which Zarifopol had begun publishing.Constantinescu, pp. 239, 269‚Äì270, 277. See also CƒÉlinescu, p. 1001; Iosifescu, p. 360 Work Generic traits Once settled in his role as art for art's sake advocate, Zarifopol created himself a confrontational niche, earning both respect and bewilderment from his readers. A traditionalist adversary, Nicolae Iorga, recognized Zarifopol as a \\"refined and daring thinker\\",Iorga, p. 212 while his Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ partner Ralea called him \\"charming and irritating\\".Ralea, p. 171 Ralea identified in him \\"a freethinker\\" with \\"the courage of looking truth in the face\\", but essentially a \\"freezing intelligence\\" of \\"destructive anarchism\\", a man \\"alone within his sarcasm\\".Ralea, pp. 162‚Äì164 A more virulent review came from classicist George CƒÉlinescu, who proposed that Zarifopol's one original note was \\"continuous and systematic persiflage, to the point of annoyance\\". He attributed such traits to Zarifopol's familiarity with \\"two sophistic races\\", Greeks and Jews, his claim in turn criticized by RaleaLucian Boia, Capcanele istoriei. Elita intelectualƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ √Æntre 1930 »ôi 1950. Bucharest: Humanitas, 2012, p. 243. and philosopher Mircea FlorianFlorian, p. 169 for its racialist undertones. Florian also discussed the constructive side of Zarifopol's work, arguing that accusations of \\"bourgeois anarchism\\" and \\"iconoclasm\\" were prejudiced.Florian, pp. 169, 170 Another sympathetic reviewer, Andreea Grinea Mironescu, sees CƒÉlinescu's pronouncements as \\"minimizing and petty.\\" Eugen Lovinescu, the modernist literary theorist, shared Zarifopol's overall aesthetic goals, but not his methods: Zarifopol, he writes, was an unlikely follower of Titu Maiorescu's non-didactic school of \\"aesthetic autonomy\\" and authenticity, which had emerged at Junimea in the 1860s, and had also influenced Caragiale.Lovinescu (1943), pp. 289, 291 In 1941, Nicolae Bagdasar identified in Zarifopol \\"a vastly cultured critic, of a rare subtlety and fine irony\\", lamenting that his work \\"remains scattered in so many magazines\\".Nicolae Bagdasar, \\"Estetica\\", in Nicolae Bagdasar, Traian Herseni, S. S. B√¢rsƒÉnescu (eds.), Istoria filosofiei moderne, V. Filosofia rom√¢neascƒÉ dela origini p√¢nƒÉ astƒÉzi, p. 253. Bucharest: Romanian Philosophical Society, 1941 However, as argued by colleague Pompiliu Constantinescu, this improvidence was a fundamental trait and shortcoming of Zarifopol's literary contribution: his was a \\"newspaperman's critique\\" of \\"spontaneous impression, quick analysis, and incomplete assessment, meaning that he could never embrace a creator in all their complexity.\\" The same was noted by CƒÉlinescu, who argues that Zarifopol's \\"journalistic method\\" relied on explicit appeals to popularity and spurious accuracy.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 910‚Äì911 Lovinescu assessed that Zarifopol's criticism \\"lingers in the paradox\\", always placing itself \\"at the antipodes of common sense\\": denying merit to prestigious figures such as Renan or Maupassant, but praising Ion Minulescu as an outstanding novelist. His \\"practical\\" verdicts, Lovinescu notes, remain \\"disoriented\\", \\"regrettable\\".Lovinescu (1926), pp. 272‚Äì273 He acknowledges Zarifopol's \\"stylistic rigor\\", but concludes that his is \\"an equation in which the unknown is better left unknown\\",Lovinescu (1926), pp. 276‚Äì277 something \\"virtually alien to the rhythms of our literary movement.\\"Lovinescu (1943), p. 289 The same was argued decades later by Lovinescu disciple Nicolae Manolescu.Grinea Mironescu, pp. 8, 9 According to Ralea, Zarifopol should be read as a Romanian counterpart of anti-populist \\"lone travelers\\", from Barbey d'Aurevilly and Edgar Allan Poe to Hanns Heinz Ewers, often applauding causes that were \\"at odds with the establishment\\".Ralea, pp. 159‚Äì161 Thus, responding to the established literary canons, Zarifopol fashioned himself an alternative one, comprising Caragiale, Minulescu, Proust and Cocteau, but also Joseph Delteil, Henri de R√©gnier, Adrian Maniu, PƒÉstorel Teodoreanu,Lovinescu (1926), pp. 275‚Äì276. See also BalotƒÉ, p. 215; Grinea Mironescu, p. 9; Zalis, pp. 8‚Äì9 and Drago»ô Protopopescu.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 376 CƒÉlinescu believes that Zarifopol was most \\"intelligent\\" in his essays on Proust and Gustave Flaubert, where he overcame his usual \\"journalistic banality\\".CƒÉlinescu, p. 911 Aesthetic ideals Zarifopol's rejection of neoclassicism, from Goethe to Dimitrie Bolintineanu, but also his friend Panait Cerna, had to do with both its \\"mechanic\\" use of poetic imagery and its communication of \\"bland truths\\".BalotƒÉ, pp. 215‚Äì218, 222‚Äì223 He preferred archaic Moldavian forms, that he found resonating in the poetry of Dosoftei and Vasile Alecsandri.Zalis, pp. 7, 8 CƒÉlinescu was especially critical of Zarifopol literal and \\"negativist\\" reading of Alexandru Vlahu»õƒÉ's Din prag, which ridiculed the poet's presentment of death eternal.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 909‚Äì910 Such a sustained attack, equated by comparatist Nicolae BalotƒÉ with \\"a holocaust of poetry\\",BalotƒÉ, p. 223 nevertheless impressed Lovinescu. The latter declared himself in agreement with the thesis that ancient models were perishable, and that traditionalist art was implicitly false.Lovinescu (1926), p. 273; (1943), pp. 290‚Äì291 Seen by Alexandru Paleologu as a more radical anti-classicist than Zarifopol ever was,Grinea Mironescu, p. 9 Lovinescu noted in 1943: \\"as modernism or synchronism, I have been supporting those same ideas these past twenty years.\\"Lovinescu (1943), p. 291 Zarifopol's revolt was more contextual, and bound by his own debt to the classics: Ralea sees him as a classical rationalist in the manner of Voltaire, Sainte-Beuve, and Anatole France,Ralea, pp. 162, 168, 170 and CƒÉlinescu as a \\"cultured academic, for all his freethinking airs\\", copying his style from Caragiale and Tudor Arghezi, without \\"a sense of the sublime\\".CƒÉlinescu, pp. 909, 910 BalotƒÉ also finds Zarifopol a \\"suppressed scholar\\", \\"in denial of his formative background\\".BalotƒÉ, p. 214 CƒÉlinescu sees Zarifopol a man of little classical culture, his \\"obviously German method\\" being more akin to the sociology of literature. Such verdicts were nuanced by another literary historian, Alexandru Dima, who suggests that Zarifopol did have contribution to the scholarly study of aesthetics, one which \\"imposes itself even against his own wish.\\"Dima, p. 170 Zarifopol's rejection of scientism and historicism had deep roots in Junimism and neo-Kantianism, but Zarifopol also criticized Kantian assumptions about the sublime, finding them too indebted to ethical imperatives.Dima, pp. 171‚Äì175; Lovinescu (1943), p. 289 As noted by Dima, his attachment to phenomenology was \\"at the very least formal\\".Dima, p. 175 According to BalotƒÉ, his applications of the art for art's sake principle show that, despite his own claims to the contrary, Zarifopol borrowed his poetics from Henri Br√©mond, Paul Val√©ry, and St√©phane Mallarm√©.BalotƒÉ, pp. 218‚Äì221 Social critic Revisiting Zarifopol's moralizing essays in 2007, critic Henri Zalis found him to be \\"chaste and meticulous, and in this unmatched.\\"Zalis, p. 6 Din registrul ideilor ginga»ôe, is, according to Lovinescu, an \\"interesting intellectual spectacle of deliberate originality\\". This is one of several essays containing Zarifopol's Junimea-like satire of inauthentic mofturi (\\"trifles\\" or \\"coquetries\\", a term echoing Caragiale), including wholesale borrowings of foreign customs that respond to bourgeois tastes.CƒÉlinescu, p. 909; Lovinescu (1943), pp. 290‚Äì292; Ralea, pp. 160‚Äì161, 167‚Äì171 The eponymous \\"tender ideas\\" were defined by Zarifopol as \\"those which should be familiar to any man wishing to pass for cultured, and also those that said man must be careful to speak about just so, lest he insult the views of society\\"; the book was addressed to those skeptics who, rejecting cultural crazes, \\"still value consistency\\". Cassian Maria Spiridon, \\"Ideile ginga»ôe »ôi actualitatea lor contondentƒÉ\\", in Convorbiri Literare, March 2013 As Ralea notes, Zarifopol's anti-ideological critique, continuing the work of Caragiale, was specifically deriding philosophers and philosophies that were the height of fashion: mystical, Bergsonian, Japonist;Ralea, pp. 161, 167‚Äì168, 170‚Äì171 other such hobbyhorses were Nietzscheism and psychoanalysis. CƒÉlinescu was unimpressed by Zarifopol's \\"rather belated\\" satire of bourgeois mores, since \\"the bourgeois is no longer that ridiculous conservative figure\\". Yet, Zarifopol was not entirely anti-middle class: he believed his type of \\"cold lucidity\\" was primarily an in-built antidote to the decay of the \\"colossal civilization\\" that was liberal society.Florian, pp. 170‚Äì171; Ralea, p. 170 He issued what Florian calls a \\"passionate call to order of the bourgeoisie, [which is] still a bearer of cultural values.\\"Florian, p. 170 Himself a conservative, Zarifopol expressed his nostalgia for old-regime social differentiation and division of labor, against \\"the political type\\", and for the nuclear family of patriarchy, against the \\"neutralization\\" of fathers in modern society. He criticizes both Francophilia and Germanophilia, noting that, although competing, they each supported deindividuation: the former, through corporatism; the latter, through militarism. While targeting philistinism, Din registrul... is itself an antiintellectualist manifesto. Zarifopol contended that intellectuals were an illusory social class (no economic interest bound together \\"a lawyer with a novelist\\"), but still collectively responsible for the failures of a society such as Romania's.Sdrobi»ô, pp. 312‚Äì313 Zarifopol took distance from more radical antiintelectualist stances, communist as well as Christian; but also noted that natural disunity between intellectuals meant that communist terrorism was itself an intellectuals' affair.Sdrobi»ô, pp. 313‚Äì314 Both Din registrul... and other writings show him as an anti-Soviet in line with Nikolai Berdyaev, and believed that Leninism was a somewhat worrisome, but generally puerile, non- philosophy. Like fascism and, historically, Bonapartism, it stood for a \\"simplistic autocratic drive\\" and \\"stupefied blindness\\". Moreover, Zarifopol rejected Marxist literary criticism, with its discourse of base and superstructure, seeing it as the source of modernist kitsch. In 2014, posthumously reviewing Zarifiopol's anticommunist notes, scholar Vladimir TismƒÉneanu described him as a diagnostician of \\"totalitarian reflexes\\", displaying \\"urbanity, civility, moderation and firmness\\". Evidence also exists that, beyond this public persona, Zarifopol was more illiberal. Prolonging his antihumanist tendencies,Ralea, p. 170 he expressed in private his reserves for the \\"deplorable\\" literature of \\"the oppressed\\", including Jews, social climbers, and especially women; according to NastasƒÉ, he was an antifeminist, and perhaps also a misogynist.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 49‚Äì50 In 1932, writer Barbu Brezianu suggested that Zarifopol was on the \\"far-right\\" of Romanian literature, in the \\"grand conservative party\\" of D. Nanu, Cincinat Pavelescu, Mihail Sadoveanu, and Al. T. Stamatiad. Barbu Brezianu, \\"Curs de literaturƒÉ politicƒÉ\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, February 2008 Legacy Fany Zarifopol, born in 1876, lived until 1945. Paul Jr spent seventeen years as a political prisoner under the communist regime, being released with a general amnesty in 1964. Officially designating him a \\"bourgeois idealist\\",S.

RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Nr. 1/1965, p. 201 communist censorship prevented Zarifopol's essays from being either reprinted or quoted before the mid 1960s liberalization. When they were finally returned to circulation, large parts of his work were still being bracketed out.Monica Lovinescu, Unde scurte, p. 146. Bucharest: Humanitas, 1990. ; Grinea Mironescu, p. 8 Sonia Zarifopol, who never married, was a lover of literature and, in the 1930s, a discreet presence at Lovinescu's SburƒÉtorul society.

She died in 1981, and her brother three years later; neither had children of their own. George Zarifopol's son, Constantin Radu \\"Dinu\\", was a published novelist.

A linguist and comparatist, she taught at Indiana University Bloomington, marrying Anglicist Kenneth R. Johnston. She was joined there by her sister Christina Zarifopol-Illias, who organized the Bloomington Romanian Studies Program. The critical reappraisal of Zarifopol, begun by Eugen Simion in 1956, was taken up in the 1980s by Paleologu and Marin Mincu.Grinea Mironescu, pp. 8‚Äì9 In underground culture, his memory was cultivated by the essayist Nicolae Steinhardt. Although a fervent Orthodox, he viewed the non-believers Zarifopol and Ralea as intellectual standards, praising their \\"quick wit\\". From 1971, Al. SƒÉndulescu was allowed to publish selections of Zarifopol's literary prose, and, in 1987, Zarifopol's correspondence (at Editura Minerva, with samples in Manuscriptum magazine).NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 50, 206, 247, 296, 359, 369, 427 A more thorough recovery came after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, when more complete anthologies first emerged, and Zarifopol monographs were published by Alex. Cistelecan. In 1992, his formerly censored critique of socialism was issued by Editura Albatros as a standalone book, Marxism amuzant (\\"Amusing Marxism\\").

Life in Istanbul to 1914  øAlƒ´ ·∏§aydar, the son of Sharif  øAlƒ´ JƒÅbir PƒÅshƒÅ, was born in April 1866 in a yalƒ± belonging to his grandfather, Sharif ‚ÄòAbd al-Muttalib, formerly Emir of Mecca, in the Kanlƒ±ca neighborhood of Istanbul (Constantinople). He was an Arab, a member of the Dhawu Zayd, a clan of the Banu Qatada tribe. In 1879 ‚ÄòAbd al-Muttalib was appointed Emir of Mecca for the third time and  øAlƒ´ ·∏§aydar was sent as a hostage to Istanbul, where he eventually settled in the √áamlƒ±ca Hill district. In 1887 he was made a member of the Council of State with the rank of bala.  øAlƒ´ ·∏§aydar's first wife was Sabiha Hanƒ±m, a Turkish woman. With her he had one daughter, ≈ûerife Nimet Hanƒ±m, and three sons. Their eldest son was Sharif Damat Muhammed Abd√ºlmecid Beyefendi, educated in Britain, who married the Ottoman princess Rukiye Sultan, a daughter of ≈ûehzade Mehmed Selaheddin, son of Murad V. Their second son, ≈ûerif Muhiddin Targan, became a musician and married Safiye Ayla. Their third son was ≈ûerif Muhammed Emin Bey.  øAlƒ´ ·∏§aydar's second wife was an Irishwoman, Isobel Duncan, who converted to Islam and took the name Fatima. She bore him two daughters ≈ûerife S√ºfeyme Hanƒ±m and ≈ûerife Musbah Hanƒ±m and one son ≈ûerif Faisal Bey. ·∏§aydar was widely considered an anglophile before the war; he was also a pan-Islamist with close ties to Indian Muslims. In 1908, he was passed over for the Emirate and it was instead given to ·∏§usayn ibn  øAlƒ´, who was older but belonged to the junior Dhawu Awn clan of the Banu Qatada. ·∏§aydar, who was considered a liberal on good terms with the Committee of Union and Progress government, was infuriated. In Istanbul, he served for many years as the naqib al-ashraf, representative of the Hejazi clans. He served as Minister of Waqfs (charitable endowments) from January 1910 in the cabinet of Grand Vizier Ibrahim Hakki Pasha, but he resigned after some time and was replaced by Mustafa Hayri Bey. He also sat for a time in the Imperial Senate. In 1911 the President of the Senate Mehmed Said Pasha was appointed Grand Vizier. Vice-President of the Senate Ahmed Muhtar Pasha was appointed President and  øAlƒ´ ·∏§aydar was appointed Vice-President. Most of his descendants live in Turkey and took the surname Targan after the Surname Law. Life in Medina during World War I There were rumours upon the Ottoman entry into the world war (1914) that ·∏§usayn ibn  øAlƒ´ would be replaced by ·∏§aydar, but nothing happened for two years. On 10 June 1916, ·∏§usayn openly rebelled. Within days, the Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha had invited  øAlƒ´ ·∏§aydar by telegram to replace ·∏§usayn and the Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, had visited him at his home to confirm the offer. According to his own account, ·∏§aydar reminded Said Halim of their families' intertwined history: \\"The fall of my own family and the rise of the Aoun, to which ·∏§usayn belongs, was entirely due to Mohammed Ali. You are his grandson and I am the great- grandson of Sherif Ghalib whom he deposed. Now God has given you the opportunity to rectify and redeem the crime of your grandfather.\\" In June, ·∏§aydar's agent in Jeddah, Ahmed el-Hezazi, was arrested and his house looted by orders of ·∏§usayn. On 2 July 1916, ·∏§usayn was formally dismissed as emir of Mecca and on 16 July, Sultan Mehmed V issued an irad√© appointing  øAlƒ´ ·∏§aydar in his place. On 19 July,  øAlƒ´ ·∏§aydar was seen off at the Haydarpa≈üa railway station by the entire cabinet and the future sultan Mehmed VI. Accompanied by a ceremonial guard of 300 infantry and 25 cavalry, he took a train to Damascus, where he was welcomed by Djemal Pasha. Djemal, who distrusted him, attached Nureddin Bey to his retinue with instructions to kill ·∏§aydar if he tried to contact the British. On 29 July, ·∏§aydar's party left Damascus; it arrived in Medina, which was being held by Fakhri Pasha against the rebels, on 1 August. On 9 August, ·∏§aydar issued a proclamation in response to ·∏§usayn's earlier publicly circulated letter: > The enemy has invaded Egypt, the Sudan and India, Yemen, Ahkaf, Oman and > vicinity, and this time he made an attempt on Basra. [...] El Sherif Hessein > leagues himself with that enemy, and is now trying to place the House of > God, the Kibla of Islam, and the tomb of the prophet, under the protection > of a Christian Government, at war with the Turkish Government. and doing > what it can to subjugate all Moslem nations [...] The British translated it and published it in their intelligence bulletin, but its publication in India and Egypt was forbidden. ·∏§aydar meanwhile secured the allegiance of the tribes around Medina by bribery. After the Ottoman forces almost captured Mecca in August 1916, they settled down to a siege in Medina. In March 1917 the government ordered the troops withdrawn, but Fakhri Pasha convinced ·∏§aydar to get the order revoked. ·∏§aydar himself left Medina for Damascus that month. He continued to hold the title Emir of Mecca until the office was abolished by imperial decree in 1919.

The Northwest Passage Drive Expedition (NWPDX) (2009-2011) was a multi-stage vehicular expedition from the North American mainland to Devon Island in the high Arctic, by way of the Northwest Passage. The expedition was led by planetary scientist Pascal Lee. Although the expedition was primarily logistical and was not intended to be a high fidelity simulation of a crewed pressurized rover traverse on the Moon or Mars, it was the first long-distance road trip dedicated to planetary exploration studies and provided important lessons for planning future long-range vehicular traverses off Earth. The expedition was also the first crossing of the Northwest Passage in a road vehicle. The first stage of the expedition, NWPDX-2009, established a record for the longest distance driven continuously on sea-ice in a road vehicle: .Lee, P. 2010. Northwest Passage Drive : Preparing for Mars. Above & Beyond ‚Äì Canada‚Äôs Arctic Journal. Sept‚ÄìOct 2010, 35‚Äì39. The expedition‚Äôs main objective was to deliver the Mars Institute's HMP Okarian rover (aka Moon-1 Humvee Rover), a modified Humvee serving as a planetary pressurized rover simulator, from the North American mainland to the Haughton-Mars Project Research Station on Devon Island. Once delivered, the HMP Okarian would be used for research - through simulations of planetary excursion missions - to plan future human Moon and Mars exploration. The Northwest Passage Drive Expedition was proposed by HMP principal investigator Pascal Lee when rover operations on Devon Island using the HMP‚Äôs first Humvee alone, the Mars-1, proved too risky, and a second Humvee (the HMP Okarian) became needed at the HMP site. The expedition‚Äôs secondary objectives were scientific: to measure the thickness of the sea-ice along the Northwest Passage to document Climate change in the Arctic; to quantify the potential microbial forward contamination of future pressurized rover traverses on the Moon and Mars;Schuerger, A. C. & P. Lee 2015. Microbial Ecology of a Crewed Rover Traverse in the Arctic: Low Microbial Dispersal and Implications for Planetary Protection on Human Mars Missions. Astrobiology, 15, 6, 478-491. and to study the logistics of planning and implementing pressurized rover traverses on the Moon and Mars. The expedition was supported by NASA, the Mars Institute, and the SETI Institute. Other government agencies (Air National Guard, Canadian Space Agency, Nunavut Research Institute, Polar Continental Shelf Project, and others) and private partners (AM General, Bombardier Recreational Products, Mattracks Inc., First Air, and others) provided additional support. Overview The Northwest Passage Drive Expedition took place in three stages over the course of three arctic field seasons, departing Kugluktuk on the North American mainland in April 2009, and ending at the Haughton-Mars Project Research Station on Devon Island in July 2011. The three stages of the expedition are designated NWPDX-2009, NWPDX-2010, and NWPDX-2011. The NWPDX-2009 expedition departed Kugluktuk on 10 April 2009, and reached Cambridge Bay on Victoria Island on 17 April 2009. The HMP Okarian was then flown by the US Air National Guard from Cambridge Bay to Resolute Bay on Cornwallis Island in May 2009. The NWPDX-2010 expedition departed Resolute Bay on 5 May 2010, and reached the West coast of Devon Island on 16 May 2010. The NWPDX-2011 expedition departed the West coast of Devon Island on 18 July 2011, and reached the HMP Research Station on 20 July 2011. The NWPDX-2009 and 2010 expeditions consisted of the HMP Okarian equipped with tracks, and two snowmobiles, each vehicle towing a qamutiik sled loaded with equipment and supplies. The NWPDX-2011 expedition consisted of the HMP Okarian on wheels, escorted by two all-terrain vehicles or quad bikes. Preparations Initial planning of the expedition took place in 2008 and 2009. The HMP Okarian was originally a military ambulance Humvee on loan from AM General to Hollywood where it was featured in many films and TV shows, notably in The Rock (1996). When the Northwest Passage Drive Expedition project was approved, the vehicle was called back to the AM General factory to be refurbished and modified to become the HMP Okarian. Journey NWPDX-2009 The 2009 campaign was led by Lee and included geologist and explorer John Schutt as expedition navigator and field guide, arctic expert Joe Amarualik as expedition scout, vehicle engineer Jesse Weaver as expedition technician, and documentary filmmaker Mark Carroll as cameraman. The expedition departed Kugluktuk on 10 April 2009 but soon encountered difficulties with weather and thick snow cover on the sea-ice which slowed down progress and increased fuel consumption. On 15 April 2009, the HMP Okarian was almost lost in an ice lead incident, but was successfully salvaged by the expedition team. The expedition reached Cambridge Bay on 17 April 2009. The HMP Okarian was subsequently airlifted by the US Air National Guard from Cambridge Bay to Resolute Bay in May 2009. NWPDX-2010 The 2010 campaign was led by Lee and included the same team members as the NWPDX-2009 expedition, plus filmmaker Jean-Christophe Jeauffre as documentary film director. The expedition departed Resolute Bay on 5 May 2010 but the HMP Okarian soon experienced a series of mechanical problems, including the breakage of critical parts on 6 May 2010 and again on 13 May 2010. The expedition was ultimately completed when Lee sent Amarualik back to Resolute Bay solo by snowmobile to retrieve a replacement part, and later Schutt and Weaver to the HMP Research Station on Devon Island, also by snowmobile, to scavenge a replacement part from the Mars-1 Humvee Rover. The expedition, including the HMP Okarian, eventually reached the west coast of Devon Island on 16 May 2010, at a location subsequently named Humvee Beach. NWPDX-2011 The 2011 campaign was led by Lee and included space engineer Robert Mueller of NASA Kennedy Space Center as navigator, vehicle engineer Jesse Weaver as expedition technician, and filmmaker Jody Shapiro as cameraman. The expedition departed Humvee Beach on 18 July 2011, and reached the HMP Research Station on 20 July 2011. Accomplishments Although the expedition experienced a number of challenges, including an instance where the HMP Okarian was almost lost in a sea-ice lead, it was successful in achieving its primary goal of safely delivering the rover to the Haughton-Mars Project Research Station on Devon Island. The expedition was also successful in meeting its secondary goal of collecting new data relating to the planning and implementation of future long-range crewed pressurized rover traverses on the Moon and Mars, including the first field study of the risk of forward contamination during future crewed rover operations.Schuerger, A. C. & P. Lee 2015. Microbial Ecology of a Crewed Rover Traverse in the Arctic: Low Microbial Dispersal and Implications for Planetary Protection on Human Mars Missions. Astrobiology, 15, 6, 478-491. While the HMP Okarian experienced a series mechanical problems during its journey, some requiring that crew members be dispatched to retrieve spare parts and supplies, all such retrievals and repairs were carried out by the expedition crew alone, as a crew on the Moon or Mars would need to were it stranded some distance away from a base or a cache of supplies. Ancillary to its main goals, the expedition achieved the first crossing of the Northwest Passage in a road vehicle. The first stage of the expedition, NWPDX-2009, established a record for the longest distance driven continuously on sea-ice in a road vehicle: .Lee, P. 2010. Northwest Passage Drive : Preparing for Mars. Above & Beyond ‚Äì Canada‚Äôs Arctic Journal. Sept‚ÄìOct 2010, 35‚Äì39. Outreach Okarian Name The HMP Okarian was originally named Moon-1 Humvee Rover and painted yellow, to distinguish it from the red-colored Mars-1 Humvee Rover already is use on the Haughton-Mars Project. The Moon-1 was subsequently renamed Okarian, in reference to the Okarians imagined by Edgar Rice Burroughs in The Warlord of Mars, a race of Yellow Martians who migrated to the North Pole of Mars and lived there in domed cities. Passage To Mars The Northwest Passage Drive Expedition is captured in the documentary film Passage to Mars (2016), directed by Jean-Christophe Jeauffre, and narrated by Zachary Quinto as Pascal Lee.

Abu Hamzah Al-Thumali, who was a companion of three Shia Imams, received it from Ali Zayn al-Abidin and was the principal narrator of the work. This supplication is mentioned in Eqbal al-a‚Äômal ‚Äì a work in Arabic authored by Sayyed Ibn Tawus that included Du'as, prayers, and practices which were recommended to be performed at specific times of the year. It was said that Ali Zayn al-Abidin recited the supplication every evening or dawn during Ramadan. Abu Hamza al-Thumali ThƒÅbit ibn Safiya, known as Abu Hamza al-Thumali, descends from the Safiye family (Arabic: ÿ¢ŸÑ ÿ®ŸÜ€å ÿµŸÅ€åŸá). Born in Kufa, al-Thumali was a companion of three Shia Imams ‚Äì Ali Zayn al-Abidin, Muhammad al-Baqir, and Ja'far al-Sadiq. Although there is little information about his birth, it is believed that he lived in the seventh and eighth centuries. Therefore, it is possible that he was a companion of Imam Kadhim, also. Abu Hamza al-Thumali had great esteem for Imams, and they apparently considered him trustworthy. Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Imam of Shia, stated about him: \\"Abu Hamza in his time was similar to Salman in the prophet's time.\\" Ahmad ibn Ali al-Najashi, a grand scholar of Shia, said: \\"He was the best of our companions and the most reliable of them in narration and tradition.\\" He wrote several works about Islamic subjects such as the Kitab fi Tafsir al-Quran al-Karim (an exegesis of the Quran), Kitab al-Nawadir (a book on the rare things), Kitab al-Zuhd (on asceticism) and Al-Risalah al-Huquq (about all kinds of rights). He died in the year 150 A.H.. Chain of authority Abu Hamzah Al-Thumali is the first person who heard this supplication from Ali Zayn al-Abidin. The supplication is seen in the Eqbal al-A'mal of Sayyed Ibn Tawus, which begins by describing the following chain of authority: its author Sayyed Ibn Tawus stated he received its contents on the authority of Harun ibn Musa ibn Ahmad Talla'ukbara, who received it from Hassan bin Mahboob Srad, who received it from Abu Hamza al- Thimali, who received it from Ali Zayn al-Abidin. Abu Hamzah Al-Thumali was subsequently recognized as a credible narrator of hadith by important Shia scholars such as Najasi, Shaykh Tusi, Ibn Babawayh, and Ibn Shahre Ashub, but Sunni scholars have not confirmed him. Contents The supplication touches on following subjects: # Awareness of Allah ## The inevitably of creatures in the dominion of Allah ## Knowing Allah by himself ## Allah Being guidance # An explanation of ways of bills and salvation for man ## Resorting to the Mercy of Allah ## Practicing moral virtues and avoiding moral vices # Du'a ## Invocation ## Salawat ## Help request # Perseverance (repeated sentence) # A guilty plea # Humility and modesty  Time of recitation  Ali Zayn al- Abidin, the fourth Shia Imam, invoked the supplication of Abu Hamza al-Thimali every night or dawn during Ramadan.  Reception  Many scholars have written explanations for supplication of Abu Hamzah Thumali, including the following: * Shaykh Muhammad Ebrahim ibn al-Mawli abd-Alwahab Sabzevary * Mawla Muhammad Taqi ibn Hussain Ali al-Heravy al-Esfahany al-Hayery (in his book titled Nahayat al-Amal) * Mehdi Bahr al-Ulum (in his book titled Al-Rovzat) * Mohammad-Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi (in his book titled In the sight of Allah) Ayatollah Khomeini advised reciting a passage of the Du'a with feeling and meditating upon its words. He recommended reading the supplication slowly and thinking about it as one reads.

He wrote the Hardwood Code, a telegraphic code then used extensively in the trade, and urged by the Hardwood Manufacturer's Association of the United States. He was also chair of the Nashville board of censorship of moving pictures, and active in the Rotary Club. Early years Hamilton Love was born on December 27, 1875 on his father's farm about three miles from Nashville, Tennessee, the youngest child of James Benton Love and Mary Elizabeth Plummer, named for his grandfather. Love's father James was a coal merchant, a member of the firm of Love & Randle. His mother's father James Ransom Plummer was the mayor of Columbia, Tennessee in 1832, 1833, 1834, 1836, and 1838. Love was thus a descendant of James Ransom, and a relative of Nathaniel Macon and Kemp Plummer Battle. His father's grandmother was a Gannaway, making him also a relative of William Gannaway Brownlow and William Trigg Gannaway. News reporter Love left school at the age of fifteen and worked as a reporter and newswriter for the Nashville Evening Herald. He then got a job writing for the Sunday Times, and later wrote for the Nashville American. Love contributed articles on sports in the South to The Sporting News and Sporting Life. Love was chairman of the local baseball committee, and wrote several articles covering the Nashville Vols. On the 1908 team winning the Southern pennant after defeating New Orleans, Love wrote \\"By one run, by one point, Nashville has won the Southern League pennant, nosing New Orleans out literally by an eyelash. Saturday's game, which was the deciding one, between Nashville and New Orleans was the greatest exhibition of the national game ever seen in the south and the finish in the league race probably sets a record in baseball history\\".

Visvesvara. \\"Free-living Amoebae as Opportunistic and Non- opportunistic Pathogens of Humans and Animals.\\" International Journal for Parasitology 34.9 (2004): 1001‚Äì1027. Web. It is a free-living, bacteria-eating microorganism that can be pathogenic, causing an extremely rare sudden and severe and fatal brain infection called naegleriasis, also known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. This microorganism is typically found in bodies of warm freshwater, such as ponds, lakes, rivers, hot springs, warm water discharge from industrial or power plants, geothermal well water, poorly maintained or minimally chlorinated (under 0.5 mg/m3 residual) swimming pools, water heaters, soil, and pipes connected to tap water. It can be seen in either an amoeboid or temporary flagellate stage. The naegleriasis infection has been documented in Australia in 1965, Czechoslovakia in 1962 to 1965, USA in 2003, 2011, 2013, and 2020, and Pakistan in 2008. Etymology The organism was named after Malcolm Fowler, an Australian pathologist at Adelaide Children's Hospital, who was the first author of the original series of case reports of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. Life cycle Biotic phases: cyst, trophozoite, flagellate Naegleria fowleri is a thermophilic, free-living amoeba. It is found in warm and hot freshwater ponds, lakes and rivers, and in the very warm water of hot springs. As the water temperature rises, its numbers increase. The amoeba was identified in the 1960s in Australia but appears to have evolved in the United States. N. fowleri occurs in three forms ‚Äì as a cyst, a trophozoite (ameboid), and a biflagellate. It does not form a cyst in human tissue, where only the amoeboid trophozoite stage exists. The flagellate form can exist in the cerebrospinal fluid. Cyst stage The cyst form is the storage-state of this amoeba. It is spherical and about 7‚Äì15 ¬µm in diameter. It is smooth, having a single-layered wall with a single nucleus. A Cyst is a life-capsule resistant to adverse environmental- conditions. Trophozoites encyst due to unfavorable conditions. Factors that induce cyst formation include a lack of food, overcrowding, desiccation, accumulation of waste products, and cold temperatures. When conditions improve, the amoeba can escape through the pore, or ostiole, seen in the middle of the cyst. N. fowleri has been found to encyst at temperatures below . Trophozoite stage The trophozoite is the feeding, dividing, and infective stage for humans. The trophozoite attaches to olfactory epithelium, where it follows the olfactory cell axon through the cribriform plate (in the nasal cavity) to the brain. This reproductive stage of the protozoan organism, which transforms near 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F) and grows best around 42 ¬∞C (106.7 ¬∞F), proliferates by binary fission. The trophozoites are characterized by a nucleus and a surrounding halo. They travel by pseudopodia, which means that they extend parts of their body's cell membrane (the pseudopods) and then fill them with protoplasm to force locomotion. The pseudopods form at different points along the cell, thus allowing the trophozoite to change directions. In their free-living state, trophozoites feed on bacteria. In tissues, it appears they phagocytize (consume by enclosing and then digesting prey) red blood cells and destroy tissue by releasing cytolytic substances. Flagellate The flagellate is pear-shaped and biflagellate: this means that it has two flagella. This stage can be inhaled into the nasal cavity during swimming or diving. This biflagellate form occurs when trophozoites are exposed to a change in ionic concentration, such as placement in distilled water. The flagellate form does not exist in human tissue, but can exist in the cerebrospinal fluid. Once inside the nasal cavity, the flagellated form transforms into a trophozoite. The transformation of flagellate to trophozoite occurs within a few hours. Ecology Naegleria fowleri are excavates that inhabit soil and water. N. fowleri is sensitive to drying and acid. It cannot survive in sea water. This amoeba is able to grow best at moderately elevated temperatures making summer month cases more likely. N. fowleri is somewhat of a thermophile and is able to grow at temperatures up to . Warm, fresh water with a sufficient supply of bacterial food provides a habitat for amoebae. Man-made bodies of water, disturbed natural habitats, or areas with soil and unchlorinated/unfiltered water are locations where many amoebic infections have occurred. N. fowleri seems to thrive during periods of disturbance; the flagellate-empty hypothesis explains that Nagleria's success may be due to decreased competition from a depleted population of the normal, thermosensitive protozoal fauna. In other words, N. fowleri thrives in the absence of other predators consuming its food supply. This hypothesis suggests that human disturbances such as thermal pollution increase N. fowleri abundance by removing their resource competitors. Ameoboflagellates have a motile flagellate stage that is evolved for dispersal, which is advantageous when an environment has been cleared of competing organisms. Pathogenicity Roman Baths in Bath, Somerset, closed for bathing since 1978 due to presence of N. fowleri N. fowleri can cause an often fatal infection of the brain called naegleriasis (also known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, amoebic encephalitis/meningitis, or simply Naegleria infection). Infections most often occur when water containing N. fowleri is inhaled through the nose, where it then enters the nasal and olfactory nerve tissue, traveling to the brain through the cribriform plate. N. fowleri cannot cause infection by swallowing contaminated water. Infections typically occur after swimming in warm-climate freshwater, although there have been cases in cooler climates such as Minnesota. In rare cases, infection has been caused by nasal or sinus rinsing with contaminated water in a nasal rinsing device such as a neti pot. N. fowleri normally eat bacteria, but during human infections, the trophozoites consume astrocytes and neurons. The reason why N. fowleri prefers to pass across the cribriform plate has remained unknown, but the neurotransmitter acetylcholine has been suggested to act as a stimulus, as a structural homolog of animal CHRM1 has been shown to be present in Naegleria and Acanthamoeba. It takes one to nine days (average five) for symptoms to appear after nasal exposure to N. fowleri flagellates. Symptoms may include headache, fever, and nausea. Later symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention, loss of balance, seizures, and hallucinations. Once symptoms begin to appear, death will usually occur within two weeks. A person infected with N. fowleri cannot spread the infection to another person. From 2009 to 2018, 34 infections were reported in the US. Though rarely observed, infection by Naegleria fowleri can occur in animals. Experimentally, mice, guinea pigs, and sheep have been infected, and there have been reports of South American tapirs and cattle contracting naegleriasis. If many cases are unobserved or unreported, the rate of animal infection will be significantly higher than is documented.\\"Naegleria Fowleri in Animals\\". Louisiana Dept of Health & Hospitals, 25 September 2013. Treatment The core antimicrobial treatment consists of the antifungal drug amphotericin B, which inhibits the pathogen by binding to its cell membrane sterols, thus leading to cell membrane disruption and pathogen death;Asbill, Scott, and Kris Virga. \\"Naegleria Fowleri: Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options.\\" Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, American Society for Microbiology Journals, 1 Nov. 2015, aac.asm.org/content/59/11/6677. however, even with this treatment, the fatality rate is greater than 95%. New treatments are being sought. Miltefosine, an antiparasitic drug which inhibits the pathogen via disrupting its cell survival signal pathway PI3K/Akt/mTOR, has been used in a few cases with mixed results.

It is known for its recreational aviation facilities. Geography Cressbrook is a sparsely populated rural area with land used for crops and grazing; there is no urban centre. It is bounded by the Brisbane River to the north and east. Cressbrook Creek meanders from the west to the east of the locality where it enters the Brisbane River. The Cressbrook-Carboonbah Road traverses from the Brisbane Valley Highway in the north-west through the south-east of the locality towards Mount Beppo and beyond to Carboonbah. History The locality of Cressbrook takes its name from the Cressbrook Homestead established by David Cannon McConnel in 1841, who came from the village of Cressbrook in Derbyshire, England. In 1877, were resumed from the Cressbrook pastoral run and offered for selection on 17 April 1877. Cressbrook Provisional School was operating in 1881 but closed in 1882 due to low student numbers; its opening date is unknown. In 1898, the McConnel family established a condensed milk factory at Cressbrook; it was sold to Nestl√© in 1907. Victoria Chapel at the Cressbrook Homestead, 2010 On 1 June 1901, D. C. McConnel laid the first pile for the Victoria Chapel on the Cressbrook Homestead intended for the use of the McConnel family and their employees. It was a non-denominational chapel. Regular Anglican and Presbyterian services were held there and other denominations were served by visiting ministers. Cressbrook Lower State School opened on 11 April 1916. It closed in 1953. Fulham State School opened in 1920 and closed circa 1953. It was located at 372 Cressbrook Cabonah Road (southern corner with Fulham Road, , now in Cressbrook). Heritage listings Cressbrook has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * off Cressbrook-Caboombah Road: Cressbrook Homestead Watts Bridge Memorial Airfield The Watts Bridge Memorial Airfield is in the south-east of the locality and provides facilities for sports and recreational aviation. There are three grass runways of length , and . A number of aviation clubs operate from the airfield, flying vintage planes, gyroplanes, gliders, performing acrobatics and skydiving. Many recreational aviation events are held each year at the airfield. The airfield was established in 1942 as part of Australia's defences during World War II and known as the Toogoolawah airfield. After the war, the airfield was no longer needed for defence purposes, the buildings were removed and the land was used for grazing. In the early 1980s, the desire for recreational airfield facilities resulted in a group of recreational pilots re-establishing the runways and taxiways, and reopening the airfield in 1990 as the Watts Bridge Memorial Airfield. The name Watts Bridge is a reference to a nearby bridge that crossed the Brisbane River connecting Silverleigh Road in Cressbrook to Cooeeimbardi Road in Lower Cressbrook and was named after local dairyman James Robert Watts. Having survived many floods of the Brisbane River, the bridge was washed away in the 1974 Brisbane flood and not replaced.

Located on 88.9 MHz, XHM-FM is owned by Grupo ACIRhttps://grupoacir.com.mx/ and currently broadcasts news and talk programming, along with blocks of contemporary music in Spanish from the 1980s and 1990s, as \\"88.9 Noticias\\". History The concession for 88.9 FM in Mexico City was issued in October 1962, to Santiago Onta√±on N√∫√±ez, but it was not until the 1970s that the station began operations, known initially as \\"Un Oasis en FM\\" and later morphing into contemporary music-formatted \\"Sonido 89\\". The station's concession was given to Nu√±ez along with the concession for XHMM-FM, but the latter was later given to another concessionaire. The mid-1980s saw tumult for the station. Not long after becoming \\"Radio Metr√≥poli\\" and seeing its format move to 99.3 FM, the 1985 Mexico City earthquake severely damaged the station's studios and forced it off the air for a month. Sonido 89 would return in October 1985, but the decade of change continued; Ondas de Alegr√≠a, the group that owned XHM, was dissolved that same year, with ARTSA taking control of XHM and its sister stations. After a brief year as \\"F√≥rmula Mel√≥dica\\", XHM finally found a format that stuck, soft adult contemporary \\"Azul FM\\", in 1989, with both hits and lesser-known songs in English, French and Italian. The station's signature program in the Azul FM era was \\"Luna Azul\\", hosted by Jorge Lapuente. The station also featured programs dedicated to jazz, blues and Brazilian music. In 1995, XHM, XHPOP-FM and XHDFM-FM were sold to Grupo ACIR, which did not make drastic changes until November 3, 2003, when XHM changed to an all-news format as \\"88.9 Noticias, Informaci√≥n que Sirve\\". The newly relaunched XHM featured ACIR's Panorama Informativo newscast, sports programming, other talk programs focused on finances, health and lifestyle, as well as traffic and weather reports every 15 minutes. The \\"Azul\\" format was later revived as an Internet-only station, without hosts or commercials. \\"Siempre 88.9 - Traffic and Weather Every 15 Minutes\\" logo used from July 2013 to January 2018 On July 5, 2013, the all- news format ended in favor of a mix between news and talk and music in Spanish from past decades, which was officially launched on July 15 as \\"Siempre 88.9\\". Several of the hosts on 88.9 Noticias were moved to other ACIR radio stations in Mexico City, but the main newscast, the sports programs, a lifestyle nightly show and the traffic reports remained. Musical programming on weekdays was scaled down in mid-2015, only airing between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am, while still airing almost all day on weekends. In January 2018, ACIR restored the 88.9 Noticias brand to XHM, though it retains musical programming on weekends and overnights.

History Before Green County had a permanent courthouse, it conducted government business in the American House, a Monroe hotel which the county helped pay to build. In 1844, the county's first dedicated courthouse, a two-story Greek Revival structure, opened at the site of the present building; it served the county until it needed a larger space toward the end of the 19th century. After Monroe fought off a bid by nearby Monticello to claim the county seat, the present courthouse was built in 1891; it has functioned as the seat of county government ever since. . The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 21, 1978. Architecture Northwest corner of the courthouse, with the war memorial in front Architect G. Stanley Mansfield, a courthouse architect who also planned the Clinton County Courthouse in Iowa, designed the Richardsonian Romanesque courthouse. The two-and-one-half story building is built from red brick and limestone, the typical building materials of Romanesque architecture. A clock tower rises from the southwest corner of the building; smaller towers mark the other three corners. Limestone porches on the east and west sides cover the courthouse's two main entrances. Both the entranceways and the north and south sides' windows feature heavy limestone arches, a common Romanesque feature. The courthouse occupies a courthouse square which it shares with a Civil War memorial; the square is surrounded by Monroe's downtown commercial district. Artist Franz Rohrbeck painted two paintings displayed in one of the courthouse's court rooms. Rohrbeck, a German immigrant, painted murals in government buildings throughout the Midwest; one of his larger murals can be found in the Wisconsin State Capitol.

The period was a confused one during which political objectives were not always firmly fixed, nor clearly set out, but it is understood that Dorten's preference was for a Rhineland separated from \\"protestant\\" Prussia, and economically more closely aligned with France. At the end of 1923, a final attempt to establish an independent Rhenish state having failed, he escaped to Nice in France: here he resumed his legal career and worked on his memoirs. Life Early years Hans Adam Dorten was born in Endenich and attended primary and secondary schools in nearby Bonn. His father was the wealthy owner of a porcelian manufacturing company. On leaving school he went on to study Law at Heidelberg, Munich and Bonn, also receiving a Doctorate in Law in 1907 from Leipzig University. He had already, in August 1902, taken his \\"Civil Service Oath\\", and he also worked for a period at the District Prosecutor's Office in D√ºsseldorf. He then took a job at the district court in Waldbr√∂l where, in 1912, he was appointed a junior judge. The early progression of his legal career was also broken by a period of military service, undertaken with the Second Field Artillery Regiment No.23, based in Koblenz. Ellis Island records disclose that on 22 December 1912 Dorten disembarked from the (recently refurbished and renamed) trans-atlantic cruise liner \\"Victoria Luise\\" on a visit to the United States, accompanied by his wife.Ellis Island - FREE Port of New York Passenger Records Search: Ellis Island Ship Database (Einsicht der Originalkopie nur f√ºr registrierte Benutzer) He was recorded as a \\"non-immigrant\\", intending to visit Cleveland and San Francisco.Required by the Ellis Island immigration officers to supply the name of a friend or next of kin, Dorten wrote \\"friend: von Herling, Berlin, Salzburgerstr. 16\\" First World War Dorten was appointed State prosecutor in Berlin's District Court Number 3 with effect from 1 October 1914. Before he could take up his new appointment, however, war intervened: the opening of August 1914 found Germany scrambling to react to the Austrian declaration, on 28 July, of war against Serbia. Dorten's future career path was changed on 3 August 1914 when he was conscripted into the army. During the war he served in the 54th \\"Commando\\" Corps, ending up as a junior officer (Hauptmann). He was honoured with the Iron Cross Medal, Class I and then Class II. In 1918, he was put under military arrest for \\"violent criticism\\" of the Kaiser. The end of the war allowed him to avoid a court martial On 2 December 1918 he was released from the army, and until July 1919 he spent his accumulated months of leave entitlement. A switch to politics in the aftermath of war Early in 1919 the Dortens relocated to Wiesbaden. With the abdication of the Kaiser, Hans Adam turned his attention to politics during the socially and politically turbulent months that ensued. His agenda was anti-Socialist and pro-Rhineland. He financed his activities with his accumulated personal assets. He had married a very rich wife. Dorten's political purposes were not always clear-cut to contemporaries, but in retrospect many historians believe that his defining political objective was a Rhenish Republic, to operate at least initially as a part of the emerging German state. Despite extensive contacts with local political committees and with leading Rhineland politicians from the political centre such as Konrad Adenauer, Dorten was unable to gain a position of leadership in the separatist movement, however. That was partly because of his own uncompromising rejection of any sort of accommodation with the (moderately left-wing residual majority) Social Democratic Party, and partly because he was calling for an economic rapprochement with France. Dorten continued to convene meetings of properly authorized officials and representatives in the Rhineland to try and obtain legitimacy and agreement from the towns and rural districts for the support of his objectives. His efforts met with some limited success in the southern part of the Rhineland. Not withstanding several setbacks, Dorten was able to find politically likeminded allies, including Dr. Franz Geueke, the publisher of the Rheinische Volkszeitung, the regional newspaper. It subsequently transpired that he also on various occasions during 1919, held talks at his home at Hilda Street 14 in Wiesbaden with officers from the French army of occupation, including General Mangin himself. The French made no secret of their enthusiasm the idea of peeling the Rhineland off from the rest of Germany, and they encouraged Dorten to create an independent Rhenish Republic, which from their point of view could become part of a larger solution to the \\"German problem\\". But rumours that Dorten might be \\"negotiating\\" with the French occupiers were costly in terms of support among the Rhinelanders. French military occupation and the massive economic burden blamed on reparations being paid to the French were causing real economic hardship, and a campaign of passive resistance ensued. Dorten openly opposed the passive resistance which he said was self-defeating, wrecking the economy and further impoverishing Rhinelanders. His pragmatic judgements regarding the economic interests of his region completely failed to capture the popular mood, however. Dorten's regional nationalist objectives, as far as the matter can be judged from available sources, involved separating the Rhineland from the \\"Prussian state\\" which was widely blamed for the disaster of the war, but his goals always stopped short of complete independence for the Rhineland from the rest of the German state, for which he envisaged a more federal structure than was, at that time, on offer. Proclamation of the Rhenish Republic in Wiesbaden The Rhenish Republic was proclaimed in Wiesbaden on 1 June 1919, with Hans Adam Dorten as its \\"president\\". After a week, it was impossible to deny that the \\"Putsch\\" had failed, in the face of large-scale popular protests, and opposition from all the municipal councils and other relevant organisations in the region. Dorten had expected backing from the French occupation forces, but they took a position of strict neutrality. The founders of the Rhenish Republic were unable to pursue their project in the face of combined opposition from the people and the municipalities. A warrant was issued by the Leipzig based Supreme Court for Dorten's arrest, on a charge of treason; but the warrant could not be executed in the Rhineland due to the occupation. Separatist agitation after the failed \\"Putsch\\" Dorten did not give up. 26 August 1923 found him in M√∂nchengladbach, attempting to address a rally. The separatists were attacked by \\"nationalists loyal to the Berlin government\\", and Dorten had to pretend to be an American journalist in order to escape the mob. There was another attempt to establish a Rhenish Republic in October 1923, and Dorten again played a leading role. Together with Josef Matthes he set up a \\"provisional government of the Rhenish Republic\\" in Koblenz. Following differences, the next month he proclaimed a government for the southern part of the Rhineland in Bad Ems. This insurrection also failed because widespread popular opposition, and because of a falling off in support from the French military authorities. French exile Following his latest failure to establish a Rhenish Republic, on the night of 31 December 1923/1 January 1924 Hans Adam Dorten made his way to France, settling at Nice in the south-east of the country. In 1927 he resumed work as a lawyer, and in 1928 he took French citizenship. His memoires were finished in 1937 under the title \\"La Trag√©die Rh√©nane\\". The volume was published only in 1945, to be followed by a German language translation in 1979.

The product is available as either free software, commercial software with guaranteed support services, or as a hardware appliance (including support services).  Short Description  The Endian Firewall is a turnkey Linux security distribution, which is an independent, unified security management operating system. The Endian Firewall is based on a hardened Linux operating system. The system is installed on a PC using a boot CD and can be operated without a monitor through its online interface or via a keyboard in a command-line interface. The server can be configured via a web interface or the serial interface. The main task of Endian Firewall is as a gateway, router and firewall, and can act as a proxy for web, email, FTP, SIP and DNS. Up to four different networks (dependent on the number of network cards installed in the host PC) are normally managed. Networks are configured through the web interface. With Endian these are differentiated by their color coding: * Red Network: connection to the insecure Internet. * Green Network: Secure intranet e.g. file server. * Orange Network: Part Safe Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) . This includes devices that operate their own server and must be accessible over the Internet, such as Web or FTP servers. * Blue Network: Secure wireless part, here on wireless devices can be connected. Thus, they are separated from the green network, which increases its security. The Endian Firewall includes support for load balancing, which means you can add another connection to the Internet from the red network; Endian Firewall then distributes the network load on both interfaces.  License  Behind the Endian Firewall is the Italian Endian Spa from Appiano, South Tyrol and a community of volunteer developers and helpers. The license model of Endian provides a commercial version and a free version: * The commercial version can be purchased either as a standalone software (the product is called Endian or simply Endian UTM Software) in order to install them on their own PCs, as well as in the form of finished Out of the Box - firewalls, with special hardware on which the software is preinstalled. There are currently seven hardware variants with different performance and for different network sizes: Mini 25, Mercury 50, Mercury 100, Macro 250, Macro 500, Macro 1000 and Macro 2500. * Both the free Endian Firewall Community and the commercial Endian UTM Software are tailored for installation on your own hardware. The Endian Firewall Community is licensed under the GPL and is therefore open source software that can be downloaded for free. The community version does not include support and not all the features of the commercial version are available.  Features  The current version includes the following key features:  Gateway  * Ethernet support * Traffic Shaping / Quality of Service * Multiple uplinks * Uplink Failover  Firewall & Security  * Firewall (both directions) * Demilitarized Zone * Intrusion Detection System / Intrusion Prevention System * Web-, FTP- and E-Mail-antivirus * Antispam * Content Filter * HTTPS- Web interface * SSH- Access and Forwarding * Scheduler for automated backups  Server Services  * Transparent HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP and POP3-Proxy server * Caching DNS-Server * DHCP-server (separately for the green, blue and orange network) * Network Address Translation * Virtual Private Network (VPN) Gateway with OpenVPN or IPsec * NTP-Server * Policy-Based Routing (port, MAC address, protocol or port) * Generic SNMP support * VLAN support (IEEE 802.1Q trunking)  User Management  * Local * RADIUS * LDAP * Active Directory * NTLM Single Sign-On * User or group as HTTP proxy content filter rules  Logging & Monitoring  * Visualized Live Log Viewer (AJAX based), see figure \\"The web interface of Endian Firewall\\" * Log the activities and the stress of network and hardware * Connection statistics * Forwarding possibility of logs to an external syslog server * ntopng integration * Event-based notifications by e-mail  Others  * Support Software-RAID  History and compared to the original  Endian Firewall is a fork of the Linux firewall IPCop, which in turn is a fork of SmoothWall. Due to numerous further developments, only one-fifth of the original IPCop code is used. Newer versions have been based initially on Linux From Scratch and from version 2.2 to RHEL, or on CentOS. With the upcoming version 3.0, Endian Firewall is virtually \\"Smoothwall-\\" and \\"IPCop-free\\". The greatest difference from IPCop is that the Endian Firewall is not merely a pure router-firewall combination, but a comprehensive gateway security solution (Unified Threat Management). For this, a virus scanner and a spam blocker have been firmly integrated into the distribution. This allows the transport of HTTP, FTP, POP 3 and SMTP scanned in real-time and optionally filtered. Also, the menus were refined from the IPCop approach, reducing complexity, but also reducing reconfigurability of the individual services. Concerning the business model, Endian is different to its origins in SmoothWall and IPCop as follows: * SmoothWall: a commercial version is developed by SmoothWall Ltd and a free version by a community of volunteers. Innovations in the commercial version are only partially transferred, and security updates are sometimes deliberately delayed in the free version. This policy was the reason for the forking of Smoothwall and community development of IPCop * IPCop: development exclusively by a community of volunteers with only a free version. * Endian Firewall: Friendly refinement of IPCop with the aim to expand the software functions to create a comprehensive security gateway software. As with SmoothWall, Endian Firewall also includes features in the commercial version functions that are missing from the free community version.  Resonance  * The Endian Firewall is part of c't-Debian-Server Version 4 (published by August 2009) and this was already 2007. * In July 2005, the Endian firewall was OSDir elected Project of the Week. * The Linux Magazine 09/2008 has Endian Firewall UTM Appliances 2.2 and tested the system to certify a test result in the upper middle of comparable products.

In 1843, at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, he played many leading parts in comedy. He was for some years in London at the Lyceum or at Drury Lane, and was during eleven years stage manager at Drury Lane. He acted much with Charles Mathews, and was with him and Madame Vestris at the Lyceum from 1847 to 1855. This was the best part of his career. In October 1855 he played, at Drury Lane, Rob Royland to the Mopus of Charles Mathews, in Married for Money, an adaptation of John Poole's The Wealthy Widow.

There were reports that in May 2009, the Lagos State government awarded contracts to help stop flooding, which is a major problem in that area.

Her efforts are recognised towards the establishment of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, an autonomous body under the MHRD, attending to the educational needs of the children of transferable central government employees. The Government of India awarded her the fourth highest Indian civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 1983. Biography Ahalya Chari was born in 1921 in Rangoon, the capital of British Burma, to Rajalakshmi Chari and Kasturi Rajagopal Chari as the eldest of their seven children. She did her schooling at a girl's convent school run under the British curriculum and graduated from the University of Rangoon in English Literature in 1941. The Second World War forced her family to leave Burma and the family fled to Benares, stopping over at a refugee camp at Shwebo and Calcutta on the way. Settling in Benares, she did her master's degree at Benaras Hindu University and started her career in 1943 as a lecturer at the Vasanta College for Women, where she worked for 10 years. In 1951, Chari resigned from the Vasanta College and moved to Delhi to join the Department of Education - University of Delhi, formerly known as the Central Institute of Education (CIE), as a student for advanced training in education. At this time, she received a Fulbright Scholarship for further studies in the United States where she spent two years and returned to CIE in 1953 as a member of the faculty. When the government decided to set up an apex institution for education with assistance from USAID by hiring consultants from Columbia University, Chari was delegated to the project and was involved with the establishment of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in 1961. After the establishment of the institution, she trained for one year in Applied Linguistics (1961‚Äì62) at the University of Edinburgh. On her return to India in 1962, she was appointed as the head of the textbooks department at NCERT, a job she held till 1969. During her time at NCERT, she launched a 'Reading Project' and prepared read-ready materials for inculcating reading habits in children and was instrumental in redesigning the school syllabi. When NCERT started four regional centres of education at Ajmer, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar and Mysore, she was appointed as the principal of the Regional Institute of Education in Mysore. In the early 1960s, the Ministry of Human Resource Development established the Central School system and placed the chain of schools under the administration of a central office, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), with Chari as the first commissioner of the central administrative office. She worked with KVS till 1976 when she came under the influence of Jiddu Krishnamurti and joined the Indian philosopher to work at the Rajghat Education Centre in Varanasi. Her next move was to Madras (now Chennai) in 1982 as the principal of The School, one of the schools of the Krishnamurti Foundation of India (KFI). At The School, KFI, she worked against commercialisation of education and initiated projects such as implementation of the government's Right to Education Act, introduction of integrated educational programmes and initiation of the open school system. Later years Chari continued her association with the KFI institutions and established an Alumni Forum of The School for exchange of information. She stayed in Vasant Vihar in Chennai, where the headquarters of the Krishnamurti Foundation of India is located, and served as a trustee of the foundation. She started the Journal of the Krishnamurti Schools and edited them for a number of years. She also published two books, Thinking Together, published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training in 1997 (in Hindi and English), and Selections from the Decades: On Self-Knowledge, published by KFI in 2001. She also delivered lectures including one on 'Knowledge and the Disciplines'. The Government of India awarded her the civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1983.

She wanted her new congregation to focus on the care of all women. During her life and after her death, she was referred to as an \\"Angel of Solitude\\".Genoveva Torres Morales (1870-1956) Pope John Paul II beatified her in 1995 and canonized her on in 2003 in Spain. Life Genoveva Torres Morales was born in Almenara in 1870 as the last of six children to poor parents whom she lost in her childhood before she was eight. Four of her six brothers also died at this point. She remained in the care of her eldest brother Jos√© who was 18. Despite this hard life she remained steadfast in her faith which never wavered. Of course this also impacted on her completion of her education due to the circumstances. Despite the fact that he treated her with much respect Jos√© was taciturn and demanding of her. Deprived of affection and companionship Morales grew quite accustomed to solitude. At the age of ten she took a keen interest in spiritual publications and came to understand that God had willed her to follow him into his service. She also realized that true happiness is his will and decided to dedicate her whole life to that fact. In 1882 a tumor in her knee appeared and this led to the amputation of her leg. Due to the crude method of amputation she was forced to walk with crutches following this. In 1884 she grew ill and in 1885 was able to admit herself into a hospice to recover which the Carmelites oversaw. She remained there for almost a decade while she deepened her spiritual life and cultivated her blossoming vocation. She also met the priest Carlos Ferr√≠s who would help her deepen her spiritual life. Despite the fact that she wished to join the congregation she left the hospice in 1895 and retired back to her hometown with the idea of establishing a congregation with a special emphasis for the women. To that end she consulted with spiritual directors as well as the Jesuits - in particular Mart√≠n S√°nchez - and began to plan how she would go about this mission of hers. Her first aim was to establish special houses for women that were in need of assistance and the first house was opened in 1911 in Valencia. Others in places such as Barcelona and Santander soon opened. The General House was then established along with a novitiate and led to the formation of her own congregation. Her ailments worsened in the 1950s which added to her deafness. She resigned her post as Mother General in 1954. Her congregation received the papal approval of Pope Pius XII in 1953. Morales died at the beginning of 1956 in Zaragoza. She was granted the nickname of \\"Angel of Solitude\\" due to her peaceful and humorous disposition with a deep faith in Jesus Christ. Canonization Tomb of St. Genoveva Torres Morales. The canonization cause commenced in Zaragoza on 12 July 1975 under Pope Paul VI which conferred upon her the posthumous title of Servant of God. The process started with the accumulation of documentation and testimonies in a process that spanned from 5 January 1976 until 3 April 1978. The process was formally ratified on 11 November 1983, resulting in the Positio being submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 1987. Pope John Paul II approved that she had lived a life of heroic virtue and declared her to be Venerable on 22 January 1991. The miracle attributed to her intercession required for her beatification was investigated and ratified on 17 January 1992. John Paul II approved the miracle on 2 July 1994 and beatified her on 29 January 1995. The second miracle needed for canonization was ratified on 19 November 1999 and received papal approval, leading to John Paul II canonizing her on his visit to Spain on 4 May 2003.

After her husband's knighthood in 1902 she was known as Lady Barton. Early life Barton was born in London, England, one of three children born to Euphemia (n√©e Home) and David Ross. The family immigrated to Newcastle, New South Wales, when she was a small child. Her father was Scottish and a trained engineer. After losing money in mining investments, he became the licensee of the Albion Inn, a pub on Hunter Street. He was popular in the community and served as an alderman. His wife died soon after the family arrived in Australia, and the children were largely raised by their aunt Ellen Home, who lived with them. Marriage and children Jeanie Ross met her future husband Edmund Barton in April 1870, when he visited Newcastle with the Sydney University Cricket Club. They were introduced by his friend Richard Teece. After he returned to Sydney, he sent her a copy of Tennyson's poem The Princess. She visited him the following month and was introduced to his parents, with an engagement following. However, for primarily financial reasons the couple did not marry for another five years. They eventually wed at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Newcastle, on 28 December 1877. She converted from Presbyterianism to Anglicanism for her husband, although she was more religious than him. Once married, the Bartons briefly lived in Stanmore, but after a few months moved to a large house in Redfern so they could be joined by William Barton, Edmund's elderly father (d. 1881). For various reasons, they moved house approximately every two years until 1896 when they rented Miandatta in Carabella Street, North Sydney. This would remain their home for twelve years.

She shared her husband's enthusiasm for the federation movement, and served as a vice-president of the Sydney Women's Federal League. She was reportedly reluctant to speak in public. She was the hostess of her husband's open-house meetings on the subject of federation, whose attendees included prominent federationists like Robert Garran, Atlee Hunt and Thomas Bavin. During Edmund Barton's term as prime minister, his wife and children continued to live in Sydney. There was no official prime minister's residence in the temporary capital, and \\"the prime minister's salary of ¬£2,500 [...] was not enough to allow for Jeanie and their younger children to live with him while in Melbourne\\". She did accompany her husband to the 1902 Colonial Conference in London, and attended the coronation of King Edward VII; she was tasked with presenting Queen Alexandra with a possum-fur carriage rug as a gift of New South Wales. The Bartons took on daily social engagements during their visit, and were well received. According to Geoffrey Bolton, \\"the daughter of a Newcastle publican and the son of an unsuccessful Sydney stockbroker found themselves moving easily in a closed society intolerant of the parvenu or the ill behaved\\". Final years Barton in 1930, aged 78 or 79 In 1912, Barton was a founding member of the Queens Club in Sydney, and was chosen as the inaugural club president. She was widowed in 1920, and from 1922 to 1927 lived in England with her son Wilfrid and his family. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, \\"one of her last appearances in public life\\" was at a 1935 service in Centennial Park marking the silver jubilee of King George V.

In approximately in half of these cases, the underlying cause is related to the male. The underlying causative factors in the male infertility can be attributed to environmental toxins, systemic disorders such as, hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary disease, testicular cancers and germ-cell aplasia. Genetic factors including aneuploidies and single-gene mutations are also contributed to the male infertility. Patients suffering from nonobstructive azoospermia or oligozoospermia show microdeletions in the long arm of the Y chromosome and/or chromosomal abnormalities, each with the respective frequency of 9.7% and 13%. A large percentage of human male infertility is estimated to be caused by mutations in genes involved in primary or secondary spermatogenesis and sperm quality and function. Single-gene defects are the focus of most research carried out in this field. NR5A1 mutations are associated with male infertility, suggesting the possibility that these mutations cause the infertility. However, it is possible that these mutations individually have no major effect and only contribute to the male infertility by collaboration with other contributors such as environmental factors and other genomics variants. Vice versa, existence of the other alleles could reduce the phenotypic effects of impaired NR5A1 proteins and attenuate the expression of abnormal phenotypes and manifest male infertility solely. NR5A1 roles in sex development and related disorders Nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 1 (NR5A1), also known as SF1 or Ad4BP (MIM 184757), is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q33.3). The NR5A1 is an orphan nuclear receptor that was first identified following the search for a common regulator of the cytochrome P450 steroid hydroxylase enzyme family. This receptor is a pivotal transcriptional regulator of an array of genes involved in reproduction, steroidogenesis and male sexual differentiation and also plays a crucial role in adrenal gland formation in both sexes. NR5A1 regulates the mullerian inhibitory substance by binding to a conserved upstream regulatory element and directly participates in the process of mammalian sex determination through mullerian duct regression. Targeted disruption of NR5A1 (Ftzf1) in mice results in gonadal and adrenal agenesis, persistence of Mullerian structures and abnormalities of the hypothalamus and pituitary gonadotropes. Heterozygous animals demonstrate a milder phenotype including an impaired adrenal stress response and reduced testicular size. In humans, NR5A1 mutations were first described in patients with 46, XY karyotype and disorders of sex development (DSD), Mullerian structures and primary adrenal failure (MIM 612965). After that, heterozygous NR5A1 mutations were described in seven patients showing 46, XY karyotype and ambiguous genitalia, gonadal dysgenesis, but no adrenal insufficiency. Since then, studies have confirmed that mutations in NR5A1 in patients with 46, XY karyotype cause severe underandrogenisation, but no adrenal insufficiency, establishing dynamic and dosage-dependent actions for NR5A1. Subsequent studies revealed that NR5A1 heterozygous mutations cause primary ovarian insufficiency (MIM 612964). NR5A1 new roles in fertility and infertility Recently, NR5A1 mutations have been related to human male infertility (MIM 613957). These findings substantially increase the number of NR5A1 mutations reported in humans and show that mutations in NR5A1 can be found in patients with a wide range of phenotypic features, ranging from 46,XY sex reversal with primary adrenal failure to male infertility. For the first time, Bashamboo et al. (2010) conducted a study on the nonobstructive infertile men (a non-Caucasian mixed ancestry n = 315), which resulted in the report of all missense mutations in the NR5A1 gene with 4% frequency. Functional studies of the missense mutations revealed impaired transcriptional activation of NR5A1-responsive target genes. Subsequently, three missense mutations were identified as associated with and most likely the cause of the male infertility, according to computational analyses. The study indicated that the mutation frequency is below 1% (Caucasian German origin, n = 488). In another study the coding sequence of NR5A1 has been analysed in a cohort of 90 well-characterised idiopathic Iranian azoospermic infertile men versus 112 fertile men. Heterozygous NR5A1 mutations were found in 2 of 90 (2.2%) of cases. These two patients harboured missense mutations within the hinge region (p.P97T) and ligand-binding domain (p.E237K) of the NR5A1 protein.

Historically, section 117 had been read down by the High Court so as to be devoid of any real meaning. For example, in 1904 it was found that discrimination in favour of people who are \\"residents of and domiciled in Western Australia\\" was permissible, as the Constitution only prohibited discrimination on the basis of a person's State of residence, not their State of domicile. In the 1989 landmark case Street v Queensland Bar Association, the modern approach to interpretation was developed. The court held that the purpose of the section was national unity, and consequentially, residence should be given a broader meaning. In addition, the court overruled a case in which the historical approach was used. In reaching its conclusion, each of the seven Justices issued a separate opinion. Combining this with the fact that there is little case law referencing section 117, there remains significant debate over the nature and extent of the right contained within it. Origins Richard O'Connor, who proposed the wording acceptable to the Convention Section 117 was inspired by both the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution. The original form of the section, proposed at the 1891 Constitutional Convention, read: At the Melbourne session of the 1897‚Äì1898 Constitutional Convention, it was decided that the first part of the section should be removed because it was unclear to the delegates how one State's law could interfere with the privilege or immunity of a citizen of another State, and in addition there was no definition of a Commonwealth citizen. Several attempts were made to define Commonwealth citizenship, none of which were successful. Richard O'Connor eventually proposed that the clause read: But this too was rejected on the grounds that it would be impossible for there to be any practical difference between the rights of citizens by State. Following this, O'Connor made another proposal, which was accepted. After a minor modification, section 117 reached the form that it is in today: Interpretation \\"Subject of the Queen\\" \\"Subject of the Queen\\" has not been definitively defined by the High Court, but for practical purposes, all Australian Citizens are subjects of the Queen. \\"The Queen\\" refers to the office of the Queen in right of Australia.The Laws of Australia - Encyclopedia [19.6.850] In Street, several of the Justices suggested that, in modern times, \\"subject of the Queen\\" was synonymous with \\"Australian citizen\\", but ultimately, it was not necessary to decide the question. Similarly, in Singh v Commonwealth of Australia, it was suggested that \\"subject of the Queen\\" may have the same meaning as \\"non-alien\\", within the meaning of section 51(xix) of the Constitution, but this too was not stated definitively. Corporations are not subjects of the Queen. \\"Resident in any State\\" The usage of the word \\"State\\" excludes residents of Territories from the protection of section 117.The Laws of Australia - Encyclopedia [19.6.830] Residency, on the other hand, is defined broadly, and applies regardless of whether the residency is permanent or temporary.The Laws of Australia - Encyclopedia [19.6.840] \\"Disability or discrimination\\" The practical effect of a law on out-of- State residents is what is to be considered, even if the law nominally applies to all subjects of the Queen, regardless of their State of residence. In determining whether discrimination has occurred, the relative positions of the person claiming discrimination and a hypothetical person who has the same characteristics, except for State of residency, are to be compared. As an example, a State Bar Association may not, as a condition of admission, require an undertaking to become a resident of said State. Even though the requirement applies equally to residents of each State, it has a much more onerous impact on those out-of-State than those in-State. =Exceptions to the rule= Not all forms of discrimination on the basis of State are inconsistent with section 117. Welfare schemes, as well as voting rights and regulation of conduct that threatens State security are not seen to be inconsistent with the section.The Laws of Australia - Encyclopedia [19.6.890] There is no agreement upon a test which can be applied to determine whether any particular disability or discrimination is covered by the exception. However, in the 2006 case Sweedman v Transport Accident Commission, it was hinted ‚Äì but not determined ‚Äì that when a regulation is \\"appropriate and adapted... to the attainment of a proper objective\\",. it will be permissible. =Commonwealth laws= It is unclear to what extent, if any, the right conveyed by the section extends to actions and laws of the Commonwealth that give different treatment to residents of different States. In Leeth v Commonwealth, John Toohey and William Deane attempted to find an implied right to equality under Commonwealth law, but Anthony Mason, Daryl Dawson and Michael McHugh found that \\"no general requirement contained in the Constitution that Commonwealth laws should have a uniform operation throughout the Commonwealth\\".The Laws of Australia - Encyclopedia [19.6.900] The issue remains undetermined, but ANU Senior Lecturer Amelia Simpson has expressed the opinion that \\"the chances of survival, or revival, of the rights-inspired reading of s 117 appear slim\\", while Jeremy Kirk has acknowledged the opposition of many of the Justices to the adoption of such a view.

They used it as a stronghold and to collect taxes from nearby farms. The castle was damaged at some point, and repairs began in 1383, when it became the property of the Lords of Villanders. The castle changed hands many times, belonging to the Sparrenberger family in the 15th century, and the Lords Lanser di Appiano between 1654 and 1818.

The team is controlled by the Polski ZwiƒÖzek Pi≈Çki Siatkowej (PZPS), which represents the country in international competitions - CEV U21 European Championships and FIVB U21 World Championships. Polish national under-21 team is ranked 9th (as of September 2015) in the FIVB world ranking. Poland national under-21 team is the current European and World Champion. History First massive success Polish junior national team was achieved by players born mostly in 1977 and 1978. The junior national team led by coach Ireneusz Mazur achieved titles of 1996 Junior European Champion and 1997 Junior World Champion successively in the tournaments held in Israel and Bahrain. Among the players of this team were several players who later achieved notable careers and many medals in domestic and international tournaments like for example Pawe≈Ç Zagumny, Krzysztof Ignaczak, Sebastian ≈öwiderski, Piotr Gruszka. In 2003 Polish junior national team was crowned as the 2003 Junior World Champion. The national team born in 1983-85, led by Grzegorz Ry≈õ, beat Brazil in the finale after tie break. It was a second title of Junior World Champions for Poland. Among the players was a few later senior European and (or) World Champions like Micha≈Ç Winiarski, Mariusz Wlaz≈Çy, Marcin Mo≈ºd≈ºonek, Micha≈Ç Ruciak, Pawe≈Ç Woicki, Marcel Gromadowski. On September 10, 2016 Poland U21 achieved title of the 2016 CEV U20 European Champion after winning 7 of 7 matches in tournament and beating Ukraine U21 in the finale (3‚Äì1). On July 2, 2017 Poland U21 achieved title of U21 World Champion 2017 after beating Cuba U21 in the finale (3‚Äì0). The same squad of national team, led by coach Sebastian Pawlik, won 48 matches in the row and never lost (counted also under-19 tournaments). The squad roster, consisting mainly of players from the year 1997, has won all possible European and World championships under-19 and under-21.

It was designed by Queensland Railways and built in 1910 by Queensland Railways. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 November 2008. It was destroyed in 2013 as a consequence of flooding associated with Cyclone Oswald.  History  The Harlin Rail Bridge, which crossed Ivory Creek (previously Maronghi Creek) at Harlin was located from Wulkuraka railway station. It was a half-through Pratt truss (or pony truss) bridge built between 1909 and 1910 and was the only surviving concrete and steel railway bridge on the Brisbane Valley railway line. This line was developed as a branch line from the main Brisbane-Toowoomba rail line. It was constructed from Wulkuraka near Ipswich to Lowood (1884), then extended to Esk (1886), then Toogoolawah (February 1904), Yimbun (September 1904), Linville (1910), Benarkin and Blackbutt (1911) and finally to Yarraman (1913). Originally intended that the line would eventually meet the Gympie to Nanango rail line to serve as a rail connection to Gympie and be a shorter route between the South Burnett and Brisbane, the final linking section was never constructed. The Upper Brisbane Valley was settled by squatters in the 1840s and the timber industry in the Brisbane Valley also dates from this period. Closer settlement began in the 1870s. The timber industry quickly developed thereafter as land was rapidly cleared by selectors and the increased population of Brisbane and Ipswich from the 1870s demanded timber for housing and fuel on a continuing basis. The first sawmills in the Brisbane Valley, established in the 1870s, were located at Rosewood, Dundas and Colinton. Closer settlement of the Brisbane Valley had progressed sufficiently by 1877 for the country from Walloon via Esk and Nanango to be examined as a possible route for a railway to Gympie. In 1879 Queensland Premier Thomas McIlwraith approved the building of several branch lines, including one to Esk. However, the original plans for these branch lines were withdrawn from parliamentary consideration in 1880 on the recommendation of Francis Thomas Gregory, Member of the Queensland Legislative Council. In spite of this opposition, in 1881 the Queensland Parliament approved the building of the Brisbane Valley branch line from Wulkuraka to Esk. The contract for the first section was let to O'Rourke and McSharry in October 1882 with Henry Charles Stanley acting as Chief Engineer. This section to Lowood, a place that scarcely existed before the railway, opened on 16 June 1884. The Brisbane Valley Branch Line was the second branch line in Queensland after the Dugandan railway line, which opened to Harrisville in 1882. Within weeks an extension of the line from Lowood to Esk was approved in August 1884 by Premier Samuel Griffith. Henry Charles Stanley remained as Chief Engineer but HA Brigg was appointed as the contractor. The second section to Esk opened on 9 August 1886 and remained the terminus for more than 17 years, becoming an important centre and livestock loading point. During the 1880s closer settlement of the Brisbane Valley intensified. Land from Cressbrook Station was resumed and settled. In 1889 James McConnel began selling off small parcels of land from his property Cressbrook to his workers for dairying. The railway, which provided rapid and cheap transport to Brisbane, fostered the timber industry's development. Over the next 30 years sawmills were established at Lowood, Esk, Toogoolawah, Moore, Linville, Harlin, Blackbutt, Monsildale and Perseverance as well as a number of portable sawmills operating in stands of timber. In the late 19th century four dairy factories operated in the Brisbane Valley and utilised the railway for transporting milk and its products. Lowood dairy factory opened in 1890. Toogoolawah dairy factory (managed by Cressbrook Dairy Company) and Colinton Dairy Factory (managed by Standard Dairy Co Ltd) opened in 1898, while the Esk dairy factory opened in 1904. Circa 1898 Cressbrook Condensed Milk Factory, owned by James McConnel and owner/manager Colin Munro, opened on the banks of Cressbrook Creek. The factory and seven dairy farms that supplied it were purchased by Nestl√© in 1907 and remained in operation until 1930 with local dairy farmers supplying its milk. In 1900 a parliamentary inquiry was conducted to determine the best route for a proposed rail line to Nanango. James McConnel of Cressbrook stated that an extension of the Brisbane Valley Railway Line would enable selectors to pursue dairying rather than grazing and to cultivate the land. The inquiry subsequently recommended a extension of the Brisbane Valley Branch Line to Moore, which was approved in December of the same year. The first section, to the new township of Toogoolawah, which was the site of the Cressbrook Condensed Milk Factory, opened on 8 February 1904. On 1 September 1904 the extension to Yimbun was opened and remained the terminus until 1910. To access the vast timber resources beyond Yimbun a further extension of the line to Blackbutt was considered. The Blackbutt Tableland was notable as a rich farming district, that the railway was expected to expand. On the ranges hoop and bunya pines were already being exploited, and with conservation it was expected that freight for the railway would be supplied for many years. At Moore there were two sawmills operating and there were two more in the Blackbutt area. Plans for the of rail line from Yimbun to Blackbutt were approved at a Committee meeting on S.S. Lucinda on 9 January 1907. They were introduced into Parliament on 13 March 1908 and passed on 1 April 1908. The Commissioner of Railways' report on the Blackbutt extension noted that substantial bridges would be needed at five sites including over Maronghi Creek and all were to be built with timber. However, the bridges over both Maronghi and Emu Creeks were built of steel and concrete. In 1908 drawings of a standard span were drawn up for the Harlin Rail Bridge. In the following year materials for the building of railway bridges over Maronghi Creek and Emu Creek and the Yimbun tunnel were purchased. The tender for cast iron cylinders for the steel bridges over Maronghi and Emu Creeks was won by Bundaberg Foundry with a quote of in 1909. They also won the tender for the same supplies for a bridge over Neerkol Creek (Central Western railway line). Walkers, Maryborough were contracted to supply other materials for these bridges. The type of bridge constructed over Maronghi Creek at Harlin was a half-through Pratt truss structure. This bridge type differed subtly from the more widely used through Pratt truss bridge in that its girders were not high enough to allow cross bracing at the top between the trusses on each side of the bridge. Half-through Pratt truss bridges were designed to carry a lesser load than through Pratt truss bridges. The Harlin Rail Bridge was built by the Resident Engineer Hugh Fraser using day labour from a team of 250 men stationed at Harlin. The practice of using day labour instead of contractors began in 1901 and continued for the next quarter of a century. In 1909 there were temporary timber girders for the approach spans as the Engineer waited for supplies from Walkers. By 20 January 1910 Walkers' supply of material for the bridges over Maronghi and Emu Creeks was 13¬Ω weeks overdue. As an alternative, two open girder spans intended for Neerkol Creek Bridge were diverted to Maronghi Creek Bridge. In May 1910 a construction train crossed this bridge for the first time on its way to Harlin railway station. The extension to Blackbutt was completed during 1911. This section of the Brisbane Valley Rail Line was built under the 1895 Railways Guarantee Act which provided for local authorities to request construction of a railway by guaranteeing to meet any losses and the interest on capital borrowed for construction. The Railways Department was also required to share any deficit equally with the guarantors. The guarantee ended after 14 years unless a profit was made for three consecutive years, at which time it ceased. The cost to the residents in the benefited area served by the rail line including the Harlin Bridge in the financial year 1913-1914 was . Of this amount the Esk Shire Council paid , Crow's Nest Shire Council , Nanango Shire Council and Treasury . The nett revenue of the Brisbane Valley Branch Line was positive until the 1917-18 financial year after which the line experienced a period of losses until 1932 following which it again returned substantial nett revenues. The next section of the Brisbane Valley Rail Line, to Yarraman, was approved by parliament in December 1910 and opened on 1 May 1913. The last section required to complete the loop to Gympie was approved by parliament on 30 October 1918 but was never built. Passenger services were a feature of the Brisbane Valley Line from the commencement of the service. From 1913 a passenger service ran from Yarraman to Ipswich three days a week, taking six hours. In 1928 rail motor services commenced on the Brisbane Valley railway line and when new rail motors were introduced the Brisbane Valley line, together with the Dugandan line, was the first to use them. Although limited to and averaging no more than they were faster, more comfortable and reliable than road transport or mixed trains. By 1920 much of the forest timber had been cut out of the Brisbane Valley and the major industry was dairying. Accordingly, in the 1920s, the railway was transporting cream to the butter factories along the Brisbane Valley line - Colinton until 1921, Toogoolawah, Esk and Lowood. Whole milk was transported to the Nestle and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Factory at Toogoolawah until its closure in 1930. However, on the Blackbutt Range timber was still being cut and transported via rail. In 1934 The Courier-Mail reported increased timber haulage from railway loading centres between Benarkin and Yarraman. The amount was more than 1,500,000 super feet per month over the prior 12 months and formed the biggest proportion of freight on the Brisbane Valley railway line. All the timber was being cut from Crown reserves as privately held land was practically cut out. Most of the timber was sent to Brisbane for milling. During the 1930s revenue from the Brisbane Valley line was greater than expenditure on the line and by 1938 revenue exceeded expenditure and interest on the capital for its construction. In the 1930s and 1940s the Brisbane Valley Line to Esk handled a large volume of passengers and goods due to the construction of Somerset Dam on the Stanley River for flood mitigation and water storage for Brisbane, Ipswich and the lower Brisbane Valley. From 1935 the Brisbane Valley Rail Line handled construction material for the site. Esk became the transhipping depot equipped with cranes for heavy loads. Goods were then transported to the dam site along of bitumen road that the Stanley River Works Board, in conjunction with the Mains Road Commission, constructed for this purpose. Somerset dam was completed in 1959 after a period of abeyance from 1942 to 1948 due to World War II. Post-war, as road transport replaced rail for both goods and passengers, usage of the Brisbane Valley rail line declined. In 1955 the concrete and steel bridge over Emu Creek, which was built at the same time as Harlin Rail Bridge, was washed away by flood waters and was later rebuilt in timber. After this flood pier number 6 of Harlin Rail Bridge was filled in with concrete for additional support. In 1961 piers 3, 4 and 5 were strengthened. After flood damage in 1974 the Brisbane Valley Branch Line was threatened with permanent closure but re-opened after several months. Nevertheless, the last Yarraman rail motor ran on 6 October 1988. Afterwards a passenger service operated from Ipswich to Toogoolawah until March 1993 when the Brisbane Valley Branch Line closed. The steel track, many of the bridges, most railway signage, station platforms and goods sheds have been removed. Many of the station buildings on the Brisbane Valley Rail Line have been re- used on other lines or sold for removal. The only remaining buildings are at Yarraman, Linville and Lowood (now serving as railway museums) and Toogoolawah, Esk and Coominya. Much of the railway infrastructure from Blackbutt to Moore and from Wulkuraka to Lowood has been removed. The bridge was severely damaged during flooding in 2013 caused by Cyclone Oswald, with most of the structure reported to have been washed away. The secretary of the Brisbane Valley Rail Trail stated at the time \\"I can't say whether the damage can be repaired at this time; I must say in fairness that the damage is very extensive\\", while following that they would \\"explore funding options for its restoration\\". A 2016 article described the bridge as having been \\"lost\\". Following the destruction of the bridge, there are now only two large engineering structures left on the Brisbane Valley rail line. These are the steel and timber Lockyer Creek railway bridge over Lockyer Creek at Clarendon designed by Chief Engineer HC Stanley and the Yimbun Railway Tunnel. Approximately two dozen timber rail bridges are still intact, although their condition varies greatly.  Description  Harlin Rail Bridge, 2008 The Harlin Rail Bridge was a high-level steel and concrete bridge over Maronghi Creek, located from Wulkuraka on the former Brisbane Valley Branch Rail Line. Its total length was and its maximum span was . The bridge had two steel 8 panel half-through Pratt trusses and was supported by two concrete abutments and six concrete piers. It had a long, earth embankment approach from the north (approximately ) and a shorter approach from the south (approximately ). The bridge comprised (south-north): * 2 x 3 x rolled steel joists, concrete abutment, common concrete piers * 2 x 8 panel through Pratt trusses, common concrete piers * 3 x 3 x rolled steel joists, common concrete piers, concrete abutment. It retained its sleepers and rail lines until its destruction.  Heritage listing  Harlin Rail Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 November 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Harlin Rail Bridge, opened in 1910, is important surviving evidence of the Brisbane Valley Branch Rail Line. Establishment of Queensland's branch rail network, which began in the 1880s, was vital for the development of the colony through opening land for closer settlement and freighting produce and resources to Queensland's major towns and ports. The Brisbane Valley Rail Line, when commenced in 1882, was the second of Queensland's branch lines. Over the ensuing 30 years it was extended several times to facilitate the transportation of timber, livestock and agricultural produce and was intended to become an alternative, shorter route from the South Burnett to Brisbane. In contrast to other branch lines, revenue from the Brisbane Valley Branch Line was greater than its expenses for the majority of the period from 1902 until the outbreak of World War II when reporting by the Commissioner of Railways on the profitability of individual lines ceased. The Harlin Rail Bridge is one of only two surviving major rail bridges of the Brisbane Valley Branch Line, the other being the Lockyer Creek Railway Bridge at Clarendon. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Harlin Rail Bridge is a form of railway bridge that has always been uncommon and remains so. It is one of approximately seven half-through Pratt truss bridges that were built by the Queensland Department of Railways and Public Works during the first two decades of the twentieth century. The structure is intact and retains a high level of integrity. Other bridges of this type known to have been constructed include the Comet River bridge, Comet (superstructure replaced 2005); Reid River bridge, Reid River (demolished); Reids Creek bridge, Gayndah (extant); Barmundu bridge, Barmundu (modified); and Yabba Creek bridge, Imbil (intact). The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Harlin Rail Bridge is a good example of a half-through Pratt truss railway bridge designed by the Department of Railways and Public Works while William Pagan was Chief Engineer. This bridge type differed subtly from the through Pratt truss in that its girders are not high enough to allow cross bracing at the top of the truss, which is a feature of through Pratt truss bridges. The bridge is highly intact and provides physical evidence of early twentieth century railway bridge design and construction in Queensland. The Harlin Rail Bridge illustrates the evolution in the principal characteristics of steel railway bridges around the turn of the century, especially the change to the through and half-through Pratt trusses from 1908, which increased the structural strength of rail bridges.

College remediation According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 10% of Blacklick Valley School District graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in mathematics, reading or English. Dual enrollment Blacklick Valley Junior Senior High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. Courses are available through IU8 and from Mount Aloysius College. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Dual Enrollment Guidelines, 2010 Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are home schooled are eligible to participate in this program. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state budget crisis. In 2013, funding was available through Pennsylvania‚Äôs Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) Program. For the 2009-10 funding year, the Blacklick Valley School District received a state grant of $2,354 for the program. ;AP Courses As of 2014, Blacklick Valley Junior Senior High School does not offer Advanced Placement (AP) courses.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - Blacklick Valley Senior High School, December 2014 Graduation requirements Among Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts, graduation requirements vary widely. The Blacklick Valley School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 23 credits to graduate, including: a required class every year in Language Arts and social studies, Math 3 credits, science 3 credits, Physical Education 1credit each school year and electives 8 electives. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students were required to complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Literature exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP.

They averaged 497 (out of 800) verbal, 514 math and 489 in writing. The Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a research arm of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, compared the SAT data of students in rural areas of Pennsylvania to students in urban areas. From 2003 to 2005, the average total SAT score for students in rural Pennsylvania was 992, while urban students averaged 1,006. During the same period, 28 percent of 11th and 12th graders in rural school districts took the exam, compared to 32 percent of urban students in the same grades. The average math and verbal scores were 495 and 497, respectively, for rural students, while urban test-takers averaged 499 and 507, respectively. Pennsylvania‚Äôs SAT composite score ranked low on the national scale in 2004. The composite SAT score of 1,003 left Pennsylvania ranking 44 out of the 50 states and Washington, DC. The Pennsylvania Department of Education reported that 71 percent of students in rural areas of Pennsylvania chose to continue their education after high school in 2003, whereas 79 percent of urban high school graduates opted to continue their education. Junior high school The seventh grade is tested in reading and mathematics every school year. Eight grade is tested in reading, math, science, and writing each year. Students who take Algebra I take the Keystone Exam at the end of the course. Beginning in 2013, the results are combined with the high school results in the School Performance Profile for public reporting although the administration continues to receive results by grade. The testing of 8th grade in reading and mathematics began in 1999, as a state initiative. The standards were published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.

The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The Blacklick Valley School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08, the District received $72,372. The District received $41,414 in 2008-09. The funds were used to purchase 91 student laptops, 13 teacher laptops. Also purchased and installed were 13 interactive whiteboards and ceiling mounted LCD projectors. Among the public school districts in Cambria County, the highest award was given to Greater Johnstown School District which received $463,166. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. Wellness policy Blacklick Valley School Board has an established district wellness policy.Blacklick Valley School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, 2015 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required each school district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Blacklick Valley School District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Blacklick Valley School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health‚Äôs extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. School safety and bullying The Blacklick Valley School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in Blacklick Valley Junior Senior High School in 2014. There was: an assault on a student, 2 incidents of harassment and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in seven incidents at the school, with five arrests. Each year the school safety data is reported by the District's administration to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The Blacklick Valley School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Extracurriculars Blacklick Valley School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, publicly funded sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 Athletics Blacklick Valley junior senior High School coaches receive compensation as outlined in the District's teachers union contract.

All school entities with grades 7-12 are required to annually collect data concerning team and financial information for all male and female athletes beginning with the 2012-13 school year and submit the information to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Beginning with the 2013-14 school year, all non-school (booster club and alumni) contributions and purchases must also be reported to PDE. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports. According to Pennsylvania‚Äôs Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching. ;Varsity: ;Boys: * Football - Class A * Basketball - Class A * Baseball - Class A * Track and Field - Class AA ;Girls: * Basketball - Class A * Softball - Class A * Track and Field - Class AA ;Junior High Middle School Sports: ;Boys: *Basketball *Football ;Girls: *Basketball According to PIAA directory June 2015 References Schools in Cambria County, Pennsylvania 1967 establishments in Pennsylvania Public high schools in Pennsylvania ","title":"Blacklick Valley Junior Senior High School"},{"id":"47158289","text":"Andy Gibson (born 2 February 1969) is a Scottish former footballer, who played for Stirling Albion, Aberdeen, Stockport County (on loan), Partick Thistle, Clyde, Forfar Athletic and Peterhead.

Location A view to the Sazlƒ±dere Valley and Lake B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece seen from the cave. Yarƒ±mburgaz Cave is approximately west of the city of Istanbul, and about north of Lake K√º√ß√ºk√ßekmece and south of Sazlƒ±dere Dam. It is situated in a locality known today as Altƒ±n≈üehir, within the neighborhood of G√ºvercintepe in Ba≈üak≈üehir district. Geology and formation The cave was formed as a result of a subterranean river eroding an ancient limestone formation. It has two entrances, one above the other. The lower entrance is at an altitude of AMSL, which the upper entrance is situated above. The cave is on the eastern bank of the Sazlƒ±dere creek, which empties into Lake K√º√ß√ºk√ßekmece. The entrances face southwards overlooking Sazlƒ±dere Valley. Whereas the lower cave has a length of , the upper is only long. After about inside, a short, sloping passage connects both caves. The lower cave is in the form of a meandering tunnel, forking into two at a distance of from the mouth. The upper cave's chamber is wide and in height. Scientific research Artifacts from Yarƒ±mburgaz Cave displayed at Istanbul Archaeology Museums. The cave is an important fossil site which has been researched by archeologists, paleontologists, geoarchaeologists and biospeleologists. Scientific exploration of the cave began in the mid-19th century. Excavation attempts made in 1920 were followed by systematic archaeological work in the 1980s financially supported by the National Geographic Society. In the Byzantine era, a cave-church was carved into the walls of the upper cave, and a monastery was built outside the cave mouth. Although these alterations may have resulted in the loss of prehistoric material, some artefacts remain in the cave. In the upper cave, traces of settlements were found dating back to the Upper Paleolithic subdivision of the Stone Age up until the Chalcolithic period of the Bronze Age. These traces were lying on beach sand from the last interglacial period and beneath debris from Byzantine and later times. The beach sand covers sediments with Lower Paleolithic artifacts. The upper cave was destroyed by treasure hunting and illicit diggings, which left -deep pits. Unlike the prehistoric deposits found in the lower cave, the upper cave lacks any evidence of debris from that era. The existence of paleontological and archaeological findings point towards the use of the cave as a human and an animal habitat, alternatively. The finds include bones of herbivore and carnivore mammals, marine and freshwater molluscs, microfauna as well as artifacts like potsherds, knives on flint, oldowans, choppers and hammerstones on quartzite, as well as manuports. The wide variety of prehistoric faunal specimens belong to bones of herbivore mammals such as cave bears (Ursus deningeri), horses (Equus caballus), wild boars (Sus scrofa), fallow deer (Dama dama), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), deer (Megaloceros), cattle (Bos/Bison), antilopes (Gazella), goats (Capra), and carnivores such as wolves and dogs (Canis), foxes (Vulpes), tigers (Panthera), cats (Felis) and hyenas (Crocuta). Findings of \\"more than 5000 fossil bones and teeth of cave and brown bears\\", which provide some chronological indicators, led to their extensive scientific study. Another subject of such extensive study were the fossils of several species of Middle Pleistocene bats (Chiroptera), including horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus), mouse-eared bats (Myotis), long-eared bats (Plecotus) and bent-winged bats (Miniopterus). Some artifacts found in Yarƒ±mburgaz Cave are exhibited in the Istanbul Archaeology Museums. In 2001, Yarƒ±mburgaz Cave was declared an archaeological-nature reserve of first grade. It is also listed as \\"Cultural Property under Enhanced Protection\\". Human impact Barred main entrance of lower cave. A view of the cave inside at the main entrance of lower cave. During the last two decades, the cave suffered serious, irreversible damage caused by the external interactions of humans. Following scientific excavations inside the cave, and the related publications in the 1990s, the cave gained wide popularity. For this reason, it was brought to the attention of several picnickers, treasure hunters, illegal explorers, amateur speleologists and archaeologists due to its past use as a historic cave-church and its proximity to the city center. In order to prevent further damage, the cave was closed off with iron bar gates during the scientific excavations between 1988 and 1990. However, because of neglect by the respective authorities, the gates lost their function in later years, and the cave would inevitably become a shelter frequented by drug users and prostitutes, who littered it. Currently, the cave walls are painted and scratched with graffiti. To establish a mushroom farm inside the cave, the cave grounds were leveled by a grader. The mouth of the cave was enlarged even to enable the grader's entry. The cave was also used several times as a setting in filmmaking and television productions that left permanent modifications inside the cave. The cave featured in the 1971 movie Ali Baba ve Kƒ±rk Haramiler (English: \\"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\\"), based on the folk tale Ali Baba, with a role as the treasure cave that opens with the magic words \\"open sesame\\" and closes off with \\"close sesame\\", respectively. For the filming of an episode of the television series K√º√ß√ºk Aƒüa (English: \\"Little Agha\\"), historic frescos on the cave walls were scratched off and removed, and some of them were painted over with exit signs. During the filming of the science-fiction movie Yorr‚Äôun √ñyk√ºs√º (English: \\"The Story of Yorr\\"), a large pool was built inside the cave, which was then detonated by explosives according to the scenario. The cave also became a setting for the television comedy series Leyla ile Mecnun produced by the state-owned Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in which fire was set to depict hell. The filming of some episodes of the television series Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l (English: \\"The Magnificent Century\\"), a prime-time historical soap opera, inside the cave without proper permission allegedly caused damage to the cave. As such, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism filed a complaint against the producers. A group of local politicians inspected the cave in February 2015, and reported that the cave's protection is still neglected despite its importance and status.

Originally a high-fashion brand creating bespoke (made-to-measure) shoes, it was regularly featured in catwalk shows and the fashion press throughout the 1970s, when it also had a retail presence in New York City. It was twice chosen as part of the Dress of the Year ensemble displayed at the Fashion Museum, Bath. Later the brand was absorbed into larger fashion companies. It was relaunched in 2009. Brand establishment The Chelsea Cobbler's first store opened in April 1967 in Draycott Avenue, Chelsea. The founders were Richard Smith (also the shoe designer), Amanda Wilkins and George Macfarlane. Writing in The Times in 1968, Antony King-Deacon said the brand's shoes cost from 9 guineas and the founders were: \\"trying to get the public to accept well-made, rather expensive shoes\\". King-Deacon's comments were within an article bemoaning the poor quality of mass shoe production and describing the re-emergence of small and bespoke designers. This was in an era when the UK shoe market was dominated by lower- priced brands within the British Shoe Corporation; its stores accounted for an estimated 25 to 30 per cent of retail shoe sales in the UK at the end of the 1960s. The factory which was in Mornington Crescent was run by Spiros Mina and Antony Achilleos. Arty Achilleos was an apprentice here. He later started his own business Baboucha. A year later, Prudence Glynn featured The Chelsea Cobbler, alongside Rayne, Moya Bowler, Ravel and Magli in an article about London's best specialist shoe shops. By this stage, the brand also had a shoe shop in Sackville Street in the West End. Also in 1969, Richard Smith of Chelsea Cobbler and Glen Carr of Norvic were chosen to show off the versatility of a new leather substitute created by British company Chloride Electrical Storage Company and known as Porvair. Smith's shoes were worn with men's clothing created by hip womenswear designer Clive Evans at the launch event. In 1969, Mirabel Walker described it as among a crop of new shoe design companies that had caught up with continental Europe's design approach, saying: \\"The Chelsea Cobbler...make shoes in any colour, any style, to suit any foot\\". 1970s expansion In 1970, The Chelsea Cobbler was chosen as part of the Dress of the Year ensemble. Its blue suede boots were worn in combination with a Bill Gibb plaid maxi skirt and a waistcoat by Kaffe Fassett. The outfit's selector was Vogue editor Beatrix Miller. Also in 1970, The Times featured its novelty canvas boots supplied with iron-on transfers, enabling people to customise their footwear by decorating the canvas in acrylic paints. The boots were priced at 12 guineas a pair. By this stage, as Prudence Glynn reported, fashionable shoppers were in the grip of boot \\"fever\\": \\"The British, of course, love queueing and the new generation of standers in line can be seen any day in The Chelsea Cobbler or Annello and Davide preparing to wait eight to 12 weeks for a pair of boots to be made. The boot fever is such that even the Parisiennes must wait because stocks sell as fast as they are delivered\\". In 1971, the company was among the accessories designers featured in an exhibition showcasing British talent at The Louvre ‚Äì at the invitation of the director of Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs ‚Äì entitled L'Idee de la Forme. Fashion designers in the mix included Christopher McDonnell, Barbara Hulanicki, Mary Quant, Jean Muir, Bill Gibb and Beatrice Bellini. That year, the company was also producing boots ‚Äì wide-legged and in quilted suede with wooden heel and platform ‚Äì for main branches of Russell & Bromley. In 1972, a branch opened in New York City. By 1973, The Chelsea Cobbler had its own department within Harrods' 'Way In' fashion department. Prudence Glynn reported that the leather company Barrow Hepburn had taken a controlling interest, saying: \\"I approve of Barrow Hepburn's controlling interest in Chelsea Cobbler. Richard Smith, who heads the latter, has very sensitive antennae and a very sure style. With Manolo Blahnik of Zapata, he shares the favours to top fashion designers in this country who use his shoes to complement their clothes\\". Two years later, The Chelsea Cobbler was once again chosen as part of the Dress of the Year ensemble, this time for a pair of men's shoes worn with a Tommy Nutter suit and chosen by the editor of the UK edition of Brides. In 1976, it was reported that Richard Smith would be creating a shoe design for Rayne. By 1978, The Chelsea Cobbler had branches in New Bond Street, Fulham Road and King's Road, as well as concessions in Harrods and Bentalls in Kingston. In 1979, Rayne acquired The Chelsea Cobbler business from Barrow Hepburn for ¬£150,000. Later history In 1993, both The Chelsea Cobbler brand and Rayne were absorbed into Nine West, an American shoe company that would later buy Pied a Terre. By 2004, the brand was part of Shoe Studio Group. By 2008, it was under the ownership of Baugur Group. In 2009, Shoe Studio Group assets were sold to the footwear brand Dune Group. Chelsea Cobbler was relaunched as a menswear brand by Dune in 2009. Standalone stores were opened in South Molton Street and Fenwick in Brent Cross Shopping Centre. In 2012, a Chelsea Cobbler men's shoes concession opened within Topman Oxford Circus. These stores however were closed by Dune.

It was designed by Queensland Railways and built from 1909 to 1910 by Queensland Railways. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 November 2008.  History  The Yimbun Railway Tunnel, located from Wulkuraka railway station, is a concrete-lined tunnel built between 1909 and 1910. It is the only railway tunnel on the Brisbane Valley railway line. This line was developed as a branch line from the main Brisbane-Toowoomba rail line. It was constructed from Wulkuraka near Ipswich to Lowood (1884) then extended to Esk (1886) then Toogoolawah (February 1904), Yimbun (September 1904), Linville (1910), Benarkin and Blackbutt (1911) and finally to Yarraman (1913). Originally intended that the line would eventually meet the Gympie to Nanango rail line to serve as a rail connection to Gympie and a shorter route between the South Burnett and Brisbane, the final linking section was never constructed. The Upper Brisbane Valley was settled by squatters in the 1840s and the timber industry in the Brisbane Valley also dates from this period. Closer settlement began in the 1870s. The timber industry quickly developed thereafter as land was rapidly cleared by selectors and the increased population of Brisbane and Ipswich from the 1870s demanded timber for housing and fuel on a continuing basis. The first sawmills in the Brisbane Valley, established in the 1870s, were located at Rosewood, Dundas and Colinton. Closer settlement of the Brisbane Valley had progressed sufficiently by 1877 for the country from Walloon via Esk and Nanango to be examined as a possible route for a railway to Gympie. In 1879 Queensland Premier Thomas McIlwraith approved the building of several branch lines, including one to Esk. However, the original plans for these branch lines were withdrawn from parliamentary consideration in 1880 on the recommendation of FT Gregory, MLC. In spite of this opposition, in 1881 the Queensland Parliament approved the building of the Brisbane Valley branch line from Wulkuraka to Esk. The contract for the first section was let to O'Rourke and McSharry in October 1882 with Henry Charles Stanley acting as Chief Engineer. This section to Lowood, a place that scarcely existed before the railway, opened on 16 June 1884. The Brisbane Valley Branch Line was the second branch line in Queensland after the Dugandan railway line, which opened to Harrisville in 1882. Within weeks an extension of the line from Lowood to Esk was approved in August 1884 by Premier Samuel Griffith. HC Stanley remained as Chief Engineer but HA Brigg was appointed as the contractor. The second section to Esk opened on 9 August 1886 and remained the terminus for more than 17 years, becoming an important centre and livestock loading point. During the 1880s closer settlement of the Brisbane Valley intensified. Land from Cressbrook Station was resumed and settled. In 1889 James McConnel began selling off small parcels of land from his property Cressbrook to his workers for dairying. The railway, which provided rapid and cheap transport to Brisbane, fostered the timber industry's development. Over the next 30 years sawmills were established at Lowood, Esk, Toogoolawah, Moore, Linville, Harlin, Blackbutt, Monsildale and Perseverance as well as a number of portable sawmills operating in stands of timber. In the late nineteenth century four dairy factories operated in the Brisbane Valley and utilised the railway for transporting milk and its products. Lowood dairy factory opened in 1890. Toogoolawah dairy factory (managed by Cressbrook Dairy Company) and Colinton Dairy Factory (managed by Standard Dairy Co Ltd) opened in 1898, while the Esk dairy factory opened in 1904. Circa 1898 Cressbrook Condensed Milk Factory, owned by James McConnel and owner/manager Colin Munro, opened on the banks of Cressbrook Creek. The factory and seven dairy farms that supplied it were purchased by Nestl√© in 1907 and remained in operation until 1930 with local dairy farmers supplying its milk. In 1900 a parliamentary inquiry was conducted to determine the best route for a proposed rail line to Nanango. James McConnel of Cressbrook stated that an extension of the Brisbane Valley Railway Line would enable selectors to pursue dairying rather than grazing and to cultivate the land. The inquiry subsequently recommended a extension of the Brisbane Valley Branch Line to Moore, which was approved in December of the same year. The first section, to the new township of Toogoolawah, which was the site of the Cressbrook Condensed Milk Factory, opened on 8 February 1904. On 1 September 1904 the extension to Yimbun was opened and remained the terminus until 1910. To access the vast timber resources beyond Yimbun a further extension of the line to Blackbutt was considered. The Blackbutt Tableland was notable as a rich farming district, that the railway was expected to expand. On the ranges hoop and bunya pines were already being exploited, and with conservation it was expected that freight for the railway would be supplied for many years. At Moore there were two sawmills operating and there were two more in the Blackbutt area. Plans for the of rail line from Yimbun to Blackbutt were approved at a Committee meeting on SS Lucinda on 9 January 1907. They were introduced into Parliament on 13 March 1908 and passed on 1 April 1908. In early 1909 Queensland Railways purchased materials for the construction of this line. The Yimbun Tunnel, located between Harlin and Yimbun, was designed by Resident Engineer, Hugh Fraser and built by day labourers between February 1909 and May 1910. Relative to their length, tunnels are the most costly of all forms of railway engineering and their problems include hazards such as rock falls. Material must be removed from the bore itself and disposed of. Few types of rock are sufficiently hard to be allowed to remain after excavation without a lining of masonry or concrete. Yimbun Tunnel was constructed as a concrete-lined straight tunnel with a 1-in-165 gradient rising towards Yarraman. Material from its bore was deposited into Banks Number 14 and 15 on either side of the tunnel's approaches. The section of line that included the Yimbun Tunnel opened on 22 November 1910 and the extension to Blackbutt was completed during 1911. The next section of the Brisbane Valley Rail Line, to Yarraman, was approved by parliament in December 1910 and opened on 1 May 1913. The last section required to complete the loop to Gympie was approved by parliament on 30 October 1918 but was never built. This section of the Brisbane Valley Rail Line was built under the 1895 Railways Guarantee Act which provided for local authorities to request construction of a railway by guaranteeing to meet any losses and the interest on capital borrowed for construction. The Railways Department was also required to share any deficit equally with the guarantors. The guarantee ended after 14 years unless a profit was made for three consecutive years, at which time it ceased. The cost to the residents in the benefited area served by the rail line including the Yimbun Railway Tunnel in the financial year 1913-1914 was ¬£3389. Of this amount the Esk Shire Council paid ¬£2000, Crow's Nest Shire Council ¬£194, Nanango Shire Council ¬£490 and Treasury ¬£705. The nett revenue of the Brisbane Valley Branch Line was positive until the 1917-18. The line experienced a period of losses until 1932 after which it again returned substantial nett revenues. Passenger services were a feature of the Brisbane Valley Line from the commencement of the service. From 1913 a passenger service ran from Yarraman to Ipswich three days a week, taking six hours. In 1928 rail motor services commenced on the Brisbane Valley railway line and when new rail motors were introduced. The Brisbane Valley line, together with the Fassifern line, was the first to use them. Although limited to and averaging no more than they were faster, smoother, more comfortable and more reliable than road transport or mixed trains. By 1920 much of the forest timber had been cut out of the Brisbane Valley and the major industry was dairying. Accordingly, in the 1920s, the railway was transporting cream to the butter factories along the Brisbane Valley line - Colinton until 1921, Toogoolawah, Esk and Lowood. Whole milk was transported to the Nestl√© and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Factory at Toogoolawah until its closure in 1930. However, on the Blackbutt Range timber was still being cut and transported via rail. In 1934 The Courier-Mail reported increased timber haulage from railway loading centres between Benarkin and Yarraman. The amount was more than 1,500,000 super feet per month over the prior 12 months and formed the biggest proportion of freight on the Brisbane Valley railway line. All the timber was being cut from Crown reserves as privately held land was practically cut out. Most of the timber was sent to Brisbane for milling. During the 1930s revenue from the Brisbane Valley line was greater than expenditure on the line and by 1938 revenue exceeded expenditure and interest on the capital for its construction. In the 1930s and 1940s the Brisbane Valley Line to Esk handled a large volume of passengers and goods due to the construction of Somerset Dam on the Stanley River for flood mitigation and water storage for Brisbane, Ipswich and the lower Brisbane Valley. From 1935 the Brisbane Valley Rail Line handled construction material for the site. Esk became the transhipping depot equipped with cranes for heavy loads. Goods were then transported to the dam site along of bitumen road that the Stanley River Works Board, in conjunction with the Mains Road Commission, constructed for this purpose. Somerset dam was completed in 1959 after a period of abeyance from 1942 to 1948 due to World War II. Post-war, as road transport replaced rail for both goods and passengers, usage of the Brisbane Valley rail line declined. After flood damage in the 1974 the Brisbane Valley Branch Line was threatened with permanent closure but re-opened after several months. Nevertheless, the last Yarraman rail motor ran on 6 October 1988. Afterwards a passenger service operated from Ipswich to Toogoolawah until March 1993 when the Brisbane Valley Branch Line closed. The steel track, many of the bridges, most railway signage, station platforms and goods sheds have been removed. Many of the station buildings on the Brisbane Valley Rail Line have been re-used on other lines or sold for removal. The only remaining buildings are at Yarraman, Linville and Lowood (now serving as railway museums) and Toogoolawah, Esk and Coominya. Much of the railway infrastructure from Blackbutt to Moore and from Wulkuraka to Lowood has been removed. There are now only three large engineering structures left on the Brisbane Valley rail line. These are the steel and timber Lockyer Creek railway bridge over Lockyer Creek at Clarendon designed by Chief Engineer HC Stanley; the steel and concrete Harlin Rail Bridge over Maronghi Creek at Harlin; and the Yimbun Railway Tunnel. Approximately two dozen timber rail bridges are still intact, although their condition varies greatly.  Description  Yimbun Railway Tunnel is located between and from Wulkuraka station along the former Brisbane Valley Branch Line formation and is sited beneath a saddle between two knolls. Yimbun Railway Tunnel is a semi-elliptical, concrete-lined, straight tunnel that is long and has a gradient of 1:165 against north-bound traffic. It has an earthen floor and is approximately high at its apex. Both portals feature the date \\"1910\\". The cuttings that form the approaches on the north and south sides of the tunnel extend for approximately and approximately respectively.  Heritage listing  Yimbun Railway Tunnel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 November 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Yimbun Railway Tunnel is important surviving evidence of the Brisbane Valley Branch Rail Line. Development of Queensland's branch rail network, which began in the 1880s, was vital for the development of the colony through opening land for closer settlement and freighting produce and resources to Queensland's major towns and ports. The Brisbane Valley Rail Line, when commenced in 1882, was the second of Queensland's branch lines. Over the next 30 years it was extended several times to facilitate the transport of timber, livestock and agricultural produce and was intended to become an alternative, shorter route from the South Burnett to Brisbane. In contrast to other branch lines, revenue from the Brisbane Valley Branch Line was greater than its expenses for the majority of the period from 1902 until the outbreak of World War II when reporting by the Commissioner of Railways on the profitability of individual lines ceased. The Yimbun Railway Tunnel, constructed in 1910 on the section between Yimbun and Blackbutt, is the only tunnel constructed along the entire Brisbane Valley Branch Line and one of only three remaining intact major rail structures on the Brisbane Valley Rail Line, the others being the Lockyer Creek Railway Bridge at Clarendon and the Harlin Rail Bridge. Of the 55 railway tunnels constructed in Queensland between 1865 and 1931, only nine are recorded as located on branch lines. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Yimbun Railway Tunnel is significant as a highly intact example of a concrete-lined railway tunnel constructed for Queensland's narrow-gauge railway lines. Concrete was first used as a tunnel lining in 1880 and since then has been used for approximately two dozen railway tunnels constructed in Queensland.

These storms frequently produce hail that is damaging to property. This area stretches from High River in southern Alberta, northward through Calgary, through Red Deer to Lacombe and then westward to Rocky Mountain House. It is known to be one of the worst areas in the world for damaging hail produced by thunderstorms. These are regarded as loose boundaries. While this area is common for damaging hailstorms, the reality is damaging hailstorms occur over much of central and southern Alberta every summer. The City of Calgary is regarded as the hailstorm capital of Canada.https://dgidirect.ca/alberta/home- insurance/home-tips/expensive-deadly-hailstorms-albertas-history/ Examples of previous storms In 1991, the City of Calgary experienced a storm that caused $342 million in damages. At the time, it was the most damaging hail storm in Canadian history. Then on 12 July 2010, the City of Calgary experienced a storm that produced four centimetre wide hail stones. This storm caused $400 million in damages, beating the previous record. In August 2014, Hailstorm Alley experienced numerous severe storms that cost $450 million in insured damages. These storms were recorded in Calgary, Airdrie, Red Deer and Rocky Mountain House. On June 30, 2016, a damaging storm hit the central Alberta town of Ponoka, causing $50 million in damages. This storm produced large hail as well as a tornado. In May 2017, a damaging storm hit the central Alberta city of Lacombe, causing $68 million in damages.https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/hail-wind-heavy-rain-cause- more-than-200m-in-damage-across-the-prairies In July 2018, severe storms hit central Alberta, resulting in $80 million in damages. https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/hail-wind-heavy-rain-cause-more- than-200m-in-damage-across-the-prairies On June 13, 2020, a severe storm hit the Cities of Calgary and Airdrie causing extensive damage and flash flooding. The damages have been calculated at around $1.5 billion making this the 4th costliest natural disaster in Canadian history. Cloud seeding and insurers In 1996, insurance companies formed the Alberta Severe Weather Management Society and began the Alberta Hail Suppression Project. This project uses cloud seeding techniques to lessen the severity of hail storms. This society had budgeted $2.5 million in 2012 to run the suppression project, with the potential to save insurers many times this amount during one single storm by reducing claims.

He was claimed to have exhibited psychic ability even in early childhood. His family encouraged his activities, including taking him to the spiritualist community of Lake Pleasant, Massachusetts where Elwood would assist in the readings. Babbitt had two primary spirit guides, Dr. Fischer and Jim Cole, who helped him. Jim Cole was the \\"Engineer\\" who helped to adjust the supposed vibrational frequencies between spirit and Elwood's body. Elwood claimed that he and Dr. Fischer took turns helping each other across lives, e.g. in other lives he was in spirit assisting Dr. Fischer with his mediumship in an earth body. World War II Babbitt served in World War II as a Marine in the Second Division. Babbitt claimed to have predicted the attack on Pearl Harbor and even told his fellow Marines the day and approximate time of the coming attack. He claimed to have witnessed the spirits as points of light as they left the bodies of the soldiers in the water. Throughout various battles in Asia, Elwood's purported abilities allowed him to lead his division safely, as he claimed to have been guided by spirits who helped him avoid danger. Other Marines in his division gave him the nickname \\"The Mystic\\". With physical death a fact of everyday life in the war, Elwood was able to comfort his fellow Marines with his knowledge. Charles Hapgood In the late 1960s, Babbitt met Charles Hapgood. Charles Hapgood was a professor at Keene State in New Hampshire. During one of his college courses, he performed successful experiments in hypnosis, including, it was claimed, sending one of his students forward into the future by several days and reporting on his night out.Hapgood 1975 Knowing that Hapgood had an interest in exploring all things scientific, one of his students suggested that he meet Elwood. Hapgood co-authored three books with Babbitt. The first, \\"Voices of Spirit\\" is a scientific and historical approach to the world of mediumship. The second book \\"The God Within - A Testament of Vishnu\\" and third book \\"Talks With Christ and His Teachers\\" are primarily transcriptions of trance lectures claimed to have been given by the Vishnu Force, Jesus Christ, and other figures. The Brotherhood of Spirit (Renaissance Community) In the 1970s Babbitt became the spiritual counsellor and mentor to a commune called The Brotherhood of the Spirit (renamed Renaissance Community) located in Warwick, Massachusetts. Caduceus School Also in the 1970s, Babbitt co- founded the Caduceus School. Caduceus School allowed students the freedom to choose their curriculum. The Caduceus school helped to pave the way for the broader adoption of Home Schooling in Massachusetts.Babbitt 2005 Illness and death During World War II Babbitt was exposed to cordite poisoning which impaired his lung capacity.

These practices were current through the early to mid 20th century, and were characterised by a paternalistic attitude, surrogate decision-making and a lack of respect for patient autonomy. It is almost exclusively undertaken with the intention of benefiting the patient, although this is not always the case. In the past, paternalism was considered an absolute medical necessity, as there was little to no public understanding of medical procedures and practices. However, in recent years, paternalism has become limited and blind faith in doctors' decisions has come to be frowned upon. By the end of the 20th century and into the 21st, paternalistic medicine was increasingly seen as inappropriate in the West with guidance from professional bodies such as the General Medical Council indicating that it is ethically unsupportable.  History  In the 18th century, medical paternalism was considered necessary. It was believed that only a doctor could properly understand symptoms and draw useful conclusions. During this period, the prevailing consensus was that disease was nothing more than symptoms. This meant that the individual history of the patient didn't matter in providing care, so the patient him or herself was irrelevant in the medical encounter. Thus it was deemed necessary that physicians make decisions for patients. This view of paternalism was only encouraged by the rise of hospitals in the later 18th century. Because patients in hospitals were often sick and disabled, the view of them as passive recipients of medical care only became more prevalent. The movement away from paternalism can be traced back to the relationship between early psychologists and their patients. In particular, Josef Breuer and Sigmund Freud urged that importance be placed on communication with and understanding of the patient. This sharply contrasted the view of patients as passive, and placed them at the center of the medical encounter. These practices also treated patients as unique, instead of simply being a collection of symptoms to be fixed by a paternalistic doctor. In 1956, Szasz and HollenderSzasz, T. S., & Hollender, M. H. (1956). \\"The Basic Models of the Doctor-Patient Relationship.\\" Archives of Internal Medicine, 97, 585‚Äì592. introduced three models of paternalism to the medical community, thereby legitimizing the view that doctors did not necessarily have to dominate patients. The models are as follows: * Activity‚Äîpassivity refers to the traditional version of paternalism, in which the doctor treats the patient as one who cannot or should not make decisions. This relationship is similar to that of a parent and child. Treatment is performed \\"irrespective of the patient's contribution and regardless of outcome.\\" This model is considered justified in emergency situations in which there is no time to consider the patient's preferences or contributions. * Guidance‚Äîco-operation is a relationship used in more long- term situations. The doctor provides instructions to the patient, to which the patient is expected to comply. The name comes from the expectation that the physician will guide the patient, who will co-operate, but who retains their individuality. * Mutual participation involves the physician making it clear that he or she is not infallible and does not always know what is best. This model is more of a partnership, in which the doctor helps the patient to help him or herself. This model is often employed in cases of chronic disease or pain, in which the patient can have a higher degree of freedom and be more independent of the doctor.  Strong vs. weak paternalism  Strong and weak paternalism (sometimes referred to as limited and extended paternalism) are two philosophies regarding when it is appropriate for a doctor to ignore a patient's wishes. The fundamental difference lies in the patient's capacity to make well-informed decisions for themselves. Weak (or limited) paternalism refers to a situation in which the physician will only disobey the patient's requests if the patient cannot demonstrate that their choices are voluntary and well-informed. As such, even if the doctor disagrees with the patient's desire, he or she will not intervene as long as the patient is of sound mind. Strong (or extended) paternalism involves a doctor superseding a patient's requests in cases where the doctor has determined a better course of action, even when the patient's requests are made voluntarily. These cases typically arise when the physician has determined that a patient's decision is unreasonable because of the risks involved, or potential costs to the patient's well-being.  Legality  Due to the subjective nature of when and to what extent paternalism is necessary, physicians who engage in paternalism may find themselves in a complicated legal situation. Throughout history there have been many cases in which a patient is reported to have made a well- informed choice (while of sound mind) to opt for a medically improper treatment, or one that is very costly to their well-being. If the doctor does not take a paternalistic stance, and instead goes through with the patient's wishes, the question arises as to whether malpractice occurred. There exists an expectation of doctors to provide as much information as is appropriate to their patients, as well as an expectation that they do not keep anything relevant secret. This creates a difficult legal situation in which a decision has to be made about what the correct amount of information is, and how best to present it. For example, a patient may read everything available to them and ultimately decide on undergoing a procedure with a 95% survival rate. However, that same patient may not choose the same procedure if it is presented as carrying a 5% risk of dying. As such, in cases in which things go awry it is the courts' responsibility to determine whether the physician is at fault, and whether he or she should have ignored the patient's requests.  Relationship with euthanasia  In many cases, particularly countries in which voluntary euthanasia is illegal, physicians must exercise medical paternalism by not respecting patients' wishes to die. There are contrasting views on whether this constitutes weak or strong paternalism. One argument is that weak paternalism allows the physician to stay completely hands-off. If the patient is in a sound state of mind and the doctor can reasonably guess what they desire, so there is no need for further action. They do not need to keep the patient alive, nor do they need to allow the patient to die. In this sense, one could argue that weak medical paternalism has no contradictions with allowing a patient to undergo voluntary euthanasia. The relationship between strong medical paternalism and euthanasia is slightly more complicated. There are questions of a philosophical nature that must be addressed. For example, a strong paternalist would have to determine whether it is always objectively bad for a human to die, even if that human could prove that it was their desire to do so. In these cases, a physician may defer to morality or religion in order to make a decision. They would perhaps present the argument that even if a person wished to die, it would be an irrational desire and they should not indulge it. However, in the absence of these factors, it is possible for strong paternalism to be compatible with voluntary euthanasia. This would require the patient to make it clear that he or she would not be losing anything of value to them by dying, i.e. fundamentally disconnecting life from goodness. For example, if a patient learns that he or she would be in constant pain for the rest of his or her life, it is not irrational to honor their wishes to die. In these cases, some argue, even a strong paternalism does not justify prolonging the patient's life, because the physicians actions would not truly be for the patient's own good.

The company has created PlaceSpeak, a location-based civic engagement platform designed to consult with people within specific geographic boundaries. Since its inception, PlaceSpeak has been developed with the support of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC-IRAP). Its suite of feedback collection tools and features was designed with the International Association of Public Participation (IAP2) Spectrum of Public Participation in mind. PlaceSpeak has been used by public and private sector organizations to consult with the public on community plans, parks and recreation, public transit, public health, budgets, and more. As of late, it has supported the emergence of Smart Cities across the world with citizen engagement tools for real time development. History PlaceSpeak was founded by Colleen Hardwick in 2010. The idea came to her while looking at a Google Map of Vancouver‚Äôs Arbutus Corridor, and she posed a question about how to best consult with residents based on where they live. She thought that a tool was needed to provide a platform for government, decision makers and developers of public policy ‚Äúto demonstrate honesty‚Ä¶and authenticity in their desire to respond to the will of the people‚Äù. Traditional forms of civic engagement, such as public meetings, often have low attendance with very selective participation; PlaceSpeak initially began as a way to supplement and enhance traditional forms of consultation. Hardwick developed the platform as a way to advance public participation. The PlaceSpeak platform was designed to enable open and transparent engagement by connecting people to local issues. By connecting users' digital identity to their physical location, PlaceSpeak keeps them notified of new and relevant public consultations in their communities, creating opportunities for dialogue between citizens and local government. The ability for proponents and participants to engage with each other reflects PlaceSpeak‚Äôs two-sided market. Proponents register their organization with PlaceSpeak and set up a topic to consult with the public. Geo-verified users can respond to surveys, polls, discussion forums and participatory maps, providing insight into how residents in a specific area feel about a particular issue. Technology PlaceSpeak is a cloud-based public participation platform that generates Geo-spatial feedback data, closely related to a form of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). It is an e-consultation toolkit that allows proponents to connect with and geo- authenticate citizen users based on their location. It uses a 3-step digital identification process to authenticate a user‚Äôs residential address. PlaceSpeak is based on a web application framework which enables GIS scaling and has a built in archiving structure. It has an Application Programming Interface that enables integration with third party applications, such as Facebook and Twitter.  Neighborhoods  In 2015, PlaceSpeak launched Neighborhoods, a private civic network that allows users to connect with people who live in their neighborhood. Neighborhoods pools together geo- verified users who live in the same neighborhood, providing key features like a community noticeboard and an events calendar once logged in. Any communication between registered residents is kept private.

She took the name of \\"Teresa Maria of the Cross\\" when she became a Carmelite nun. She was beatified in 1986 after the recognition of a miracle attributed to her. Life Teresa Maria Manetti was born on 3 March 1846 in Campi Bisenzio as the daughter of Salvatore Manetti and Rosa Bigagli. Her brother was Adamo Raffaello. Manetti lived her life in a small village outside of Florence and her father died when she was three. She made her First Communion on 8 May 1859. At the age of eighteen - at the time that she suddenly realized what her vocation was - she gathered a group of women who were all teachers; the group soon became exposed to the writings of Saint Teresa of Avila and soon enough a devotion to her grew. On 16 July 1876 she joined a group of Carmelite tertiaries and assumed the name of \\"Teresa Maria of the Cross\\"; she became a member of the Discalced Carmelites on 12 July 1888. Following this, Manetti started to establish schools in cities surrounding Florence, each with its own Carmelite teachers. The institution that she founded received papal approval from Pope Pius X on 27 February 1904 as the Carmelite Sisters of Saint Teresa. Their mission was to teach children, with an emphasis on orphans. Houses eventually opened in Syria and Palestine after the approval was granted. Manetti contracted a grave illness in 1908 which intensified until she died on 23 April 1910. Her remains were relocated on 22 April 1912. Beatification The cause for beatification commenced in Florence in the 1930s despite the formal opening of the cause under Pope Pius XII on 30 July 1944. Pope Paul VI approved the findings of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and approved the fact that she had lived a life of heroic virtue. As a result, on 23 May 1975, he declared her to be Venerable. Pope John Paul II approved a miracle attributed to her intercession on 16 November 1985 and beatified her on 19 October 1986.

He worked as creative director for the Spanish fashion label Armand Basi. His work was first published in the 1960s. His cartoons were used in the publications of the political opposition to Francisco Franco. In these publications, Juste de Nin signed his work, \\"El Zurdo\\". For many years, he was engaged in creating illustrations for articles by Manuel V√°zquez Montalb√°n in Mundo Obrero. Career After the restoration of the Generalitat de Catalunya and ratification of the Spanish constitution of 1978, Juste de Nin was commissioned by the new Catalan Government to create a drawn character that, along with the texts of \\"T√≠sner\\", would form the basis of a campaign to normalise the Catalan language. The character he drew was La Norma. Through the 1980s, Juste de Nin contributed with a weekly page to the periodical magazine, Canig√≥ in a series called Petant la xerrada which illustrated contemporary Catalan life. He signed these drawings, L‚ÄôEsquerr√†. In 2006, Juste de Nin was commissioned to design the float for the \\"Three Kings Parade\\". The parade was dedicated to a \\"Year of the Book\\". On his float, a jubilant Don Quixote and Sancho stood surrounded by children holding giant crayons. The characters rode on a large book illustrated with Rocinante‚Äôs head. Juste de Nin was the costume designer for the September 2008 world premiere of the opera, La Celestina at the Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid. He was also a member of the Cercle Catalanista de l'Ateneu Barcelon√®s, of the Foundation Andreu Nin; a partner at √ímnium Cultural; and member of the Patronat of the National Museum of Art in Catalonia.

While best known as a leading Lamprey specialist, Cochran published hundreds of articles in refereed and non-refereed publications, as well as numerous book chapters, book reviews, and notes. He conducted much of his fieldwork in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and his research focused on a wide variety of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles of the upper Midwest. With John Lyons and Don Fago, Cochran coauthored the book Wisconsin Fishes 2000: Status and Distribution, which provided an updated overview of the status and abundance of fishes in Wisconsin. In 1991, during a sabbatical, he journeyed to central Mexico to help carry out the first comprehensive studies of the distribution, status, morphology, and ecology of the threatened non-parasitic Jacona lamprey and the endangered parasitic Chapala lamprey.

History Some Jewish conversos arrived at the time of the Spanish Conquest in Peru. Then, only Christians were allowed to take part in expeditions to the New World. At first, they had lived without restrictions because the Inquisition was not active in Peru (at the beginning of the Viceroyalty). Then, with the advent of the Inquisition, 'New Christians' began to be persecuted, and, in some cases, executed. In this period, these people were sometimes called \\"marranos\\" (\\"pigs\\"), converts (\\"conversos\\"), and \\"cristianos nuevos\\" (New Christians) even if they had been reared as Catholics from birth. To escape persecution, these colonial Sephardi Jews conversos settled mainly in the northern highlands and northern high jungle. They intermarried with natives and non-Jewish Europeans (mainly Spanish and Portuguese people) in some areas, assimilating to the local people: in Cajamarca, the northern highlands of Piura (Ayabaca and Huancabamba), among others, due to cultural and ethnic contact with people of the southern highlands of Ecuador. Their mixed-race descendants were reared with syncretic Catholic, Jewish, European and Andean rituals and beliefs. In the first decades of the 19th century, many Sephardi Jews from Morocco emigrated to Peru as traders and trappers, working with the natives of the interior. By the end of the century, the rubber boom in the Amazon Basin attracted even greater numbers of Sephardi Jews from North Africa, as well as Europeans. Many settled in Iquitos, which was the Peruvian center for the export of rubber along the Amazon River. They created the second organized Jewish community in Peru after Lima, founding a Jewish cemetery and synagogue. After the boom fizzled due to competition from Southeast Asia, many European and North African Jews left Iquitos. Those who remained over generations have eventually married native women; their mixed-race or mestizo descendants grew up in the local culture, a mixture of Jewish and Amazonian influences and faiths. In modern times, before and after the Second World War, some Ashkenazi Jews, chiefly from Western and Eastern Slavic areas and from Hungary, migrated to Peru, chiefly to the capital Lima. The Ashkenazis ignored the Peruvian Jews of the Amazon, excluding them from consideration as fellow Jews under their Orthodox law because their maternal lines were not Jewish. In the late 20th century, some descendants in Iquitos began to study Judaism, eventually making formal conversions in 2002 and 2004 with the aid of a sympathetic American rabbi from Brooklyn, New York. A few hundred were given permission to make aliyah to Israel. In 2014, nearly 150 more emigrated to Israel. Today Today, there are about 3,000 Jews in Peru, with only two organized communities: Lima and Iquitos.Ariel Segal Freilich, Jews of the Amazon: Self-exile in Earthly Paradise, Jewish Publication Society, 1999, pp. 1-5 They have made strong contributions to the economics and politics of Peru; the majority in Lima (and the country) are Ashkenazi Jews. Some have held notable posts: * Salom√≥n Lerner Ghitis served as Prime Minister of Peru in 2011, during Ollanta Humala's presidency. * Efra√≠n Goldenberg served as Prime Minister (1994-1995), Foreign Minister (1993-1995), and Finance Minister (1999-2000) in the government of Alberto Fujimori. * French-born anthropologist Eliane Karp was First Lady of Peru. * Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, former President of Peru. * Salomon Libman, footballer. * Yehude Simon served as Prime Minister of Peru from 2008 till 2009, during Alan Garc√≠a's second presidency. * David Waisman was Second Vice President of Peru in Alejandro Toledo's government, from 2001 until 2006.

After being published by episodes on L'Illustrazione Italiana, in the period January 13‚Äì27, 1913, it was released as a volume by editor Fratelli Treves in Milan. It's considered the most notable work written by Deledda. The title of the book is an allusion to human frailty and sorrow, which was already found in Elias Portolu, written in 1900: Uomini siamo, Elias, uomini fragili come canne, pensaci bene. Al di sopra di noi c'√® una forza che non possiamo vincere. (¬´We are human, Elias, as frail as reeds: think carefully. There's a force we can't defeat above us.¬ª) About the work Set in the barren lands of Sardinia, the novel involves the themes of poverty, honor and superstition. Early 20th Century rural Sardinia described in the book is still nowadays a combination of an apparently static society, related to millenary customs, and a land striding towards a both industrial and technological progress. Unlike other artists of that time, discussing the most complex side of this progress (that is, how that modernity represented the human essence in every place, not only Western countries), Deledda was much more sensitive and concerned about its cultural side, grasping the deep and upsetting meaning of this change. We can see this in her projection of the island community. It is not a story for its own sake, neither is it enclosed within the Sardinian borders. What was valid for the island was also for Italy at the time, and the world. An English translation of this work by Martha King was published in 2008 by Italica Press. Plot A Sardinian village called Galte, not far from the mouth of the Cedrino river (on the Tyrrhenian coast), is home to the noble family Pintor (a father and a mother with four daughters); Don Zame, the head of the family, is described as red and violent as the devil: he's a proud and arrogant man, jealous of the house's honor in the village. His wife and daughters, devoted to housework, are never allowed to go out. The only rebel to their condition is Lia, Don Zame's third child, who flees to the Italian peninsula against her father's rule, reaching Civitavecchia. There, she gets married and has a son, but unfortunately she dies. Don Zame appears to go mad for the scandal. \\"A shade of death encumbered the house: no comparable scandal had ever rose before; it had never happened that such a noble and polite maiden like Lia had run away like that\\". Eventually, her father is mysteriously found dead on the bridge at the entrance of the village. Was it a misfortune or a murder? The above events are the background to the story, revealed throughout the novel from the point in which Giacinto, Lia's son, comes to the Pintor house. The narration begins years later, when the no longer young Pintor ladies (Ruth, Ester and Noemi) live in a by then crumbling house and are still the owners of a small estate, barely sufficient to their maintenance. Their existences pass in a mournful sadness that is overthrowing their pride and amour propre, sometimes seen in Noemi's behavior but very seldom in her elder sisters', who are worn out because of misery. Their servant Efix (from Ephysius, the name of the patron saint of Cagliari) is attached to them by a strong guilt trip (in effect, he had killed Don Zame to help Lia, for whom he had a feeling really similar to love). He dreams one day the house of Pintor will flourish again. His hope is kindled by the arrival of Giacinto, which arouses very different emotions among the people of the village. Finally love establishes a new balance of things. In popular culture In 1958, a TV series was produced by RAI for Italian broadcast.

Dafydd is widely seen as the greatest of the Welsh poets, and this is one of his best-known works. The poem cannot be precisely dated, but was perhaps written in the 1340s. Summary Dafydd curses the women of his parish, and complains that he has never had any luck with any of them. He wonders what is lacking in him or in them that none of them will agree to meet him in the woods. Comparing himself to Garwy he says that he has always been in love with some girl or other but never won her, and confesses that every Sunday he can be found in church, with his head turned over his shoulder and away from the body of Christ, gazing at some girl. Dafydd represents such a woman as exchanging with her friend gibes about his appearance and character. The poet concludes that he must give all this up and go off alone to be a hermit, since, though his ogling habits have literally turned his head, he still has no girl. Commentary Dafydd often refers to Llanbadarn in his poems, reflecting the fact that he was born at Brogynin, in the parish of Llanbadarn Fawr, and lived there for many years. He shows his knowledge of Welsh legend with his reference to Garwy Hir, who was renowned as a lover, and whose daughter was herself loved by King Arthur. The line in which the poet is said to be \\"Pale and with his sister's hair\\" are consistent with a third-hand description of Dafydd given in a 16th-century document: \\"tall and slender, with long curly yellow hair, full of silver clasps and rings\\". It has been suggested that the first of Dafydd's two disparagers is the woman whom in many other poems he calls Morfudd, the object of his often rejected devotion. Theme and analogues The first few lines of the poem in Peniarth MS 54, a manuscript dating from c. 1480. The poem's theme, Dafydd's habitual failure in love, is a very common one in his work. As the novelist and scholar Gwyn Jones wrote: > No lover in any language, and certainly no poet, has confessed to missing > the mark more often than Dafydd ap Gwilym. Uncooperative husbands, quick- > triggered alarms, crones and walls, strong locks, floods and fogs and bogs > and dogs are for ever interposing themselves between him and golden-haired > Morfudd, black-browed Dyddgu, or Gwen the infinitely fair. But a great > trier, even in church. Parallels to Dafydd's amused and ironic reportage of his own inadequacies can be found in Chaucer's works, and elsewhere in medieval literature; also in the poems of Dafydd's avowed model Ovid. But Dafydd is also, more seriously, pointing up the superficiality of the girls' criticism of his appearance as compared with an implied judgement of his true worth. Poetic art In common with other Middle Welsh poems of the form called cywyddau \\"The Girls of Llanbadarn\\" follows complex rules of construction. It uses the system of alliteration and internal rhyme known as cynghanedd, except in the lines recording the comments of the two girls, where, in contrast with the rest of the poem, the diction is plain and conversational. Sangiad, the breaking-up of the syntactical structure of the sentence, is used in most of the poem. The scholar Joseph Clancy illustrated this with a literal translation of the last lines, in which the second half of each line interrupts the narrative flow with the poet's commentary on it: > From too much looking, strange lesson, > Backwards, sight of weakness, > It happened to me, strong song's friend, > To bow my head without one companion.  Influence  The 20th-century Welsh poet Raymond Garlick wrote a poem, \\"Llanbadarn Etc.\\", inspired by \\"The Girls of Llanbadarn\\" and addressed to a contemporary who, though displaying behaviour similar to that depicted in Dafydd ap Gwilym's poem, has > no words now to crown it with > or turn it to a cywydd.

Wheatley Wagstaff in Cardiff City Hall. \\"The Seagull\\" (Welsh: Yr Wylan) is a love poem in 30 lines by the 14th-century Welsh poet Dafydd ap Gwilym, probably written in or around the 1340s. Dafydd is widely seen as the greatest of the Welsh poets, and this is one of his best-known and best-loved works. Summary The poet addresses and praises a seagull flying over the waves, comparing it to, among other things, a gauntlet, a ship at anchor, a sea-lily, and a nun. He asks it to find a girl whom he compares to Eigr and who can be found on the ramparts of a castle, to intercede with her, and to tell her that the poet cannot live without her. He loves her for her beauty more than Myrddin or Taliesin ever loved, and unless he wins kind words from her he will die. Imagery The poem in BL Add. MS 14997, a manuscript dating from c. 1500. The academic critic Huw Meirion Edwards considered that \\"The Seagull\\"‚Äôs imagery goes far beyond anything that had come before it in Welsh poetry, and Anthony Conran wrote that \\"pictorially it is superb‚Ä¶[it] has the visual completeness, brilliance and unity of a medieval illumination, a picture from a book of hours\\". Dafydd wrote several love-messenger poems, and is indeed considered the master of that form. They follow an established pattern, beginning by addressing the llatai, or messenger, going on to describe it in terms of praise, then asking the llatai to take the poet's message to his lover, and finally in general adding a prayer that the messenger return safely. But in \\"The Seagull\\", as with Dafydd's other bird-poems, the gull is more than just a conventional llatai: the bird's appearance and behaviour are observed closely, while at the same time Dafydd shows, according to the scholar Rachel Bromwich, \\"an almost mystical reverence\\" for it. The image of the seagull's beautiful, white, immaculate purity suggests that of the girl, while the bird's flight embodies the idea of freedom, in contrast with the dominating and enclosing castle. This castle has not been positively identified, although Aberystwyth and Criccieth have both been suggested. The girl herself is unusual in two respects, firstly in the paucity of physical detail in Dafydd's description of her as compared with the women in his other love poems, and secondly in that she is a redhead, as very few women in medieval Welsh poetry are. Poetic art The seagull is described in what has been called \\"a guessing game technique\\" or \\"riddling\\", a technique known in Welsh as dyfalu comprising the stringing together of imaginative and hyperbolic similes and metaphors. Dafydd also uses devices for breaking up syntax known as sangiad and tor ymadrodd. So, for example: The translator Idris Bell explained the sense of this as \\"Have the kindness in courteous wise to give her the message that I shall die unless she will be mine.\\" References to older poetry Eigr, with whom Dafydd compares his beloved, was in Welsh tradition the wife of Uther Pendragon and mother of King Arthur. She is the heroine he most often cites as the archetypical beautiful woman. The legendary figures of Myrddin and Taliesin are often invoked together in Welsh verse, and in some early poems Myrddin is presented as a lover, though Taliesin was not, making Dafydd's mention of him in this role rather odd. It has been argued that these two figures are introduced as a tribute to one of the wellsprings of Dafydd's work, the native Welsh poetic tradition, while on the other hand the terms in which he describes his submission to the girl acknowledge one of the other great influences on him, the literature of courtly love, stemming from Provence but by Dafydd's time to be found across Europe. Adaptations * Glyn Jones wrote a poem, \\"Dafydd's Seagull and the West Wind\\", which gives the seagull's response. * John Hardy set \\"The Seagull\\" as part of a song-cycle called Fflamau Oer: Songs for Jeremy. * Robert Spearing set the poem, together with some lines from Romeo and Juliet, in his cantata for tenor and piano She Solus.

When everyone is asleep he makes his move, but stumbles over a stool in the darkness, and in getting up knocks over a table from which a brass bowl falls. The noise of all this, and of the dogs who have started barking, awakens three English tinkers called Hickin, Jenkin and Jack. They raise the alarm, believing that some Welsh thief is after their belongings. The ostler rouses the other guests, but the poet, hunted for on all hands, manages with the help of fervent prayer to reach his own bed undiscovered. He ends by asking God's forgiveness. Setting Several allusions in the poem demonstrate Dafydd's close personal knowledge of tavern life and tavern drinks. Since such taverns were especially common in the Norman settlements in Wales it may be that the poem is set in such a town. It is widely conjectured that the town in the poem is Newborough, Anglesey, a borough established by the Crown to house the inhabitants of Llanfaes, who had been cleared from their village to facilitate the building of Beaumaris Castle. Dafydd must certainly known Newborough, since he wrote a poem in its praise. Style \\"Trouble at a Tavern\\" is written in an jerky, excited, abrupt style, and is characterised by the use of interjections and sangiadau, or words introduced in unsyntactical places. This technique is much used in the stricter Welsh metres and is well suited to a narrative poem full of incident, tending to point up the comic anarchy of the action. The poem is full of innuendo, allowing more than one reading of its words. Themes and influences The theme of the poet's misadventures in love is a very common one in Dafydd's work. As the novelist and scholar Gwyn Jones wrote: > No lover in any language, and certainly no poet, has confessed to missing > the mark more often than Dafydd ap Gwilym. Uncooperative husbands, quick- > triggered alarms, crones and walls, strong locks, floods and fogs and bogs > and dogs are for ever interposing themselves between him and golden-haired > Morfudd, black-browed Dyddgu, or Gwen the infinitely fair. \\"Trouble at a Tavern\\"'s similarity to other poems by Dafydd with this same theme has enabled modern editors to attribute the poem securely to him, in spite of the fact that it survives in no manuscript from earlier than the late 16th century. The poem's mockery also extends to the English interlopers in Wales, and at least one reader has complained of its racial prejudice on that account. But the critic Tony Conran sees \\"Trouble at a Tavern\\" as being not just a comic romp but a poem shot through with multiple layers of irony, most notably in its hints that the Welsh hero is playing at being an Anglo-Norman lordling, and therefore getting a justified comeuppance. He also sees the possibility in the poem's final pious words of an ironic irreverence towards God himself. But perhaps it is simply a warning to impetuous young men not to be so foolish. Dafydd may have derived the theme of sexual comedy from the fabliaux, rollicking tales in verse of a type which originated in France and spread across Europe, though he differs from them in making the poet himself the butt of the story. In that case there would be little or no reason to suppose the poem autobiographical. Alternatively, he could have been influenced in this respect by the works of Ovid, of Chaucer, or of the goliards. It has also been argued that the poem was based on the form of medieval morality tale known as exemplum, or that it was intended as a parody of the chivalric romance in which the narrator's humiliation is a judgement on his uncourtly attitude to love.

He played college football at Boise State. He went undrafted in the 2015 NFL Draft. Early years Renaud attended De La Salle High School in Concord, California, where he was a three-year varsity letterwinner who was voted first-team All-East Bay Athletic League as a junior and senior at linebacker, as well as second-team all-league as a sophomore. He was selected to the CalHi Sports All-State Sophomore Team in 2008. As a junior, he was named first-team All-EBAL and first-team All-Bay Area by the San Francisco Chronicle. He was also named to the MaxPreps Junior Class All- America Second Team in 2009 and was voted East Bay Defensive Player of the Year by the Contra Costa Times. He served as team captain during his senior season in 2011 and was named to the CalHi Sports All-State Seniors First Team. College career Freshman Season Renaud would begin at Boise State University in 2011. He would redshirt to begin the season but would lose his redshirt status playing on special teams in the season opener against #22 Georgia. In a week 8 matchup against Air Force he would have a season-high 3 tackles. Again, the next game, he would match his season-high in tackles against UNLV. On November 11 he would force a fumble against San Diego State. Renaud would finish his freshman season with 10 tackles, 5 solo, and a forced fumble. Sophomore Season Coming into 2012, Renaud's role with the broncos would expand. He would be placed in the linebacker rotation and against UNLV he would post a career-high 10 tackles. He would finish his season sixth on the team with 46 tackles, and 26 solo tackles. Junior Season After returning in 2013, Renaud would finally get his first career start. He would start the season opener against Washington and finish the game with 7 tackles and a tackle for loss. He would continue to start the first six games until an injury would sideline him for the next three games. After returning, he would finish the season with only 25 tackles, with 12 being solo tackles. Senior Season After only starting 6 games the previous season due to injury, Renaud would come back for his senior year. In a week 3 matchup with UConn, he would amass a team-high 9 tackles, and 2.5 tackles for loss. The next game he would rack up 5 tackles and his first sack of the season in Boise State's third straight win against Louisiana-Lafayette. On September 27, he would have another 5 tackles and 1.5 tackles for loss against the Air Force. In week 11, he would have 4 tackles and a sack against San Diego State. Renaud would have 2 tackles in his last collegiate game against #10 Arizona in the Fiesta Bowl. He would finish his last year with 39 tackles(20 solo), 6.5 tackles for loss, and 2 sacks in 10 starts and 13 games. Renaud would finish his collegiate career with a total of 120 tackles, 63 solo, 8 tackles for loss, 2 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery in 46 career games. He would earn 3 varsity letters and graduate with a diploma in communications. Professional career Without any eligibility left Renaud's only choice was to declare himself for the draft although he was highly unlikely to be drafted as a linebacker. Since he wasn't a highly touted prospect coming out of college, he wasn't invited to perform at the NFL scouting combine.

It is a member of the S&P; 500, and is credited as being the world's first and largest accounting and finance staffing firm, with over 345 locations worldwide. Robert Half has a variety of divisions. The Company operates through three segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing, and risk consulting and internal audit services. Through its Accountemps, Robert Half Finance & Accounting, Robert Half Management Resources divisions, it provides temporary, full-time and project professionals in the fields of accounting and finance. Other divisions include Robert Half Technology, providing software, application, IT infrastructure and operations professionals, OfficeTeam, which specializes in administrative and customer service staffing, The Creative Group, that focuses on design, artistic, and creative talent, and Robert Half Legal that offer flexible and direct-hire staffing for legal professionals. In 2002, Protiviti Inc. was founded as a subsidiary of Robert Half, which provides internal audit, financial, operations, technology, governance, and risk consulting services. Robert Half is listed by Fortune magazine as among the \\"World's Most Admired Companies\\" in the temporary-help industry for 21 years consecutively (as of 2019) since it first made the list in 1998. History The company's founding was in 1948, in New York City, with its original name being variously reported as being Robert Half Inc., Robert Half Finance & Accounting, and Robert Half Personnel Agency. The founding, in any case, is reported to have been of two separate business entities, the Robert Half (RH) portion as \\"an employment agency for accountants,\\" and the Accountemps portion \\"to supply accountants and other financial professionals‚Ä¶ on a temporary basis.\\" Founder Robert Half had previously managed the hiring of accounting staff for a sizeable textile manufacturing concern, and saw an opportunity as no placement agency had been focusing on this sector of the market. In the mid- to late-1980s, Robert Half (RH) altered its prior focus‚Äîwhich had been like that of the field in general‚Äîfrom relatively undifferentiated temporary clerical and light industry staffing, to providing temporary workers at higher skill levels via new \\"professional staffing divisions\\". Having grown to over 150 locations in the United States and launched an aggressive campaign to re-purchase many of the separate franchises, the firm went public in 1987, then expanded its operations into Europe in 1993. This information is derived from the following source: Note, this compilation reports, to a significant degree, information self-reported by the company, and so constitutes information not strictly third-party in nature. In addition to their Accountemps brand, the firm expanded to include specialty groups focusing on technology, legal and creative services personnel. Inroads into the legal sector began with the company's 1991 acquisition of \\"The Affiliates, a firm in Southern California that placed temporary and permanent paralegal, legal administrative, and other legal support personnel,\\" with it being renamed as Robert Half Legal. Robert Half went on to establish itself as a key information provider for government agencies and others seeking statistics and trends regarding employment, with its market-specific salary guides being used as a resource by the U.S Department of Labor in the preparation of their own forecasts. In addition to their main staffing line of business, RH also provides independent risk consulting, internal audit and information technology consulting services via its Protiviti subsidiary, which was founded in 2002 with the acquisition of former employees of Arthur Andersen. Since then, the group has grown from 700 to over 2,900 staff, and continues to be led by Andersen alumni. In 2003, the company was finally able to buy back the last of the few remaining independent franchise operations. In 2006, RH (through subsidiary Proviti Inc.) acquired the assets of PG Lewis & Associates, a leading national provider of Data Forensics and Cyber Security services founded in 2003 by serial technology entrepreneur, Paul G. Lewis. Financial terms were not disclosed. Published works Founder Robert Half's tradition of authoring books on the industry‚Äîsuch as Making It Big in Data Processing and How to Get a Better Job in This Crazy World‚Äîwas continued by the CEO of this date, Harold M. \\"Max\\" Messmer, in the form of works like Job Hunting for Dummies.

The greater part of her youth was spent in Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ and Napajedla, where in 1896 she married a railway clerk named Josef Bene≈°. In 1908 she and her husband moved to Prague. Life Bene≈°ov√° and her husband divorced in 1912 but continued living together until his death in 1933. Her friendship with the writer R≈Ø≈æena Svobodov√°, whom she met in 1902 in Fren≈°t√°t pod Radho≈°tƒõm, had a tremendous influence on her life. Svobodov√° helped Bene≈°ov√° to overcome a resigned melancholia after the wedding and supported her as a writer. The friends corresponded prolifically, Svobodov√° visited Bene≈°ov√° in Moravia, and they traveled together to Italy (e.g., in 1903 and in 1907). Their friendship lasted until Svobodov√°'s death in 1920. Svobodov√° had had the effect of a disciplinarian on Bene≈°ov√° (as she had earlier had on actress/writer Hana Kvapilov√°), overseeing that she read and write daily and compelling her to finish her manuscripts. Svobodov√° introduced Bene≈°ov√° to Franti≈°ek Xaver ≈†alda, a Francophilic Czech literary critic who would have profound national influence during the interwar period and who is now viewed as the founder of modern Czech criticism. According to Marcel Cornis-Pope and John Neubauer, \\"The novelist Marie Pujmanov√°, who was a fairly close friend of Bene≈°ov√°'s after the Great War, relates that young Bene≈°ov√° had enthusiastically read Dostoyevsky and Maupassant, but that, under the guidance of F. X. ≈†alda, she came to admire Flaubert even more.\\"Cornis-Pope, M., & Neubauer, J., History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and Disjunctures in the 19th and 20th Centuries (Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2004), p. 354. On their second trip to Italy, in 1907, they were accompanied by the renowned Czech poet, essayist, leader of the Realist movement and master of colloquial Czech Josef Svatopluk Machar. In 1907 and 1908 Benesova edited the supplement \\"Woman in Arts\\" in the newspaper Female Revue (\\"a resource for women's issues, ethnicity, culture and society\\"). This experience opened doors to future collaborations with other magazines, e.g., Masaryk's New Era. At this point in 1908 the family resolved to move from Moravia to Prague. During the war years, 1914‚Äì18, Bene≈°ov√° completed two books of short stories, Mice and Cruel Youth, and set to work on her largest literary work, the two-part novel A Human Being. In 1926 she commenced work as a secretary and librarian at the German YWCA where she eventually headed a summer camp, the starting point of her financial security. Bene≈°ov√° was very popular with the young women at YWCA, who formed an inner group called the \\"Bo≈æena Bene≈°ov√° girls.\\" (A decade later, when she was gravely ill, it was to these same Bo≈æena Bene≈°ov√° girls that she dictated the final chapter of her final work Don Pablo, Don Pedro and Vƒõra Luk√°≈°ov√°.) From 1932 onward Bene≈°ov√° was a regular member of the Czech Academy of Arts and Sciences.Members of the Czech Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1890‚Äì1952, p. 39. She died on April 8, 1936 in her Prague-Bubeneƒç home and is interred beside her companion / erstwhile husband Josef Bene≈° at the neighborhood cemetery H≈ôbitovn√≠ spr√°va Bubeneƒç. During the remainder of the 1930s the feverishly inventive polymath Emil Franti≈°ek Burian, a well-known exponent of the Devƒõtsil (or Svaz modern√≠ kultury Devƒõtsil) Czech avant-garde association in the 1920s, produced and directed a film adaptation of Bene≈°ov√°'s swansong novel, which premiered as Vera Luk√°≈°ov√° in 1939, starring Ji≈ôina Str√°nsk√° in the title role.Reittererova, V., \\"E.

It is classified as a historical monument. Building history The museum is housed in the former palace of the Bishop of Beauvais, who was also the Count of Beauvais and a peer of France. The original palace was built on a Roman wall below the Beauvais Cathedral by Henry of France (‚Äì75), son of King Louis VI of France and Bishop of Beauvais from 1149 to 1161. Following a riot in the 14th century the bishop built a fortified entrance guarded by two towers. In the 16th century Bishop Louis Villiers de l‚ÄôIsle Adam (1497‚Äì1521) rebuilt the palace in Renaissance style with Gothic decoration. The clock tower in the facade holds a stairway leading up to a belfry with three bells, one of them made in 1506. After the French Revolution the palace was made the seat of the prefecture in 1800, then returned to the bishopric in 1822. In 1846 it became a courthouse. In 1848 Prosper M√©rim√©e had the building placed on the list of historical monuments. The court moved out of the building in 1973, and renovations were made between 1974 and 1981, when the museum opened. The building began to show structural problems caused by the many visitors, and was closed to the public in 1997. Temporary exhibitions were given in the structurally sound sections of the building. A renovation project was started in 2013 and the museum reopened in January 2015. The renovation cost over ‚Ç¨9.5 million, supported by the Oise Department in partnership with the Picardy Region.

At first the collection was stored in various municipal offices, but it steadily outgrew the available space. In 1908 the city of Beauvais and the Soci√©t√© acad√©mique de l'Oise offered the collection to the departmental council of the Oise. In 1909 the department acquired a large building to the north of the cathedral. The museum was temporarily evacuated in 1918, during World War I (1914‚Äì18). During World War II (1939‚Äì45) most of the objects were destroyed when the museum was bombed in June 1940. In 1960 the remainder of the collection was installed in the attic of the former Bishop's Palace. Present museum Enr√¥lement des volontaires de 1792 by 300px The museum opened after a major renovation on 25 January 2015. In the center of the renovated Bishop's Palace the \\"19th Century Tour\\" leads past works by artists such as Camille Corot, Alfred Sisley, Paul Huet, Prosper Marilhat and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. There are decorative works by Alexis-Joseph Mazerolle and Pierre-Victor Galland, and ceramics by Jules-Claude Ziegler. The huge unfinished canvas Enr√¥lement des volontaires de 1792 by Thomas Couture is displayed in the old courtroom, along with many preparatory sketches.

Capital letters throughout the text have been highlighted in red and yellow.326x326px Jerome's first epistle to Paulinus is the letter number 53 of Jerome, addressed to Paulinus of Nola. It has been used as the preface for the Gutenberg Bible. This Bible was published by Johannes Gutenberg and Johann Fust in Mainz, Germany in 1454. The Gutenberg Bible is an edition of a 4th century Latin translation of the Bible known as the Vulgate or common text. Jerome Jerome was a prominent religious figure ‚Äì a Christian priest, confessor, theologian, historian and Doctor of the Church. He was recognised as a Saint by the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the Church of England and was responsible for a translation of the Bible into Latin: the Vulgate. Many medieval Vulgate manuscripts included Jerome's epistle number 53, to Paulinus bishop of Nola, as a general prologue to the whole Bible. Notably, this letter was printed at the head of the Gutenberg Bible. Jerome's letter promotes the study of each of the books of the Old and New Testaments listed by name (and excluding any mention of the deuterocanonical books); and its dissemination had the effect of propagating the belief that the whole Vulgate text was Jerome's work despite the fact it is not.  Content of the epistle   In the Gutenberg Vulgate  Creation The Gutenberg Bible was created using a pioneering invention that allowed sheets of paper to be printed in large quantities resulting in the same quality as manuscripts. Only 135 copies of the Bible were printed on paper and 45 on vellum. The fact that such a small number of copies were produced, the innovative procedure used to create it and the quality of the result are features that make Gutenberg and Fust authority figures in the book-making process. Additionally, because it was written in Latin, only an elite audience of aristocrats, merchants and some educated priests could understand it.

George Welsh Kellner was born in Calcutta, the son of Francis Daniel Kellner and Anne Henrietta Welsh. He was educated there at Doveton College. Sir George Francis Kellner held various posts in India and later served in Cyprus. In 1884, he was appointed Assistant Paymaster-General in the Court of Chancery. Both he and his brother Edwin were accountants in the service of the East India Company and later in various governmental departments. Sir George married Ann Caroline Gardiner (1830-1872) in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1846. The couple had eight children. His second wife was Jane Carter (1850-1926) of Dublin, Ireland, whom he married in London and with whom he had three children. Some wrongly believe that Kellner and his brother Edwin Welsh Kellner had the franchise (\\"G. F. Kellner, and Co\\") for running European-style restaurants at the major railway stations in India. This misinformation is even included in books. However, this is not true. The confusion probably arose because the man who founded the company that had the railway franchise, George Ferdinand Kellner (G. F. Kellner), shared initials and a surname with Sir George Francis Kellner (G. F. Kellner). Moreover, the two men were contemporaries and both lived and worked in Calcutta, but were not related.

After the war, Polk moved to Italy with her mother and her siblings. Her family later became friends with King Humbert I. She took to fox-hunting in the Roman Campagna of Italy, where she won a fox-hunt among forty female riders. She also participated in fox hunting in the English countryside.

The landscape is centered on the plant built by the Norsk Hydro company to produce calcium nitrate fertilizer from atmospheric nitrogen using the Birkeland‚ÄìEyde process. The complex also includes hydroelectric power plants, railways, transmission lines, factories, and workers' accommodation and social institutions in the towns of Notodden and Rjukan. This site, along with the Odda‚ÄìTyssedal Industrial Heritage Site, was placed on the tentative World Heritage list on 19 June 2009. On 5 July 2015, it was placed on the World Heritage list under Criteria II and IV with the following description of the Outstanding Universal Value: Scope The Rjukan‚ÄìNotodden site stretches from M√∏svatn lake to Notodden, encompassing 97 discrete structures considered to be culturally significant. Notable examples of such structures are the Rjukan Line and the Tinnoset Line, two railways with corresponding train ferries. Factory towns built by Tinfos and Norsk Hydro, including homes and other town buildings. History  The Birkeland‚ÄìEyde process  In the early 1900s, Norway was able to leverage the geographical availability of cheap hydroelectric power to begin industrial development. The sparsely-populated Telemark region made the transition from a primarily agricultural zone to a center of industry, which required strong industrial development. In order to support agricultural expansion, Norway required large quantities of fertilizer. The common solution was sodium nitrate, which was extracted through mining. The main industrial component of the Rjukan‚ÄìNotodden site is the facilities created for producing fertilizer through nitrogen fixation. The Birkeland-Eyde process, named for scientist Kristian Birkeland (1867-1917) and industry tycoon Sam Eyde (1866-1940), allowed for nitrate intended for fertilizer to be produced on an industrial scale. It used electric arc to create nitric oxide through heat. The process was initially tested at The Royal Frederick University, now named the University of Oslo. = Process development = alt= When the power production capability of The Royal Frederick University proved insufficient, the experiments were moved offsite to a warehouse in Kristiania. In October 1903, the experiments were again moved to Ankerl√∏kken Testing Station in Maridalen, where they could be powered directly by the Hammeren Hydroelectric Power Station. The final relocation of the experimental phase was to Vassmoen, near Arendal, where the first industry-capable arc furnaces were developed. After its completion, the process was presented by Otto Witt at the Technical University of Berlin on 18 November 1905. On 5 December 1905, Kristian Birkeland gave a lecture about the process at the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, while Sam Eyde gave a lecture at the Norwegian Polytechnic Society.  The move to Notodden  alt= After creating an adequate process, Birkeland and Eyde founded the Norsk Hydro-Elektrisk Kv√¶lstofaktieselskab (lit. Norwegian Hydroelectric Nitrogen Share-Company) to commercialize it. This undertaking was partially financed by the Wallenbergs, an influential Swedish family. Norsk Hydro also entered into an agreement with Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A. in 1905. By the time Norsk Hydro secured financing, some of Birkeland's arc furnaces were already present in the Notodden facility, powered by the Tinfos I Hydroelectric Power Station. This station was leased from the company Tinfos AS. The researchers moved the arc furnace at Vassmoen to the Notodden site in order to test the effect of electric power on fertilizer yield. After determining what type of furnace was the best choice for mass production, Eyde's previous company Elkem was placed in control of the factory.  Sv√¶lgfos I and II  Sv√¶lgfos I Hydroelectric Power Station in Notodden, Norway Between 1906 and 1907, preparations were made to expand production, which necessitated more energy. Norsk Hydro was by then able to construct their own power plant at the Svelgfossen waterfall, known as Sv√¶lgfos I. Excess available water flow allowed for the construction of a backup plant, Sv√¶lgfos II. Sv√¶lgfos I was the second-largest hydroelectric power station in the world at the time, following Edward Dean Adams Power Plant at Niagara Falls. In the plant's first few years, plant shutdowns were common due to burnt-out generators. Consequently, electrical engineers with experience working on generators in Paris, Hamburg, and Mexico were consulted. These individuals were some of the only ones in the world who had experience with power plants of comparative size. It was determined that the problems experienced by the Sv√¶lgfos plants were due to insulation materials burning at high temperatures caused by a manufacturing error. A lightning arrester was constructed to remediate this fault. Sv√¶lgfos I and II, along with Lienfoss Power Plant, were later merged into a power plant that is still in service as of May 2020.  Vemork  Turbine Hall at Vemork Power Station, 2018 The Vemork Hydroelectric Power Station was designed by Olaf Nordhagen, influenced by traditional Norwegian architecture. Upon its completion in 1911, it was the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world. Vemork is most famous for its proximity to the events of Operation Gunnerside, in which the nearby hydrogen plant is known as Vannstoffen (lit. Hydrogen) was sabotaged (due to its production of heavy water used in atomic experimentation) by a group of Norwegian partisans who had initially fled Nazi-occupied Norway. Today, the Vemork power plant building houses the Norwegian Industrial Workers Museum, where the hydroelectric generators are still visible.  Role in world fertilizer development  In 1909, Fritz Haber discovered a new process to produce nitrogen-based fertilizer. In cooperation with the German chemical company BASF, Carl Bosch was tasked with implementing this process on a commercial scale. In 1913, Norsk Hydro had an option to license the Haber-Bosch process, but elected not to. Norsk Hydro was approached again in 1920 to use the Haber-Bosch process; this time by the French government, who had gained it as part of a settlement following World War I. Instead, Norsk Hydro attempted to develop a viable alternative to the Haber-Bosch method that would use a lower pressure to produce ammonia. This attempt failed, and the project was mothballed in 1924. Norsk Hydro did eventually switch to the Haber-Bosch process in 1927, in collaboration with IG Farben. The plants were again redirected to the Odda Process in the 1930s.

He commissioned nearly 300 miniature portraits of Gilded Age socialites. Early life Peter Mari√© was born in France in 1826. He was the fourth son in a family of nine children born to John Baptiste Mari√© (d. 1835), a ship merchant who traded with Mexico, and Leontine (n√©e Arnaud) Mari√©, who married in 1811. Among his many siblings was eldest brother, Camille Mari√© (father of Elizabeth La Montagne Pendleton), Joseph Mari√©, the Vicomtesse de Bermingham, and another sister who married Ferdinand Thieriot of Leipzig, whose father had been Chamberlain to the King of Saxony. His maternal grandparents were General Joseph Louis Arnaud, a French planter and from Santo Domingo (now known as Haiti), and his American wife, Mary (n√©e Nicholson) Arnaud. His paternal grandfather was a merchant from Cap Fran√ßais, also in Santo Domingo. His grandfather was assassinated during a native uprising in Santo Domingo, at which point his grandmother brought Peter's mother and two aunts to New York City. His paternal grandfather was ma√Ætre de port (harbour master) in Cap- Francais in the French West Indies who died in 1792 from an accidental drowning. Career Miniature portrait of Antoinette Polk, Baroness de Charette, done by Katherine Arthur Behenna, now kept at the New York Historical Society. Mari√© worked for his father and as a banker until his retirement in 1865 at the end of the American Civil War. Upon his retirement, Mari√©, \\"a man of cultivated tastes who inherited a sufficient fortune to indulge them at a comparatively early age,\\" became a socialite in New York.

More recently, it was exhibited at the New-York Historical Society from November 11, 2011 to September 9, 2012. Personal life According to his obituary in The New York Times, \\"It was the custom for men to marry young in the antebellum days, and Mr. Mari√© was one of the very few bachelors in town, who, although most gallant and most devoted to the fair sex, was content with his own lot, and who lived in a house of his own and entertained as a bachelor host.\\" He hosted many society dinners from his residence at 48 West 19th Street and, later at, 6 East 37th Street in Manhattan and summered in Bar Harbor, Maine and Newport, Rhode Island. He died on January 13, 1903 at his residence, 6 East 37th Street, in Manhattan. His funeral took place at St. Patrick's Cathedral and he was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Woodside, Queens. Mari√©'s estate at the time of his death was valued at $1,568,201. Society life In February 1892, Mari√© was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. He first joined the Union Club of the City of New York, a private members' club in Manhattan, as early as 1854. He subsequently joined the Knickerbocker Club, the Grolier Club, the City Club of New York, the Tuxedo Club, and the Gridiron Club. Additionally, he was a member of the American Geographical Society, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the American Fine Arts Society. He made charitable contributions to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Academy of Design and the American Museum of Natural History. He served as the Vice President of the New York Institute for the Blind. He also donated to Catholic outreach to the poor in New York City, but did not publicize his goodwill.

Mosher‚Äôs years as president were a period of particularly high academic achievement. Hillsdale was widely known as one of the strongest small colleges in the Midwest. Mosher was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Bowdoin College. After serving in a German consulate, he accepted the Hillsdale presidency in September, 1886. He was the first Hillsdale president who was not an ordained minister. His most pressing problem was to keep enlarging the endowment. * Joseph Ward Mauck (1902‚Äì1922) ‚Äì Mauck graduated from Hillsdale in 1875, served six years as president of the University of South Dakota, and became treasurer of the Chicago & Milwaukee Electric Railway. He returned to his alma mater as one of its most beloved presidents in 1902 and served for two decades. Even his business skills, however, could not prevent Hillsdale from facing more and more serious financial problems. * William Gear Spencer (1922‚Äì1932) ‚Äì In contrast to the Mauck years, Hillsdale during the Spencer era was relatively prosperous. Prior to coming to Hillsdale at only 35 years of age, Spencer had already received two degrees from Denison and had taught at Colgate and Franklin. Slayton Arboretum was given to the College in 1922. The Oxford debating team met the home team at Hillsdale College in 1924.

A graduate of Hillsdale, graduate student at Columbia University, and professor of history at the University of Ohio, he became one of the youngest college presidents in the United States. The mood of the college under Willfred Otto Mauck was often gloomy because of harsh financial conditions partially related to the Great Depression. Mauck was forced to cancel all construction projects, and a Detroit newspaper printed the misleading headline, ‚ÄúHillsdale for Sale for $11,000.‚Äù The average faculty member received a salary of less than $2,000 a year. * Harvey L. Turner (1942‚Äì1952) ‚Äì Dr. Turner‚Äôs formal inaugural was the first in Hillsdale‚Äôs history. Financial pressures caused by World War II were severe, and in 1950 Turner gave a gloomy report that the current year would end with a $5,000 deficit, and that the 1950‚Äì1951 fiscal budget would end with an imbalance four times as large. On a more positive note, the Wilbur J. Carr Memorial Library was completed in May 1950. Turner characterized his presidency as a ‚Äúdecade of difficulties and developments.‚Äù * J. Donald Phillips (1952‚Äì1971) ‚Äì Phillips strongly emphasized human relations as the primary characteristic of Hillsdale College. Largely removing the possibility of financial collapse which characterized the Turner years, Phillips oversaw the construction of a number of new campus buildings.

It is sited above the town of Hausach in the county of Ortenaukreis in the German state of Baden- W√ºrttemberg.  History  The original hill castle, recorded for the first time in 1246 as castrum Husen, was probably built here by the dukes of Z√§hringen in the 12th century. It later went into the possession of the counts of Freiburg. In 1303, the castle went to the counts of F√ºrstenberg as a result of the marriage of Verena of Freiburg. Count Henry IV of F√ºrstenberg had the castle extensively remodelled and expanded from 1453 to 1477. A neck ditch and an outer ward guarded the heart of the castle with its palas and bergfried. The castle was the residence of the prince's castellans (Burgv√∂gte). In 1632 it burned down and was rebuilt. In 1643 French-Weimar troops under Jean Baptiste Budes de Gu√©briant destroyed the castle. Later the ruins were incorporated into fortified earthworks or schanzen in order to defend the valley against enemy troops. In 1896 the bergfried was given battlements instead of the tower‚Äôs conical roof. In 1968 the town of Hausach purchased the ruins from the House of F√ºrstenberg. Today, parts of the palas wall, the so- called battery tower and the bergfried survive.

His first screen appearance was in an uncredited role in the 1950 B-feature film, ‚ÄúI Shot Billy the Kid‚Äù, with lead Don 'Red' Barry. Due to his rugged looks, Keymas was cast in ethnic, often Native-American characters, or cow-punching, at times ruthless, cowboys, in countless film/TV westerns. Oddly, likely his most recognizable role was the brief and unrecognizable character as ‚ÄòThe Leader‚Äô in the classic TV The Twilight Zone episode \\"Eye of the Beholder\\", which originally aired November 11, 1960. His freakish ambiguous character was seen throughout the episode on a futuristic big-screen monitor as background sub-plot to the story. In 1969, Keymas played the Ute chief Black Wing in the episode \\"A Key for the Fort\\" of the syndicated television series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Robert Taylor not long before Taylor's own death. In the episode Eliza Stewart Udall, as Miss Ella Stewart, sends the first telegraph message from Arizona and works with her Aunt Cora (Ivalou Redd) to nurse Black Wing back to health. The episode also stars Gregg Palmer as Jacob. It was filmed at Pipe Spring National Monument in Utah. Ella Stewart is an ancestor of the Udall family of southwestern politics. Keymas's ‚ÄòIndian‚Äô roles came in many other popular TV westerns series of the day such as: Daniel Boone, ‚ÄúDeath Valley Days‚Äù, The High Chaparral, Gunsmoke, and Bonanza among many others.

They pair actually toured together in April 1951 in what writer Dan Cooper called, \\"honky tonk's apex, the instant that symbolized the genre's zenith.\\" Williams recorded the song at a session at Castle Studio in Nashville on August 10, 1951.

It is served by air, rail and road services. The railway station is to the east of the town and trains run to Ahmedabad and Mumbai. The town's airport is away and daily flights operate to Mumbai. History Huzoor Palace was constructed in early part of the 20th century by Rana Natwarsinhji, who was the last Maharaja of the Princely State of Porbandar. Tourists are prohibited from visiting the palace, as it is now used by the successors of the Maharaja's family who reside in London. Presently, the palace seems to be in desolate condition with door taken out and brick walls put in place. It is not open to visitors. Architecture The palace was built with a clear European influence, with many wings and a slanting roof. The windows are very large with views of the sea. The various wings of the palace have front and backyards, and arranged so that they present a natural scenic ambiance surrounded by gardens and fountains.

In the 1930s, the Jesuit priest, Father William LeVasseur came up with the idea of a retreat center in her name. Bishop Joseph Raphael John Crimont provided support for its establishment, buying federal land. Thousands of stones were used to construct the chapel and other structures, which were gathered by volunteers. The first mass was held in 1941. In 1945, Bishop Crimont died and was buried at the shrine's crypt. In 1953, Bishop Robert Dermot O'Flanagan started The League of the Little Flower to help make the shrine self-sufficient. The shrine fell into disrepair and stopped holding retreats in the 1960s but underwent renovation under the leadership of Fr. James Manske from 1968‚Äì69. For financial reasons, the shrine was forced to close in 1985 but reopened the following year after 25 locals came together to save the shrine.

Early life Backhouse was born in Suffolk, the son of Rev. Edward Bell Backhouse and Mary Anne Emmeline Walford. He was educated at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate, before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Military career Graduating from Sandhurst, Backhouse was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Suffolk Regiment, a line infantry regiment of the British Army, on 25 February 1914. Two of his fellow graduates were Eric Dorman-Smith and Gerard Bucknall. He was posted to the regiment's 2nd Battalion, then stationed in Curragh, Ireland, as part of the 14th Brigade of Major General Charles Fergusson's 5th Division. Sent to France with his battalion in the opening stages of the First World War in mid-August 1914, he was wounded and captured at the Battle of Le Cateau on 26 August, less than a month after the outbreak of war. He was promoted to captain on 1 January 1917, while still a prisoner of war (POW). Following his release after the end of the war, Backhouse returned to service with the Suffolk Regiment. Between 1927 and 1928 he attended the Staff College, Camberley, and from 1929 to 1932 he was a staff captain in Southern Command. He then served as a brigade major of the 10th Infantry Brigade before becoming Officer commanding (OC), Depot Suffolk Regiment in 1934. Between 1936 and 1938 Backhouse held various positions at the War Office, and from 1938 to 1939 he was Commanding officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion, Suffolk Regiment. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Backhouse became commander of the 54th Infantry Brigade, a newly created second-line Territorial Army unit which formed part of the 18th Infantry Division. After training in the United Kingdom for just over two years, the brigade, along with the rest of the 18th Division, was deployed to British Malaya. Backhouse led the 54th Brigade during the Battle of Singapore and following the British garrison's surrender was taken as a prisoner of war, for the second time in his military career, by the Japanese. He was released from capture at the end of the war and in 1946 he was mentioned in dispatches for his leadership during the fall of Singapore in 1942. On 10 February 1948 Backhouse retired from the regular army with the honorary rank of brigadier. From 1947 to 1957 Backhouse served as the honorary colonel of the Suffolk Regiment, and in 1949 he was made a Deputy Lieutenant for Suffolk. He was made a Vice-Lieutenant for the county in 1965. From 1953 to 1959 Backhouse was chairman of the Suffolk Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Association. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1961 New Year Honours.

It was one of the most unusual warships ever constructed, and still survives in popular naval myth as one of the worst warships ever built. The hull was circular to reduce draught while allowing the ship to carry much more armour and a heavier armament than other ships of the same size. Vitse-admiral Popov played a minor role in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78 and was reclassified as a coast-defence ironclad in 1892. The ship was decommissioned in 1903 and sold for scrap in 1911.  Background  In 1868, the Scottish shipbuilder John Elder published an article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area that needed to be protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and that only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of the normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further broadened Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat- bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.McLaughlin, pp. 111, 117‚Äì18, 123, 125 Popov's design was intended to meet an 1869 requirement to defend the Dnieper-Bug Estuary and the Kerch Strait. The requirement was for very heavily armoured ships of draught and armed with rifled guns, four of which should cost no more than four million rubles. The met all of the requirements except that their armament was not powerful enough, so General- Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich selected Popov's circular design in late December 1869. A model was built with a circular hull and performed well during tests in the Baltic Sea at St. Petersburg in April 1870; when Tsar Alexander II received reports of the trials, he nicknamed the ship a \\"popovka\\", after the designer.McLaughlin, pp. 111, 118 Popov's initial design proved to be too grandiose and had to be scaled down. On 24 October, the Tsar approved his design for a ship in diameter, armed with two 11-inch guns, and protected by of armour. It was estimated to cost 1.94 million rubles per ship and the total cost of the programme, including improvements to the shipyards, would cost 8.5 million rubles. For further testing, the Kambala (Flounder), a circular ship in diameter, was built in 1871. Equipped with two engines of eight nominal horsepower each, her trials during that summer were considered a success.McLaughlin, pp. 111, 114 Vitse-admiral Popov was begun as the second ship of the class, after , but Popov took the opportunity, when construction of the ship was suspended shortly after it began, to massively enlarge the ship to accommodate larger, more powerful guns and heavier armour. The Tsar approved the new design on 25 August 1873 although construction did not resume immediately. He also renamed the ship from Kiev to Vitse-admiral Popov, after her designer,Silverstone, p. 387 on 21 October.McLaughlin, p. 117  Description  Vitse-admiral Popov was not perfectly circular like the earlier ship; she had an overall length of and a beam of . Her hull had a draught of , but her propellers stuck out well below the bottom of the hull to a depth of . The ship displaced nearly 50% more at full load than did Novgorod although her freeboard remained . Like the earlier ship the deck curved upwards to the gun barbette in the center, but the barbette was entirely enclosed by a large unarmoured superstructure that included accommodations for an admiral and his staff. She had a crew of 19 officers and 187 ratings. Her bluff hull form meant that she lost speed in heavy weather and, in some conditions, the ship could pitch enough to place her propellers out of the water. The biggest drawback to her hull shape was that it greatly reduced the rudder's ability to turn the ship by masking much of the flow of water; so much so that it took 40‚Äì45 minutes to make a full circle and the ship was almost unsteerable in a severe storm. The solution adopted was to use the engines for steering and leave the rudder fixed, even though this reduced the ship's speed. During a Force 7 storm, Vitse-admiral Popovs captain wrote that: \\"the vessel took on a lot of water through the hatches in front of the ventilators... The steering wheel was torn out of [one's] hands, and the vessel did not answer the helm; it was necessary to steer by means of the engines, and to make fast the rudder.\\"McLaughlin, pp. 118‚Äì19 The ship had eight vertical compound-expansion steam engines built by the Baird Works, using steam provided by twelve cylindrical boilers. The two inboard shafts were each driven by two engines, while the remaining four engines each powered a single propeller shaft. The two inboard three-bladed propellers were in diameter and the others were four- bladed and only in diameter. The engines produced a total of which gave her a speed of around . Vitse-admiral Popovs propulsion machinery proved problematic throughout her life as a result of defective workmanship and poor-quality materials. Her blunt hull form was not conducive to efficient steaming and she proved to be a prodigious consumer of coal as her capacity of only gave her range of at full speed. The ship had ventilation problems throughout her career, despite the later addition of a ventilation engine from the ironclad .McLaughlin, pp. 118, 121‚Äì23 Vitse-admiral Popov was armed with two 20-calibre rifled muzzle-loading guns. The guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . They were intended to use Moncrieff-type disappearing gun mounts that were elevated to fire and retracted below the top of the barbette to reload. The mounts were ordered from Britain, but tensions were at a high level in late 1876 and the Russians feared that the mounts would not be delivered on time. So scaled-up versions of the mounts used in Novgorod were built, although they proved not to be robust enough to handle the weight and recoil of the guns. Gunnery trials in October‚ÄìNovember showed the weaknesses of the mounts and damaged the adjacent superstructure. Further trials were conducted in April 1877 and were deemed satisfactory by the navy, although naval personnel still considered the mounts too weak.McLaughlin, pp. 119‚Äì20 Rear Admiral N. M. Chikhachev, commander of Odessa's naval defences during the Russo-Turkish War, reported that the guns could be fired at full power only \\"in case of extreme necessity\\".Quoted in McLaughlin, p. 120 The British-built mounts were delivered in early 1878, but were not installed until late in the year. They were traversed by a pair of steam engines that also powered the hydraulic systems that controlled recoil and elevation. Gunnery trials conducted in November showed that the system worked smoothly, although reloading time was around 14 minutes per gun. For protection against torpedo boats, four 4-pounder guns were mounted near the funnels. These guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a range of . Popov nearly doubled the thickness of the armour on Vitse-admiral Popov compared to that on Novgorod. The design was complicated by the inability of the Izhorskiye Zavody ironworks to roll armour plates more than thick, so Popov decided to build a \\"sandwich\\" of armour. The outer belt armour was separated by 9 inches of teak reinforced by interlocking channel irons from the inner armour layer, which was itself backed by another 9 inches of teak and channel irons. The upper strake of the outer armour was also 9 inches thick and the lower was thick. The inner armour was also 7 inches thick, which gave a total thickness of at the waterline and below it. The armour of the ship's barbette was identical to that of the upper strake of the belt armour. The rounded deck was protected by a total of of armour, made up of three layers of plates ranging in thickness from .McLaughlin, pp. 120‚Äì21  Construction and career  Unlike the earlier popovka, Novgorod, Vitse- admiral Popov was built at the Nikolaev Admiralty Shipyard. Construction began in January 1872, but was halted in mid-1872 when all of her workers were transferred to expedite the completion of Novgorod. Popov had already received approval to change the horizontal engines to vertical ones in March 1872 and decided to improve the ship based on the trials of Novgorod during the delay. The redesign meant that some of the work already completed had to be dismantled during late 1873 before construction began again in early 1874. The nominal keel-laying ceremony was on 8 September and she was launched on 7 October 1875. Vitse-admiral Popov was completed and entered service in 1876.McLaughlin, pp. 116‚Äì17 During the Russo-Turkish War, she was assigned to the defense of Odessa and her armament was reinforced by a pair of four- pounder guns mounted on the bridge wings. At some point early in her career, Vitse-admiral Popov was fitted with a telescoping spar torpedo. Together with Novgorod, the ship made a cruise to the Romanian town of Sulina on the Danube in mid-1878. Testing before the war revealed that the larger inboard propellers were more effective than the smaller outboard ones and that there was insufficient steam produced to supply all the engines, but the war delayed plans to remove the outermost pair until 1878. This reduced her total power to and her speed by about . After the war the ship received armoured covers for her engine room skylight and the central barbette hatch to protect against plunging fire. In 1883, Vitse-admiral Popov was reboilered and her old boilers were refurbished and transferred to Novgorod.McLaughlin, pp. 119‚Äì20, 122‚Äì23, 126 She was reclassified as a coast-defence ironclad on 13 February 1892 by which time her armament had been augmented by two quick-firing Hotchkiss five- barreled revolving cannon. These guns had a range of and a rate of fire of 32 rounds per minute. By the following year her hull and machinery were in poor condition. The ship was turned over to the Port Authority of Nikolaev for disposal on 2 May 1903 and stricken from the navy list on 4 July. Vitse- admiral Popov was offered for sale to Bulgaria in 1908, but the offer was not taken up. The ship was sold for scrap in December 1911.McLaughlin, pp. 122, 126 Myths and reality In his book, The World's Worst Warships, naval historian Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: > But in other respects, they were a dismal failure. They were too slow to > stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In > practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn out of control > and even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship > on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is > frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling > and pitching in anything more than a flat calm, and could not aim or load > their guns under such circumstances.Preston, pp. 27‚Äì28 The design of these ships was very controversial while they were being built in the 1870s, with many articles being published in the newspapers of the day by supporters and detractors, and later picked up by historians. One such account, published in 1875, claimed that Novgorod made an uncontrollable turn while on the Dniepr,McLaughlin, p. 123 while Reed, describing a time when the ship's engines on one side were reversed during a cruise in Sevastopol Bay, wrote: \\"The circular form is so extremely favourable to this kind of handiness that the Novgorod can easily be revolved on her centre at a speed which quickly makes one giddy. She can, nevertheless, be promptly brought to rest, and, if, needed have her rotary motion reversed.\\"Quoted in McLaughlin, p. 124 It would seem probable that the two reports quoted above were combined into the story as given by Fred T. Jane: \\"On a trial cruise, they (Novgorod and Vitse-admiral Popov) went up the Dniepr very nicely for some distance, till they turned to retire. Then the current caught them, and they were carried out to sea, whirled helplessly round and round, every soul on board helplessly incapacitated by vertigo.\\" The other criticisms made by Preston have been discussed earlier and the opinion of naval historian Stephen McLaughlin is a reasonable assessment of these ships: > In the final analysis, the popovkas seem to have been relatively effective > coast-defence vessels; certainly their combination of armament and armour > could have only been carried by a conventional ship of much greater draught. > Their faults ‚Äì and they certainly had faults ‚Äî were exaggerated by critics, > both in Russia and abroad, and have left as a legacy stories of > uncontrollable ships designed by incompetent men.McLaughlin, p. 125 Notes   Footnotes  Bibliography   Further reading  External links 1875 ships Naval ships of Russia Ironclad warships of the Imperial Russian Navy Ships built at Shipyard named after 61 Communards Ships built in the Russian Empire ","title":"Russian monitor Vitse-admiral Popov"},{"id":"47160368","text":"Oh!

Radio coloring was first studied by , under a different name, -labeling.. It was called radio coloring by Frank Harary because it models the problem of channel assignment in radio broadcasting, while avoiding electromagnetic interference between radio stations that are near each other both in the graph and in their assigned channel frequencies. The span of a radio coloring is its maximum label, and the radio coloring number of a graph is the smallest possible span of a radio coloring.. See in particular Section 3, \\"Radio coloring\\". For instance, the graph consisting of two vertices with a single edge has radio coloring number 3: it has a radio coloring with one vertex labeled 1 and the other labeled 3, but it is not possible for a radio coloring of this graph to use only the labels 1 and 2. Computational complexity Finding a radio coloring with a given (or minimum) span is NP-complete, even when restricted to planar graphs, split graphs, or the complements of bipartite graphs.. However it is solvable in polynomial time for trees and cographs.. For arbitrary graphs, it can be solved in singly-exponential time, significantly faster than a brute-force search through all possible colorings... Other properties Although the radio coloring number of an -vertex graph can range from 1 to , almost all -vertex graphs have radio coloring number exactly . This is because these graphs almost always have diameter at least two (forcing all vertices to have distinct colors, and forcing the radio coloring number to be at least ) but they also almost always have a Hamiltonian path in the complement graph. Consecutive vertices in this path can be assigned consecutive colors, allowing a radio coloring to avoid skipping any numbers..
