It is a ground orchid with a single, sparsely hairy leaf, and up to seven white flowers with a purplish labellum. Description Caladenia cucullata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, sparsely hairy, linear leaf, long and wide. Up to seven white flowers in diameter are borne on a spike high. The lateral sepals and petals are long, wide, narrow elliptic to egg-shaped and spread horizontally. The outer surface is covered with greenish to brownish glands, the inside white and glabrous, with the petals shorter and narrower than the sepals. The dorsal sepal is broadly egg-shaped, erect near the base but bends at about 90¬∞ near the middle, forming a hood over the column. The labellum is more or less egg- shaped, long about wide when flattened and has three lobes. It is white with reddish-purple marks and a dark purple, pointed tip. The sides of the labellum are wavy, more or less erect and the tip is strongly curved downwards. There are four regular rows of thick, club-shaped calli which decrease in size towards the tip of the labellum. The column is bent forwards, has wavy wings and red spots. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia cucullata was first formally described by Robert D. FitzGerald in 1876 and the description was published in Australian Orchids. The specific epithet (cucullata) is derived from the Latin word cucullus meaning \\"cap\\", or \\"hood\\". Distribution and habitat Hooded caladenia grows in forests, usually in poor sandy or stony soil. In New South Wales it is found on the tablelands and western slopes south from Dubbo, in Victoria it is widespread, especially in the goldfields and in South Australia it is uncommon, only ever found in the far south-east corner within a short distance from the Victorian border.

The principle of ecological modernization establishes the core literature of the functions that eco-restructuring has within a global regime. Eco- restructuring has an emphasis on the technological progressions within an ecological system. Government officials implement environmental policies to establish the industrial- ecological progressions that enable the motion of economic modernization. When establishing economic growth, policy makers focus on the progression towards a sustainable environment by establishing a framework of ecological engineering. Government funding is necessary when investing in efficient technologies to stimulate technological development. Environmental dimensions such as the preservation of landscape is achieved through sustainability. When analyzing the issues of sustainability, the importance of socio-technical transitions is highlighted to meet the needs of ecological policies. When an organization of resources is sustainable, it means that it will remain at a certain level of progress due to self- preservation without affecting the fundamental purpose of its existence. Changes in the industrial sector allows for sustainability to progress in an effective manner. When eco-restructuring is applied to the concept of sustainability, environmentally friendly technologies are essentially the main framework for clean and efficient productions. Social support and acknowledgement must be present when highlighting the functions of modernizing the ecological structures. To have a smooth transition between socio-technical categories, social agreement is important when introducing eco-restructuring methods. When forming new ecological policies, policy makers focus on the movement that sustainable environments have in regards to the social expectations. Economic production is an example of the existing relationship between eco-restructuring and sustainability. Cleaner production with minimal impact on the environment is the main idea behind the correlation of the two subjects. Since industrial ecology contributes to the direction of sustainability, eco-restructuring is perceived as a benefit for the environment and natural adaptation. Critics of the eco-restructuring and sustainability policies argue that a clear balance between a self-preserving ecological system and mass production is difficult to maintain. However, ecological engineering has been a major component used when applying eco- restructuring methods in the production of resources.  Origins  In 1998, the book Eco-restructuring: Implications for Sustainable Development was published by Robert Ayres. The book provided a significant contribution to the research of industrial- ecological progressions. Robert Ayres introduced a new prototype of eco-restructuring for sustainable development of technologies, economic movement and social lifestyles. The implication for cleaner and more efficient technologies contributes to the research of ecological construction.  Technologies  Efficient technologies are defined as services that reduce the non-renewable resources produced and increase the production rate. Renewable energy is a form of energy obtained from clean and natural resources. Solar and wind power technologies are examples of clean energy forms that would eliminate pollution produced from the coal and diesel energy sectors.  Economic movement  The economic movement outlined by Robert Ayers refers to the use of green economies. This type of economy structure looks at ways to reduce the environmental impacts. Nations focus on steering their policy agenda to allow the implementation of ecological strategies. This will accelerate the transformation of the economy sectors towards a clean and effective ecological state.  Social lifestyles  Human economic activities can influence the type of issues that ecological systems face. These social lifestyles are subject to the changes in the production of goods and services. An example of this idea would be the collection of raw materials and disposing them in a proper efficient manner that will have little impact on the environment. If the whole cycle is restructured to meet the principles of ecological regulation, then experts would have to analyze the effects of human activities and determine a possible alternative to the removal of biomedical waste and other raw materials. Many of the eco-restructuring principles were outlined in the Eco-restructuring: Implications for Sustainable Development book. However, policy makers can also have an opinion on the ideas and promises that this method of sustainability offers. Certain factors can influence the regulations that the policies cover such as the need for sustainable development. Legislative measures are also developed based on the propositions of ecological and economical advantages. The principle of sustainable development applies to the restructuring of technologies, economic movement and social lifestyles. These principles have helped to determine an evolution of the ecological system.  Environmental factors  When an ecological system is altered, environmental standards must be put in place to preserve the stability of the environment. The application of eco- restructuring seeks to improve the environmental stability in relation to manufacturing and waste management. However, ecological effects can occur by following improper procedures. Despite the precautions that must be considered, there are environmental benefits of ecological modernization such as renewable energy. The use of renewable energy would eliminate the threat of ecological dangers such as pollution. Modern technologies also have a role in the impact of the environment. When new technologies are developed, sustainability is achieved through improving the environmental dimensions .  Eco-restructuring and sustainability  Socio-technical transitions correlate to the need for social change in the study of sustainable resources. Sustainability has a significant role in the fields of management such as education, health care, economics, ecology and technology. The main framework for clean and efficient productions is supported by the idea of a self- preserving system. Despite the research supporting the reformation of the ecological system, natural resources can suffer a depletion and will need the support of sustainability to preserve its existence. New policies are required to move towards equality and sustainability since the social expectations reflect the relationship between the two concepts. The public perception for an alternative solution to sustainable development is reflected through the ecological policies enacted by government officials. Eco-restructuring offers a positive aspect to the principles of ecological modernization. It is an alternative to the motion of technological progressions within the global economic regime.

It takes its name from the Val di Livo, in the province of Como, in Lombardy in northern Italy. Most of the data on the breed dates to 1983. Its conservation status is not clear; it may be extinct.  History  The origins of the Livo are unknown. It originates in the Val di Livo, in the province of Como, in Lombardy in northern Italy, and is named for the Livo river or for the comune of Livo. It shows similarity to the Ciavenasca breed of the Valchiavenna, in the province of Sondrio further to the north. It may have been influenced by Merinolandschaf (W√ºrttemberger) stock imported to the southern part of the area of Lake Como in the 1950s, and possibly also by lop-eared Alpine breeds such as the Bergamasca and the Brianzola. Data on the breed dates to 1983, when there were approximately 500 head. The Livo was, but is no longer, among the autochthonous local sheep breeds of limited distribution officially recognised by the Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali, the Italian ministry of agriculture. A herd-book is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- breeders; it has been empty for many years. In 2007 the Livo was classified by the FAO as \\"extinct\\".  Characteristics  The Livo is well adapted to its mountain environment, where pastures may be very steep.

He was politically active from an early age and later worked as a journalist for several local left-leaning newspapers. During his tenure as mayor, he became known for his opposition to car traffic and he stopped several infrastructure projects that would have required large-scale demolitions of the historic inner city.  Political career  Jensen started his political career early on and served on the board of Denmark's Socialdemocratic Youth from 1927 to 1932. During the same period he was active in antimilitaristic work and between 1929 and 1935 he was on the board of the national association of the organization Aldrig Mere Krig (Never more war). He remained opposed to militarism after the Danish Social Democratic Party changed course on the issue and he remained committed to it throughout his life. He graduated from N. J. Fjordsgades Skole in 1927 and then started as an intern on the local newspaper Aarhus Venstreblad, associated with the Danish Social Liberal Party. He later became a journalist on the Social Democratic newspaper Demokraten where he covered a number of different topics. He first ran for Aarhus city council in 1941 as the 11th candidate on the social democratic list. Due to the occupation during the Second World War the election was postponed to 1943 when he was finally elected. In 1946, he was elected chairman and spokesperson of the social democratic group. He became a councilman for the 4th department of the magistrate, the department for schools and culture management, from 1 October 1950 and became mayor from 1 October 1958. Jensen had great respect for the urban environment in Aarhus and was an ardent opponent of car traffic. He became famous for moving around the city on a bicycle after he abolished the mayor's car. He stopped plans to build roads through the historic city center, which would have demolished large parts of it. Instead, he worked actively to preserve historical buildings and neighborhoods. In the 1960s, Jensen worked to merge Aarhus Municipality with a number of smaller surrounding municipalities and it was successfully concluded in 1970. In 1971, he retired as mayor due to health problems and was replaced by Orla Hyllested.  Author  Beyond his work as a journalist, Jensen was also known as a writer in other areas. During his youth, he published poems in the magazine Vild Hvede, although he later focused his efforts on local historical subjects. He wrote several works about local history including: * Fra det glade √Örhus, 1963 * Som √Örhus morede sig, 1966 * Da √Örhus var Hollywood, 1969 * Marselisborgskovene, 1974 (with his brother Peder Jensen) * Bernhardt Jensen beretter om √Örhus (posthumously published 1979)  Honors  In 1978, Jensen was awarded an honorary degree at Aarhus University for his work in local history although he died the same year before he could officially receive it. The neighborhood Aarhus Docklands under development through the 2010s has a street named after Bernhard Jensen; the main street Bernhard Jensens Boulevard. The local edition of Jyllandsposten recognized Jensen as \\"alle tiders aarhusianer\\" (All time Aarhusian), leading to a bipartisan committee collecting funds for a statue to be created by artist Jan Balling. The proposal was submitted to Aarhus City Council on 15 April 2009 and on 13 April 2010, on Jensen's 100th birthday, the statue \\"Manden med cyklen\\" (Man with bike) was unveiled on √Öboulevarden where it overlooks the river and Immervad towards the Latin Quarter.

The site is not officially a state park, but rather a State Recreational Waterway and managed River Corridor. The park consists of the state-owned Smith River; a Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) put-in access point, Camp Baker; 27 FWP-owned and -leased boat camps on the shore of the river; and the FWP- owned Eden Bridge take-out point. Little of the area is owned by FWP. Much of the surrounding shoreline is owned by the United States Forest Service, United States Bureau of Land Management, and private owners. Through management agreements with other government agencies and private landowners, FWP manages the Smith River Corridor as a \\"virtual state park\\". The Smith River is the only river in the state of Montana where a permit is required to boat or float on the river. About the Smith River The Smith River is a long river which begins about southwest of White Sulphur Springs, Montana, and continues on a north-westerly and northerly course, passing between the Big Belt Mountains and Little Belt Mountains, before reaching a confluence with the Missouri River at Ulm, Montana. The river is generally divided into three sections. The first begins at the river's headwaters and runs for through a high valley between the two mountain ranges. The second, about long, runs through the Smith River Canyon Valley and features spectacular mountain scenery. The third, about long, begins at the canyon mouth and ends at the river's confluence with the Missouri. This final segment passes briefly through the foothills of the mountains and then onto the Great Plains, the water's speed slowing significantly as it does so. For nearly all of its length, the river is too shallow for motorized boating. Water flows are highest from mid-April through early July, with levels usually dropping too low by late July to permit boating. A very limited number of roads and private ownership of most of both sides of the river limited public access to the Smith into the 1950s. Some recreational use, primarily fishing, unpowered boating, and \\"floating\\" began on the river in the late 1950s. As the public sought greater access to the Smith River for recreation, conflicts with private landowners emerged. Although the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) owned some of the shoreline, these federal agencies were not very responsive to local demands for access. The state of Montana stepped into this leadership vacuum to seek a mutually agreeable solution. Creating a recreational waterway Proposals were first made by citizens of Montana in 1953 to turn state-owned school trust land on the Smith River into recreational areas. Although the Montana Department of Fish and Game (DFG; the predecessor agency to the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks) supported these recommendations in 1954, and the Montana Wildlife Federation lobbied for them in 1954, 1956, 1957, and 1958, no action was taken by the state legislature. In 1960, the DFG purchased a site, now known as the Smith River Fishing Access, about north of Fort Logan (accessed today via Fishing Access Road, off Smith River Road north of Montana Secondary Highway 360). Public use of the Smith River increased significantly in the 1960s, creating issues of safety and worsening the conflict between private landowners and the public. To create a new public access site, the Camp Baker Fishing Access Site was purchased from private landowners in 1968. The site, which provided boat launches (\\"put-in\\") as well as fishing access, was named after Camp Baker, the original military facility at the site of Fort Logan. DFG attempted to purchase other sites as well, but these efforts failed. Two subdivisions in the Smith River Canyon, one at Castle Bar and another at Two Creeks, occurred in the 1960s. These deeply alarmed recreationists, who feared despoliation of this most scenic part of the river. Private landowners also worried about additional development, fearing the loss of the farming and ranching lifestyle to urbanization as well as the loss of the scenic viewshed they treasured. In response to these concerns, in 1969 the Montana Fish and Game Commission (the rulemaking body for the DFG) designated the Smith a State Recreational Waterway. This banned motorized boating on the Smith. The same year, the Montana Legislature adopted House Joint Resolution 12, which ordered the state's executive branch to study the Smith River's resources in order to assess its potential for recreation. Governor Forrest H. Anderson ordered the Governor's Council on Natural Resources and Development, an interagency coordinating group, to conduct the report. The council considered three alternatives: Designating the Smith River a state park; designating the Smith a National Wild and Scenic River, and improved management without any new designation. The body declined to consider no management (the status quo) or managing solely for the benefit of local landowners. The report, issued on November 20, 1970, recommended the third option, with the added element that state follow through on its designation of the Smith River as a State Recreational Waterway. The study also concluded that the Smith River was a navigable waterway, which made the water and riverbed state property (and subject to much more intensive state regulation). This was a critical finding, for the United States Constitution, various rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States, the Montana statehood act, and federal law gave title to the beds of navigable waters to the state, and the state had the right to regulate access and use of its property. Moreover, Montana state law declared all navigable waters open for public use. Management from 1970 to 1980 By 1970, more than 55 percent of the Smith River Canyon shoreline was in private hands, primarily ranchers and vacation homeowners. Another 15 percent of the land was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad and the Anaconda Copper Company. While the Smith River Fishing Access site had picnic tables and seating, pit latrines, and limited garbage disposal, the Camp Baker site remained undeveloped. Recreational use of the Smith River rose significantly throughout the 1970s, worsening conflicts between private landowners and floaters over access, cross-stream fencing, human waste disposal, litter, trespassing, and vandalism. The Department of Fish and Game began developing \\"floater gates\\" to allow recreational users to pass downstream but which contained cattle. DFG also attempted to purchase land for new public access and boat camp sites to ease access and trespass problems, although these efforts proved fruitless. Other issues also occupied the DFG. As additional subdivisions occurred, the department sought to purchase this land to keep development from occurring. But it lacked the money to do so. In 1973, the DFG completed its first natural resource inventory of the Smith River, a necessary step toward the department's first formal management plan for the river. The report was not comprehensive, focusing primarily on big game, sport fish, game birds, and ducks. The report made a number of recommendations, including: 1) New state legislation to protect the river; 2) Adoption of a statewide water quality and water monitoring plan; 3) A rural zoning act, to minimize development along rivers and streams; 4) Appropriation of extensive funds to allow DFG to purchase land along the Smith River; and 5) Adoption of a sport fish management plan. This last recommendation included limiting the fishing season, adopting limits on the number of fish taken (\\"creel limits\\"), encouragement of commercial fishing of undesirable fish, and the stocking of hatchery-raised sport fish. Another major area of concern for the DFG was water flow. By mid-July each year, snowpack in the mountains (the major source of water for the Smith River) had completely melted away. Combined with irrigation in the upper Smith River, this meant that water levels on the Smith were too low by mid-summer to support recreational boating or floating. Low water levels also hurt the sport fishery, but although DFG attempted to secure additional water rights these efforts largely failed over the next 20 years. In 1974, DFG abandoned its attempt to manage the Smith River as a sport fishery, and instead began implementing a wild trout fishery management plan. This meant stocking only native fish, as needed, and no more stocking of nonnative sport fish. Management from 1980 to 1988 Smith River with late spring snows. Early management efforts The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP; DFG underwent a name change in 1979) began more intensive management of the Smith River in 1980. Floater gates and hazard signs were installed for the first time, and the FWP established the first boat camps. FWP's budget for managing the Smith River was approximately $10,000 a year ($ in dollars). At the start of the decade, only about 1,400 individuals floated the river each year, 87 percent of them putting-in at Camp Baker. FWP's stated policy was to limit access to the Smith River to keep the number of floaters low. This not only would preserve the river's near-wild state, but maintain high levels of privacy and solitude for floaters. It also helped to keep conflicts with local private landowners to a minimum. FWP also worked cooperatively with the USFS, which largely bowed to FWP's wishes when it came to managing the river and its watershed. Yet, over the next eight years, FWP undertook a wide range of actions which served to increase the number of floaters. In 1981, FWP began asking users to voluntary register before putting-in at Camp Baker. Both BLM and FWP hired a ranger to patrol the river mid-April to mid-July (the floating season), which made the Smith River the first in Montana to have a river ranger. (BLM discontinued its ranger in 1982.) That same year, the department began leasing of land at Eden Bridge as a place where floaters could land and leave the river (a \\"take-out point\\"). Eden Bridge also served as a parking lot for floaters, who usually carpooled (along with their supplies and equipment) to Camp Baker. In 1983, FWP issued a contract for a concession for a shuttle service to run from Great Falls to Eden Bridge to Camp Baker, which allowed floaters to retrieve their vehicles at the put-in point or return to the nearby city. More expansion occurred that year as well as the state built a warm-season cabin for park rangers at Camp Baker and pit latrines at high-use boat camps. The state also greatly expanded its footprint in the Smith River watershed, engaging in a land swap with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, and the Montana Department of State Lands. This transaction added 13 new parcels of FWP land totaling . With the establishment of the Eden Bridge take-out point and shuttle service, Camp Baker became the exclusive put-in site. Float trips now became an almost-standard four day journey. Implementation of voluntary registration Use of the Smith River increased markedly after 1981 after an article praising the river appeared in The New Yorker magazine and the Coleman Company featured the river in advertisements for its new Scanoe boat. FWP began sending deputized game wardens down the river (sometimes even in disguise) to fine users who violated FWP regulations or engaged in trespassing or vandalism. In 1984, DFG formed the \\"Concerned Citizens of the Smith River Canyon\\", ad hoc group consisting of local landowners, outfitters, members of the public, and a representative from USFS. Referred to informally as the \\"Ad Hoc Committee\\", this group met monthly to identify and resolves conflicts, advise FWP on Smith River policies, and encourage cooperation among Smith River stakeholders. The group proved highly influential into the early 1990s. Use rose again after passage of the Montana Stream Access Law in 1985, which legally opened all navigable rivers and streams in Montana to recreation. In reaction, local landowner Louise Rankin Galt closed the popular Indian Springs boat camp after concluding that floaters would begin to treat her property as public land. By 1986, use of the Smith River for floating and fishing was so heavy, that the state began asking users to inform it when they used the river. The voluntary reservation system allowed the FWP to assess, for the first time, use of the river. The agency also began leasing sites from private landowners for use as boat camps. By the end of the year, FWP had eight boat camps on USFS land, five on FWP land, and three on private land. Pit latrines now existed at 10 of the boat camps and at both access sites, and Camp Baker and Eden Bridge now both contained extensive parking lots as well as overnight camping facilities. The Shouse study At the end of 1986, FWP released its first report analyzing public use of the Smith River, and making recommendations for additional protections of the river corridor. The Ad Hoc Committee had identified the need for a usage study in 1985, and the FWP contracted with consultant Joel Shouse of Bozeman, Montana, to do the work. Shouse analyzed FWP surveys from 1985, looking for a correlation between the number of individuals on the river on a given day and floaters' sense of being overcrowded. The data indicated a clear (if arbitrary, and highly contextual) cut-off point of 100 floaters per day as the maximum \\"carrying capacity\\" of the Smith River. Although other factors, such as boat camp availability, put- in wait times, private landowner complaints, and environmental damage were considered, none of these correlated with high floater numbers. Only floater opinion (\\"feeling overcrowded\\") correlated with high usage. With floater use of the Smith River rapidly increasing, FWP had tasked Shouse with making recommendations as to how use might be controlled or limited in the future. Shouse suggested five stages of increasing restrictions. Usage statistics would be reviewed at the end of each year; if use was higher than the carrying capacity, then the next level of restrictions would be implemented. The five suggested stages were: *Stage 1 - Existing level of management. This involved continuing the floater surveys and voluntary floater registration, but now asking users to voluntarily declare which boat camps they intended to use during their trip. *Stage 2 - Floater registration would be mandatory. Each floater would be required to have a permit, which was self-issued at Camp Baker, and to attach this registration as a tag to their watercraft. *Stage 3 - A maximum limit would be placed on the number of permits issued during the peak float period (Memorial Day weekend to Independence Day weekend). *Stage 4 - A maximum limit on the number of permits issued each day of the floating season. *Stage 5 - Implementation of a lottery system for permits once user demand exceeded the total number of annual permits. Shouse also suggested that the FWP create a special category of permits just for outfitters, and limit the number of outfitter permits to a small percentage of the total number of permits. Stage 1 of the Shouse report's floater restrictions was implemented in 1987. The 1988 Smith River Management Plan Implementing the additional stages required a more formal process. Throughout 1987, FWP held hearings and solicited comments on Shouse report, with an eye toward issuing a more complete management plan. This management document, the \\"Smith River Management Plan\\", was issued in 1988. Shouse's data analysis, findings, and recommendations were almost completely incorporated into the 1988 plan. FWP made one change to the recommendations, deciding to base carrying capacity on the total number of float parties per day rather than the total number of floaters. FWP used the average size of a float party in 1985 (6.5 individuals), determining that the floater carrying capacity was 15 float parties per day. FWP also imposed a maximum size of 15 on the number of individuals a float party could contain, as this was the maximum capacity of the boat camps each night. As is readily apparent, this formula did little to restrict use of the Smith River if float party size increased from 6.5 to the maximum of 15 (a 125 percent increase in the number of floaters). Implementation of the Stage 1 management rules went into effect smoothly, although floaters disliked having their watercraft tagged. To implement any additional stages, however, would take legislative authority. At the urging of FWP, the Montana State Legislature enacted the Smith River Management Act in 1989. This legislation authorized FWP to enact regulations governing the use of the Smith River. The act required that the agency \\"1) continue the compatible uses of recreational and public land uses, 2) ...maintain the public's opportunity to enjoy the natural scenic beauty and solitude, and 3) ...conserve the recreational, aesthetic, and scientific values of the Smith River.\\" To this end, the commission was specifically empowered to allocate use among recreational and commercial users, adopt a usage permitting system, and to regulate both water and land use in the Smith River watershed to achieve the purposes of the act. Most importantly, the legislation authorized the Fish and Game Commission to establish and collect fees for various types of use of the Smith River Recreational Waterway. The act also designated FWP as the agency with primary authority over the Smith River. Management since 1989 The same year that the state enacted the Smith River Management Act, the U.S. Forest Service altered its management plan for the Lewis and Clark National Forest, identifying the Smith River as suitable for study as a National Wild and Scenic River. But no further action was taken, although the USFS did agreement try to maintain its portion of the Smith River shoreline to preserve those elements which contributed to Wild and Scenic River designation. Nevertheless, the river remained undesignated by 2015. Despite implementation of Stage 1 of the management plan, a record number of floaters (2,395) used the Smith River in 1989. This was an increase of 63.8 percent over the 1988 level (1,462 floaters). The Smith River Management Act changed the way FWP managed the Smith River. The Smith was the state's most intensely managed river, and the only one to be managed by the state rather than a county or federal agency. Management of the Smith was similar to the level of management of the nation's most intensely controlled rivers (such as the Colorado River and Selway River), and according to the press was the most intensely-managed state-controlled river in the nation. To accommodate this management, several new staff positions were created to implement the plan, including a full-time manager (although the waterway continued to be managed day-to-day by staff in FWP's Region Four headquarters in Great Falls. 1990: Mandatory permitting In 1990, FWP implemented Stage 2 of its management plan. Every float group now had to have a permit, obtained at Camp Baker, which they had to attach to their watercraft.; By issuing permits only at Camp Baker, this system effectively limited the number of floaters to only those groups prepared to spend four days on the river. 1991: Group limits and user fees When the number of floaters rose 10.8 percent in 1990 to 2,654, FWP was forced to implement Stage 3 of the management plan in 1991. It limited float groups to no more than 15 individuals per group (including commercial outfitter staff), and required everyone‚Äîno matter where they put-in‚Äîto make a boat camp designation if they spent the night on the river. FWP also began charging both private and commercial floaters on the Smith River fees to obtain permits. These were the first user fees ever to be implemented on a state-owned or -managed river. Fees had not been mentioned in the 1986 Shouse study, but the idea had been broached by FWP officials during public hearings on the 1988 management plan. The Ad Hoc Committee discussed several alternative fee plans in 1990, and FWP had considered implementing fees that year. FWP surveyed roughly 280 former floaters, more than three-quarters of whom supported mandatory registration and permit fees. To assist the Forest Service in implementing its plans to protect the Smith River watershed, the FWP began remitting those fees paid by commercial outfitters to the Lewis & Clark National Forest. Income generated by user fees allowed FWP to hire a second river ranger to patrol the Smith, enforcing regulations, mediating conflict with landowners, maintaining boat camps, and picking up floater logs at Eden Bridge. This allowed the other ranger to remain at Camp Baker, collecting fees, issuing permits, handing out regulation pamphlets, and overseeing the campsite. User fees and group size limitations had little impact on the number of users by mid-1991, and the total number of floaters rose 7.1 percent to 2,842. This forced FWP to implement Stage 4 of its management plan. With the number of requests for recreational floater permits exceeding the available supply, FWP initiated the first \\"lottery\\" (random drawing) to award permits on oversubscribed days. The agency also limited the number of commercial launches per day to two, began assigning boat camps to outfitters, and limited the ways in which commercial outfitter permits could be transferred. The agency also decided to permit no more than 20 outfitters to operate on the river. This reflected the public's perception that outfitters generally represented wealthy, out-of-state clients, and FWP (despite strong outfitter opposition) decided to favor the public over outfitters. Severe drought struck Montana in 1992, severely limiting the floating season. FWP took advantage of the low number of users to add electricity and running water to the Camp Baker and Eden Bridge campsites. 1992 also saw FWP establish a \\"Corridor Enhancement Account\\" designed to build a fund for protecting and improving the Smith River Corridor. 1992 also saw the FWP and U.S. Forest Service sign a contract, the Smith River Maintenance and Operating Agreement. USFS agreed to continue to allow boat camps to be maintained on its property, and pledged to give special consideration to the river in its planning. Both parties agreed to establish and \\"Annual Operating Plan\\", whereby they would coordinate activities and management, share information, engage in joint law enforcement, and coordinate land transactions. They also agreed not to undertake any improvements to the Smith River corridor without the agreement of the other, and USFS agreed to follow the procedures outlined in the National Environmental Policy Act (insofar as not constrained by law or appropriation) when making decisions regarding the Smith River corridor. The subsequent Annual Operating Plan provided for FWP to reimburse USFS for certain costs associated with Smith River management, signage, supplies, and other things. USFS' outfitter permitting and fee collection were left undisturbed by the agreements, and FWP reimbursed outfitters for fees paid to the Forest Service. 1993: Launch limits Although the number of users in 1992 was an extremely low 782, the trend toward increasing use of the Smith River led FWP to implement Stage 5 of its management plan in 1993. Stage 5 was adopted as a regulatory rulemaking by the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Commission, the rulemaking body of the FWP. Through staff input and public hearings, a number of modifications were made to Stage 5. The new management plan forced all users to preregister in order to obtain a user permit. The total number of launches per day was limited to just nine, only nine commercial launches were permitted each week from Memorial Day to Independence Day, and the number of approved outfitters was lowered from 20 to 16. Boat camp declaration by all users was now mandatory, and several large boat camps were divided into separate, smaller camps. This left the Smith River with 16 boat camps, with up to four separate campsites per camp. The Smith River became the first river in the state to impose launch limitations, and made it one of fewer than 40 such rivers in the entire nation to have them. The significant increases in users and user fee income over the past several years again significantly altered how FWP managed the Smith. FWP's Smith River management budget had remained relatively stable at $10,000 a year from 1980 to 1985, but during the 1986-to-1991 period it rose to $25,000 ($ in dollars), and from 1992 to 1995 it was nearly $70,000 a year ($ in dollars). The park manager now spent most of the float season fielding calls from members of the public inquiring about permit availability on any given day, even though most permits were issued long before the float season began. Last-minute cancellations were common. If floaters cancelled ahead of time, the Region Four headquarters would assign the permit to the next float group on the waiting list. But many float groups did not cancel ahead of time, and numerous floaters appeared every day at Camp Baker in the hope of obtaining a permit. In 1993, FWP also changed what fees went into the Corridor Enhancement Account. Ten percent of all recreational user fees were deposited in the account, and outfitter fees were increased from $15 per individual to $65 per individual‚Äîwith the $50 increase going to the CEA. Increasing use and 1996 management plan A total of 3,604 users floated on the Smith River in 1993, 246.5 percent more than floated the river when the management plan came into force in 1988. In July 1994, user fees were so high that they enabled the FWP to purchase the Eden Bridge take-out, and they continued to pay for the presence of a full-time river ranger (the only river in the state to have one). FWP now managed four developed access sites (Smith River Fishing Access Site, Camp Baker, Eden Bridge, and Truly Bridge) and four undeveloped access sites (Fort Logan Bridge, Johnston Bridge, upper Smith River Road Bridge, and lower Smith River Road Bridge). It maintained 27 boat camps (nine of them leased from private landowners), which contained 54 camp sites. Although the 1988 management plan called for protecting additional land in the Smith River corridor, FWP's budget and the small size of the CEA meant that the agency had been able to purchase no conservation easements or leases, acquire no new land, engage in no new land exchanges or transactions, and had no zoning authority to protect the viewshed. In 1994, the Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Commission engaged in its regular biennial rulemaking, which established rules and regulations governing the state's parks and protected areas. For the first time, the commission brought the Smith River into this rulemaking for the 1994-1995 rule. The rationale was that the 1988 management plan had served its purpose, and a more formal, broader type of regulatory action was needed. Input was solicited from the Ad Hoc Committee, the Smith River Coordinated Resources Management Council, the public, floaters (using 1990 and 1993 surveys and annual floater logs), and landowners (using a 1990 survey, and ongoing discussions with rangers). As part of the new Biennial Rule, launch limits no longer applied to private landowners along the Smith River as of 1995, allowing these property owners and their immediate families to day-float on the river. (These landowners were still required to register their day- floats with the FWP, however, to allow for statistical collection.) The biennial rule significantly revised the way the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks defined the river's carrying capacity. Capacity now had four components: Physical (use that degrades the physical resources of the river), Facility (the physical capacity of parking lots and boat camps), Social (use that degrades the key social value of solitude), and Managerial (a combination of Physical and Social). The agency admitted that it was limited in the kinds of statistics it could collect to measure capacity. FWP set standards for each measurement, although it did not delineate how it set these standards. The agency limited its regulation to group size and the number of launches each day, although it recognized that regulating length of stay, type of use, time of use (certain seasons or days of the week), type of craft, and environmental impact were also possible. In 1995, as the biennial rule was being finalized, FWP updated its agreement with USFS. Now known as the \\"Challenge Cost Share Agreement\\", the agreement now provided for USFS to make an annual grant to FWP to support its activities on the Smith River. The parties agreed to update the contract annually. (By 2008, this grant was $7,000 [$ in dollars].) Although the number of total users dropped to 3,184 in 1994, it rose to 4,054 in 1995‚Äîa 12.5 percent increase over 1993. Beginning with the 1996 float season, FWP limited the number of individuals in each group to a monthly average of eight. No more three days of each month could see more than 45 groups on the river, and no more than six days of each month could see more than 300 floaters on the river. (This effectively limited group size to 6.5 people, the same number developed in the 1988 plan.) The agency concluded that the CEA lacked an effective implementation plan, and that the FWP had no plan for preserving the river corridor or how to achieve its preservation goals. The biennial rule required FWP to refer any proposals to the Ad-Hoc Committee, and to prepare annually a list of all private land adjacent to the recreational waterway. The list would be used to by FWP staff to develop a \\"protection strategy\\" for each of these parcels. 1996 to 2009 management Although the number of total users dropped to 4,409 in 1996 and to 4,771 in 1997 (an all-time high)‚Äîa nearly 50 percent increase three years. The average number of floaters per group, however, was 6.4, just below the standard set in the 1996 plan. A permit cancellation policy was adopted in 1998. Cancellations, some made ahead of time and some not, some reported to FWP and some not, had long been a problem, and FWP believed they contributed to under-use of the river and contributed to public dissatisfaction with the permit policy. Beginning in 1991, FWP began to distribute cancelled permits to outfitters and private groups on the permit waiting list. But with the rapid rise in the number of people using the Smith River, FWP changed this policy in 1998, so that cancelled permits would not be reissued on any week when the number of people on the river exceeded 300. Although the total numbers of floaters on the river declined slightly in 1998 to 4,128, average group rise rose to 6.47. With the average number of users on the river each day exceeding 300 in 1998, FWP altered its cancellation policy once more. Beginning June 10 and ending July 10 (the height of the floating season), the agency declined to reissue any cancelled permits. The total number of users on the river in 1999 stayed relatively steady at 4,120, but average group size rose to 7.05. But as the cancellation policy took hold, the total number of users dropped substantially to 2,596 in 2000 (6.3 average group size), and to 2,262 in 2001 (6.37 average group size). But as users accommodated themselves to the new policy, use rose again. It soared to 3,541 total users in 2002 (6.68 average group size). With annual use consistently double that of the 1980s, user impacts began to degrade the Smith River environment. Most noticeably, firewood became scarce. Boat camps were outfitted with steel fire rings in 2003 to help reduce the impact on forests adjacent to the Smith River and to help minimize the risk of fire. By requiring floaters to keep their fires inside the fire rings, larger fires and bonfires‚Äîwhich consumed extremely large amounts of wood‚Äîwere effectively eliminated. That year, 3,714 total users were on the Smith. Average group size, however, reached 7.03. With the group size standard violated once again, FWP modified the cancellation policy a third time at the end of the 2003 season. Now, when the FWP reissued cancelled permits from May 25 through July 10, it did so to groups with eight or fewer individuals. Although total users rose 3.8 percent in 2004 to 3,855 total users, average group size fell to 6.57. It rose 2.2 percent in 2005 to 3,941 total users, but average group size again fell to 6.38. In 2005, the Montana state legislature enacted House Bill 312, which limited the ways FWP could spend user fees collected on the Smith River. The law required that these fees must be used for three purposes: protecting and enhancing the waterway through the lease or acquisition of property; the protection, enhancement, and restoration of fisheries habitat and recreational values; and projects that maintain and enhance water flows into the river. In 2006, the number of total users rose to 4,736, and average group size to 7.03. In December of the same year, the FWP adopted new rules governing commercial activities on all restricted-use rivers in Montana. Called Restricted Use Permits (RUPs), the new permits placed new regulations on outfitters to enhance licensure, insurance, safety, and other aspects of the outfitter experience. In 2007, FWP built a new office and three-bedroom house at Camp Baker to accommodate its staff of park rangers, which has grown to two. (A third ranger was added in 2008.) The FWP also updated its Smith River Management Plan for the first time, and created a new Citizen's Advisory Council. As FWP took no new action in 2006 to further restrict use of the Smith River, total users declined in 2007 to 4,329 but average group size rose significantly to 7.39. Total users declined again in 2008 to 3,814, and the average group size to 6.45. A third ranger was stationed at Camp Baker in 2008. 2009 rulemaking A decade after adoption of the 1996 management plan, and with several user standards flirting with repeated violation, FWP undertook a new rulemaking process in June 2007 with the intent of issuing a new management plan. Instead of relying on the Ad Hoc Committee and the Smith River Coordinated Resources Management Council, FWP established a new, eight-person Citizen Advisory Committee to identify issues and recommend actions. The CAC held 12 meetings over the next year while FWP staff conducted research, studied recreation and outfitter surveys and floater logs, and interviewed experts. Importantly, FWP also conducted an Environmental Assessment as outlined by federal law (NEPA) and rules. The draft plan and rulemaking were put online and public comments solicited for 45 days, during which FWP held five public meetings. The final rule and plan were issued on July 20, 2009. The Smith River State Park and River Corridor Recreation Management Plan was designed to govern management of the waterway for the next 10 to 15 years. The rulemaking utilized a new conceptual framework known as Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC). Developed in the early 1970s, and focused decision-makers on \\"conditions desired in the area rather than on how much use an area can tolerate.\\" FWP described the LAC process as identifying desired conditions, identifying indicators which monitor these conditions, and finally setting standards beyond which change is unacceptable. FWP essentially abandoned its definition of \\"solitude\\" and a high-quality recreational experience after floater surveys showed that‚Äîdespite significantly exceeding total daily user and average group size guidelines in 1996, 1997, 1999, 2003, 2006, and 2007‚Äîfloaters were overwhelmingly highly satisfied with their float experience. \\"FWP concluded that the number of groups and the number of people in the corridor at one time is useful in terms of boat camp capacities but is less effective for determining acceptable social conditions. ... A more useful indicator for quality of experience is the number of times a person encounters other boats on the river during the course of a day.\\" But the final rule continued to employ the existing indicators (number of launches per day and maximum group size). A new indicator, a Likert scale asking floaters \\"to rate their level of satisfaction with the number of other boats they observed on the river\\", was also established to help identify \\"solitude\\". New management efforts, such as outreach to reduce public expectations of solitude, incentives to reduce group size or the number of watercraft used by a group, and even closure of boat camps were contemplated. Limited restrictions were imposed on local landowners, however. The number outfitters was reduced from 16 to nine, after an FWP analysis showed that outfitters were trading permits and that only nine outfitters were actively engaged in floating the Smith. The rulemaking also addressed problems with the CEA. A CAC investigation discovered that the Smith River Corridor Enhancement Account had a balance of $346,490 ($ in dollars). But not a single penny of the account had been spent since its inception in 1991. The new rule required FWP to establish guidelines for evaluating proposals to spend CEA money, and solicit proposals from the public and staff. To improve conditions of \\"solitude\\" on the Smith River, the 2009 rule also required FWP to undertake a more rational approach to the boat camps. In part, this meant using CEA funds to acquire land (or, as a preferred alternative, leases on land) for new, isolated boat camps. As new camps were built or land acquired, FWP would also close camps which were within sight of one another and which contributed to a reduction in \\"solitude\\". Although it gave no time- frame for accomplishing the goal, the rule also required FWP to undertake a limited LAC planning process for boat camps, which would include monitoring boat camps for environmental degradation (such as damage to or loss of vegetation, compacted ground, etc.), establishing goals to meet, and undertaking management (such as education and outreach, incentive-based programs, plantings, and closure or relocation of boat camps) to achieve the goals. The rulemaking process also uncovered new evidence of significant environmental degradation on the Smith River. Pursuant to a request by FWP in 2002, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) studied the level of fecal coliform in the Smith River. That study concluded that human waste (feces and urine) was not causing a measurable increase in fecal coliform bacteria in the river. Between 2003 and 2008, DEQ abandoned fecal coliform as a standard for evaluating water quality, and implemented a new standard based on Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a better indicator of whether enough pathogens existed in the water to make people ill. Reviewing the 2003 study, DEQ discovered that the new standard had been violated by significant levels on the Smith River. Moreover, problems with pit latrines at the boat camps were emerging. Staff spent significant amounts of time digging new latrines, new latrines meant new trails had to be cut through the undergrowth, floaters disposed of non-degradable trash in the latrines, and space was running out for new latrines. FWP began to consider whether floaters should be required to pack human waste out. Post-2009 management Little had changed in the Smith River corridor between 1970 and 2009. About 70 percent of the land adjacent to the river was still in private hands in 2009, and only a single put-in and a single take-out site existed. Fishing access had expanded through the development of the Newlan Creek Reservoir (leased), Fort Logan, Truly Bridge, and Lower Smith River Bridges, and more boat camps existed, but few other improvements had been made. FWP's budget for managing the Smith River rose and fell, sometimes sharply, although FWP had little explanation for these fluctuations. The budget was just $58,522 in 1998 ($ in dollars), but $295,998 in 2003 ($ in dollars) and $279,990 in 2007 ($ in dollars). The river's popularity, however, was increasing rapidly. Although the number of permit applications had hovered between 5,000 and 7,000 a year during most of the 1990s and early 2000s, they began increasing steadily in 2010 and reached an all-time high of 9,365 in 2015. The super permit Pursuant to the 2009 management plan, FWP began considering new rules governing the Smith River Recreational Waterway in 2010. Two of these proved highly controversial. One required anyone who received a float permit to wait one year before applying for another permit. Although the rule was designed to ensure more people enjoyed the river, members of the public said it was unfair to those who had to cancel. The second proposal would require anyone using the new Deep Creek boat camp to pack out their human waste. The agency was forced to extend the comment period from 30 to 45 days to accommodate the controversy these two proposals engendered. Far less controversial was the proposal to create a new \\"super permit\\" lottery. Under this scheme, members of the public would be able to purchase, for $5 ($ in dollars), an unlimited number of chances to win a single permit to float any day they wanted during the float season. The agency proposed a permit fee increase, and a minimum age of 12 for permit applicants. All but the human waste rule were approved. (The Super Permit lottery went into effect in 2013.) In 2010, FWP officials also approved a plan to restore westslope cutthroat trout to the Smith River. The plan involved poisoning other trout species in the upper Smith River drainage, and then introducing cutthroat in two locations a year later. The success of the plan would be assessed several years later, once the cutthroat had a chance to take hold. By 2014, there were five populations of nonhybridized westslope cutthroat trout in the Smith River watershed. In 2012, the Smith River saw a 19 percent increase in visitation, from 3,794 visitors to 4,515 visitors. Bear problems A black bear in Montana. As FWP began its biennial rulemaking for all state parks in late 2012, it considered requiring Smith River users to use bear-proof food storage methods. Although the agency said it was not proposing a rule, it wanted public comment on the issue, which some members of the public and some outfitters considered burdensome. \\"Food-conditioned\\" black bears (those used to scavenging for food around humans, and not afraid of human contact) were becoming more common near the Smith River as permanent developments increased, and the agency expressed concern that these bears might begin to seek out food at boat camps. FWP's concerns proved correct. In July 2013, the agency closed the Smith River to all users for six days on July 6, 2013, after a black bears entered several boat camps on the Smith River while human beings slept. Although no one was injured, permits for the six days were canceled and eight bears captured and relocated. Total users decreased 3 percent in 2013 to 4,399 due to the closure. User fees brought in $165,000 ($ in dollars), almost enough to cover the park's $185,000 ($ in dollars) annual operating cost. Despite the closure, FWP did not implement new rules to require bear-proof food containment in 2014, as staff had recommended. Instead, the agency purchased food storage boxes for placement at leased boat camps on private land, ordered all floaters to close food containers with straps and to pack out certain food waste (such as bacon grease), and issued a new floater education pamphlet about how to avoid bear problems. But with bear activity continuing, by the end of 2015 the agency began a rulemaking to implement mandatory bear-proof food and waste storage. The new rules went into effect in the 2016 float season, and the food lockers were removed from the boat camps. CEA dispute Little CEA money had been spent by 2011. However, in 2012, FWP approved bank stabilization, channel maintenance, and fencing in two places on the Smith River to help restore and improve areas were erosion threatened the fishery. The total cost of the two projects was $38,000 ($ in dollars). FWP began working with private landowners to implement the projects (although implementation had not occurred by late 2013). In 2013, the Montana chapter of Trout Unlimited exposed misuse of the Smith River Corridor Enhancement Account. FWP had used $107,301 ($ in dollars) in CEA funds to build a $43,390 maintenance/storage building, $8,850 for road maintenance, $3,430 for recycling containers, and $51,631 for replacement latrines and installation of a kiosk. The nonprofit conservation group argued that the expenditures had been approved without public input or notice, and that they violated the 2005 law governing use of the CEA. FWP agreed to replay the cost of the recycling containers and half of the cost of the maintenance/storage building (about $25,000 ($ in dollars)) to the CEA fund. By late fall of 2016, the CEA contained more than $400,000 ($ in dollars), despite the projects approved in 2012 and 2013. In 2014, the Lee and Donna Metcalf Charitable Foundation commissioned native Montana artist Monte Dolack to paint one of Montana's state parks in honor of the 75th anniversary of the park system's founding. Dolack, who had floated the Smith River 24 years earlier, floated the Smith during a supermoon event and created a new work, Smith River in June. Prints of the painting were made, and proceeds from sales of the prints went to the state park system. Dolack's painting hung in the Montana State Capitol through 2014.; Total users on the Smith River were 5,292 in 2014, a 20 percent increase. That year, the number of permit applications surpassed 8,000 for the first time. The number of permit applications surpassed 9,000 for the first time in 2015. The number of total users dropped 19 percent in 2015 to 4,289. 2015 and 2016 challenges In November 2012, Tintina Resources, a Canadian mining company, applied for a permit to mine the Johnny Lee Deposit, a copper lode the company believed was worth more than $2 billion ($ in dollars. The mine would be located from Sheep Creek, a major tributary near the headwaters of the Smith River. Environmentalists and sportsmen strongly opposed the mine, and Tintina amended its application several times between 2012 and 2017 to supply missing information or meet state requests for more data. The possibility that a mine so close to the river and below the local water table could exist led American Rivers, a clean water advocacy group, to declared the Smith River one of its ten \\"Most Endangered Rivers\\" in 2015 and again in 2016. In 2010, FWP began a cooperative effort with Montana State University to begin assessing the true size of the Smith River fishery. The project used \\"pit tags\\" to tag many fish species in the river and its major tributaries. Radiotelemetry stations placed along the Smith and these streams, as well as the Missouri River, tracked these fish as they moved through the watershed. More than 6,500 brown trout, burbot (aka ling), rainbow trout, suckers, and whitefish were pit tagged and 24,000 location recordings made by 2016. The data suggested that FWP needed to better protect areas where cool-water tributaries flowed into the warmer Smith River, as fish tended to congregate there during hot weather or when water flows were low. The research also identified tributaries where certain fish species tended to wander, suggesting that FWP work to target these streams for more intensive protection and management. At the end of 2016, FWP's new biennial rulemaking proposed restricting the size of homemade bear-proof containers, but did not seek to increase any user fees. The Smith River saw 4,607 total users in 2016, a 7 percent increase over the previous year. About the park The Smith River is a State Recreational Waterway. It is not technically a state park. As the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks noted in 1998, \\"The Smith River is a unique component of the state park system; it is more of a recreation management 'program,' than a park defined by specific geographic boundaries.\\" Nevertheless, the FWP often refers to the Smith River as a state park, and sometimes as the \\"Smith River State Park and River Corridor\\". Between Camp Baker and Eden Bridge, the Lewis & Clark National Forest owns approximately of the eastern shore and the Helena National Forest owns about of the western shore of the Smith River. The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) owns of land spread among 12 parcels in the area, although only one parcel has any shoreline. FWP leases these 12 parcels from the DNRC. FWP and USFS work cooperatively under the lead of the state to jointly manage the Smith River between Camp Baker and Eden Bridge. The border between Meagher and Cascade counties splits the Smith River Canyon downstream from Camp Baker. Under state law, the counties have planning, zoning, and development authority over private lands adjacent to the Smith River. Permits The Smith River is the only river in Montana where FWP has the legislative authority to manage social conflict. It is also the only river in the state where a permit is required to boat on the river. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks runs a lottery every late winter in which permits are awarded on a random basis to applicants. About 1,000 permits are issued each year. Float parties (recreational or outfitter-run) are limited to 15 people, and only nine launches are permitted each day. FWP also runs a \\"Super Permit\\" lottery, which permits the holder to launch on any day of their choosing. Members of the public may purchase as many \\"Super Permit\\" lottery tickets as they wish. Put-in, boat camps, and take-out FWP owns of land, split among 13 different parcels, between Fort Logan and the Smith River's confluence with the Missouri River. The state also claims title to the riverbed of the Smith River, and manages the waters of the river under the Montana Stream Access Law and various state supreme court rulings. Camp Baker is the river's only put-in (launch) site. It consists of a facility containing a three-bedroom, seasonally-occupied house for staff, a two-room ranger station, a two-story storage/maintenance building, an informational kiosk, two vault toilets, a parking lot for about 50 vehicles, boat launch ramps, and a camping area with picnic tables and fire grates. Access to the river is highly restricted by geography and private ownership of approximately 80 percent of the both banks. However, limited public access is provided by the Lewis & Clark National Forest at mid-canyon via Trail #309, Trail #310, Trail #311, and Trail #331. Twenty privately owned, primitive, seasonally-available roads also provide access at the landowner's discretion. As of 2009, there were 52 public boat camps between Camp Baker and Eden Bridge. Each boat camp features wooden post tie-ups, a fire ring and grate, and a pit latrine. Of the boat camps, 28 are on USFS land, 14 are on FWP land, nine are on private lands leased by FWP, and one is on DNRC land leased by FWP. FWP leases four parcels totaling to provide the nine boat camps on private land. Eden Bridge is the river's only take-out site. It consists of a facility containing a graveled boat take-out area, a single vault toilet, a storage shed, and a hardened area with electricity for volunteer hosts. There are also three campsites on unhardened ground, each with a fire ring and grate. Overnight camping is not permitted at Eden Bridge (except for the volunteer host) from mid-April to late July. Features of the Smith River corridor Between Camp Baker and Eden Bridge, the Smith River remains in semi-primitive state. There are four working ranches, a guest ranch, a hunting ranch, and two subdivisions (each with several seasonally- occupied homes) on land adjacent to the river, although as of 2009 much development was hidden from view by the geography if the canyon or vegetation. The Smith River Recreational Waterway flows through the Smith Canyon, a deep limestone canyon. Rocks in the canyon are from the Cambrian, Devonian, and Carboniferous periods of the Paleozoic era, and the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods of the Mesozoic era. Geologic formations such as folds and faults can be seen throughout the canyon. The Smith River is an excellent sport fishery. Sport fish include brown trout, rainbow trout, and whitefish. Other species widely fished in the area include brook trout, burbot (also known as ling), and cutthroat trout. Non-game fish which may also be caught include longnose dace, longnose sucker, mottled sculpin, mountain sucker, stonecat, and white sucker. Nonnative carp were present as late as 1995, but have been removed as of 2009. Wildlife occupying the Smith River canyon and surrounding area include black bear, cougar, dusky grouse, elk, mule deer, pheasant, raccoon, sharp-tailed grouse, sooty grouse, spruce grouse, and white-tailed deer. Hunting is permitted on state and federal lands, pursuant to hunting seasons and other regulations. A wide range of cultural sites occur in the Smith River canyon as well. All of these are Native American in origin. A number of prehistoric campsites, many of which contain tipi rings, exist in the canyon and its adjacent lands. Along the river are many pictograph (or \\"rock art\\") sites, which include tally-marks, animal and human figures, and geometric and abstract designs. These pictographs are generally either charcoal or iron oxide mixed with a binder such as berry juice, blood, fat, plant juice, or water. One survey, completed in 1994, logged 68 separate pictograph sites in the canyon, some of which were dated to 1,200 to 1,400 years old. Some of these sites are considered sacred to Native Americans, and most are located on private land. By law, cultural sites should not be touched, altered, removed, or vandalized.

Its initial focus was on county councils but its remit later covered other local government roles such as school boards. History The organisation emerged from a local electors association formed by Amelia Charles, Caroline Biggs, Mrs Evans and Lucy Wilson at the instigation of Annie Leigh Browne. This group's ambition was to get women into church politics.Jane Martin, ‚ÄòBrowne, Annie Leigh (1851‚Äì1936)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 14 Jan 2017 In November 1888 the Society for Promoting the Return of Women as County Councillors was formed by twelve women at Sarah Amos's house. The group included Elizabeth Lidgett and her sister Mary Bunting and it was led by Annie Leigh Browne. It was deciding suitable women candidates for election. Lidgett was offered the opportunity of standing to be a London County Councillor in 1889 but she refused. Annie Leigh Browne provided early funding and she, Eva McLaren, the Marchioness of Aberdeen, Louisa Temple Mallett and Newnham College founder Millicent Garret Fawcett were key members. In 1893 it changed its name to the Women's Local Government Society, reflecting the members wish to encourage women to be involved in every branch of politics and not exclusively in county councils. The aim of this society was to get women elected to local government. An early victory was the election of two women, Jane Cobden and Lady Margaret Sandhurst, to the London County Council. This was possible because of the wording of the Local Government Act 1888 which did not disqualify women candidates. A later court case determined that this was a mistake. Campaigns were unsuccessfully started to reverse the court's interpretation. However, in 1894 new legislation did allow women to stand for more minor roles. In 1894 Emma Maitland was elected to the London School Board to represent Chelsea and she took a special interest in the education offered to children who were blind or deaf.Jane Martin, ‚ÄòMaitland , Emma Knox (1844‚Äì1923)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 accessed 11 Jan 2017 School boards were abolished by the Education Act 1902, which replaced them with local education authorities; the Women's Local Government Society defended the rights of women to serve on the new authorities, arguing this was a step backwards as they had been contributing to school boards since the 1870s. The publication of the Qualification of Women (County and Borough Councils) Act in 1907 was a victory for the Women's Local Government Society.

The genus contains one species, G. ballmanni, named by Meijer in 2014. Its enormous size is thought to have been an adaptation to living in exposed, open areas with no terrestrial predators, and as a deterrent to the indigenous aerial predators like the eagle Garganoaetus and the giant barn owl Tyto gigantea. Description Life reconstruction of Garganornis The tibiotarsus of Garganornis is approximately 30% larger than that of the living mute swan in circumference. Based on comparisons with the latter, it has been estimated that Garganornis had a weight in the range of , larger than any living anatid. This suggests that it was likely flightless. The preserved carpometacarpi from the wings had quite a short and robust shaft, much shorter than any of the living large-bodied anseriforms that are capable of flight. The carpometacarpus was also peculiarly flattened on its top end; and the trochlea carpalis (a bony articular process that drives wing extension and flexion) is reduced and weak in shape, limiting wrist movement - both likely adaptations to a flightless lifestyle. In some specimens of Garganornis, there is a small bony knob on the top of the carpometacarpus that is similar to that of swans, geese, ducks, and other anseriforms; this was likely used for fighting, as in other members of the group. Likewise short and robust was the tarsometatarsus of the foot. The processes known as the trochlea metatarsi II and IV, on the bottom portion of the tarsometatarsus, are more equal in length than most other anseriforms, with the exception of the Cape Barren goose, screamers, and the giant, extinct Cygnus falconeri. The phalanx bones of the toes are also relatively robust, and similar to other giant anseriforms; however, the impressions of ligaments on the bones are weaker and less defined. Discovery and naming Map of Italy showing location of Gargano and Scontrone localities The first remains of Garganornis were discovered from the Posticchia 5 fissure filling near the town of Apricena in Gargano, Italy. These deposits are part of the Miocene Mikrotia faunal assemblage (named after an abundant murid rodent), which has been dated to 6‚Äì5.5 Ma in age. The holotype consists of a single partial left tibiotarsus, catalogued as RGM 443307, which was described by Meijer in 2014. Additional material was later described from Gargano by Pavia et al. in 2016, consisting of partial carpometacarpi (DSTF-GA 49, NMA 504/1801), a single damaged tibiotarsus (DSTF-GA 77), partial tarsometatarsi (RGM 425554, RGM 425943), and various phalanx bones from the foot (MGPT-PU 135356, RGM 261535, RGM 261945). Additionally, some geologically earlier but morphologically comparable material was described from the Scontrone locality, which is close to the town of Scontrone and has been dated to 9 Ma in age. This material consists of an almost complete tarsometatarsus, SCT 23; although it is temporally separated from the other material, the morphology and unusually large size of the bone suggests that it pertains to Garganornis. The genus name Garganornis is derived from the general area of Gargano, in which the holotype fossils were discovered; the Greek suffix ornis means \\"bird\\". The species name honors Peter Ballmann, who first described the birds of the Gargano region. Classification Several characteristics of the tibiotarsus allow Garganornis to be placed definitely in the order Anseriformes: the medial condyle is angled medially and bears a projection at its front end; and the canal of the extensor tendon is placed centrally over the intercondylar fossa. Features of the carpometacarpus allow for a more specific assignment to the family Anatidae: the extensor process is parallel to the trochlea carpalis and is not tilted towards the bottom; the pisiform process is wide and unpointed; and a small knob is present above the caudal carpal fovea. Garganornis peculiarly shares a number of characteristics in the tibiotarsus with another group of large anseriforms, the Gastornithidae. In particular, the intercondylar fossa is wide, the bottom opening of the extensor canal is circular (although it is placed more centrally relative to the condyles than in gastornithids), the extensor sulcus is relatively deep, and the pons supratendineus (a projection above the opening of the extensor canal) has a depression on its side. However, given that gastornithids and other Paleogene fauna do not appear to have survived in - or even reached - this region, it is more likely that these shared traits are convergent adaptations to gigantic body sizes. Paleoecology Mammals of the Mikrotia fauna: Hoplitomeryx (A) and Deinogalerix (B, to scale with Erinaceus europaeus, the European hedgehog) Surveys conducted by P. Ballmann in the 1970s revealed a diverse bird fauna in the Gargano locality, consisting of 16 different taxa; later work established the presence of 10 additional distinct taxa (not including Garganornis), bringing the total to 26. These include the anatids Anas cf. velox and an additional unnamed anatid; the giant eagles Garganoaetus freudenthali and G. murivorus, as well as an unnamed smaller accipitrid; the phasianid Palaeortyx volans; the owls Tyto robusta, T. gigantea, \\"Strix\\" perpasta, another species referred to Strix, an additional species referred to Athene, and an unnamed taxon formerly referred to T. sanctialbani; the pigeon Columba omnisanctorum; the swift Apus wetmorei; the sandpipers Calidris sp. and an unnamed taxon; a threskiornithid; a woodpecker; a songbird; two rails; two charadriiforms; a bustard; a mousebird; and a corvid. To date, Garganornis is the only bird that is found in both the Gargano and Scontrone localities; the lack of other Gargano birds in Scontrone is probably a result of taphonomic bias. Asides from birds, various mammals and reptiles are known from the Gargano and Scontrone localities. Most notably, the giant murid Mikrotia (including M. magna, M. parva, and M. maiuscula) is very abundant; the genus lends its name to the entire local ecosystem, which has become known as the Mikrotia fauna. A second murid, Apodemus sp., is also present. Other rodents include the giant dormice Stertomys laticrestatus, S. daunius, and S. lyrifer, along with the smaller species S. deguili, S. simplex, and S. daamsi; and the hamsters Hattomys gargantua, H. nazarii, Neocricetodon sp., and Apocricetus sp. The gymnures (hairy hedgehogs) Deinogalerix freudenthalli, D. minor, D. intermedius, D. brevirostris, D. koenigswaldi, and D. masinii were also giant, while their smaller relative Apulogalerix cf. pusillus is also present. Other mammals include the crocidosoricine shrew Lartetium cf. dehmi; the pikas Prolagus apricenicus and P. imperialis; the deer-like hoplitomerycid Hoplitomeryx mathei; and the otter Paralutra garganensis. There is one reptile genus: a crocodile referred to Crocodylus. Garganornis and the rest of the Mikrotia fauna has been dated to the Tortonian stage of the Late Miocene. During the Miocene, the Gargano and Scontrone areas were part of an isolated archipelago that has been referred to as the Apulia-Abruzzi Palaeobioprovince. Small mammals, including the gymnure ancestors of Deinogalerix, probably reached these islands via rafting.

Green industrial policy is necessary for the reasons that green industries such as renewable energy and low-carbon public transportation infrastructure are faced with high costs and many risks in terms of market economy, and therefore, they need support from the public sector in the form of industrial policy until they become commercially viable.Koh, Jae Myong (2018). Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects. London: Palgrave Macmillan. . Natural scientists warn that immediate action must be taken to lower greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. Social scientists argue that the mitigation of climate change requires state intervention and governance reform.Schmitz et al. 2015, p. 812. Thus, governments use GIP to address the economic, political, and environmental issues of climate change. GIP is conducive to sustainable economic, institutional, and technological transformation. It goes beyond the free market economic structure to address market failures and commitment problems that hinder sustainable investment. Effective GIP builds political support for carbon regulation which is necessary to transition towards a low-carbon economy. Several governments use different types of GIP that lead to various outcomes. GIP and industrial policy are similar, although GIP has unique challenges and goals. GIP faces the particular challenge of reconciling economic and environmental issues. It deals with a high degree of uncertainty about green investment profitability. Furthermore, it addresses the reluctance of industry to invest in green development, and it helps current governments influence future climate policy.Karp & Stevenson 2012, p. 1. GIP offers opportunities for energy transition to renewables and a low-carbon economy. A large challenge for climate policy is a lack of industry and public support. GIP creates benefits that attract support for sustainability. It can create strategic niche management and generate a \\"green spiral\\", or a process of feedback that combines industrial interests with climate policy. GIP can protect employees in emerging and declining industries, which leads to political support for other climate policy. Carbon pricing, sustainable energy transitions, and decreases in greenhouse gas emissions have higher chances of success as political support increases. GIP faces many risks. Some risks include poor government choices about which industries to support; political capture of economic policy; wasted resources; ineffective action to combat climate change; poor policy design that lacks policy objectives and exit strategies; trade disputes; and coordination failure.Meckling et al., 2015; Rodrik, 2014; Hallegatte et al., 2013. Strategic steps can be taken to manage the risks of GIP. Some include public and private sector communication, transparency, and accountability; policy with clear objectives, evaluation techniques and exit strategies; policy learning and policy experimentation; green rent management; strong institutions; and a free press.Meckling et al., 2015; Rodrik, 2014; Schmitz et al. 2015; Hallegatte et al., 2013. Governments in various countries, states, provinces, territories, and cities use different types of green industrial policy. Distinct policy instruments lead to several outcomes. Examples include sunrise and sunset policies, subsidies, research and development, local content requirements, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, export restrictions, consumer mandates, green public procurement rules, and renewable portfolio standards.  Versus industrial policy  GIP and industrial policy (IP) have similarities. Both seek to promote the development of industries and the creation of new technology. Each involves government intervention in the economy to address economic issues and market failures. Both use similar policy approaches, like research and development subsidies and tax credits. Each faces comparable risks like implementation failure that occurs when the government fails to monitor the policy adequately.Hallegatte et al. 2013, p. 5. Additionally, the two are related because policymakers can use information from past IP when they design and implement GIP. Policy learning and lesson drawing that studies the failures and successes of IP can be applied to GIP to lower its risks.Hallegatte et al. 2013, p. 6. For example, an important lesson from IP is that what works for one region will not necessarily work for another, so policy cannot be directly adopted from a different region because it must address an area's local context to ensure success. The two approaches have many things in common. However, GIP differs significantly from IP because it addresses environmental concerns, whereas IP does not. The current economy focuses on private benefits, such as immediate profitability, rather than social benefits, such as reducing pollution. Since green investment has less private benefits than social benefits, GIP deals with a unique commitment problem.Karp & Stevenson 2012, p. 2. The profitability of green investments is highly uncertain, so firms are reluctant to invest. As a result, governments use GIP to promote green investments. Furthermore, future environmental policy success, like carbon taxation policy, hinges on the future availability of renewable energy. Current investment is the only way to ensure future availability, and GIP addresses this fact. Efficient and accessible green technology will also make it politically easier to adopt future low-carbon policies.Karp & Stevenson 2012, p. 11. Thus, a transition towards a low-carbon economy depends on current investment, and as such, it depends on GIP.  Energy transitions  The persistence of a carbon-based economy has led to environmentally destructive path dependency, and energy transitions are vital to divert from the reliance. Strategic niche management (SNM) offers an opportunity for energy transitions. New, sustainable technologies cannot immediately compete on the market with existing, unsustainable technologies due to path dependency. Green innovations that are not immediately profitable are vital for inducing sustainable development and achieving societal goals of mitigating climate change. Thus, governments must create technological niches, and use forms of GIP to subsidise and nurture technological niches to ensure that green innovations develop.Schot & Geels 2008, p. 537. Technical niches provide protected space for innovative sustainable development that co-evolves with user practices, regulatory structures, and technology.Schot & Geels 2008, p. 538. Co-evolutionary dynamics are necessary for successful niche innovation; multiple actors from multiple layers must work together for sustainable transitions. Social networks are essential for niche development because numerous stakeholders lead to many points of view, more commitment and resources, and more innovation.Schot & Geels 2008, p. 541. Sustainable urbanisation models in cities are examples of SNM. Municipal governments and social networks help create small-scale testing spaces that allow for technological and social innovation, such as developing electric car technology and encouraging car-sharing. Overall, electric cars have not become a norm in the automobile industry. However, if a technological niche successfully emerges in the market, it can transform into a market niche, and solidify its place in the industry and the socio-technical regime. In turn, the regime, or industry, influences the landscape, which can change the economic climate and induce sustainable energy transitions. Therefore, SNM and GIP can break path dependency and solidify the place of green technologies in markets and society. Green industrial policy can induce a green spiral and can also break path dependence. Economists view carbon pricing as the most compelling approach to the mitigation of climate change, but their opinion ignores the political cost of radical adoption of carbon pricing and its lack of political feasibility.Meckling et al. 2015, p. 1170. As a result, immediate adoption of carbon pricing often fails, and carbon pricing schemes are often designed to adapt to demands of the polluters, which makes them ineffective. Green industrial policy addresses the issue of a lack of political feasibility. Green spiral means GIP and carbon pricing approaches are most effective when they are produced in a sequence to increase climate policy support over time. GIP contributes to the growth of a political landscape of coalitions and interests, such as renewable energy firms and investors, that benefit from energy transformation. Those alliances and interests generate political support for GIP, even when unsustainable industries may oppose it. Furthermore, they become political allies during the development of stricter climate policy that negatively affects polluters. Thus, GIP creates positive feedback. Early GIP helps green industries expand, and the more they expand, the more support increases for decarbonised energy systems, and the easier it becomes to apply stricter climate policy, such as carbon pricing. A green spiral makes sustainability feasible, attractive, and profitable for industries, which encourages the adoption of sustainable business techniques. For example, feed-in tariffs create direct incentives for the growth of green industry groups and can push sustainable changes in investment and revenues. Changes create support for policy and technology experimentation and induce progress towards system-wide transformation.Meckling et al. 2015, p. 1171. A green spiral can create energy transitions to renewables and lower the political costs of transitions.  Environmental benefits  GIP does not immediately create a radical transformation to a green economy, but it represents practical steps towards it, and energy transitions are one of its primary goals. Without government intervention in the economy, it is unlikely that the current market will transition towards a low-carbon economy. GIP also increases political support for further climate policy. Therefore, GIP has the potential for environmental benefits. Green technologies emit fewer greenhouse gases (GHG) and use fewer resources or economise on renewable resources.Rodrick 2014, p. 469. A majority of natural scientists agree that an enormous reduction in GHGs is essential to mitigate the effects of climate change, such as a rise in global temperatures, droughts, floods, extreme weather events, diseases, food shortages, and species extinction.Stern, 2006. Since GIP can reduce GHG emissions, it can protect the environment, and in turn, it can preserve the health, safety, and security of humans and other species. Not all green industrial policies are successful in achieving a reduction in emissions, but some form of failure is inevitable within the policy and economic realms, and governments learn from failures to improve future policy.Rodrik 2014, p. 481. Immediate action is needed to address climate change and protect the environment, and GIP offers the tools to do so.  Worker benefits  GIP creates sunrise policies and sunset policies that produce benefits for employees. Sunrise policies aim to set up and develop new technologies or grow green sectors.Hallegatte et al. 2013, p. 8. The policies create new employment opportunities in green industries. For example, GIP, such as investment in research and development, helped develop the renewable energy sector in Germany. GIP led to a booming German renewable energy industry that employs over 371,000 people, which is double the number of jobs available in 2004. Investment in innovation can also increase economic growth, which can create further benefits, such as job availability, job stability, and increased salaries. Sunset policies support declining industries to allow for a smooth economic transition away from energy-intensive industries towards sustainable ones.Hallegate et al. 2013, p. 12. Sunset policies are expensive, but they are often a requirement for the political acceptability of energy transitions.Hallegatte et al. 2013, p. 12. Examples include retraining schemes for workers in declining industries, funding to adjust production technologies to make them more sustainable, and social safety nets such as unemployment insurance. GIP is beneficial for both the environment and workers, which creates political support for climate policy and makes energy transitions just and feasible.  Risks  Proponents and sceptics of GIP acknowledge that it involves numerous risks. Arguments against GIP state that governments cannot make practical choices about which firms or industries to support, and subsequently, they will make mistakes and waste valuable resources.Rodrik 2014, p. 472. Additionally, GIP raises concerns about rent-seeking and regulatory capture. Government intervention in markets can create rent-seeking behaviour (or the manipulation of policy to increase profits), so GIP may become driven by political concerns rather than economic ones. Subsidies are particularly prone to rent-seeking as special interests may lobby intensely to maintain subsidies, even when they are no longer needed, while taxpayers who may be interested in abolishing subsidies are dispersed and have fewer resources.Cosbey 2013, p. 8. Political capture of economic policy leads to a reluctance to abandon a failing or expensive policy, and if rent-seeking occurs, a policy is bound to be ineffective, which will waste resources. Inadequate policy design can also lead to the failure of GIP. If a policy does not have clear objectives, benchmarks to measure success, close monitoring, and exit strategies, it has too many risks, and will likely fail. For instance, in California, United States, Solyndra, an energy efficiency firm, was partially funded by the U.S. government. The funding came from poorly planned policy, and it experienced political capture, which led to its failure. Furthermore, GIP is not an immediate solution, so sceptics argue that it constitutes ineffective action to address climate change, and more must be done. Trade disputes are another risk. GIP created a new strand of trade and environment conflicts within the World Trade Organization (WTO). For example, policies with local content requirements have induced several trade disputes. Finally, coordination failure is a significant risk, as green innovation requires inter-agency, inter-sectoral, and public-private coordination, which can be difficult to produce, and requires strong institutions.Hallegatte et al. 2013, p. 11. Thus, there are several potential issues of GIP, but there are ways to address the risks.  Addressing risks  While proponents of GIP discuss several ways to mitigate risks, it is important to note that some instances of targeting the wrong firms or industries are inevitable because some degree of failure is inherent in GIP effort. Profit cannot measure success, but rather, success occurs with the creation of environmental and technological externalities.Rodrik 2014, p. 482. Governments can take several steps to lower risks and ensure success. For example, they can make sufficient choices about which industries or companies to support to avoid failure. Governments can also avoid using the wrong policy instruments if they experiment in select parts of the country before applying policy country- wide.Schmitz et al. 2015, p. 827. Policy learning and lesson drawing from industrial policy and GIP can foster the adoption of correct policy instruments. Rent-seeking can be an issue, but the creation of rent attracts investors into risky green technology fields.Schmitz et al. 2015, p. 813. Rent management can avoid the problem by dictating the correct amount of profit, appropriately offering profit incentives, and withdrawing them when markets can function on their own. Governments must also work with the private sector, and the two should have a mutual interest and understanding of the issues each seeks to address, although governments must avoid capture by the private sector.Schmitz et al. 2015, p. 817. Independent monitoring of policy progress, strong institutions, consumer protection agencies, and a free press can deal with the risk of political capture. Furthermore, clear objectives, consistent monitoring, evaluation techniques, and exit strategies can strengthen policies.Rodrik 2014, p. 486-487. Policies can avoid trade disputes through the process of policy learning and by adhering to WTO rules. Policymakers can also evade ineffective GIP through the creation of a transparent and accountable political coalition of actors, which includes public-private partnerships, business alliances, and civil society. A strong coalition also addresses coordination failures.Schmitz et al. 2015, p. 828.Rodrik 2014, p. 485. The extra risks of GIP options could avoid future costs by increasing progress toward more ambitious cuts in emissions. As a result, GIP that is politically optimal may be economically optimal in the long-run, even if it experiences immediate inefficiencies.  Examples  The following section includes examples of GIP.  Subsidies  Subsidies help offset the private costs of green investments. Subsidies for a targeted sector are the most common form of GIP.Wu & Salzman 2015, p. 419. The WTO defines three types of government subsidies. The first is governments transfers or private transfers mandated by the government that create budgetary outlays. The second is programs that provide goods or services below cost. The third is regulatory policies which create transfers from one person or group to another. The International Energy Agency predicts that subsidies for green energy will expand to almost $250 billion in 2035, compared to $39 billion in 2007. Subsidies have directly contributed to the growth of renewable energy industries. The positive benefits have spread globally as the cost of renewables has steadily declined.Wu & Salzman 2015, p. 420. The WTO has rules that constrain subsidies to avoid rent-seeking.  Research and development  Research and development (R&D;) is an essential GIP instrument because it generates green technologies. An example of green R&D; is the scientific agency United States Geological Survey (USGS), which is a part of the United States government. It receives government funding for the USGS Climate R&D; Program, which seeks to mitigate the complex issues of climate change. Another example is the Program of Energy Research and Development, which is run by the Canadian federal government. It provides R&D; funding for federal departments and agencies, such as Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Transport Canada. The departments and agencies are encouraged to collaborate with the private sector, international organisations, universities, and provincial and municipal governments. The objective of the program is to create a sustainable energy future.  Local content requirements  Local content requirements (LCRs) mean that in the production process, producers must obtain a certain minimum percentage of goods, labour, or services from local sources. Ontario, Canada passed legislation with local content requirements in 2009 called the Green Energy and Green Economy Act. Its objectives were to expand renewable energy production and use, promote the conservation of energy, and create new green employment.Stephenson 2013, p. 15. The Act required Ontario-made content in renewable electricity generators, such as wind and solar farms, for the generators to be eligible for government subsidies. It created many jobs, lowered GHG emissions, and vastly expanded the renewable energy industry in Ontario.Stephenson 2013, pp. 16-17. Japan and the European Union disputed the requirements, and the WTO ruled that Ontario must remove LCRs from the Act.Stephenson 2013, p. 13. The trade dispute and its WTO decision had adverse effects in Ontario, as support for green innovation declined, and worldwide, as many countries that used LCRs in successful GIP learned that LCRs violate WTO regulations.Stephenson 2013, p. 23.  Feed-in tariffs  Feed-in tariffs (FITs) are a series of policies that create long-term financial encouragement for renewable energy generation. There are different versions of FITs. One version provides a fixed price for renewables, and the price is usually higher than the market rate for non-renewable energy. The fixed price guarantee counteracts the increased costs that renewable energy producers experience. Moreover, the elimination of a cost disadvantage encourages investment and innovation. Germany's FIT approach has received worldwide acclaim as it transformed Germany into a renewable energy leader.  Tax credits and incentives  There are several green tax credits available for individuals and businesses to create financial incentives for eco-conscious actions. Several countries have tax credits for electric vehicles, including Canada, the United States, Australia, and countries in Europe. In the United States, Internal Revenue Code Section 30D provides a tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles, and the total amount of credit available is $7,500. In Belgium, the registration fee for vehicles does not apply to electric cars and plug-in hybrids. Additionally, corporations with zero-emissions automobiles have a deductibility rate of 120 percent. Several other European countries have exemptions from car-related taxes, including Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.  Export restrictions  Export restrictions involve inhibiting exports of a resource with the objective of increasing competitiveness of a domestic industry that relies on the resource.Wu & Salzman 2015, p. 426. The limits use taxes or quotas, or a combination of them. China restricted the export of minerals and rare earth elements and argued that restrictions constrain production, which decreases environmental harm.Wu & Salzman 2015, p. 427. The limitations are for China's economic benefit, but extracting and refining the resources indeed causes environmental damage, so the policy does protect the environment. However, export restrictions can distort the trade market and negatively affect foreign consumers, which can lead to WTO challenges.  Mandates  Renewable energy mandates require that companies or consumers produce or sell a certain amount of energy from renewables. Australia's Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme is an incentive for individual citisens and small-scale businesses to install renewable energy systems, such as rooftop solar systems.Schnittger & Fisher 2017, p. 5. Its Large-scale Renewable Energy Target requires an increase in annual renewable electricity generation. Of the power that electricity retailers provide, 12.75 percent of it must be renewable to be eligible for subsidies. Australian electricity consumers pay for the subsidies that support the scheme.Schnittger & Fisher 2017, p. 3. Some argue that the environmental benefits of renewables do not make up for the rise in electricity costs and that more needs to be done to make renewable energy accessible and affordable.  Green public procurement rules  Green public procurement (GPP) occurs when governments obtain goods, works, and services that are sustainable and environmentally friendly. Rules encourage the public sector to purchase green products and supplies, such as energy efficient computers, recycled paper, green cleaning services, electric vehicles, and renewable energy. Rules can be a driver for green innovation and can produce financial savings.European Commission 2016, p. 4. GPP can create economic growth and increase the sales of eco-industries.European Commission 2016, p. 5. An example of GPP is A Plan for Public Procurement in the United Kingdom. It encourages sustainable food procurement for the public sector and its suppliers, and it sets out a vision for specific targets and outcomes.European Commission 2016, p. 11. The policy addresses issues such as energy use, water and waste, seasonality, animal welfare, and fair trade.  Renewable portfolio standards  Renewable portfolio standards (RPS) are regulatory mandates that support increased production of renewables. Standards set a minimum amount for annual production of renewable energy. In Michigan, the United States, the 2016 Clean, Renewable and Efficient Energy Act requires that electric providers increase their supply of renewables from 10 percent in 2015 to 15 percent in 2021, with an interim requirement of 12.5 percent in 2019 and 2020. In the United States, state-level RPS have driven the development of renewable energy. RPS-motivated development accounted for 60 percent of American new renewable development in 2012.Johnson & Novacheck 2015, p. 5324.

In about 1310 the east window of the chancel was inserted and at least two of the windows in the south wall of the chancel were enlarged in the Decorated Gothic style. At the end of the 14th century the north aisle was added, linked with the nave by an arcade of four bays. The large Perpendicular Gothic window in the middle of the south wall of the chancel was inserted in the 15th century, replacing the Norman original. The south porch was added in 1630, the clerestorey was added to the nave in 1636 and the north arcade was probably rebuilt in the same century. The bell tower was built in 1725, probably replacing an earlier one. The west gallery was inserted in 1735. The church was restored and the north porch added in 1871. By 1854 the tower had a ring of six bells, of which the two oldest were cast in 1638 and the remainder in 1679, 1683, 1729 and 1854. The bells were increased to a ring of eight,The Gloucester & Bristol Diocesan Association of Church Bell Ringers: North Cotswold Branch and in 2016 an appeal was launched to replace the bell frame and to increase the number of bells to ten.

He entered the industry in 2005 when he was selected by an agency to work in the U.S. market. He is known for the Kirby Genesis series in which he has worked with the best- selling and Eisner award winners, Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross and for his contributions to various Dynamite and DC Comics titles.  Early life  Jack was born on February 28, 1982 in Bananeiras, Para√≠ba where he lived a \\"typical middle-class childhood\\". He became interested in drawing from early childhood and at age of nine, an aunt showed him an interview with Mike Deodato in the local newspaper, what caused him great impact because Deodato also lived in Para√≠ba and drew for the great American publishers. Jack explains, \\"And that's when I discovered that I could live with comics, work with comics. So it was from there that I came to believe.\\". At age 10, his family moved to Jo√£o Pessoa where he lives until now. In the 90's, he was first influenced by superheroes when he discovered Jim Lee's X-Men and the TV serie X-Men: Animated Series. He also would later be influenced by comics artists such as Mike Deodato, Lee Bermejo, Eduardo Risso, Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez, Frank Frazetta, Esad Ribic, John Buscema, Marc Silvestri and Olivier Coipel At age 18, he joined the group of designers of a local studio and began doing freelance commercial art jobs and participating in local art events.

In that same year, he joined the special Project Superpowers series plotted by Alex Ross and scripted by Joe Casey and illustrated Meet the Bad Guys #4 The Scarab Supremacy, colored by Marcelo Maiolo. = Red Sonja Series = In the early 2000s, Dynamite acquired the comic book rights to Red Sonja and decided to bring back Sonja's classic bikini armor for her new series, which debuted in 2005. The series was an immediate hit, becoming Dynamite's best-selling title and firmly returning Red Sonja to mainstream popularity. The character now has a monthly series, together with a series of mini-series and one-shots, all published by Dynamite Entertainment. The main Red Sonja series features a number of cover artists as well as the regular team of writer Michael Avon Oeming and artist Mel Rubi.

It was founded in 1952, and until 1981 was responsible for all research conducted in the country before various organizational reforms and splittings of academies were conducted. Since 1980s the Academy has suffered from a long-term lack of funding, but it remains as a large and the most important scientific institution in the country. The Academy has played a role in the nuclear weapons program of North Korea until a separate military-run Academy of National Defense Science was established to take on this role. History Preparations to found the Academy were begun in the spring of 1952, Alt URL and the Academy was founded on 1 December 1952. When the Academy was founded, it had 10 full and 15 candidate members in nine research institutes and 43 smaller research laboratories. Its first president was Hong Myng-hi who, according to Andrei Lankov, was not a skilled administrator and chosen for his political loyalty. Hong was followed by Paek Nam-un, who was more adept. The Academy initiated the nuclear weapons program of North Korea when in 1955 it sent representatives to a conference on peaceful uses of nuclear power in Eastern Europe. By the late 1950s, the Soviet Union was giving practical training in nuclear research to institutions affiliated with the North Korean Academy of Sciences. In 1957, the Soviets dispatched I. M. Gramenitsky to teach the Academy about thick-layered emulsion in nuclear physics. In 1959, North Korea struck a deal with the Soviet Union on setting up a nuclear research facility under the Academy near Yongbyon. A parallel development in the late 1950s was the purging of intellectuals unfavorable to Kim Il-sung from the Academy in 1957. In the aftermath of the August Faction Incident that sought to oust Kim the previous year, meeting to uncover and punish \\"factionalists\\" were organized at the Academy from August to November 1957. One of those purged was Yi Chong-won, \\"one of the founding fathers of Korean Marxist historiography\\". In the 1970s, a number of State Academy of Sciences institutes were moved from the Pyongyang to the city of Pyongsong, some outside of the capital. The headquarters of the Academy remained in Sosong District in central Pyongyang. There are now 17 such research institutions in Pyongsong, all of them part of the network of the Academy of Sciences. According to Lankov, the Academy does not exhibit \\"a hint of the intellectual, let alone political, independence\\" that academies in other countries, including the Soviet Academy of Sciences at times, have. On 11 January 1999, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il chose the Academy as his first location of on-the-spot guidance of the year, which he had declared the \\"year of sciences\\". According to Sung Chull Kim, \\"[i]t is unquestionable that this visit was more than a symbolic gesture\\" relating to Kim's strategy of prioritizing the information technology industry. Organization The Academy is the most important scientific institution in the country and is considerably large. The Academy reports directly to the Cabinet of North Korea. Under the Academy, there are various organizations and six publishing houses, including the Academy of Sciences Publishing House in the Central District of Pyongyang. The Academy issues books and some 40 periodicals. Kwahakwon Tongbo (Korean for \\"Bulletins of the Academy of Sciences\\"), is the organ of its standing committee and is published six times a year. Affiliated with the Academy, there are institutions dealing with various fields including mathematics and physics, chemistry, engineering, medicine, law and economics, history, literature and philology, and ethnography and archaeology. A biology research laboratory is under its direct control. Although there is a separate Academy of Social Sciences, there are social science institutes attached to the Academy of Sciences. Various committees work on linguistics, the compilation of classics, the compilation of technical terms, and language reform. An Academy of Koryo Medicine was founded under the Academy of Sciences in 1962 to study traditional Korean medicine. The Academy Headquarters is based in the Sosong District of Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. While some facilities of the Academy are located in Pyongyang, much of its activities actually take place in Pyongsong. Most of the facilities are located in Pyongyang's Unjong District, a district between the capital city's center and the city of Pyongsong. The North Korean government has plans to establish a special economic zone run by the Academy there. Pyongyang retains branches involved in the research of biology, construction and building materials, electronics and automation, and light industry. A branch exists in Hamhung, South Hamgyong Province. Between 1994 and 1998 it was briefly renamed the National Academy of Sciences. On 5 September 1999, the Academy merged with the State Commission for Science and Technology. Since the 1980s, the Academy has suffered from the lack of funds, and since the early 1990s, it and its personnel have experienced \\"a dramatic decline\\" in standing. Before that, positions in the Academy were much sought-after and could provide good wages, rations, and prestige. The Academy maintains websites, but they are only accessible through the North Korean Intranet. All science on the highest level was conducted by the single Academy of Sciences until 1981, when it was split into separate academies of the Academy of Social Sciences, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Academy of Medical Sciences, Academy of Light Industry, and the original Academy of Sciences. In 1992 the minor academies were merged with the Academy of Sciences, only to be split off again in 1998. A Second Academy of Natural Sciences, tasked with military science, remains separate. The Academy has 40 research institutes and 200 smaller research centers. It has 50,000 employees. Its current president Jang Chol, who was preceded by Pyon Yong-rip. The Academy is a member of the International Council for Science since 1961. The Academy operates a Special Economic Zone near Unjong Park in the northern suburbs of Pyongyang.

He played college football at Ohio State. Early years A resident of the Flanders section of Mount Olive Township, New Jersey, Brown attended Pope John XXIII Regional High School in Sparta, New Jersey. He missed his sophomore season after breaking his ribs in the first game. He had 41 receptions for 630 yards and six touchdowns as a junior. In his final year he recorded 41 receptions for 857 yards, 14 receiving touchdowns and 7 rushing touchdowns, helping his team reach the non-public league Group 3 final and receiving All-New Jersey honors by the Newark Star-Ledger. He committed to Ohio State University to play college football. He finished with over 3,000 all-purpose yards and 42 touchdowns, after playing at wide receiver, running back and kick returner. Recruitment Brown was a highly sought after prospect that received many offers from Virginia Tech, Notre Dame, Penn State, Michigan State, Pittsburgh, and USC. He had multiple visits to Columbus in 2013 and opted to shut down his recruiting early and commit to Ohio State five months before National Signing Day. College career Brown played in all 14 games, including the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship victory over Oregon, as a true freshman at Ohio State in 2014. He had one reception for nine yards and one run for a 4-yard loss, while playing wide receiver, H-back and special teams. The next year, he excelled in spring practice and was expected to earn the starting wide receiver job, until suffering a broken left tibia and fibula late in fall camp during a non-contact drill, forcing him to redshirt for the 2015 season. The injury was serious enough to require two separate surgeries. In 2016, Brown returned to start in all 13 games as a sophomore. He had 32 receptions (second on the team) for 402 yards and 7 touchdowns (tied for the team lead). In the third game against the University of Oklahoma, he tied a school record with 4 receiving touchdowns, while totaling 5 receptions for 72 yards. After the season, he decided to forgo his remaining two years of eligibility and enter the 2017 NFL Draft. Professional career On January 7, 2017, Brown announced via Twitter that he decided to forgo his senior season and enter the 2017 NFL Draft. Many analysts were surprised he decided to enter the draft and opt out of his last two years of remaining eligibility, due to his limited experience as a one-year starter and his low draft projection. He was one of 58 collegiate wide receivers to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. Brown chose to only perform the three-cone drill, short shuttle, and bench press. He tied for second in the bench press behind Shepherd's Billy Brown who had 23 reps, but ended up playing tight end in the NFL. On March 23, 2017, Brown attended Ohio State's pro day, along with Marshon Lattimore, Gareon Conley, Raekwon McMillan, Curtis Samuel, and five other prospects. He only performed the 40-yard dash, 20-yard dash, and 10-yard dash as scouts and team representatives from all 32 NFL teams looked on, including head coaches: Bill Belichick (Patriots), Mike Tomlin (Steelers), Hue Jackson (Browns), Mike Mularkey (Titans), Sean Payton (Saints), Jim Caldwell (Lions), and Marvin Lewis (Bengals). At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Brown was projected to be a fifth or sixth round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the 27th best wide receiver prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. The Dallas Cowboys selected Brown in the seventh round (239th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was the 31st wide receiver drafted in 2017 and was the second wide receiver selected by the Cowboys after North Carolina's Ryan Switzer. Dallas Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones stated that running back Ezekiel Elliott was the main reason they drafted Brown after Elliot continually advocated for him and convinced them he had a lot of talent to bring to the team. Brown was teammates with Elliot at Ohio State. 2017 On May 11, 2017, the Dallas Cowboys signed Brown to a four-year, $2.47 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $71,938. Throughout training camp, Brown competed for a roster spot as the fifth or sixth wide receiver on the Cowboys' depth chart. He competed against Brice Butler, Lucky Whitehead, Andy Jones, and Lance Lenoir. Head coach Jason Garrett named Brown the sixth wide receiver on the Cowboys' depth chart, behind Dez Bryant, Terrance Williams, Cole Beasley, Brice Butler, and Ryan Switzer. He made his professional regular season debut in the Cowboys' Week 2 42‚Äì17 loss at the Denver Broncos. The following week, he made his first career reception during the Cowboys' 28-17 victory at the Arizona Cardinals. His reception came off a pass by quarterback Dak Prescott and he gained 13 yards before being tackled by Tyrann Mathieu. On November 19, 2017, Brown caught a pass for a season-long 14 yards during a 37-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. On December 24, 2017, he earned his first career start as the Cowboys lost 21-12 to the Seattle Seahawks. He finished his rookie season with four receptions for 33 receiving yards in 13 games and one start. 2018 On September 3, 2018, Brown was placed on injured reserve after missing the preseason with a hamstring injury. He was activated off injured reserve on November 9 to the active roster. Noah was mostly used for his blocking abilities appearing in 8 games with 2 starts, registering 5 receptions for 54 yards total. 2019 Brown began training camp on the physically unable to perform list, because of an offseason left knee surgery. He was placed on the reserve list to start the season on August 31, 2019.

Notably he was the sole survivor of the Tonquin, a trading vessel owned by the Pacific Fur Company that was destroyed near Vancouver Island. He was hired to act an interpreter for the vessel in negotiations with various Nuu-chah-nulth peoples. Enraged at the prices that the Tla-o-qui-aht insisted upon, captain Jonathan Thorn struck an elder with a pelt. After purchasing PFC blades, the Tla-o-qui-aht attacked and killed the crew. Only Joseachal survived to reach Fort Astoria to inform the PFC officers of the Tonquin's destruction. The Tonquin Near Destruction Island he was recruited by Thorn to act as an interpreter. He had a sister married to a Tla-o-qui-aht man, a factor that has been attributed to his later survival on Vancouver Island. While at Clayoquot Sound in June 1811, the Tonquin hosted members of the neighboring Tla-o-qui- aht nation. They boarded the ship in large numbers to trade with commercial dealings negotiated between Thorn and an experienced elder, Nookamis, along with Joseachal translating their proposals. These discussions made Thorn increasingly frustrated at Nookamis' intransigence to accept his terms. Joseachal later informed Duncan McDougall that Thorn took one of Nookamis' fur skins and hit him in the face with it. After this outburst, the Indigenous consulted among themselves and offered to trade their fur stockpiles again. They proposed that in return for a skin, the PFC officers sell 3 blankets and a knife. McDougall recounted that \\"A brisk trade was carried on all the Indians setting round on the decks of the Ship were supplied with a knife a piece.\\" Violence immediately erupted as the warriors led by Wickaninnish attacked the crew on board, and killed all but one of the men. The only known survivor of the crew was Joseachal, who arrived back at Fort Astoria through assistance of prominent Lower Chinookan noble Comcomly.

It is west of Siskiyou Pass and south-southeast of Ashland along Colestin Road, which connects to Interstate 5 via Mount Ashland Road. Colestin is adjacent to part of the Klamath National Forest in the Siskiyou Mountains. The community is named after Byron Cole, who with his brother settled a donation land claim straddling the Oregon‚ÄìCalifornia border and established a stagecoach station called Cole's. After selling his interest in the station in 1859, Byron Cole acquired land and a mineral spring further north. In 1883, anticipating completion of a railroad between the two states, he built a hotel at the site. In August that year, a post office was established there and named White Point. Ed J. Farlow was the first postmaster and Cole the second. In 1892, the post office name was changed to Colestin, and it operated under that name until closing in 1943. The change in the post office name was preceded by construction of a Southern Pacific (SP) railway station at this location. In 1887, the SP had leased the Oregon and California Railroad line, which had extended as far south as Ashland by 1884. The SP then completed the line, connecting it to existing SP tracks in northern California. A railway timetable from that era lists Hornbrook as the next station south of Cole's on the SP's Mt.

He belonged to the avant-garde period of the sixties and was influenced by French Surrealism and American Beatnik. He actively participated in literary and artistic groups of the time such as The Roof of the Whale and La Rep√∫blica del Este, among the most known. His most famous poetry works are ¬øDuerme usted, se√±or presidente? (1962) and Eleg√≠a a la muerte de Guatimoc√≠n, mi padre, alias El Globo (1967). In 1973 he received the National Prize for Literature (Venezuela) for his collection of poems Copa de Huesos (1972).  Literary Groups   Sardio  Sardio (1954-1961) was created as a literary group opposed to Marcos P√©rez Jimenez's dictatorial government. The proposal of Sardio was both politic and aesthetic. After the dictatorship ended in 1958, they published a homonymous magazine (1958-1961) with eight issues. Later, they separated for political reasons. The group was made up by several poets, writers and painters, including Guillermo Sucre, Gonzalo Castellanos, Elisa Lerner, Salvador Garmendia, Caupolic√°n Ovalles, Adriano Gonz√°lez Le√≥n, Luis Garc√≠a Morales, R√≥mulo Aranguibel, Efra√≠n Hurtado, Antonio Pasquali, Francisco P√©rez Perdomo, Rodolfo Izaguirre, and Edmundo Aray. Caupolic√°n was a member of the Editorial Board of Sardio's last issue. The first manifesto of El Techo de la Ballena was published in the last page of that issue.  El Techo de la Ballena  El Techo de la Ballena (1961-1968) arises as a literary and artistic group conformed by some of the left-wing members of Sardio, including Caupolic√°n. The group published three issues of the magazine Rayado sobre el Techo. On March 24, 1961 El Techo de la Ballena opens its first exhibition entitled ‚ÄúPara restituir el magma‚Äù, at the same time the first manifesto was published in [http://icaadocs.mfah.org/icaadocs/ELAR El Techo de la Ballena has been described by the critics as an avant-garde group with revolutionary purposes and multidisciplinary media. It was very active between 1961 and 1965. Among its most explosive expressions is Homenaje a la Necrofilia‚Äù, by Carlos Contramaestre. Some of its most important members were Adriano Gonz√°lez Le√≥n, Alberto Brandt, Carlos Contramaestre, Caupolic√°n Ovalles, D√°maso Ogaz, Daniel Gonz√°lez, Edmundo Aray, Efra√≠n Hurtado, Francisco P√©rez Perdomo, Rodolfo Izaguirre and Salvador Garmendia, among others. Sol cuello cortado Sol cuello cortado (1964), a poetry magazine that appeared at the same time as El Techo de la Ballena, published six issues. It was founded by Caupolic√°n Ovalles and H√©ctor Silva Michelena; later, Ludovico Silva and Alfredo Silva Estrada contributed to the magazine. La Pandilla de Lautr√©amont La Pandilla de Lautr√©amont emerges after the disintegration of El Techo de la Ballena. Gathering around a literary magazine was not working, as was the case of Sardio, El Techo de la Ballena and Sol cuello cortado. After meeting the nada√≠stas in Colombia, Caupolic√°n realizes that it was necessary to create an open group, which was related to society and not revolving around an aesthetic expression but around conversation. Victor Valera Mora, Carlos Noguera, Luis Camilo Guevara, Mario Abreu, Jos√© Barroeta, and El√≠ Galindo joined the so- called Pandilla de Lautr√©amont. The group used to gather at a bar in Sabana Grande called El Vi√±edo. At one of those gatherings held in October 1968 Caupolic√°n appointed himself President of the newly founded Rep√∫blica del Este.  La Rep√∫blica del Este  Established as an open group, La Rep√∫blica del Este was located at the so-called Bermuda Triangle of Sabana Grande (Franco's, Camilo's and Il Vecchio Mulino bars and restaurants). It was intended to found a republic diametrically opposed to the one that officiated at the Palace of Miraflores, located in the West of Caracas. They edited five numbers of a homonymous magazine, in which Caupolic√°n Ovalles and Adriano Gonz√°lez Le√≥n participated as consultants. The Association of Venezuelan Writers publicly acknowledged La Rep√∫blica del Este in 1970. That same year, the population of La Rep√∫blica grew up, as a result of the Renewal of the School of Literature (Central University of Venezuela). But the highest increase in population occurred in 1974: people of all kinds having no relation with the political-literary origin of the group joined it. In 1973 the coup d‚Äô√©tat became a form of government at La Rep√∫blica del Este. Despite the profuse inflow of people arriving to the group, the permanent members were Adriano Gonz√°lez Le√≥n, Andr√©s Aguilar, Argimiro Brice√±o Le√≥n, Caupolic√°n Ovalles, Daniel Gonz√°lez, David Alizo, Denzil Romero, Enrique Hern√°ndez D‚ÄôJesus, El√≠ Galindo, El√≠as Vall√©s, H√©ctor Myerston, la Negra Maggi, Luis Camilo Guevara, Luis Correa, Luis Salazar, Luis Sutherland, Manuel Alfredo Rodr√≠guez, Manuel Matute, Mary Ferrero, Mateo Manaure, Orlando Araujo, Paco Benmam√°n, Pepe Luis Garrido, Rub√©n Osorio Canales, Salvador Garmendia, Miy√≥ Vestrini, V√≠ctor Valera Mora, among others. In 1973, La Rep√∫blica del Este's institutionality teeters and the coups d‚Äô√©tat became customary. Caupolic√°n himself says in an interview conducted by Mary Ferrero in this regard: ‚ÄúI legalized the coup d‚Äô√©tat as a valid weapon, I ended the administrative framework, established a new international order. The triumph of my candidacy meant anarchy and the victory of surreal thought‚Äù.  Works  *1962: ¬øDuerme usted, se√±or presidente? Ediciones del Techo de la Ballena. *1963: En uso de raz√≥n.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf, and a single white to cream-coloured flower with a white labellum with red bands. Description Caladenia curtisepala is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, sparsely hairy, dark green, linear leaf, long and wide. A single white to cream or pale pink flower, in diameter is borne on a spike high. The dorsal sepal is long, wide, linear to elliptic in shape and curves forward, partly forming a hood over the column. The back of the dorsal sepal is covered with many reddish-brown glands. The lateral sepals are long, wide, lance-shaped to egg-shaped and held horizontally, with their backs covered with glands similar to those on the dorsal sepal. The petals are lance-shaped to sickle-shaped but otherwise similar to the lateral sepals, although shorter and narrower. The labellum is more or less kidney-shaped, white with many narrow red bands and is long, wide when flattened and has three lobes. The lateral lobes are about wide and erect, sometimes slightly wavy on the side. The mid-lobe curves forward and has stalked teeth along its edge and two rows of stalked, yellow-tipped calli in its mid-line, the calli decreasing in size towards the tip of the labellum. The column is curved and is greenish with many irregular red bands and has broad wings. Flowering occurs in August or September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia curtisepala was first formally described by David L. Jones in 1991 and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The type specimen was collected at Mount Kuring- gai. The specific epithet (curtisepala) is derived from the Latin words curtus meaning \\"short\\" and sepalum meaning \\"sepal\\" referring to the dorsal which is smaller than in similar orchids. Distribution and habitat This caladenia grows in heath and low shrubland in the Central Coast of New South Wales where it grows in soil derived from Hawkesbury sandstone.

Pupils from the school progress onto Queen Anne High School. The building is a category C listed building. History McLean Primary School was first established in 1842 through a bequest by Reverend Allan McLean, a minister at Dunfermline Abbey. His bequest stated that the school was to ensure that education for working class children was to be provided at a low cost. In 1896, the school moved from Golfdrum Street to a new building in Baldridgeburn which was opened by Scottish-American entrepreneur, Andrew Carnegie. A ceremonial key from the school's opening is on show at Andrew Carnegie's Birthplace Museum, also in Dunfermline. During the first world war, McLean school was used as an army barracks for soldiers stationed in Dunfermline. Air raid shelters were provided in the second world war and the students had ARP (Air Raid Precaution) training regularly. In the 1930s, the head teacher Norman Johnson helped pioneer the use of film in schools. Extensions were made to the building between 1913 and 1915 and again in 1946. The original school building opened in 1896 is still in use today but was altered significantly in 1984 to modernise the interior. A new nursery was built in the northern part of the school grounds in 2000. Structure McLean Primary School has thirteen classes from Primary 1 through to Primary 7 as well as separate nursery classes both in the mornings and afternoons.

Owner of the Crystal River Ranch in Roaring Fork Valley, Colorado, she is a strong proponent of conservationism and preservation of the heritage of the American West, and helped implement the legal concept of conservation easements in the state. She is the chair and president of the Anschutz Family Foundation, which funds nonprofits, and also heads the Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Fund, which funds projects promoting women's self- sufficiency. She is an active member of many state and national boards. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2008 and the Colorado Business Hall of Fame in 2017. Early life and family Sue Anschutz grew up in Russell, Kansas, the daughter of Frederick and Marian Pfister Anschutz. Farming was part of her family's history, as her great-grandfather, Christian Anschutz, was one of the German farmers brought to Russia by Catherine the Great to increase the yield in the Volga River valley. Anschutz eventually left Russia for America and started a farm in Kansas. Frederick Anschutz began buying up ranches in the 1950s and tapping them for oil reserves, netting him his fortune. As a girl, Sue accompanied her father on his inspections of his oil fields, and learned to handle horses, brand cattle, and bale hay from the ranch hands. She has one younger brother, Philip, a billionaire philanthropist who heads the Anschutz Foundation. Career Like her father and brother, she is a graduate of the University of Kansas, attaining her bachelor's degree in education in 1955. She began working as a teacher, returning each summer to spend time with her family at their ranch. In 1987 she acquired ownership of the Crystal River Ranch in Roaring Fork Valley, which her father had purchased in 1966. Under her direction, the ranch's holdings grew from one bull and 33 cows to 1,700 head of cattle by 2008. In keeping with her drive for conservationism, she installed a self-propelled water system that does not use electricity or fossil fuels. Anschutz-Rodgers is a strong proponent of conservationism and the preservation of the heritage of the American West. She spearheaded the effort to implement conservation easements in Colorado, a legal concept that shields ranchland from future real estate development. Philanthropy When her father endowed the Anschutz Family Foundation in 1982, she became its executive director, president, and trustee. , she continues to serve as chair and president. From the initial endowment of $4.5 million, the foundation's assets increased to $55.5 million as of 2016, and it has awarded more than 9,000 grants worth $52.6 million in the area of human services. In the early 1990s Anschutz-Rodgers created Colorado Rural Philanthropy Days to encourage other philanthropists to fund nonprofits in the rural sector. She also heads the Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Fund, which funds projects promoting women's self-sufficiency. In 2003, she and her brother Philip donated $2 million toward a new exhibition gallery at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. In 2013 she endowed a $2 million chair in retinal diseases at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. In 2018, she made an additional gift to the Department of Ophthalmology and University of Colorado Hospital which led to the designation of the program as the UCHealth Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Eye Center. Other memberships Anschutz-Rodgers has been an active member of numerous boards at the state and national levels, including the Aspen Valley Land Trust, the Colorado Cattlemen's Agricultural Land Trust, the Colorado Conservation Trust, the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center, the Denver Police Foundation, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Jane Goodall Institute, the United States office of the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy of Kenya, and the National Fish and Wildlife Organization.

Born in New York City, she was the daughter of William J. and Julia Pierson Emmet; her surviving siblings were Robert Temple Emmet (1854‚Äì1936), her twin; William LeRoy Emmet (1858‚Äì1941); Devereux Emmet (1861‚Äì1934); Richard Stockton Emmet (b.1863); Lydia Field Emmet (1866‚Äì1952); Jane Emmet de Glehn (1873‚Äì1961); Christopher Temple Emmet (1868‚Äì1957); and Thomas Addis Emmet (b.1870). Her first cousin was the painter Ellen Emmet Rand. Sherwood may have received her earliest training in art from her mother; a sketchbook dating to 1873 was in the hands of family members in 1987. Rosina traveled to Europe in 1876‚Äì1877, and was presented to Queen Victoria during the trip. Returning to New York, she and her friend Dora Wheeler began study with William Merritt Chase, and by 1881 she took studio space in the Tenth Street Studio Building. Among her earliest works were illustrations for publications such as Harper's Magazine, and in 1880 she won the $1,000 first prize in a competition to design a Christmas card for Louis Prang & Company. Sherwood and Wheeler worked together in the design firm Associated Artists, run by Candace Wheeler, Dora's mother; they designed tapestries, curtains, and wallpaper. Subjects included a variety drawn from American literature. In 1884‚Äì1885 the women attended classes at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris; Sherwood's instructor there was Tony Robert-Fleury. Rosina married, in 1887, Arthur Sherwood, having five children with him, including future Pulitzer Prize winner Robert E. Sherwood. She continued working after her marriage, often looking to members of her family as her subjects. \\"Disgusted with life, she retired to the society of books\\" an illustration for a story by Elizabeth Eggleston Seelye Elizabeth Eggleston Seelye's story \\"‚ÄúThe A.O.I.B.R.\\" appeared in Harper's Bazaar in 1889 with Sherwood's illustration of a child reading. The Rockwell Centre for American Visual Studies cites this as a surprisingly early illustration of a girl reading. The subject of a female reading in this sketch is thought as rare (like the examples in Louisa Allcott's Little Women). A portrait of Archer Huntington, husband of Anna Hyatt Huntington, dated to 1892, is currently owned by the Hispanic Society of America. In 1893, Sherwood painted the mural The Republic's Welcome to Her Daughters for the Woman's Building of the 1893 World's Fair. Her work was also exhibited in the Palace of Fine Arts at the Fair She accepted commissions once more in 1918 to provide support for her family, and continued painting watercolors for much of her career. One of these, 1922's San Pedro, Manila, was included in the inaugural exhibition of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, American Women Artists 1830‚Äì1930, in 1987.

The only child, of late in life parents, he remained a solitary individual for the majority of his life, never marrying himself. Although a lifelong bachelor, he lived much of his adult life with his housekeeper, Lizzie, of whom, from his diary entries, he was obviously very fond. Lizzie remained in his service until her death in 1968. At an early age he started keeping his diaries and found his vocation in buying and selling rare, second hand books. It was through his experience, in finding that publications had a much greater re-sale value with the author's signature, that a lifelong obsession with autographs began. His essays were a regular feature of every edition of The Saturday Book between 1945 and 1972, presenting his work on the same platform as major literary and artistic figures of postwar Britain. Through his literary interest he met numerous famous individuals, and had one of his published diaries introduced by No√´l Coward. He kept his diaries right up until his death on 3 July 1973 aged 64.

His daughter Arabella has been cited as the first of the fleet to set foot on South Australian shores, and his wife Lucy as the first white woman to die in South Australia. History Thomas H Beare of Netley, Hampshire, his wife Lucy, and their four children arrived at Kangaroo Island, South Australia aboard , one of the \\"First Fleet of South Australia\\", on 27 or 28 July 1836. Lucy, who had given birth on board the ship to a daughter who died shortly after, died within six weeks of giving birth again, this time to a healthy daughter. Charlotte Hudson Beare (c. 1782 ‚Äì 16 December 1875), a sister of Thomas, was also a passenger. She married Samuel Stephens (1808 ‚Äì 18 January 1840), the Colonial Manager, on 24 September 1836. This marriage, the second in the Colony and the source of much gossip on account of their age difference, was performed by Captain George Martin aboard the anchored at Nepean Bay. Shortly after arrival, Beare, William Giles and Henry Mildred imported a batch of Merino ewes from Van Diemens Land to Kangaroo Island, some of the first brought into the colony, though stock losses on the unusually long trip aboard the were considerable. In 1838 he purchased section 101, Hundred of Adelaide, and named it Netley, by which name the modern suburb is known. He supported his brother-in-law John Wrathall Bull in his claim against John Ridley as the true inventor of the stripper, having built the prototype.

It closed in 1980 but was not demolished until 2009. History The Chin Tiki saw construction begin in 1965, but did not open until 1967. A former engineer for Ford, Chin designed the restaurant himself, and had a hand in most of the construction. Inspired by the burgeoning Tiki culture fad of the 1950s and 1960s, the first floor restaurant was ornately decorated \\"with towering tiki statues, waterfalls and a bamboo bridge.\\" It also featured a large black light aquarium mural. The drink menu included well known tiki drinks such as the Sharks Tooth, Head Hunter, and Fog Cutter, as well as the Chin Tiki Punch and the Chin Tiki Special, which was a communal drink meant for sharing, served in a large clam shell with long straws, and described as \\"a fusing of fine rums, brandy, liqueurs and fresh fruit juices crowned with a gardenia\\". The second floor housed a spacious nightclub with an even larger waterfall, imitation rock walls and a rattan covered stage. The Chin Tiki hosted live music and an authentic Polynesian floor show with Hawaiian dancers and fire-breathers. The restaurant was said to be frequented by such celebrities as Muhammad Ali, Barbra Streisand and Joe DiMaggio. One of Chin's early competitors was the other large Detroit area Tiki restaurant named the Mauna Loa, but it was short lived. Following Detroit's economic downturn, Chin shuttered Chin Tiki in 1980, where it remained untouched for two decades and was deemed \\"a Tiki tomb, a time capsule,\\" by local tiki enthusiasts. However, after Chin died in 2006 his family quickly sold the building to Olympia Development LLC, owned by Detroit mogul Mike Ilitch and family. The building was torn down in 2009.  Port O' Three  Marvin Chin also owned the Port O' Three Tiki restaurant in nearby Bloomfield Hills, MI. Its menu and signage used many of the same graphics as the Chin Tiki and used the same cocktail menu. The name came from his \\"three types of food\\" concept for the restaurant which he advertised for on his matchbooks: \\"Marvin Chin proudly presents a new concept in dining. A unique combination of sea food, Polynesian, and Japanese cuisine under one roof....\\", but the restaurant stayed in business for only a short period of time. Chin's is a small Cantonese restaurant in Livonia, MI that is decorated with some of the Chin Tiki's former statues.  In popular culture  The Chin Tiki was later famous for being a film location for the movie 8 Mile. The unique look of the building had gotten the attention of production designer Phil Messina, who had Universal Studios contact Chin to contract the use of his facility for the filming. The renewed interest had fueled speculation for a short period of time that the restaurant would reopen.

Such strategies are integral for retailers because they directly affect how their customers interact with their merchandise, and therefore, their brand. The decisions that these strategies help make are what to sell, where to sell it, when to sell it, whom to sell it to, and how much to sell.  Deep assortment  A company that utilizes a deep assortment to compete in a market does so by carrying a vast array of colors, sizes and other options of a particular category. An example of this could be an athletic shoe store. They will carry a large assortment of athletic shoes in a wide range of sizes and colors, sometimes to the point of exhausting all possible options, but they will not carry a women‚Äôs sandal.  Wide assortment  Conversely, a wide assortment strategy is one that aims to have at least one of every product category. The product categories themselves are not meant to be very specialized. An example of this could be found at a neighborhood hardware store. They will likely have a toilet seat available for sale there, but it would not be anywhere the number available through a plumbing store or a Home Depot. The goal here is to provide a little of everything rather than a lot of one thing.  Scrambled assortment  A scrambled assortment strategy is used to attract customers outside of a company‚Äôs main target audience by offering products outside of its core offering. An example of this might be an ice cream shop that chooses to also offer frozen yogurt or Italian ice in order to attract people who are not looking for ice cream. By doing so, they are able to provide service to more people than they otherwise would by pulling in members from other markets as well.  Localized assortment  A localized assortment strategy is one that optimizes inventory based on a particular store‚Äôs location. A location of a store in Nashville for example would carry different products than a store in Seattle. Clothing stores do this often for seasonality reasons, as well as hardware stores ‚Äì selling boots and shovels in cold climates and sandals and sprinklers in more temperate areas. This can often be difficult to successfully implement because of all the numerous nuances in anticipating changes in cultures, climates, and local events. When it is done successfully, however, customers feel like they are getting a more specialized assortment offering because it has essentially been personalized for their anticipated needs. Companies that utilize these types of assortments also typically will use predictive analytics to assist in their decisions.  Mass market assortment  Stores that want to offer an assortment that appeals to the mass market, in that there is a large assortment of products available in a wide variety of options, aims to cover all bases so that anyone looking for something could come in find what they need. Examples of stores that utilize a mass market assortment would be Walmart, Target, Amazon, or Home Depot. The goal here is to offer as much as possible to as many people as possible. Assortment optimization Assortment planning is the process to determine what and how much should be carried in a merchandise category. Assortment plan is a trade-off between the breadth and depth of products that a retailer wishes to carry. Assortment optimization refers to the problem of selecting a set of products to offer to a group of customers to maximize the revenue that is realized when customers make purchases according to their preferences. Assortment affects costs because it drives inventory decisions. Poorly conceived inefficient assortments raise inventory costs and waste valuable shelf space. Assortment optimization is essential to a wide variety of application domains that includes retail, online advertising, and social security. The process brings order out of the mind-numbing complexity of thousands of SKUs across scores of markets and retailers. This process demands internal alignment within manufacturers and retailers before they enter into a collaborative process with one another. Like inventory optimization, assortment optimization too takes demand and supply volatility into account.

Voters chose twelve representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. This was the last election in which Alabama had twelve electoral votes: the Great Migration caused the state to lose congressional districts after the 1930 Census produced the first Congressional redistricting since 1911. Alabama voted narrowly for the Democratic nominee, Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York, over the Republican nominee, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover of California. Smith's running mate was Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson of Arkansas, while Hoover's running mate was Senate Majority Leader Charles Curtis of Kansas. The only other candidate on the ballot was Socialist Norman Thomas, who received a mere four hundred and sixty votes.Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections; 1928 Presidential General Election Results ‚Äì Alabama Background Since the 1890s, Alabama had become a one- party state ruled by the Democratic Party. Disenfranchisement of almost all African-Americans and a large proportion of poor whites via poll taxes, literacy testsPerman, Michael; Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888‚Äì1908, Chapel Hill: North Carolina Press, 2001, Introduction and informal harassment had essentially eliminated opposition parties outside of presidential campaigns in a few northern hill counties. The only competitive statewide elections became Democratic Party primaries, and ever since 1900 the Democratic Party won over two-thirds of the limited number of votes cast even in presidential elections. Between 1900 and 1924, the southern bloc had been able to veto presidential nominations by extralimital branches of the Democratic Party. This changed before the 1928 election, as most Democrats decided to sit out the convention due to their belief the party had no chance of winning the November election.Paulson, Arthur C.; Electoral Realignment and the Outlook for American Democracy; p. 61 Consequently, Al Smith, a four-term Governor of New York, was able to win the nomination on the first ballot. A bitter fight Four characteristics of Smith made him anything but an ideal candidate for Southern Democrats: he was a devout Catholic, opposed to Prohibition, linked with New York City's Tammany Hall political machine, and the son of Irish and Italian immigrants. Whilst it is generally thought that the South would have accepted a man possessing one of those characteristics,Kennedy; David M. and Cohen, Lizabeth; The American Pageant, Volume 2, p. 739 the combination proved a bitter dose for many of Alabama's loyal Democrats. It was also thought by some, including those close to the revived Ku Klux Klan, that Smith was too friendly with blacksRappleye; Charles; Herbert Hoover in the White House: The Ordeal of the Presidency, p. 39 and some Alabama whites unsubtly called Smith \\"nigger, nigger, nigger\\".Feldman, Glenn; Before Brown: Civil Rights and White Backlash in the Modern South; p. 270 Nonetheless, these people did not think Hoover any safer on the race issue, although they did prefer Hoover's view on Prohibition.Feldman, Glenn; Politics, Society, and the Klan in Alabama, 1915-1949; p. 190 The conflict between disapproval of Smith's faith and policies on one hand and extreme traditional hostility towards the Republican Party in almost all of Alabama (the only exceptions being the historically anti-secession counties of Winston and a few populist strongholds like Chilton) produced an exceptionally bitter campaign.Feldman; Politics, Society and the Klan in Alabama; p. 168 Black Belt whites ‚Äì who had controlled the state government since disenfranchisement of blacks and poor whites ‚Äì also felt Smith's social views obnoxious, especially his opposition to the Ku Klux Klan. Consequently, many of Alabama's voters swore to vote for Hoover without declaring themselves Republicans, instead calling themselves \\"Hoovercrats\\" (a portmanteau of \\"Hoover\\" and \\"Democrat\\"). Defections were particularly pronounced in North Alabama, where a contiguous block of counties from Birmingham northeastwards to the Tennessee border uniformly gave majorities for Hoover. Hoover also won a number of counties in the far southern coastal regions, whose soils had always proved unsuitable for cotton plantations.Key, V.O. junior; Southern Politics in State and Nation; p. 328 On the other hand, the whites of the black belt, who were like Al Smith \\"wet\\" (opposed to prohibition of alcohol), did not bolt from the Democratic Party because of this alcohol issue and their strong view that the Democrats were the best safeguard for white supremacy.Key; Southern Politics in State and Nation; p. 234, 319 Overall, Smith held the state by just over seven thousand votes, although opponents of Smith believed that electoral fraud was widespread in the black belt. State judges Hugh Locke, Horace Wilkinson and Ira Champion argued that up to seventeen thousand ballots for Hoover had been rejected.Helm, William P. (junior); 'Smith Foes Want Alabama Recount: Assert Southern \\"Stronghold\\" Went for Hoover; To Ask Congressional Action ‚Äì Fraud Evidence Claimed'; The Washington Post, December 12, 1928, p. 2 No recount, however, was ever contemplated by authorities. This result constitutes the second-closest presidential election in Alabama since Reconstruction behind that of 1980, another Republican landslide this time affected by the personal vote in the South for Jimmy Carter. A strong correlation was revealed between percentage of blacks in the population and (white) voter loyalty to the Democratic Party: of the twenty-six counties won by Hoover, only five had population over thirty percent Negro, and most of these were urban area less attached to the traditions of black belt politics, whilst Chambers County was the home of Hoovercrat senator J. Thomas Heflin.Key; Southern Politics in State and Nation; p. 324 At the other extreme, of the ten counties possessing populations under ten percent Negro in 1930,Bunche, Ralph J.; The Political Status of the Negro in the Age of FDR, p. 65 only Marion County stayed loyal to Smith.

Life and career  Born in Brazil, Fernandes studied at New York University under Haig P. Manoogian and began work as a crewman on low-budget pornographic films. Throughout the 1970s, Fernandes shot many entries in the emerging \\"porno chic\\" subgenre, including the seminal Deep Throat and director Gerard Damiano's follow-up feature, The Devil in Miss Jones, a film which Roger Ebert described as being the \\"best entry\\" in the entire genre. In 1978, Fernandes made his first foray into mainstream filmmaking with Land of No Return, a wilderness adventure film directed by Kent Bateman and starring William Shatner. Fernandes subsequently shot Bloodrage, a low-budget exploitation film which reused numerous locations, cast, and crew from the adult films wildly popular at the time. Fernandes subsequently became the go-to director of photographer for the film's director, Joseph Zito, shooting his follow-up picture The Prowler. The cult slasher film caught the attention of Frank Mancuso Jr., the producer of the Friday the 13th film franchise. Mancuso hired Zito direct the series' fourth entry, and Fernandes re-teamed with the director to shoot the film. Fernandes then shot numerous Chuck Norris action films produced by Cannon Films, including Missing in Action and Invasion U.S.A.

She was the hired armed cutter Nile. After a brief, undistinguished career, the Navy sold her in 1810 only to have to break her up in 1811. Career Between 15 November 1806 and 13 January 1807 Nile was at Portsmouth undergoing repairs. Lieutenant James Lloyd had commissioned her in November 1806.Winfield (2008), pp.370-1. On 12 February was wrecked off the √éle de R√©, near Rochefort. She had been cruising to watch enemy vessels in Rochefort when she hit the Grande Blanche rock. Despite attempts to lighten her that included cutting away her masts, she continued to founder. At daybreak three British vessels approached and took off the crew, enduring fire from shore batteries as they did so. The first was Nile, followed later by the frigates and .Hepper (1994), p.117. Lloyd proved a disappointment. Within 1807, Lieutenant Thomas Johnson, who had commanded the hired armed cutter Nile, replaced Lloyd. Unfortunately, Johnson was imprisoned for smuggling.United States Naval Institute Proceedings, Vol. 69, p.795. Lieutenant Symons replaced Johnson for the Channel, but on 4 December Symons sailed for the Mediterranean. On 25 December 1807 she captured Industry.

On October 27, 2005, Wilkins shot and killed Willie Freeman and Mike Silva. Freeman had allegedly cheated Wilkins in a drug deal; Silva was with Freeman at the time and thus witnessed the killing. The numbers \\"666\\" and a pentagram matching one of Wilkins' numerous tattoos were found carved into Silva's car at the scene of the murders. Wilkins' fingerprints were also found. The previous day, Wilkins also allegedly killed Gilbert Vallejo outside a bar in south Fort Worth after a dispute over a payphone. On October 28, Wilkins was arrested and charged with the murders of Freeman and Silva; he later also confessed to murdering Vallejo. He was sentenced to death on March 12, 2008, after only 90 minutes of deliberation by the jury. When asked by his defense lawyer if he wanted to die, Wilkins said: \\"I guess, subconsciously, I've been trying to get myself killed since I was 12 or 13 years old. I don't have nothing to live for. I haven't been any good to anybody for the last 20 years and I won't be for the next 20 or the 20 after that.\\" Wilkins was initially scheduled to be executed on October 28, 2015 (which, coincidentally, was the 10th anniversary of his arrest). His execution was stayed and later rescheduled to January 11, 2017. Wilkins was executed by lethal injection on January 11, 2017, at 6:29 PM. He was 48 years old.

He was also a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center. He is the co-author of Dirty Little Secrets: The Persistence of Corruption in American Politics written with political scientist Larry Sabato and published in 1996. A New York Times book review called the book's approach \\"fiercely bipartisan\\". Early life Simpson was born to a Jewish family and graduated from Conestoga High School in 1982, then went to George Washington University, where his neck was broken in a car crash. Career Before Simpson worked for The Wall Street Journal, he was a reporter for Roll Call, where he broke stories on GOPAC, a political action committee headed by House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Simpson left journalism in part to earn more money. Explaining why he left journalism, he quipped: ‚ÄúWe don't use the word 'sold out.' We use the word 'cashed in.'‚Äù  Trump opposition research  From September 2015 to May 2016, Simpson was retained by a conservative newspaper, the Washington Free Beacon, to collect information on many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump. In April of 2016, the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign's law firm, Perkins Coie, retained Simpson's company Fusion GPS. From April 2016 into early May, the Washington Free Beacon and the Clinton Campaign/DNC were independently both clients of Fusion GPS. In June 2016, Fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent, to obtain information on Trump. Steele used his \\"old contacts and farmed out other research to native Russian speakers who made phone calls on his behalf\\". After November 2016, funding from the Democratic Party ceased, and Simpson reportedly spent his own money to fund further work on the dossier.  Congressional testimony  In 2017 during Congressional inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, Simpson testified before the House Intelligence Committee that Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, and Ted Malloch, a \\"significant figure\\" in the Brexit campaign, had ties to each other. On August 22, 2017, Simpson was questioned for 10 hours by the Senate Judiciary Committee in a closed-door meeting. The Committee did not release a transcript of the hearing.

Lewis (born 1861) was the first African-American woman journalist in Boston. She started her career in the 1880s with the Boston Advocate, a black community newspaper, and in the 1890s began writing for the Boston Herald. To disguise her gender, she used the pen name \\"Bert Islew\\".  Early life and education  Lillian Alberta Lewis was born in 1861 in Boston. Her childhood home was a stop on the Underground Railroad, and it is thought that one of her parents was an escaped slave. She attended the Bowdoin Grammar School, Girls' High School, and Boston Normal School. Lewis was a gifted student with a literary bent. While still in high school, she took to writing and delivering lectures on subjects such as temperance, usually with a thread of humor running through them. One lecture that was especially popular was \\"The Mantle of the Church Covereth a Multitude of Humbugs,\\" which poked fun at pious hypocrisy.  Career  Lewis began writing for the Boston Advocate in 1889, using the pen name \\"Bert Islew\\" to disguise her gender. (\\"Islew\\" is an anagram of \\"Lewis\\".) That same year, she made headlines when she was admitted to the New England Woman's Press Association. Sales had been flagging when Lewis joined the Advocate, and her popular society column, They Say, is credited with saving the paper. She also contributed to the Richmond Planet and a monthly magazine called Our Women and Children, as well as writing short stories and contributing to various journals. She was one of the few African- American columnists active during the 19th century. Monroe Alpheus Majors wrote of Lewis's work in 1893, \\"Her pen, as the sword, is ever drawn in defense of her race, and those who have had the honor of crossing weapons with her generally retire from the combat feeling that they have been vigorously fought.\\" In the 1890s she began working for the Boston Herald as a stenographer and reporter. (A Boston Post announcement in 1892 refers to her as the Herald's \\"society editress\\".) She was one of the first African-American women to write for a white-run newspaper. In 1894, Lewis was living on Myrtle Street in Beacon Hill and was considered one of the two \\"most brilliant and progressive young colored women in Boston.\\" She was a stylish dresser, and moved with ease between Boston's elite South End and West End social sets. She continued writing for the Boston Herald until 1901. On August 7, 1901 she married Ernest F. Feurtado, a Jamaican. In 1920 she became the first African- American woman clerk in the Collector's Office at Boston City Hall. She retired in 1934. In 1925 she published a book titled Peter Salem: Colored American Soldier of the American Revolution.

Within the state of Nebraska, the highway is known as the Gold Rush Byway, one of nine scenic byways across the state. The highway follows along the old Sidney-Black Hills trail which played a crucial role during the Black Hills Gold Rush in the late 1870s. It served as the primary route to transport gold and mining gear between Sidney, Nebraska and the Black Hills to the north. Today, the highway enters Nebraska in the southeastern portion of the Nebraska Panhandle on the state line with Colorado northeast of Julesburg and continues in a northerly direction to the South Dakota state line north of Chadron. US 385 was an original entry in the initial development of the US Highway System in 1926. It originally ran from Comfort, Texas to Raton, New Mexico and did not come near Nebraska. In 1935, most of the routing of US 385 was resigned as US 87. The current incarnation of US 385 was commissioned in 1959 bringing the highway into Nebraska along the new alignment that stretched from Big Bend all the way to Deadwood, South Dakota in the Black Hills. Route description The Nebraska Sandhills Colorado to Bridgeport US 385 enters Nebraska on the Colorado state line northwest of Julesburg, Colorado. Traveling to the northwest through agricultural fields and alongside Lodgepole Creek, the highway passes beneath I-80 just before it enters the small city of Chappell. The highway has a connection to I-80 south of town via Link 25A. Here, the highway meets up with US 30, the Lincoln Highway, running concurrently with it for about 25 miles to the northwest passing through Lodgepole before turning west and passing through the small communities of Sunol and Colton. At the highway approaches Sidney, US 385 breaks off from US 30 and turns north along the east side of Sidney. After departing Sidney, US 385 travels north as it begins its trek into the vast agricultural fields of the rural Nebraska Panhandle. A couple miles north of Sidney, the highway comes alongside the BNSF Railway which it runs parallel with for the next eighty miles with a few deviations. Continuing north through the small towns of Gurley and Dalton the landscape takes on a bit of change as the highway approaches somewhat rugged terrain as it descends into the North Platte River Valley. As US 385 approaches the North Platte River it joins up with N-92, the state's longest highway. Here, it takes a westerly turn towards Bridgeport, a town which takes its name from the Camp Clarke Bridge constructed in 1876 three miles to the west. As the highway approaches Bridgeport from the south it joins up with US 26 to cross the North Platte River. On the south side of town, US 26 continues to the west where it passes Chimney Rock National Historic Site just twelve miles down the road. Continuing north across the river the two highways diverge, with US 26 heading east towards Broadwater and Ogallala while US 385 resumes its northward heading. For a brief few miles the roadway is, again, surrounded by agricultural fields, brought to life with center pivot irrigation north of Bridgeport. The highway transitions into slightly rugged terrain as it climbs back up, 400 feet, out of the valley. The Pine Ridge Escarpment with Ponderosa Pines Bridgeport to South Dakota The highway comes to a junction with Link 62A north of Bridgeport. Here, the Heartland Expressway joins US 385 from the west, a high priority corridor between Denver and Rapid City, South Dakota. Just a couple miles after this junction, the highway quickly passes through the unincorporated community of Angora. As the highway continues northeast from here, it enters the western reaches of the Nebraska Sandhills for about fifteen miles before it arrives in Alliance to meet up with N-2 just west of a large BNSF railyard. Alliance is home to Carhenge, a replica of England's Stonehenge constructed with vintage American automobiles. The concurrent highways leave Alliance to the northwest and after a few miles diverge. US 385 turns to the north, while N-2 continues to the northwest, taking the BNSF railway with it. As US 385 continues north it passes through additional spotty portions of the sandhills as it travels over forty miles without encountering any towns. South of Chadron the highway passes through Chadron State Park in the Pine Ridge Ranger District of the Nebraska National Forest. This area is part of an escarpment that lies between the Niobrara and White Rivers. Forested buttes, ridges and canyons have been carved into the high tableland. Sharing similarities with the Black Hills, the area is forested with Ponderosa Pine and contains a variation of wildlife such as bighorn sheep, elk, and mule deer, which are not common elsewhere in the state. The highway then enters Chadron where it joins US 20 along the west side of the city. It runs concurrently with US 20 to the west for two miles before departing to the north. US 385 then passes the Chadron Municipal Airport before turning to the northwest where it reaches the South Dakota state line. From there it continues north into the Black Hills towards Deadwood, South Dakota. History Black Hills gold rush US 385 travels south to north through the Nebraska Panhandle which has been part of the state since it was acquired in 1803 as part of the vast Louisiana Purchase. Much of inland Nebraska, including the Panhandle became important regions for overland travel via horse and wagon. This included the California, Mormon, and Oregon trails as well as the Pony Express route which passed through the region. Settlers to Nebraska were mostly farmers, but the discovery of gold in Wyoming in 1859 sent a rush of speculators westward across the state. In 1874, during the Black Hills Expedition led by Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer, the discovery of gold in the region sparked the Black Hills Gold Rush. As prospectors located valuable sources of gold along Deadwood and Whitewood Creeks, thousands more prospectors entered the area looking to stake their claim. In April, 1876, a gold outcropping was discovered near Lead, South Dakota. This gold claim became the Homestake Mine and was the primary source of the placer gold being mined from the surrounding area. Over the next century, ten percent of the world's gold supply would come from this site. Sidney, Nebraska became an important city during the gold rush. It was an optimal starting point for gold prospectors. It was adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad and on established trails from the east, as well as to the north via the Sidney-Black Hills Trail. The trail was also preferred as it was shorter and through less treacherous terrain than trails to the west. The construction of Camp Clarke Bridge over the North Platte River in 1876, three miles west of modern-day Bridgeport also boosted its appeal. This allowed prospectors and freight to arrive via rail and continue north into the Black Hills with relative ease. The bridge contained sixty-one wooden trusses and spanned nearly . Tolls ranged between $2 and $6 per wagon and up to $10 for heavy freight wagons. Concord type stagecoach typically used on the trail While prospectors flooded the area, along with them came those who would service the nascent mining industry. This included stagecoach lines that traveled between Sidney and the Black Hills carrying freight and passengers. Sometimes stagecoaches would depart Sidney for Deadwood three times each day. Conditions on the stagecoaches were usually cramped as upwards of sixteen people could be carried at a time. Between 1874 and 1880 most of the supplies and freight coming to and from the gold camps traveled this trail. Thousands of stagecoaches and wagons are estimated to have traveled the route during this time. At the peak of the gold rush in 1878 and 1879, fifty to seventy- five freight wagons left Sidney every day and an estimated 22-million pounds of freight traveled along the trail. Each week, gold was shipped out of the Black Hills to Sidney, sometimes with daily loads approaching $200,000 in value (equivalent to $ in ). It was during this time that stagecoach robberies became frequent occurrences. This became such a problem that the Gilmer and Salisbury stage lines manager, Luke Voorhees, attempted to capture the bandits to prevent loss of business along the route. When that wasn't enough, in 1878, he enlisted the help of Concord stagecoach builders, Abbot-Downing Company, to manufacture an armored stagecoach to withstand attacks. These armored stagecoaches were lined with half inch steel, portholes for windows and outfitted with an 800-pound steel safe accompanied by six to eight armed guards. Throughout three years of service, the armored stagecoach, nicknamed \\"Old Ironsides\\" was only robbed once. In 1880, a railroad between Chicago and Pierre, South Dakota severely damaged the freight business in Sidney. As the faster northerly route became preferred, freight companies moved their business to Pierre, mostly returning Sidney to the quieter times before the Gold Rush. Predecessor highways Most of the US 385 corridor was defined by the trails created during the Gold Rush, especially north of Sidney. Prior to the designation of US 385 in 1958 the route was covered by a combination of existing state highways. N-27 ran from the Colorado state line to Chappell where it met up with US 30\\\\. From there, US 30 carried the route west to Sidney then departed the city to the north along N-19. N-19 then continued along the rest of the modern day route north to the South Dakota state line passing through Bridgeport, Alliance, and Chadron. Future Heartland Expressway US 385 north of Link 62A east of Scottsbluff is part of the federally designated high priority corridor titled the Heartland Expressway that connects Rapid City, South Dakota with Denver, Colorado via improved four-lane divided highways. The Heartland Expressway is a portion of a high priority international corridor between Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada called the Ports to Plains Corridor. This international corridor is made up of three high priority systems, of which the Heartland Expressway is one. The other two systems include the Theodore Roosevelt Expressway between Rapid City and Saskatoon and The Ports to Plains Corridor between Monterrey and Denver. Together, the systems complete an international trade corridor between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Portions of the Heartland Expressway in Colorado and South Dakota are already complete, however progress has been slow in Nebraska. Prior to 2016, no portion of US 385 had been upgraded to four lanes in Nebraska, however portions of the expressway along US 26 between Morrill and Minatare as well as N-71 south of Scottsbluff to I-80 are upgraded to four-lane divided highway. =Nebraska Link 62A to Alliance= In 2015, the environmental assessment for the section of US 385 between Link 62A and Alliance was approved by the Federal Highway Administration. This segment would be constructed in three portions, the first of which got underway in 2016 and involved the stretch of US 385 between Alliance to south of town at an estimated cost of $23,655,000. The second segment would cover the section of US 375 between Link 62A and the first segment south of Alliance. This portion of the project is slated for construction in 2018 at a cost of $31,182,000. The third portion of this segment would involve construction of a sweeping curve between Link 62A and the newly upgraded US 385\\\\. =Alliance to Chadron= Original plans for the Heartland Expressway called for divided four-lane highways throughout, however the high cost of construction through of mostly rural area made the project cost prohibitive to be built at that standard. In September, 2016 Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts announced $300 million in transportation projects to be funded via the Build Nebraska Act and the Transportation Innovation Act. Of the projects included, the US 385 corridor between Alliance and Chadron was slated for design work. Rather than planning to construct this corridor as a four-lane divided highway, it will instead be planned as a Super 2 design at a projected cost of $89 million.

Originally introduced to wrestling while serving as a military police officer in the Marines, Evans trained and began her career on the independent circuit. She started working for WWE in their NXT developmental territory in 2016, and participated in their inaugural Mae Young Classic. After feuding with Kairi Sane in NXT, Evans debuted on Raw in December 2018, entering a feud with Becky Lynch that culminated in a mixed tag team match in the main event of Extreme Rules.  Early life  Estrella- Kadlec was born Macey Evans in Georgia on March 24, 1990. According to ESPN, she was \\"raised in a home torn by depression and drug and alcohol abuse\\" and had to live in tents at times while growing up due to her parents' legal problems. Her father, who had entertained thoughts of becoming a wrestler but never acted on them, died of a drug overdose before she got her WWE tryout.  Military career  Estrella-Kadlec is a veteran of the Marines, serving as a military police officer with the Special Reaction Team. She enlisted at age 19 and served for five years, earning a bachelor's degree and starting a construction business while on active duty. She was introduced to professional wrestling while in the Marines through a Staff Sergeant who promoted independent shows on the side. On the second show of which she attended, the Staff Sergeant booked her to wrestle him.  Professional wrestling career   Independent circuit (2014‚Äì2015)  Estrella-Kadlec trained under Tom Caiazzo at the American Premier Wrestling training facility in Statesboro, Georgia. She made her debut for the promotion in 2014, later winning the company's World Heavyweight Championship.  WWE  = NXT (2016‚Äì2019) = Evans (left) and Bianca Belair before a tag team match at a house show in June 2018 On April 12, 2016, Estrella-Kadlec signed a WWE contract. She made her wrestling debut at a house show, on October 20, in a battle royal, which was ultimately won by Ember Moon. Three months later, in her first appearance on NXT, Evans teamed with Sarah Bridges in a tag team match which they lost to the team of Billie Kay and Peyton Royce. In 2017, Estrella was given the ring name Lacey Evans, which is her sister's maiden name. She was used mostly as a jobber to various competitors. In July, Evans participated in the inaugural Mae Young Classic, defeating Taynara Conti in the first round, but losing to Toni Storm in the second round. On the January 17, 2018 episode of NXT, Evans established herself as a heel as she complained to NXT General Manager William Regal for allowing \\"the lowest forms of societal trash\\" like Nikki Cross, Ember Moon, and Kairi Sane to compete in the women's division. In April, Evans was placed in her first feud with Sane, as the two exchanged victories and attacked each other throughout the next few weeks. Eventually, Evans lost to Sane on the June 6 episode of NXT to end their feud. Throughout the rest of the year, Evans started a winning streak, defeating the likes of Dakota Kai and Candice LeRae. In December, she competed in a fatal four-way match to determine the number one contender for the NXT Women's Championship, however, the match was won by Bianca Belair. = Main roster (2019‚Äìpresent) = On the December 17, 2018 episode of Raw, Evans was advertised as one of six NXT wrestlers about to move to the main roster. She lost to Natalya in a dark match on the January 7, 2019 tapings of Main Event, and made her official main roster debut at the Royal Rumble on January 27. She entered the women's Royal Rumble match at number 1 and lasted over 29 minutes, eliminating The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce), before she was eliminated by Charlotte Flair. After that, Evans repeatedly appeared on Raw, SmackDown, and pay-per-views to interrupt various segments and matches by walking out on stage, waving to the crowd, and leaving. Shortly after WrestleMania 35, Evans was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up, and placed in her first feud on the main roster as she continuously attacked Raw and SmackDown Women's Champion Becky Lynch. This led to a title match between the two for the Raw Women's Championship on May 19, at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, where Evans lost to Lynch via submission. A few minutes later, Evans helped Charlotte Flair win the SmackDown Women's Championship from Lynch as she hit her with her finisher, the Women's Right, and allowed her to take advantage of the attack. Throughout mid-2019, Evans continued to feud with Lynch and chase her for the Raw Women's Championship. At Stomping Grounds she lost again to Lynch, and in the main event, was Baron Corbin's choice for a special referee for the Universal Championship match, due to Rollins dating Lynch. Evans and Corbin challenged Lynch and Rollins for their respective titles in a Last Chance Winner Takes All Mixed tag team match at Extreme Rules, where they failed to win the match after Rollins pinned Corbin, thus ending her feud with Becky Lynch. On October 11, Evans was drafted to SmackDown as part of the 2019 WWE Draft. At the Crown Jewel event, Evans and Natalya became the first female wrestlers to wrestle in Saudi Arabia, where Evans lost. The two women embraced afterwards, breaking kayfabe to absorb their historical moment. Evans then went on to compete in the first ever 15 woman elimination tag match representing Team Smackdown at the pay-per-view event ‚ÄúSurvivor Series‚Äù where the first time ever the NXT women‚Äôs locker room would also compete in the match. Evans was able to get the elimination over 11-time women‚Äôs champion and The Captain of Team Raw Charlotte Flair via pin, after her teammate Asuka betrayed her own team and shot poison mist into Flair‚Äôs eyes, allowing Evans to take advantage of the situation and allowing her to hit her with her finisher . Shortly after, she was eliminated by Natalya via roll up, who was representing Team Raw, however, Team NXT ultimately won the match when The Captain of Team NXT Rhea Ripley pinned The Captain of Team Smackdown Sasha Banks, making her the final woman standing. On the November 29 episode of SmackDown, Evans took exception to Sasha Banks and Bayley insulting the SmackDown roster, particularly the women, for losing to Team NXT at Survivor Series. After exchanging insults, Evans hit Banks with the Woman's Right and left the ring, thus turning face for the first time since early 2017. At Royal Rumble, Evans unsuccessfully challenged Bayley for the SmackDown Women's Title. At WrestleMania 36, Evans was part of a five-way elimination match for the SmackDown Women's Champion. Evans lost the match after being pinned by Bayley after interference from Sasha Banks. On the April 24, 2020 episode of Friday Night SmackDown, Evans competed against Banks in a Money in the Bank Qualifying Match for the opportunity to be in the Women's Money in the Bank match at the PPV on May 10. Evans won the match after hitting Banks with the Women's Right (while clutching a fan with a picture of her daughter on it in her hand) and pinning her. As part of the 2020 Draft in October, Evans was drafted to the Raw brand.  Personal life  Estrella-Kadlec and her husband, Alfonso, have a daughter together named Summer.

The Shishalh consider the entire Brittain River watershed of extremely high cultural and spiritual value and home to numerous cultural resources and ceremonial, spiritual, legendary, and oral history sites. In addition the river valley was a traditional travel route to Powell River. Course The Brittain River originates at Arctic Lake in the Pacific Ranges. It flows east through Doris Lake then turns south. It flows through a forested, mountainous, glaciated U-shaped valley to Jervis Inlet. Its mouth is about northeast of the city of Powell River. About upstream from its mouth a waterfall, approximately 10‚Äì15 m high, blocks fish migration. Natural history Historically the Brittain River supported anadromous salmon and trout in its lower , and non-anadromous trout and char in its upper reaches. Anadromous fish populations include coho, Chinook, chum, and pink salmon, as well as steelhead and cutthroat trout. Non-anadromous fish include cutthroat and Dolly Varden. The river's watershed has a long history of heavy logging with associated wildfires, along with mineral exploration. This has significantly altered the aquatic habitats of the lower Brittain River.

In Soviet times, the church was demolished, and the Puppet Theatre was built on its foundations. A new Greek church of the Annunciation was built close to the site of the demolished one in 2014.  History  The Greek Church of the Annunciation was built in Rostov-on-Don at the beginning of the 20th century. The temple was situated in Tkachevsky Lane (present-day Universitetsky) at its intersection with Malo- Sadovaya Street (now Suvorov Street) at the territory, which belonged to the Hellenic Charitable Society. Funds for the construction of a temple were donated by Greeks who lived in the city. The most significant contribution was made by the owner of the tobacco factory Achilles Aslanidi. The church was founded in 1907, and in 1909 the building was completed. Author of the project was the architect I.P. Zlobin. Construction was carried out under the direction of the city architect G.N. Vasilyev. The murals inside were drawn by the artist E.G. Cherepakhin. The temple was built in the Neoclassicist style. Above the main entrance with the portico towered a twenty-meter high bunk belfry. In the church operated a library with books in the Greek language. In 1913-1914, the rector of the church was priest Parisis Sava. In the 1930s the church was closed. During the German occupation of Rostov it was reopened. On November 6, 1942 near the Church of the Annunciation there was held a parade of Romanian troops dedicated to the birthday of the Romanian King Michael I. The event was attended by German officers. The parade ended with a solemn liturgy in the Church of the Annunciation. In 1959 the church was closed again. The building was handed over to School No. 7. The building housed gym and production workshops. In 1964 the church was demolished, and the Puppet Theatre was built on its foundations. Yet the old church walls were partially preserved.  The new church  The Puppet Theatre After the fall of the Soviet Union there was a discussion in Rostov about the possibility of restoration of the Church of Annunciation and transfer of the Puppet Theatre to another place. However, this idea did not find much support, and then it was decided to construct a new church nearby. In 2003, the land area of 0.2099 hectares at Kirov Avenue has been allocated for the construction of the church. Originally it was planned to recreate the initial project, but later it was decided to build a completely new church in neo-Byzantine style. The author of the project was architect G. Shevchenko. The solemn ceremony of foundation of the church took place on 22 September 2007. In 2012, next to the constructing temple there was built a small temporary church where services would be held before the end of construction works. The Rostov museum of local history still possesses a memorial board of the first church that says \\"there was laid a stone in the name of the Annunciation Church\\" in August 1907. This board was planned to be given to the new church after its opening. The main construction works were finished in October 2014. Since January 2015 the church has been active. There also was a scandal about handing the building of the former church, which is now occupied by the puppet theatre, to the Russian Orthodox Church. The Church representatives stated that the theatre would stay in the building until another appropriate place for it was found.

Standing at an altitude of 1150 meters, it overlooks the resort towns of Bikfaya, Khinshara, and Shwayr, and a string of small mountainside villages such as Zighrine, Shwayya, Ayn Teffaha, Shrine, and Jouar. The entire region is covered with lush pine forests, and the area surrounding the monastery is unusually diverse in flora, with oak, eucalyptus, willow, and maple trees, orchards of apples, pears, prunes, and peaches, and vines terraced on the slopes. The stones of the monastery are hewn from the cliff, and, from a distance, the monastery dissolves into its background, seeming to rise beyond the cliff as a natural continuation. Elias or Elijah, the Old Testament prophet, is a Christian saint also venerated by Muslims and especially the Druze. Together with St. George and St. Michael, he forms a trinity of military saints to whom several churches and monasteries in Lebanon are dedicated. As defender of the true faith, he did not hesitate to use force in slitting the throats of the priests of the Canaanite god Ba'al, worshipped by the king of Israel, Ahab, and his wife Jezebel. Even though he is an Old Testament figure, Elias is regarded as an example of the monastic life because of his long residence in the wilderness, during which he was fed by ravens. The Greek Orthodox monastery lies next to a Maronite monastery also dedicated to Elias, which belongs to the Mariamite (previously Aleppine) order.Monasteries of Antiochian Orthodox Patriarchate, University of Balamand Publications, 2007. The monastery is a summer residence of the patriarchate, and meetings of the Holy Antiochian Synod are regularly held there. St. Elias Shwayya also remains a popular place of pilgrimage. On the saint's feast day of July 20, people from all regions take part in liturgical celebrations held at the monastery.  History  Archives, inscriptions, and architecture provide sketchy and sometimes contradictory information on the monastery's origin. The oldest document found at the monastery is a land-purchase deed dated 1004 in the Islamic calendar, corresponding to 1595‚Äì1596. In his history of Bikfaya, Edmond Blaybel states that the Greek Orthodox monastery of St. Elias Shwayya was built in 1612 on a plot of land belonging to the priest Boutros al-Klink, who also granted the new monastery lands in the domains of Abou Mizane and Zighrine. However, there is architectural evidence of an older foundation date in the monastic basement, which includes six cells joined by small doorways and two larger rooms that probably served as a twin-nave church. The rooms are hewn from the cliff and completed on the open side by a barrel-vaulted roof and thick wall, a form known from both the early Christian (fifth-sixth centuries) and the Crusader period (twelfth-thirteenth centuries). In either case, then, it seems that the monastery of St. Elias, like most Orthodox monasteries, was refounded during the Ottoman period after a long period of abandonment. St. Elias Shwayya suffered from the schism of 1724. The monastery was granted to Greek Catholics and Greek Orthodox, depending on which community paid more revenues to the local Druze Abilama‚Äò emirs. In 1728, the Russian traveler Barsky reported the presence of five monks at St. Elias Shwayya. A document published by the historian Asad Rustom records that the Greek Orthodox finally recovered the monastery in 1749, when Yunis Nicolas al-Jbayli paid 1500 piastres to the emirs Isma‚Äòil and Hassan Abillama‚Äò. Yunis entrusted the monastery to Orthodox monks and the Abilama‚Äò emirs undertook to protect them and hear their grievances. It is a typical document revealing the precarious status of waqf lands during this period. The endowment of monasteries in this manner was frequent, being a convenient way of increasing agricultural production and tax revenues.Monasteries of Antiochian Orthodox Patriarchate, University of Balamand Publications, 2007. However, the modern history of St. Elias Shwayya may be said to begin in 1760, when it was rebuilt after a severe earthquake by a Beiruti notable, Yunis Nicolas al-Jbayli and the superior Sophronios al- Sayqali. A commemorative inscription over the church's north door records this event. Despite chronic political and clan rivalries in Mount Lebanon, St. Elias Shwayya prospered during the later eighteenth century and throughout the nineteenth century. It received the deposits of rich Greek Orthodox merchants from Beirut and the Biqa‚Äò, and it loaned funds to peasant freeholders and sharecroppers of the region. Several agricultural domains were acquired and the monastery gained more waqf land in neighboring Abou-Mizane and Qinnabeh near Broumana. St. Elias Shwayya also became an important centre of silk production. Throughout this period, the monastery's prosperity depended largely on good relations between monastic superiors and local notables. For example, Makarios, superior from 1833 to 1872, was an ally and friend of Emir Haydar Abilama‚Äò, whose wife and children he sheltered when Haydar was exiled by the Egyptian government in 1840. When the Ottoman regime was restored in 1845, Mount Lebanon was divided into Druze and Christian districts and Haydar became governor of the Christian district. About this time, the monastery contained eight monks and eight servants, and its prosperity is indicated by the building of more cells in 1841. The English traveler David Urquhart visited St Elias Shwayya in 1850 and reported that the monastery had profited from a good silk harvest and a new building was to be constructed beside the church. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the monastery established a school, which employed teachers of renown. Primary schools were later maintained at Qinnabeh and Abou-Mizane for the children of its local sharecroppers. A strong Russian influence developed at St. Elias Shwayya from the later nineteenth century. Russian consuls donated grants to the school, and, both before and after the establishment of the Russian Imperial Palestine Society, Russian orientalists and diplomats such as Barsky, Basily, Krymsky, and Krachkovsky stayed for varying periods at St. Elias Shwayya. Russian monks came to stay when the Patriarch Gregory IV (Haddad) returned from Russia in 1910. They resided for nearly five years and made several additions and alterations to the monastery. Their simplicity and piety gained them the sympathy of the local inhabitants, but they were forced to leave when Turkey declared war against Russia in 1915. Patriarch Gregory IV undertook the building of a road connecting the monastery to the village of Shwayr and the highway. He paid great attention to the monastery's agricultural production and its peasant sharecroppers. In 1906, for example, he advised the superior Gerasimos al-Dimashqi to build new houses for the sharecroppers of Abou- Mizane, and he planted twelve thousand mulberry trees on the monastic lands. During the first half of the twentieth century, the monastic school continued to function. Some bishops completed their primary studies there before moving on to Balamand. During the Lebanese civil war, the monastery was seriously damaged by artillery fire, but the superior undertook meticulous repairs, which were completed in 1996. Architecture The entire monastery is built of yellow orchre stone from the cliff-side and its architecture reveals four different styles.  Medieval basement  The basement contains two barrel- vaulted rooms separated by arcades and illuminated by a tiny window. They resemble twin-nave churches found in North Lebanon, and they probably formed the old monastic church. Adjacent to them are six barrel-vaulted cells abutting against the rock of the cliff. Their narrow embrasure-like entrances are cut into a wall up to ninety centimeters in thickness. These cells are arranged in diminishing size from east to west. The communicating doorways also become progressively smaller, so that the visitor must eventually bend down to pass through. Such features suggest a gradual initiation into a monastic life centred upon contemplation and prayer. These cells are comparable to the oldest cells in the monastery of Saydnaya in Syria. The first cell holds the coffin of Makarios Sadaqa, bishop of Beirut at the end of the nineteenth century, whose body is still well preserved. No inscription exists to date the basement complex, but it probably goes back to the thirteenth century at least. The rooms were long used as storage cellars and stables, but they are all now empty. An iron-grilled door separates them from a staircase leading up to the ground floor.Monasteries of Antiochian Orthodox Patriarchate, University of Balamand Publications, 2007.  Ground-floor constructions  These include the church, cells, and reception room built around two small interior courtyards, the whole ensemble being built by Yunis Nicolas al-Jbayli in 1760. It is reached through a main entrance corridor leading from an outer terrace with a fine mountain view. The first courtyard is triangular. It is bounded by the south wall of the church and by a series of eleven barrel-vaulted cells fronted by a simple arcade. Only slightly larger than the basement cells, these cells have large windows and a massive outer wall. The local inhabitants gather in this courtyard on Sundays and feast days to ring the bell above the Arabic-style church door. This was probably the door of the original church, destroyed by earthquake in 1759. A plaque commemorates the reconstruction, its Arabic letters carrying a symbolic numerical value that gives the date April 4, 1760. The door and inscription are surmounted by a lintel engraved with religious motifs. The second courtyard is joined to the first by three steps. Narrower than the first, it is surrounded by the west fa√ßade of the church, the reception room, and a corridor connecting the church with the building constructed by the Russian monks at the start of the twentieth century. The church door in the middle of the west fa√ßade is fronted by a porch similar in its decoration to those in the houses of Dayr al-Qamar and Bayt ad-Din. The decorative elements found here were probably introduced from Italy after Mount Lebanon was opened to Western trade. Otherwise, however, the church is remarkable for its simplicity. Two windows in the north wall allow but feeble light to enter. Despite the church's small size, the ribbed vault of the ceiling gives a feeling of spaciousness. The arcs of the vault join to form an eight-branched star adorned in the centre by a beautiful flower. The walnut iconostasis was finely carved by Greek artisans at the beginning of the twentieth century. The royal gate is flanked by the figures of the twelve disciples and surmounted by a relief representing an elephant, pigeons, two-headed angels symbolizing the two natures of Christ or three heads symbolizing the Holy Trinity, and the lamb symbolizing the sacrifice of Christ. Reliefs in the center of the lower register illustrate the Annunciation, the beheading of St. John the Baptist, the Nativity, and St. Elias executing the priests of Ba'al. All these reliefs correspond in subject to the icons above them. Vegetal motifs interweave throughout the iconostasis. To the right, the throne of the bishop or superior is topped by a cupola decorated with flowers, arabesques, and an angel holding a serpent, symbolizing victory over evil. To the left is an elevated pulpit for the deacon's readings. Raised two meters above the floor, it is decorated by a pigeon depositing the Bible and two angels holding candlesticks, all surrounded by a motif of arabesques and fruits. Both pieces seem to have been executed by the same sculptor.Monasteries of Antiochian Orthodox Patriarchate, University of Balamand Publications, 2007.  Nineteenth-century buildings  Some of these were built by Patriarch Methodios (1841-1842); later in the century, a school was constructed at the level of the old basement. Architecturally, the school is comparable to those of Bkeftin and Balamand, although it is smaller than either. The masonry is precisely worked and the finishing of a high standard. There are two large halls, one barrel-vaulted and the other ribbed-vaulted, and several small classrooms along a corridor. Surprisingly, it lacks a central courtyard, perhaps because the winter weather was too cold for outdoor recreation. For this, however, pupils could use the two courtyards on the upper floor, accessible through the vaulted staircase leading up from the basement, or they could simply go into the neighbouring forest and orchards. The interior staircase functioned like those in traditional Lebanese mountain homes: the inhabitants on the upper floor used it to bring food and fuel from the cellar without having to go outside. The two halls probably boarded the pupils, a feature of most traditional Lebanese schools because of poor communications. Each hall is well lighted, with two great windows opening onto the valley.  The Russian monks‚Äô building  In 1910, the monastery was granted to Russian monks. Although they only stayed a short time, they constructed a four-floor building to the right of the monastery entrance. Each upper floor contains three rooms, and the ground floor is partitioned into stables and cellars, now used to store firewood. The roof is made of parallel wooden beams and cross planks. Since the region is very cold in winter, the Russian monks built inlaid wall-chimneys drawing from small wood-burning stoves in each room. They also established a mechanically controlled irrigation system: the flow of water to the gardens and orchards was regulated by a network of cords operated by lines from the monastery.  Manuscripts and icons  At the height of its prosperity, the monastery was the center of the region's religious and cultural life. It possesses sixty- three manuscripts, including fifty-four liturgical manuals prescribing celebrations and prayers throughout the year. The other nine manuscripts contain such standard theological works as the sermons of St. John Chrysostom, St. John Damascene's On the Orthodox Faith, and John Climacus‚Äô Ladder of Virtues. Perhaps the most important manuscript is the typicon of St. Saba, an ancient rule of monastic and liturgical life, copied at the monastery of St. John the Baptist Douma in 1595. The only secular manuscript in the collection records the voyage to Palestine of a Beiruti notable, Faris Abu Halqa.Monasteries of Antiochian Orthodox Patriarchate, University of Balamand Publications, 2007. The icons preserved at St. Elias Shwayya are few but diverse. The oldest, representing St. Elias, is dated to the tenth or eleventh century. Housed in a glass frame to the left of the church, it has suffered deterioration and its style and manner of execution are difficult to discern. However, the prophet can be seen in a cave; as related in the biblical Book of Kings, a raven sent by God is bringing him food. He is represented in a contemplative attitude, his right hand against his cheek and his head slightly lifted. He wears an enveloping tunic with wide folds and austere colors. Three icons placed upon the iconostasis were executed by the Bishop of Tripoli, Barthenios, in 1761, just after the church's restoration. They are typical of the Aleppine iconographic school, with Arabic inscriptions, brown faces, almond eyes, and sumptuous gilded costumes that reveal something of the prosperity and tastes of urban Syrian Christians at that time. The background is a dark gold tending towards orange. The luminous color of these icons blends with the dark tint of the wooden iconostasis to give a warm effect. The first icon represents Christ as a bishop, blessing with his right hand and holding the open Bible in his left. He wears a tiara, above which is a halo decorated with spiral arabesques, and his gilded tunic displays floral and checkerboard motifs. The icon is covered with shimmering gilded lines outlining the hair and clothing, so that it almost resembles a work of gold jewelry. The second icon represents the Mother of God as Queen of Heaven with a golden crown. Her right hand points to the infant Christ, also crowned, whom she cradles upright. A red rose clasped in her left hand, she wears a golden tunic and a maroon mantle studded with golden stars. The red and gold colors are warm and intimate; the faces, though rigid, are filled with a serene, solemn beauty. The third icon represents the patron of the church, the prophet Elias, slaying the priests of Ba'al. He brandishes a long scimitar above his head, and his left hand is stretched towards the heads piled on the ground. The strongly drawn folds of the maroon tunic display the movement of the body. Three other icons on the iconostasis are very different in style. They are most likely of Russian origin, brought by the Russian monks in 1910. They represent St. George slaying the dragon, St. John the Baptist, and St. Spiridon. The chiaroscuro shading of the icons gives a cold light, in contrast to the dark iconostasis. The figures are pale and the faces have a wan expression. Another icon lacks signature and date but was probably painted at the beginning of the nineteenth century. An inscription records that it was donated in waqf by a certain Farah for the repose of his father's soul. The icon displays an original composition with four different scenes from the life of the prophet Elias. The river Jordan is shown in the center with brown hills to either side. To the left, St. Elias kneels, his hands uplifted to heaven; before him, a calf is consumed as a burnt-offering to God. Below right, he is seated under a tree as an angel brings him food. Above right, the kneeling Elie sees Christ appearing in a blue sphere borne by two angels amid rosy clouds. In his right hand, Christ holds a phylactery inscribed: ‚ÄòThe people of Israel have renounced God and demolished his temples.‚Äô Above the hill, St. Elias is borne upwards in a chariot of fire drawn by four horses. He hands his folded cloak to his disciple Elisha, who stands on the summit. Elisha is about to strike the waters of the Jordan with his master's cloak so that he can walk across it dry-shod. The ascent of Elias into heaven on a chariot of fire has usually inspired very decorative compositions. Here, in contrast, the composition is simple yet powerful, tending almost to abstraction.

The building now houses Elk Rapids Area Historical Museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. History The newly minted Methodist minister Reverend David R. Latham first visited Elk Rapids on June 21, 1857. He had intended to travel to Kansas, but was convinced to stay in the area. He soon was appointed to a preaching circuit that included Elk Rapids and other nearby towns. There were soon enough Methodists in Elk Rapids to establish a congregation, and the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Elk Rapids was formed in the early 1870s. In 1876, the congregation purchased a former schoolhouse for use as a church. In 1882, they moed to the former courthouse. However, the church soon outgrew their quarters, and in 1901 they purchased the site for this building and began construction. The church was completes in 1902 at a cost of about $8500. The congregations continued to use the building until 2011, when the church organization was discontinued. The building was donated to the Elk Rapids Area Historical Society, who renovated the structure. It now serves as that group's headquarters and historical museum. Description The former Elk Rapids First Methodist Episcopal Church is a brick and wood cross-gable-roof building faced in locally produced pale yellow brick, and standing on a foundation of rock-faced fieldstone. The gabled areas are faced with wood shingles. It has a single main story above a half-buried basement. The church is basically square in plan, with two short projecting wings. A square-plan tower containing the main entrance is located in the northeast corner between the wings, and projects nearly full depth from the front walls. The tower is topped with an open gabled belfry and a tall spire. The main entry has a large wood double door, reached by a flight of stairs. Three more entrances are paced around the building. An important characteristic of the building is the distinctive Gothic-arch windows, placed in a variety of shapes and sizes. The main facades each have a broad three- part central Gothic window, with a single narrow Gothic window to each side. A third elevation has another three-part Gothic window with two single, separate, narrow Gothic windows to one side, and the remaining facade has three single narrow Gothic windows. The tower also has one window. Thirteen of the windows contain stained glass, eight of which are original to the initial construction of the building. The stained glass windows have pointed arch tops with wood molding. The eight windows depict dove, fleur-de-lis, water lily and other flower designs, crowns, crosses, bibles, oil lamps and other Christian symbols. The five windows installed at later dates (1948, 1949, 1952, 1977, and 1980) contain more depictions of religious scenes, including two modeled after paintings by German artist Johann Heinrich Hoffmann. The main entrance leads to an entry vestibule and on into the main auditorium. The auditorium has an inclined floor leading toward the stage that once contained the pulpit and altar. Pews once ringed the auditorium, set in a semi-circle, but only one section of pews has been retained. The interior walls are of painted plaster over the exterior masonry. The ceiling above is covered with decorative pressed metal paneling. An opening off the auditorium leads to a front room, now used as a welcoming/meeting area. A stairway from the main level leads downward, where there is a large meeting space, and a smaller room housing mechanicals.

It is administered by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch. The convent was built in 1935 around the grotto of St. Thecla. Location St Thecla Ma‚Äòlula is located northeast of Damascus at an altitude of 1600 meters under the mountainous region of Qalamoun. The village of Ma‚Äòlula' is isolated and naturally protected, which may largely explain its inhabitants‚Äô continuing adherence to Christianity and the Aramaic language. This convent is a major place of Christian pilgrimage in Syria. The name \\"Ma‚Äòlula\\", meaning ‚Äòentrance‚Äô in Aramaic, refers to the village's position at the opening of a narrow pass between two steep hills. Legend of St Thecla According to the legend of St Thecla, Thecla was a girl who belonged to a noble pagan family from Qalamoun. At age 18, Thecla ran away from home. Her father had arranged her marriage to a pagan, but she wanted to be a Christian. In the most common version of her story, Roman soldiers chased her to the third range of Qalamoun. Reaching the vicinity of Ma‚Äòlula, she found the way blocked by a rocky height; yet, the moment she prayed for God's mercy, the barrier was miraculously divided. This miracle allowed her to pass through into the grotto and escape capture and death. Thecla spent the rest of her life there. In the grotto, Thecla dug into a natural spring. The faithful believe these to be sacred waters that can cure paralysis, rheumatism, and infertility. Thecla spent her life healing the sick and preaching the Christian faith, finally dying at age 90. She is buried in the grotto. Pilgrims St. Thecla's reputation as a healing saint has drawn many visitors to the convent to pay visits and fulfill vows. Pilgrim families now stay at the guest-house attached to the convent. Previously, however, visitors spent the afternoon and night in the grotto, prostrated themselves at dawn before the iconostasis, and drank the holy water of the spring. If the supplicant were a pregnant woman, she would eat a tuft of wick from the oil- lamp in the grotto. Supplicants who were too sick to go to Ma‚Äòlula in person gave visitors their written prayers to place before the tomb of St. Thecla. Veneration of the saints in Syria is frequent even among Muslims. Despite the spread of Islam in the region, local inhabitants have retained a firm faith in St Thecla, permitting the survival and prosperity of the convent. Many prayers offered to St Thecla in her grotto are preceded by Qur'anic recitations. Reportedly, childless Muslim women frequently became pregnant as a result of her intercession. Some of these couples would even have a longed-for child baptized as a mark of reverence for the saint. Activities The convent of St Thecla depends directly on the Patriarchate of Antioch and is administered by a mother superior, now Pelagia Sayyaf. Seven nuns and the mother superior live at the convent. As in most Orthodox monasteries, their daily life consists mainly in fulfilling obligations of prayer. Each nun performs prayers by herself every morning, and three days each week are allocated for communal prayers. Because the convent of St Thecla is a shrine for the people of Qalamoun and Christians throughout the Near East, the nuns are always prepared to welcome visitors and guide them throughout the convent. Parish activities are constant at the convent, especially the liturgies on Sundays and feast days. The nuns share the tasks of cleaning and tidying the convent buildings; by tradition, however, special care of St Thecla's grotto church is given to the eldest nun. In addition to these duties, the nuns practice manual crafts, such as sewing and embroidery, making rosaries, and decorating icons with pearls. Since Pelagia Sayyaf's appointment as mother superior, the nuns have also run a small orphanage. The nuns derive all their daily needs from the town of Ma‚Äòlula; they seldom leave the convent, except to supervise agricultural work in the nearby fields or, occasionally, to travel to Damascus for goods that are locally unavailable. On such visits, they may take the opportunity to visit the Patriarchate. History The Qalamoun region became Christian in the fourth century, the period when the first monasteries were founded: indeed, Christian manuscripts from this period have been preserved by the monks of Ma‚Äòlula. Following its arrival in the seventh century, Islam penetrated the Qalamoun region slowly, gradually becoming established in the first range and the surrounding plains before spreading to the second range in the ninth century. However, stubborn Christian resistance halted Islamic penetration of the third range until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The monastery of St Thecla and the church of St John the Baptist were rebuilt in 1756, according to the chronicle of Mikha‚Äôil al-Burayk. The Russian consul Uspensky records four monks at St Thecla in 1840. In 1906, a church was built at the grotto over the remains of an ancient church of unknown date. The convent building was begun in 1935, and a second floor was added in 1959. The convent today The ground floor of the St Thecla convent contains a reception room, refectory, and display rooms for the sale of religious artifacts; the second floor is entirely occupied by the cells of the nuns. Just below the building is a kitchen, including a baking-stone used for making bread; above it, another building dating to 1888 has recently been restored as a patriarchal residence. A guest-house for tourists and visitors was built in 1934. A ladder at the top of the main convent building leads directly to the shrine of St Thecla, a rock-grotto that dates back to the earliest Christian centuries. The grotto is divided into a sacred spring and two small churches, which have recently been modernized. Icons The icons are located in the iconostasis of the convent church of St John the Baptist, in the saint's grotto, and in the mother superior's wing. With the exception of a few contemporary twentieth-century icons, they date from the mid-eighteenth to the late-nineteenth century. Eighteenth-century icons Three examples of the work of Patriarch Sylvestros are exhibited in the church of St John the Baptist. *The first icon represents Christ, blessing with his right hand and holding the Gospel upon his lap with his left. St John the Baptist stands to the left, leaning towards Christ and blessing with his right hand, while his left is folded upon an open document in Arabic, reading: \\"Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world.\\" *The second icon represents the Virgin Mary, the Child on her left arm, leaning towards his mother with his eyes upon the spectator. To the right of the couple stands St Thecla, carrying a decorative metal cross in her right hand and making the sign of peace with her left. *The third icon represents the Annunciation: the Angel Gabriel offers a rose to Mary, who reaches for it. The grotto contains two icons. *The first icon shows the Resurrection; Christ, transfigured in light, blesses with his right hand and carries a banner in his left. To the right sits an angel, and to the left, women bearing perfumes; at the bottom are three guards in different positions. Behind the scene is the city and surrounding gardens, the first light of morning rising upon them. *The second icon represents the Nativity of the Virgin, in which the infant Mary is raised upon the angel's hand to be crowned and invested with the Holy Spirit. The mother superior's wing of the convent contains several more icons. One icon represents the archangel Michael, another icon Moses the Black. A third icon represents St Elias sitting at the door of his cave while ravens bring him food. The sanctuary of the convent church contains an icon showing two saints, probably St. Cosmas and Damian. Nineteenth century icons The nineteenth-century icons are also found in the convent church. The main group, on the upper register of the iconostasis, represents the Nativity of the Virgin, the Purification, the Dormition, the Baptism of Christ, the Transfiguration, the Descent from the Cross, the Resurrection, and Pentecost. Separately, there are three large icons painted on fabric. The first fabric icon represents St Thecla and the other two an assortment of biblical and hagiographical scenes. A wooden cross in the convent church displays the Crucified Lord in the center, surrounded by the Virgin, St John the Apostle and the symbols of the four Evangelists. Nearby is an icon of Sts Sergius and Bacchus on horseback in military uniform. The last group of icons belongs to the Jerusalem school, known for its fusion of traditional Eastern iconography and European painting styles. Among them are four icons by the greatest representative of the school, Mikha‚Äôil Mhanna al-Qudsi.

Life He was born in London on 5 June 1794. He was chorister at St Paul's Cathedral under John Bernard Sale from 1801 to 1810, and during those years had lessons on the organ from Samuel Wesley and Matthew Cook, and on the piano from Johann Baptist Cramer. Aged eleven Hart often played as deputy for Thomas Attwood, the organist of St Paul's Cathedral. In 1810 he became organist of St Mary's Church, Walthamstow, and joined the Earl of Uxbridge's household as organist for three years. He subsequently became organist of All Hallows' Church, Tottenham. On the introduction of the quadrille at Almack's by Lady Jersey after 1815, Hart, who was described as teacher and pianist at private balls, began his long series of adaptations of national and operatic airs to the fashionable dance measures. His most notable achievement was the compilation in 1819 of a set of Les Lanciers, a type of quadrille, which remained popular for many years. From 1818 to 1821 Hart was chorus-master and pianist of the English Opera House (the Lyceum Theatre, London), and wrote the songs for Amateurs and Actors by Richard Brinsley Peake (1818), The Bull's Head and A Walk for a Wager (1819), The Vampyre (1820), and other musical farces and melodramas. From 1829 until his death Hart lived in Hastings, where he opened a music-seller's shop, conducted a small band, and played the organ at St Mary's Chapel. He died on 10 December 1844 in Hastings, aged 50. Publications Some of Hart's most successful quadrilles were based on the music of Mozart's Don Giovanni (1818), Locke's Macbeth, Rossini's Pietro l'eremita (1822) and La donna del lago (1823), Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz 1824, and English, Irish and Scottish melodies. He composed forty-eight sets in all. He was also the author of some waltzes and galoppades. An Easy Mode of Teaching Thorough Bass and Composition is ascribed to him.

In February 2018, in a minor network reshuffle, Darren Curtis and Alison Ariotti were removed from presenting the weekend news; they were replaced by then-Nine News Regional Queensland presenter Jonathan Uptin. Ratings Throughout the 1990s, and right up until the mid-2000s, Nine News Queensland was the clear-cut ratings leader in Brisbane. However, when weatherman John Schluter resigned just short of what would have been his 25th anniversary with the Nine Network towards the end of 2006 (subsequently joining the rival Seven News Brisbane),Schulter shaft Cummins Australian-media.com.au, retrieved 26 February 2007. sports presenter Wally Lewis took sick leave after collapsing on-air during a nightly bulletin in November of the same year, and rival Seven Brisbane poached then-Today news presenter Sharyn Ghidella from Nine shortly after to read its weekend news (and later weeknights), the ratings declined, and in 2007, Nine News Queensland would lose its long-standing ratings dominance in the local market to the rival Seven News Brisbane. After Andrew Lofthouse and Melissa Downes took over as the chief co-presenters in mid-2009, Nine News Queensland would start to chip away at Seven's lead, and by 2013 they would reclaim its mantle as the top-rating news bulletin in Brisbane. As of 2018, Nine News Queensland has lost its ratings lead to Seven News Brisbane once again. \\"Choppergate\\" controversy The Nine News Queensland bulletins on 20 and 21 August 2011 included live coverage each night by reporters Melissa Mallet and Cameron Price, respectively, from the station's helicopter, which they claimed was \\"near Beerwah\\", where the remains of murdered schoolboy Daniel Morcombe had been found earlier that month. The reports were revealed to be fake when, on the second night, rival station Channel Seven recorded video of the Nine helicopter sitting on the helipad outside their studios at Mount Coot-tha at the time of the broadcast. Radar footage also revealed that, on the first night, the helicopter was actually hovering over Chapel Hill, 70 km away from Beerwah. Both Mallet and Price, as well as news producer Aaron Wakeley, were sacked by the Nine Network following the incident, and news director Lee Anderson accepted responsibility and resigned over the faked reports. Despite the scandal, Nine experienced a spike in its 6:00 pm news ratings in the weeks that followed, managed to win more weeks than it did in the previous three years combined (winning seven of the 32 ratings weeks up to the first week of October), and recovered to reclaim its mantle as Queensland's most-watched news service by 2013.

Shuchat has answered queries in varied areas of halakha (Jewish law) such as eruv (ritual enclosures), electricity on Shabbat and gittin (divorce law). He has edited the works of Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Chabad Lubavitch Rebbe.  Early life and education  Sholom Shuchat was born in 1984 to Leibel Shuchat, rosh yeshiva (dean) of Yeshiva Gedola (Talmudical academy) of Caracas, Venezuela. He attended school at Talmud Torah Sinai in Caracas. At age 14 he began his studies in the Chabad yeshiva system. At age 16 he entered the Yeshiva Gedola Rabbinical College of Greater Miami where he received his BA and MA in Hebrew Letters. In June 2004, at the age of 19, Shuchat received his semikhah (rabbinic ordination) from Dovid Schochet (Chief Rabbi of Toronto) and Dovid Schmukler (dean of Kollel Tiferes Menachem in Los Angeles, California). Immediately thereafter he began his advanced rabbinic studies, which concluded with his receiving his dayanut (rabbinic judicial ordination) in 2012 from Avot Batei HaDin (religious judges) Zalman Nechemia Goldberg of Jerusalem, Aryeh Ralbag of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis, Yosef Feigelstock of Buenos Aires, and Yoram Ulman of Sydney, Australia. In 2012 he received semikhah in the laws of gittin (Jewish divorces) from Aryeh Ralbag Chief Rabbi of Amsterdam, and in the laws of family purity from Yosef Yisroel Eisenberger, Chief Rabbi of New Square, New York. In 2015 he received semikhah in the laws of kidushin (Jewish weddings) from Yitzhak Yosef and David Lau (Chief Rabbis of Israel) among others.  Rabbinic career  Dayan  In May 2012, Shuchat was appointed as a dayan in the beth din (rabbinical court) of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis. Additionally, he serves as a dayan in various batei din in the New York metropolitan area such as the Vaad Harabonim of Queens, the Rabbinical Board of East Flatbush, Brooklyn, the beth din Kolel Harabonim in Rockland County, New York, the New York Bet Din (Chok Natan) in New York City and the Rabbinical Alliance of America. Shuchat is recognized by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel for performing gittin, kidushin and giyur (conversion to Judaism).  Rabbinic Training Program  Since 2020, Shuchat serves as the Rosh kollel of the Kollel L'horaah Maasit of Crown Heights, a Rabbinic institute for full-time, advanced study of the rabbinic legal literature, with practical training. The Kollel focuses on educating and training young aspiring Rabbis from the Lubavitch community in various fields of Jewish Law; .  Mikvah & eruv consultancy  Since 2016, Shuchat has traveled the United States supervising the construction of mikvaot (Jewish ritual baths), and certifying them after their completion, ensuring they are built in accordance with the highest standards of halakha (Jewish law). He was involved in the construction of mikvaot across North and South America. Due to his expertise in the intricate laws of eruv (ritual enclosures), Shuchat is regularly called upon to design and review their placement in big cities across the United States.  Lectures on Jewish law  Shuchat lectures in contemporary halakhic issues, specializing in modern technology and innovation as it applies to Jewish law,; and is part of the faculty of the \\"Online Smicha\\" rabbinical ordination program. Since 2016, Shuchat is a regular panelist at the yearly Kinus HaShluchim (International conference of Chabad emissaries) where he lectures on halakha and his knowledge of directives of Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Chabad-Lubavitcher Rebbe. He is also a featured speaker at the Kinus Torah in the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters, which takes place on the day after the conclusion of each of the holidays of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot; and other rabbinic conferences and events.  Arbitration and mediation  Shuchat trained with the New York Center for Interpersonal Development, and is a member of the Association for Conflict Resolution (ACR). He serves as an arbitrator and mediator in disputes between and within Jewish organizations.  Responsa  Shuchat's first responsa, written in 2012, received the approbation of Rishon LeZion Ovadia Yosef. As posek (Jewish law authority), Shuchat has authored hundreds of She'elot u-Teshuvot (responsa) to queries he received from rabbis the world over.  Controversies  * In October 2013, Shuchat was implicated in the Edison divorce torture plot, a sting operation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the goal of which was to bring about the arrests of a number of rabbis who plotted to abduct and torture a non-existent Jewish man in order to coerce him into issuing a get (divorce document) to his 'wife'.Molloy, Allie (October 22, 2013) \\"Judge Sets Bail for Jewish Scribe, 3 Others in Kidnapping-Divorce Case\\", CNN. Retrieved July 9, 2019. Shuchat pleaded guilty in New Jersey Federal Court to traveling in interstate commerce to commit an act of violence.Samaha, Albert (June 24, 2014) \\"Enforcer in Orthodox Jewish Divorce Extortion Operation Pleads Guilty\\", The Village Voice. Retrieved July 8, 2019. He was sentenced to time served and no additional jail time, along with two years of supervised release with the first six months being house arrest. * After a second measles outbreak in the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn in 2014 (following an earlier outbreak in 2013), Shuchat wrote an article berating the anti-vaxxers, stating \\"When someone does an action which can cause death, or even refuses to do an action which can prevent death, he is compared to a murderer\\"., quoted in * On May 29, 2014 the Chabad Lubavitch- affiliated publishing house Kol Menachem released Chaim Miller's book Turning Judaism Outwards: A Biography of the Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, which was promoted and branded as \\"A Human Portrait of the Rebbe\\". Shuchat was asked by Chabad leaders to review the book and respond to the alleged disrespect showed by the author to the Rebbe. In mid-June 2014, Shuchat published a review of the book, titled \\"Taking the Wrong Turn Outwards: A Critical Review\\", describing some of the inaccuracies in the book. * In 2015, when some members of the Crown Heights community advocated for the Jewish prenuptial agreement, Shuchat was one of the rabbis opposing it, explaining its fallacies while proposing a possible alternative. * In 2015, when the KosherSwitch was introduced (an innovative light switch for circumventing the prohibition against using electricity on Shabbat), Shuchat expounded upon why it cannot be used on Shabbat, his position later being affirmed by other rabbis. * In 2016, when an eruv was built around the Crown Heights Jewish community, the local community rabbis strongly voiced their opposition, with some even comparing the eruv users with members of Reform Judaism. The only Chabad rabbi to check the eruv and ultimately render it permissible was Shuchat, who ruled that although it is kosher, it should not be used until it is modified to satisfy the most stringent opinions. * In 2017, the \\"TahorApp\\" was created with the purpose of enabling women who are niddah to discreetly send questions to the rabbis, without the need to go in person. A few hours after its launch, Shuchat released a statement to the effect that this app \\"may not be used... and any psak (religious ruling) obtained from said app is invalid\\" until a rabbi is consulted in person. Later, four additional rabbis added their names to the prohibition, and the certifying rabbi Fishel Jacobs pulled his endorsement from the app. * In 2017, Shuchat joined a group of Chabad rabbis who signed a proclamation addressing child sexual abuse cases in Brooklyn's haredi community and in the Chabad community in particular. The rabbis affirmed that \\"there is no need to seek rabbinic approval prior to reporting\\" all forms of abuse to the authorities. The letter was organized by Dovid Nyer, a licensed clinical social worker in New City, New York with Shuchat's help. * Immediately after Passover in 2018, the hechsher (kosher supervision) department of the Central Rabbinical Congress released a letter prohibiting the consumption of any beer sold by Manhattan Beer Distributors due to a perceived problem with the sale of chametz (leaven) performed for the company by the OK Kosher Certification. The problem, which was widely reported in haredi publications and termed \\"The Great Beer Episode of 2018\\" was immediately investigated by Shuchat, who determined that the sale of chametz was valid. His detailed responsa was later published in various rabbinical journals.Oholei Torah Yeshiva, Rabbinical Journal Haoros U'Biurim, Year 39, Vol. 16 (1146), published Spring 2018, p. 58-69; Rabbi Chaim Oberlander, Rabbi Gedalia Oberlander, Rabbinical Journal Ohr Yisroel, Year 24, Vol. 1 (77), published Fall 2018, p. 52-66. He was later joined by Gavriel Zinner, Av Beth Din of Nitei Gavriel of Brooklyn, Asher Eckstein, Chief Rabbi of the Belz community in Brooklyn and Menachem Meir Weissmandel of Monsey, New York, who all acknowledged that the sale of chametz was performed properly.Rabbi Chaim Oberlander, Rabbi Gedalia Oberlander, Rabbinical Journal Ohr Yisroel, Year 24, Vol. 1 (77), published Fall 2018, p. 34-51. * In the fall of 2018, Shuchat spearheaded the campaign to discredit the International Beit Din headed by Simcha Krauss after it allowed a married woman to remarry without first obtaining a get, rendering any future children born as mamzerim (illegitimate). He was later joined by the Brooklyn beth din (religious court) of the Central Rabbinical Congress, the beth din of the Edah HaChareidis in Jerusalem, Moishe Sternbuch of Jerusalem, the Bnei Brak, Israel beth din of Nissim Karelitz, the Sydney, Australia beth din, the Monsey Eizer Mishpot beth din of Pinchas Rabinowitz, the Brooklyn Avnei Shaish Faltishan beth din of Yitzchok Stein and the Brooklyn beth din of Gavriel Zinner. In January 2019, Shuchat was invited to deliver an address to a conference of veteran haredi rabbis and dayanim (rabbinic judges) in Boro Park regarding this matter.  Personal life  Shuchat married Chaya in 2009, and together they have three daughters.  Publications  Shuchat serves as an associate editor of the Rebbe's works, and was involved in producing the following: * Hadran - Siyum Maseches Chagiga (editor) - A discourse by the Rebbe on the occasion of completing the Tractate Chagigah of the Babylonian Talmud.

Created by writers Paul Caimi and Michael Hickey, the character serves as the protagonist and antivillain of the first film, Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984), and is featured in flashbacks in the sequel, Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 (1987). In the first film, Billy is first introduced at age five, when he witnesses his parents' murder on a country road on Christmas Eve by a hitchhiker in a Santa Claus costume. The event leaves him with a pathological aversion to Christmas. Billy is placed in an orphanage under Mother Superior, and experiences abuse there throughout his childhood that compounds his mental state. At age eighteen, Billy acquires a job working at Ira's Toy Store; however, as Christmas arrives, he finds himself under increasing psychological duress, and eventually murders his co- workers at an employee Christmas party. Billy then embarks on a murder spree on Christmas Eve, killing numerous people he encounters. On Christmas Day he arrives at the orphanage where he was raised to enact revenge on Mother Superior, but is stopped by police who shoot him to death. The character was largely received by critics as offensive due to the violent acts he commits on Christmas, and the film was widely protested upon its theatrical release in 1984. Appearances Films In Silent Night, Deadly Night, Billy first appears at age five in 1971, driving with his parents and infant brother, Ricky, to visit his grandfather in a psychiatric care facility on Christmas Eve. On their way home, his parents stop on a desolate country road where a man in a Santa Claus suit has experienced a car breakdown. The man murders Billy's parents in front of him and beats his mother; Billy manages to hide in a ditch, and the killer flees the scene. Billy and Ricky are placed in an orphanage run by the abusive and strict Mother Superior. Shunned by his peers, Billy finds companionship in the sympathetic Sister Margaret. At age eight, Billy witnesses two of the teenagers in the orphanage having sex; they are caught by Mother Superior, who punishes them severely. In 1984 at age eighteen, Billy leaves the orphanage and acquires a job at Ira's Toy Store. As the Christmas season arrives, however, Billy is troubled by hallucinations and posttraumatic stress related to his parents' murders. At the store's Christmas Eve party, while wearing a Santa Claus suit, he witnesses a male employee attempting to harass a female employee in the stock room; Billy snaps, and murders them both, then kills his boss and other coworker. Billy then embarks on a killing spree. He stumbles upon a suburban house where a couple, Denise and Tommy, are having sex. He impales Denise on a pair of antlers on a taxidermy deer head, and throws Tommy through a window to the ground below, killing him. The commotion awakens Denise's little sister, who sees Billy, dressed as Santa, in the living room. He asks if she's been naughty or nice, and then gives her a utility knife he had used in a murder. After this, Billy follows two teenagers into the woods where they are sledding, and kills one of them with an axe as they sled down a hillside and the other screams in terror. The next morning, Christmas Day, Billy arrives at the orphanage to kill Mother Superior and reunite with his brother Ricky; however, with the help of Sister Margaret, the police have already determined his arrival there, and lay in wait. He enters the orphanage, where the children are unwrapping Christmas gifts; Mother Superior has been confined to wheelchair. He attempts to kill her, but is shot to death in front of the children, one of whom is his younger brother, Ricky; Ricky looks at the Mother Superior, and utters the word \\"naughty\\". In Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2, Billy appears in flashback via footage from Silent Night, Deadly Night as Ricky recounts he and his brother's troubled lives. Merchandise In 2017 NECA and Scream Factory released a special edition Silent Night, Deadly Night Blu-ray package, which included a Billy Chapman action figure that was exclusive to that particular offering. The 8 inch figure is dressed in a fabric Santa suit with removable sculpted hat and features the authorized likeness of actor Robert Brian Wilson, is fully poseable and comes with an axe and hammer accessories.https://bloody-disgusting.com/toys/3500329/christmas-comes-early- necas-silent-night-deadly-night-figure-gets-standalone-release/ Reception In his review of Silent Night, Deadly Night, film critic Leonard Maltin admonished the character of Billy, writing: \\"what's next‚Äîthe Easter Bunny as a child killer?\\" Further backlash from the public over the \\"killer Santa\\" character fueled the film's publicity campaign, but did not lead to generally favorable reception. Chris E. Hayner of GameSpot ranked the character among the best horror film monsters ever and stated that the character was underrated among film viewers. He also expressed that it is Chapmans character which makes the original film enjoyable.https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-12-best-slasher-movie-monsters- ever-ranked/2900-2351/ Chad Byrnes of LA Weekly ranked the character at number seven of the greatest slasher killers in films.

In 1925, Cornish moved to Carnarvon to become the licensee of the Gascoyne Hotel. He was elected to the Carnarvon Municipal Council the same year, and served as a councillor until 1935 (including as mayor from 1929 to 1932). Cornish entered parliament in June 1942, winning a Legislative Council by-election caused by the death of Joseph Holmes. He stood for re-election in 1946, but was defeated by Mervyn Forrest of the Liberal Party. Cornish lived in Perth after leaving parliament, where he was the licensee of two hotels. He died in October 1961, aged 70, while visiting England. Cornish had married Marjorie Richardson in 1927, with whom he had five children. A nephew, Dick Old, was also a member of parliament.

It is exempt, i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See and its Roman Congregation for the Oriental Churches.  History  The Greek Catholic Churches were present in the Austrian Empire since November 21, 1611 when the Serbian Orthodox Bishop Simeon Vratanja of Marƒça traveled to Rome and formally accepted the jurisdiction of the pope over his bishopric, which eventually became the Eparchy of Kri≈æevci in 1777. As a result of the incorporation of Ukrainian territories into the Empire, in 1783 the first Ukrainian Greek-Catholic parish (called then Ruthenian) of St. Barbara in Vienna (Barbarakirche), approved by Emperor Joseph II of Austria, was founded. With the Republic of Austria, the 1933 Holy See's Concordat was the legal basis.ris.bka.gv.at In the course of the Cold War, when the Eastern Churches were in distress, in 1956 the Ordinariat was established as a diocese of the Austrian faithful. It is exempt, directly subordinate to the Holy See, and is personally headed by the Archbishop of Vienna. Until the 1980s, several other missions were created next to St. Barbara. On December 12, 1935 a decree of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches decided that the parish of Santa Barbara in Vienna was transferred from the archieparchy of Lviv to the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Vienna in a personal capacity as apostolic delegate (delegatus tamquam Sanctae Sedis specialiter), meaning that it was not included in the archdiocese of Vienna. The same decree arranged that all the Byzantine Catholic faithful of Austria should pass into the personal jurisdiction of the archbishop: In erga fideles rite commorantes Byzantini fines intra Reipublicae Austriacae. Another decree of October 3, 1945, decided to extend the jurisdiction of the archbishop (facultates omnes) and on November 1, 1945 he was appointed vicar general of the Byzantine Catholics in Austria.Geschichte des byzantinischen Ordinariats in √ñsterreich The ordinariate was established on 13 June 1956, on territory previously only served pastorally by the Latin church. It is vested in the Archbishop of Vienna, once capital of the Habsburg Monarchy, which included many of the present Eastern (European) 'Greek' Catholic communities.  Territory and statistics  The diocese extends to all the faithful who live in Austria and belong to the Byzantine rite. Its episcopal see is the St. Barbara church, in Vienna (Wien), capital of Austria. There are larger Ukrainian and Romanian communities and smaller Melkite, Byzantine groups of Italo-Albanians, Ruthenians, Greeks, Bulgarians, Slovaks and Hungarians. The ordinary is regularly the archbishop of Vienna, who entrusts his administration to a vicar general protosyncellus based in Vienna, who since 2014 is Yurij Kolasa. The Romanian Mission (Misiunii Romane Unite din Vienna) has a rector, Vasile Lutai. As per 2016, it pastorally served 10,000 Catholics in 1 parish and 8 missions.  Parish and chapels  = Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church = The Ukrainian Greek Catholic central parish is in the church of Santa Barbara in Vienna,st-barbara-austria.org which is the only parish of the Ordinariate (central parish), together with three other Byzantine chapels in Lower Austria. Except in Vienna are currently Ukrainian Greek Catholic chapels in Salzburg (St. Mark's Church) Innsbruck (auxiliary funeral parish at the international seminary Collegium Canisianum)ukrainische-kirche-innsbruck.at Graz (Mary Help of Christians Church) and Linz (Carmelite Church).Ukrainische griechisch-katholische Kirche besteht in West√∂sterreich The first congregation in present-day Austria was founded in Vienna in 1783, when Galicia and Lodomeria became part of the Habsburg monarchy during the Polish partition and Ukrainians, also called Ruthenians increasingly came to the capital of the empire. As early as 1773, Maria Theresa had handed over the repealed Viennese Jesuit convent as barbarous to the Greek Catholic. After the end of the Second World War, the number of Ukrainian Greek Catholic faithful in Austria increased again significantly. The newcomers mostly migrated to North America and Australia. In the 1990s, Ukrainian Catholic war refugees from Bosnia Herzegovina, mostly from the Republika Srpska, fled to Austria, and more emigrations from Ukraine and Poland took place, which in turn increased the number of believers. =Romanian Greek Catholic Church = The Romanian Greek Catholic mission is based in the Saint Roch Chapel in Vienna also using the church of St. George in Kagran. Other communities exist in Graz, Linz, Murau and Wiener Neustadt.Misiunea Rom√¢nƒÉ UnitƒÉ, Greco-CatolicƒÉ There was also a community in Salzburg, which was dissolved in the 1950s. = Melkite Greek Catholic Church = The Melkite Greek Catholic community is based at Saint Jacob in Vienna. = German-speaking Catholic Byzantine communities = There are also German-speaking Catholic Byzantine communities that meet in the church of Santa Barbara in Vienna (where there is a Hungarian Byzantine priest and another Ruthenian) and in Salzburg.Byzantinisches Ordinariat in √ñsterreich In the decade of 1950 a small Russian Byzantine Catholic community existed in Salzburg, but it disappeared after the death of its priest.

A graduate of University College, Nottingham, he began working at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich in 1936. In 1939, he was transferred to the rocket department. After the defeat of Germany, he was sent to the United States as part of the British Scientific Mission to work on the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket. On returning to the United Kingdom in 1947, he was recruited by William Penney for the British atomic bomb project. He led the team that developed the firing circuits for the bomb used in Operation Hurricane, the first British nuclear test. He later developed a neutron generator. He took part in most of the British nuclear tests at Maralinga, and was the scientific director of the Operation Grapple tests in 1957. He subsequently became the AWRE's Assistant Director in 1965, Deputy Director in 1972, and Director from 1976 until his retirement in 1978.  Biography  Wallace John Challens was born in Peterborough, Northamptonshire, on 14 May 1915, the son of an engineer. He was educated at Deacon's School in Dogsthorpe, Peterborough, and University College, Nottingham. On graduating in 1936, the War Office offered him a ¬£225 per annum job in the ballistics department at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, working on the ballistics of heavy guns. Good jobs were hard to come by during the Great Depression, and Challens wanted to marry and start a family. He married Joan Stephenson in 1938. They had two sons. In 1939, he was transferred to the rocket department. During the Second World War, this moved from Woolwich to Fort Halstead, and then to Aberporth in 1940, where it became the Projectile Development Establishment, with Sir Alwyn Crow as Controller of Projectile Development and William Cook as his deputy. On 17 April 1945, he was commissioned into the British Army as a second lieutenant on the General List. After the defeat of Germany, he was sent to Germany, and then to the United States as part of the British Scientific Mission to work on the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket. For his services, he was awarded the U.S. Medal of Freedom. On returning to the United Kingdom in 1947, he was approached by William Penney to join the British atomic bomb project, then known as High Explosive Research (HER), at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE). There was a tussle between the rocket and atomic bomb projects over who would have Challens' services, and Penney won only after appealing to the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Supply, Sir Archibald Rowlands. Challens was placed in charge of the group responsible for the firing circuits that would detonate the 32 pentagonal- and hexagonal-shaped explosive lenses of the implosion-type nuclear weapon, based on the American Fat Man design which Penney had worked on at the Los Alamos Laboratory as part of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project. All 32 lenses had to detonate within a few millionths of a second of each other, something well beyond the state of the art of British electronics in 1947. The firing circuits had to be safe, reliable, and durable enough to withstand buffeting in an aircraft. Models were tested in the laboratory in 1950, but the first production versions did not become available until 1951. A problem was then discovered, which was not resolved until 1952. At first it seemed that the fix could not be incorporated in time for Operation Hurricane, the first British nuclear test, which was then only two months away, but in the end a solution was found. Challens flew out to the Montebello Islands for the test with his colleague Eddie Howse, and they were the last ones to touch the bomb, which was installed on board , before it was detonated. Challens took part in most of the British nuclear tests at Maralinga, and he was the scientific director of the Operation Grapple tests at Malden Island and Christmas Island in 1957, when the first British hydrogen bombs were tested. He designed the firing circuits for these bombs, and also developed a neutron generator. He was part of the British delegation that met with the Americans to discuss nuclear weapons design cooperation under the 1958 US‚ÄìUK Mutual Defence Agreement, and the Americans were greatly impressed with his neutron generator, which was a more advanced design than theirs. In 1959, he became the AWRE's head of Warhead Development, developing missile warheads for the RAF, and then for the Royal Navy's Polaris submarines. He subsequently became the AWRE's Assistant Director in 1965, Deputy Director in 1972, and was its Director from 1976 until his retirement in 1978. His last major project was Chevaline, the effort to prolong the lifetime of the Polaris nuclear missile. For his services, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1958 New Year Honours, and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1968 New Year Honours. His wife Joan died in 1971. In 1973, he married Norma Lane, who shared his passion for golf. He was captain and president of Basingstoke Golf Club, and became a life member. He died suddenly on the Basingstoke golf course on 1 March 2002.

MPEG LA News Release, 20.01.2016  Technology  EVS employs similar concepts to its predecessors, such as AMR-WB, to which it retains backward-compatibility. It switches between speech and audio compression modes depending on the content, using ACELP and MDCT. The following features are present in EVS: * source-controlled variable bit-rate (SC-VBR) * voice/sound activity detector (VAD) * comfort noise generation (CNG) * error concealment (EC) for packet loss in networks * channel-aware mode to improve frame/packet error resilience * jitter buffer management (JBM) Input sampling rates for EVS can be 8, 16, 32, and 48 kHz. It supports the following bitrates (in kbps) for different bandwidths: * Narrowband (NB): 5.9, 7.2, 8, 9.6, 13.2, 16.4, 24.4 * Wideband (WB): 5.9, 7.2, 8, 9.6, 13.2, 13.2 channel-aware, 16.4, 24.4, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128 (6.6 ~ 23.85 for AMR-WB IO) * Super-wideband (SWB): 9.6, 13.2, 13.2 channel-aware, 16.4, 24.4, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128 * Fullband (FB): 16.4, 24.4, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128 Bitrates can be switched every 20 ms.

Created by Brian Yuzna, Arthur Gorson, and S.J. Smith, she is an editor for the fictional classified ads paper the L.A. Eye. She is first introduced in the fourth installment in the series, Silent Night, Deadly Night 4: Initiation (1990), as the protagonist of the film who finds herself enmeshed with a cult of witches while investigating the mysterious spontaneous combustion death of a woman. She is later featured in Silent Night, Deadly Night 5: The Toy Maker in a cameo appearance as a friend of the protagonist, Derek's, mother. Appearances Kim first appears in Silent Night, Deadly Night 4: Initiation, working in Los Angeles, California as an editor and aspiring journalist for the L.A. Eye. When she hears of a potential spontaneous combustion death of a woman who leapt from a building rooftop, she begins her own investigative work in spite of her boss Eli's demands. She meets Fima, a book store proprietor in the building where the victim leapt from; Fima gives her a book as a gift, which tells of feminine occultism and worship of Lilith. Meanwhile, Kim begins to notice her apartment has become infested with cockroaches. After spending Christmas Eve with her boyfriend Hank's antisemitic family, Kim returns home and continues to read the book; she inexplicably becomes violently ill and blacks out, missing an entire day of work. She later attends a picnic of Fima's, where she meets a series of women who are part of an apparent cult. While at Fima's apartment, Kim is drugged and awakens to Fima, the women, and a male transient, Ricky, performing a ritual on her: They paint her body, and insert a giant larvae- like creature inside her vagina, which she then vomits out of her mouth. The larvae is cut in half, and its entrails are poured over her head. She awakens in Fima's apartment, fully dressed, and returns home, terrified. At her apartment, she is comforted by Hank, but Ricky breaks into the apartment and kills Hank with a butcher knife. Kim's co-worker, Janice, arrives at the apartment, and is revealed to be a cult member herself. Ricky takes Kim to a local Chinese meat market next-door to Fima's bookstore, and locks her in the meat cooler there. Inside, Kim experiences bizarre hallucinations and witnesses her hands contorting together, and her legs twisting into a spiral. She loses consciousness again, and awakens to Ricky raping her as the entire cult watches. After the ordeal, Kim returns home and calls a police detective to her apartment, but they find no trace of Hank's body. When confronted by Ricky, Kim agrees to acquiesce to the cult's wishes, which entail an initiation ritual in which a human sacrifice must take place; they ask her to kidnap Hank's younger brother, Lonnie, to be sacrificed. Kim and Ricky arrive at Hank's parents' house, where Ricky kills Hank's mother and strangles his father to death with Christmas lights before setting the house on fire. They bring the teenaged Lonnie to the rooftop above Fima's store, where the cult has gathered, but instead of stabbing Lonnie, Kim attacks Fima, stabbing the knife into her stomach. Kim's hands again begin to contort and fuse together, and she uses them to impale Fima's wound in her stomach, killing her; Fima then lights on fire, and leaps from the building's rooftop to her death. The cult flees, and Kim and Lonnie escape to safety. In Silent Night, Deadly Night 5: The Toy Maker, Kim appears as the friend of Sarah, the child protagonist's mother. Kim visits Sarah at her home, bringing Lonnie with her, who she has now adopted. Lonnie is hospitalized after using a pair of roller skates given to him as a gift that contain rockets in them, causing him to lose control. Reception Contemporary critics have read the character of Kim as comparable to that of the titular character in Rosemary's Baby (1968). Treated unequally in her workplace by her male co-workers (particularly her chauvinist boss, Eli), she has been read as a feminist character; yet she triumphs over evil by refusing to commit the sacrifice of a male (Lonnie) as an initiation into the witches' cult.

The film featured acting debuts of Mikhail Gluzsky and Anatoly Solovyov. Plot In search of truth and the possibility of punishing the director-bureaucrat Meshkov, who collapsed the once prosperous work in the Far East animal-breeding sovkhoz, the best farm worker Katya Ivanova goes to the district center. On the way to the station Katya manages to catch and pass over a saboteur to the border guards. Then she rides the train without a ticket to write a complaint, which means that she has to work as a waitress in the dining car, and gets into Moscow. On the train, Katya meets a sailor Sergei, but upon arrival in Moscow they lose each other. Katya gets employed as a saleswoman in a fur shop and after that at a factory of gramophone records. At the same time she actively convinces female colleagues at work go to the Far East. For a long time Sergei is looking for Katya and finally his search is a success. Meanwhile Katya's complaint is examined, and she is appointed as the new director of the farm, instead of the dismissed Meshkov. Katya and her friend Sergei go to the Far East.

The four non-European cardinals had not participated in the conclave that elected him in February. Three of them arrived too late and one did not attempt the journey. With Cum proxime, Pius XI extended the time between the death of a pope and the start of the conclave to increase the likelihood that cardinals from distant locations could reach Rome in time to participate. Like other documents issued on the pope's own authority, that is, a motu proprio, it is known by the opening words of its original Latin text. Pius begins by saying that he has been considering the conclave that elected him, and his opening words \\"Cum proxime\\" mean roughly since the recent. Background Traveling to attend at a conclave had long posed a challenge to cardinals outside of Italy. On occasion the cardinals based in or near Rome entered a conclave hoping to elect a pope before all their colleagues joined them. Wartime constraints allowed only 34 of 45 cardinals to attend the conclave of 1799-1800 in Venice. Despite dramatic improvements in transportation in the 19th century, the appointment of cardinals outside Europe presented a new challenge. In 1878 Cardinal John McCloskey arrived from New York five days after the start of the conclave, three days after it concluded. In 1903 Cardinal James Gibbons of Baltimore was able to attend only because the death of Pope Leo XIII was long anticipated. That same year Cardinal Patrick Francis Moran of Sydney left Australia on 9 July and was not expected to reach Rome until August 20. In 1914, when the conclave began on 31 August, Cardinals Gibbons of Baltimore and William O'Connell of Boston were not expected to arrive in Rome before 1 November and Cardinal Louis-Nazaire B√©gin of Quebec even later. In 1922, Cardinal Joaquim Arcoverde de Albuquerque Cavalcanti of Rio de Janeiro knew he could not reach Rome in time for the conclave and did not attempt the journey. The other three non-European cardinals‚Äìagain O'Connell and B√©gin as in 1914, as well as Denis Dougherty of Philadelphia‚Äìdid not arrive in time to participate in the conclave. O'Connell arrived at the Vatican on 6 February \\"at the moment the new Pope was blessing the multitude\\". Cardinals Dougherty and B√©gin never expected to arrive in time, learned the outcome of the conclave while still at sea, and reached Rome on 9 February. In 1922, the College of Cardinals debated whether to start the conclave as required after allowing ten days to elapse after the death of Benedict XV. Two-thirds of the non-Italian cardinals and some of the Italians wanted to delay the start until at least one of the Americans arrived. Cardinal J√°nos Csernoch of Hungary told the other cardinals that \\"America is a vital part of the Church. It will be calamitous to deny her participation in the election of the Pontiff. It will have a grave reaction among the American people; it will wound their pride and dignity.\\" Cardinal Friedrich Gustav Piffl opposed proceeding without the Americans \\"for the sake of a technicality\\".  Cum proxime  Immediately following the conclave, the dispute about delaying the conclave to await the arrival of the Americans continued. On 8 February, four French cardinals, Louis Lu√ßon of Rheims, Louis-Ernest Dubois of Paris, Pierre Andrieu of Bordeaux, and Louis-Joseph Maurin of Lyon, asked for changes to church law to allow for an indefinite delay to ensure participation by cardinals from North and South America. And Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, who had led the Italians in opposition to a delay, expressed support for some modification of the schedule. On 28 February Pope Pius met with Cardinal O'Connell and said: \\"There will be no more racing 5,000 miles in a vain endeavor to reach Rome in time for a Conclave. The United States is too important to be ignored as she has been. I shall see to it that what happened at the last Conclave shall not occur again.\\" Pius XI issued new regulations in Cum proxime on 1 March 1922. He noted the experience of the conclave that elected him and that cardinals had requested modifications. In place of a fixed interval of ten days following the day the papacy becomes vacant, he set the start of the conclave at ten to fifteen days from the death of the pope and allowed the College of Cardinals, meeting in general congregation, to extend that to as long as eighteen days. Later experience When the next papal conclave took place in 1939, the College of Cardinals waited the maximum eighteen days and all 62 cardinals attended, including six from the Western Hemisphere. By the next conclave in 1958, the speed of travel matched the internationalization of the College. As one newspaper put it, \\"the Archbishop of New York can reach Rome today faster than the Archbishop of Palermo did a generation ago\\". Nevertheless, in 1975 Pope Paul VI allowed the College to extend the interval to as long as twenty days.

It has a single hairy leaf and up to three red, yellow and green flowers. It is a variable species, similar to the king spider orchid (C. pectinata) and sometimes hybridises with other species so that it can be difficult to recognise, but is one of the largest spider orchids found in Western Australia.Caladenia decora labellum detail Description Caladenia decora is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which grows as a solitary plant or in small clumps. It has a single, erect, linear, hairy leaf, long and wide. The leaf is pale green and has purple-red blotches near its base. Up to three red, yellow and green flowers are borne on a stalk tall. The flowers are long and wide, making them one of the largest among Western Australian spider orchids. The bases of the sepals and petals are linear to lance-shaped and held stiffly for about one-third, then suddenly narrow. The dorsal sepal is erect, linear to lance-shaped, long and wide at the base with a yellow-brown glandular tip up to long. The lateral sepals are spreading and downcurved, long and wide at the base with a tip similar to the one on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long and wide at the base, slightly ascending then slightly curved downwards and sometime lack glandular tips. The labellum is dark pink with red stripes and ends in a dark tip. It is linear to heart-shaped, long and wide and curves downward at the front. The sides curve upwards and have a fringe of narrow teeth up to long but suddenly decreasing in length about half-way towards the tip of the labellum. There are four rows of pale maroon, golf stick-shaped calli in the centre of the labellum for at least three-quarters of its length, but decreasing in size towards its tip. Flowering occurs from mid-August to October. This species is similar to the similarly-sized Caladenia pectinata but is more brightly coloured, often has gland-tipped petals and has a more easterly distribution. Hybrids with Caladenia longicauda subsp. crassa are common. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia decora was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2001 from a specimen collected by Hopper near the Jerdacuttup River north-east of Hopetoun. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (decora) is a Latin word meaning \\"fitting\\", \\"proper\\" or \\"beautiful\\". Distribution and habitat The Esperance king spider orchid is found near the coast between Bremer Bay and Cape Arid in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions where it usually grows in shrubland and woodlands in winter-wet areas but sometimes also near granite outcrops. Conservation Caladenia decora is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

H√©roux was born in Pointe-du-LacCanada East Census 1851 (Recensement - Canada Est, district de recensement No 2) in Lower Canada and baptized in nearby Trois-Rivi√®res.Parish Registers, Immacul√©e- Conception, Trois-Rivi√®res, Qu√©bec. The claim that he was Iroquois is contradicted by the documentary evidence. At the age of 20, he was caught trespassing at a building on a wharf. His original punishment was commuted on the condition he seek employment outside Lower Canada. He was hired by the Hudson's Bay Company in the spring of 1833 and sent to several interior posts. In 1837 he was reappointed to Fort Vancouver, where he met and had at least one child with a Chinookan woman. From here he would serve intermittently at Fort Vancouver, Fort Taku, and finally Fort Stikine, arriving at the final station in 1841. Fort Stikine was located within the Stikine lisi√®re, a territory of Russian America leased to the HBC by the Russian-American Company. Among his other duties he may have served as interpreter. During his time at Fort Stikine, he was caught stealing alcohol by William Glen Rae and later became embroiled in disputes with John McLoughlin, Jr. These poor relations erupted into a confrontation that ended with John Jr.'s death on 21 April 1842. George Simpson, on a general inspection of the Columbia Department, arrived five days after the killing. After a short investigation he considered H√©roux justified, and sent him to Novoarkhangelsk rather than be tried in a court in the Province of Canada or the United Kingdom. Several other men later testified that John Jr. was prone to alcoholism and apparently had tried to kill H√©roux. H√©roux was released in 1843 by Chief Manager of Russian America Arvid Adolf Ethol√©n due to Russian disinterest in the case. He was transported by the Cadboro and later the Beaver to Fort Victoria and Fort Vancouver. From there he went over the York Factory Express to Norway House. In 1846, legal authorities in Canada concluded that the expense to ship H√©roux and all witnesses to the United Kingdom would be too exorbitant and instead closed the case. Simpson's official disinterest in the matter aroused great hostility in his subordinate, Chief Factor John McLoughlin, the father of the victim, and contributed to his eventual retirement from the company. H√©roux returned to Trois-Rivi√®res and died there in 1853.

Trump and his supporters have falsely claimed that U.S. intelligence community probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election were launched due to Steele's dossier. The House Intelligence Committee, then in Republican control, concluded in an April 2018 report that the probe had been triggered based on information on Trump adviser George Papadopoulos and the February 2018 Nunes memo written by staff members for that committee reached the same conclusion.  Early life  Christopher David Steele was born in the Yemeni city of Aden (then part of the British-controlled Federation of South Arabia), on 24 June 1964. His parents, Perris and Janet, met while working at the Met Office, the United Kingdom's national weather service. His paternal grandfather was a coal miner from Pontypridd in Wales. Steele spent time growing up in Aden, the Shetland Islands, and Cyprus, as well as at Wellington College, Berkshire. Steele matriculated at Girton College, Cambridge in 1982. While at the University of Cambridge, he wrote for the student newspaper, Varsity. In the Easter term of 1986, Steele was President of the Cambridge Union debating society. He graduated with a degree in Social and Political Sciences in 1986.The Cambridge University List of Members  Career  Steele was recruited by MI6 directly following his graduation from Cambridge and worked for MI6 for 22 years. He worked in London at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) from 1987 to 1989. From 1990 to 1993, Steele worked under diplomatic cover as an MI6 officer in Moscow, serving at the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Moscow. Steele was an \\"internal traveller\\", visiting newly-accessible cities such as Samara and Kazan. He returned to London in 1993, working again at the FCO until his posting with the British Embassy in Paris in 1998, where he served under diplomatic cover until 2002. The identity of Steele's as an MI6 officer and those of a hundred and sixteen other British spies were revealed in an anonymously published list that Her Majesty's Government attempted to suppress through a DSMA-Notice in 1999. In 2003, Steele was sent to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan as part of an MI6 team, briefing Special Forces on \\"kill or capture\\" missions for Taliban targets, and also spent time teaching new MI6 recruits. Steele returned to London and between 2006 and 2009 he headed the Russia Desk at MI6. Steele's expertise on Russia remained valued, and he served as a senior officer under John Scarlett, Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), from 2004 to 2009. Steele was a counterintelligence specialist and was selected as case officer for Alexander Litvinenko and participated in the investigation of the Litvinenko poisoning in 2006. It was Steele who quickly realised that Litvinenko's death \\"was a Russian state 'hit. Twelve years later Boris Karpichkov alleged that Steele himself was included in a hit list of the Russian Federal Security Service, along with Sergei Skripal who was poisoned in 2018 by a binary chemical weapon Novichok in Britain. Since 2009 Steele has not been to Russia, or visited any former Soviet states and in 2012, an Orbis informant quoted an FSB-agent describing him as an \\"enemy of Mother Russia\\". Steele has refrained from travelling to the United States since his identity became public, citing the political and legal situation. In 2012, Orbis was sub-contracted by a law firm representing Oleg Deripaska, who was also a \\"person of interest\\" to the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia‚Äôs election interference. Between 2014 and 2016, together with Bruce Ohr, Steele cooperated with the FBI's and Justice Department's unsuccessful efforts to flip Deripaska into an informant.  Private sector  In March 2009, Steele and fellow MI6-retiree Chris Burrows co-founded the private intelligence agency Orbis Business Intelligence, Ltd., based in Grosvenor Square Gardens. Between 2014 and 2016, Steele created over 100 reports on Russian and Ukrainian issues, which were read within the United States Department of State, and he was viewed as credible by the United States intelligence community. The business was commercially successful, grossing approximately $20,000,000 in the first nine years of operation. Steele ran an investigation dubbed \\"Project Charlemagne\\", which noted Russian interference in the domestic politics of France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. In April 2016, Steele concluded that Russia was engaged in an information warfare campaign with the goal of destroying the European Union. In 2017, Steele established a new company called Chawton Holdings, again with Christopher Burrows. In November 2018, Steele sued the German industrial group Bilfinger, alleging that the company owed ‚Ç¨150,000 for an investigation into Bilfinger's activities in Nigeria and Sakhalin.  FIFA research  In 2010, The Football Association (FA), England's domestic football governing body, organised a committee in the hope of hosting the 2018 or 2022 World Cups. The FA hired Steele's company to investigate FIFA (International Federation of Association Football). In advance of the FBI launching its 2015 FIFA corruption case, members of the FBI's Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force met with Steele in London to discuss allegations of possible corruption in FIFA. Steele's research indicated that Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin had rigged the bidding of the 2018 World Cups by employing bribery.  Attempts by China to capture UK elite  Steele also contributed to a privately commissioned report that alleged China attempted to influence key figures in British politics and business. The report was submitted to selected British MPs and some media.  Steele dossier   Background and information gathering  In September 2015, the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, retained the services of Fusion GPS, a private Washington D.C. political research firm, to conduct research on several primary Republican Party candidates including Trump. The research was not primarily related to Russia and was ended once Trump was determined to be the presidential nominee. The firm was subsequently hired by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through their shared attorney at Perkins Coie, Marc Elias. Fusion GPS then hired Steele to investigate Trump's Russia-related activities, and this investigation produced what became known as the Steele dossier. In July 2016, Steele supplied a report he had written to an FBI agent in Rome. His contact at the FBI was the same senior agent with whom he had worked when investigating the FIFA scandal. In September 2016, Steele held a series of off the record meetings with journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, Yahoo! News, The New Yorker and CNN. In October 2016, Steele spoke about his discoveries to David Corn of the progressive American political magazine Mother Jones. Steele said he decided to pass his dossier to both British and American intelligence officials after concluding that the material should not just be in the hands of political opponents of Trump, but was a matter of national security for both countries. Corn's resulting 31 October article in Mother Jones was the first to publicly mention information which became part of the dossier, although the article did not disclose Steele's identity. The magazine did not publish the dossier itself, however, or detail its allegations, since they could not be verified.  Whistleblower  Steele's reaction to the revelations from his sources has been described as that of a whistleblower. Steele has stated that he soon found \\"troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government\\". According to his sources, \\"there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit\\". According to Harding, \\"Steele was shocked by the extent of collusion his sources were reporting\\", and told his friends: \\"For anyone who reads it, this is a life-changing experience.\\" Steele felt that what he had unearthed \\"was something of huge significance, way above party politics\\". American reporter Howard Blum described Steele's rationale for becoming a whistleblower: \\"The greater good trumps all other concerns.\\" On his own initiative, Steele decided to also pass the information to British and American intelligence services because he believed the findings were a matter of national security for both countries. According to Simpson's testimony, Steele, who enjoyed a good working reputation \\"for the knowledge he had developed over nearly 20 years working on Russia-related issues for British intelligence, approached the FBI because he was concerned that Trump, then a candidate, was being blackmailed by Russia, and he became \\"very concerned about whether this represented a national security threat\\". In relation to a defamation lawsuit filed by Aleksej Gubarev against BuzzFeed, regarding their publication of the dossier, Senior Master Barbara Fontaine said Steele was \\"in many respects in the same position as a whistle-blower\\" because of his actions \\"in sending part of the dossier to Senator John McCain and a senior government national security official, and in briefing sections of the US media\\".  Post-election work on the dossier  Steele continued to work for Fusion GPS on the dossier without a client to pay him. After the election, Steele's dossier \\"became one of Washington's worst- kept secrets, and journalists worked to verify the allegations\\". On 18 November 2016, Sir Andrew Wood, British ambassador to Moscow from 1995 to 2000, met with U.S. Senator John McCain at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada, and told McCain about the existence of the dossier about Trump. Wood vouched for Steele's professionalism and integrity. In early December, McCain obtained a copy of the dossier from David J. Kramer, a former U.S. State Department official working at Arizona State University. On 9 December 2016, McCain met with FBI Director James Comey to pass on the information. In a second memo Steele wrote in November 2016, after the termination of his contract with Fusion, he reported that Russian officials had claimed that Russia had blocked Donald Trump from nominating Mitt Romney to be his Secretary of State, due to Romney's hawkishness on Russia.  Revealed identity  On 11 January 2017, The Wall Street Journal revealed that Steele was the author of the dossier about Trump, citing \\"people familiar with the matter\\". Although the dossier's existence had been \\"common knowledge\\" among journalists for months at that point and had become public knowledge during the previous week, Steele's name had not been revealed. The Telegraph asserted that Steele's anonymity had been \\"fatally compromised\\" after CNN published his nationality. The Independent reported that Steele left his home in England several hours before his name was published as the author of the dossier, as he was fearful of retaliation by Russian authorities. In contrast, The Washington Post reported that he left after he had been identified earlier in the day by the initial The Wall Street Journal report. Christopher Burrows, director of Orbis Business Intelligence, Ltd., said he would not \\"confirm or deny\\" that Orbis had produced the dossier. The ending of Steele's relationship with the FBI was variously reported as due to either the public revelation of Steele's identity, or Steele's release of information to the press, or Steele's denial to the FBI of having spoken to the press. One source dated this event to late October 2016.Andrew C. McCarthy. Grassley‚ÄìGraham Memo Affirms Nunes Memo‚ÄîMedia Yawns. National Review. 10 February 2018. On 7 March 2017, as some members of the United States Congress were expressing interest in meeting with or hearing testimony from Steele, he reemerged after weeks in hiding, appearing publicly on camera and stating, \\"I'm really pleased to be back here working again at the Orbis's offices in London today\\".  Disclosure and reactions  In early January 2017, a two-page summary of the dossier was presented to President Barack Obama and incoming President Donald Trump in meetings with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers. On 10 January 2017, BuzzFeed was the first media outlet to publish the full 35-page dossier. In publishing the Trump dossier, BuzzFeed said it had been unable to verify or corroborate the allegations. The UK issued a DSMA notice on 10 January 2017, requesting that the media not reveal Steele's identity, although the BBC and other UK news media released the information in news stories the same day. Trump said the dossier's allegations were ‚Äúfake news‚Äù during a press conference. Vladimir Putin also dismissed the claims. Ynet, an Israeli online news site, reported that US intelligence advised Israeli intelligence officers to be cautious about sharing information with the incoming Trump administration, until the possibility of Russian influence over Trump, suggested by Steele's report, has been fully investigated. Former British ambassador to Russia, Sir Tony Brenton, read Steele's report. Speaking on Sky News he said, \\"I've seen quite a lot of intelligence on Russia, and there are some things in it which look pretty shaky\\". Brenton expressed some doubts due to discrepancies in how the dossier described aspects of the hacking activities, as well as Steele's ability to penetrate the Kremlin and Russian security agencies, given that he is an outsider. On 15 March 2017, former Acting CIA Director Michael Morell raised questions about the dossier. He was concerned about the accuracy of the information, due to the approach taken by Steele to gather it. Steele gave money to intermediaries and the intermediaries paid the sources. Morell said, \\"Unless you know the sources, and unless you know how a particular source acquired a particular piece of information, you can't judge the information‚Äîyou just can't.\\" Morell continued to believe that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. = Role in the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation = Although the dossier later became one factor among many in the Russia investigation, it had no role in the start of the investigation. This fact has been the subject of intense discussion and controversy, largely fuelled by false claims made by Trump and his supporters. In early February 2018, the Nunes memo, written by aides of Republican U.S. Representative Devin Nunes (who was at the time the Chair of the House Intelligence Committee), said that the information on George Papadopoulos \\"triggered the opening of\\" the original FBI investigation in late July 2016 into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.Multiple sources: # # # # # # # In late February 2018, a rebuttal memo by Democrats in the House Intelligence Committee stated that \\"Christopher Steele's reporting... played no role in launching the counterintelligence investigation... In fact, Steele's reporting did not reach the counterintelligence team investigating Russia at FBI headquarters until mid- September 2016, more than seven weeks after the FBI opened its investigation, because the probe's existence was so closely held within the FBI.\\" In April 2018, the House Intelligence Committee, then under Republican control, released a final report on Russian interference in the 2016 election; the report said the House Intelligence Committee had found that \\"in late July 2016, the FBI opened an enterprise CI [counterintelligence] investigation into the Trump campaign following the receipt of derogatory information about foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos\\". = Role in subsequent investigations = In the summer of 2017, two Republican staffers for the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence travelled to London to investigate the dossier, visiting the office of Steele's lawyer but not meeting with Steele. In August 2018, Representative Devin Nunes, Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, travelled to London in an attempt to meet with the heads of MI5, MI6, and GCHQ for information about Steele, but was rebuffed by the three agencies. Steele reportedly revealed the identities of the sources used in the dossier to the FBI. Investigators from Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation team met with Steele in September 2017 to interview him about the dossier's claims. The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was in contact with lawyers representing Steele. Over the course of two days in June 2019, Steele was interviewed in London by investigators from the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General regarding the Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier. They found his testimony surprising and his \\"information sufficiently credible to have to extend the investigation\\". = Legal action = In February 2017, lawyers for Russian internet entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev filed a libel suit against Steele in London. Gubarev claimed he was defamed by allegations in the dossier. In August 2017, lawyers for Gubarev demanded Steele give a deposition regarding the dossier, as part of a libel lawsuit against BuzzFeed News filed in February. Steele objected to testifying but his objections were rejected by U.S. District Court Judge Ursula Mancusi Ungaro, who allowed the deposition to proceed. In April 2018, Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and German Khan‚Äîthe owners of Russian commercial bank Alfa Bank‚Äîfiled a libel suit in Washington D.C. against Steele, who mentioned the bank in the Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier. The lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Anthony C. Epstein on 20 August 2018. Alfa Bank partners Petr Aven, Mikhail Fridman, and German Khan brought a lawsuit for defamation in Britain against Orbis Business Intelligence, Steele‚Äôs private intelligence firm. In July 2020, Justice Warby from the Queen‚Äôs Bench Division of the British High Court of Justice ordered Steele to pay damages to Aven and Fridman who Steele claimed had delivered \\"large amounts of illicit cash\\" to Vladimir Putin when Putin was deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. Judge Warby stated that the claim was \\"demonstrably false\\" and awarded the damages to compensate \\"for the loss of autonomy, distress and reputational damage caused by the breaches of duty\\". The judge stated that Steele‚Äôs dossier also inaccurately claimed that Aven and Fridman provided foreign policy advice to Putin. = Senate Republicans' referral for a criminal investigation = On 5 January 2018, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, joined by senior Republican member Lindsey Graham, issued a criminal referral regarding Steele to the Justice Department for it to investigate whether Steele had lied to the FBI about his interactions with the media. Because the referral is based on classified FBI documents, the context in which the Republican senators allege Steele to have lied is limited to references that he discussed the dossier with media outlets. Both Grassley and Graham declared that they were not alleging Steele \\"had committed any crime. Rather, they had passed on the information for 'further investigation only'\\". The referral was met with scepticism from legal experts, as well as members of both parties on the Judiciary Committee. Fusion GPS lawyer Joshua A. Levy said the referral was just another effort to discredit the investigation into Russian interference in the election and that: \\"After a year of investigations into Donald Trump's ties to Russia, the only person Republicans seek to accuse of wrongdoing is one who reported on these matters to law enforcement in the first place\\". Veteran prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg called the referral \\"nonsense\\" because \\"the FBI doesn't need any prompting from politicians to prosecute people who have lied to them.\\" Another former federal prosecutor, Justin Dillon, said that \\"it was too early to assume the letter was simply a political attack\\". The senior Democrat on the Committee, Dianne Feinstein, said that the referral was made without consultation of any Democrats on the committee and released a five-page rebuttal. A Republican aide said Grassley and Graham were \\"carrying water for the White House\\"; that their actions did not reflect the views of the committee as a whole; and that other members were upset with Grassley over the matter. In an opinion-editorial for Politico, former CIA official John Sipher said the attacks on Steele, a private citizen who provided information to the FBI that alarmed him, will make future tipsters less likely to approach American law enforcement with information that bears on national security. = U.S. Inspector General findings = On 9 December 2019, U.S. Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified to the House Judiciary Committee that despite making 17 mistakes in their applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA), the FBI showed no political bias during the investigation of Trump and the Russian government. A redacted version of his report was released the same day. Steele was a paid confidential human source for the FBI before preparing the Steele dossier, and the FBI found \\"Steele's information to be valuable and that it warranted compensation\\", with Steele receiving $95,000 from the FBI between 2014 and 2016 for information on previous matters unrelated to Trump. From information in the report, ABC News determined that Steele and Ivanka Trump had had a business and personal relationship from 2007 for a number of years. One of the report's findings related to conflicting accounts of sourced content in the dossier. When one of Steele's sources was later interviewed by the FBI about the allegations sourced to them, they gave accounts which conflicted with Steele's renderings in the dossier. They indicated that Steele \\"misstated or exaggerated\\" the source's statements. The IG found it difficult to discern the causes for the discrepancies between some dossier allegations and explanations later provided to the FBI by the sources of those allegations. The IG attributed the discrepancies to three possible factors: miscommunication between Steele and the sources, \\"exaggerations or misrepresentations\\" by Steele, or misrepresentations by the sources when questioned by the FBI. Another factor was described by the Supervisory Intel Analyst, who believed that someone described as \\"one of the key sources\\" for the dossier \\"may have been attempting to minimise his/her role in the election reporting following its release to the public.\\" That person had been the source for \\"the alleged meeting between Carter Page and Igor Divyekin\\" and the \\"allegations concerning Michael Cohen and events in Prague\\".  Personal life  Steele‚Äôs first wife, Laura, with whom he had three children, died in 2009 after a long illness. He remarried in 2012. He and his second wife Katherine had one child and are raising all four children together. He lives in Farnham, Surrey.

Education  Rodgers studied at UCLA (BA 1966, MA 1968, PhD 1970). His teachers included Roy Harris and John Vincent for composition, Robert Nelson for counterpoint, and Robert Stevenson and Nicolas Slonimsky for musicology. He studied orchestration privately with Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  Career  His musical circle included William Albright, Joseph Byrd, Douglas Leedy, Richard Grayson, Paul Reale, and others. Following an appointment at the University of Michigan School of Music, he served as Professor of Music at California State University, Fullerton from 1972 through 2016, where he created and directed the university's electronic music studio for many years. He was a proactive, demanding and often unconventional teacher. His introduction to counterpoint and tuning and temperament lessons often began at the hardware store, gathering materials to construct a monochord, which he referred to as \\"The God Machine,\\" to explore the overtone series and tunings. He was co-founder of the composition and performance collective Cartesian Reunion Memorial Orchestra in which he played saxophone, clarinet, and later, keyboard as well as the CSUF based scratch orchestra or Diverse Instrument Ensemble (D.I.E). He was leader of the Lloyd Rodgers Group, in which he played keyboards.  Works  Major works include a piano Trio (1975) written for the Mirecourt Trio (Premiered in New York City in October 1975), numerous works written for his ensembles, and two ballets for Choreographer Rudy Perez, The Little Prince (1987) and Orpheus (1988). Several of his instrumental works were premiered in California by the Pacific Symphony Orchestra and in Europe by Vienna's Musik Zirkus under his longtime friend and former classmate Keith Clark. He was an energetic producer of concerts and events featuring music of his students and colleagues, as well as his own works, including Message for Garcia (2002), Catastrophe of Meaning (2001), On the Sensations of Tone (2004) and Guns into Mexico (2004). Rodgers's music defies classification. Early on he abandoned academic serialism in favor of music inspired by Medieval mensural notation, Renaissance polyphony and Baroque counterpoint. For a period of time, he began each day with coffee and cigarettes, while composing a strict canon and fugue. His music was generally tonal or modal in character, often utilizing alternative tunings, modular forms, interlocking ostinatos and scores with open or flexible instrumentation. He was one of the earliest composers working in a post-minimal style. Aside from his works published with Material Press, he refused to copyright his music, releasing his works to the Public Domain to be performed without fee, as a part of his advocacy for the unrestricted dissemination of knowledge, with proper attribution.

The remaining Chapel with cemetery lies by an unpopulated cape, that forms the northern mouth of Knebel Vig (Knebel Bay) into √Örhus Bugt(√Örhus Bay) on the southern part of the peninsula Djursland, in Denmark, Northern Europe.Krak.dk As opposed to most other cemeteries in Denmark older graves have not been canceled. For example, one can find graves without stones, but with cast iron crosses, with the burial inscriptions cast into the metal. These crosses are over 150 years old. Another example of old graveyard custom is teacher Chr. Johansens gravesite from 1897. Here a black and white photo of Chr. Johansen is embedded into the gravestone. This is in contrast to the picture-free gravesite norm in Denmark today, even though this is not the case several other places in the world, where photos of the deceased can be a central part of a gravesite. The photographic quality of the photo of Chr. Johansen, taken in the late 1800s might seem surprising, as well as the fact that the seemingly porcelain based picture embedded centrally in the gravestone, apart from damage from a blow, does not show signs of aging, such as fading, even though it has been exposed to the elements for over one hundred years at a desolate cape by the sea .

It consisted of Rols√∏ Church, 8 farms and 6 cottages including the rectory and a windmill.Historian Vilfred Friborg Hansen, Local Heritage Homepage, Rols√∏ Kapel, Friborg.dk This happened in spite of the Danish king Christian den 5.‚Äôs Danish Law, stating that ‚Äù‚Ä¶no village or farm may be demolished to improve the manor farms district‚Ä¶‚Äù This can be read in a folder, available at Rols√∏ Kapel, written by Anne Bytofte in 1999. Here she mentions that the owner of the manor house, Roelsg√•rd, was a good friend of Denmark‚Äôs autocratic king. This is mentioned as a possible reason why the squire succeeded in getting permission to demolish the village. Allegedly against the will of the priest. Other circumstances, such as what the inhabitants of Roelse thought about the matter, is an open question. The manor house, Rols√∏g√•rd, remained, located close to sea between the mouth of Knebel Bay leading into √Örhus Bay. The church was also left untouched, but now with 2.5 kilometers to the closest village, Vrinners, where a, over the years, still bigger part of the congregation lived. The king's permission to tear down the village of Roelse in 1696 was based on the condition that the priest and the congregation should have the possibility of seeking shelter in Roelse, when the church was used for service. Such as if the weather was bad. This could have been in the out-buildings of the manor house. Demolishing In 1907 the congregation, that had begun to use the competing nonconformist believers mission house in Vrinners more and more, succeeded in gaining the financial means as well as the states permission to tear down the church by the cape, on condition that they built a new church in Vrinners. The new church was inaugurated in September 1907, and Rols√∏ Church was torn down the year after. Today a distance of 2.5 kilometers between Vrinners and the church by the cape might not seem as much, but at that time transport was by foot or horse. Not least for elderly people, who sought to go to church every Sunday, as was often the norm in those times, a 5 kilometer walk across the wind exposed hills close to the sea in all kinds of weather, back and forth, could be a long way. Thus, Rols√∏ Church, built around year 1175, existed for about 733 √•r. All that is left after 1908 is the porch converted into a chapel serving the cemetery. The new church in Vrinners from 1908 lies next to the road, Vestre Molsvej. One passes it, when driving through Vrinners to the Mols Hills on southern Djursland. With its red brickwork in modern standard seize bricks, as opposed to older church buildings larger monastic boulders, it deviates from the characteristic look of medieval country churches in Denmark. Baptismal Font Magic When Rols√∏ Church was torn down in 1908 various inventory, including a Roman baptismal font built in the 1100s by the roman master stonecutter, Holter, was transferred to the new church in Vrinners. Holters granite baptismal fonts are often made with a thick chiseled rope circling the basin holding the holy water.Religion.dk, Oversight over Kristne Symboler.dk The purpose of this ornamentation is based on the belief that the graphic magic of the unbroken band of rope prevents evil spirits crossing the rope and entering the holy water in the inner basin gaining access to the little child, according to the priest in Hammelev, Jette Seidelin Christensen. At Hammelev Church, on the northern part of the Djursland peninsula, 5 kilometers north of the town Gren√•, there is also a Holter baptismal font. Hammelev Church is built of limestone, and there is lots of middle age graffiti in the outer walls of the nearly 1000 year old masonry. A lot seems to be scratched out symbols aimed at confusing or entraping evil spirits, by use of symbols based on specialized geometries, such as connected circles, that the spirits supposedly could not get out of, or cross, easily. This is also seen with the unbroken twisted circular band of rope surrounding the Holter baptismal fonts at the Rols√∏- and Hammelev churches. Rope circles like these are also found on other middle age baptismal fonts made by Holter, seen in churches on Djursland, and maybe also in other parts of Denmark. These middle age artifacts were crafted in times when evil spirits and witches were something one believed in literally, and to such a degree, that the superstition gave way to the burning of women alive, if these people became suspected of practicing witchery. Anne Bytofte also describes how Rols√∏ Church was first attempted built at another place, but here what one had built one day, seemed to become spoilt during the night, after which one set two heifers loose and moved the build site to the spot, where the two heifers were found sleeping the next morning. Here the church was left to stand for 733 years, until it was torn down in 1908 by the congregation in Vrinners. Knebel Church Incidentally the torn down Rols√∏ Church was largely identical to the existing Knebel Church, located at the bottom of Knebel Bay a few kilometers from Rols√∏ Chapel. The churches are small white washed and spartan country churches. The nave of the torn down church in Rols√∏ was built from rough granite boulders with a length of approximately 10 meters, and 8 meters wide, while the east facing side annex was about 5 meters long and 6.5 meters wide.

It is the symbol of the Portuguese presidential magistracy, in their capacity as the fount of the Portuguese honours system; therefore, it cannot be conferred on nationals or foreigners, nor can it be used outside the exercise of office of the President. Unlike other decorations, the Sash is not granted to Presidents upon their inauguration, but rather only worn by them during their terms in office. It can be worn with any of the Grand Collars of the orders possessing that grade, but without the sash and wearing the respective order's star that gives precedence to that of the Three Orders Sash.  History  The decoration, along with the similar Sash of the Two Orders, was officially founded in 1789 by Queen Maria I. However, its origins can be traced further back to 1551, when Pope Julius III--under great diplomatic pressure--issued the Praeclara Clarissimi Papal Bull of 30 November, surrendering his position as Grand Master of the three Catholic knightly orders (the Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Order of St. Benedict of Aviz, and the Order of Santiago) to King Jo√£o III of the House of Aviz, who proclaimed it hereditary in the Portuguese Crown. Despite this, the monarchs often wore only the insignia of the Order of Christ. It was during the reign of Maria I that the orders were secularized from religious orders into military orders of merit; the queen further decreed that the insignia of all three orders were to be combined into one, to ensure that no one order was favored above the others. The Sash thus became a unique decoration worn by the monarch, distinguishing them as Grand Master of the Three Military Orders, along with all other Portuguese orders of chivalry. It was also entitled to be worn by the heir to the throne (titled Prince of Brazil, and from 1815 Prince Royal of Portugal) as \\"Grand Commander of the Three Orders\\", and on occasion gifted to the consort of the monarch upon their marriage. Other princes of the blood royal (Infantes) belonging to the House of Braganza, meanwhile, were entitled to wear the Sash of the Two Orders. During the era of the constitutional monarchy, it was customary to confer the Sash on foreign monarchs and heads of state as a diplomatic gesture. In the wake of the revolution of 1910 and the proclamation of the Republic, the Sash was abolished in conjunction with all royal orders (save for the Order of the Tower and Sword). It was later restored in 1918 by decree of President Sid√≥nio Pais, after which it continued to be awarded to foreign heads of state. In 1962, a new decree restricted the Sash of the Three Orders to a decoration exclusive to the President, and thus could no longer be conferred. To date, Queen Elizabeth II is the sole living foreign recipient of the Sash.  Insignia  * The badge of the decoration is an oval in gold filigree, enamelled white on both sides; before 1823, it was made of plain silver or gold with a blank reverse. The medallion depicts within three smaller ovals with the crosses of the three military orders: the order of Christ on top, the order of Aviz on the bottom left, and the order of St. James on the bottom right, each surmounted by a Heart of Jesus decoration. During the era of the monarchy, the badge was surmounted by the royal crown; after 1910 the crown was replaced by a laurel wreath. * The sash of the decoration is constituted of three equal stripes, its colors in the following order: green (Aviz), red (Christ), and violet (St. James); before 1796 the colors were red, green, and red. * The star of the decoration is a gilt circle depicting the crosses of the three orders, superimposed on an eight-pointed star in silver with a gold border. Prior to 1962 the decoration used a silver \\"splendor\\" of 22 or 24 rays. * The rosette of the decoration was first introduced in 2011, and designed to be worn with civilian clothing. It is 12 millimeters in diameter with gold trim, with the same colors as the ribbon.

From 2005 to 2007 Painter was the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration. He is the S. Walter Richey Professor of Corporate Law at the University of Minnesota, and since 2016 has served as vice-chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a government watchdog group. A longtime Republican and self-described centrist, in 2018 Painter ran for the Minnesota Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor Party nomination as an Independent for U.S. Senate, challenging recently appointed Senator Tina Smith.Election filing indicates Painter to run as DFL candidate for U.S. Senate; Minnesota Public Radio; Nina Moini; April 29, 2018 Smith defeated Painter in the primary by a wide margin. Painter has been affiliated with the Campaign Legal Center, a group that is a frequent critic of the Trump administration. Throughout 2017 he was involved in the CREW lawsuit against Trump, CREW v. Trump. Early life and education Painter was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1961. He was raised outside Philadelphia, in Kansas City, Kansas, and in Champaign, Illinois. He graduated from St. George's School, Newport, Rhode Island. Painter received his B.A. in history summa cum laude from Harvard University and his J.D. from Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Journal on Regulation.Richard W. Painter: S. Walter Richey Professor of Corporate Law, University of Minnesota Law School (last accessed November 7, 2018). At Harvard Painter became politically active, speaking out against President Reagan's decision to send aid to the right-wing government in El Salvador and founding the Harvard Radcliffe Democratic Club newspaper Perspective. In 1982 he made his first appearance on national television during an episode of Firing Line with Reagan in which he called out Reagan's \\"reckless deficit spending and cuts to social programs\\". During the 1984 presidential election Painter was the chair of Harvard Students for Walter Mondale. Career Painter served as law clerk to Judge John T. Noonan Jr. of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. He then worked at the law firms of Sullivan & Cromwell in New York and Finn Dixon & Herling in Stamford, Connecticut. Painter was the Guy Raymond and Mildred Van Voorhis Jones Professor of Law at the University of Illinois College of Law from 2002 to 2005 and the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration from 2005 to 2007. Upon leaving the White House, he returned to teaching, at the University of Minnesota Law School.Baker, Peter. \\"Besieged White House Reinforces Counsel's Office\\", Washington Post (June 9, 2007). See correction at top of the article. Painter has been a member of the American Law Institute since 2004. In March 2016 he wrote in The New York Times that if President George W. Bush had had the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice during his last two years in office, with a Democratic-majority Senate, Bush would have chosen Judge Merrick Garland (who was ultimately nominated by President Obama on March 16, 2016) as a consensus nominee.Painter, Richard W. Bush Would Have Nominated Garland, New York Times (March 23, 2016). William K. Kelley, who was deputy counsel to President Bush from 2005 to 2007, disagreed that Bush might have nominated Garland under such circumstances.Whelan, Edward. Re: Baseless Claim that President Bush Would/Might Have Nominated Garland, National Review (March 23, 2016). In December 2016 Painter replaced David Brock as vice-chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). As of May 2017 he is the S. Walter Richey Professor of Corporate Law at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians In May 2017 Painter compared the Trump administration with Nixon's scandals, saying, \\"Nixon may have been a crook, but at least he was our crook. He wasn‚Äôt a Russian agent!\\" In 2018 he said, ‚ÄúWe know there was collusion.‚Äù In early 2019 Painter told German newspaper Deutsche Welle that the indictment of Roger Stone was \\"evidence of collusion between high-ranking officials in the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to obtain documents stolen by the Russians in the 2016 election.\\" Emolument Clause lawsuit against Donald Trump In January 2017 CREW filed suit against President Donald Trump for failing to sell off certain assets and place others in a blind trust. Painter, vice-chairman of CREW, stated, \\"If Obama had tried that, we would have impeached him in two weeks.\\" CREW alleges that certain foreign payments that Trump receives are in violation of the U.S. Constitution's emoluments clause. The case was dismissed by the district court, which found that the plaintiffs lacked standing;Kroll, Andy.

CREW's appeal is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.CREW v. Donald J. Trump, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. 2018 Senate campaign Painter was a longtime Republican, saying in 2017: \\"I've been a Republican for 30 years. There's no way that I would want to see the Republican Party stand up for covering up for Russian espionage and whoever in the United States has been helping the Russians. It's going to be a disaster for the Republicans. It's going to be a disaster for our country.\\" In criticizing Trump and his administration, Painter said, \\"We are well past the point where we were in 1973 (Watergate) with respect to clear evidence of abuse of power, obstruction of justice, and other illegal activities.\\"David M. Perry, 'I've Been a Pain in the Rear for the Republican Party': A Conversation With Richard Painter, Pacific Standard (May 17, 2018). In March 2018 Painter announced that he was forming an exploratory committee to run for U.S. Senate in Minnesota, saying he was unsure whether he would seek office as a Republican, Democrat, or independent. In April 2018 he announced that he would run as a Democratic (Minnesota DFL) candidate in the primary against the incumbent Senator Tina Smith.Paul Walsh, Former George W. Bush ethics lawyer ditches GOP, to seek U.S. Senate in Minn. as Democrat, Star Tribune (April 29, 2018). Painter finished a distant second, with 14% of the vote to Smith's 76%. Political positions Painter describes himself as a centrist, and has criticized the Republican Party's move to the right since 1980. He said he would not accept the support of political action committees, super PACs, or \\"dark money\\" organizations. He supports major investments in transportation and other infrastructure projects, and is critical of stadium subsidies. Painter also declared his opposition to the Trump tariffs, in particular those on steel and aluminum. Painter favors legalizing recreational marijuana and ending the federal ban on marijuana. On gun politics, he is critical of the NRA, calling it a \\"protection racket\\" and favors \\"a license-and-registration system similar to what we have for cars.\\"  Ethics reform  To confront corruption in Washington, Painter proposed what he calls the \\"strongest ethics reform package in United States history\\": * Apply 18 U.S.C ¬ß 208, a previously existing criminal statute that prohibits all unelected federal executive branch officers from participating in any matter with which they or a spouse have a personal financial conflict of interest, to the President, Vice President, and all members of the House and Senate. * Require the President and all members of the House and Senate to divest from individual companies‚Äô stocks, bonds and other securities that create conflicts of interest, and instead invest in broadly diversified stock mutual funds, life insurance, bank accounts, and other conflict-free assets as defined in already existing Office of Government Ethics regulations. * Expand the post-government-employment ban in 18 U.S.C ¬ß 207 to include a lifetime ban on former members of the House and Senate serving as paid lobbyists, and provide that violating this ban will result in criminal penalties. * Impose term limits (six years in the House, twelve years in the Senate) for Congressional leadership positions and committee chairmanships, and dismantle the seniority system that gives more power to long-serving members. * Strip pensions of any official found guilty of violating any federal anti-corruption statute, including but not limited to 18 U.S.C ¬ß¬ß 207 and 208, bribery and gratuity statutes, insider trading laws, and other similar provisions. * Impose criminal penalties on any U.S. government official who receives profits and benefits from foreign governments in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, and mandate that the Department of Justice investigate and prosecute persons violating this prohibition.  Healthcare  Painter believes that the United States ought to support the health care system that is the most efficient and comprehensive, which he believes to be a single-payer system. He supports the following: * Passing Bernie Sanders's Medicare-for-All bill * Keeping the ACA medical device tax * Ensuring no American pays more for pharmaceuticals than their counterparts in other developed nations  Environment  Painter rejects the Trump administration's approach to carbon emissions and departure from the Paris Agreement. He believes that human-caused climate change is an existential threat to human life, and wants to make various political changes to try to prevent it, including: * Implementing a carbon tax * Removing climate change deniers from office * Reentering the Paris Agreement  Copper/nickel mining  The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness comprises nearly one million acres of pristine Minnesota lakes, forests, and wildlife. It also contains vast quantities of metals such as copper and nickel that foreign entities are trying to mine by an extremely dangerous method: sulfide mining. Painter often points out that copper/nickel mining has serious environmental consequences. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is a political office, and Painter believes Minnesotans have little reason to be confident in their ability to protect Minnesota from these consequences. The legal framework governing these kinds of mines was designed to regulate taconite extraction and does not properly address sulfide mining. Additionally, Glencore's chairman, Tony Hayward, former chairman of British Petroleum during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, gives Painter reason to question the company's commitment to safety and environmental-consciousness. For these reasons Painter vehemently opposes H.R. 3115, a bill that passed the U.S. House in early December 2017 to push through a land swap needed for the completion of the PolyMet mine, and the \\"Smith Amendment,\\" a rider added to the National Defense Authorization Act that was designed to be parallel legislation to H.R. 3115 introduced in the U.S. Senate. Enacting this legislation will void four pending lawsuits on the matter, preventing Minnesotans from questioning the legality of the land swap and eliminating the judicial branch's role. Painter also opposes the MINER Act (H.R. 3905), which would prevent the completion of a two-year Forest Service study related to economic and environmental issues associated with mining near the Boundary Waters. This act would allow PolyMet to begin mining before all the questions surrounding the sulfide mines are answered fully. Painter believes that Minnesotans have a right to know the kind of damage these mines will do to our rivers, lakes, and ecosystems before the monied interests in Washington push them through. The MINER Act also designates Minnesota as the only state in the nation unworthy of public lands protections, requiring Congressional intervention into decisions regarding public lands in Minnesota.  Clean energy  Painter has said, \\"Donald Trump‚Äôs promise to bring coal mining back to the U.S. is disingenuous. We need to move forward and expand the creation of clean jobs across the state.\\" He supports creating these jobs by expanding tax credits that can help grow solar energy farms across Minnesota. Painter believes that investing in clean energy will increase jobs in all areas of processing, such as installation, manufacturing, sales and distribution, and project development. Painter also advocates fair trade and free trade trade policies in order to protect American jobs while promoting clean energy investment. He has criticized the Trump tariffs, saying that, while using American resources is important to the economy, he believes that these tariffs will only increase the prices of goods while propping up a sector of unsustainable jobs.  Election reform  If elected, Painter promised to take the following steps to eliminate the corrupting influence of money in politics, which he believes is legalized bribery. * Introduce a bill requiring complete transparency about money in politics, including contributions to 501(c)(3) organizations, 501(c)(4) organizations, PACs, Super PACs, and any dark-money organizations engaging in communications intended to influence elections. All such contributions will be recorded by the FEC and made publicly available. * Enact a \\"Taxation Only With Representation\\" statute giving every taxpayer the right to designate the first $200 of their taxes to the campaign(s) of his/her choice. * Vote against the appointment of any Supreme Court nominee who will not, under oath, commit to overturning FEC vs. Citizens United. * Provide funding to state legislatures to organize and sponsor televised debates for both the primary and general election for all federal and statewide offices, as well as any other offices at the discretion of the legislature. Personal life Painter's wife, Karen Painter, is a professor of music history at the University of Minnesota. They have three children, and have lived in Minnesota since 2007. In July 2015 Painter was diagnosed with shingles and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2, which left his face partially paralyzed.

The southernmost volcano in the Andes, it lies on Tierra del Fuego's Cook Island and also extends over nearby Londonderry Island. The field is formed by lava domes, pyroclastic cones, and a crater lake. Volcanic activity at Fueguino is part of the Austral Volcanic Zone, which is formed by the subduction of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South America Plate. The subducting plate has not reached a depth sufficient for proper volcanic arc volcanism, however. The field bears no trace of glacial erosion on its volcanoes, and reports exist of volcanic activity in 1712, 1820 and 1926.  Geography and geology  Fueguino volcano lies in the commune of Cabo de Hornos, Chile. Cities in the region are Rio Gallegos, Puerto Natales, Punta Arenas, Rio Grande and Ushuaia.  Regional  Fueguino is the southernmost volcano in the Andes. The volcano to the north is Monte Burney, which lies northwest of Fueguino. Both volcanoes belong to the Austral Volcanic Zone. Since the Paleocene, a transform fault, which bisects the island, has been moving the southern part of Tierra del Fuego eastward along the South America Plate, accompanied by tectonic uplift that persisted into the Holocene except when it was offset by glacial loading effects. The subduction of the Nazca Plate and Antarctic Plate beneath the South America Plate is responsible for the formation of the Andean Volcanic Belt. This volcanic belt is subdivided into the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. The Austral Volcanic Zone features six Quaternary volcanoes and is long. It is separated from the Southern Volcanic Zone by the Patagonian volcanic gap, where arc volcanism ceased 12 million years ago. South of where the Chile Rise intersects the Peru-Chile Trench, the trench disappears as it is increasingly buried by sediments. However, subduction is still active as evidenced by the converging motion of the Antarctic Plate and the South America Plate and the volcanic activity. Only around 52¬∞ does the convergence change into strike- slip faulting at the Shackleton Fracture Zone. Subduction in that area commenced 17 million years ago, and the Antarctic slab has not sunk deep into the mantle. At shallow depth, magma generation is dominated by anatexis of the slab. The mantle ahead of the edge of the subducting slab may be dominated by a large slab window. Other volcanic activity occurred in the region farther east, on Hardy Peninsula and some surrounding capes and islands during the Miocene; potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 18 and 21 million years ago. These volcanic systems may indicate that the Antarctic Plate is subducting beneath the Scotia Plate. Three stages of tectonic activity have been noted; Late Cretaceous, Paleocene-Early Eocene and Middle Eocene to Oligocene.Torres Carbonell et al., 2010, p.277  Local  Fueguino lies on a peninsula on the southeastern side of Cook Island, Tierra del Fuego, but it also extends to Londonderry Island. The main Tierra del Fuego island lies northeast of Fueguino. This area of southern Tierra del Fuego is part of the Fuegian Andes, which are formed by various intrusive, effusive and metamorphic forms on the Scotia Plate. The field contains lava domes and pyroclastic cones, reaching heights of . One of these cones has a crater lake within a wide crater. Volcanic activity may be influenced by north-south trending faults.  Composition  The field has erupted andesite. Such a limited range of composition is typical for Austral Volcanic Zone volcanoes, which only feature andesite and dacite. Lava domes feature columnar joints. The surface texture of the rocks is trachytic to porphyritic. The rocks contain phenocrysts of clinopyroxene, hornblende and plagioclase. In terms of composition, the Fueguino rocks belong to the calc-alkaline series and resemble tholeiites and andesites from primitive volcanic arcs. Xenoliths from the Patagonian batholith are also found.  Basement  The field is formed on top of plutonic rocks, which were scoured by glaciation. At the south coast of Tierra del Fuego, volcanic activity provided the late Jurassic formation known as the Lemaire Formation. Later, during the Cretaceous, the Yaghan Formation consisting of marine sediments was deposed on top of the Lemaire Formation. The basement of Fueguino consists of an ophiolite of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age. The ophiolitic sequence contains pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, titanomagnetite, cubanite and pyrite.Coloma et al., 2009, p.3  Eruptive history  The volcanoes were unaffected by glacial activity, and potassium-argon dating has indicated a near absence of radiogenic argon. Myths of the Yaghan people of a \\"world fire\\" may be a reference to volcanism at Fueguino, but they could also refer to an impact event. Ships passing in the area reported volcanic activity in 1712 and 1820. The former eruption, dated around 26 November is uncertain. It was reported by French captain Josselin Guardin; the volcano was marked on maps as Volcan San Clemente, after Gardin's ship. The latter eruption was observed on the 25-26 November by HMS Conway captained by Basil Hall, and involved the eruption of incandescent material. According to reports it lasted intermittently for the whole morning that day. A volcanic explosivity index of 2 has been estimated. These volcanic activities were at first assumed to have occurred in the local Andes mountains, but a geological expedition by Giacomo Bove in 1882 found no evidence of a volcano there; the field itself was accidentally discovered by geologists of SERNAGEOMIN in 1978. Further activity may have occurred on 3 February 1926, when a ship travelling through the northeastern arm of the Beagle Channel encountered a cloud of ash. Such a cloud may have been transported to the ship's location by southwesterly winds from Fueguino. Most recently, seismic swarms far south of Puerto Williams in 2018 were associated with Fueguino in the media.  Climate and vegetation  The vegetation of the area belongs to the Magellanic Province, formed by deciduous trees at low altitudes. Peatlands and bogs are widespread. The climate is temperate and cold, with temperatures of about and precipitation decreasing northeastward. Sea surface temperatures in the Beagle Channel range . The Fuegian Andes are covered by an ice sheet with outlet glaciers, although only on the Chilean side. During the ice ages, a substantial ice cap covered the Patagonian and Fuegian Andes. Two stages of glaciation have been identified in southern Tierra del Fuego; four more have been found north of the Magellan Strait.

The character was originally introduced as third sidekick under the Bucky identity, and he later the most well-known incarnation of Nomad. Publication history A character with a complicated history, Jack Monroe's origin involves a complex series of retcons. Although the character's first real appearance is as \\"Bucky\\" in Captain America #153, the origin of the character, first revealed in Captain America #155 (again by Englehart and Buscema), identifies him as the \\"Bucky\\" that appeared in Captain America comics which were originally published in the 1950s. When they were first published between 1953 and 1954 those Captain America stories, which were written by Stan Lee and illustrated by Mort Lawrence and John Romita, Sr., starred Steve Rogers (the original Captain America) and Bucky and were clearly set in the 1950s, with the duo prominently battling communism and a communist Red Skull. However, when the character returned in Avengers #4 (March 1964), it is revealed that the original Captain America has been in a state of suspended animation since a battle he fought near the close of World War II, a battle in which the original Bucky perished. The 1950s stories were thus considered outside of official canon until Englehart's 1972 Captain America storyline (#153‚Äì156; September‚ÄìDecember 1972), which attempted to resolve the discrepancy by showing how a teenager (Monroe is simply referred to as \\"Bucky\\" throughout, the name \\"Jack Monroe\\" was introduced in later stories) and an unnamed man (later known as \\"The Grand Director\\") had assumed both the public and private identities of the original Captain America and Bucky as part of a government-sponsored program which planned to replace the lost heroes to combat the \\"red threat\\". Captain America #155, which reveals how the two gain super-powers by injecting themselves with a \\"Super-Soldier Formula\\" that they find in old Nazi files. The formula initially grants them abilities similar to those of the original Captain America (Steve Rogers). However, the formula made no mention of the essential Vita-ray exposure portion of the treatment and the absence causes its effects to eventually give them psychotic symptoms. As a result, the two are arrested and put into suspended animation by government agents. This complicated origin is the reason that some sources list Young Men #24 (December 1953; the first appearance of the communist hunting Captain America and Bucky) as Monroe's first appearance, though the issue was originally intended to depict the original Bucky. A later story, What If #4, (August 1977), further complicates the Bucky history by introducing another \\"Bucky\\" (Fred Davis) that takes on the role in 1945, many years before Monroe assumes the title, which makes Monroe the third \\"Bucky\\" chronologically. Monroe was mostly portrayed as essentially having the same powers as the first Captain America, Steve Rogers. This has long been a matter of contention in the comics as Monroe received his powers from the same sample of the Super-Soldier Serum that gave the 1950s Captain America superhuman strength. He became super strong but after being exposed to stabilizing rays (similar to the Vita-rays Steve Rogers received) his strength normalized to peak human. In Captain America #153‚Äì156 \\"Bucky\\" and his partner are briefly reawakened decades after being put in suspended animation. In Captain America #232‚Äì236 (April‚ÄìAugust 1979) ‚Äî by writers Roger McKenzie, Jim Shooter and Michael Fleisher and artist Sal Buscema ‚Äî \\"Captain America\\" is revived and brainwashed into becoming the fascistic \\"Grand Director\\", who shoots and apparently kills his former partner Bucky and later apparently commits suicide. Writer J. M. DeMatteis resurrected the \\"Bucky\\" character in Captain America #281 (May 1983), which is the first comic that names him as \\"Jack Monroe\\". That story reveals that the gun was loaded with blanks, and the cured Monroe is given the Nomad identity by Steve Rogers in Captain America #282 (June 1983). Nomad then becomes Captain America's partner for the next two years of published comics. DeMatteis' successor as writer of the series, Mark Gruenwald, had Nomad end the partnership in Captain America #309 (September 1985). Gruenwald said he did this \\"because Nomad made Cap seem old. Cap had to take the mentor relationship with Nomad, and he was coming off as everyone's favorite father figure rather than as the active vital superhero.\\" However, Gruenwald continued to feature the character in Captain America intermittently. He features in Captain America #324‚Äì325 (December 1986‚ÄìJanuary 1987), and after Steve Rogers is stripped of his Captain America identity, Nomad appears in a storyline which continues for over a year of Captain America stories (#336‚Äì350; December 1987‚ÄìFebruary 1989) where Nomad is one of Rogers's partners as he continues being a superhero under the identity of \\"The Captain\\". During this storyline Nomad is depicted as a tetchy and insolent character who takes an instant disliking to Demolition Man, a dislike which only increases when it becomes evident that Vagabond is attracted to him. Though not explicitly stated in the stories themselves, the Captain America letters pages explained that the formula which gave Nomad his powers was again causing him to become aggressive and mentally unstable. The character next starred in the eight page story \\"Angel in the Snow\\" in Marvel Comics Presents #14 (March 1989), which was written by Fabian Nicieza, a writer who would go on to script most of the character's appearances in the following decade and a half. The story is followed up in a backup story in Captain America Annual #9 (1989), in which Monroe discards his spandex outfit and becomes an urban vigilante. In 1990, Nomad starred in an eponymous four- issue miniseries, written by Nicieza and penciled by James Fry III (November 1990‚ÄìFebruary 1991). Captain America Annual #10 features a prologue to the upcoming Nomad ongoing series. Again written by Nicieza, the series lasted 25 issues (May 1992‚ÄìMay 1994) and featured artwork from several artists, most notably Pat Olliffe and S. Clarke Hawbaker. At one point in the series Monroe spends an extended period in Los Angeles, California and in one issue (#9; January 1993) Nicieza addresses the subject of the 1992 Los Angeles riots which had recently occurred when the story was first published. In an interview around this time, Nicieza commented, \\"There are times when I start burning out, getting sick of comics. And then, I'll start plotting or scripting an issue of Nomad, and by the time I'm done, I feel great. ... [Nomad is] about Jack Munroe trying to cope with a life that he doesn't have any control over, it's about America, and it's about life. Jack also uses so many detective cliches that it's a blast writing his dialogue ‚Äî where else can I use, 'The french fries were wetter than a swimsuit calendar'?\\" \\"Dead Man's Hand\\", a crossover with the Punisher War Journal and Daredevil series also being published at that time, sees Nomad teaming up with the Punisher and Daredevil against a coalition of criminal organizations. The title was also involved in the 1993 Infinity Crusade crossover, and in his own series, Nomad confronts an evil clone of Gambit. At the close of the Nomad ongoing series, the character was believed dead. In Thunderbolts #49 (April 2001) it was revealed that he was in fact placed in suspended animation and was revived and temporarily brainwashed into being a new version of the Scourge character. Monroe is next shown by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Steve Epting in Captain America (vol. 5) #3 (April 2005) being shot dead by a mysterious assailant, later revealed to be the original Bucky, now known as the Winter Soldier. Captain America (vol. 5) #7 (July 2005) by Brubaker and artist John Paul Leon then reveals the events of the last few days of Monroe's life. Fictional character biography Jack Monroe was born in Naugatuck, Connecticut. He became an adventurer and the partner of William Burnside who had assumed the identity of Steve Rogers in the 1950s. After operating together for some time as Bucky and Captain America, respectively, the two were placed in suspended animation. The two superheroes are reawakened decades after being put in suspended animation. In their delusional state, the man and teenager who were the 1950s Captain America and Bucky attempt to kill the original Captain America and the Falcon. However they are eventually captured and returned to a state of suspended animation.Captain America #153‚Äì156 Burnside is later revived and brainwashed by the psychologist Doctor Faustus into becoming the fascistic Grand Director, leader of the National Force. Under Faustus' control Burnside shoots and apparently kills his former partner Bucky. Faustus and Burnside are defeated by the original Captain America and Daredevil after which Burnside commits suicide.Captain America #232‚Äì236 (April‚ÄìAugust 1979) It is later revealed that Faustus had loaded the gun with blanks as he intended to use Monroe in a later plot which was never realized. Monroe was subsequently taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and seemingly cured of his psychotic symptoms. Monroe then sought out Steve Rogers, and dons a Bucky costume to help him defeat the female terrorist Viper.Captain America #281 (May 1983) Monroe is then given Rogers' former Nomad identity, and Monroe dons the Nomad costume to battle the Viper alongside Captain America.Captain America #282 (June 1983) Nomad next battled the Slayer.Captain America #293‚Äì294 Nomad then became Captain America's partner, and battled the Sisters of Sin.Captain America #295 As Bucky, he psychologically battled Baron Zemo.Captain America #297 Nomad helped Captain America defeat the Red Skull, a conflict in which the Red Skull seemingly perished.Captain America #298‚Äì300; October‚ÄìDecember 1984 Nomad completed a successful solo mission apprehending the deranged Madcap, and afterwards ends his partnership with Captain America.Captain America #309 (September 1985) Nomad later obtained a new costume, and battled the Slug, dismantling his criminal empire with Captain America's assistance.Captain America #324‚Äì325 (December 1986‚ÄìJanuary 1987) Monroe returns again after Steve Rogers is stripped of the Captain America identity by the Commission on Superhuman Activities.Captain America #336 (December 1987) Rogers continues being a superhero under the identity of \\"The Captain\\" and, wearing a black version of his regular costume, he begins traveling the country fighting evil with a group of his former partners, including Nomad, Demolition Man and the Falcon. The group also includes Nomad's then-girlfriend, a neophyte adventurer who goes by the codename Vagabond. During this storyline Nomad is depicted as a tetchy and insolent character who takes an instant disliking to Demolition Man, a dislike increased by an apparent attraction between Vagabond and Demolition Man. Nomad battled Vibro.Captain America #340 When a faction of the Serpent Society under the leadership of the terrorist Viper attempts to poison the Washington, DC water supply, The Captain and his team intervenes. During these events, Nomad, Vagabond, and Demolition Man are captured by The Commission and imprisoned. The former Serpent Society leader known as Sidewinder uses his teleportation ability to enter the jail and free Diamondback, a Society member who has remained loyal to Sidewinder and helped The Captain fight Viper, and as a result was in jail, too. Sidewinder offers to free the other heroes imprisoned there, but Vagabond and Demolition Man turn him down, saying that they think it was wrong to flee the authorities. Nomad scoffs at this notion, and decides to leave the jail with Sidewinder and Diamondback.Captain America #342‚Äì344 This incident ends his relationship with Vagabond. The Captain approaches Nomad for help, but finds Nomad in a bar, drunk. Upon finding out Rogers plans to give himself up to the Commission, Nomad refuses to help him and the two men part on bad terms.Captain America #345 (September 1988) Going solo again, Nomad began a war against drug dealer Umberto Safilios.Marvel Comics Presents #14 Monroe later discards his spandex outfit choosing to become an urban vigilante.Captain America Annual #9 (1989) Monroe kidnaps an infant girl from her drug addicted mother, naming her \\"Bucky\\". The Commission on Superhuman Activities begins to put Monroe under scrutiny. The Commission, allied with the military, sends Steve Rogers (now restored to the Captain America role) to try and subdue Nomad. In a subsequent firefight Nomad defeats Safilios, and kills several drug dealers and government officials.Nomad (vol. 1) #1‚Äì4 (November 1990‚ÄìFebruary 1991). Nomad begins to spend some time on the road, dealing with problems not usually the purview of superheroes, such as AIDS, homelessness, and hate crimes.Nomad (vol. 2) #1 At one point Monroe spends an extended period in Los Angeles, California. While in L.A. Nomad becomes loosely affiliated with the \\"Undergrounders\\", a network of people across America who willingly help each other out in need. This allows Nomad access to trusted babysitters when he needs to enter situations far, far too dangerous for Bucky (though many think Nomad's life is consistently far too dangerous). During this phase of his life, Nomad sheds much of his previous acerbic, self- destructive personality, and becomes a more laid-back, compassionate person. Later Nomad realizes that both he and/or Bucky could be infected with HIV, Bucky due to her parentage and Nomad due to his time receiving medical care from the Undergrounders. He has himself and Bucky tested but it is never revealed if either of them are infected. Nomad later teams up with the Punisher and Daredevil against a coalition of criminal organizations.Nomad #4‚Äì6, Punisher War Journal #45-47, Daredevil #307-309 (August-October 1992) During the Infinity Crusade, Nomad is shown among dozens of superheroes who travel into outer space. Nomad doesn't have much involvement in the events, however, and he and Forge are literally seen hanging around during much of the action.Infinity Crusade #1‚Äì6 Nomad does confront an evil clone of Gambit who had gotten lost on the way to the battles.Nomad #7 (November 1992) Around this time, Nomad is one of the heroes recruited by Doctor Strange to battle the demonic threat of Lilin, a powerful ancient queen.The Secret Defenders #1‚Äì3 (1993) During his time on the road, Nomad confronts the Hate-Monger, Man-Thing and even the mother of Bucky herself, who had been brainwashed into a trained assassin sent to kill him. The assassination training is done by the 'Favor Broker', an adversary who plagues Nomad throughout much of his series. Nomad is eventually believed dead after a confrontation with his old hometown's Nazi militia (Monroe's father had been a Nazi sympathizer during World War II) but it was revealed that he was in fact placed in suspended animation. An innocent bystander's body was used to replace his.Nomad (vol. 2) #25 Some time later, Henry Gyrich revives Monroe and infuses his body with nanites that placed him under command, and turned Monroe into a new version of the Scourge of the Underworld.Thunderbolts #49 (April 2001) Though Monroe was conscious and aware of his actions, he could neither resist Gyrich's orders nor reveal his true identity or details of his servitude to anyone. As Scourge, he battled the Thunderbolts who eventually freed him from Gyrich's control.Thunderbolts #34‚Äì50 (March 2000‚ÄìMay 2001) After returning to his original Nomad costume and identity, Monroe began to relapse into some psychotic episodes and symptoms. At this time, Monroe had checked in on his former ward he called Bucky who had since been adopted. Jack is shot dead by a mysterious assailant as he leaves a bar.Captain America (vol. 5) #3 (April 2005) The cyborg assassin Winter Soldier is ultimately revealed to be Monroe's assassin.Captain America (vol. 5) #7 (July 2005) Powers and abilities While Jack Monroe's strength, endurance, reflexes, and agility were not beyond the limits of the human body, they were superior to that of any Olympic athlete who ever competed. As a result of not going through the Vita-Ray process, his transformation eventually drove him insane and gave him a form of cancer. As Nomad, he wore a pair of stun-discs on each shoulder near the collarbone. These tool-steel alloy discs could be thrown as projectile weapons. Monroe has extensive experience in hand-to-hand combat, having received personal tutoring by Captain America. He is also an expert marksman. As Scourge, he had access to an array of equipment based on devices confiscated from costumed criminals, created for the Scourge identity by the Commission on Superhuman Activities on Henry Gyrich's orders. Such items seen in use by Monroe include versions of the Goblin glider, the Unicorn's energy-projecting headgear, and Stilt-Man's telescoping legs, as well as other unspecified weaponry. Certain items were installed in the Scourge costume, while others were miniaturized with Pym particles and stored in one of the costume's gauntlets; all of this equipment was accessible through voice-coded commands. Monroe was also able to use his gauntlet's store of Pym particles to alter his own size or that of other people and objects; however, his supply of the particles was not infinite, and exhausting that supply could force him to abandon much of his stored weaponry.

Founding Congress, May 27, 2017 Ideology The party shares much with the UNM's liberal conservatism, with the main difference between the two being their approach to politics. Among other things, European Georgia has a stronger commitment to contesting rather than boycotting elections.

It is the first new whiskey distillery to have opened in Dublin, once a world whiskey distilling capital, in over 125 years. In fact, with the last of the original Dublin distilleries having closed in 1976, it is the first whiskey distillery to operate in Dublin, once home to at least 37 distilleries, in almost 40 years. The distillery was established by Jack and Stephen Teeling, whose father John Teeling had founded the Cooley Distillery in 1987. It is located in the Liberties area of Dublin, close to where Walter Teeling, an ancestor of the family had established a distillery on Marrowbone Lane in 1782. The symbol of the brand, a phoenix rising from a pot still, symbolises the re-establishment of the Teeling whiskey brand.  Background   Ancestral activity In 1782, Walter Teeling, established a distillery on Dublin's Marrowbone Lane, in the Liberties area of Dublin, then an epicentre of distilling dubbed the \\"golden triangle\\" due to the number of distilleries located in the area. Although now long gone, some of the distilleries in the Liberties area at the time, were very large operations, with George Roe's Thomas Street Distillery likely being the largest distillery in the world at its peak. Eventually, the Teeling Distillery was purchased by a larger neighbouring operation, William Jameson & Co., which was also based on Marrowbone Street. However, William Jameson's distillery, run by relatives of the more famous John Jameson, later closed in 1923, having like many Irish distilleries, encountered serious financial difficulties in the early 20th century. 20th century In 1987, John Teeling, a descendant of Walter Teeling purchased a facility in Cooley, Co. Louth which had previously been set up by the Irish Free State Government to produce industrial alcohol from potatoes. Teeling converted this plant to a whiskey distillery, reopening it in 1989 as Cooley Distillery. The distillery was the first new distillery to launch in Ireland following the consolidations and closures of the 20th century.  History  John Teeling's two sons, Jack and Stephen, worked with their father at Cooley Distillery. When it was sold to Beam Inc. (now Beam Suntory) in 2011.Jack, then Managing Director, left, while his brother stayed on for about a year. As part of the sale, the Teelings negotiated the purchase of 16,000 casks of aged whiskey. Using these stocks, Jack Teeling launched Teeling Whiskey in 2012, and was later joined in the venture by his brother Stephen. In 2015, the Teelings established a new whiskey distillery in Newmarket Square in Dublin‚Äôs south inner city, not far from the location of the original Teeling Distillery on Marrowbone Lane. The distillery, which includes a visitor centre, now employs some 55 staff, and exports to 44 countries.  Popular culture  Construction of the distillery was the subject of a four-part TV3 documentary, \\"Whiskey Business\\", which first aired in 2015.  Bottlings  Bottles of Small Batch and Single Grain Teeling Irish Whiskey To date, all Teeling whiskeys are 46% ABV and non-chill filtered. Several styles have been launched, including: * Teeling Small Batch, finished in ex-Rum barrels * Teeling Single Grain, matured in Californian cabernet sauvignon barrels * Teeling Single Malt, vatted from whiskey finished in five different types of wine cask (Sherry, Port, Madeira, White Burgundy, Cabernet Sauvignon) *Teeling Single Pot Still, produced from a mash bill of 50% malted and 50% unmalted barley, and aged for three years in ex-Muscat barrels * Teeling The Revival 13-year-old, matured in ex-Bourbon casks for 12 years, and finished in an ex-Calvados cask for 1 year * Teeling Vintage Reserve 24-year-old Single Malt * Teeling Vintage Reserve 33-year-old Single Malt In addition, a Poit√≠n (a traditional Irish clear-spirit) has been launched: * Teeling Spirit of Dublin Poit√≠n, 50-52.5% ABV  Accolades  The Teeling whiskeys have already been the recipients of several awards.

The Biennale is organised by the Archaos circus company and the first edition in 2015 attracted 60 circus companies from around the world and had more than 85,000 visitors. History The Archaos circus company is one of the legendary contemporary circus companies in Europe. Their work in Britain changed the way the circus was seen and the founder of Archaos, Pierrot Bidon, was seen as a circus revolutionary. In Bidon's obituary in The Guardian, Archaos was described as \\"one of the ensembles that galvanised the new circus movement, in which traditional arts have been re-imagined and combined with contemporary artistic sensibilities and theatrical techniques.\\" The Biennale itself was born out of the Circus in Capitals project that Archaos managed as part of Marseille-Provence 2013, the European Capital of Culture festivities. The success of the circus arts during the Marseille Provence 2013 inspired the Archaos company to create the first Biennale Internationale des Arts du Cirque in 2015. The first biennale featured circus companies such as Nofit State Circus, Cirque √âloize, and the Chinese State Circus. The first Biennale was such a success that in 2016 the company created the L'Entre‚ÄìDeux Biennales to meet public demand and continue to foster the circus arts in years when the Biennale was not being held. Archaos was nominated for the Best Producer award for the L'Entre-Deux Biennales project at the 2016 Annual International Professional Circus Awards in Sochi, Russia that were organised by the Russian Ministry of Culture. Archaos was also chosen to present performances at the Club France that was held during the Rio Olympics in August 2016. 2017 Biennale The second edition of the Biennale ran from January 21 to February 19, 2017. It featured more than 260 performances in close to 30 cities in the south of France including Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, Grasse, and Gap. The 2017 Biennale included new work from leading British companies NoFit State Circus and Motionhouse, the Swedish company Cirkus Cirk√∂r, and the Brazilian company Borogodo.

There are many ways that nations have accomplished regime change abroad, and electoral intervention is only one of those methods. Theoretical and empirical research on the effect of foreign electoral intervention had been characterized as weak overall as late as 2011; however, since then a number of such studies have been conducted. One study indicated that the country intervening in most foreign elections is the United States with 81 interventions, followed by Russia (including the former Soviet Union) with 36 interventions from 1946 to 2000‚Äîan average of once in every nine competitive elections. Tharoor, Ishaan (13 October 2016). \\"The long history of the U.S. interfering with elections elsewhere\\". The Washington Post. Retrieved 21 May 2019.Levin, Dov H. (7 September 2016). \\"Sure, the U.S. and Russia often meddle in foreign elections. Does it matter?\\". The Washington Post. Retrieved 21 May 2019. Academic studies Measurement of interventions A 2019 study by L√ºhrmann et al. at the Varieties of Democracy Institute in Sweden summarized reports from each country to say that in 2018 the most intense interventions, by means of false information on key political issues, were by China in Taiwan and by Russia in Latvia; the next highest levels were in Bahrain, Qatar and Hungary; the lowest levels were in Trinidad and Tobago, Switzerland and Uruguay. A 2016 study by Dov H. Levin found that, among 938 global elections examined, the United States and Russia (including its predecessor, the Soviet Union) combined had involved themselves in about one out of nine (117), with the majority of those (68%) being through covert, rather than overt, actions. The same study found that \\"on average, an electoral intervention in favor of one side contesting the election will increase its vote share by about 3 percent,\\" an effect large enough to have potentially changed the results in seven out of 14 U.S. presidential elections occurring after 1960. According to the study, the U.S. intervened in 81 foreign elections between 1946 and 2000, while the Soviet Union or Russia intervened in 36. A 2018 study by Levin found that the electoral interventions determined in \\"many cases\\" the identity of the winner. The study also found suggestive evidence that the interventions increased the risk of democratic breakdown in the targeted states. Typologies of interventions In a 2012 study, Corstange and Marinov theorized that there are two types of foreign intervention: partisan intervention, where the foreign power takes a stance on its support for one side, and process intervention, where the foreign power seeks \\"to support the rules of democratic contestation, irrespective of who wins\\". Their results from 1,703 participants found that partisan interventions had a polarizing effect on political and foreign relations views, with the side favored by the external power more likely to favor improvements in relations between the two, and having the converse effect for those opposed by the power. In 2018, Jonathan Godinez further elaborated on Corstange and Marinov's theory by proposing that interventions can be specified as globally- motivated intervention, where \\"a country intervenes in the election of another country for the interests, betterment, or well-being of the international audience,\\" and self-motivated intervention, where \\"a country intervenes in the election of another country to further the interests, betterment, or well- being of themselves.\\" Godinez further theorized that the vested interest of an intervening country can be identified by examining a \\"threefold methodology\\": the tactics of intervention, stated motivation, and the magnitude of the intervention. Also in 2012, Shulman and Bloom theorized a number of distinct factors affecting the results of foreign interference: * Agents of interference: each with a descending effect on resentment caused by their intervention, these being nations, international organizations, non- governmental organizations, and finally individuals. * Partisanship of interference: whether foreign actors intervene to affect institutions and process broadly, or intervene primarily to favor one side in a contest * Salience of interference: consisting of two elements. First, \\"how obvious and well-known is the interference\\", and second, \\"how clear and understandable is the intervention?\\" Additionally, they theorized that national similarities between the foreign and domestic powers would decrease resentment, and may even render the interference welcome. In cases where national autonomy are of primary concern to the electorate, they predicted a diminished effect of the similarity or dissimilarity of the two powers on resentment. Conversely, they predicted that in cases where national identity was a primary concern, the importance of similarity or dissimilarity would have a greater impact.  Impact of interventions  According to a 2020 study, Americans \\"are more likely to condemn foreign involvement, lose faith in democracy, and seek retaliation when a foreign power sides with the opposition, than when a foreign power aids their own party. At the same time, Americans reject military responses to electoral attacks on the United States, even when their own political party is targeted.\\" Bolivian election (by United States, 2002) In the Bolivian elections of 2002, the U.S., which had been financing the eradication of coca farms, instructed Ambassador Manuel Rocha to warn Bolivians against voting for socialist candidate Evo Morales, stating that doing so could \\"jeopardize American assistance and investment.\\" USAID also create the \\"political party reform project\\" in Bolivia in 2002, whose aim was to \\"help build moderate, pro-democracy political parties that can serve as a counterweight to the radical MAS or its successors\\". The move largely backfired, increasing support for Morales, who finished second in the election. Chilean elections Chilean workers marching in support of Allende in 1964. 1970 election (by United States) According to information released as part of the findings of the Church Committee, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency supported the kidnapping of the Chilean Army Commander-in- Chief General Ren√© Schneider in an attempt to prevent the congressional confirmation of Salvador Allende. The attempt failed and Schneider was shot in the process. He died three days later from his wounds. Thereafter, the U.S. continued a vigorous overt and covert campaign to undermine Allende's Presidency, which may have created the conditions for Allende's overthrow in a violent coup, although the U.S. was not directly implicated in the coup. American official Henry Kissinger was quoted by Newsweek in 1974 saying this about Chile: \\"I don't see why we have to let a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people\\".Nutter, John (2000). The CIA's Black Ops: Covert Action, Foreign Policy, and Democracy. Prometheus Books. p. 107. . 1964 election (by United States and Soviet Union) Between 1960 and 1969, the Soviet government funded the Communist Party of Chile at a rate of between $50,000 and $400,000 annually. In the 1964 Chilean elections the U.S. government supplied $2.6 million in funding for candidate Eduardo Frei Montalva, whose opponent, Salvador Allende was a prominent Marxist, as well as additional funding with the intention of harming Allende's reputation. As Kristian Gustafson phrased the situation: > It was clear the Soviet Union was operating in Chile to ensure Marxist > success, and from the contemporary American point of view, the United States > was required to thwart this enemy influence: Soviet money and influence were > clearly going into Chile to undermine its democracy, so U.S. funding would > have to go into Chile to frustrate that pernicious influence. The U.S. involvement was later revealed by the Church Committee in 1975.  French election   2007 election (by Libya)  According to French newspaper Mediapart, Nicolas Sarkozy's presidential campaign received 50 million Euros in donations from the Libyan leader, colonel Muammar Gaddafi, which is over twice the French limit for individual campaign donations of 22 million Euros. After Sarkozy's victory, Gaddafi went on a 5-day state visit to France, during which the Libyan government purchased military equipment, including 14 Rafale fighter jets. Ziad Takieddine, a French-Lebanese businessman with close ties to Libya, admitted to Mediapart that he had made three trips from Tripoli to France to deliver suitcases filled with 200 and 500 euro notes to Sarkozy. After the election, Gaddafi was invited. In March 2018, Sarkozy was held in custody over these allegations. He was interrogated for 25 hours by the police, during which he denied any wrongdoing, before being released under special judicial supervision. 2017 election (by Russia) The 2017 Macron e-mail leaks were leaks of more than 20,000 e-mails related to the campaign of Emmanuel Macron during the 2017 French presidential elections, two days before the final vote. The leaks garnered an abundance of media attention due to how quickly news of the leak spread throughout the Internet, aided in large part by bots and spammers and drew accusations that the government of Russia under Vladimir Putin was responsible. The e-mails were shared by WikiLeaks and several American alt-right activists through social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, and 4chan.

The goal of this non-profit organization is to encourage a two state solution, and the grant money was intended to fund local activists promoting such a solution in both Israel itself, and in Palestine. Palestinians cannot vote in Israeli elections, therefore at best $233,550 could have been spent on Israeli election interference.

At the advice of Walter Dowling, the U.S. also invited Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi on an official visit and made a number of related economic concessions. Conversely, the Soviet Union funneled as much as $10 million monthly to the communists and leveraged its influence on Italian companies via contracts to support them. However, many of their efforts were ad hoc in comparison, and the Christian Democrats eventually won in a landslide.

According to Gordenker, the commission acted: > in such a way as to affect the controlling political decisions regarding > elections in Korea. Moreover, UNTCOK deliberately and directly took a hand > in the conduct of the 1948 election. Conversely the Soviet Union forbade such elections in the north of the peninsula all together.

The team consisted of Steven Moore, Joe Shumate, George Gorton and Richard Dresner, who worked in Russia four months and received $250,000, plus payment of all costs and unlimited budget to conduct surveys and other activities. Simultaneously the US administration ensured a US$10.2 billion IMF loan to Russia to keep the national economy and pro-Western liberal government afloat. The loan funds were fraudulently misused by Yeltsin's inner circle, and the IMF knowingly turned a blind eye to these facts. Although the aggressive pro-Yeltsin campaign boosted his approval rate from an initial 6% to the 35% that he got during the first round of elections, and later made him win the second round against the Communist competitor, Gennady Zyuganov, with 54% to 41%, there were wide speculations that the official results were rigged.  Sri Lankan election (by India, 2015)  It was alleged that the Indian foreign intelligence agency had played a role in uniting the Sri Lankan opposition, to bring about the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa. There had been growing concern in the Indian government, on the increasing influence of economic and military rival China in Sri Lankan affairs. Rajapaksa further upped the ante by allowing 2 Chinese submarines to dock in 2014, without informing India, in spite of a stand still agreement to this effect between India and Sri Lanka. The growing Chinese tilt of Rajapaksa was viewed by India with unease. Further, it was alleged, that a RAW agent, helped coordination of talks within the opposition, and convincing former PM Ranil Wickremasinghe not to stand against Rajapaksa, but to choose a common opposition candidate, who had better chances of winning. The agent is also alleged to have been in touch with Chandrika Kumaratunga, who played a key role in convincing Maithripala Sirisena to be the common candidate.  Taiwanese election (by China, 2018)  Taiwan's leaders, including President Tsai Ing-wen and Premier William Lai, have repeatedly accused China of spreading fake news via social media to influence voters and support candidates more sympathetic to Beijing ahead of the 2018 Taiwanese local elections.  Togolese election (by France, 2010)  Vincent Bollor√©, a French billionaire close to then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy, allegedly gave financial support to presidential candidate Faure Gnassingb√© in the 2010 Togolese presidential election. He is accused of having offered a Gnassingb√© discount on advertisements from his ad agency, which he failed to offer to his opponent, Jean-Pierre Fabre. Gnassingb√© went on to becomebtll the Togolese president and gave port concessions to Bollor√©'s company. Bollor√© formally denies any wrongdoing.

The Russian government publicly attempted to influence the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. Russian President Vladimir Putin gave public support for candidate Viktor Yanukovych and made public visits to Ukraine on his behalf. According to Kempe and Solonenko, \\"The overall interest of the Russian elite was to keep Ukraine as a reliable neighbor and partner.\\" This was accomplished by channeling Russian funding and expertise directly into the campaign of Yanukovych or the government of Ukraine, in an effort described as \\"nakedly partisan\\". Meanwhile, the U.S., Canada, Poland and Slovakia gave money to build political parties in Ukraine. 2014 election (by Russia) Pro-Russian hackers launched a series of cyberattacks over several days to disrupt the May 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, releasing hacked emails, attempting to alter vote tallies, and delaying the final result with distributed denial-of-service attacks.

On 13 February 2020, American intelligence officials advised members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 election in an effort to get Trump re-elected. China and Iran were found to support the candidacy of Joe Biden though no active election interference by either country was reported.

In January 2017, following a British intelligence tip-off, the U.S. Intelligence Community expressed \\"high confidence\\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign designed to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections, undermine confidence in the U.S. democratic process, harm Secretary Hillary Clinton's chances, and help Donald Trump win. =2016 election (by Ukraine)= Putin's Asymmetric Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe: Implications for U.S. National Security In July 2016, candidate Donald Trump was asked about the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/trump-crimea/493280/ Trump's statement indicating that he would recognize Crimea as Russian caused alarm in Ukraine, with the Ukrainian Ambassador to the USA Valeriy Chaly writing an article critical of Trump for breaking from the Republican party platform.https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/290411-ukraines- ambassador-trumps-comments-send-wrong-message-to Other prominent Ukrainian politicians wrote highly critical social media posts, including former prime minister, Arseny Yatseniuk and interior minister Arsen Avakov.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/11/22/trump-complains- ukraine-hated-him-candidate-lots-foreign-officials-opposed-him/ In August 2016, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and Ukrainian legislator Serhiy Leshchenko publicized ledgers alleging that Paul Manafort (Donald Trump's campaign manager) had received $12.7 million in illicit payments from Ukraine's pro-Russia Party of Regions.

Although it was recognized that negotiations were nearing a successful conclusion, the government of Iran delayed their release until after the election, potentially in retaliation for the decision of Carter to admit the deposed Iranian leader Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to the United States for cancer treatment. Opinions differ as to the intentional nature of the delay with regard to the outcome of the election. A ten-month investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives concluded that there was \\"virtually no credible evidence to support the accusations.\\" However, former Iranian President Abolhassan Banisadr claimed there was a deal between Reagan and Iran to delay the release in exchange for arms. 1968 election (by South Vietnam) In the last months of the presidential election between Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey, President Lyndon B.

McKone and Freeman B. Olmstead. The Soviets held on to those two prisoners, in order to avoid giving Nixon (who was the incumbent Vice-President of the United States) an opportunity to boast about his ability to work with the Soviets, and the two Air Force officers were released just days after Kennedy's inauguration, on 25 January 1961. Khrushchev later bragged that Kennedy acknowledged the Soviet help: \\"You're right. I admit you played a role in the election and cast your vote for me....\\" Former Soviet ambassador to the United States Oleg Troyanovsky confirms Kennedy's acknowledgment, but also quotes Kennedy doubting whether the Soviet support made a difference: \\"I don't think it affected the elections in any way.\\"\\"Interview with Oleg Troyanowski\\", National Security Archive (15 November 1998). 1940 election (by Nazi Germany) In October 1940, seeking to derail the reelection of incumbent U.S. President Franklin D.

Young is regarded as a pioneer in the writing of the social history of the American Revolution and was a founding editor of the academic journal Labor: Studies in Working-Class History of the Americas. Biography Early years Alfred Fabian Young, known to family and friends as \\"Al,\\" was born January 17, 1925, in New York City.Michael D. Hattem, \\"Roundtable: The Legacy of Alfred F. Young,\\" The Junto, Nov. 3, 2014. He was the second son of Gerson Yungowitz, a Polish-born Jew who had grown up in London, and the former Fanny Denitzen, an East European √©migr√© to America.Gary B. Nash, \\"In Memoriam: Alfred F. Young,\\" Uncommon Sense, Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture, no. 131 (Winter 2013). The family surname was Americanized to Young after his father's arrival in America. His parents divorced when Al was a child and he was raised by his mother in suburban Jamaica, New York.\\"An Outsider and the Progress of a Career in History,\\" William and Mary Quarterly, vol. 52, no. 3 (July 1995), pg. 500. Young attended public schools, graduating from Jamaica High School in Jamaica, Queens at the age of 16, academically ranked 4th in his class of 400 students. He subsequently attended Queens College, from which he graduated in 1946 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics. His experience at Queens College was important in his intellectual development as a budding social historian with an emphasis on the working class, as it was there that he studied under pioneer industrial historian Vera Shlakman as well as scholar of the Haymarket affair and biographer of Terence Powderly, Henry David. Young went on to earn a Master's degree from Columbia University in 1947, from whence he moved to Northwestern University near Chicago, where he began work on a PhD. After three years of course work at Northwestern, Young took a series of teaching jobs at three eastern universities, while continuing to work on his dissertation in his spare time. He was ultimately awarded his PhD by Northwestern in 1958. His thesis title was \\"The Democratic-Republican movement in New York State, 1788-1797\\". In 1952 Young married Marilyn Mills, with whom he ultimately raised three daughters. Academic career After working in a series of temporary positions, in 1964 Young was hired by Northern Illinois University to a tenure track position in the field of American history. He would continue to teach there for a quarter century before his retirement in 1989. His first book, The Democratic Republicans of New York: The Origins, 1763-1797, was published in 1967 and won accolades from the Institute of Early American History and Culture, which awarded it its Jamestown Prize. During the tumultuous era of the Vietnam war, Young emerged as an outspoken advocate of academic freedom and the defense of college professors with political views outside the mainstream from employment retaliation. He was the founder of the Committee on Academic Freedom in Illinois in 1968, an organization formed to halt the blacklisting of radical historian Staughton Lynd, and was active in the Committee on the Rights of Historians of the American Historical Association from its inception in 1971.Jesse Lemisch, \\"Remembering Al Young,\\" Labor and Working-Class History Association, Nov. 16, 2012. After his retirement from teaching, Young took a position as a Senior Scholar in Residence at the Newberry Library in Chicago.Chris Cantwell, \\"In Memorium: Al Young,\\" The Newberry, Nov. 14, 2012. Freed from the constraints of the classroom, Young managed to increase his literary productivity, releasing several essays collections and expanding his influential 1981 article on colonial shoemaker George Roberts Twelves Hewes into book form as The Shoemaker and the Tea Party: Memory and the American Revolution (1999). He also published an important biography of a seldom- remembered colonial woman who assumed a male gender identity in order to fight in the Revolutionary War, Masquerade: The Live and Times of Deborah Sampson, Continental Soldier (2005). In 2004, Young was a founding editor of the academic journal Labor: Studies in Working-Class History of the Americas, published today by Duke University Press.Leon Fink, \\"Remembering Al Young,\\" Labor and Working-Class History Association, Nov. 16, 2012. Death and legacy Al Young was stricken by his first heart attack in May 2012.Gregory Nobles, \\"In Memoriam: Alfred F. Young (1925-2012),\\" From the Square, New York University Press blog, Nov. 13, 2012. His productive work as a working historian was thereby brought to an end. Young died November 6, 2012, in Durham, North Carolina, following a second heart attack ‚Äî this time fatal. He was 87 years old at the time of his death. Young was remembered by his peers as a scholar of broad intellect with an exhaustive knowledge of his area of specialization. Historian Gregory Nobles, a collaborator with Young on a book project, recalled: \\"It‚Äôs hard to imagine anyone who knew the field better or cared more about really getting history right, especially about getting ordinary people ‚Äî and their politics ‚Äî into the picture.\\" Characterizing him as a \\"New Left historian before there was a New Left,\\" historian Michael D. Hattem declared that \\"Young‚Äôs greatest historiographical legacy may be his commitment to the idea that everyday people were historical actors, and the fact that that hardly seems revolutionary or revelatory is largely because of Al Young.\\" Works Books * The Democratic Republicans of New York: The Origins, 1763-1797.

He has travelled more than 40.000 km in polar territories. Ram√≥n Hernando de Larramendi One of his first milestones was the Circumpolar Expedition in the Arctic, during which he covered 14,000 km using only a dog sled and a kayak. This trip, in which he spent three years, laid the foundations for his later projects. In recent years, Larramendi has led a dozen expeditions in Antarctica and Greenland with his WindSled vehicle, whose ultimate goal is to be used for polar scientific research. Throughout his career, he has received several awards. Author of books on his experiences and on the Inuit people, he has also been a member of RTVE's 'Al filo de lo imposible' ('Edge of the Impossible') team. He is currently a member of the Board of Directors of the Spanish Geographic Society. He lives part of the year in southern Greenland.  The first years  In 1985, at the age of 19, Larramendi made the crossing of the Pyrenees on skis, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea, in 53 days, which he repeated in the following year on his own. Also in 1985, he was part of a pioneering group in Spain that crossed the interior of Iceland from west or east (Transislandia 85), also on skis, through its three largest glaciers. This feat allowed him to obtain his first public recognition: the Nescaf√© Prize 'Tu aventura vale un mill√≥n' ('Your adventure is worth a million'), in 1986, which let him finance his next adventure: the first Spanish voyage in the Greenland icecap: the TransGreenland Expedition, 700 km in 55 days. In 1988, he also led the first Circumnavigation of the Iberian Peninsula in kayak, sailing 3,500 kilometers in only 108 days. The following year, 1989, his adventurous spirit took him to the coast of Norway, which he travelled from north to south, another 2,500 kilometers, in kayak.  The Circumpolar Expedition  In 1990, Larramendi embarked on a great adventure: the Circumpolar Expedition. For three years, from February 12, 1990 to March 25, 1993, he travelled 14,000 km, from Greenland to Alaska, through the Northwest Passage, a trip in which he only used dog sledding and kayaking. This adventure was published in the international edition of National Geographic, which consecrated him as a explorer on an international level. In this Circumpolar Expedition he reached the North Geomagnetic Pole with 25 years, being thus the youngest explorer in obtaining it, and he had the opportunity to live with the Inuit, learning their language and their culture. Part of the tour he was accompanied by Manuel Olivera, Antonio Mart√≠nez and Rafael Peche.  Greenland  Before Circumpolar (1990-1993), Larramendi already knew Greenland. In 1986 he had been one of the protagonists of what would be the first Spanish expedition ever made to the polar ice cap: the Trans-Greenland Expedition, a route of 700 kilometers with skis that was carried out in 55 days. In 1999, he began designing a sled that is capable of moving wind-blown through polar lands thanks to large kites. In 2000, after a first test in Canada, he travelled back to Greenland to record a 600 km crossing for the TVE program 'Al filo de lo Imposible' with a first prototype of the vehicle. The following year, in 2001, he organized the Trans-Greenland Expedition 2001, 2,225 km of route in only 32 days using a new prototype of the WindSled, then baptized as 'polar catamaran'. On this journey, he broke the world record of distance travelled in just one day, and a North-South route on the Arctic island (Narsaq-Qaanaaq) was first opened. In 2002, he returned to Greenland for a new crossing in this vehicle: Greenland South-North, 2,300 kilometers in 33 days. He returned in 2003 for another expedition: Greenland East-West, in which they travelled 700 km in 18 days. In total, until August 2016, he made six expeditions with different designs of WindSled in Greenland. Of particular note is the one made in 2014, which was the first Circumnavigation of Greenland 2014 with a wind vehicle through the ice dome, with a total of 4,300 kilometers covered. Also noteworthy was the one that took place from May 15 to June 25, 2016, after reaching the Greenland ice summit, located at 3,240 m altitude, carrying 2,000 kilos of load on a 2,000 km route that took 38 days. In the last two expeditions, data were collected for scientific projects from different Spanish institutions, all related to climate change in the Arctic. Also, Larramendi collaborated with a project of the American glaciologist Jason Box. In addition to all these expeditions with the WindSled, Larramendi has carried out many other expeditions of shorter duration in the southern part of the ice cap and in the Thule region (northwest of Greenland), both with dog sledding and along the coast. During the years 1995 and 1996, the explorer spent two full winters in this region near the North Pole living and travelling with the Inuit. He has also accompanied mountain climber Jesus Calleja in his polar expeditions for different TVE programs.  The Antarctic   Transantarctic 2005-2006  In 2005, Larramendi travelled for the first time to the Antarctic, continent subject to an International Treaty, with his WindSled: The Transantarctic Expedition 2005-2006. It was the first crossing of history in this continent with a vehicle powered by renewable energies. He showed that, as in Greenland, it was possible to navigate the ice desert with a kite- driven vehicle. 'La Transant√°rtica 2005-2006', in which he was accompanied by Juan Manuel Viu and Ignacio Oficialdegui, achieved an important global geographic milestone: the three Spaniards were the first in history to reach, on December 14, 2005, the Pole of Inaccessibility of the Southern Hemisphere, the most difficult point of access of the Antarctic continent because it is the furthest from the ocean, according to the new coordinates of the British Antarctic Survey. These coordinates differ by 100 km from those considered 'classic', reached by the Russians in 1958. In total, they travelled 4,500 kilometers in 62 days.  South Pole Without Limits  In 2009, Larramendi led the expedition 'South Pole without limits', the first one to include people with disabilities. In 12 days of crossing with skis and sleds, the expeditioners reached the Geographic South Pole without the aid of animals or engines after having travelled 250 km.  Acciona Windpowered Antarctic Expedition  Six years later from his previous expedition with the Wind Sled, in winter 2011-2012, Larramendi led the Acciona Windpowered Antarctic Expedition. It was the first time someone reached the South Geographic Pole (making 2,200 km in 18 days) with a vehicle powered by wind energy. In total, 3,500 km were covered in 34 days. It was the first expedition of the explorer in which the vehicle was used for its original purpose: to explore and collect scientific samples for the French Institute of Glaciology and Geophysics of the CNRS-IJF in Grenoble, the Institute of Environmental Diagnosis and Water Quality of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in Barcelona, and the Limnopolar group of the Department of Biology of the Autonomous University of Madrid. This adventure was awarded by the Spanish Geographic Society in 2012, in the Enterprise category. Also participating in this expedition were Juan Pablo Albar, Javier Selva and Ignacio Oficialdegui.  Other expeditions to the Arctic   Geographic North Pole  Since 1998, he began to collaborate with RTVE's program 'Al filo de lo imposible', with whose team he made an expedition on skis in which they reached the Magnetic North Pole. With the same program, in 1999 he participated in the first and only Spanish expedition in history that has arrived to the Geographic North Pole. They travelled 1,000 kilometers with skis from Siberia in 60 days.  Projects   WindSled (Inuit WindSled)  The WindSled is a wind vehicle designed by Ram√≥n Hernando de Larramendi with the aim of becoming a useful mobile platform for researchers dedicated to the scientific exploration of the polar lands, of which it has already covered more than 18,000 km. It is a non-polluting means of transport powered by the strong polar winds, easy to carry and efficient in its performance. Its basic structure consists of several wooden platforms with crossbars and rails (following the model of the classic Inuit sleds), kites of different sizes and tents conceived as a space for habitability and work. Since its first design in 1999, continuous improvements have been made to it through the about ten expeditions already organized by the explorer. The energetic supply of the platform comes from the wind and the sun, with comets and photovoltaic plates feeding the equipment. The current model consists of four modules and it's configured as a convoy of 10 to 15 meters in length by three wide, with capacity for six people and a load of 2,000 kilos. The project aims at launching an international and / or national scientific program in which the WindSled vehicle will operate as a mobile laboratory that generates zero emissions in the fragile polar ecosystems. At the beginning, it was named 'Polar catamaran', later 'Antarctic Butterfly' and finally Wind Sled.  Inuit Climate Change Patrol  Ram√≥n H. Larramendi has launched a development project for the Thule region, in the northwest of Greenland, in which he combines his interest in preserving the traditional Inuit lifestyle with the research on the impact of climate change in this territory. The goal of the explorer is to help ensure that this threatened culture does not disappear.  Greenland Net Travel Agency  In 1997, the explorer founded the travel agency Greenland Net, a pioneer in organizing trips to the Polar Regions. It works in Spain, Italy and Greenland.

All contemporary forty-eight states took part, and state voters selected four voters to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Rapid recovery of the economy from a sharp recession following World War I transformed the 1920s into a strongly Republican decade. Even the problematic issue of a farm depression had eased by the time of the election as prices recovered.Roseboom, Eugene Holloway and Eckes, Alfred E.; A History of Presidential Elections, from George Washington to Jimmy Carter; pp. 151-158 It was also widely thought that the Teapot Dome scandal could do nothing to revive the Democrats as they were well known to have equally severe problems therewith via the fact that recently deceased Woodrow Wilson had paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in legal fees to nomination frontrunner William McAdoo.Yergin, Daniel; The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power; p. 198 Consequently, Utah voters strongly supported incumbent president Calvin Coolidge, who had come to power after Harding's death in 1923. As Harding had done four years earlier, Coolidge won all twenty-nine counties in Utah, a feat to be repeated by later Republican candidates in 1956, 1972, 1980, 1984, 2000, 2004 and 2012. The conservatism of Coolidge and Democratic nominee John W. Davis ‚Äì the only ever presidential nominee to win an electoral vote from West Virginia and the first from an antebellum slave state (including border states) since the Civil War‚ÄòWhat States do Presidents Come From?‚Äô ‚Äì led more liberal supporters of both parties to support Progressive Robert M. La Follette. Utah's conservative Mormonism meant that La Follette was not as popular as in other western states, and he finished third well behind Davis. La Follette nonetheless did outpoll Davis in the Wasatch Front counties of Salt Lake and Weber, as well as the eastern, ethnically more diverse Carbon County. For this election, Utah essentially voted as the nation did, with the state on a two-party basis coming out as 5.90 percent more Democratic than the nation at-large,Counting the Votes; Utah although the total Davis vote was within one percent of the national average, and the La Follette vote three percent higher than the country at-large, though lower than any state to the north or west. Utah was along with Arizona and New Mexico the only Mountain state where La Follette did not carry any county.

The 2017 Capcom Pro Tour followed several months after the \\"Season 2\\" update of Street Fighter V and started off with Final Round 20 on March 10. Much like the 2016 season, this season featured fifteen Premier Events, a few dozen smaller tournaments, several online tournaments, and the Evolution Championship. In these tournaments, competitors gained points needed to qualify for the 2017 Capcom Cup, which was held in December. Background Shortly after Capcom Cup 2016 was played, Capcom rolled out a major update for Street Fighter V titled \\"Season 2\\". Various characters were buffed or nerfed in the update: R. Mika and Chun Li were made weaker in the update, while Dhalsim got numerous buffs. Notably, \\"Dragon Punch\\" moves and light anti-air attacks were also made less useful. Infiltration criticized the update, saying that various characters were too harshly nerfed or too strongly buffed. In an interview with Core-A Gaming, Infiltration said that \\"It might be time to swallow your pride and just go with a top-tier [character].\\" In the months following the Season 2 update, the Street Fighter V metagame evolved strongly and characters such as Guile, Urien, Balrog, Laura, and Zangief rose in tier lists, despite not having been as viable in the 2016 Tour. In February 2017, Capcom announced that the prize pool of the Capcom Pro Tour would total $600,000 USD, $100,000 more than the year before. In total, 827 players scored points in the overall ranking.https://capcomprotour.com/standings/?circuit=2017&region;=global&pg;=16&list;_view=full‚ü®=en- us Point accumulation and Cup qualification Players can accumulate more points in Premier Event than in Ranking Events, and even more points at Evo 2017. The 30 players with the most points qualify for the 2017 Capcom Cup. In the 2015 and 2016 Capcom Pro Tours, players automatically qualified for the Capcom Cup if they won one of the fifteen Global Premier events. However, in a December 2016 interview, Capcom's Neidel \\"Haunts\\" Crisan suggested that the company might do away with this auto-qualification mechanic as players who win high-profile tournaments are likely to earn enough points to compete in the Capcom Cup either way. The qualification system of previous Capcom Pro Tours had been deemed confusing by fans, especially when more than one player wins several Premier Events. Similarly, the Global and Regional leaderboards used in previous Pro Tours were considered overly complex and Regional Events were abused by international players with higher travel budgets. Of the 32 players who will qualify for the 2017 Capcom Cup, 30 will have done so through garnering points by consistently placing highly in Pro Tour tournaments. Premier Events rewarded more points than smaller Ranking Events, and the Evo 2017 Street Fighter V tournament offers more points than any other tournament of the season. The 2017 Capcom Pro Tour saw an increase in online Ranking Events, with each region having four of such events. The Pro Tour was again split into four regions: North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Regional tournaments returned to the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, and qualification for these is based on points acquired exclusively in the applicable region. Only eight players can qualify per Regional tournament, one of which qualifies from a \\"last chance\\" tournament held the day before the tournament proper. One of the two auto-qualifications went to NuckleDu for winning the 2016 Capcom Cup. NuckleDu is still incentivised to compete in the Pro Tour because his seed in the Capcom Cup depends on his leaderboard placement. The other auto- qualification will be granted to the winner of the Capcom Cup Last Chance Qualifier, to be held the day before the Capcom Cup. Tour summary The Capcom Pro Tour kicked off on February 17, 2017, in an event that saw various professional Street Fighter players compete in show matches. This event took place in Folsom Street, San Francisco and featured show matches such as Filipino Champ vs Daigo Umehara, Justin Wong vs Snake Eyez, and a rematch between Capcom Cup 2016 finalists NuckleDu and Ricki Ortiz. The event was simultaneously the launch of Lupe Fiasco's album Drogas Light. The first tournament in the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour was Final Round 20, taking place on March 10-12 in Atlanta, Georgia. Competitors had roughly two months to familiarize themselves with the Season 2 changes to Street Fighter V before the first Premier Event. Final Round 20 was won by Kun Xian Ho, earning 400 points in the process. The second Premier Event and first European tournament of the 2017 Pro Tour, \\"Ultimate Fighting Arena\\", was held in the Stade Jean- Bouin in Paris on April 8-9. This tournament was won by Tatsuya Haitani after a nine-game win streak. The 2017 NorCal Regionals were held in Sacramento, California on April 14-16. This tournament was won by Victor \\"Punk\\" Woodley who defeated NuckleDu in the final game. Punk played mind games during this match, distracting NuckleDu on the character selection screen and teabagging NuckleDu's character whenever he went down. The Premier Event held on April 28-30 - DreamHack Austin - was also won by Punk, beating Kun Xian Ho in the finals. Punk spent little time taunting his opponent during this tournament compared to his behavior at NorCal Regionals. Reporting on DreamHack Austin, Damian Alonzo of ESPN noted that the character Ibuki was rising in prominence among professional Street Fighter players. The character was mostly unused in the 2016 season, but Xian, Fujimura \\"Yukadon\\" Atsushi, and Goichi \\"GO1\\" Kishida all have since started using the character. The fifth Premier Event of the 2017 Pro Tour was Battle Arena Melbourne 9, or BAM 9, held in the Melbourne Convention Centre on May 12-14. This tournament was won by Bonchan, using the character Nash to defeat all his opponents. On May 26-28, Combo Breaker 2017 was won by NuckleDu, defeating Snake Eyez in the finals despite losing to him earlier in the tournament. Punk wasn't able to compete in this tournament due to a schedule overlap with Eleague. Community Effort Orlando was won by Snake Eyez, defeating Punk in the finals. In August, Haitani won the 2017 Japan Cup, defeating Fuudo's R. Mika in the finals. Later that month, on August 25-28, Daigo Umehara won the Hong Kong Esports Festival; this constituted his first win in a Premier Event in nearly a year. In September, the SoCal Regionals were held. This tournament was dominated and won by Japanese player Atsushi \\"Yukadon\\" Fujimura. Capcom Cup The Capcom Cup concluding the 2017 Pro Tour was held in December. MenaRD from the Dominican Republic, won using Birdie. Downloadable content In April, Capcom announced that it would release new Capcom Pro Tour-themed downloadable content (DLC) for Street Fighter V, as they did in 2016 as well. 30% of the proceeds of Pro Tour-related DLC packs goes towards the overall prize pool of the tournaments, while 50% of the proceeds is invested in the production of the events. Ryu and Ken were declared to be the \\"featured fighters\\" of the 2017 season and fans could purchase alternative outfits for these two characters. Among the Pro Tour DLC packages is a \\"Premier Pass\\". Owners of such a pass receive monthly in-game objectives in which they can acquire in- game money. These DLC packages are only available for a limited time and the 2016 Pro Tour DLC was not re-released during the 2017 season.

King argues that the British Museum has a right to retain the marbles because they belong to the cultural heritage of many nations, Britain included, and because inferior facilities for their preservation in Greece would endanger their physical conservation if they were to be housed in Athens. The susceptibility of Athens to major earthquakes is among the specific threats she cites.Return the Marbles?

However, the fold of a protein is sensitive to environmental conditions, such as temperature and pH, and thus chaperones are needed to keep proteins in their functional fold across various environmental conditions. Chaperones are an integral part of a cell's protein quality control network by assisting in protein folding and are ubiquitous across diverse biological taxa. Since protein folding, and therefore protein function, is susceptible to environmental conditions, chaperones could represent an important cellular aspect of biodiversity and environmental tolerance by organisms living in hazardous conditions. Chaperones also affect the evolution of proteins in general, as many proteins fundamentally require chaperones to fold or are naturally prone to misfolding, and therefore mitigates protein aggregation. Evolution of chaperones The evolutionary development of chaperones is highly linked to the evolution of proteins in general, as their primary function is dependent on the presence of proteins. Proteins were selected as the main biological catalysts over ribozymes, RNA molecules capable of catalyzing biological reactions, early in cellular evolution. Diversity of monomers (4 nucleotides versus 20 amino acids), interactions during folding, and consequences of changes in sequence are some of the hypotheses that attempt to explain why proteins were selected over ribozymes. Small proteins fold spontaneously, but the development of increasingly larger proteins, which have more complex folding patterns and intramolecular interactions, would have required chaperones to prevent protein aggregation due to misfolding. Folding of early proteins would have been error-prone in ancient cell cytosol and chaperones would have been needed to assist in unfolding and re-folding. Heat shock proteins Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a diverse class of molecular chaperones that assist in folding under stress. While originally identified in heat stress response (hence the name ‚Äúheat shock‚Äù), inducible HSP expression is a consequence of all known stressors (pH, osmotic, temperature, energy depletion, ion concentration, etc.). Genetic stress, a result of deleterious mutations, also increases HSP expression. HSPs are ubiquitous across all domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) and have been found in every species for which they have been tested. HSPs are divided into families, based on sequence homology and molecular weight (hsp110, hsp100, hsp90, hsp70, hsp60, hsp40, hsp10, and small hsp families). Proteins are highly susceptible to denaturation due to environmental conditions and organisms that live in hazardous conditions should have a basal level of HSP expression. However, other adaptations, such as colonizing less hazardous microhabitats or other behavioral adaptations, could also contribute to acclimation in stressful habitats. Additionally, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù environments can also place stress on inhabitants (drought or seasonal changes, for example). These factors muddy the relationship between HSP expression and environmental stress resistance and HSP expression in nature is not well characterized. Elevated expression of heat shock proteins is not correlated with chronic environmental stress and is thought to be due to the costs of HSP expression. High levels of hsp70 are known to accompany deficits in cell division, reproduction, and reproductive success. Intracellularly, HSP expression shuts down normal cell functions and diverts a large amount of energy for stress resistance. Additionally, high levels of HSP is hypothesized to be toxic due to disruption of cell functions, possibly by excessive binding of client proteins. These results suggest that the costs of HSP expression are more suited to temporary stressors. Chaperone buffering Chaperones have also been implicated in the understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Protein folding in itself transitions from genotype to phenotype: primary structure/amino acid sequence reflects genotype while the final, functional fold, either tertiary or quaternary structure, represents phenotype. Since chaperones are mediators of this transition by assisting in the fold of the client protein, chaperone activity is thought to modulate the adaptive evolution of the proteome. One observation in line with this hypothesis is chaperone buffering, where the activity of a chaperone masks or ‚Äúbuffers‚Äù deleterious or destabilizing mutations in a client protein. In Drosophila melanogaster, reduced activity of hsp90 resulted in deficient phenotypes caused by mutations in developmental pathways. Hsp70 in Drosophila was also shown to buffer deleterious mutations. Similar results have been shown in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. Work in Escherichia coli showed that the GroES/GroEL system (aka hsp10 and hsp60 respectively) similarly buffered the effect of destabilizing mutations in a phosphotriesterase. The mutation disrupted the fold of the protein, but conferred an increase in efficiency upon chaperone-assisted folding. These results illustrate a model in which evolution can act on the phenotype of a protein while the deleterious effect of the genotype is mitigated by chaperones. Chaperones and the endosymbiosis theory Chaperones are ancient proteins that have been evolutionarily conserved across all domains of life and are ubiquitous across all biological taxa. Since they are so widespread and ancient, they can be used as molecular markers in studies of ancient cellular evolution. Phylogenetic analysis using two families of HSPs (hsp10 and hsp60, also called chaperonins) support the current endosymbiosis model of the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Hsp10 and hsp60 are present in all eubacteria and organelles of eukaryotes (mitochondria and chloroplasts), but not in eukaryotic cell cytosol and archaebacteria. Phylogenetic trees were generated using 56 total amino acid sequences from Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria; mitochondria from plants, animals, fungi, and protists; cyanobacteria; and chloroplasts. Any two hsp60 amino acid sequences share at least 40% similarity, with 18-20% of differences coming from conservative changes (uncharged amino acid to another uncharged amino acid). Any two hsp10 amino acid sequences share at least 30% similarity, with 15-20% conservative changes. Phylogenetic analysis using hsp10 and hsp60 yield similar results to that of rRNA and other genes. Mitochondria were found to be most closely related to the Œ±-purple subdivision of Gram negative bacteria and chloroplasts were most similar to cyanobacteria, similar to other data supporting the endosymbiosis theory. Gram positive bacteria were found to be the most ancestral, which is also supported by other studies.

It is found inside the old residence of the canons of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo and is accessible through the cloister of San Lorenzo. The cloister, built in the 12th century, is characterized by two levels of arches resting on double Romanesque columns with leaved capitals. In the 17th century two sides of the building were modified, with the double columns substituted with heavy pilasters in order to support the above two floors constructed for additional space. The museum houses objects from the diocese of Genoa and the surrounding area, including sculptures, paintings, frescoes, illuminated manuscripts, and a series of liturgical items, as well as an archeological area.  History  Fresco The museum was inaugurated on 16 December 2000, with its main entrance in the cloister. The building, erected on a Roman foundation between 1176 and 1184 as the residence of the canons of the cathedral and incorporating the old bishop's residence, is connected to the cloister by a passageway. The cloister was restored with funds from the Columbus Citizens Foundation, saving the old structure and adapting it for the museum.  Works  The museum offers the visitor a chance to learn more about the city through its archeological section as well as the works documenting the storia of the Genovese church.  The underground rooms  Funeral monument of Cardinal Luca Fieschi The visit begins underground where archeological finds from the region are displayed. The oldest items in the museum's collection are found here and include a comb made out of bone from the 4th-6th centuries, as well as a fragment from a Roman sacrophagus. Also found here is the funeral monument of Cardinal Luca Fieschi (c.1336) from the school of Giovanni di Balduccio of Pisa.  14th- and 15th-century painting  Ligurian painting of the 14th and 15th centuries is represented by works of great historical-artistic interest, including: * Polyptych of St Bartholomew (14th century), by Barnaba da Modena; * Polyptych of the Trinity, by an anonymous Genoan painter known as the Master of Santa Maria delle Vigne; * Fragment of a fresco (1468) from the Marini Chapel of the cathedral, by Cristoforo De' Mottis  16th-century painting  The evolution of the human figure in art, from the late Gothic to the Renaissance, is represented by a notable sequence of paintings from which stand out: * Polyptych of St Lazzaro (first half of the 16th century) by Pier Francesco Sacchi, from the church of St Lazzaro (now destroyed); * Dossal showing the Stories of St John the Baptist (first half of the 16th century), by Teramo Piaggio e Andrea Semino; * Piet√† with St John the Baptist and St Nicholas of Tolentino (first half of the 16th century) by Agostino Bombelli * Madonna with the Child Jesus enthroned and saints, attributed to Perin del Vaga; * Crucifixion by Luca Cambiaso.  16th century liturgical works  Among liturgical items of the 16th century are included: an antependium with an embroidered image of Grief over the dead Christ (c.1515) from Flanders. Metalworks include: a silver urn (embossed and etched, and partly gold- plated), made my Genovese silver and donated in 1615 to the church of St Siro da Placidia Doria; an embossed silver reliquary of the hand of St Stephen (12th century but with modifications from the 15th century); a series of washbasins (15th-16th centuries) in embossed brass, etched and with punching, of German manufacture.  Baroque art  The final section is dedicated to Baroque art; the commissions related to devotion play a key role both in the development of painting, and in the applied arts (textiles, jewelry, wooden sculptures, etc.). These include: the Madonna of Loreto by Domenico Fiasella; the transitus of St Scholastica and Tobias buries the dead, both by Gregorio de Ferrari.

This phenomenon can apply to both plant and animal taxa. The idea was originally presented in 2005 by Stephen Hubbell, a plant ecologist at the University of Georgia. This idea has led to a new paradigm for species-level classification ‚Äì organizing species into groups based on functional similarity rather than morphological or evolutionary history. In the natural world, several examples of functional equivalence among different taxa have emerged analogously.  Plant-pollinator relationships  One example of functional equivalence is demonstrated in plant-pollinator relationships, whereby a certain plant species may evolve flower morphology that selects for pollination by a host of taxonomically- unrelated species to provide the same function (fruit production following pollination). For example, the herbaceous plant spiny madwort (Hermathophylla spinosa) grows flowers that are shaped so that taxonomically unrelated pollinators behave almost identically during pollination. From the plant's perspective, each of these pollinators are functionally equivalent and thus are not subjected to specific selective pressures Variation in the shape and structure of both flower and seed morphology can be a source of selective pressure for animal species to evolve a variety of morphological features, yet also provide the same function to the plant.  Plant-animal seed dispersal mechanisms  Plant-animal interactions in terms of seed dispersal are another example of functional equivalence. Evidence has shown that, over the course of millions of years, most plants have maintained evolutionary trait stability in terms of the size and shape of their fruits. However, the animal species that consume and disperse the seeds within the fruits have evolved physically at a faster rate than the plants they feed off of. In other words, animal species have been changing and evolving more than the plants have been changing their seed and fruit morphology. Functional equivalence of the animal species consuming and dispersing the seeds can account for the ability for these plants to continue to survive without genetic changes to their fruit/seed morphology. As with the Hormathophylla example above, the plant species are not subjected to selective pressures the same way that animals are.  Metabolite production  Another instance is the analogous evolution of plant metabolite production as a response to herbivory. In this case, different plant species have evolved different mechanisms of chemical repellant to herbivores, yet each response provides the same function ‚Äì resistance to herbivory. In some cases, plants living in completely different environments (geographic separation) and that are not taxonomically related can evolve different metabolites that provide the same function to the plant - protection against herbivory. This is another example of functional equivalency among taxonomically unrelated species.  Symbiotic relationships  Numerous instances of functional equivalence may exist within microbial symbionts and their associated host. Some examples of these include the large diversity of microbes within termite digestive tracts and the human gut microbiome. In these environments, a vast array of taxonomically diverse organisms provide the function of food digestion and cellulose breakdown. These microbial organisms most likely evolved under similar conditions but at different points in time, and they have now been discovered interacting with one another and providing the same function to their host organism.  Functional equivalency and biodiversity  Recently, biologists have used the idea of functional equivalency, sometimes referred to as functional redundancy, to make predictions about how to best manage ecosystems and their microcosms. It is a common misconception that high degrees of taxonomic diversity within an ecosystem will ultimately result in a healthier, highly functional system. For example, an ecological microcosm consisting of 30 species of legume plants (which add fixed nitrogen to the soil) is only fulfilling one ecosystem function (nitrogen fixation) despite being rich taxonomically. On the other hand, an ecosystem containing low taxonomic diversity but high functional diversity may be more sustainable. Recent studies have argued that an ecosystem can maintain optimum health by having each ecosystem functional group represented by many taxonomically unrelated species (functional equivalency). In other words, an ecosystem can potentially be at its highest level of integrity if it is both functionally rich and taxonomially rich.  Skepticism  Some biologists have questioned the importance of the functional equivalence theory. For example, Loreau points out that, in actual testing of functional equivalency, it is hard to draw concise conclusions as to whether or not the theory is sound due to the complexity and oversimplification of the theory itself. For example, many studies testing the effects of species loss and functional redundancy rarely address the ambiguity of whether or not functionality is acting at the individual or population level and the possibility for multiple niche dimensions to be overlapping with one another. Ultimately, the hypothesis of functional equivalence is one that is well recognized among systems ecologists and evolutionary biologists and is an active area of modern research to determine quantitative examples. However, further research is needed in order to quantify the effects of species loss on ecosystem function in order to provide more evidence to support the hypothesis of functional equivalence.

From top to bottom: * Cospeciation: host and parasite speciate concurrently * Host switching: speciation as parasite switches hosts and evolves in reproductive isolation * Independent speciation: parasite speciates on same host, reasons unrelated to host * Extinction: parasite goes extinct on host * Missing the boat: host speciates but parasite does not end up reproductively isolated Cospeciation is a form of coevolution in which the speciation of one species dictates speciation of another species and is most commonly studied in host-parasite relationships. In the case of a host-parasite relationship, if two hosts of the same species get within close proximity of each other, parasites of the same species from each host are able to move between individuals and mate with the parasites on the other host. However, if a speciation event occurs in the host species, the parasites will no longer be able to \\"cross over\\" because the two new host species no longer mate and, if the speciation event is due to a geographic separation, it is very unlikely the two hosts will interact at all with each other. The lack of proximity between the hosts ultimately prevents the populations of parasites from interacting and mating. This can ultimately lead to speciation within the parasite. According to Fahrenholz's rule, first proposed by Heinrich Fahrenholz in 1913, when host-parasite cospeciation has occurred, the phylogenies of the host and parasite come to mirror each other. In host-parasite phylogenies, and all species phylogenies for that matter, perfect mirroring is rare. Host-parasite phylogenies can be altered by host switching, extinction, independent speciation, and other ecological events, making cospeciation harder to detect. However, cospeciation is not limited to parasitism, but has been documented in symbiotic relationships like those of gut microbes in primates.  Fahrenholz's rule  In 1913, Heinrich Fahrenholz proposed that the phylogenies of both the host and parasite will eventually become congruent, or mirror each other when cospeciation occurs. More specifically, more closely related parasite species will be found on closely related species of host. Thus, to determine if cospeciation has occurred within a host-parasite relationship, scientists have used comparative analyses on the host and parasite phylogenies. In 1968, Daniel Janzen proposed an opposing theory to Fahrenholz's rule. Studying cospeciation within plant-insect relationships, he proposed that species have a physiological range of conditions and environments. Over time, conserved traits within a parasitic species allows for survival in a range of conditions or environments. \\"Ecological fitting\\", as it is known, means more closely related parasites will share similar traits that pertain to surviving on a particular host. This provides explanation for the congruence of the host-parasite phylogenies.  Parasitic cospeciation  Fahrenholz's rule appears to be observed in the parasitic cospeciation of pocket gophers and chewing lice. It is seen, too, between Poaceae grasses and Anguininae nematodes, and between some plants and Phyllonorycter leaf-mining moths.  Symbiotic cospeciation  Black smokers provide energy and nutrients to chemoautotrophic bacteria, which in turn have symbiotically cospeciated with deep sea clams. Among animals, symbiotic cospeciation is seen between Uroleucon (aphids) and Buchnera (plants in the Orobanchaceae), between deep sea clams and chemoautotrophic bacteria, and between Dendroctonus bark beetles and certain fungi.Bracewell, Ryan Russell, \\"Coevolution and cospeciation in a bark-beetle fungal symbiosis\\" (2015). Theses, Dissertations, and Professional Papers. Paper 10781 Symbiotic cospeciation is found between Crematogaster ants and Macaranga plants, between Ficus fig trees and chalcid wasps, and between the Poaceae grasses and Epichloe fungi.  False incongruence  The two main hurdles to determining cospeciation using Fahrenholz's rule are instances of false congruence and false incongruence. False congruence occurs when parasite and host phylogenies mirror each other but not due to cospeciation, for instance, if the parasites were to colonize the hosts after the host species had diverged and congruent phylogenies resulted by chance, but this is unlikely. False incongruence, when cospeciation has occurred, but the phylogenies do not mirror each other, is more common, and can be caused by a number of factors; it might also appear to be present if parasites that are present on a host are not detected by the experimenter.  Host switching  Though parasites have been thought to be specialized to a certain host species, it is common for a parasite to colonize a different host that was not previous colonized by the parasite species. If a \\"host switch\\" occurs after a cospeciation event, the presence of the parasite on other host species will disrupt any potential congruence in the two phylogenies. Coupled with extinction or independent speciation, phylogenetic comparisons can become complicated and entirely mask the cospeciation event.  Independent speciation  Typically independent speciation does not significantly alter the phylogenetic analysis used to measure cospeciation. However, in combination with extinction, independent speciation can become very problematic when trying to sort out host and parasite phylogenies. Independent speciation occurs when a single population on a single host undergoes speciation resulting in two sister lineages of parasite on a particular host. In other words, the parasite lineage speciates while the host lineage does not. This becomes complicated when the two lineages of parasites then undergo cospeciation with the host. If one of the two parasite lineages goes extinct from the new host lineage, the phylogenies of the host and parasite will begin to break apart. Even though the parasite and host cospeciated together, the phylogenies will not be congruent.  Extinction  After cospeciation, it is possible for a parasite (or symbiont) to become extinct while its host survives. This can happen if, for example, the host species adapts to a new habitat..  \\"Missing the boat\\"  Prior to speciation of the hosts, if the distribution of the parasite population among the host population is sporadic, it is possible that when host speciation occurs, it will occur with hosts that do not have the parasite population. This phenomenon is known as \\"missing the boat\\". The parasites could potentially cospeciate with their host down the line, however, the parasites could potentially be absent from some host lineages. Like extinction and independent speciation, \\"missing the boat\\" alone will probably have a minimal effect on mapping phylogenies, however, in conjunction with independent speciation, parasite and host phylogenies can begin to break apart.

These populations may be separated by space and/or time. Depending on the ecological conditions, the interspecific interactions may be mutualistic, antagonistic or even an arms race showing variation in specific traits over a broad geographical area.Thompson, John N. \\"Coevolution: The Geographic Mosaic of Coevolutionary Arms Races.\\" Current Biology 15.24 (2005): R992-994. Cell.com. Elsevier. Web. In mutualisms, both partners benefit from the interaction. When both partners experience a decreased fitness, it is an antagonistic relationship. Arms races consist of two species adapting ways to \\"one up\\" the other. Several factors affect these relationships, including hot spots, cold spots, and trait mixing.Gomulkiewicz, Richard et al. \\"Hot Spots, Cold Spots, and the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution.,\\" The American Naturalist 156, no. 2 (August 2000): 156-174. Reciprocal selection occurs when a change in one partner puts pressure on the other partner to change in response. Hot spots are areas of strong reciprocal selection, while cold spots are areas with no reciprocal selection or where only one partner is present. The three constituents of geographic structure that contribute to this particular type of coevolution are: natural selection in the form of a geographic mosaic, hot spots often surrounded by cold spots, and trait remixing by means of genetic drift and gene flow. Mosaic, along with general coevolution, most commonly occurs at the population level and is driven by both the biotic and the abiotic environment. These environmental factors can constrain coevolution and affect how far it can escalate.Anderson, Bruce, and Steven D. Johnson. \\"The geographical mosaic of coevolution in a plant‚Äìpollinator mutualism.\\" Evolution 62.1 (2008): 220-225. The geographical mosaic theory was first described by Ehrlich and Raven in 1964 after studying butterflies that coevolve with plants. However, the idea of coevolution itself goes all the way back to Darwin.  Examples   Mutualisms  A commonly used example of mutualism in mosaic coevolution is that of the plant and pollinator. Anderson and Johnson studied the relationship between the length of the proboscis of the long-tongued fly (P. ganglbaueri) and the corolla tube length of Zaluzianskya microsiphon, a flowering plant endemic to South Africa.Arnold T.H., de Wet B.C. (Eds), Plants of Southern Africa: Names & Distribution, MEMOIRS OF THE BOTANICAL SURVEY OF SOUTH AFRICA No. 62, Pub.National Botanical Institute, South Africa.1993 They suspected, as Darwin did in 1862, that flowers would adapt to become longer in order to force the fly to insert more of its body into the flower in order to reach the nectar. This causes the fly's body to come in contact with the flower's pollen. The two characteristics were measured at several different geographic locations and it was found that the length of the fly's proboscis caused strong selective pressures on the length of the corolla of the flower. An increase in proboscis length was selected for, when flowers were longer because it is their primary food source.  Coevolutionary arms races  Mosaic coevolution can cause an arms race between the two interacting species. Interspecies relationships that typically result in arms races are host- parasite and predator-prey interactions. In the case of predator-prey coevolution, predators are relentlessly attempting to catch the prey species and mutations that increase the number of successful hunts will be selected for. Similarly, animals of prey are consistently adapting ways to evade predation, and so the arms race continues. The plant species Camellia japonica (the Japanese camellia) and its seed predator Curculio camelliae (the camellia weevil) are an example of a coevolutionary arms race. The length of the weevil's rostrum and the thickness of the fruit's pericarp are correlated, meaning that a change in one character prompts a change in the other. The weevil will use its rostrum to burrow into the center of the camellia fruit seeking a place to lay eggs, as the weevil larva feed exclusively on the camellia seeds. This is a main cause of seed damage in the Japanese camellia and, in order to better protect its seeds, the plant will evolve to grow a thicker pericarp.Toju, Hirokazu, and Teiji Sota. \\"Imbalance of predator and prey armament: geographic clines in phenotypic interface and natural selection.\\" The American Naturalist 167.1 (2005): 105-117. In some areas, the pericarp of these fruits was found to be remarkably woody. The pericarp thickness of the camellia fruit was observed to be thicker in more southern locations than in the north. The areas of Hanyama and Yahazu, Japan are just under nine miles away from each other, but there was an 8 mm difference in pericarp thickness in the camellia populations sampled there. The length of the weevil's rostrum was found to be 5mm longer in the area with thicker fruit. This shows that the survival of the Japanese camellia seeds in the south is dependent upon the thick pericarp as a form of protection. However, northern areas were found to have fruit with infested seeds regardless of thickness of the pericarp. This suggests that the plants in the north were more susceptible to weevil attacks and the two traits are not as strongly correlated as they were in southern areas.

The two populations live in different environments that affect growth differently due to many ecological factors, such as the temperature and available food. One population is genetically predisposed to have an increased growth rate but inhabits an environment that reduces growth rate, such as a cool environment, and thereby limits the opportunities to take full advantage of any genetic predisposition. The second population is genetically predisposed to have a decreased growth rate but inhabits an environment that supports an increased growth rate, such as a warm environment, and allows members of the population to grow faster despite their genetic disadvantage. Since the genetic influence directly counteracts the environmental influence in each population, both populations will have a similar intermediate growth rate. Countergradient variation can reduce apparent variability by creating similar phenotypes, but it is still possible for the two populations to show phenotypic diversity if either the genetic gradient or the environmental gradient has a stronger influence. Many examples of countergradient variation have been discovered through the use of transplant experiments. Countergradient variation of growth rate is one of the most common examples. Growth rate and body size have important ecological implications, such as how they impact an organism's survival, life history, and fecundity. Countergradient variation has been described in many ectothermic animals, since ectotherms rely on environmental temperature to regulate their metabolic rates, and thus, their growth rates. Ectotherms grow at a slower rate as latitude increases due to this impact of temperature. However, under countergradient variation, when these same animals are placed in a common environment with their low-latitude relatives, they grow faster relative to the low-latitude population. These studies are useful in predicting how animals can adapt to and will survive in different environmental conditions. History Green frog Lithobates clamitans unexpectedly grows faster in montane populations Countergradient variation, originally termed \\"contra-gradient variation\\", was coined by Richard Levins in his 1968 book Evolution in Changing Environments. Levins first used the term when describing patterns of body size across an altitudinal gradient in populations of Drosophila, and since then many other instances of countergradient variation have been discovered. A study by Keith Berven and others was the first to find countergradient variation in a vertebrate. Specifically, they found that in comparing montane, high altitude, populations to lowland, low altitude populations of the green frog (Lithobates clamitans, formerly Rana clamitans), rates of growth and development were higher in the montane populations. This is counter to what is expected since high altitude populations grow slower than low altitude ones in their respective environments. Similar to the results of this study, most of the known instances of countergradient variation are associated with a latitudinal or altitudinal gradient having an effect on growth rate (see Examples section). Examples The following are among the discovered cases of countergradient variation. The species name is followed by the trait affected and the environmental gradient studied. Animals * Drosophila melanogaster ‚Äì body size; altitude * Menidia menidia ‚Äì growth; latitude * Lithobates clamitans ‚Äì developmental rate; altitude * Lithobates sylvatica ‚Äì growth; latitude and altitude * Sceloporus undulatus ‚Äì growth; latitude Plants * Laminaria saccharina ‚Äì growth; latitude * Carex aquatilis ‚Äì shoot height; temperature and latitude * Spartina angilca ‚Äì growth and survival; tide elevation and succession stage Mechanisms Countergradient variation is the opposite of cogradient variation, in which the environmental effect on the phenotype enhances the genetic effect on the phenotype. One common way to test for both of these patterns is with transplant experiments. By bringing the two populations to the same environment, the environmental effect on phenotype is eliminated and only the genetic effect will cause variation. If cogradient variation is occurring, the same relationship will be seen in the common environment as the two natural environments. However, if countergradient variation is occurring the opposite relationship of what is seen in the natural environments will be seen in the common environment. For example, if Population 1 has higher growth than Population 2 in their respective natural environments, countergradient variation can be detected if, when brought to the same environment, Population 1 now has lower growth than Population 2. Many of the examples listed above were discovered through these types of experiments. However, the mechanisms of how these differential growth rates arise is not fully understood. Take the example of Sceloporus undulatus, the eastern fence lizard. These lizards demonstrate countergradient variation in growth rate across a latitudinal gradient. That is, in a common environment eggs from populations from the northern part of their range hatch out sooner than the eggs from populations at a more southern range. This is opposite the pattern seen in their native habitats. One explanation for this could be that the northern eggs are also naturally larger, so they have more yolk energy available. Originally this maternal investment in larger eggs was thought to support increased developmental rate. However when yolk is removed from the eggs so that the populations have equal energy sources, there is still a substantial difference in growth. Therefore, the mechanism behind this differential growth rate may lie in the efficiency of energy use. Ecological relevance Populations that inhabit high latitudes experience shorter growing seasons than those that inhabit low latitudes due to the differences in seasonality. Because of this, it is thought that countergradient variation of growth is a means to compensate for the short amount of time juveniles have to prepare for winter. With a genetic disposition to grow faster, these individuals can reach a large enough body size to survive through the winter. Increased body size is also associated with higher reproductive output. Additionally, when countergradient variation acts on developmental rates, embryos that develop sooner or hatch out larger will have more time to grow or require less resources, respectively. Since these inherently fast growth rates are not observed in all populations, it seems there are potential trade-offs that would prevent this from being beneficial in low latitude populations. One proposed detriment of enhanced embryonic growth is that animals use too much of their supplied nutrients or yolk during development. In some species of lizards the yolk remaining after hatching is absorbed into the body and used as energy for growth as a hatchling. The use of more yolk energy during development diminishes the reserves available for hatchling growth and can impact hatchling survival. Another hypothesis is that animals that grow quickly do not expend as much energy on differentiation or cellular maintenance because they have shorter incubation times. This allows more energy to be used for growth, but less energy for differentiation. Increased growth has been shown to lead to higher occurrences of defects or complications that cause higher rates of mortality. Some examples include rapid growth leading to bone deformities in sandhill cranes and increased risk of cardiovascular problems in Atlantic salmon. Animals are able to employ different strategies for growth and development to counteract environmental challenges. However, the fact that all individuals do not grow faster and the presence of the mentioned potential fitness trade-offs show that there must be some limit to how much animals can use countergradient growth to compensate for environmental conditions that cause slow growth. Studies of countergradient variation are being explored as a useful way to predict the evolutionary constraints animals face in differing environmental conditions.

It protects an area of rugged mountains with a large remnant of Atlantic Forest that is home to various endangered species. Location The Desengano State Park has an area of divided between the municipalities of Santa Maria Madalena, S√£o Fid√©lis and Campos dos Goytacazes in the north of the state of Rio de Janeiro. Elevations range from . The rugged terrain includes ridges, pointed peaks, sugar loaf mountains and scarps with slopes of up to 75 degrees. Peaks include the Pico do Desengano , Pico S√£o Mateus and Pedra Agulha . The park contains the sources of many water courses that supply settlements in the region. Waterfalls include the Vernec, Bonita and Tromba d‚Äô√Ågua. The main rivers are the Rio Grande and its tributaries the Macap√° and Sant√≠ssimo streams, the Col√©gio River, and the Segundo do Norte, Morumbeca, Aleluia and Mocot√≥ rivers, tributaries of the Imb√© River which feeds the Lagoa de Cima (Cima Lake). From that lake the Urura√≠ River flows to the Lagoa Feia. History The Desengano State Park is the oldest conservation unit in Rio de Janeiro, created on 13 April 1970 by decree-law 250. State decree 7.121 of 28 December 28, 1983, republished in the Official Gazette of the State of Rio de Janeiro on 18 January 1984, established an environmental protection area that contained the area of Desengano State Park. The park is managed by the State Environmental Institute (Inea). The park managers try to curb hunting and deforestation in the park and its surroundings. In June 2015 they seized 35 birds and a shotgun in the town of Monte Caf√©. In October 2015 they found evidence of illegal logging in the town of Agulha do Imb√©, in the municipality of Santa Maria Madalena, and charged the owner of the land with environmental crime. Environment The Desengano State Park has great scenic beauty, with many rocky peaks and flora representative of the original Atlantic Forest biome. It holds the last continuous remnant of Atlantic Forest in the region. Vegetation includes dense submontane rainforest at altitudes from , dense montane rainforest from and alpine meadows above . About 410 species of birds have been found in the region. 283 species of birds are found in the well- preserved alpine meadows, of which 22 are endemic and have low populations. Endangered bird species include black-fronted piping guan (Pipile jacutinga) , solitary tinamou (Tinamus solitarius), white-necked hawk (Buteogallus lacernulatus) and black-and-white hawk-eagle (Spizaetus melanoleucus). The Penelope, Tinamou, neotropical bellbird, black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus) and red-browed amazon (Amazona rhodocorytha) are now only found in protected areas. Mammals include maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus), cougar (Puma concolor), coati, lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), howler monkeys, nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), tayra (Eira barbara), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), titis, brown four-eyed opossum (Metachirus nudicaudatus), Robust capuchin monkeys, fur√£o (Mustelidae species) and crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus). In July 1999 the highly endangered muriqui was observed, causing great interest in the national and international scientific community and stimulating investment in research and conservation activities.

Price was an American engineer and inventor. He made substantial contributions to several US aircraft projects during the first half of the twentieth century.  Pressurized cabin  Before World War II, American airplane manufacturer Boeing had responded to a government solicitation for a large strategic bomber. Its proposal, the B-17 Flying Fortress, was considered \\"too big\\" by some members of Congress when additional financing was requested for the project. Fearing the project would be canceled and hoping to salvage something from the design effort, Boeing President Claire Egtvedt, who was aware that fledgling airline companies Trans World Airlines and Pan American World Airways were seeking the ability to operate their airliners above most of the frequent low-level turbulence on their routes, proposed that those airlines underwrite the cost of creating a pressurized airliner from components of the B-17. The Model 307 airliner would utilize the B-17's wings and tail. The airliner's four Curtiss Wright R-1820 radial engines used crankshaft-driven two-speed superchargers both for added power and for greater performance at altitude. To provide pressurized air for the proposed cabin, the two inboard engines also drove (via a shaft) an additional supercharger mounted on each engine's firewall. Dr. W. Randy Lovelace of the Mayo Clinic, was consulted; he advised that cabin pressurization begin at 8,000 feet MSL. Then pressurized air would be added as required to maintain an 8,000-foot cabin pressure. Above 16,000 feet MSL, cabin pressure would again decrease, due to the limited rating of the superchargers. The plane was expected to have a maximum cruise altitude of 20,000 to 22,000 feet MSL. Price's cabin pressure regulator was the heart of the pressurization system. Its inlet valve regulated the flow of ventilating air to the cabin; its discharge valve opened as directed to maintain the required pressure. The valves' operations were controlled by a \\"black box\\", a maze of valves, venturis, and pleated metal bellows. Incoming air was drawn through slits on the wing leading edge; discharged air exited below the empennage. Price received a United States patent for his work. After the prototype was working correctly, a contract was given to Garrett AiResearch in California to manufacture the components.D'Alto, Nick. Above It All - Air&Space; Smithsonian, September 2009  P-38 supercharger  In 1937 the Lockheed Company responded to a government proposal for an advanced fighter with a two-engine design of unusual configuration. Designers opted to incorporate the Allison V-1710 engine, which used a single-stage supercharger. This severely limited its performance at higher altitudes, so Lockheed added exhaust-driven superchargers, which solved the altitude problem. The GE-supplied turbochargers were upgraded in 1941 for higher-altitude missions, so Lockheed contracted with Price to analyze the installation and provide improvements. He is credited with the system's success after that time.Planes That Never Flew - America's First Jet Fighter, Alba Communications/Southern Star Sales (2003)  Axial-flow jet engine  In 1930, Nathan Price joined Doble Steam Motors, a manufacturer of steam engines for cars and other uses. In 1933 he began working on a steam turbine for aircraft use. The engine featured a centrifugal compressor that fed air to a combustion chamber, which in turn fed steam into a turbine before exiting through a nozzle, powering the compressor and a propeller. The engine was fitted to a test aircraft in early 1934, where it demonstrated performance on par with existing piston engines, except for difficulty maintaining power at higher altitudes due to the compressor. Work on the design ended in 1936 after Doble found little interest in the design from aircraft manufacturers or the Army. Price started work on his own turbojet design in 1938. To improve fuel efficiency, he used a combination of low-compression axial compressor stages feeding a high-compression reciprocating compressor. In 1941 he was hired by Lockheed to evaluate the General Electric superchargers being fit to the experimental XP-49, a high-altitude version of the P-38. Price had the basic design of his jet completed and was able to attract the interest of Chief Research Engineer Kelly Johnson. Johnson had been thinking about a new high- speed design after running into various compressibility problems with the P-38 and the jet engine appeared to solve some of the problems. During 1941 he ordered the development of a new aircraft to be powered by Price's engine, developing the engine as the L-1000 and the aircraft as the L-133.Kay, Antony. Turbojet: History and Development 1930-1960. Vol, 2. The Crowwood Press, 2007. Norton, Bill. U.S. Experimental & Prototype Aircraft Projects: Fighters 1939-1945. North Branch, Minnesota: Specialty Press, 2008, pp. 80‚Äì85. An L-1000 at the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California The proposed engine was not officially accepted, because at that time the United States government was informed of British work on jet engines. However, Price was encouraged by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) officials at Wright Field to refine his design. His redesign incorporated two sixteen-stage axial compressors with a single stage of intercooling. The first four stages of the forward compressor remained clutched to allow them to operate at optimum speed. The turbine was reduced to four stages. The low-pressure compressor was encased in a two-part cylindrical casing with stiffening ribs, which gave it an odd appearance similar to the bottom of an egg carton. The shorter high- pressure compressor was similarly encased, but with ribs running front-to-back only. Power was taken off between the two compressor stages to power accessories, with the gearbox placed on the top of the engine outside of the compressor casings. In June 1943 the USAAF did give Lockheed a contract for a jet-powered airplane, but it was to incorporate a British turbojet. Thereafter, Price discontinued work on his design. The sole example of his engine is displayed at Planes of Fame Air Museum, in Chino, California.

Founded in the late 19th century by the educationalist Dinanath Bezbaruah, it is one of the oldest secondary schools in the state. based in Assam. Asamiya is the medium of instruction.  Overview  The Govt. Bezbaruah Higher Secondary School has classes from grades 6 to 12. The administration of the school is headed by the Principal. It is affiliated to SEBA (HSLC) until grade 10 and AHSEC (HSSLC) after grade 10 until grade 12.  Background  Right side view of the Golaghat Govt. School campus from the entrance gate. The Indian Education Commission's (1882) recommendation for expansion of secondary education through the agency of private enterprise resulted in the establishment of some institutions by philanthropists. Gobinda Bezbaruah, an educationist, established one High School each at Golaghat, Jorhat and Sivasagar. As a part of technical education, a system of industrial apprenticeship was introduced initially from the Williamson Trust Fund. George Williamson (Senior) of Golaghat, renowned tea planter bequeathed an amount of ‚Çπ1lack in his will that amounted to ¬£10,000 at that time \\"for educational purposes combined with, schools of industry and art of the province\\" and \\"in the establishment of small libraries\\" both in English and Vernacular languages at the schools. To suggest the best means of utilizing the bequest, the Chief Commissioner held a meeting on 15 August 1887 where it was unanimously resolved that an amount of ‚Çπ7,000 be set apart for public libraries and another amount of ‚Çπ14,000 be appropriated or the establishment of two schools at Golaghat and Jorhat to be named Williamson schools.AS Proceedings Home A, 1902 January Nos 124-127, Notes J. Donald 10 Dec 1901 The wave of evolving education institutions propagated the idea to establish a premier school in Golaghat that would not only contribute to the development of its citizens, but would also play a role to enrich the regional language, Asamiya. The educationalist Dinanath Bezbaruah and his team then took the project for establishing a senior secondary school, and finally in the year 1886, the Bezbarauah Higher Secondary School was founded in Golaghat.

Many of the district's buildings were designed by Lambert Packard, a prominent local architect. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and was enlarged slightly in 1976. It was subsumed into the larger St. Johnsbury Historic District in 1980. with Description and history The town of St. Johnsbury was settled in the late 18th century, and was at first organized primarily on a high terrace above the Passumpsic River, where its Main Street is now located. This area developed as a residential and civic hub, with some commercial development, in the first half of the 19th century. The arrival of railroad lines in the 19th century prompted major development in the \\"lower district\\", now Railroad Street, as a commercial center organized around the railroads. The Main Street area retained its civic importance, and is where the town hall and the county facilities of Caledonia County are located. with The historic district extends along Main Street, from Mt. Pleasant Street in the north to Vine Street in the south. It includes a small residential area bounded by Vine, Main, and Barker Streets and Western Avenue, and also on Prospect Street. The northern end of the district is anchored by a small triangular park, and is predominantly residential. South of Winter Street there are a cluster mainly religious buildings, including the Fairbanks Museum and Observatory. At the junctions with Western and Eastern Avenues (signed United States Route 2) there are a few commercial buildings, the town hall and county courthouse, and the St. Johnsbury Atheneum, built in 1875 and one of the nation's oldest unaltered museums. South of the Western Avenue junction, where there is also a small triangular park with a Victorian fountain, is a small residential area characterized by high-quality large-scale homes, including some built by members of the locally prominent Fairbanks family, owners of the Fairbanks Scale Works, the town's largest employer in the late 19th century.

A simple diagram of Synchronverter operation environment Synchronverters or virtual synchronous generatorsFang Gao, M. Reza Iravani. ‚ÄúA control strategy for a distributed generation unit in grid-connected and autonomous modes of operation‚Äù, IEEE Transactions on power delivery, volume 23, pp. 850-859, (2008)Yong Chen, Ralf Hesse, Dirk Turschner, et al. ‚ÄúImprovingthe gr id power quality using virtual synchronous machines‚Äù, Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Power Engineering, Energy and Electrical Drives, pp. 1 -6, (2011). are inverters which mimic synchronous generators to provide \\"synthetic inertia\\" for ancillary services in electric power systems. Inertia is a property of standard synchronous generators associated with the rotating physical mass of the system spinning at a frequency proportional to the electricity being generated. Inertia has implications towards grid stability as work is required to alter the kinetic energy of the spinning physical mass and therefore opposes changes in grid frequency. Inverter based generation inherently lacks this property as the waveform is being created artificially via power electronics.  Background  Standard inverters are very low inertia elements. During transient periods, which are mostly because of faults or sudden changes in load, they follow changes rapidly and may cause a worse condition, but synchronous generators have a notable inertia that can maintain their stability. The grid is designed to operate at a specific frequency. When electric power supply and demand is perfectly balanced the grid frequency will remain at its nominal frequency. However, any imbalance in supply and demand will lead to a deviation from this nominal frequency. It is standard for electricity generation and demand to not be perfectly balanced, however the imbalance is tightly controlled such that the grid frequency remains within a small band of +/- 0.05 Hz. A synchronous generator‚Äôs rotating mass acts as a sort of bank of kinetic energy for the grid to counteract changes in frequency - it can either provide or absorb power from the grid - caused by an imbalance of electric power supply and demand - in the form of kinetic energy by speeding up or slowing down. The change in kinetic energy is proportional to the change in frequency. Because it takes work to speed up or slow down rotating mass, this inertia dampens the effects of active power imbalances and therefore frequency. Because inverter- based generation inherently lacks inertia, increasing penetration of inverter- based renewable energy generation could endanger power system reliability. Further, the variability of renewable energy sources (RES), primarily concerning photovoltaics (PV) and wind power, could amplify this issue by creating more frequent transient periods of power imbalance. Theoretically, inverter-based generation could be controlled to respond to frequency imbalances by altering their electric torque (active power output). Synthetic inertia is defined as the ‚Äúcontrolled contribution of electrical torque from a unit that is proportional to the [rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) at the terminals of the unit.‚Äù However, in order to have capacity to react to this RoCoF, the participating generators would be required to operate at levels below their maximum output, so that a portion of their output is reserved for this particular response. Further, the inherent variability of production limits the generators capacity to provide synthetic inertia. This requirement of a reliable, fast acting, power supply makes inverter-based energy storage a better candidate for providing synthetic inertia.  History  Hydro-Qu√©bec began requiring synthetic inertia in 2005 as the first grid operator. To counter frequency drop, the grid operator demands a temporary 6% power boost by combining the power electronics with the rotational inertia of a wind turbine rotor. Similar requirements came into effect in Europe in 2016, and Australia in 2020. Synchronverter Model Figure 2. Power part of a synchronverter Figure 3. The per-phase model of an SG connected to an infinite bus Synchronverter structure can be divided into two parts: power part (see figure 2) and electronic part. The power part is energy transform and transfer path, including the bridge, filter circuit, power line, etc. The electronic part refers to measuring and control units, including sensors and DSP. The important point in modeling synchronverter is to be sure that it has similar dynamic behavior to Synchronous generator (see figure 3). This model is classified into 2-order up to 7-order model, due to its complexity. However, 3-order model is widely used because of proper compromise between accuracy and complexity. :V_{q} = \\\\omega ( E_{q}+x_{d}.i_{d} )+i_{q} .R_{s} :V_{d} = \\\\omega ( E_{d}+x_{q}.i_{q} )+i_{d} .R_{s} where V_{d} and V_{q} are dq-axes components of terminal voltage. While synchronverter terminal voltage and current satisfy these equations, synchronverter can be looked as Synchronous generator. This make it possible to replace it by a synchronous generator model and solve the problems easily. Control strategy Figure 4. Typical control structures for a grid-connected power inverter.(a) When controlled as a voltage supply.(b) When controlled as a current supply. As shown in the figure 3, when the inverter is controlled as a voltage source, it consists of a synchronization unit to synchronize with the grid and a power loop to regulate the real power and reactive power exchanged with the grid. The synchronization unit often needs to provide frequency and amplitude.S. Shinnaka, ‚ÄúA novel fast-tracking D-Estimation method for single-phase signals,‚Äù IEEE Trans. Power Electron., vol. 26, no. 4, pp. 1081‚Äì1088, Apr. 2011. But when inverter is controlled as a current source, the synchronization unit is often required to provide the phase of the grid only, so it is much more easier to control it as a current source.M. Kazmierkowski and L. Malesani, ‚ÄúCurrent control techniques for threephase voltage-source PWM converters: A survey,‚Äù IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron., vol. 45, no. 5, pp. 691‚Äì703, Oct. 1998. Figure 5. Compact control structure for a grid-connected inverter. Since a synchronous generator is inherently synchronized with the grid, it is possible to integrate the synchronization function into the power controller without synchronization unit. This results in a compact control unit, as shown in the figure 4. Applications PV Figure 6. Power part of three-phase synchronverter. As mentioned before, synchronverters can be treated like synchronous generator, which make it easier to control the source, so it should be widely used in PV primary energy sources (PES).

It is on Stannard Mountain Road, in what was formerly the Stannard Schoolhouse, one of the only municipal buildings in the town. Of uncertain (but likely pre-1850) construction, it served as a school until 1964. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history The town center of Stannard, a small rural community of northern Vermont, is little more than a crossroads at Stannard Mountain Road and Lazy Mill Road, with dispersed residences. The town hall, one of two public buildings in the town center (along with the Methodist Episcopal Church), is located east of the junction, on the north side of Stannard Mountain Road. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a front- facing gable roof, clapboarded exterior, and granite foundation. The main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows flanking a center entrance, and two symmetrically placed sash windows on the second level. The windows are topped by projecting lintels. The east facade has a bank of sash windows in its rear half, an early 20th century alteration to meet state school standards. with The first school was organized in Stannard in 1812, but met in private residences or barns with only small numbers of students. Its first school building was constructed in 1823. The present building is not documented until it appears on an 1875 map; its styling is vernacular Greek Revival, which is typical of mid-19th century school buildings in rural Vermont. It also exhibits features consistent with construction after state standards for schools were first introduced in 1846. The building served as a school until 1964, and has housed the town offices since.

Hoffman received a Bachelor of Arts degree in quantitative psychology from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1978, and earned his Doctorate of Philosophy in computational psychology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1983 under David Marr and Whitman Richards. He was briefly a Research Scientist at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of MIT, and then became an assistant professor at the University of California at Irvine (UCI) in 1983. He has remained on the faculty of UCI since then, with a sabbatical during the 1995-1996 academic year at the Zentrum f√ºr Interdisziplin√§re Forschung of Bielefeld University. Donald D. Hoffman Work Introduction and overview Hoffman notes that the commonly held view that brain activity causes conscious experience has, so far, proved to be intractable in terms of scientific explanation. Hoffman proposes a solution to the hard problem of consciousness by adopting the converse view that consciousness causes brain activity and, in fact, creates all objects and properties of the physical world. To this end, Hoffman developed and combined two theories: the \\"multimodal user interface\\" (MUI) theory of perception and \\"conscious realism\\". Multimodal user interface (MUI) theory MUI theory states that \\"perceptual experiences do not match or approximate properties of the objective world, but instead provide a simplified, species-specific, user interface to that world.\\" Hoffman argues that conscious beings have not evolved to perceive the world as it actually is but have evolved to perceive the world in a way that maximizes \\"fitness payoffs\\". Hoffman uses the metaphor of a computer desktop and icons - the icons of a computer desktop provide a functional interface so that the user does not have to deal with the underlying programming and electronics in order to use the computer efficiently. Similarly, objects that we perceive in time and space are metaphorical icons which act as our interface to the world and enable us to function as efficiently as possible without having to deal with the overwhelming amount of data underlying reality. Conscious Realism Conscious Realism is described as a non-physicalist monism which holds that consciousness is the primary reality and the physical world emerges from that. The objective world consists of conscious agents and their experiences that cannot be derived from physical particles and fields. \\"What exists in the objective world, independent of my perceptions, is a world of conscious agents, not a world of unconscious particles and fields. Those particles and fields are icons in the MUIs of conscious agents, but are not themselves fundamental denizens of the objective world. Consciousness is fundamental.\\" The Case Against Reality  Prof. Donald Hoffman on Conscious Agent Theory Nov 9, 2019 Perception of physical world is a byproduct of consciousness Together, MUI theory and Conscious Realism form the foundation for an overall theory that the physical world is not objective but is an epiphenomenon (secondary phenomenon) caused by consciousness. Hoffman has said that some form of reality may exist, but may be completely different from the reality our brains model and perceive.Interview with Annaka and Sam Harris, 12/19, https://samharris.org/podcasts/178-reality-illusion Reality may not be made of space time and physical objects.TED talk, Do we see reality as it is?

Early years and education Sarah Ellen Blackwell was the youngest daughter of Hannah (Lane) Blackwell and Samuel Blackwell, a sugar refiner and lay preacher. She was born in Bristol, England, and her family emigrated to the United States four years later, eventually settling in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her father died when she was a child, and she was educated in part by her older sisters, the physicians Elizabeth Blackwell and Emily Blackwell. Other siblings included the abolitionist Samuel Charles Blackwell and the social reformer Henry Browne Blackwell. Blackwell was interested in the arts, and around 1850 she began studying art at the newly opened Philadelphia School of Design for Women; she also took classes in New York. In 1855, she went to Europe to continue her training, studying design in Paris before moving on to study painting in London with John Ruskin. She funded her trip in part by writing weekly letters for two Philadelphia newspapers, an opportunity that opened up after one of her stories won a prize in a magazine contest. Career On her return to New York after four years in Europe, she opened a studio and began teaching painting and drawing. She eventually closed this studio in order to work with her physician sisters, though she continued to write for magazines and newspapers. She published a series of letters about Anna Ella Carroll, whose role as an adviser to President Lincoln's cabinet during the American Civil War was being much discussed at the time by feminists. In 1891, she published the first full- length biography of Carroll, the well-researched but partisan A Military Genius: Life of Anna Ella Carroll. More recent biographies and analyses generally take a more moderate view of Carroll's accomplishments than Blackwell did. Blackwell was active in the anti-vivisection movement. She died in 1901, and many of her letters are held among the Blackwell family papers at Radcliffe College's Schlesinger Library.

Its indirect consequence was the elimination of Uskok piracy in the Adriatic Sea. Background In the aftermath of the Long Turkish War, a large number of refugees settled in the area Senj on the Holy Roman military frontier with the Ottoman Empire. The refugees swelled the ranks of Uskoks, a type of irregular militia that conducted cross border raids upon the Ottomans. Apart from their raiding activities, the Uskoks did not shy away from piracy, attacking ships without regard towards the ethnic background or religious affiliation of their crews. In 1606, the Ottomans and Holy Roman Empire signed the Treaty of Zitva Torok which prohibited cross border raiding across the two states. In 1615, the treaty was renewed, prompting more Uskoks to turn towards piracy in the Adriatic Sea. Their activities had negatively impacted the mercantile interests of the Republic of Venice since as far as 1564, which was already aiming to expand its territory towards Habsburg Istria. Venice hired mercenaries in the Kingdom of England and the Dutch Republic, launching blockade of Holy Roman, Adriatic ports. On 20 December 1615, the blockade escalated into the Uskok War with a Venetian invasion of the coastal areas. The Spanish Viceroy of Naples Pedro T√©llez-Gir√≥n, 3rd Duke of Osuna, intervened into the conflict on the Imperial side, without Spanish approval. The Habsburgs failed to mount an appropriate response as the country faced an internal power struggle. Nevertheless the Venetians were decimated by disease, failing to exploit their numerical superiority. Although negotiations continued throughout the conflict, an agreement was only reached in 1617 with the aid of Spanish, Papal and French mediation. Treaty On 26 September 1617, Imperial diplomat Karl von Harrach became the cosignatory of the Treaty of Madrid along with Venetian ambassadors Giustiniani and Contarini, ending the conflict between the two states. The Venetians agreed to the withdrawal of their troops from Imperial territories, while also discharging the English and Dutch mercenaries. The Habsburgs in their turn, agreed to transfer the Uskoks further to the north east by June 1618, while also cutting the number of their forces to 1,000 men. A regular Habsburg garrison was to be established in Senj. The Duke of Osuna remained defiant of both the treaty and the wishes of the Spanish crown, unilaterally continuing his maritime campaign. He was eventually arrested by Spanish authorities in 1620, and convicted of conspiring to become an independent ruler of Naples. Uskoks were either expelled from the empire or resettled deeper into Croatia. The few families that were allowed to stay were closely monitored, ending the Uskok piratical reign.

He briefly led the Congolese army that July. He was executed alongside Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba in Katanga in 1961. Biography Maurice Mpolo was born on 12 September 1928 in Inongo, Belgian Congo. His father was Alphonse Membe. He had five years of primary education before studying as a novitiate for three years at the Fr√©res des √âcoles Chr√©tiennes √† Tumba. He later attended school in L√©opoldville but was forced to drop out due to domestic problems. He became involved in several private enterprises and served in the colonial police force, though he was dismissed from duty on 10 September 1952 after being repeatedly reprimanded for displaying arrogance and indiscipline. Mpolo also worked as a journalist and was arrested by the Belgian administration for publishing opinions they considered \\"displaced\\", though he was freed after an appeal. He eventually became the president of the L√©opoldville chapter of the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) and participated in the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference in Brussels, Belgium on the organisation's behalf.  Government career  The first Congolese government. Mpolo stands seventh from the right. With the independence of the Republic of the Congo in June 1960, Mpolo was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a representative from the Lac L√©opold II District. He was subsequently appointed by Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba to be Minister of Youth and Sports, effectively becoming the government's chief propagandist. He briefly stood in for General Victor Lundula as commander in chief of the Arm√©e Nationale Congolaise (ANC) in July (earning the title of General) but got in a dispute with the army chief of staff, Colonel Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu. On 28 July Mpolo was made a member of a cabinet committee established to handle Congolese relations with United Nations officials. On 13 September Lumumba declared him commander-in-chief of the ANC. On 14 September, Mobutu launched a coup which \\"neutralised\\" Lumumba's government and created a new one. Mpolo attempted to undermine it and rivaled Mobutu for control of the army. On 23 September, Mpolo and Deputy Prime Minister Antoine Gizenga were arrested and plans were made to send them to secessionist Katanga. The United Nations (UN) put pressure on Mobutu to release them, which he did the following day. On 7 October, Lumumba announced that he had formed a new cabinet that included Mpolo as Minister of Defence. Mpolo told the press that he believed all of the conflicted parties in the central government would eventually unite. Angered by this, Mobutu dispatched troops to Mpolo's house, but he was nowhere to be found. Later that day Mpolo was able to return to his home unmolested and requested that the UN strengthen its guard at his residence.  Arrest and death  In late November Lumumba fled the capital to organise a new government in Stanleyville. He was captured before he could complete his escape and imprisoned at the army camp in Thysville. Mpolo also intended on reaching Stanleyville, but before he left he addressed a crowd of Lumumba's supporters at Lac L√©opold II. With Mobutu's government fearing Mpolo's potential to rally support for his cause, troops were dispatched to find him and arrested him in Mushie. He was later transferred to Thysville, along with Vice President of the Senate Joseph Okito. On 17 January 1961, discipline in the base faltered and all three men were flown to √âlisabethville, Katanga. Once there, they were brutally tortured at the hands of Mo√Øse Tshombe and Godefroid Munongo, Lumumba's chief political rivals and the leaders of the secessionist state. That night, one by one they were lined up against a tree to be executed by firing squad. Mpolo was the second to be shot. On 17 January 2011, a mass of thanksgiving was held in memory of Mpolo and Okito at the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Kinshasa.

He wrote lyrics for hundreds of songs that were composed and recorded by prominent composers and performers. Early life Yoram Taharlev was born January 24, 1938 to Yaffa Yitzikovitz and author and poet Haim Taharlev, in kibbutz Yagur. During his military service, he served as a reporter for an army newspaper.  Career  Works Taharlev mostly wrote for festivals and competitions, including the Israeli Song Festival and the Eurovision Song Contest. He published many poetry and song books. For many years he served as a publisher for the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Taharlev has a diverse repertoire. Among his songs, one can find love songs, patriotic songs, songs about nature and about friendship and humorous songs. His song \\"Ammunition Hill\\" (Hebrew: Givat Hatachmoshet) is among many that struck a chord with the public due to its authentic description of the battle at Jerusalem's Ammunition Hill during the Six-Day War. \\"Be My Friend, Be My Brother\\" (Hebrew: Heye li Haver Heye li Ach) is about friendship and \\"The Ballad of Yoel Moshe Salomon\\" (Hebrew: HaBalada Shel Yoel Salomon) sung by Arik Einstein, which starts off with the words \\"On a humid morning in 1878\\" (Hebrew: ◊ë◊ë◊ï◊ß◊® ◊ú◊ó ◊ë◊©◊†◊™ ◊™◊®◊ú\\"◊ó BeVoker Lach BiShnat Tarlach) is a description of an episode in Israeli history (the founding of the town of Petah Tikva). Secular reading of Holy books After writing hundreds of poems, Taharlev dedicated himself to reading and writing about traditional Jewishbooks and writings. Taharlev: \\"I am reading the holy texts with secular eyes\\". He wrote several books, in which, he reviewed and analyzed Jewish texts. Taharlev labels this works as: \\"a fresh and humoristic look at the holy and traditional Jewish books and writings\\". His interpretations are highly regarded by both secular and religious communities. His book, Al Birkey Avot\\" (perush to 'Pirkey Avot') was among the biggest sellers in 2016. His book Simchat Tora ‚Äì is a humoristic commentary of all the 'torah portions of the week'. \\"Tharlev's has a considerable successes in bringing closer to the Jewish tradition, people who are draw back, from everything which is seems to be religious and traditional\\".Prof. Yona Shamir Taharlev exposed them to the beauty and the brilliance of it. His slogan is \\"learn with joy and smile\\"! He stated \\"If the religious and traditional books were being conveying to us in such way and a smile, we could find out much more about our roots and we wouldn‚Äôt be so detached from them\\". Israeli Prize laureate Eliyahu Ha'Cohen said, \\"although being born in a kibbutz and a main lyricist of the army bands and pop songs, Taharlev drowns a lot of his motives and inspiration from the bible; he is the most 'Jewish' among the Israeli lyricists\\". Songs During the agriculture Jewish Biblical holidays, the National memorial ceremonies, weddings and the earth reserving battles, his songs are played. \\"Go and walkabout the country\\", became the slogan of the Nature reserve associations, \\"Be my friend, be my brother\\" is sang at every memorial, \\"Ammunitions Hill\\" became a symbol of Independence day ceremonies, the \\"Green mountain\\" (about the Carmel mountain where Taharlev was born) is a symbol of the Tu be‚ÄôSvat holiday (the trees holiday). This song is the most popular among Israeli children, though, they omit the last heart-breaking lines in which Taharlev describes bringing back to the mountain a fallen comrade who, like him, was born there. The song \\"By His Hands He Will Bring\\" (Hebrew: ◊¢◊ú ◊õ◊§◊ô◊ï ◊ô◊ë◊ô◊ê Al Kapav Yavi) sung by Rivka Zohar, was written after an encounter with an unemployed carpenter, in a poor neighbourhood, who was sitting in his empty workshop with the hope of building a chair for the prophet Elijah who would come and redeem him from his troubles. His song \\"Hora\\" (Hebrew: ◊î◊ï◊®◊î), sung by Avi Toledano, won second place at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1982. Many of Taharlev's songs were written from his childhood experiences in kibbutz Yagur among which are \\"The Mountain Which is Always Green\\" (Hebrew: ◊î◊î◊® ◊î◊ô◊®◊ï◊ß ◊™◊û◊ô◊ì HaHar HaYarok Tamid) written about Mount Carmel near Yagur, \\"Four in the Afternoon\\" (Hebrew: ◊ê◊®◊ë◊¢ ◊ê◊ó◊® ◊î◊¶◊î◊®◊ô◊ô◊ù Arba Ahar HaTzhorhayim) about life in the kibbutz, \\"In The Grove Near The Trough\\" (Hebrew: ◊ë◊§◊®◊ì◊° ◊ú◊ô◊ì ◊î◊©◊ï◊ß◊™ BaPardes LeYad HaShoket) written about the tree groves where he worked and often came to for solitude, and \\"Shadow And Well Water\\" (Hebrew: ◊¶◊ú◊ï◊û◊ô ◊ë◊ê◊® Tzel Ve Mei Beer) about an event from 1945 during which a group of immigrants were brought to Yagur after their release from a detention camp in Atlit to hide from the British. In the song he wrote \\"He whose hut has fallen dormant will walk through the door and may forever stay\\". His songs were composed by many Israeli composers among which are Moshe Vilenski, Nachum Hayman, Nurit Hirsh, Matti Caspi, Moni Amerillio, Shalom Hanoch and Efy Netzer. The first to compose with him was Nachum Hayman from Beit Alpha to whom Taharlev sent the lyrics of the song \\"You, Me and the Wind\\" (Hebrew: ◊ê◊™ ◊ï◊ê◊†◊ô ◊ï◊î◊®◊ï◊ó At Ve Ani Ve HaRuach). The song was performed by the singing group The Parvarim (The Suburbs).

Origin The idea of intelligent micro-drones which could communicate with each other was pioneered by a group of students studying at the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2011. They were subsequently modified for military use in 2013 under the direction of the United States Department of Defense Strategic Capabilities Office. The drone system was named after the character in Greek mythology of the same name. Autonomy Each individual drone is not controlled in itself but instead it shares a collective, distributed \\"brain,\\" travelling in leaderless \\"swarms,\\" members of which can adapt to changes in drone numbers and remain co-ordinated with their counterparts. Having multiple micro-drones carrying out surveillance is tactically advantageous to simply having one large drone because it is easier for the micro-drones to dodge air defense systems. The drones have the ability to collectively determine whether they have completed a mission, leading some commentators to argue that Perdix drones are artificially intelligent. Testing F/A18 jets drop Perdix drones over California in a test exercise. The first operational test of the militarized Perdix drones was conducted by the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School in September 2014 over Edwards Air Force Base. The drones were placed in the flare canisters of F-16 Fighting Falcon and deployed to operate at a lower altitude. A year later, in September 2015, 90 Perdix missions were flown over Alaska to test maritime surveillance capabilities. In October 2016, 103 Perdix drones were dropped from three F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets in a joint effort with the US Naval Air Systems Command over their base at China Lake, California. As with earlier tests, the drones were packed into flare canisters for the jets to eject. The test was a success and elicited significant media coverage when announced on 9 January 2017. These tests conclude that the drones can be safely launched at a speed of Mach 0.6 and in temperatures as low as . Photographers shooting a feature of the drones for CBS television program 60 Minutes reportedly almost abandoned attempts to film the drones as their size and speed made getting a focussed image difficult. Design Perdix drones have two sets of wings which are straddled by a plastic body containing a lithium battery and a small camera. Propulsion is provided by a propeller at the rear. 3D printing is used to create Perdix drones' bodies while the onboard software can be updated to enable refinements and improvements to be made without having to manufacture a new drone. The Perdix software is currently in its sixth generation and the Department of Defense aims to have the capability to produce the drones in batches of 1,000 in the near future. Specifications The published specifications of Perdix drones are listed below. General characteristics * Length: 6.5 inches / 165mm * Wingspan: 11.8 inches / 300mm * Weight: 290 grams * Propeller diameter: 2.6 inches / 66mm Performance * Maximum speed: 70 mph / 113 km/h * Endurance: 20 minutes See also *MIT discoveries and innovation *Defense Innovation Unit Experimental *Micro air vehicle References Unmanned aerial vehicles of the United States Micro air vehicles 3D printed objects ","title":"Perdix (drone)"},{"id":"52847640","text":"The Imb√© River () is a river in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

History On the site of the current convent, a Franciscan monastery was founded in 1479 on the site of an older Franciscan monastery, founded by Bishop John Innes of Innes. The Order of Friars Minor Conventual (Greyfriars) was introduced in Scotland by king Alexander II in the 13th century, and settled in Elgin in the 15th century. This Franciscan monastery was secularized in 1559 during the Scottish Reformation. In the 16th century, the buildings of the former monastery housed a court and the Chamber of Commerce. In 1648 the monastery was converted into a residence of the King family and remained as such for 120 years. At that time, the abbey church became the episcopal church. In 1818 this residence was bought by the Stewart family. The Sisters of Mercy bought the ruined buildings of the monastery and the St. Sylvester Church in 1891, which were then restored from 1896 to 1908, thanks to the financial support of John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquis of Bute and his son Colum Crichton-Stuart, according to a project made by the architect John Kinross. On 4 October 1898 in the church of the monastery the first Catholic Mass since the Reformation was celebrated. Until the early 2000s, the Sisters of Mercy ran a kindergarten and a primary school. The monastery is now occupied by the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia.

Miller's began his career as an entertainer through his 3 respective, but now defunct YouTube channels: DizastaMusic, TVFilthyFrank, and TooDamnFilthy. They consisted of rap songs, swearing, rants, extreme challenges, ukulele performances and a shock humor show titled The Filthy Frank Show, with most of the main characters played by Miller, including the titular character of Filthy Frank. To complement his TVFilthyFrank channel, Miller produced comedy hip hop music under his Pink Guy alias, who is also a zentai-wearing recurring character on The Filthy Frank Show, with his songs featured on the show and his discography spanning two full-length projects and an extended play. Miller's videos had widespread impact, including starting a viral dance craze known as the Harlem Shake, which was directly responsible for the debut of Baauer's \\"Harlem Shake\\" song atop the Billboard Hot 100. Many YouTube personalities have made major or cameo appearances on The Filthy Frank Show, including h3h3Productions, iDubbbz, JonTron, Michael Stevens, and PewDiePie. In December 2017, Miller stated he had retired the channel to focus on his music career, under the name Joji, producing more nuanced and serious music, releasing the EP In Tongues, which peaked at number 58 on the Billboard 200, and his debut studio album Ballads 1, which reached number 1 on Billboards top R&B; and hip-hop chart in November 2018. With this, Miller became the first Asian-born artist to do so. Miller's music has been described as a mix between R&B;, lo-fi and trip hop.  Early life  George Kusunoki Miller was born on 18 September 1992, in Osaka, Japan. He is half Japanese and half Australian. He attended an international school, Canadian Academy, in Kobe, Japan, where he graduated in 2012. At age 18, he left Japan and travelled to the United States. Miller made attempts to maintain his privacy, such as deleting the video \\"Filthy Frank Exposes Himself?\\", where he revealed himself to be a college student in Brooklyn, New York, and that he did not want to reveal personal information for fear of not being able to get a job later on due to the nature of his show.  Entertainment career   The Filthy Frank Show (2011‚Äì2017)  Miller created the \\"Filthy Frank\\" character during his time on his DizastaMusic YouTube channel, on which he created sketch comedy-based content. The channel started gaining popularity after his 2012 conceptualization of Filthy Frank, a character who was described as the anti-vlogger of YouTube by Miller. The first known video on this particular channel (before his creation of the Frank character) was uploaded on 19 June 2008, and was titled \\"Lil Jon falls off a table\\". The DizastaMusic channel has over 977,000 subscribers and 170 million views . On 15 August 2014, Miller uploaded a video to the DizastaMusic channel, announcing that he would not be posting any more video content onto the channel, under the risk of losing the channel due to the numerous copyright and community strikes it received. On Miller's channel, TVFilthyFrank, he had many different series on his channel, such as \\"Food\\" (ÂíåÈ£ü„É©„ÉÉ„Éó), \\"Japanese 101\\", \\"Wild Games\\" and \\"Loser Reads Hater Comments\\". This channel currently has a total of 7.35 million subscribers and 1.05 billion views . Miller opened a third channel, TooDamnFilthy, on 1 July 2014. On this channel he had two series, \\"Japanese 101\\", which is also featured on his main channel, and \\"Cringe of the Week\\", which is usually abbreviated to \\"COTW\\". , TooDamnFilthy has 2.25 million subscribers and 300 million views. On 27 September 2017, Miller announced the release of his first and currently only book, titled Francis of the Filth, which addresses things uncovered in The Filthy Frank Show, and serves as a culmination of the series. On 29 December 2017, Miller released a statement on Twitter explaining that he had stopped producing comedy, including Filthy Frank, due to both \\"serious health conditions\\" and his personal lack of interest in continuing the series. In September 2018, Miller stated in a BBC Radio 1 interview that he had no choice but to stop producing comedy due to his health condition. = Legacy = Miller's Filthy Frank show has had a profound impact on internet culture, responsible for creating many internet memes. Miller's show has been hailed as \\"the epitome of odd\\". Miller's videos had widespread impact, which included starting a viral dance craze known as the Harlem Shake back in 2013, which was directly responsible for the debut of Baauer's \\"Harlem Shake\\" song atop the Billboard Hot 100. Fellow YouTuber and friend of Miller, Ethan Klein (also known under his alias of h3h3Productions) described Filthy Frank as the greatest YouTuber of all time in a 2017 interview with First We Feast.First We Feast (30 March 2017), H3H3 Productions Does Couples Therapy While Eating Spicy Wings. Retrieved 20 November 2018, event occurs at 1:39, via YouTube  Music career   Pink Guy (2014‚Äì2017)  Miller always had a passion for music composition. He has expressed that even before his YouTube career, he had an interest in creating music and created his YouTube channel as a means of promoting it. In an interview with Pigeons and Planes, he said, \\"I've always wanted to make normal music. I just started the YouTube channel to kind of bump my music. But then Filthy Frank and the Pink Guy stuff ended up getting way bigger than I thought so I had to kind of roll with it.\\" Miller's music under Pink Guy is often comical, staying true to the nature of his YouTube channel. His debut album, Pink Season, debuted at number 70 on the Billboard 200. Under his comedy rap stage name, Pink Guy, Miller has produced one mixtape, one album, and one extended play, Pink Guy, Pink Season, and Pink Season: The Prophecy, respectively. On 16 March 2017, Miller performed for the first time as Pink Guy at SXSW. Future plans were stated to include a \\"long overdue\\" tour, a third Pink Guy album and more progress on his personal music outside of the Pink Guy persona. However, as of 29 December 2017, Joji has ceased production of all Filthy Frank-related content, including Pink Guy music.  Joji (2015‚Äìpresent)  Aside from the comedic and often rap-based music he created under the Pink Guy alias, Miller also created more serious and traditional music under another stage name, Joji, which became his primary focus in late 2017. Speaking on his transition from his YouTube career to his music career as Joji, Miller said to Billboard \\"now I get to do stuff that I want to hear.\\" In the article by Billboard, he specified that 'Joji' isn't a character like Filthy Frank and Pink Guy. \\"I guess that's the difference,\\" he continues. \\"Joji's just me.\\" During his time growing up in Higashinada-ku, Kobe, Japan, Miller began to produce music and sing with friends as a side- hobby and a way to pass the time. After relocating to Manhattan, New York, Miller expanded upon his music career by starting his Pink Guy persona, which paved the way for his Joji persona. Miller originally announced his Joji album on 3 May 2014 alongside the first Pink Guy album. However, Miller subtly cancelled the project until he began releasing music under the name PinkOmega. Miller released two songs as PinkOmega: \\"Dumplings\\" on 4 June 2015 and \\"wefllagn.ii 5\\" on 28 August 2015, both of which were later released on the Pink Guy album Pink Season, the latter being re-titled \\"We Fall Again\\". Miller intended to keep the music made under Joji a secret from his fanbase due to them mainly wanting his comedic music. In late 2015, two singles were released, titled \\"Thom\\" and \\"You Suck Charlie\\"; both were released under a false alias, but it was quickly leaked that the user behind the account was Miller, which prompted him in January 2016 to publicly announce on Instagram that he was releasing a full-length commercial project titled Chloe Burbank: Volume 1. In the same post, he linked his SoundCloud account. In 2017, Joji released several songs via the YouTube channel of Asian music label 88rising, the songs \\"I Don't Wanna Waste My Time\\", released on 26 April 2017, \\"Rain on Me\\", released on 19 July 2017, and \\"Will He\\", released on 17 October 2017. Joji was featured in the song \\"Nomadic\\" with the Chinese rap group Higher Brothers. Miller performed live as Joji for the first time on 18 May 2017 in Los Angeles. The event was streamed by the Boiler Room. On 17 October 2017, Miller released the debut single from his debut commercial project, In Tongues. The single, titled \\"Will He\\", was released on platforms Spotify and iTunes. Miller's debut project under the moniker Joji, an EP titled In Tongues, was released on 3 November 2017 by Empire Distribution. A deluxe version of the EP was released on 14 February 2018 with 8 remixes of songs from the EP along with the release of \\"Plastic Taste\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna Waste My Time\\" as part of the track listing. Joji released the song \\"Yeah Right\\" in May 2018, becoming his first to chart on a Billboard chart, peaking at 23 on the Billboard R&B; Songs chart. Miller debuted Ballads 1 under the label 88rising on 26 October 2018, which quickly peaked the Billboard Top R&B;/Hip Hop Albums Chart. Shortly after its release, Miller announced a North American tour, spanning 9 dates in early 2019. At that time, he was already on tour for Ballads 1 in Europe. On 4 June 2019, Miller announced his new single titled \\"Sanctuary\\" through his Instagram page and released it on 14 June. It was accompanied by a music video, which was uploaded to 88rising's official YouTube channel. Joji was featured in the song \\"Where Does the Time Go?\\" with Indonesian rapper Rich Brian on his second album The Sailor. On 30 January 2020, Miller announced another new single, \\"Run\\", which released at midnight on 6 February 2020 alongside a music video released later that day. On 2 March 2020, he performed the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. On 16 April 2020, Joji announced another new single, \\"Gimme Love\\", which released at midnight, and along with announced his upcoming album Nectar, which was initially set to be released on 10 July 2020. However, on 12 June 2020, Joji announced that the album had been pushed back to 25 September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.https://twitter.com/sushitrash/status/1271601995674275841 Musical style Joji's music has been described as trip hop and lo-fi that blends elements of trap, folk, electronic, and R&B.; His songs have been characterized as having \\"down tempo, melancholic themes and soulful vocals\\" with \\"minimalistic production\\". He has been compared to electronic artist James Blake, whom he also names as an influence alongside Radiohead, Shlohmo and Donald Glover. In an interview with Pigeons and Planes, Miller said that his music was inspired by his time growing up in Osaka and by boom bap instrumentals he listened to while attending Canadian Academy.  Personal life  Miller lives in Brooklyn, New York. Miller often flies to Los Angeles for work and has a residence there. Miller has an undisclosed neurological disorder that causes stress-induced seizures. This is one of the reasons that led him to quit his YouTube career.

Memorial exhibition of the Memorial Centre Lipa Remembers Center is restored in a sight of the older Memorial museum of Lipa that functioned from 1968 till 1989 when it was closed due to lack of funds. Center is dedicated to the one event of the World War II history, to the suffering of 30 April 1944 when 269 inhabitants of Lipa were killed in just a few hours. Victims were all civilians, mainly elderly people, women and children. This crime was committed by the Nazis and Fascists during the Braunschweig offensive, a military operation aimed against the partisans. The killings of civilians were followed by ransacking and arson of their homes and outbuildings. Around hundred Lipa inhabitants survived, those who were lucky enough to be absent from the village at the time of the massacre: men being in partisans, women taking food to the partisan hideouts, children taking cattle to pastures, few man preparing traditional bonfire on the surrounding hills etc. Those survivors greeted the end of World War II homeless and desperate. A long and strenuous reconstruction began with lives affected by a sense of loss. Today Lipa lives and remembers. Memorial Centre‚Äôs permanent exhibition interprets the history of World War II in the region of Liburnian Karst which, besides Lipa, incorporates the villages of Pasjak, Rupa, ≈†apjane and Brdce. Memorial exhibition is complemented by the cultural and ethnographic heritage of the region showing the continuity of life, starting from prehistoric times until today. Using a holistic approach, the tragic event of April 30, 1944 can be seen in a broader context, as one of the many identity features belonging to the vital and potent community of Lipa. Ethnographic exhibition of the Memorial Centre Lipa Remembers The Centers activities are based on the principles of community museums and homeland museums. In unity with the local population Centre actively contributes to the research and creation of this region‚Äôs identity, and also helps discovering new and sustainable possibilities for development and growth. All programme activities are concentrated on promoting tolerance, nonviolence and life in a multitude of its manifestations and features.  Suffering of Lipa on the 30th of April 1944   German occupation  From October 1943 entire Liburnian Karst area is under German occupation within the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral (OZAK). After the Italian armistice Fascists continued to operate together with the occupational forces under the German command. Partisans were gathering in great secrecy, taking numerous guerrilla actions dependent on the local population that provided them hideouts, food and supplies. In November 1943 OZAK was declared area for fighting against partisan \\"gangs\\" (Bandenkampfgebiet) and in January 1944 special Command of the SS and police was formed in Trieste (Fuhrungsstab f√ºr Bandenbek√§mpfen - FSBB) for planning and conducting that fight against partisans and their supporters under the command of Odilon Globoƒçnik, Higher SS and Police Leader of OZAK. So-called Ten Commandments, rules issued on the 24th of February 1944 by general of the 97th German army corps Ludwig K√ºbler, encouraged occupiers to use looting, arson of civilian property and killing of civilian population as effective means of fighting the Partisan ‚Äûgangs‚Äú. = Braunschweig offensive = Because of the German's inability to establish control over railroad and road traffic on the Rijeka-Trieste stretch, Ludwig K√ºbler decided to try to keep Istrian partisans away by launching a new offensive on the mountain massif Uƒçka-Planik-Lisina. The offensive, known as the Braunschweig offensive was launched on the 25th of April 1944 with the participation of motorized Wehrmacht forces and special SS police formations. Anticipating the Nazis' intentions, partisans managed to withdraw the main force units from the Uƒçka and ƒÜiƒáarija sectors and transfer them north of the railway and the main road to the Klana-Kastav-Ilirska Bistrica area. Having moved most of their forces north, partisans went on with their operations and on 30 April 1944 launched a decisive attack with mortar fire on a garrison of fascist military police (Milizia per la Difesa Territoriale) situated in Rupa from a position near Lipa. The attack started at 5 a.m. and lasted two hours. The garrison's commander was Aurelio Piesz from Rijeka (Fiume). Unexpectedly, a smaller motorized German convoy appeared at Rupa and was subject to intense fire. Four German soldiers were killed and more still badly wounded; thereupon the partisan group withdrew to nearby Lisac village. An immediate rallying of Nazi and Fascist forces from the neighbouring and other garrisons followed.  Tragedy of the Lipa village  They entered the village of Lipa around 2.30 p.m. and started a massacre by torturing and killing 21 inhabitants, by burning down houses (87) and stables (85), seizing cattle and other valuable resources. The remaining inhabitants were ordered to pack their essentials and set out towards Rupa. At the last house in Lipa, they were told to leave their belongings and were forced into a building (so called Kvartirka's house), then the building was doused with petrol and set on fire. Many people were burned alive. The only survivors of the massacre were those who by chance were either not in Lipa that tragic Sunday, or somehow managed to hide (only six of them). 269 inhabitants were killed, of which were 96 children. The youngest victim Bosiljka Iskra was only 7 months old. Without trustworthy documentation, it is not possible to ascertain why the Nazis vented their anger on and took a genocidal reprisal against, of all people, the inhabitants of Lipa. They certainly wanted to frighten the inhabitants of Liburnian karst and divide them from the National Liberation Movement, which they supported. Regardless of the motive and reasons this was one of the most appalling war crimes committed in the territory of Istria in World War II.

December 4, 1997) was an American psychologist, known for the research he undertook on the psychology of crime victims. He was a one-time member of the New York Police Department, a psychologist, and a professor who studied the reactions of crime victims. Bard, in partnership with the police, conducted studies of crime victims (e.g., hostages, rape victims, and the families of murder victims). He published two volumes on domestic violence and crisis intervention. He also is recognized for having laid the foundation of victim-focused training into many law enforcement academies and the FBI National Academy.https://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-09/news/vw-2274_1_cancer-patients In 1979, Bard co-authored The Crime Victim's Book. This volume provides practical information on how best to identify and support the needs of crime victims. The Crime Victim‚Äôs Book was considered a \\"bible\\" for not only advocates but also crime victims.https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/14/nyregion/morton-bard-73-authority- on-crime-victims.htmlhttps://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/morton-dawn- sangrey-bard/the-crime-victims- book/http://vroh.uakron.edu/NCVRW_Step_5_HistoryMovement_3.php He is considered to have been a pivotal critical thinker in the development of the modern discipline of crisis intervention.http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5593&context;=jclc He also wrote scholary articles on the training of police officers in the application of different forms of crisis intervention out in the field. Education Bard received a bachelor's degree in 1947 from St. John's University. He later went on to receive a master's degree in 1948 and a doctorate in 1953, both in psychology from New York University. Career Bard started off his career in health psychology. From 1951 to 1961, he was a member of a clinical and research group at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. There, he analyzed the psychological effects of cancer and cancer surgery. During this time, Bard shifted the psychological focus from the role of personality in predisposing one to illnesses to the psychological consequences of living with illnesses like cancer. From 1965 to 1970, Bard taught at the City College of New York and was the director of its Psychology Center. In 1971, Bard joined CUNY‚Äôs graduate school and university center. He was a professor in the graduate school‚Äôs doctoral programs in social psychology and criminal justice. At the CUNY Graduate School, Bard studied hostage situations, third-party interventions in disputes, and the effects of personal crimes. Bard was a psychology professor at the City University of New York until his retirement in 1986. In 1982, Bard was named chairman of the American Psychological Association‚Äôs task force on victims of crime and violence. In 1982, he was awarded the New York State Psychological Association ‚Äôs Kurt Lewin Award. In 1985, he was appointed to a committee to advise the New York Mayor, Edward I. Koch, on the police department. The panel went on to make recommendations that included comprehensive changes in the training of police officers. Bard laid down the groundwork for training police as specialists in family crisis intervention. This included training for police officers on innovative crime prevention and mental health techniques so they were better able to provide immediate crisis intervention when emergencies arose and other professionals (e.g., social workers, psychologists) were not available. In the 1980s, Bard was a consultant in psychology to the departments of medicine and neurology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which in 1987 awarded him the Arthur M. Sutherland Award for ‚Äúpioneering research in psycho-oncology.‚Äù He was also the American Cancer Society‚Äôs national vice president for service and rehabilitation from 1986 to 1991.https://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-09/news/vw-2274_1_cancer-patients Personal life Bard married Arlene Cohen in 1948 and had two daughters (Erica Riley and Pamela Richlin).

It was released in the United States under the name, \\"Seeds of Freedom.\\" \\"Seeds of Freedom,\\" Variety, 11 September 1929 The film is based on real events. On 5 May 1902, shoemaker-laborer Hirsh Lekert, a member of the Jewish party Bund, attempted to murder the governor of Vilnius, Victor von Wahl. Plot On the eve of 1 May leaflets turn up in the city with the appeal to support the May Day demonstration of Vilnius workers. Cossacks disperse the May Day workers' march killing some and arresting others. Among the dead and arrested are Jewish laborers. Fearing riots, the Jewish bourgeois elite send their representatives to the governor with the request that he punish only the prisoners, and not the rest of the Jewish population. The governor agrees; he orders those who were arrested to be flogged. Hirsh Lekert, a cobbler, is outraged and proposes killing the governor. Despite advice from revolutionary friends (one intertitle states that \\"six shots do not make a revolution\\"), he shoots the governor and kills him. Lekert is arrested and sentenced to death.

The case was decided before the modern development of the doctrine of forum non conveniens and the decision of the House of Lords in Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd,. and is no longer considered to be good law in that regard. The case is often still referred to by way of illustration to the parochial and slightly paternalistic view previously taken by the English courts in relation to matters of jurisdiction, and in particular the comments of Lord Denning MR and Edmund Davies LJ. However the principle established by the case that presence within the jurisdiction is not negated only because it is a short or transient presence remains good law. Facts The Maharanee of BarodaThe case reports all utilise the spelling \\"Maharanee\\" rather than the more traditional \\"Maharani\\". and Mr Wildenstein both lived in France, although in the judgment they were both described as being \\"citizens of the world\\". Mr Wildenstein was an art dealer of international repute. In 1965 the Maharanee purchased a painting from Mr Wildenstein in Paris which was believed to be La Po√©sie by Fran√ßois Boucher for the equivalent of approximately ¬£33,000. In 1968 the painting was reviewed by Mr Francis Watson, who was the Surveyor of Her Majesty‚Äôs works of Art. He expressed the view that it was not a Boucher. The Maharanee sent the painting to Christie's for a formal valuation. They expressed the view that the painting \\"cannot be regarded as an autograph work by Fran√ßois Boucher, but would appear to be a work from his immediate circle of followers. We think that it might make about ¬£750 at auction...\\". The Maharanee instructed her solicitors to issue a writ against Mr Wildenstein claiming that painting was not a Boucher and seeking rescission and repayment of the purchase price. The writ was issued on 3 September 1969. However it was not served on Mr Wildenstein until 20 June 1970 when he was in the United Kingdom visiting the Ascot races. Mr Wildenstein objected to the court taking jurisdiction, and successfully applied for the writ to be set aside. The Maharanee appealed against that decision to the Court of Appeal. Judgment The lead judgment was given by Lord Denning MR. He held that the writ had been properly served on the defendant in England, and if a defendant is properly served with a writ while he is in this country, albeit on a short visit, the plaintiff was entitled to continue the proceedings to the end. The plaintiff had validly invoked the jurisdiction of the Queen‚Äôs courts; and was entitled to require those courts to proceed to adjudicate upon the claim. The courts should not strike the claim out unless it was vexatious or oppressive, or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court. If the statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action, the plaintiff is entitled to pursue it in the English courts, even though the cause of action did arise in a foreign country. It should not be stayed unless it would plainly be unjust to the defendant to require him to defend it in England, and that injustice must be so great as to outweigh the right of the plaintiff to continue the claim here. He held that the burden of proof was on Mr Wildenstein to show that it would be an injustice to him to have the case tried in England, and that he had not discharged that burden. Edmund Davies and Stephenson LJJ gave concurring judgments. Comments The case was notable for a number of comments made during the course of judgment about the superior nature of the English courts to the French ones, and rebuffing the notion that it would be inappropriate for the English courts to hear cases that were otherwise unconnected with England. In relation to the suggestion that the case should properly be tried in France, Lord Denning MR stated: Lord Denning would echo these comments a year later in The Atlantic Star, where he would say: Edmund Davies LJ also stated: Significance The case is no longer considered good law with respect to taking jurisdiction, and in modern times the decision would likely have been reversed, with a stay being granted on the basis of forum non conveniens. However the part of the decision that states that any transitory presence within the jurisdiction is still sufficient for the service of a writ remains good law. The position of jurisdiction between the English and French courts is also now regulated by the Brussels Regime.

It lies on the west side of 19th Avenue, at the intersection with Vicente, and just north of Stern Grove. The park is named for Carl Larsen, a chicken rancher, who donated the land for the park to the City in 1926. Larsen Park features a baseball diamond, tennis court, basketball court, playground and indoor pool; the pool, formerly named Larsen Pool, is now named for local swimming instructor Charlie Sava. Larsen Park earned the nickname Jet Plane Park by featuring three retired Navy jets from 1959 to 1993, used as play structures by local children, making the park a local landmark clearly visible from busy 19th Avenue. A jet-inspired sculpture and climbing structure were added to the playground in November 2015 after petitions and fundraising efforts by local residents. History Carl Larsen was a carpenter, restaurant owner, chicken rancher and landowner in the Sunset District; he donated the land that would become Larsen Park to the City in 1926. The park was built under the supervision of John McLaren and opened in 1927. Larsen's gift to the City is memorialized with a plaque attached to a rock at the corner of 19th and Ulloa, in the northeastern corner of the park; the plaque was sculpted by prominent sculptor M. Earl Cummings. Larsen was born in Odense, Denmark in 1844 and emigrated to the United States in his twenties. He moved to San Francisco in 1869 and was credited as one of the builders who worked on the since-demolished North Hall at UC-Berkeley. Larsen started the Tivoli Cafe at 18 Eddy Street in 1879; although it was subsequently destroyed in the earthquake and fire of 1906, Larsen rebuilt it along with the Hotel Larsen. During the donation ceremony, Larsen said, \\"It has been the fondest hope of my life to see a beautiful park on those rocks and hills.\\" Larsen Park opened with outdoor card rooms, one each for men and women; a baseball diamond; tennis courts; and a soccer field. The card rooms and soccer field are now gone. Work on the playground renovation began in July 2014. Jets at Larsen Park In 1959, the first retired Navy jet was installed, a Grumman F-9 Cougar which was transported by road from Moffett Field with the help of the California Highway Patrol. The tail number was 127490, within the block assigned to the F9F-6P reconnaissance variant with a camera in lieu of a nose gun; the F-9 also bore markings assigning it to Composite Squadron 61 (VC-61) with \\"PP\\" prominently displayed on the tail, which confirms it was a former reconnaissance plane. The F-9 was replaced by a North American FJ-2/-3 Fury in 1967, which was in turn replaced by a Vought F-8 Crusader in 1975. The Crusader was delivered by helicopter from Alameda Naval Air Station; it took a roundabout over-water course under both the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge before setting the plane down at the San Francisco Zoo for safety reasons. At the playground the Crusader was set almost flush with the ground, the cockpit was filled with concrete, the engine was replaced with a corrugated-metal crawl space, and a slide was attached to the side of the plane. The Crusader was removed in 1993 after city park officials were unwilling to pay for lead paint abatement; it was subsequently restored and is on display (but no climbing is allowed) at the Pacific Coast Air Museum (PCAM) in Santa Rosa. The Navy asked PCAM to take the plane several times before the museum consented and removed the airplane in 1993 with a crane and two flatbed trucks. It was assumed the landing gear had been removed when the Crusader was set flush to the ground, but when it was removed, the gear were found extended and resting in pits, and the tires still held air after reinflation. In gratitude for rescuing the Crusader, the National Naval Aviation Museum loaned several more planes to PCAM, including an A-6E Intruder, a F-14A Tomcat, and a F-16N Viper. Meanwhile, the playground continued to deteriorate and more equipment was removed over the years; in 2013, Supervisor Carmen Chu noted the only reason the playground had not been given a failing grade by the San Francisco Parks Alliance was because the remaining equipment did not meet the definition of a playground. A fundraising effort, including for a jet-inspired playground sculpture, culminated in a re-dedicated playground which opened on November 21, 2015. A retired plane was deemed too expensive and would create too many liability concerns, which is why the jet-inspired sculpture was chosen instead. Scott Peterson, who had designed the wave structure at the Koret Children's Quarter in Golden Gate Park, was selected as the designer for the jet sculpture. However, Peterson was removed from the project in June 2015 after the management team concluded he could not meet the contract specifications, and the jet sculpture was redesigned and built by GameTime instead. Sava Pool Besides the signature playground jet sculpture, baseball diamond and tennis courts, there is an indoor pool, the Charlie Sava Pool. The pool was once named the Larsen Pool, but was renamed in honor of Charlie Sava, a local swimming instructor who coached Olympic swimmer Ann Curtis. The old pool was razed in 2007, and a new Charlie Sava pool opened in December 2008 on the same site at a cost of . The pool has eight lanes long. The new pool building was designed by architects Mark Cavagnero and Paulett Taggart, and features \\"Swimmer's Waves,\\" an installation comprising a set of porcelain enamel-on-steel photographic prints from Catherine Wagner. The new building was honored with a 2009 American Architecture Award from the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design. The water level is set flush with the floor, and together with the floor-to-ceiling windows and general southern slope of the site, Wawona Street to the south of the building seems to disappear from the swimmers' perspective in the pool, leaving a grand view of Stern Grove.

Early years Lewis Summers Turner was born on 12 December 1888 in Charleston, Mississippi. He was the first of two children born to Lewis R Turner and Evelyn Mary Summers, both of Mississippi. Turner had one sibling, sister Margaret Evelyn, that was 12 years younger than he. After the death of his father in 1898 his mother remarried to an Attorney named Anselm Helm Jayne and the family moved to Texas. Military While in Texas Turner spent two years in the Militia and worked as a Clerk in the 1st Texas Cavalry of the 36th Division. When the draft went into effect in 1917 Turner was working as an automobile salesman and was married to his first wife. He became a cadet at the School of Military Aeronautics, Air Service in Fort Worth, Texas (2-578-629) and later a 2nd Lieutenant (0-230284) in the United States Army Air Corps Reserve. Turner served from 5 January 1918 until 8 January 1919 and spent all his active duty time in Texas. He was made an Instructor at Carruthers Field, one of three Fort Worth fields at the time and later he was an Instructor for the aviation ground school at the University of Texas. Career Motor cars For a short time before WWI Turner worked as a Machinist in 1916 for the Ford Motor Company in Memphis, Tennessee. Then in 1917 he became a Salesman for Powell Motor Company at the first showroom for Ford's in Vicksburg before going into the service during the war. After getting out of the service Turner went to work as a local sales representative for Palmer Abbott Auto Company of New Orleans, selling Curtiss airplanes before being hired as a pilot. Curtiss airplanes Like many post war aviators Turner continued using his skills to make a living. Turner spent many years as a sales representative for the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company including working for several small locally owned companies across the south central United States. This work caused him to travel and spend a lot of time away from home and his family. Turner was based in places like Vicksburg, Mississippi; New Orleans, Louisiana; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Dallas, Texas supporting the surrounding areas with Curtiss Planes and Plane parts as well as taking people on rides, and acrobatic thrills. Turner also continued to act as an instructor for employers and at times operating his own pilot school. On 4 September 1924 Turner received a wire from his wife in Louisiana that their only child, son Robert, was seriously ill. Turner made the flight from Dallas to Monroe, Louisiana in his Curtiss plane in about 6 hours to be with his son. Robert Howard Turner died within 24 hours of his father‚Äôs arrival. Robert shares a plot with his mother in Arkansas. American Airways inc In 1930 Turner made the move from sales, leaving Garland Aircraft Corporation in Tulsa, and moved to Houston, Texas and full-time piloting. He found work with American Airways in their Southern Airway Division based in San Antonio, Texas. It was while on a routine American Airways flight the evening of 16 March 1933 Turner had to use his skills to save the lives of his passengers and his cargo during a flight incident in which his plane caught fire just after takeoff from Fort Worth en route to Dallas. After the Air Mail Scandal of February 1934 the government cancelled all airmail contracts. American lost its airmail contract and Turner made another move, this time too Long & Harmon, Inc in Dallas. Long & Harmon inc Long & Harmon (L&H;) was awarded a temporary, one-year, contract on 20 April for the airmail route Turner had been flying for American. They had ordered some Ford Trimotor's to increase capacity and be more competitive for the airmail bids that were going to be opened, but they had no multi-engine qualified pilots. Turner, along with Maurice M Kay and George L Hays, were hired to solve this issue due to their multi-engine qualifications. On 1 June 1934 Turner made the inaugural flight of the new Long-Harmon air mail and passenger route connecting Fort Worth and Amarillo with Brownsville and Galveston. They were able to carry more mail, in one of the five L&H; Stinson Reliant monoplanes, than was carried under the old schedule Turner had flown with American Airways before the route suspension on 10 September 1933. The new big tri-motor Fords were put on the schedule 1 October 1934. After receiving their first paycheck Turner and the others noticed they were not being paid as the new law stated they should so Turner contacted friend Dave Behncke, head of the new Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), for help. When notified of the issue H&L; fired the pilots. Barham Oil Drilling After being fired from L&H; Turner found work flying for a small drilling company out of Midland, Texas. George Beverly Barham ran an oil drilling company out of Louisiana that was doing work in the oil fields of west Texas near the panhandle. Barham had a Stinson that Turner piloted for him flying out of Midland, Texas. Pan American Airways inc Turner went to work for Pan American Airways, inc after being illegally fired by L&H.; Pan-Am also had offices in Dallas and during WWII Turner worked as a pilot instructor. With the end of the war Turner transferred to San Antonio, Texas as part of the South American Department where he flew as co-pilot on the route between Brownsville, Texas and Tampico, Mexico. His last flying was done as co-pilot on the route between Brownsville and Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Turner retired in 1948 in failing health and returned to Mississippi. 1937 era Wheaties cereal box cover #5 of 8 in the Airmail Flyers' Medal of Honor series. Flight incident Daily appointment log for FDR showing appointment to present medal to 8 Airmail Flyers On the evening of 16 March 1933 Turner was at the controls of one of the Fairchild 100-A Pilgrim (NC-731 N) aircraft built for American Airways Inc beginning in 1931. The scheduled flight was a trip from Fort Worth Municipal airport to Amarillo via Dallas and on board was the typical load of Airmail as well as two passengers. Merle Brock, another pilot for American Airways, was on board as a passenger being shuttled to Dallas. R Staulter, the Station Manager for American Airways, was also on his way back to Dallas. The flight begin as any other however fire suddenly seemed to engulf the plane from nose to tail when they had only reached an altitude of about 150 feet. Turner immediately banked steeply to return to the field for an emergency landing. The two passengers opened the side compartment door and jumped from the plane before it had come to a stop. Turner opened the top hatch to leave the cockpit but the flames prevented him making his escape. He then opened the cockpit side door and jumped, spraining his ankle due to the height of the jump. Due to the fire around him Turner was unable to use the specially placed footholds for climbing in and out of the cockpit. He ran to get his passengers out, finding they had made their escape he entered the passenger compartment and grabbed the sacks of mail. Shortly after Turner left the plane the gasoline tank in one of the wings exploded. The three men escaped with their lives and were transported to the hospital. Turner left the hospital immediately after burns on his hands were treated. Brock had abrasions on his hands and burns on his neck. Staulter was treated for burns on the face and hands and dislocated shoulder. Brock and Staulter remained in the hospital. The fire damaged the plane badly and partially burned three of the mail pouches, one of which was from Amarillo. Medal from the President 29 October 1935 at a ceremony (12:00 - 12:15) in the White House Turner was one of seven aviators awarded the Airmail Flyers‚Äô Medal of Honor by president Franklin Delano Roosevelt for extraordinary achievement. All seven of the pilots saved the mail in hazardous landings. Present at the ceremony were: President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt; Postmaster General, James A Farley; Lewis S Turner of Fort Worth, Texas; James H Carmichael, Jr. of Detroit, Michigan; Edward A Bellande of Los Angeles, California; Gordon S Darnell of Kansas City, Missouri; Willington P McFail of Murfreesboro, Tennessee; Roy H Warner of Portland, Oregon; And Grover Tyler of Seattle, Washington. Turner's deed was chronicled on the well known Wheaties cereal box cover as part of a series of 8 box covers regarding the feats of pilot's awarded the Air Mail Flyers Medal of Honor. Roosevelt awards the Airmail Flyers Medal of Honor to 7 pilots, with Turner being the third from the left in the photo. Medal citation Later life and death Turner retired from Pan American and flying in February 1948. He spent 31 years of flying, his last being in Honduras for Pan-American. He flew during WWI and was a pilot instructor during WW II with Pan-American. After retirement he suffered from poor health and spent much of his time at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Jackson, Mississippi. He was living with his mother Evelyn Kingston and his sister Marguerite Ford there in Jackson. He had gone to visit his son, Private Lewis Summers Turner, Jr serving at Lackland Air Force Base, and suffered a heart attack dying at his son's home in San Antonio, Texas on 2 January 1951. Turner was interred at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery 5 January 1951.

Background In fluid dynamics and plasma physics, the Clebsch representation provides a means to overcome the difficulties to describe an inviscid flow with non-zero vorticity ‚Äì in the Eulerian reference frame ‚Äì using Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics. At the critical point of such functionals the result is the Euler equations, a set of equations describing the fluid flow. Note that the mentioned difficulties do not arise when describing the flow through a variational principle in the Lagrangian reference frame. In case of surface gravity waves, the Clebsch representation leads to a rotational-flow form of Luke's variational principle. For the Clebsch representation to be possible, the vector field \\\\boldsymbol{v} has (locally) to be bounded, continuous and sufficiently smooth. For global applicability \\\\boldsymbol{v} has to decay fast enough towards infinity. The Clebsch decomposition is not unique, and (two) additional constraints are necessary to uniquely define the Clebsch potentials. Since \\\\psi\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\chi is in general not solenoidal, the Clebsch representation does not in general satisfy the Helmholtz decomposition.

He is also known in the sports world as founder (in 1971) of Ride and Tie, a conversion to racing of a historic means of transportation for two individuals who had only one horse and needed to travel a long distance. Early life and education Raised in a series of small Michigan towns, Johns began his newspaper career as a regional correspondent for the daily Flint Journal and weekly Flushing Observer. While still in high school he moved to Flint and worked at the Flint Sporting Digest and then the Journal. He enrolled at Albion College with a down payment of one-third of his first semester's tuition and worked his way 100 per cent as a reporter for the Albion Evening Recorder, weekly sports columnist for the Journal and its fellow Booth Michigan Newspapers, waiting tables for his meals and officiating high school football and basketball games. Albion named him a Distinguished Alumnus in 1999. Career After graduating from college Johns served in the Marine Corps from 1951-1953, reaching the rank of staff sergeant. During that time he participated in a 1952 A-bomb test with troops who double timed to ground zero without protective gear 2000 meters from their fox holes. In 1953 Johns was a reporter for the Flint Journal as a reporter mainly covering politics. He left the Journal for a brief stint as a reporter for the San Diego Union, joining New York-based Fairchild Publications in 1960 and becoming its San Francisco bureau chief the next year. He went to Levi Strauss & Co.as public relations director in 196y9, became director of corporate communications the next year. He was later elected corporate vice president . He retired from the company in 1984. During the years 1976 to 1981 Johns was responsible for annual conferences sponsored by Levi Strauss & Co. at the Sun Valley (ID) Center for the Arts and Institute of the American Institute. Ride and Tie In 1971 Johns founded, with Levi's sponsorship, the sport of Ride and Tie.\\" Johns had been charged by the Company with finding a \\"a distinctive sports event\\" for Levis to sponsor. He recalled having read about the old-fashioned custom of two people sharing a single horse on a journey by alternately riding and tying the horse where the other person could come up to it an mount, turn by turn, years before beginning to work for Levi Strauss & Co. Johns first heard such a story while researching the history of Pine Valley, California to promote it on behalf of a real estate developer. An article in the July 23, 1933 issue of the San Diego Union told of a Pine Valley father and son, Charles Emery and his father, William, who set out in 1873 to track down and catch a band of horse thieves who had stolen 14 of their horses. Unfortunately, father and son made the mistake of leaving one of their mounts behind. Determined not to lose the thieves, they pursued them ride-and-tie style - traveling 40 miles a day until they reached Mexico where they found the thieves and were able to reclaim 7 of the stolen horses. Father and son then watched as the Mexican Army executed the horse thieves.he and his California rancher father had used their one remaining horse to go to Mexico to get the horses taken by rustlers who had subsequently been captured and shot. (Ride & Tie: The Challenge of Running and Riding, Don Jacobs, 1978.) Johns thought that Ride and tie was a perfect fit for the image Levi Strauss was trying to project. By the time of the first race, with 64 teams running and riding 25 miles over California's Mayacamus Mountains between the Napa and Sonoma valleys, Johns had learned that ride and tie's transportation history was even older. In England, in March 1737, Dr. Samuel Johnson and his student David Garrick (later to become the noted actor) had traveled that way 120 miles to London because they had only enough money to rent one horse and stay one night in an inn. (Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson). In 1742 Henry Fielding's novel History of Joseph Andrews concluded a chapter about the ride and tie journey of two travelers with ‚Äú...and that is that method of traveling so much in use among our prudent ancestors.‚Äù In addition to his primary corporate communications responsibilities ‚Äì media relations, company publications, product publicity and involvement with investment relations ‚Äì Johns directed the championship race its first 14 years and advocated establishment of the event elsewhere. In 1983 there were an estimated 350 R&T; races in the U.S. and abroad. That year on three successive weekends, while in Europe on company business, Johns attended the 1st annual Swiss championship, the 3rd annual German championship and the 5th annual English championship. On his return to the U.S. he directed the ‚ÄúLevi's‚Äù at Eureka, CA, with a field of 198 teams. After 1987 Levi Strauss transferred responsibility for the championship and its promotion to the non-profit Ride & Tie Association. Publishing and writing career Johns publishing career began in 1954 when he and his Flint Journal colleague William D. Chase co-founded Apple Tree Press to publish George Bernard Shaw's Last Will and Testament as a book. (Saturday Review (March 27, 1954) and The Book Club of California Quarterly. Fall 2004). Johns transferred his interest in Apple Tree to Chase who continued it with his brother to publish the annual Chases' Calendar of Annual Events: Special Days, Weeks and Months which is now a part of McGraw-Hill Publishing. In 1968 Johns founded Synergistic Press which has published an eclectic list focusing on non-fiction including biography and art subjects. He was a director and part owner of Applewood Books, New Bedford, MA. He produced and wrote the script for a half-hour television film on Ride & Tie and was executive producer of \\"The Best They Can Be,\\" a Clio award-winning television program on athletes striving to participate in the 1980 Summer Olympics. As freelancer Johns wrote numerous magazine and newspaper articles. His books include The Ombibulous Mr. Mencken 1968, What Is This Madness? (1985), co- editing and writing the biographical introduction to Bastard in the Ragged Suit (1977) editing, writing the introduction to and one essay in Old Dogs Remembered, published in hardcover by Carroll & Graf, New York, in 1983, and paperback by Synergistic Press in 1999 (1993). Civic participation During the years 1976 to 1981 Johns was responsible for annual conferences sponsored by Levi Strauss & Co. at the Sun Valley (ID) Center for the Arts and Institute of the American West on themes such as Western Movies: Myth or Reality?, The Writers and the West, and That Awesome Space (environmental issues). Board memberships include the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area‚Äôs Greenbelt Alliance (formerly People for Open Space), San Francisco, 1982-2004 (President 1990-1994); Documentary Research, Inc., Buffalo, NY (1978‚Äì1990); San Francisco Contemporary Music Players (1981‚Äì2004), President, 1996-1998; Stern Grove Festival Association, San Francisco (1970‚Äì1981); Rodeo Advisory Committee of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, Colorado Springs, CO (1969‚Äì1981); Western States Trails Foundation (1987-1988); and Tamarind Institute of Lithography, University of New Mexico. He was a member of the National Council of the Museum of the American Indian, New York City, 1980-1981. Johns and his wife, Fran Moreland Johns, were generous donors of art from their collection to Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art. Personal life Johns was married to the artist Judith Spector Clancy whose drawings of architectural notable buildings were widely published in magazines, from 1971 until her death in 1990. In 1992 he married Frances Moreland, a writer whose professional name is Fran Moreland Johns.

He served as a minister in the governments of Henry Lefroy and Hal Colebatch. Early life Hudson was born in Geelong, Victoria, to Annie (n√©e Nicholson) and Charles George Hudson. He left school at the age of 12, working as a printer's devil, and eventually began training as a lawyer. Hudson was admitted to the Victorian bar in 1892, and subsequently worked in various country towns, including Shepparton, Morwell, Victoria, Traralgon, and Terang. He moved to Western Australia in the early 1900s, and began practising at Norseman on the Eastern Goldfields.Charles Arthur Hudson ‚Äì Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 11 January 2017. Politics Hudson entered parliament at the 1905 state election, winning the seat of Dundas for the Labor Party. He was re-elected in 1908, but prior to the 1911 election decided to transfer to the neighbouring seat of Yilgarn. Hudson defeated the sitting member, Austin Horan, for Labor preselection, and also defeated Horan (standing as an independent) in the general election. He was re-elected in 1914, to what was considered a safe Labor seat. After the Labor Party split of 1916, Hudson joined the National Labor Party. He was made a minister without portfolio when Henry Lefroy became premier in June 1917, and the following month replaced John Scaddan (another Labor defector) as Minister for Mines and Minister for Railways, following Scaddan's defeat at a ministerial by-election. In April 1919, when Lefroy was replaced as premier by Hal Colebatch, Hudson was retained in the ministry and became Colonial Secretary. However, he served in the position for only a month, as Colebatch was quickly replaced by James Mitchell (who did not keep him on as a minister). Hudson lost his seat to Edwin Corboy of the Labor Party at the 1921 state election. Later life After leaving parliament, Hudson practised law at Albany for a period, and then moved to Perth. He was confined to a nursing home in Subiaco for the last years of his life, dying there in 1937, aged 70. Hudson had married Jane Ellen Wiggins in 1892, although they had no children.

It inhabits seashores in southern Africa and on some oceanic islands. Description D. echinata is distinguished by a pair of long curved \\"horns\\" situated on the back of each segment of the thorax. These horns are substantially longer in males than in females. Horn length in males has been found to be correlated with body condition, and it is hypothesized that this sexual dimorphism acts as an indicator of overall fitness and is the result of sexual selection. Colouration is dark brown on the back, lighter brown in patches, underneath and on the extremities. Males have an average length of 30 mm, females of 22 mm, making the species one of the largest in the suborder. Distribution The species occurs on the coast of southern Africa, having been recorded in Namibia, South Africa and Mozambique. It can also be found on √éle Amsterdam and √éle Saint-Paul in the southern Indian Ocean. It inhabits the intertidal zone, where it occurs on or under rocks, generally associated with kelp and other organic drift material. Ecology D. echinata is placed in the suborder Oniscidea, the woodlice, a group of crustaceans that is adapted to terrestrial rather than aquatic habitats. The species spends its life on shore, feeding mainly on drift algae and other washed-up plant material but also on carrion and small live prey. Where their ranges overlap in western South Africa, individuals are commonly mixed in with groups of the generally much more numerous, distantly related Ligia dilatata.

Essentially, global supply chain- management is the same as supply-chain management, but it focuses on companies and organizations that are trans-national. Global supply-chain management has six main areas of concentration: logistics management, competitor orientation, customer orientation, supply-chain coordination, supply management, and operations management. These six areas of concentration can be divided into four main areas: marketing, logistics, supply management, and operations management. Successful management of a global supply chain also requires complying with various international regulations set by a variety of non- governmental organizations (e.g. The United Nations). Global supply-chain management can be impacted by several factors who impose policies that regulate certain aspects of supply chains. Governmental and non-governmental organizations play a key role in the field as they create and enforce laws or regulations which companies must abide by. These regulatory policies often regulate social issues that pertain to the implementation and operation of a global supply chain (e.g. labour, environmental, etc.). These regulatory policies force companies to obey the regulations set in place which often impact a company's profit. Operating and managing a global supply chain comes with several risks. These risks can be divided into two main categories: supply-side risk and demand side risk. Supply-side risk is a category that includes risks accompanied by the availability of raw materials which effects the ability of the company to satisfy customer demands. Demand-side risk is a category that includes risks that pertain to the availability of the finished product. Depending on the supply chain, a manager may choose to minimize or take on these risks. Successful global supply-chain management occurs after implementing the appropriate framework of concentration, complying with international regulations set by governments and non-governmental organizations, and recognizing and appropriately handling the risks involved while maximizing profit and minimizing waste.  Areas of concentration   Marketing  Marketing should be emphasized by global supply chain managers to create customer value, satisfaction, and loyalty. Customer value, satisfaction, and loyalty lead to improved profit margins, which in turn leads to overall corporate growth. Managers need to think about their strategies and the implication of the strategy on the entire supply chain. One market strategy that is commonly used among businesses with global supply chains is the customer perspective strategy. Taking a customer perspective towards marketing strategy means focusing mainly on customers. This perspective focuses on understanding the complexity of customer values. This perspective involves understanding and how a customer defines and develops their values. By understanding how a customer sets their values, a company is able to make changes to appeal to the customer base's values which in turn leads to greater profit. There are four common and critical challenges that managers face when attempting to design and implement a marketing strategy that best relates to customer values. The first issue that managers face is the challenge of understanding exactly what customers value in a global supply chain. Understanding customer values in a global supply chain focuses on the task of identifying what supply streams customers value most. The second challenge is having to understand the constant changes in customer values throughout global supply chains. Since customers are constantly changing what they value, staying ahead of the trend and attempting to predict changing values is increasingly difficult. The third challenge is having to deliver values in a new environment that has never seen this level of marketplace. The global market is becoming increasingly prevalent which companies are taking advantage of, therefore the challenge of attempting to deliver values in a country/region that has never been exposed to a marketplace such as this before arises. The final challenge is creating and staying committed to the solutions designed to address these issues. Solutions to these challenges are implemented and it is a challenge within itself to stick to these solutions especially as businesses have increased emphasis on cost reduction efforts.  Logistics  When managing a global supply chain, it is important to place emphasis on logistics performance as there has been an increase in business-to-business international marketing. Logistics is inherently difficult and complex for a global supply chain as it deals with trade regulations, shipping distances, and cross-currency issues. Companies and/or organizations who place an emphasis on logistics management can find themselves with a serious competitive advantage as it has a clear visible impact on customers. Focusing on customer preferences when implementing and managing a companies logistic services has proven to provide the organization with several benefits. One of the major benefits is cost reduction. Costs can be reduced if the company identifies all the necessary logistic segments and then eliminates unnecessary and redundant. Customizing logistics not only reduces cost, but it also increases revenue by appealing to the customer base which in turn stays loyal to the business. To stay competitive, organizations need to develop global logistic strategies that appropriately and effectively appeal to the customer's needs. By doing this, companies are able to take advantage of the increasingly profitable global market.  Supply management  Supply management deals with the development and management of the critical business and supplier relationship. As the market becomes progressively global, the strategy of outsourcing suppliers has increasingly used. Outsourcing suppliers has several benefits for a business if they can effectively develop the relationship.  Management theories   The 21st- century logistics framework  The 21st-century logistics framework is a global supply-chain management theory that was developed at Michigan State University and was introduced to the business world in 1999. The framework identifies six business competencies that are necessary to operate a global supply chain. There are multiple underlying capabilities for each competency which influence management decisions. The six competencies are: customer integration, internal integration, material/service supplier integration, technology and planning integration, measurement integration, and relationship integration. The capabilities that are attached the competency of customer integration are: segmental focus, relevancy, responsiveness, and flexibility. Segmental focus refers to the ability to develop customer aimed programs that are specifically designed to achieve maximum customer success. Relevancy refers to the ability to maintain and modify customer focuses to reflect the constant changing expectations. Responsiveness refers to the ability to accommodate unique and unforeseen customer requests/requirements. Flexibility refers to the ability to appropriately adapt to any unexpected circumstance. Cross-functional unification, standardization, simplification, and compliance are the underlying capabilities that are associated with the internal integration competency. Cross-functional unification refers to the ability to put potential co-operative activities into manageable operational processes. Standardization refers to the ability to implement policies/procedures that address any concurrent operations. Simplification refers to the ability to identify, adopt, implement, and improve the best possible business practices. Compliance refers to the ability to follow any established policies. The capabilities that are related to material/service supplier integration are: strategic alignment, operational fusion, financial linkage, and supplier management. The ability to develop a corporate culture or common vision that create a shared responsibility is defined as strategic alignment. The ability to fuse systems together to reduce redundancy is defined as operational fusion. Financial linkage refers to ability to join financial ventures with suppliers to achieve common goals. Supplier management refers to the ability to extend management to include the hierarchical structure of suppliers. Information management, internal communication, connectivity, and collaborative forecasting and planning are the capabilities that encompassed by technology and planning integration. The ability to use seamless transactions across the entire chain to allocate resources throughout the chain is called information management. Internal communication refers to the ability to communicate within the business in appropriate manner. The ability to communicate and exchange information between the business and the external supply chain partner is called connectivity. Collaborative forecasting and planning refers to the ability to collaborate with customers to identify and develop shared visions. The capabilities that underlie measurement integration are: functional assessment, comprehensive metrics, and financial impact. Functional assessment refers to the ability to develop and implement an appropriate performance measurement tool. Comprehensive metrics refers to the ability to implement cross-business performance standards. Financial impact refers to the direct link between overall supply chain performance and the results of the financial measurement. The capabilities that underlie relationship integration are: role specificity, guidelines, information sharing, and gain/risk sharing. Role specificity refers to the ability to clearly define leadership and establish a set of shared and individual responsibilities. Guidelines refers to the ability to create and implement policies/rules that govern everyday interactions. Information sharing refers to the willingness to share important information (often including financial, technical, or strategic information) throughout the supply chain. Gain/risk sharing refers to the appropriately divide and allocate rewards/penalties. The 21st-century logistics framework allows managers to identify and implement the most important underlying capabilities that are encompassed in the six business competencies. The framework gives managers the freedom to decide what they believe to be the most important capabilities that need to be implemented to run a successful global supply chain.  Human collaboration theory  The human collaboration theory suggests that there is strong evidence to prove that investment in supply-chain management have the largest impacts when they focus on enabling supply chain collaboration. This management theory focuses on the managers ability to invest in and promote human collaboration between employees throughout the global supply chain. Human collaboration is defined as the use of skills through harmonization of individuals, teams and organizations to achieve greater things not achievable by an individual person. The human collaboration theory/framework lays out four key components. The first component deals with the forces that drive change, the second focuses on people-technology-process assets that create network collaboration, the third deals with resisting forces which encourage people to resist collaboration, and the fourth component looks at the desired collaboration performance. The theory states that to implement and operate a successful global supply chain, a manager must understand and use these components. The theory states that to implement and operate the best collaboration system, a manager must; build trust between the different players of the chain (supplier and manufacturer), establish a culture which supports decision making and work, implement a proper reward system, and use synergistic activities. According to the theories creators, a manager must follow four steps to transform their network into a more collaborative network. The first step is to recognize that to be competitive the company will require innovations which can be proposed by people outside the corporate boundary and therefore to access these people they need to be more collaborative with external partners. They then must alter their views of achieving collaboration by acknowledging the different types of collaboration (transactional, co-operative, coordinated, synchronized). Next, a manager must develop a collaborative plan that achieve the goals he/she sets out to achieve. Finally a manager must develop the right controls to ensure the goals/mission can be met. If a manager follows the recommendations made by this theory, then they will have implemented a proper global supply chain that focuses on human collaboration which in turn will yield better results.  International regulations   Role of government  Governments can play a large role in regulating certain aspects of a global supply chains. Governments have a wide range of policy instruments that they can use to implement regulations. These instruments include but are not limited to: taxation, financial incentives, regulation, liberalization, infrastructure, land use planning, and advice and exhortation. However, before designing and implementing a regulation, it is important for governments to properly analyze any second-order effects that might occur. Second order effects are defined as the offsetting effects that happen elsewhere because of the implementation of a policy. Recently, there has been a steady incline of governments creating and implementing regulations to promote green supply chains. To design and implement the appropriate government's need to take into account the five aspects of sustainable logistics. The first is reducing freight transport intensity as it is becoming necessary for governments to introduce explicit policies to encourage companies to reduce the amount of freight movement within their system. The second aspect is freight modal split, which the author describes as shifting freight to greener transport modes. Governments can promote this by using policy instruments (usually taxation, financial incentives, regulation, and infrastructural measures). The third aspect is vehicle use which governments must attempt to promote companies to improve their use of road freight. This can be done through taxation, regulation, liberalization, and advice committees. The fourth aspect is increasing energy efficiency which often is seen with the introduction of general efficiency programs. Governments can raise fuel duty, subsidize driver training schemes, reduce and enforce speed limits, impose fuel economy standards, incentivize scrappage of old vehicles and give advice to promote a higher standard of energy efficiency. The fifth and final aspect is cutting emissions relative to energy use which needs to be addressed through a policy.  Role of the United Nations  The United Nations plays a big role in designing and implementing international regulations that have huge impacts on the operation and management of global supply chains. The United Nations created the UN Global Compact which is an organization that aims to mobilize a global movement of sustainable companies and stakeholders. The UN Global Compact attempts to mobilize a global movement by supporting companies to be responsible and to advance societal goals. The organization has created a set of ten principles which they expect companies to abide by. The ten principles fall under the broader categories of human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption. With regards to human rights the organization encourages businesses to support and respect human rights, and make sure they are not abusing any established human rights laws. The labour principles deal with the recognition of collective bargaining, elimination of forced labour, abolition of child labour, and elimination of discrimination. The environment principles focus on being cautious to environmental challenges, promoting greater environmental responsibility, and encouraging the development of environmentally friendly technologies. The anti-corruption principle states that businesses should work against corruption. They have published two guides which illustrate how businesses can implement the ten principles throughout their supply chains and integrate sustainability. These guides state that companies can achieve supply-chain sustainability by taking certain steps which include: committing, defining, implementing, assessing, measuring, and communicating to effectively become sustainable.  Risks of operation   Supply-side risk  Supply-side risk is a category that includes risks accompanied by the availability of raw materials which effects the ability of the company to satisfy customer demands. Several issues can arise from operating a global supply chain. Common supply side risks are often the fact that it takes a long time to receive products from around the world, and suppliers may not necessarily operate to the same quality standards. Outsourcing suppliers may provide a business several benefits but a lot of risk comes attached to it. One major risk is the fact that global currencies are constantly changing, a small change in foreign currency could have a large impact on the overall profit a business receives. Supplier order processing time variability is another supply-side risk that comes increasingly risky when outsourcing suppliers. This risk is defined by the fact that the time it takes a supplier to fulfill an order can change for every order. Businesses are not exactly sure how the supplier is going to deal with the order and whether they will be able to deliver products on time.  Demand-side risk  Demand-side risk is a category that includes risks that pertain to the availability of the finished product. Demand-side risks mainly occur when companies are unable to deal with the demands of the customer base.

Soon after meetings were held in order to facilitate the expansion of the Cultural Revolution in Tibet and in August 1966 students began to form the Tibetan branch of the Red Guards.  The Red Guards in Tibet  On August 8, 1966, the decision was issued to start the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The Red Guards were dispersed throughout China, at this time Tibet formed their own Red Guard in Lhasa. This began the Cultural Revolutions destruction of Tibetan prayer flags, religious art, and sacred texts. In September 1966, Red Guards from Xianyang and Beijing began to arrive in Lhasa. These guards came from the Tibetan Nationality Institute and joined with local Red Guards to intensify the campaign against the \\"four olds\\" and class enemies. Public \\"struggle sessions\\" were held by the Red Guards against \\"reactionaries\\" or \\"capitalists\\", in which people were beaten, and publicly shamed. Zhang Guohua and the Regional Party Committee wanted to minimize the Red Guards' access and criticism of the party leaders. On September 19, 1966, The Red Guards created and distributed big character posters that openly advocated the bombardment of the Regional Party Committee to many counties in Tibet. In November 1966 there was a citywide debate hosted by ten revolutionary organizations; this was to decide whether the Regional Party Committee had been \\"implementing a bourgeois reactionary line\\". This in turn divided Lhasa into two factions, both who claimed to be true followers of Mao Zedong, Gyenlo and Nyamdre. The State Council in Beijing once again gave instructions that banned the exchange of revolutionary experiences in Tibet, this was ignored. On December 4, 1966, the State Council announced regulations requiring the Red Guards, who were still in Lhasa, to leave Tibet and return to their own localities by December 20. Beijing Red Guards in Lhasa were given permission to stay by the Central Cultural Revolution Group, headed by, Jiang Qing. Red Guards ousted party leaders and took over their positions. In 1968, Mao sent People's Liberation Army troops into Tibet to gain control. This resulted in a series of public executions. In 1969, the People's Liberation Army disarmed the Red Guards all across China.  Birth of the Tibetan Red Guards  From June 15 to July 5, 1966, the Regional Party Committee under the leadership of Zhang Guohua held meetings to decide how to implement the Cultural Revolution in Tibet. This meeting was used to figure out how the Regional Party Committee, not the local Red Guards or other revolutionary workers and cadres, could control the events to come. The solution to this was for the committee to decide among themselves who was to be sacrificed as a \\"capitalist roader\\" or reactionary. Those that were chosen were to be singled out and criticized by the masses. In August 1966 students and teachers at the Lhasa Middle School and the Tibetan Teacher's College began to organize their own Red Guard organization.  Beijing Red Guards  In September 1966 Red Guards from the Tibetan Nationality Institute in Xianyang and Beijing began to arrive in Lhasa. Red Guards were encouraged to travel all over China to spread Mao's thinking and to ensure the \\"four olds\\" were being eradicated everywhere. With the arrival of the new Red Guards, the campaign against all thing capitalistic intensified. This began the power struggle between the Regional Party Committee and the Red Guards. Zhang Guohua was granted an order by Zhou Enlai to keep more Han Red Guards from Beijing and other areas from coming to Tibet. This order was ignored and in November 1966 three groups of metropolitan Red Guards arrived in Tibet. With the arrival of the new Red Guards the focus was directly on the party leaders.  Destroying the Four Olds  Many temples in Tibet were destroyed prior to the Cultural Revolution. The temples and monasteries that were left became targets for the Red Guards. In September 1966, Jokhang Temple was destroyed. Red Guards used dynamite and artillery on many of these temples and monasteries, therefore reducing them to rubble. Libraries were also looted, and rare books, Buddhist scripture, and paintings were burned. This was done in private homes as well as the temples and monasteries. Monks could no longer wear their traditional robes but were made to wear blue Mao suits instead.  Gyenlo and Nyamdre  Two factions were formed by the Red Guards in Tibet. These two factions each felt they were the true followers of Mao Zedong. The differences in these two factions steamed from whether the Regional Party Committee had been \\"implementing a bourgeois reactionary line\\" or the \\"proletarian revolutionary line\\". The Gyenlo faction published leaflets and publications that spelled out their commitment to rebel against the party leadership. On December 28, in response of Gyenlo, mass organizations that were supportive of the Regional Party Committee joined together to establish the headquarters of Defending Mao Zedong's Thoughts or \\"Headquarters of Defending\\" for short. In February 1967, this became the Nyamdre. From May until December 1967 the disagreements between the two factions, Gyenlo and Nyamdre, escalated. The two factions fought armed battles in the streets of Lhasa. References  Bibliography  Dreyer, J.

Located in the city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ on Bracka Street, the necropolis was opened in 1892 and occupies around 44 hectares of land. The cemetery contains from 180,000 to 230,000 marked graves, as well as mass graves of victims of the Litzmannstadt Ghetto and the Holocaust. From 1893 to 1896, the basic construction of the necropolis was completed under the supervision of well-known architect Adolf Zeligson. The circular access is provided by the gate from the southern side on the axis of Abram Cukier Street, which is an extension Chryzantem Street. Pedestrian access is possible from the east through a gate in the wall stretching along Zmienna Street. The composition of the foundation is based on the arrangement of two mutually perpendicular axes. The first one leads from the main gate to the square in front of the pre-funeral house. Alongside it, there were once buildings associated with the functioning of the necropolis, in addition to the pre-burial house, this complex included a synagogue, a residential house for cemetery service, a water tower, a mikveh and other minor construction facilities. Today over a hundred of historical gravesites have been declared historical monuments and are in various stages of restoration. The mausoleum of Izrael Pozna≈Ñski is perhaps the largest Jewish tombstone in the world and the only one containing decorative mosaic. The cemetery continues to function as a Jewish burial site. History The cemetery was established on Bracka and Zmienna Streets and following its creation in 1892, it was the largest Jewish necropolis in the Europe. The decision was made to established a Jewish gravesite when residents of the surrounding neighbourhoods refused to allow the expansion of the old cemetery on Weso≈Ça Street, which contained over 3,000 graves. An influential industrialist and factory owner Izrael Pozna≈Ñski donated the first 10.5 hectares of land towards the cemetery's establishment. The outbreak of a cholera epidemic in 1892 forced the Tsarist authorities of Congress Poland to accept the construction. Thus, the first people buried there in the winter of 1892 were approximately 700 cholera victims. In 1893, an estimated 1,139 men and women were buried at the new cemetery. The Beit Tahara (Funeral Home) was funded by Mina Dobrzy≈Ñska Konsztat in 1896 and completed in 1898. In 1900, Albert Cukier purchased additional acres of land and greatly expanded the necropolis. During this time, several houses for cemetery workers and a wooden synagogue were built. World War I brought severe destruction and many tombstones were badly damaged. Its renovation was supported financially by city's industrialists. By 1925, the original wooden fence surrounding the cemetery's borders was replaced by a red brick wall that still stands to this day. All tombstones in the cemetery face east and in the 19th century the majority of them were painted in different colours.

Some traditional regional preparations of the dish exist, such as Coniglio all'ischitana on the island of Ischia, German Hasenpfeffer and jugged hare in Great Britain and France. Hare stew dates back to at least the 14th century, and was published in The Forme of Cury during this time as a recipe for stewed hare. Rabbit stew is a traditional dish of the Algonquin people, is the national dish of Malta and is also a part of the cuisine of the Greek islands. Hare stew was commercially manufactured and canned circa the early 1900s in western France and eastern Germany. Overview alt=Some rabbit stew ingredients Rabbit stew is prepared using rabbit meat as a primary ingredient. Additional ingredients can include potato, carrot, onion, celery, garlic, wine and various herbs and spices. The rabbit can be marinated in a liquid, such as red wine, prior to cooking. The blood of the hare or rabbit has historically been used in some preparations of hare stew and rabbit stew to thicken and enrich it, and this practice is sometimes used in contemporary preparations. A more recent example of this is in England (circa the 1910s and prior to this time), whereby the blood was sometimes used to enrich hare stew. Varieties Conejo en salmorejo is a very common rabbit stew dish in the Canary Islands prepared using marinated rabbit. Ingredients used in the marinade include wine, olive oil, cumin, garlic and various herbs, and it as an aromatic dish. It is sometimes served accompanied with Canarian wrinkly potatoes. Coniglio all'ischitana is a traditional rabbit stew dish on the island of Ischia, which located off of the coast of Naples, Italy. Ingredients in Coniglio all'ischitana include rabbit, tomato, white wine, garlic, chili pepper and herbs such as rosemary, thyme, marjoram and basil. Fenkata is a traditional Maltese communal meal and feast prepared using rabbit in various dishes, and may include stuffat tal-fenek, a rabbit stew, served atop spaghetti. Hasenpfeffer is a traditional stew in German cuisine prepared using hare or rabbit as a primary ingredient. Some preparation variations exist, but the blood of the hare or rabbit is traditionally used, which serves to thicken the stew. It is typically a very flavorful and delicious stew. Jugged hare and jugged rabbit are dishes that involves stewing an entire hare or rabbit that has been cut at the joints in a process called jugging. The blood of the hare or rabbit is traditionally included in jugged hare, which serves to thicken and enrich the dish. Additional ingredients in both dishes include typical stew ingredients such as vegetables and spices. Wine, such as Port, and juniper berries are used in jugged hare. Jugged hare is a traditional dish in Great Britain and France, and used to be a staple food in Great Britain. Jugged hare is included in early editions of the book The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy. The book was first published in 1747. History alt=Rabbit stew with carrot and celery A stewed hare dish is included in The Forme of Cury, a book of English recipes published in the 14th century. The recipe therein called for the use of noodles in the dish, with an option to use wafers or oblatas in place of noodles. Both hare stew and rabbit stew are included in Le Viandier de Taillevent, a recipe collection with an initial publishing dated to circa 1300. It is unclear when these recipes first appeared in the cookbook, which was published in 24 editions. The hare stew recipe therein calls for the dish to be black in color, whereas the recipe for rabbit stew calls for it to be a bit lighter in color compared to the hare stew. Hare stew is included in volume 2 of Le M√©nagier de Paris, which was first published in print form by Baron J√©r√¥me Pichon in 1846. This recipe called for the use of several spices, including ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, grain of paradise, cloves and pepper, or other exotic spices. These spices were expensive during this time. Rabbit stew is a traditional dish of the Algonquin people, an indigenous people of North America. Rabbit stew has been described as a \\"kind of national dish in Crete\\", Greece, and is also prepared on the Greek island of Icaria, where hares and partridges comprise the primary game meats available. Circa the early 1900s in eastern France and western Germany, hare stew was commercially-prepared and canned by various packers. Circa the early 1900s in the United States, rabbit stew was prepared using domestic or wild rabbits.

The Three Pillars of Sustainability Cultural sustainability as it relates to sustainable development (to sustainability), has to do with the maintaining of cultural beliefs, cultural practices, heritage conservation, culture as its own entity, and attempts to answer the question of whether or not any given cultures will exist in the context of the future. Culture is defined as a set of beliefs, morals, methods, and a collection of human knowledge that is dependent on the transmission of these characteristics to younger generations. Sustainability is defined as the ability to sustain or continue. The two concepts have been intertwined within social and political domains, and as such, have become one of the more important concepts of sustainability. First mentioned in 1995, cultural sustainability also proposed viable options in the field of social policy, providing solutions to sustainable development issues. Cultural Sustainability can be regarded as a fundamental issue, even a precondition to be met on the path towards sustainable development. However, the theoretical and conceptual understanding of cultural sustainability within the general frames of Sustainable Development remains vague and consequently, the role of culture is poorly implemented in the environmental, as well as political and social policy. Determining the impact of Cultural Sustainability is found by investigating the concept of culture in the context of Sustainable development, through multidisciplinary approaches and analyses. This means examining the best practices for bringing culture into political and social policy as well as practical domains, and developing means and indicators for assessing the impacts of culture on Sustainable Development. Cultural sustainability has always been categorized under the social pillar of the three pillars of sustainability, but with recent developments within this field considerations are being made in order to make Cultural Sustainability its own pillar, due to its growing importance within social, political, environmental, and economic spheres. The importance of cultural sustainability lies within its influential power over the people, as decisions that are made within the context of society are heavily weighed by the beliefs of that society.  Sociopolitical landscapes  Culture has an overwhelming effect on social, economic and political planning, but as of yet, has failed to be incorporated into social and political policy on a grand scale, however, certain policies regarding both policy and politics have managed to be implemented into some conventions that are implemented on a global scale. Culture is found everywhere within a society, from the relics of previous generations, to the accumulated values of a society. Culture within society can be divided into two, equally important subtopics that aid in the description of cultural specific characterizations. These categories, as defined by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are \\"Material\\" and \\"Immaterial\\". Material objects such as shrines, paintings, buildings, landscapes and other humanistic formations act as a physical representation of the culture in that area. Although they have little social and political utility, they serve as physical landmarks and culturally dependent objects whose meaning is created and maintained within the context of that society. The accumulation of these cultural characteristics are what measures a society's cultural integrity, and these characteristics are inherently capable of transforming landscapes of political, social and environment nature via the influence that these values and historical remains have on the population. Little success has come with the implementations of cultural policy within the context of politics due to a lack of empirical information regarding the topic of cultural sustainability. The Immaterial category contains more socially and politically applicable characteristics such as practices, traditions, aesthetics, knowledge, expressions etc. These characteristics embody social and political utility through education of people, housing, social justice, human rights, employment and more. These values contribute to the well-being of a society through the use of collective thinking and ideals i.e. culture. Culture also presents more room for expansion on its effects on a society. Specifically, creativity, respect, empathy, and other practices are being used to create social integration and also to create a sense of \\"self\\" in the world.  Convention implementation  Implementation of policy on a global scale has had little success, but enough to show an increasing interest in the topic of Cultural Sustainability. The conventions that have been implemented, have done so on a large scale, involving multiple countries, across most continents. UNESCO has been responsible for the vast majority of these conventions, maintaining that cultural sustainability and cultural heritage are a strong cornerstone of society. One of the more relevant conventions created in 2003 is the \\"Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage\\" which proclaims that culture must be protected against all adversarial combatants. This safeguard was implemented as an understanding that culture guarantees sustainability. Implementing policy based on cultural history is in the process of becoming a widely talked about subject and holds that cultures will be able to thrive in the context of both present and future. Conventions made by UNESCO regarding cultural preservation and sustainability are surrounding the promotion of cultural diversity, which means multiple cultures and ideals within one grand culture.  Cultural heritage  Cultural memorabilia and artifacts from a cultures history maintain an important role in modern society as they are kept as relics and shrines in order to remember the stories, knowledge, skills and methods of ancestors and learn invaluable lessons from the past. Today, cultures use libraries, art exhibits and museums as a placeholder for these important objects and other culturally significant artifacts. Not only are these objects revered, but the buildings themselves are oftentimes a symbol of cultural integrity to the community which it belongs. Linking with the other pillars of sustainability, the biggest barrier to cultural sustainability is funding. Economic sustainability relies on a number of systems with goals to ensure economic prosperity by eliminating spending where it is not needed. Cultural buildings such as museums oftentimes fail to receive the funding it needs to continue the preservation of culturally significant artifacts.  Sustainable tourism  Tourism is a traveling method for which people can venture to different areas of the globe and experience new ways of living, and explore landscapes not native to their country of origin. Tourism is constantly being criticized for its impact on the social, political and environmental landscapes due to its high volume of mass consumers. Within the realm of tourism exists more sustainable practices and ideals that are aligned with the idea of cultural sustainability.  Geotourism  thumb Geotourism is a form of tourism which relies heavily upon the sustainability, or even the improvement of a selected geological location. Serving as an alternative to mass tourism, Geotourism was created with the purpose of aiding in the sustainable development movement. Geotourism is a method which focuses on Sustainable culture, ecological preservation and restoration, welfare of local populous, and the wildlife in the immediate area. The link between Geotourism and Cultural sustainability lies within their role in maintaining the natural state of the environment, including the social and cultural environment. Preservation of the local culture has been a key element of Geotourism from its inception, and due to this form of tourism, travelers are able to experience true local culture, lifestyles, and practices experienced by the people native to that region. This form of tourism provides education regarding destinations they have traveled to via ethnographic methods, and also calls upon the traveler to become aware of the footprint they leave on the environment, as well as social changes that may be harmful to the indigenous peoples. Responsibility plays an important role in Geotourism by informing travelers of their duties to respect, and preserve the local culture. Many countries have adapted this method of tourism, going as far as to implement geotourism sites equipped with guides that discuss matters of importance in that area such as environmental or cultural concerns. Such countries include: * Many states within the U.S.A. including California & Arizona * Romania * Norway * Honduras Geotourism in Honduras includes The Bay Islands, a Caribbean archipelago made up of three main islands, Utila, Roatan, and Guanaja and a few lesser islands and cays located off the north coast of Honduras. These islands have been blessed with stunning natural scenery, highlighted by idyllic beaches, tropical hillsides, and mangrove forests. https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1025_041025_travelwatch.html * Mexico Geotourism in Mexico includes Puerto Pe√±asco. This region includes the protected Sea of Cortez, the Pinacate Crator which offers barren deserts, sacred tribal and Indian lands, fishing zones, estuaries, oyster beds, and vibrant farmland and wine country.http://geo-mexico.com/?p=12768 * Canada Geotourism in Canada includes Nova Scotia. It was visited by explorers and geologists from around the world for centuries, Nova Scotia‚Ä≤s geological sites are now recognized for their beauty as much as for their rich history. Nova Scotia‚Äôs sites include the iconic lighthouses, which is built on rocky precipices that reach out into the sea. * Portugal Geotourism in Portugal includes the Geopark of Arouca, which, in 2010, was officially recognized and joined the Global network of Geoparks, under the auspices of UNESCO. The park is known for its natural, gastronomical, and cultural heritage. This mountainous area, with rivers, natural parks, steep slopes and lush vegetation covers the entire municipality of Arouca. The granite used to build so many religious and historical monuments, Romanesque chapels and Baroque churches in the region came was extracted from its mountains ‚Äì Freita and Montemuro. As the practice of sustainability in all forms (environmental, social, and economy) becomes a more revered topic and gains traction within political spheres, sociologists suggest refining the practices of tourism to fit a mold that is more conducive to the sustainability models. Tazim et al. suggests the key to sustainable tourism lies within the responsible practice of travelers, but also within the direct participation of the locals in tourism practices. Although Geotourism shows to be a viable alternative for mass tourism, reducing the footprint of travellers on different parts of the world, there have been criticisms made regarding its fairness to the local population. Issues of fair pay, and the rights of the local people are the basis of the ethical dilemmas this kind of tourism faces. Tourism has a direct effect on the culture of the local populous, and as such, the focus of sociologists has been how to maintain the local environment (physically, socioculturally, and economically) while at the same time, introduce people to a new culture.

The purpose of the law is to reduce water pollution caused by these products. Manufacture of the microbead-containing products was prohibited in July 2017, and retail sales are prohibited as of July 2018.United States. Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015. . Approved 2015-12-28.  Background  Over the course of the past 50 years, plastics have increasingly become a large part of people's lives all around the world. Due to the durability, versatility, and low cost of plastics, consumers and industries utilize plastics for a variety of products. However, with increased production and consumption of plastics comes an increase in plastic waste that inevitably makes its way into the ocean. Scientists estimate that there is over 150 million tons of plastic residing in the World's oceans today. Plastics are made from petroleum and resist biodegredation, they absorb persistent organic pollutants, leach chemicals that are toxic to humans and other organisms, degrade ocean and terrestrial ecosystems, and may impact migratory patterns, trophic structures (food chains), and habitats around the world. Plastics are a direct threat to the well-being of marine life as they can lead to entanglement causing animals to drown, it can impair their ability to catch food, and ingested plastics can block digestive tracts and cause starvation and even death. The detrimental impacts that plastics have on individual animals affects not only their livelihood, but may also affect the balance of ocean ecosystem and the ecological services they provide for human benefit. With the numerous health and environmental concerns that plastics pose, bans against many single use plastic products have become more and more prevalent throughout local and state governments in the United States and even in other countries across the globe. The United Nations Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution (GESAMP) estimated that roughly 80% of ocean pollution comes from anthropogenic activity, with plastics making up 60-95% of it. Plastic particles are found throughout all of the oceans worldwide and they accumulate in gyres located in between Earth's continents. Plastics that persist in the environment come from a wide range of sources including plastic bags, beverage containers, plastic packaging, fishing lines and ropes, and microplastics. Microplastics are defined as plastic particles up to five millimeters in diameter and include fragments from larger, previously broken down plastic items, clothing fibers (acrylic and polyester), and small particles referred to as microbeads. Microbeads are purposefully manufactured for cosmetics, cleaning products, and personal care products in many countries. They are too small to be recycled like other plastics, allowing them to accumulate and persist in the environment in large quantities. Since they are typically designed to be \\"rinsed-off,\\" microbeads easily make their way through sewage treatment plants and into surface waters (rivers, lakes or coastal waters). Due to their small size and large distribution, the beads are nearly impossible to remove. A 2015 study indicated that one use of a facial scrub containing microbeads may allow anywhere from 4,594 to 94,500 microbeads to enter the environment. Despite their small size, microbeads are harmful to the environment since their properties allow them to readily absorb toxic chemicals and they are capable of bioaccumulating to the highest trophic level, which includes humans.  State and federal legislation  States such as California, New York, and Illinois recognized the damage that plastic microbeads were doing and began to enact statewide and local county bans on microbeads. Their leadership spoke to the United States Congress, as did the support from the many groups who brought to light the harmful effects of microbeads. This motivated bipartisan support to ban microbeads on a federal level. Along with increasing number of local, city, and state laws across the United States already banning products with microbeads were various business groups, scientists, environmental groups, the fishing industry, the culinary industry, the tourism industry, and even the cosmetics industry that supported the ban on microbeads and encouraged Congress to make the microbead ban a federal law in the United States. Several cosmetics companies were already voluntarily choosing to stop using microbeads in their products. On March 4, 2015, Representative Frank Pallone (D-New Jersey) introduced the microbead ban to the House. On May 21, 2015 a bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand (D-New York). The House passed the bill on December 7, 2015. On December 18, 2015, the Senate passed the bill with unanimous consent from both Democratic and Republican parties. President Barack Obama signed the bill on December 28, 2015.  Exceptions  The Act limits the ban solely to \\"rinse-off\\" cosmetic products that perform an exfoliating function, such as toothpaste or face wash. Other products are not included, for example, other personal care products, cleaning products, and make-up. States like California already had strict bans on microbeads and were designed to avoid loopholes that would allow for harmful substitutes, while other states, like Illinois, banned microbeads, but allowed for biodegradable plastic products. The United States was the first country to ban microbeads, although since then several others have followed suit, including Italy, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. The loopholes in the US Microbead-Free Waters Act have become apparent to many other countries, especially in the United Kingdom, which has encouraged them to enact strict bans that will avoid all loopholes.  Substitute products  There are many economically feasible substitutes for plastic microbeads that do not leach toxins and will not contaminate waterways. Some of these include beeswax, shells, nuts, seeds, and sand which are naturally occurring, biodegradable, and are already being used in numerous personal care products. Banning plastic microbeads and single use plastics in general is crucial for a healthy environment.

Founded as a co-educational facility in 1831 in the aftermath of the Greek War of Independence, it became a center offering infant schooling, primary schooling and industrial training for girls only in 1843, closing its teacher training and boys elementary schools. In 1869, as demands for women's education increased, the school began offering private teacher training, resuming its history as one of the first normal schools in Greece. The school continued to operate into the 20th century as a girls high school, elementary school and kindergarten until 1982, when the high school was closed. The present facility, which is the oldest continuously-operated school in Greece, is a private pre-school and primary school. History Hill School was founded by the American missionaries, John Henry and Frances Maria (n√©e Mulligan) Hill in 1831, as an educational facility in Plaka, near the Ancient Agora of Athens. At the time of its establishment, Greece had just gained independence from the Ottoman Empire and was attempting to establish a functioning state. Athens had not yet been designated as the capital and upon arrival in the city, the Hills found the city in ruins. They began offering a classical school with Biblical training in their home to local children and within two months enrollment had gone from 20 to 167 pupils. It was the only school in Greece offering education to women at that time. By 1834, the school had gained approval from the Greek authorities and King Otho of Greece suggested that it include training to teach girls to become teachers. The following year, the school building was constructed at the corner of N. Nikodimou Street and Toukididou Street (in the same location which it is now housed) and the nursery school, the first kindergarten in Greece, began operating. Within two years, a boarding school had been established and the school had earned a favorable reputation, as well as patronage by some of Athens' wealthiest families. Mrs. Hill was supervising co-educational \\"infant\\" schooling for four to eight-year-olds, a girls' primary school, an industrial training school to teach poverty-stricken girls sewing and domestic work, and a normal school. Under her management were three female teachers sent by the Episcopal Foreign Mission Board, as well as several Greek teachers. In 1842, after anti-missionary attacks on the school, the facility was closed for the duration of the term. When it reopened the following year, only kindergarten, the girls' elementary school, and the girls' industrial school were offered. The elementary school became a distinguished facility and its graduation ceremonies attracted local dignitaries. One of its students in the 1880s, was Sevasti Kallisperi, who would become the first Greek woman to graduate from a university and through the 1970s, the school remained one of the leading girl's educational facilities in Athens. In 1869, Mrs. Hill reopened the normal school as the Hill Institute and operated it as a private school, in addition to the other facilities. She continued administering the organization until her death in 1884. At that time, her niece, Bessie Masson, assumed direction of the school, managing it for the next 34 years. In 1918, upon Masson's death, the 3rd generation of the family, took over the direction of the school managing it until 1957, during which time the boarding facilities closed. In 1953, the school received a citation from the City of Athens upon achieving its 122nd year of operation. The kindergarten, elementary and high school continued through the fourth generation of the hill family, until the girls' high school was closed in 1982. The sixth generation of the Hill family currently operate the kindergarten and grammar school, which is the oldest school in continuous operation in the country and continues to be one of the leading schools in Athens.

The film was released theatrically on March 17, 2017, and was released on VOD on March 21, 2017. Plot In the near future, the clash between oil and green energy conglomerates results in skyrocketing energy prices and global riots. Amidst this chaos, the corporation Auxilisun develops the tri-fission reactor, a device that not only produces abundant nuclear energy through atomic fission, but also converts nuclear waste into additional clean energy. The tri-fission reactor renders all other forms of energy production obsolete, and Auxilisun power plants are built around the world, providing an inexhaustible supply of cheap energy for all. Decades later, on Christmas Day, Auxilisun technician Abby travels to Gibson Desert North, the flagship Auxilisun plant built over a nuclear waste storage facility deep within a radioactive \\"red zone\\", to restore a broken communications relay. She finds the plant poorly-maintained and seemingly deserted, with no sign of caretakers Dr. Zek and Robinson, but the latter appears brandishing a golf club and demands that she identify herself. He calms down when she complies, but when asked about Zek, he vaguely replies that the doctor is somewhere outside the plant conducting a survey. As Abby attempts to repair the communications relay and Zek remains absent, she gradually discovers more serious problems affecting the plant's performance and becomes suspicious of the oddly-behaving Robinson, who displays a considerable ignorance of the workings of the machines he supposedly maintains. Abby eventually tracks Zek down in the red zone, but finds him unconscious. When she returns to the plant with Zek in tow, Robinson initially refuses them entry, but soon relents and explains he was following contamination protocol. Robinson also reveals that Zek had experienced a nervous breakdown on the night he left. With Zek moved to the medical bay to recover, a new crisis emerges: one of the plants two main ventilation fans, ostensibly designed to function flawlessly for thousands of years, inexplicably fails, and volatile gases begin building up in the facility. Abby concludes that the fan had been sabotaged by a crazed Zek before her arrival, and handcuffs him to his bed. Zek finally awakes, and despite treating Robinson with familiarity, he informs Abby that Robinson is an impostor. Days ago, the real Robinson had disappeared and Zek had gone out in search of him, but was knocked out by an unseen assailant, likely the impostor. Somehow, the false Robinson had made it past the red zone and was posing as Robinson for unknown reasons. Zek urges Abby to send a distress signal to Auxilisun HQ, but with comms still down, she has to venture back outside the plant and build a makeshift array while Robinson is occupied. That night, as Abby tries to slip out of the plant with Zek to send the signal, Robinson catches them and angrily demands Zek tell Abby the truth about Gibson Desert North. Zek fends Robinson off and locks him and Abby in the medical bay. Robinson explains to Abby that Zek had rigged the entire plant into a bomb. As they search the plant separately for Zek, Abby discovers the real Robinson's body in a locker and realizes Zek had not lied. After Robinson incapacitates Zek, Abby turns against Robinson, but the latter overpowers her and amputates one of her fingers to unlock Deep Burial, the facility's nuclear waste repository. Abby confronts Zek with her findings that Gibson Desert North had been decaying for years despite Auxilisun's public assurances that the technology was failsafe, and that the red zone had expanded hundreds of miles into a town called Barrow Creek and was killing the residents. Zek confirms that Barrow Creek was being covered up to avoid a public relations disaster, as too much of the world was dependent on Auxilisun to allow its technology to be called into question. Disgusted, Abby leaves him to escape the plant on his own. At Deep Burial, Abby corners Robinson, who unmasks himself as the sole survivor of Barrow Creek. Since he had already been fatally irradiated, he had walked through the red zone to Gibson Desert North to destroy it and avenge the death of his family. Robinson then ignites Deep Burial, setting off a catastrophic chain reaction. Abby makes it out of the imploding facility, but when the only transport craft leaves her stranded, she removes her protective suit's helmet and allows herself to succumb to the radiation. Sometime later, presumed Auxilisun employees secure evidence of the disaster, including Abby's corpse and the datapad containing her personal logs.

The original goal of the bill was to give the U.S. government more legal control over U.S. lakes, rivers, and waterways entering the U.S. by creating quality control standards and regulations to help maintain these standards. In addition to pollution control, the act identified U.S. waterways as a vital resource and requires a permit for any obstruction to navigable water. The Rivers and Harbors Act also identified commonly used U.S. waterways, allowing congress to distribute funds for improvements. The amount designated to each of the identified waterway was based on how economically stimulating the waterway was. Inland Navigable U.S. Waterways The Rivers and Harbors Act is regulated under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining the standards set by the Rivers and Harbors Act, while the U.S. Coast Guard is primarily responsible for the permits needed to build in U.S. navigable waters. As a result of the bill being passed in 1899, the Rivers and Harbors Act became the first environmental law in the U.S. that directly regulated pollution of waterways and served as a precursor to the revision of the Clean Water Act.  Renewal of Permits Under the Obama Administration  On January 6, 2017, the Army U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reissued 50 existing nationwide permits (NWPs) and 2 new NWPs. NWPs are permits required under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1988 for construction of projects interacting or crossing U.S. waterways. Under the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act, NWPs require that the project has a minimal individual and cumulative impact on the current environment during the timeframe of the issued NWP. Meaning developers must take care that any disruption to the surrounding environment is necessary for the project to be completed. The permits issued under the NWPs are set to expire on March 18, 2022, 5 years from their official issue date (March 19, 2017). Part of the 50 reissued permits also include construction of natural gas, oil, and other fossil fuel pipelines. This includes the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has caused major controversies over its possible affects on the surrounding environment. Because of this controversy, the Obama Administration did not grant a real estate easement to the developers. This action by the Obama Administration did not stop the construction because the jurisdiction still falls under the Rivers and Harbors Act, which is overseen by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The New York City AIDS Memorial is located on the triangular traffic island formed by 12th Street, Greenwich Avenue and Seventh Avenue in Greenwich Village. The memorial is a gateway to a new public park adjacent to the former St. Vincent's Hospital, which housed the city's first and largest AIDS ward and which is often considered the symbolic epicenter of the disease, figuring prominently in The Normal Heart, Angels in America, and other important pieces of literature and art that tell the story of the plague years in New York. The memorial consists of an high steel canopy covering about . The structure is composed by triangles ranging from scalene to equilateral. Three triangles serve as legs to connect two large triangles at the top, so that it looks like an open airplane. Each of the triangles is filled with 16 smaller triangles and all have lines like air vents that light up in the night.

The conference was founded in 2003 by cocktail enthusiast Ann Tuennerman, and as of 2016 hosts between 15,000 and 17,000 ticketed attendants. History Tales of the Cocktail began in 2002 as the New Orleans Original Cocktail Tour, a walking tour of historic New Orleans bars hosted by local cocktail aficionado Ann Tuennerman (n√©e Rogers). In September 2003, Tuennerman celebrated the first anniversary of the tour by hosting Tales of the Cocktail, a small gathering of cocktail enthusiasts and industry professionals that included legendary bartender and writer Dale DeGroff. After a hiatus following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Tales of the Cocktail returned to New Orleans in 2006 and resumed operation. The event was moved up to July to avoid overlapping with the anniversary of the hurricane, and has taken place in the summer ever since. Ann Tuennerman retired from Tales of the Cocktail on September 25, 2017. Mrs. Tuennerman informed the diversity council that her husband Paul Tuennerman would be returning to work at Tales. Several members of the council resigned in protest at not being included in the decision. Mrs. Tuennerman resigned soon there after. In February, 2018 the Solomon Family and Neal Bodenheimer purchased the trademarks for Tales of the Cocktail, Ann and Paul Tuennerman completely divested from the trademarks and all business associated with Tales of the Cocktail. Additionally, there was a complete overhaul of the Board of Directors for the non-profit called New Orleans Culinary and Cultural Preservation Society. The Tales of the Cocktail Foundation was officially formalized under new leadership, with a mission to educate, advance, and support our industry, on February 15, 2018. Location Tales of the Cocktail is primarily hosted at the Hotel Monteleone in New Orleans‚Äô French Quarter, but many events take place at other nearby bars, hotels, and event venues. In November 2018, Tales of the Cocktail announced a new brick and mortar location in downtown New Orleans. The venue will serve as both an event space and full service cocktail bar. Spirited Awards In 2007, Tales of the Cocktail launched the Spirited Awards, an annual awards ceremony honoring bars, bartenders, and other industry professionals from around the world. Some of the top awards include American and International categories of Best Cocktail Bar, Bartender of the Year, Best Cocktail & Spirits Publication, World‚Äôs Best Cocktail Menu, and numerous others.

Hill (July 10, 1799‚ÄîAugust 5, 1884) was an American missionary and educator who moved to Greece during the Greek War of Independence and established the first educational facilities for girls in Greece. She and her husband were the first foreign missionaries sent by the Episcopal Church in the United States to serve abroad. While her husband worked to establish their mission, Hill supervised the girls' educational facilities and ran the mission during his absences. After her retirement from the mission, she founded a teacher training academy and continued to administer the school until her death. Early life Frances Maria Mulligan was born on July 10, 1799 in New York City, New York to Elizabeth (n√©e Winter) and John W. Mulligan. She was the eldest of nine children, three boys and six girls, in the family. Her father was a prominent attorney in New York City and her grandfather Hercules Mulligan was an Irish immigrant who had served in the Revolutionary War. He was a familiar of both George Washington and Alexander Hamilton. Educated at home with her siblings in the family mansion on Cedar Street across the street from the Old Dutch Church, Mulligan was trained as was typical for cultured and refined young women in the period. On April 26, 1821, she married John Henry Hill, a local banker. Hill was a Sunday school teacher at St. George's Episcopal Church (Manhattan) and her husband was the superintendent of the Sunday school. In 1829, John retired from banking to enter the Virginia Theological Seminary. When he was ordained in 1830, the couple were posted to Greece, the first foreign mission undertaken by the Episcopal Church. Career On October 1, 1830, the couple set sail along with Mr. Bingham, a printer and the Rev. John Jacob Robertson and his wife Julia. They arrived in Malta on November 16. Robertson had been the minister who had originally proposed a foreign mission to the church. From Malta, they proceeded that same day to Smyrna making their way to Tenos, where they would remain until spring due to the ongoing conflict in Athens during the Greek struggle against the Ottoman Empire. On May 26, 1831 the group left the island and made their way to Athens, their original destination. By July 18, they had found suitable accommodations for Hill to establish a school for girls, as Athens was in ruins due to the war. She began with twenty pupils, who studied in the basement of the house she and her husband occupied in Plaka, near the Ancient Agora of Athens. Within two months enrollment at the school had increased to 167 pupils, ranging in age from three to eighteen years old. It was the only school in Greece offering education to women at that time and from the beginning, the girls' schools were under the direction of Hill, while her husband supervised the boys' education. While the two husbands returned to Smyrna on missionary business, in September, Hill and Mrs. Robertson remained in Athens and taught at the school. Robertson was in charge of teaching needle skills to the girls, while Hill attended to their recitation and reading skills, using the Bible as their main text book. The girls also studied geography, spelling, writing and mathematics. The girls were divided into three groups, the elementary school, a trade school to teach those students who would need to earn a living industrial skills and a teacher training school. Within eighteen months, Mrs. Robertson withdrew from active participation because of her growing family, leaving Hill, as the only teacher for girls at the facility. Hill's goal was to use local girls to serve as under-teachers to assist with instruction; however, as there were only two schools teaching girls in Greece, the other being on the island of Syros, she found she had to train the teachers before she could employ them. By 1834, Hill had received the approval of the Greek government for the normal school, the only such facility in operation. Three assistant teachers, Elizabeth and Frederica Mulligan and Mary B. Baldwin had been sent by the Missionary Board and were assisting with teaching the school in 1836. In 1837, Hill founded a boarding school for paying students of wealthy Greek families. The students were housed in a wing of the mission house and had 70 enrollees. Continuing her supervision of all the female students, Hill also oversaw the boys' education during 1841, when her husband took an extended trip to the United States. During that time, she also maintained all the mission duties. In 1842, an attack against the mission and Rev. Hill was launched by an editor of The Age, a newspaper in Athens. Investigation by an ecclesiastical commission appointed by the Synod of the Kingdom, cleared the Hills of any anti-Greek actions, as were alleged by the paper. The editor then attacked the Synod, as well as the Archbishop of Argos, for support of the missionaries and its editor was prosecuted by the government. The strain of managing the mission and the subsequent allegations of wrongdoing caused Hill to suspend the school for girls for the remainder of the year, retiring to the countryside to regain her health. She was sent an official communique from the Secretary of State, of the government's satisfaction with her efforts to educate Greek girls and returned to the school in November with a class of 500 students. These students were the pupils of the kindergarten, elementary school for girls and the industrial training classes for girls. The boarding school, normal school, and boys' schools were not reopened. In late 1843, the Mission Board determined that they would suspend the mission in Athens, but an onslaught of support from organizations and individuals reversed their decision, allowing the girls' school to continue. Hill continued to manage the school until her husband retired from mission work in 1869. Rather than stop teaching, she then organized the Hill Institute, a private normal school. She continued to assist Marian Muir, who had taken over operation of the mission schools. Death and legacy Hill died on August 5, 1884 in Athens, two years after her husband's death. They were both buried in the Protestant Cemetery of Athens and marble monument to them was erected at the grave site by the City of Athens. Her niece, Bessie Masson, took over the administration of the Hill Memorial School which was still in operation in 2015 as the oldest continuously-operating school founded by missionaries in the country.

She served as County Superintendent of Instruction for Madera County, California from 1899 until 1911. Early years and education Her father, J. D. Bagnelle, was born in Mississippi, of an old southern family descended from French progenitors and identified with the early history of Virginia. During his early manhood, he moved to Illinois and engaged in the mercantile business at Litchfield, until his early death. He married Amanda Slaughter (born December 28, 1901, Tennessee). The Slaughter family is traced back to 1608 in Scotland, and three brothers coming from that country founded the family in America. Estella Bagnelle's education, begun in Litchfield, her native town, was completed in the state normal school of San Jose, California (now San Jose State University), from which she was graduated in 1885. Career After teaching for a year in San Jose, in 1887 she began to teach in the district schools of Madera county, and afterward was for eight years connected with the Madera schools. During the first six years of this time, she held the position of vice-principal and then for two years served as principal.

At the expiration of that time, in 1902, she was re- elected without opposition. There are four improvements for which she has labored indefatigably, namely: uniformity of text books; higher standard of teachers; better salaries; and more interest among trustees. Aside from her duties as superintendent, she served as secretary of the San Joaquin Teachers' Association, was interested in the National Educational Association, and had sympathy with all movements for the benefit of the profession. May, 1893, she was chosen a member of the county board of education, at the time of the organization of Madera county, and after 1899, she officiated as secretary of the board. Personal life After retiring in January, 1911, she married the miner, Oscar H. McDonald, of Coarsegold, California on April 5, in Oakland, and they removed to Nome, Alaska on May 1.

It is also known as the Casa Branca do Engenho Velho, Terreiro Casa Branca, or simply the Casa Branca. It is located on Vasco da Gama Avenue in the Engenho Velho neighborhood of Salvador. The terreiro is associated with the Ketu branch of the religion and is publicly represented by the Sociedade S√£o Jorge do Engenho Velho. Il√™ Ax√© Iy√° Nass√¥ Ok√° was incorporated by the mid-19th century but traces its lineage an earlier period. Il√™ Ax√© Iy√° Nass√¥ Ok√° is considered to be the oldest Candombl√© terreiro in Brazil, and was the first non-Roman Catholic and first Afro-Brazilian religious place of worship to receive heritage status from the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN). The terreiro covers and includes religious structures, sacred objects, trees associated with Candombl√© rituals, and open space. History Il√™ Ax√© Iy√° Nass√¥ Ok√° traces its origins to Terreiro de la Barroquinha, which was founded in the 19th century by three freed slaves of African birth: Iy√° Nass√¥, Iy√° Kal√° and Iy√° Det√°. Iy√° Nass√¥ rented land at the abandoned Velho do Rio Vermelho de Baixo sugar mill, on what is now Vasco da Gama Avenue, and created a new terreiro at the location. Members of the group traveled to Africa in the early 19th century to \\"study and assure the authenticity of the ritual and doctrine\\" of their faith. The terreiro was formally founded in the 1830s; the Jornal da Bahia of May 3, 1855 contains the earliest published reference to the terreiro Engenho Velho. Succession disputes at the terreiro led to the establishment of two new terriros: Il√™ Iy√° Omi Ax√© Iamass√© in the Gantois neighborhood, and Il√™ Ax√© Op√¥ Afonj√° in the S√£o Gon√ßalo neighborhood. Both remain active and are also central centers of Candombl√© in Brazil. The terreiro was registered as a public entity under the name Sociedade Beneficente e Recreativa S√£o Jorge do Engenho Velho in on July 25, 1943. The existence of the Il√™ Ax√© Iy√° Nass√¥ Ok√° was threatened in the early 1980s due to real estate speculation. The terreiro did not own the land on which it sat and the land owner put the property up for sale; the terreiro was threatened with expulsion from the area. A social movement to preserve the terreiro began in this period with the support of the Afro-Brazilian political groups, local politicians, and population of Salvador. Public personalities such as M√£e Menininha do Gantois, Jorge Amado, the artist Caryb√©, Dorival Caymmi, and Oscar Niemeyer advocated for preservation of the terreiro. The city of Salvador gave historic preservation status to the terreiro in 1982, studies by the federal government followed in 1983 and federal landmark status in 1985. Candombl√© was and remains a syncretic faith; members recognize and participate in Catholic masses and festivals. A movement at the end of the 20th century sought to remove Catholic elements from some terreiros, including at Il√™ Ax√© Iy√° Nass√¥ Ok√°. Catholic statues and other iconography have gradually been removed from the terriro. Lineage Il√™ Ax√© Iy√° Nass√¥ Ok√° has a well-recorded list of iyalorishas, or female heads of the terreiro. * Iy√° Nass√¥ * Iy√° Marcelina da Silva, Ob√° Tossi * Iy√° Maria J√∫lia Figueiredo, Omoniqu√™ * Iy√° Ursulina Maria de Figueiredo, Tia Sussu * Iy√° Maximiana Maria da Concei√ß√£o, Oin Funqu√™, known as Tia Massi * Iy√° Maria Deolinda Gomes dos Santos, Ok√™ * Iy√° Marieta Vit√≥ria Cardoso, Oxum Niqu√™ * Altamira Cec√≠lia dos Santos, Oxum Tominw√° Grounds and structures The grounds of Il√™ Ax√© Iy√° Nass√¥ Ok√° are dedicated to the orixa Oxossi, but its main temple is dedicated to Xango. The grounds also include a number of smaller buildings. Some contain shrines, others are houses belonging to members of the community. There are also statues and a large area with vegetation, including trees holding shrines. Oxum Square Il√™ Ax√© Iy√° Nass√¥ Ok√° opens to Oxum Square at its entrance. Its distinctive feature is a Barco de Oxum, or boat dedicated to the orisha Oxum. The square was renovated according to a plan by the architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012), and is one of his two projects in Salvador.\\"As 14 obras de Niemeyer no Nordeste: duas das obras de Niemeyer no Nordeste est√£o em Pernambuco.\\" Diario de Pernambuco 26 Mar. 2015.

The Casa Branca is an elongated building divided into one large hall for public ceremonies and numerous smaller rooms. A kitchen is used for the preparation of ritual foods, and private rooms for religious leaders of the terreiro. A white flag tops the structure and indicates its sacred nature. The roof of the Casa Branca barrac√£o has symbols of Xango, which identify him as the patron of the temple.

The experiment studies magnetic plasma confinement to support controlled nuclear fusion experiments. Specifically, the PV Rotamak can be used as either a spherical tokamak or a field-reversed configuration. Some time between 2015 and 2017, all personnel left the project, leaving it vacant.  Background  FRCs and spherical tokamaks are of interest to the plasma physics community because of their confinement properties and their small size. While most large fusion experiments in the world are tokamaks, FRCs and STs are seen as a viable alternative because of their higher Beta, meaning the same power output could be produced from a smaller volume of plasma, and their good plasma stability.  History  The PV Rotamak was built in 2001, largely out of components of the disassembled Flinders Rotamak. The PV Rotamak has furnished the experimental data to produce more than 12 academic papers on plasma physics as of 2017.  Apparatus  The experimental apparatus consists of a vacuum vessel, electromagnetic coils, a high-power radio-frequency (RF) generation system to run the rotating magnetic field (RMF), and diagnostics. The vacuum vessel is made of Pyrex glass and is 80 cm long and 40 cm in diameter. The electromagnetic coils can produce up to 230 Gauss (0.023 Tesla) magnetic fields center of the vacuum vessel. Another electromagnetic coil running through the axis of the vacuum vessel can produce the magnetic field necessary to make the apparatus a spherical tokamak. The RF generation system can deliver 400 kW of power to the plasma in the form of a rotating magnetic field at a frequency of 500 kHz. The RMF can run for 40ms at a time.  Plasma Parameters  The electron density during a typical discharge of the PV Rotamak is 1\\\\cdot10^{12}/cm^3 . This is about 1000x lower than a burning thermonuclear plasma would have to achieve. The electron temperature during a typical discharge is 10-30eV, again about 1000x lower than a burning thermonuclear plasma. The power into the plasma is 400 kW, compared to 10s of MW in large Tokamaks.  Contributions  Early experiments in the PV Rotamak sought to characterize the difference between FRC and Spherical tokamak configurations. They found that the inclusion of a toroidal magnetic field (turning the FRC into an ST) led to increased particle confinement and performance. Later experiments sought to characterize and mitigate the n=1 tilt mode of the FRC. This is an instability of FRCs that can cause loss of the plasma. They measured the stability boundaries of this mode, and found that an additional electromagnetic coil around the middle of the machine pinched the FRC into two separate pieces, mitigating the tilt mode. Recent (2015) experiments on the PV Rotamak dealt with heating the plasma with microwaves. 6 kW of power was injected into the plasma. Researchers found that they were able to drive current with the microwaves relatively efficiently, but this small amount of power was not sufficient to appreciably change the density or temperature of the plasma.

It is one of the largest urban nature parks in the world. It protects an area of Atlantic Forest in the west of the city of Rio de Janeiro that includes the highest point in the city, the Pico da Pedra Branca. Location The Pedra Branca State Park is in the west of the city of Rio de Janeiro, and has an area of . It is one of the largest urban nature parks in the world. The park contains the Pico da Pedra Branca, the highest point of the city at . It is surrounded by the neighborhoods of Guaratiba, Bangu, Realengo, Jacarepagu√°, Barra da Tijuca, Recreio dos Bandeirantes, Grumari and Campo Grande. The park contains the chapel of S√£o Gon√ßalo do Amarante, built in 1625, and the church of Nossa Senhora de Monserrat, built in 1776. The park provides water to the Pau da Fome, Camorim, Taxas and Engenho Novo dams. The aqueduct that cuts through the park takes water from the Guandu River to Rio's south zone. The park occupies about 10% of the city, and protects more than half of the city's Atlantic Forest. History European occupation of the Pedra Branca range began late in the 16th century, when Salvador Correia de S√° donated lands in the area to his sons in 1594. At the end of the 17th century some of the land was donated to Benedictine monks, who developed farms and cattle fields. By the end of the 19th century there were extensive coffee plantations, and a movement developed against the resulting deforestation that resulted in some efforts at reforestation. In the early 20th century the old coffee plantations were divided into smaller banana plantations. The Camorim Water Treatment Unit and Pau da Fome Dam were built in 1908. The Camorim dam supplies water for 20,000 people. An aqueduct was built in the 1960s at what is now the Piraquara Center. The massive growth of the city caused human occupation to spread uphill into the regenerating forests in the mid 20th century. The area of the Pedra Branca State Park was declared of public utility for the purpose of expropriation by decree-law 1634 of April 1963. After a long period of studies, the park was formally created by state law No. 2377 of 28 June 1974. The area above was included in the park. It is managed by the State Forest Institute Foundation (IEF). In 2003 the state government launched a R$4 million program to revitalize the park. This included a permanent exhibition \\"Da Pedra Branca ao Pau da Fome\\" for students that describes the geology, flora and fauna. The park is part of the Carioca Mosaic and has been recognized by UNESCO as an Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve. Environment Small swamp at Grumari The city of Rio de Janeiro has a humid tropical climate, with maximum rainfall in December - March and least rainfall in June - August. Annual rainfall averages , with most rain in the summer. Usually the winds blow from the mainland towards the sea in the morning, and from the southeast in the afternoon and evening. The Pedra Branca Massif affects the flow of air and moisture throughout the city. The north slopes are warmer and drier, while the slopes facing west, south and east are more temperate and humid. The park contains typical Atlantic Forest vegetation. Vegetation is in different stages of regeneration. The dominant type is dense rainforest. 934 species of flora in 118 botanical families have been cataloged, of which 429 have some level of endemism. The endemic bromeliad Neoregelia camorimiana is found in forests in an advanced stage of regeneration. These are mostly in the Camorim region and include species such as Brazilwood (Caesalpinia echinata), copa√≠ba (Copaifera lucens), Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra), and red fig tree (Ficus americana). 338 species of birds have been identified, of which 20 are threatened to some extent, such as the white-eared parakeet (Pyrrhura leucotis). There are 51 species of mammals of which 8 are threatened. The fruit bat morcego-fruteiro-claro is vulnerable to extinction in Brazil. Threatened species include collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), channel-billed toucan (Ramphastos vitellinus), rusty-margined guan (Penelope superciliaris), brown-backed parrotlet (Touit melanonotus), boa constrictor (Boa constrictor) and striped worm lizard (Ophiodes striatus). There are 43 species of fish of which 5 are endangered. The park is surrounded by large urban areas, and is under intense human pressure. As of 2013 there were 40 park rangers and the state's first environmental police unit. Fires are common in the driest part of year, from June to July, often caused by candle-powered paper hot air balloons released in festivals, but are quickly suppressed. Visiting Dam at Pau da Fome As of 2013 there were an average of 3,000 visitors per month, or 36,000 annually, but the park management aimed to attract up to 60,000 visitors per year by 2016. The park is open daily from 8am to 5pm. Centers PEPB has three administrative centers: Pau da Fome, Camorin and Piraquara. The park headquarters is in the Pau da Fome Center in Taquara, Jacarepagu√°. It has an exhibition center in the building designed by the architect Zanine Caldas for Eco 92. The Camorin Center, also in Jacarepagu√°, has a water collection and treatment system and a trail leading to the Camorim Dam. The Piraquara Center in Realengo has a nursery for seedlings. The center has a visitor building, toilets, leisure areas and environmental guides. The Cachoeira do Barata (Barata Waterfall) in the Piraquara center is one of the biggest attractions. The waterfall is in fact a series of falls and stretches of the Piraquara River that can be used for relaxation, with an artificial swimming pool at the foot. Beside it there is a children's playground, exercise equipment, tables and picnic areas. Trails Grumari Beach There are several ecological trails and walks. Guided tours are available, including an walk to the top of the Pedra Branca. The bi-lingual Portuguese/English trail guide with maps and photographs was published by INEA in 2013. The trails have different lengths and levels of difficulty to cater to all tastes. *The Circuito das √Åguas Trail passes waterfalls weirs and dams. *The Rio Grande Trail with descriptive signs is at the Pau da Fome center, designed for all ages. Attractions include the 19th century aqueduct, the Figuera Dam, a corner of the Padaria Dam, and typical bromeliads and tree of the Atlantic Forest. *The A√ßude Camorim Trail, starting at the Camorim Center, provides a beautiful view of the Camorim reservoir, which is about one quarter of the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon. *The Piabas- Grumari Crossing leads to Grumari Beach, where visitors may bathe, and includes gazebos and dense Atlantic Forest vegetation. *The Santa B√°rbara Trail is one of the most popular, and leads from the Pau a Fome to the Pico da Pedra Branca, with steep stretches. The Pico da Pedra Branca trail, leading to the highest point, is long but easy. *The shorter Pedra do Quilombo trail is harder, and includes a exposed section on a rock face where a steel cable and metal foot rests have been installed. *The Caverna Carlos Bandeira Trail leads to and through the Carlos Bandeira cave. *The crossing from Rio da Prata to Pau da Fome, via Monte Alegre, crosses the Pedra Branca massif. It is the hardest trail, with a maximum altitude of . It has natural lookouts, rivers, waterfalls and Atlantic Forest vegetation. *The crossing from Jacarepagu√° to Campo Grande follows sections of an old colonial road, and remnants of the stone pavement are still visible.

This meant that the 5.8 Œºm and 8.0 Œºm detectors could not function as they required the cryogenic cooling, but the 3.6 Œºm and 4.5 Œºm detectors remained about as sensitive as they were during the primary mission. The other two Spitzer instruments (IRS and MIPS) likewise ceased to function as they worked at longer wavelengths, leaving IRAC as the sole operational instrument. The cryogenic assembly of IRAC is contained in the Multiple Instrument Chamber (MIC), which also houses the other focal plane elements and the pointing calibration reference sensor. In the MIC is the Infrared Array Camera, Infrared Spectrograph, and Multiband Imaging Photometer, as well as the pointing calibration reference sensor. The MIC is attached to the cryostat and it is intended to keep the science instruments cold, including IRAC, but also functions to keep out stray light. The MIC is mounted to the helium chamber inside the cryostat vacuum shell, not only to efficiently keep the instruments cold but to seal out any stray light. Its warm electronics assembly is housed in the spacecraft bus. The IRAC instrument was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and the detectors were built by Raytheon. Its operational and scientific management is handled by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Bands summary IRAC is capable of observing in the wavelengths of 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 microns. When its coolant ran out, only the two shorter wavelengths remained usable.

Andrusenko joined the Red Army in 1918, fighting in the Russian Civil War in Ukraine and the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. During the interwar period, he became an infantry officer and studied at the Frunze Military Academy just before the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Andrusenko commanded two different rifle regiments in the Battle of Moscow before taking command of the 329th Rifle Division in December. In March 1942, his division was encircled and destroyed. Andrusenko escaped and was sentenced to death for \\"inaction\\", but the sentenced was changed to ten years and delayed until the end of the war. He was demoted to command a cadet rifle brigade, which he led during the Battle of Stalingrad. For an unauthorized retreat, he was again demoted to command of a regiment. For his subsequent leadership of the regiment, Andrusenko was restored in rank and for his actions in the Battle of the Dnieper was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. In January 1944, he was given command of the 55th Rifle Division, leading it in Operation Bagration and the Baltic Offensive. In the spring of 1945 Andrusenko took command of the 184th Rifle Division in the Soviet Far East and led it in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August of that year. He retired from the army after the end of the war.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Andrusenko was born on 27 September 1899 to a peasant family with seven children in Parafiyevka, Chernigov Governorate (now in Ichnia Raion). From the age of eight he worked as a farmhand for his landlord. Andrusenko graduated from the local three-grade rural school. From 1909, he worked as a laborer at the Parafiyevka sugar factory. Andrusenko worked as a fitter and turner at the Linovizky sugar beet factory and the Slavyansk soda plant between 1913 and 1916. From 1916, he worked at the Sumy Machine Building Factory. In the summer of 1917, Andrusenko was fired from his job for distributing Bolshevik pamphlets. From June 1918, Andrusenko fought with the 1st Soviet Partisan Group in the Russian Civil War. In August, he volunteered for the Red Army, serving as a soldier in the 4th Nizhyn Regiment. He transferred to the 1st Kiev Communist Regiment in March 1919. From the beginning of 1920 Andrusenko served with the guard battalion at the Borzensky Uyezd Recruiting Office. During the Civil War, Andrusenko was involved in fighting against German and Austrian troops, the Ukrainian People's Army, the White Army, and the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army, among others. From August, he served with the 73rd and then 6th Rifle Regiments of the Southwestern Front, fighting in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War.  Interwar Period  From June 1921, Andrusenko studied at the Chernigov Infantry Courses. During his time at the courses, he was involved, along with other students, in the suppression of partisan activity. In 1922, the courses were reorganized and Andrusenko continued his studies at the Kiev Military Infantry School, from which he graduated in 1924. Around this time, he married Vera Ignatyevna. In September he became a platoon commander in the regimental school of the 45th Rifle Division's 134th Rifle Regiment and simultaneously a platoon commander in the regiment itself. In January 1925, Andrusenko transferred to command a platoon in the 6th Communications Regiment. He became a rifle platoon commander of the 137th Rifle Regiment in November, while doubling as a regimental school platoon commander. In 1925, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Andrusenko's son Volodya was born in 1926. In October 1929, Andrusenko became an instructor of the Training Corps of the Territorial Administration of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. He transferred to instructor duties at the Simferopol Raion Military commissariat in January 1931. In November of the same year, Andrusenko became military commissar of Borodianka Raion. From December 1932, he served as chief of the military office of the Odessa Red Army House. Andrusenko became assistant chief of staff of the 134th Rifle Regiment in April 1937. In September 1938, he became assistant chief of the 5th Department of the staff of the Central Asian Military District. Andrusenko became commander of the 8th Separate Battalion of Local Troops in April 1940. In April 1941, he became deputy commander of the 837th Rifle Regiment. In the same year, he graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in absentia.  World War II  The German invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941. In late July, Andrusenko, now a Colonel, was appointed commander of the 312th Rifle Division's 1081st Rifle Regiment, forming at Aktubinsk in the Central Asian Military District. After completing its formation, the division became part of the 52nd Army and fought near the Volkhov from late August. In late October, the division was relocated to the Western Front after German troops broke through towards Moscow in Operation Typhoon. On 17 October, Andrusenko transferred to the 93rd Rifle Division to command its 266th Rifle Regiment. He was wounded during fighting for Maloyaroslavets in November. After recovering, Andrusenko took command of the 329th Rifle Division in December. The division successively became part of the 5th Army and the 33rd Army. The 329th fought in the Rzhev-Vyazma Offensive from January 1942 as part of the 33rd Army. The division was encircled with the army, and escaped in small groups with heavy losses after Andrusenko was unable to organize a breakout in March. He was among those who escaped, and on 6 April was sentenced to death with deprivation of rank for \\"criminal inaction\\" by the Western Front's Military Tribunal. Andrusenko applied for a pardon, and on 4 May the Military Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court reduced the sentence to ten years in the labor camps, without deprivation of rights. The sentence was delayed until the end of the war, and he was demoted to major and appointed commander of the 115th Separate Cadet Rifle Brigade, part of the Western Front's 16th Army.

It is thought to have been one of the old registered distilleries in Ireland. Two of the distillery buildings, the grain store and maltings, still exist and now house the County Museum and Dundalk Library. The distillery was used as a navigation point by seamen due to its two large chimney stacks, one of which was the largest in Ireland when it was built in 1817.  History  Dundalk was home to a number of distilleries down through the years. The most notable of which was established in 1780 by James Gilleghan and Peter Godbey at Roden Place on the site of an old tannery and bleach ground. Subsequently, several Scotsmen joined the company. In 1802, the distillery is recorded as operating a 1,514 gallon still, which was quite large for the time. By 1804, the distillery is reported as being operated by James Reid, Malcolm Brown, James Gilleghan, Peter Godbey and William Hamilton. By 1807, the large still, the operation of which was impractical due to the licensing system, had been replaced by a smaller, 520 gallon still. In 1812, Brown married Gillichan's daughter, subsequently gaining control of the company and on the death of his partners, after which the operation became known as Malcolm Brown & Co. In 1817, Dundalk and its surrounds suffered from a scarcity of food due to a bad harvest. That year, the owners of the distillery, having large stores of grain, generously had the stock ground into meal and sold at a rate which the poor could afford. In the same year, a 162 ft tall, brick chimney stack was constructed at the distillery in that year (visible in the image above), which was the largest in Ireland at the time. Prior to the reform the excise regulations in 1823, distillation was based on the theoretical output of a pot still. The purpose of the large chimney was to allow firing of the pot still in the shortest possible time. In 1823, Malcolm Brown, then in the trade \\"nearly twenty years\\" gave testimony to a British House of Commons inquiry into distilling regulations in Ireland. In his testimony, given in June 1823, Brown stated that his operations had lost money for the preceding two years due to increased competition from illicit unlicensed distillers, which had increased eight- to ten-fold in number in the Dundalk region over the same period. As a result, Brown had ceased distilling at Dundalk the previous December, and that had no intention of resuming operations until the excise regulations were reformed. At the time, Brown stated that illicit spirits could be obtained for 4 - 5 shillings a gallon, and were the duty reduced to 2 shillings sixpence, licit spirit could be sold at around 5 - 6 shillings a gallon. With reduced duties, Brown stated that the price difference between licit and illicit spirits would narrow, prompting consumers to opt for licit spirits rather than risk a penalty by purchasing illicit spirit. Brown stated that whiskey from Dundalk distillery was principally consumed in nearby counties of Armagh, Cavan and Down, and that some of his matured spirit sold at 12 shillings a gallon. Records show that by 1837, the distillery was consuming 40,000 barrels of grain a year, with a staff of 100, and an output of 300,000 gallons of spirit a year (up from 285,000 gallons in 1826). The distillery prospered, and expanded further through the mid-1800s, with output more than doubling, in part due to the installation of a large Coffey still, becoming one of the most successful distilleries in the country. In 1854, Brown passed away without a son, and the distillery passed to his nephews, the Murrays. When Alfred Barnard, a British historian, visited the distillery in 1886, output had reached close to 700,000 gallons per annum. Barnard noted that much of the output from the distillery, was consumed locally, with the remainder exported to England and Scotland. At the time of Barnard's visit, the distillery was being run three brothers (John, Malcolm, and Henry Murray) whose granduncle had come to control the distillery around 1800. On 22 November 1862, a fire broke out in a corn kiln in the grain stores of the distillery, completely destroying the building which contained several thousand tonnes of grain. After a raising of the alarm, 500 men of the 15th, the King's Hussars (a cavalry regiment), along with fire engines and other constabulary rushed to the scene, preventing the fire from spreading further. At the time, the bonded storehouses contained 400,000 gallons of whiskey. It was estimated that the fire caused ¬£10,000 of damages and 100 redundancies. Unfortunately, one life was lost and several endangered after the incident, as during their efforts some of the hussars had consumed fusel oils, mistaking it for whiskey. By 1887, with a Coffey still employed alongside the existing pot stills, the distillery output had reached 700,000 proof gallons per annum. At this point, the distillery was well equipped with a cooperage and workshops for engineers, carpenters, smiths etc., and had a payroll of about 100 men. However, by the late 1800s, it appears that the distillery was experiencing financial difficulties, as an experienced external manager was recruited in 1898. For a period of time, the distillery found some success by focusing on the production of grain spirit, with yeast a lucrative by-product which was exported to England under the name of \\"Skylark\\". It is thought that at this stage production of pot still whiskey had ceased. This focus on yeast resulted in the production of an industrial spirit which the distillery was happy to off-load on the London market at a low price, a fact which disturbed the Distillers Company of Scotland (DCL), as their competing product was being undersold. However, as with many Irish distilleries, the distillery experienced further difficulties in the early 1900s, and in 1912, the distillery's owners decided to sell out and approached the United Distillers Company of Belfast, who offered to purchase the distillery in exchange for shares. However, wanting cash, the owners eventually accepted a competing of ¬£160,000 from DCL, who had interest in acquiring the distillery as it would end supply of industrial spirit outside the control of the DCL group. Under DCL ownership, production continued at Dundalk Distillery until 1926, when after 218 years, distilling stopped, the partition of Ireland in 1922 possibly hastening its demise. In 1927, the Irish Government entered negotiations with DCL with regard to re-opening the distillery in the interests of local employment. However, DCL stated that the distillery was uneconomic to work as the majority of product was exported to London, and that re-opening could only be reconsidered if they were offered an increased drawback on exports of spirits, and an import tariff on yeast. However, this proposal was rejected, and operations were wound up for good in 1929. In the years that followed, the main chimney was demolished, with the bricks used to construct nearby houses, while many of the distillery buildings were either demolished or left vacant. In the 1932, P.J. Carroll, the tobacco firm, purchased the grain store for use as a warehouse or bond store. In the 1960s, this was donated to Dundalk Urban Council for use as an exhibition centre. In 1994, this became home to the County Museum. Another distillery building now houses Dundalk Public Library.  Subsequent distilleries in Dundalk  John Teeling, founder of the Cooley Distillery, announced plans to redevelop the Great Northern Brewery in Dundalk as distilling complex in a ‚Ç¨35 million investment. The site was previously owned by Diageo and used mainly to brew Harp Lager. When complete the site will have a capacity to produce 3 million cases per annum, making it the second largest in Ireland. It will cater mainly for the third party market, a market Cooley catered for prior to its takeover by Beam Inc. (now Beam Suntory). In July 2015, distillation began at one of the two distilleries planned for the site following a ‚Ç¨10 million investment.
