Material by The Future features Martyn Ware, Ian Craig Marsh and Adi Newton, who recorded around ten songs in the home studio of a recording engineer in 1977. The band compiled a demo tape from those recordings, which they played to record companies on an ill-fated trip to London. The band did not find a recording deal and Newton left the band to form Clock DVA. Ware and Marsh continued as The Future for a short while before deciding to recruit Ware's friend Philip Oakey as lead vocalist. Now renamed The Human League, the trio recorded in an abandoned Sheffield factory, where they put together their first two singles for the Fast Product label (\\"Being Boiled\\" and \\"The Dignity Of Labour\\") as well as a number of other recordings before signing to Virgin Records. Most of those other recordings are included on this compilation album, along with many of The Future's recordings - only those songs that were later re-recorded for Virgin were omitted from the compilation, for contractual reasons. The album was compiled by Richard X and released on his Black Melody label in 2002, with assistance from Human League members past and present and Sean Turner, creator of the Blind Youth website. The album was preceded by the promotional limited edition EP Dance Like a Star, which included four Human League recordings not featured on the album.The Human League The album was re-issued in September 2005 as a re-mastered edition, both as a CD and as a digital download.

The lyrics were written in 1957 by Naomi W. Randall and set to music by Mildred Tanner Pettit. The song has been translated into over 90 languages. The phrase \\"I Am a Child of God\\" is also used in the LDS Church as a declaration of a basic teaching of the church. Composition Naomi W. Randall, lyricist Randall composed the first three verses of \\"I Am a Child of God\\" at the request of the general board of the Primary Association, of which she was a member. The board wanted a song that could teach children about LDS Church teachings on the nature of a child's relationship with God. Randall described how she composed the song: > I got down on my knees and prayed aloud, pleading that our Heavenly Father > would let me know the right words. Around 2:00 a.m., I awakened and began to > think again about the song. Words came to my mind. ‚Ä¶ I immediately got up > and began to write the words down as they had come to me. Three verses and a > chorus were soon formed. I gratefully surveyed the work, drank of the > message of the words, and returned to my bedroom where I knelt before my > Father in Heaven to say \\"Thank you!\\"Karen Lynn Davidson (1998). Our Latter- > day Hymns: The Stories and the Messages. The song is still sung in almost > every LDS church at least once per Sunday. (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret > Book) pp. 303‚Äì04. Randall mailed the lyrics to her friend Mildred T. Pettit in California, who wrote the accompanying music. Word change The song was first performed at a stake Primary conference in 1957. Several years later, apostle Spencer W. Kimball asked the Primary general board if the phrase \\"Teach me all that I must know / To live with him someday\\" could be changed to \\"Teach me all that I must do / To live with him someday\\". As Kimball later explained, \\"To know isn't enough. The devils know and tremble; the devils know everything. We have to do something.\\"\\"New Verse Is Written for Popular Song,\\" Church News, 1978-04-01, p. 16.See also Pat Graham, \\"Sharing Time: Fun with Favorites,\\" Friend, October 1984, p. 14. Randall accepted the change. Publication and additional verse The song was first published in the LDS Church's 1969 Sing with Me, a songbook for children. In 1978, Randall composed a fourth verse to the song. However, when the song was added to the LDS Church's 1985 hymnal, the decision was made to not include the fourth verse because it was considered by the Church Correlation Committee to be \\"not officially part of the song\\".Abbey Olsen, \\"Beloved Song Turns 50,\\" Ensign, February 2007, pp. 76‚Äì77. When a new church songbook for children was produced in 1989, the fourth verse was included. \\"I Am a Child of God\\" is hymn number 301 in the church's 1985 hymnal and on page 2 in the Children's Songbook. Use and popularity \\"I Am a Child of God\\" is one of the 45 hymns that the church publishes in its basic curriculum sources‚ÄúIndex of First Lines and Titles,‚Äù] Gospel Fundamentals (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2002) p. 276. that are used in areas of the world where the church is new or underdeveloped. Thus, it is often one of the first hymns that new Latter-day Saints receive and learn. The song has been translated into over 90 languages and has been the subject of numerous musical adaptations by choirs and other musicians. \\"I Am a Child of God\\" is a common phrase used in curriculum,See, e.g., \\"Lesson 1: I Am a Child of God,\\" Primary 1: I Am a Child of God (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2000) p. 1; \\"Lesson 3: I Am a Child of God,\\" Primary 2: Choose the Right A (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1995) p. 11; \\"Lesson Five: I Am a Child of God,\\" Family Home Evening Resource Book (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1997) p. 20. magazines,See, e.g., Vicki F.

She is a member of the AVN Hall of Fame and the XRCO Hall of Fame. Known life and known career Petty was raised in Chatsworth, California. Her first lead role was in Disco Lady, released in 1978, due to her physical resemblance to the at-the-time popular mainstream actress Farrah Fawcett. (She was, indeed, promoted as \\"the Farrah Fawcett look-alike,\\" which was also a marketing point of Little Orphan Dusty, released at the same approximate time.) Suitably, another of her stage names, \\"Sarah Dawcett,\\" traded off on that resemblance. However, Petty had obviously larger breasts than did the real Fawcett‚Äîa physical aspect the \\"look-alike\\" promotion glossed over. Petty was popular because she was unique in the industry for her time during the 1970s; she shaved her private parts and she often took part in then unconventional fisting scenes. She performed in numerous films with early porn icon John Holmes, in addition to performing often in lesbian scenes. Her career was at its height in the late 1970s and the early to middle 1980s. Petty starred in the film which debuted Holmes's future wife, Laurie Rose, who was then using the stage name Misty Dawn; this was The Greatest Little Cathouse in Las Vegas, released in 1982.

Biography Fantan Mojah was born in White Hill, St Elizabeth Parish, Jamaica. To gain experience, he took a job working with a traveling soundsystem, and performed songs during soundchecks. He adopted the name Mad Killer, in an homage to one of his favorite artists, Bounty Killer. After being exposed to the Rastafarian movement his music began to take on a more positive tone, and he was encouraged by Capleton to take the name Fantan Mojah. =Lyrical Themes= Fantan Mojah is notable for being one of the new wave of contemporary reggae singers who prefer to include positive themes in their lyrics. Like some popular new reggae singers, he is a Bobo Ashanti. His faith is reflected in his lyrics, where some recurring themes are - praise for Jah and messages of Rastafari, positive portrayal of women, and condemnation of ill morals. This is a contrast to many popular dancehall artists, who encourage \\"slackness\\" in their lyrics, with boasts of sexual prowess and derogatory messages to women. =Hail the King and success= After performing at many popular Jamaican festivals, Fantan Mojah recorded several songs on popular riddims, and was signed by Downsound Productions. In 2005, Fantan‚Äôs debut album ‚ÄúHail the King‚Äù was released. It featured popular singles like ‚ÄúHail the King‚Äù, ‚ÄúNuh Build Great Man‚Äù featuring Jah Cure and ‚ÄúCorruption‚Äù.

He has also appeared with Rev side-project Harmony Rockets, his own band Grasshopper and the Golden Crickets, and as a guest musician on numerous other recordings. Early years Mackowiak's early years have been colored by a 1991 interview given to music publication Melody Maker, which claimed that he met Rev singer Jonathan Donahue in Camp Sunshine, a reform camp for juvenile delinquents, at the age of ten. > Grasshopper was throwing dead squirrels and rats into a lawnmower when > Jonathan met him. The blood spattered over a watching group of retarded kids > and they screamed and yelled. They yelled, \\"Now throw the possum in! The > Possum! The possum too!\\" Muses Jonathan, \\"When you're younger, these things > make a more vivid impression. I remember huge adrenaline rushes as the guts > flew and hit people on the legs. I don't know what Grasshopper had done to > get in there. He doesn't talk about it much.\\" The reliability of the story is unknown, though the claim to have met in a reform camp was repeated to the NME in 1998. Grasshopper was born in upstate New York and was introduced to music by his uncle, an Atlantic Records employee who gave him records by John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman and Miles Davis, as well as novels by Jim Carroll. Growing up close to the border, he was in range of Canadian radio stations, further broadening his musical education. In the early 80s, Mackowiak was a member of The People's Front (name taken from the Monty Python film Life of Brian), which played concerts in Fredonia, Dunkirk and Buffalo, NY. There was a film made of the band but has since gone missing. The film showed the band in concert and in a mock documentary with the storyline predicting great success not in the US, but \\"across the pond\\" in England. The film ends with a crash that was a foreshadowing of the fate that befell the actual guitar player for the group, Kyle Gaszynski. Grasshopper undertook a BA in the renowned Media Studies program at the State University of New York at Buffalo (1984‚Äì1988) where he studied with avant-garde filmmakers Tony Conrad and Paul Sharits as well as Viennese action artist Peter Weibel. He later received a master's degree in the same subject at New School University, 1990-1993. While studying at Buffalo around 1986/87, Mackowiak began to play bass guitar with avant garde group Shady Crady, an embryonic Mercury Rev incarnation which also featured Donahue, a member of The Flaming Lips until 1991. These formative years brought him into close contact with other members of the Flaming Lips/Mercury Rev sphere, such as producer Dave Fridmann and early Rev singer David Baker, also a media student. Other activities in the late 1980s included working in the video department of a legal transcription company, as a percussionist for the local Buffalo band Sunny in Chernobyl and as a medical research subject: \\"I did this thing at a medical school where I got paid to take various drugs they were developing. You're in this controlled environment for 3 days and they give you all these drugs then suddenly stop then watch you suffer,\\" he said. Mackowiak is most commonly known by his childhood nickname Grasshopper, derived from how his family's Polish surname translates into the Polish language - \\"from where the poppies grow\\" - and his hyperactive nature as a child. Mercury Rev On stage at Quart Festival, Norway in 2016 Mercury Rev properly began in 1989, with Grasshopper moving to electric guitar and the band playing along to footage of TV wildlife documentaries. The band's first two albums, Yerself Is Steam (1991) and Boces (1993) were intricate yet deafening soundscapes dominated by the feedback-strewn, heavily effects- processed guitars of Grasshopper and Donahue. The spirit of experimentation was manifested by the band's use of the Tettix Wave Accumulator, a homemade tone generator of Grasshopper's invention. Boces, remembered by the band as a particularly troubled record, was recorded under the influence of the drug rohypnol. When asked by Melody Maker in 1993 what he liked most about the album, Grasshopper replied: \\"that it's done.\\" Chaos also manifested itself outside the studio: a legendary, oft-repeated story holds that either Donahue or singer David Baker tried to gouge the guitarist's eye out with a spoon. The band's first UK interview, with the now-defunct Melody Maker in 1991, contained this memorable exchange, reported by Chris Roberts: > I ask Grasshopper's mother, who must be about 50-odd, if she enjoyed the > show. \\"Oh yes,\\" she beams, \\"it induced orgasm.\\" I'm sorry? \\"It induced > orgasm.\\" After 36 hours in the vicinity of Mercury Rev, nothing on earth > should throw me. This does. \\"Can I take your photograph?\\" she asks. I run > away and tell Grasshopper that his band has just sexually aroused his > mother. \\"Uh-huh,\\" he says, like I've just asked him if he wants a beer. > \\"She's kinda cool. And she smokes a lotta dope.\\" The year 1995, however, saw the departure of Rev singer Baker and a radical change in direction for the band, which drew on Broadway, jazz and doo-wop influences helped along by Grasshopper's clarinet. The album See You on the Other Side, and resulting tour, saw the band virtually ignored. With Mercury Rev in disintegration and Donahue suffering a breakdown, Grasshopper retreated to a Jesuit Retreat House monastery in Spain. \\"I was there for six months. Then I left. I mean, you get up at six AM, you make your bed...it was the complete opposite of everything I had been doing for the past six years,\\" he recalled in 1998. Ten years later, he remembered being \\"pretty scrambled up inside and it just helped me to reflect and to bring some brakes on certain things in my life that were spinning out of control ... For anybody who wants to go there, it's highly recommended. Just step out of reality for a second, empty yourself out, all the baggage.\\" Between Rev records, he also issued a solo record under the moniker Grasshopper and the Golden Crickets on the Beggars Banquet label. Orbit of Eternal Grace featured several Rev members, home-made electronic instruments and \\"N.Y. Avenue Playground\\", effectively a draft of \\"The Hudson Line\\", which would appear on the next Mercury Rev album. Around this time, he effected a radical change in appearance by cutting his bottle blond hair into a style which has remained constant since. Grasshopper was also active in Harmony Rockets, a sprawling Mercury Rev side-project responsible for Willy Wonka theme covers and Paralyzed Mind of the Archangel Void, a full-length LP which contrasted ambient drones alongside full-on noise. \\"...Paralyzed Mind is nocturnal trance music that never gets monotonous, a stunning feat for a piece this long.... In 2015 we'll be talking about this mercurial, revolutionary CD in the awed tones reserved for The Velvet Underground & Nico, Revolver, A Love Supreme, or Bitches Brew,\\" claimed Alternative Press in 1996. Reconvening and moving to the Catskill Mountains in these in-between years, the band attempted to record what they deemed likely to be their last chance. The resultant record, Deserter's Songs (1998), was a critical and commercial triumph, leading to an extensive and lengthy tour. With each of the band members in emotionally difficult waters, Grasshopper's contribution on the record drew from the heartfelt death of his uncle. His guitar style, particularly onstage, had evolved from the squalls of the early '90s and was now strongly influenced by the pentatonic blues, albeit retaining an avant-garde edge. In 2001, Grasshopper was injured in a mugging attack which affected the recording of that year's All Is Dream album: > I was at the Jazz Festival in New Orleans, in this bar watching a Cuban > band, with a friend of mine. We were the last ones there. We walked out and > we just went around the wrong corner. It happened really fast. There were > two guys. They had a gun on my friend and they cut me, and took our wallets. > I was bleeding pretty badly. When I went to the hospital, the doctor said, > \\"I don't think this is very good; three of your fingers might be paralyzed.\\" Making a full recovery, the guitar solo on the track 'Little Rhymes' was played with his arm in a sling. 2005's The Secret Migration was performed under less dramatic circumstances. Preparations for 2008's Snowflake Midnight album included a period of withdrawal from the guitar, as the band explored new directions with the introduction of software-based instrumentation. Aside from music, Mackowiak's interests include film and modern literature, particularly of the Beat Generation, The Situationists, Minimalism, Fluxus, and Dada. He lives in Kingston, New York with his wife and two young children. Mackowiak is an avid fan of the New York Yankees and frequently posts about them on his Twitter account. Instruments and musicianship Grasshopper is nominally the group's lead guitarist, credited in the band's peculiar vocabulary with \\"guitar shapes\\" and \\"single-exhaust clarinet\\" in the See You on the Other Side liner notes, and with \\"guitar reels\\" and woodwind on Deserter's Songs. The Secret Migration's 'Moving On' features prominent singing from him and Jeff Mercel, though 'The Hudson Line', on Deserter's Songs and 'Blood on the Moon' on Lego My Ego feature Grasshopper's only lead vocals with Mercury Rev. He also sings backing vocals live. He is credited with playing - and inventing - the Tettix Wave Accumulator on various Rev releases, telling Cokemachineglow: > The Tettix Wave Accumulator is basically a huge bank of oscillators, high > and low pass filters, and wave shape manipulators. It can use any sound > source to manipulate sounds. It also can then sample the manipulated sound > and then store the sound on discs. It is still a very wonderful instrument. > In 1994, when it was developed, we threw together a bunch of existing > technology that hadn't been used together in quite that way before. Now of > course, you can achieve many of these sounds with computer programs like > Reaktor. The Tettix Wave Accumulator is now housed in the basement of a bar. > We were trying to develop a smaller version, but the funds have recently > dried up. You could say that Tettix Inc. has been acquired by the Carlyle > Group. \\"I started out playing clarinet and, I think when I was younger, a lot of my influences were horn players - like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, or John Gillmore, who played with Sun Ra,\\" Grasshopper explained in 2001. \\"Then as I started playing more and more guitar, as a kid I liked [laughs] The Allman Brothers and Neil Young's guitar playing. Then I got into, obviously, Sterling Morrison of The Velvet Underground, and Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd - I love that stuff. I like Robert Quine, who played with Richard Hell, and Lou Reed. I've also got some jazz and punk rock influences, but Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd [are the big ones].\\" On the 2005 Secret Migration tour, he provided additional harmonica, clarinet and electric piano during guitar-less moments. For the creation of Snowflake Midnight, the band bought Macbooks and experimented with various software packages. \\"I was very interested in the Native Instruments programs Absynth and FM8 after seeing some demos about them at an electronic music conference I attended in Miami,\\" Grasshopper explained to Cokemachineglow. His record The Orbit Of Eternal Grace, recorded around 1996 with a loose group dubbed The Golden Crickets, features Grasshopper's vocals, electric, acoustic and bass guitars as well as a Micromoog, Casio PT-30, ENL Synkey, Vox Continental, Mellotron, tape loops, turntables, guitar synth, tone generator, 'rex', alto and tenor saxophones and 'Scotch 201 (1.5mil acetate)' - a type of analogue tape. He has tended to favour Fender Telecasters since the See You on the Other Side tour, often with customisations such as double humbucker pickups and tremolo arms. These have been decorated with NASA stickers, the logo of the American Revolution Bicentenary (used frequently on album artwork)and stars on the headstock. A Fender Tele-sonic made its appearance on the All Is Dream tour, later acquiring a Bigsby tremolo unit. As the band's sound changed radically with the release of Snowflake Midnight, Grasshopper switched to a hardtail, double- humbucker Fender Jaguar and Yamaha electric guitar. He and Donahue both used Fender Hotrod DeVille 4x10 combo amplifiers since 1998's Deserter's Songs tour, but switched to comparable Peavey models to tour Snowflake Midnight in 2008. A Boss GT6 was added to the already-extensive array of assorted pedals in 2005.

It is formed at the confluence of over 30 spring branches emerging from El Tatio area. Flowing briefly south, it turns west and passes through a canyon carved in volcanic rocks. In its middle course, the river receives the Toconce River (originated at the foot of Linzor volcano) from the north and the Caspana River from the south. In this area, a part of the flow of its affluents is diverted for providing water for domestic consumption in Antofagasta and Tocopilla, among other localities. After being joined by the two streams before mentioned, the Salado River enters in a floodplain area, which is used for pasturage by the inhabitants of the nearby localities, including Toconce, Caspana and Aiquina. Then, the Salado again flows through a narrow canyon, where is found the so- called Devil's Bridge, a cut through rhyolite terrain of 5 m wide. Finally, the Salado empties into the Loa River, the main watercourse of the Chilean Norte Grande, about 3 km south of Chiuchiu.

Established in November 2003 following accreditation by the Australian Medical Council (AMC), ANUMS commenced offering studies in the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (M.B., B.S.) (Latin: Medicinae Baccalaureus et Chirurgiae Baccalaureus) program and, under the leadership of the Foundation Dean, Professor Paul Gatenby, the first cohort of students commenced in February 2004. In January 2014 the AMC approved the ANU Medical School changing its medical program to the award of the MChD (Latin: Medicinae ac Chirurgiae Doctoranda) program. The current Dean of Medicine is Professor Imogen Mitchell and Deputy Dean of Medicine Professor Zsuzsoka Kecskes.  History  Walter Burley Griffin‚Äôs plan for the design of Canberra not only designated Acton Peninsula as a hospital site, but did so whilst simultaneously placing it adjacent to a university where he envisaged a medical school would be located. One of the best extant sources of evidence of the geometry and intent of Walter Burley Griffin‚Äôs formally adopted plan for Canberra, is set out in the Report of Federal Capital City Designs of the Board of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia (1912). The Canberra Community Hospital on Acton Peninsula (which was later named the Royal Canberra Hospital ) had possessed a Department of Clinical Science since 1965, its foundation professor being Malcolm Whyte and its laboratories being linked to the Australian National University's (ANU) John Curtin School of Medical Research. Amongst others, Dr Marcus de Laune Faunce advocated that the Royal Canberra Hospital be linked with a medical school at the ANU. In the early 1970s the ANU narrowly missed out on a medical school, which went to the University of Newcastle. HM Whyte in a study of the early moves for a university medical school in Canberra details how the proposal was initiated by a question addressed to the ANU by the Director-General of Health in 1963, considered by hospital and university committees, approved by a report in 1965, bolstered by an international conference in 1968, encouraged by the Universities Commission and fleshed out into a formal submission to the Universities Commission in 1971. A government-funded feasibility study commenced in 1974 and reported in 1976. In July 1976, however, the ANU University Council decided: \\"in view of recent statements on funding for universities...there was no advantage to be had in developing further at present the study so far undertaken\\". The 1980s had seen an involvement in the teaching of a small cohort of final-year students from the University of Queensland in Canberra, and in 1993 the University of Sydney began to develop its Canberra Clinical School. In April 2001, after intense public debate and a committee of inquiry lasting eight months, it was announced that the Australian National University was to develop Australia's 12th and the world's 896th medical school. Shortly afterwards staff at the medical school made a proposal to the National Capital Authority that the old hospice and isolation block facilities on Acton Peninsula (which had been heritage listed for a health use) should be leased to the Medical School for teaching and clinical purposes.  Structure  The first enrolment was in 2004. The ANUMS program is a four-year graduate medical degree, being thematic in concept and using problem based learning as the principal method of instruction particularly in the first two years. The themes include: * Medical Sciences - 45% * Clinical Skills - 30% * Population Health - 15% * Professionalism and Leadership - 10% These themes were selected as being important knowledge and professional domains that medical graduates will need in the 21st century. Doctors require competency in basic medical sciences such as anatomy and physiology as well as defined clinical skills. This includes communicating with patients and their relatives, being able to elicit a history, examine a patient and use the principles of evidence based practice. Population health grows in importance as the world‚Äôs population grows; doctors must appreciate that there are perspectives different from their individual patients' and that great health gains are really only made at the population level. Doctors also require an understanding of health law medical ethics and international human rights as well as an ability to reflect on their own performance and capacity. Teaching is on the ANU campus, particularly in the first two years. Patient contact is from early in the course with much of the last two years taught in the health sector, both in the ACT and in surrounding NSW. In the ACT the principal teaching hospital is the Canberra Hospital. Students also go to Calvary Hospital, to facilities of ACT Community Care and selected general practices. In surrounding NSW a Rural Clinical School has been established. A select group of students will be invited to spend the third year of the course in a rural curriculum that runs parallel to the urban based curriculum. The ANU Medical School has links with the ACT Department of Health and Community Care and the Southern Area Health Service of the NSW Health system. Canberra, the \\"bush capital\\", is very close to the small population centres of south-eastern NSW. The school takes advantage of the diversity of the surrounding area and provides rural experience from very early in the course in locations such as Yass, Queanbeyan, Bega, Batemans Bay, Goulburn and Cooma, all of which are within a few hour's travelling distance of Canberra, as well as Young. Students have the opportunity to spend one of their clinical years in a rural setting, learning medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology synchronously while their urban colleagues rotate through traditional blocs. The medical school houses nationally and internationally renowned academics and clinicians, including Dr. Simon O'Connor, co-author of the popular clinical textbook, Clinical Examination. Admission Admission was previously via a combination of grade point average (GPA) of a previous undergraduate degree and the Graduate Australian Medical School Admissions Test (GAMSAT) weighted 50:50 and a pass/fail interview. From 2013 entry onwards, the GPA and GAMSAT score are weighted 50:50 to produce a ranked list of applicants for the interview, and offers of place are based on a total score of 50:50 weighting of the composite score (used for the interview ranking) and the interview score. Places include Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP), Bonded Medical Places (BMP), Medical Rural Bonded Places (MRBS) and International Full Fee Places (IFP). Teaching hospitals Clinical schools are based at the following major teaching hospitals affiliated with the ANU Medical School: * The Canberra Hospital * National Capital Private Hospital * Calvary Hospital * Calvary John James Hospital * Calvary Private Hospital * Canberra Eye Hospital * Goulburn Base Hospital * Batemans Bay Hospital A number of other smaller hospitals also act as teaching hospitals to participate in rural medical education in the ACT and SE NSW region.

He won with 32% against incumbent Jack Chadirdjian (31%). He served as Montreal's Chairman of the Executive Committee from 1998 to 2001. Fortier did not run for re-election in 2001, citing concerns about organized crime. While in office, Fortier was \\"offered a bribe, blackmailed, pressured to shake down a city consultant to contribute to his political party, and even offered a chance to become the next mayor if he cooperated.\\" https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/from-the-archive-bribes-blackmail- and-city-hall The attempted bribe was linked to developers with ties to organized crime. Fortier's warnings about organized crime infiltrating municipal operations were not taken seriously by his elected colleagues, but Fortier's concerns were a factor that ultimately helped establish the Charbonneau Commission on corruption in Quebec politics. Today, Fortier proposes procedures that could reduce the influence of organized crime, some as simple as rendering public full organizational flow charts, listing all municipal employees.https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal- gazette/20130119/281513633515598 In 2013, Fortier worked with the campaign of mayoral candidate, M√©lanie Joly, and her Vrai Changement Party, but he left before the end of the campaign.

Fortier, who rides a bike 12 months a year, presented much more less costly proposals than his two rivals, advocating premiums for municipal employees who ride to work year-round, rendering the metro (subway) system more accessible to cyclists and putting bike racks on transit buses.http://journalmetro.com/actualites/montreal/1210167/ligne-aerienne-ou- reseau-express-le-velo-au-coeur-des-debats/ Fortier was critical of many big infrastructure projects, particularly the proposed R√©seau √©lectrique m√©tropolitain (REM) train line and the Pink Line metro project, both officially costed at $6 billion.

More than 100,000 people can perform prayer at same time in this eidgah. It is also one of the most visited tourist spots in the city. Recently, the gates were rebuilt to ensure safety and security. As well as for prayer uses and Islamic congregations, the eidgah has historically been a place to give speeches and host rallies by the likes of Mohandas Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. There have also been battles which have took place here such as the Muharram Rebellion. History Entrance at night During the rule of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Farhad Khan was appointed as the faujdar of Sylhet. Farhad Khan supervised the construction of the Shahi Eidgah on a hill in the 17th century. On 16 December 1782 (10 Muharram 1197), the Pirzada of Sylhet two religious leaders, Syed Muhammad Hadi and Syed Muhammad Mahdi (known locally as Hada Miah & Mada Miah), led the first uprising against the British opposition in these grounds. The two brothers marched with their followers to the grounds with the main purpose for a tazia procession, but to also do a sudden attack against the British. However, Robert Lindsay, the colonial supervisor of the district, was already made aware of this and came armed with contingents forcing the rebels to surrender. The rebels declined and revolted and a short battle took place in the grounds. In the aftermath, the leader of the rebels died with Hadi and the Pirzada being shot dead by Lindsay himself. The incident, known as the 1782 Sylhet uprising, was also mentioned in Lindsay's diary while he was going back to Europe. Mohandas Gandhi gave a speech in these grounds as part of his non- cooperation movement, and many other politicians followed after as the years went by such as Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and A. K. Fazlul Huq. Architecture and design Front entrance on the left Although designed like a grand Mughal fort, it is actually meant for Eid prayers. There are 3 gates to enter through and 15 domes. Through the large gate, there is a large pond, known locally as \\"fukoir\\" or \\"fukri\\", which is designated as a wudu khana. The ground contains a large mihrab in the center of the wall, with other smaller mihrabs scattered throughout. Around the borders of the eidgah are also many half-domed minars.

Different celebrities of the day presented poems or short readings in a simple format. The programme was screened at 10:55am each weekday morning, which explains the title. Each episode was four minutes in length. The series was introduced in May 1986 (when BBC1 introduced daytime scheduling at the start of the year) due to an unforeseen gap in the schedule after the 11:45am news bulletin finished. The most common presenter between 1986 and 1989 was Joss Ackland. Other celebrity hosts included Richard Briers, Philip Madoc, Amanda Redman, Annette Crosbie, Judi Dench, Patricia Routledge, Emma Thompson, Joanna Lumley and even Sir Laurence Olivier (in a Christmas special on 24 December 1987). Essentially a variation on Jackanory, Five To Eleven was set in small studio which famously featured \\"dying\\" floral arrangements and a sea-green background. The opening titles and end \\"credits\\" (there were only three, shown in one take) featured a mid-tempo theme tune of panpipes and flutes. In late 1989, the programme underwent some cosmetic changes, being given a new, more contemporary synthesised theme tune and a new set of titles/credits; the sea-green background and floral arrangements were dropped in favour of a scarlet set with a gold backcloth, and the celebrity presenters were dropped and replaced with children of school age. This new format proved less popular with regular audiences, and in 1990 Five To Eleven was cancelled due to falling viewing figures.

The site was investigated in 1960 and 1962 by V.A. Kuznetsov after the slabs with runic inscriptions were found, but without excavations. In 1963 and 1964 archaeological expedition of Karachaevo-Cherkessky research institute, lead by E.P. Alekseeva, conducted excavations in the site.

The fortress, situated downstream from Karachaevsk and formerly accessed only by ladder, occupies some forty hectares on top of a large plateau. The high walls, with twelve bastions, were pierced by a single 5-metre-wide gate. The fortifications are supposed to have been constructed either by the Khazars or by the Bulgars in connection with the Khazar-Arab Wars. The site is rich in pseudo-runic inscriptions, an evidence of early medieval Turkic occupation by tribes of the Saltovo-Mayaki cultural group.

It is located at Clarkson Covered Bridge Park on County Road 1043 (CR 1043) off U.S. Route 278 near the community of Bethel, about 8 mi (13 km) west of Cullman. Originally built in 1904, the 270-ft (82-m) bridge (although some other sources say the bridge is only 250 ft long) is a Town lattice truss construction over four spans. The Clarkson‚ÄìLegg Covered Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 25, 1974. It is currently the second longest existing historic covered bridge in Alabama and third longest overall in the state after the 334-foot (102 m) Twin Creek Covered Bridge in Midway, Alabama and 324-foot (99 m) Swann Covered Bridge in Cleveland, Alabama.Flickr - Twin Creek Covered Bridge, Retrieved Jun. 8, 2020. The bridge is maintained by the Cullman County Commission. History The Clarkson‚ÄìLegg Covered Bridge was constructed over Crooked Creek in 1904 on property owned by local mail carrier James W. Legg at the cost of $1,500. It was originally named the Legg Covered Bridge after the landowner, who saw the need for transportation improvement in the area and even supplied much of the materials. A flood destroyed half of the bridge in 1921. Most of the pieces were recovered downstream, and the bridge was able to be rebuilt the following year, with help from a contractor hired by Cullman County, also at a cost of $1,500. See also: The covered bridge remained in service to motor traffic until 1962, when it was bypassed by a nearby concrete bridge. As part of the American Bicentennial Project, the Clarkson‚ÄìLegg Covered Bridge was restored by the Cullman County Commission in 1975, along with a gristmill and log cabin also located at Clarkson Covered Bridge Park. A number of activities are now held at the park, including an annual event by the county called Old-Fashioned Days. On Christmas Day of 2015, many of the paths and walkways within Clarkson Covered Bridge Park were damaged due to flooding after 8 in (20 cm) of rain fell in a 24-hour period. The covered bridge itself was unharmed. Although the flood was not as significant as the one which occurred in 1921, it did require the park to be closed to the public while repairs were made.

Civil War events During the American Civil War, skirmishes at Crooked Creek and Hog Mountain occurred on April 30, 1863, in the vicinity of where the Clarkson‚ÄìLegg Covered Bridge currently stands. It was part of a series of engagements which took place throughout Cullman County that day as a band of men led by Union Army Colonel Abel Streight were being pursued by forces led by Confederate Army General Nathan Bedford Forrest. This was due to a result of a failed attempt (later known as Streight's Raid) by Colonel Streight's group to cut off the Western & Atlantic Railroad, in Middle Tennessee, which was supplying Confederate Army forces commanded by General Braxton Bragg.

He started guitar lessons with Bob Marshall in Castro Valley and eventually took lessons from Jim Bedford in Hayward, California for about 10 years. He played Jackson Guitars throughout his entire career. Career He began his career in the mid-1980s in a thrash metal band called Militia before joining Forbidden in 1989. He made his recording debut in 1990 with the band on their second album Twisted into Form, co-writing much of the material and bringing a darker and more progressive sound than its predecessor, Forbidden Evil.Metal Storm Calvert played on two more Forbidden albums, Distortion in 1994 and Green in 1997. After the dissolution of Forbidden, Calvert was asked to replace Pat O'Brien in the progressive thrash metal band Nevermore. Nevermore wanted Tim as their second guitarist because lead singer Warrel Dane and bassist Jim Sheppard had toured together with Calvert in the early 1990s when Dane and Sheppard played with Sanctuary and Calvert was in Forbidden. Dane stated in an interview he and Sheppard were amazed by Calvert's technique and were very happy when Tim accepted their invitation. Calvert played on and contributed to their classic concept album Dreaming Neon Black, released in 1999. Calvert left Nevermore in 2000 after the Dreaming Neon Black tour ended to pursue a full-time career as a pilot, attending school and working in Seattle initially before moving to San Luis Obispo, California for his first assignment, then Salt Lake City, Utah and later Minneapolis, Minnesota. His entire professional piloting career was with SkyWest Airlines. In 2010, it was announced Calvert and a number of other prominent metal musicians were supposed to make an appearance on the first album of an AC/DC tribute band formed by Bay Area veteran vocalist Steve \\"Zetro\\" Souza called AC/DZ, but the album has yet to be released.

He was born April 10, 1946 in Dayton, Ohio. While visiting a girlfriend‚Äôs grandmother in New York, he took the opportunity to view works by Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. Observing their smudges, smears, and imperfections, he sensed that he too was capable of such work, and decided to attend art school. Arnoldi attended Ventura College in Ventura, California, where a professor convinced him to apply to the Art Center in Los Angeles. He was accepted with a scholarship, and enrolled in commercial illustration classes. It was the late 1960s, and Arnoldi recalls a stifling classroom environment where male students were required to wear ties. After only two weeks, he left and transferred to the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles in 1968, where he remained for eight months before deciding to abandon his formal education and complete his training through his art practice. Arnoldi began using actual tree branches as a compositional element in his works, combined with painting to create stick constructions. These works did not endeavor to create illusions but rather inhabited physical space. In the early 1970s, the artist attracted attention for his wall-relief wood sculptures, such as Honeymoons in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art. He had his first solo exhibition at the Riko Mizuno Gallery in Los Angeles in 1971. The following year he was included in Documenta V, Kassel, Germany, 1972. In 1977, he had his first stick sculpture cast in bronze. Roark, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is a monumental example of this technique.Honolulu Museum of Art, Spalding House: Self-guided Tour, Sculpture Garden, 2014, p. 10 The use of wood remained a feature of Arnoldi's oeuvre, although, since the 1980s, he has often employed it in combination with other media. In the 1990s, Arnoldi's output changed radically. He began producing abstract paintings on canvas, first black and white, and later brightly colored. Justice is an example of these free-flowing organic paintings. He played himself in the 2005 film, Sketches of Frank Gehry, directed by Sydney Pollack. Arnoldi lives and works in Los Angeles.

Through his coaching career he has coached crews to a total of 25 World Championship medals‚Äîincluding thirteen gold‚Äîand a total of seven Olympic medals‚Äîsix of which were gold.  Early life and rowing career  Dick Tonks' father, Alan Tonks, was an accomplished rower and coach, and it is presumed that his influence was a major factor in Dick's taking up rowing at Wanganui Boys' College at the age of thirteen. He first competed at the Wanganui Secondary Schools Regatta in 1965 and subsequently‚Äîcoached by his father‚Äîrowed in the school's first eight for three years. In 1970, back at the sport, he rowed for Otago in Dunedin and was able to earn a place on the national team in 1971. By 1972 he was stroking the New Zealand coxless four, alongside Ross Collinge, Dudley Storey and Noel Mills. The boat went on to win silver at the Munich Olympics, beaten by half a boat-length by the East German crew. Curiously, Tonks never won a national title, coming second in the single scull to Murray Watkinson in 1974 and never being part of a strong enough club to win in larger boats.  Coaching career  Though he coached while rowing, Tonks returned to coaching in 1989 when he was asked to coach a women's four at the Union club, in Wanganui. As well as drawing Tonks on the path to coaching success, this also led to his second marriage to Florence Matthews, a member of the four. In 1994 world champion scullers Philippa Baker and Brenda Lawson asked Tonks to coach them in the double, leading to gold at Indianapolis, bronze at Tampere in 1995 and making the final at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. After this, Tonks began coaching Rob Waddell, who would go on to win gold in the single scull at Cologne in 1998 and St Catharines in 1999 before taking the gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Until 2000 and his move north to Karapiro, Tonks had treated coaching as a \\"hobby,\\" and was often working full-time, including work for the railways‚Äî\\"pushing paper, 8 to 5\\"‚Äîand nights spinning wool at the Cavalier Bremworth carpet factory. Tonks has been influential in the careers of rowers such as Olympic medallists Caroline and Georgina Evers-Swindell, Mah√© Drysdale, Nicky Coles, Juliette Haigh, Hamish Bond and Eric Murray. He has been the New Zealand rowing coach at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. His contract with Rowing New Zealand was terminated in December 2015 after a public fallout over him having coached top Chinese rowers without having asked for permission from his employer. During the spat, Tonks said about Rowing New Zealand's chief executive Simon Peterson that he \\"couldn't run a bloody corner dairy\\". An arrangement was agreed on by which Tonks would continue to coach Drysdale and the women's double sculls boat (Eve MacFarlane and Zoe Stevenson) until the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in a private capacity. Drysdale won gold at the event, with was the sixth Olympic gold medal of one of Tonks' rowers. On his coaching style, Tonks is reported to have said, \\"good coaching is a dictatorship and I am a dictator.\\" He later admitted to saying this during \\"a very bad year.\\" He also holds that his relationship with his athletes is a professional one, stating: \\"I‚Äôm their coach, not their friend.\\" Mah√© Drysdale has agreed, citing this as the reason he did not invite Tonks to his wedding to Juliette Haigh in 2013. Dick Tonks currently coaches for the Canadian national team in their preparation for the Tokyo Olympics.  Awards  Dick Tonks has won the Halberg Awards' \\"Coach of the year\\" five times‚Äîin 1999, 2004, 2005, 2009 and 2012; more than any other coach in the award's 27-year history‚Äîand has been named a finalist twelve times. He has also been awarded \\"World Rowing coach of the year\\" at the World Rowing Awards three times‚Äî2005, 2010 and 2012‚Äîsince its inception in 2002. Tonks is currently the only person to have won the award more than once. In the 2003 New Year Honours, Tonks was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rowing.

After the sale, Suburban World's two youngest newspapers were closed, while the others remain part of CNC, now owned by GateHouse Media.

Boston Herald, February 16, 2001.

Streamer (Newsletter of the Charles River Watershed Association, Weston, Mass.), page 4, Spring 1999. Accessed August 16, 2007. The newspapers developed a reputation for quality. Kirk Davis, who oversaw Suburban World's competitors in his role as publisher of Community Newspaper Company, said Suburban World did \\"an outstanding job, in some instances a better job than we were doing\\". In 2001, Barrett, 56, decided to sell his newspapers for an undisclosed amount of money to his longtime competitor, which had long expressed an interest in buying Suburban World. The deal came shortly after CNC had been sold to the Boston Herald. The move filled some gaps in CNC's coverage map, but also set up conflicts with previous CNC papers, notably the former MetroWest Tab newspapers. Eventually, the competing Tabs were closed and the Suburban World papers‚Äîmost of which had decades-long histories in their communities, whereas the Tabs dated from the 1990s‚Äîremain in CNC today. Two Suburban World papers were closed, however, prompting some reader backlash in Millis and Norfolk.

White\\" including the six \\"Doom of London\\" science- fiction stories, in which various catastrophes beset London. These include The Four Days' Night (1903), in which London is beset by a massive killer smog; The Dust of Death (1903), in which diphtheria infects the city, spreading from refuse tips and sewers; and The Four White Days (1903), in which a sudden and deep winter paralyses the city under snow and ice. These six stories all first appeared in Pearson's Magazine, and were illustrated by Warwick Goble. He was also a pioneer of the spy story, and in 2003, his series The Romance of the Secret Service Fund (written in 1899) was edited by Douglas G. Greene and published by Battered Silicon Dispatch Box.  Life  Fred Merrick White was born in 1859 in West Bromwich, a small town near Birmingham, England. The record of his birth indicates that he was born in the June quarter and that his first name was actually \\"Fred\\" ‚Äî not, as is often assumed, \\"Frederick\\". His second name, \\"Merrick\\", was the maiden name of his mother, Helen, who married his father, Joseph, in West Bromwich in the September quarter of 1858.RGLibrary Bibliography At the time of the 1861 census Joseph and Helen White were living with their son at 18 Carters Green, West Bromwich. The census record gives Joseph's occupation as \\"solicitor's managing clerk.\\" Ten years later the family was living in Hereford, a county town in West England. Before becoming a full-time writer, White followed in his father's footsteps, working as a solicitor's clerk in Hereford. By the time of the 1881 census, Joseph White, Sr., was a fully-fledged solicitor and was now quite prosperous. In 1891 White was working full-time as a journalist and author, presumably earning enough to support himself and his mother, Helen, who, in the census record for that year figures as the head of the household in the Barton Road villa. In the June quarter of the following year, 1892, White married Clara Jane Smith. The wedding took place at King's Norton, Worcestershire, and the couple had two children. In the 1911 census, Fred M. White, aged 52, and his wife Clara were living at Uckfield, a town in East Sussex. During the First World War, White's sons served as junior officers in The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. In November 1915 the elder boy, Sydney Eric, was gazetted as a Second Lieutenant (on probation). The First World War and his sons' war-time experiences evidently influenced White's writing during and after this conflict. His novel 'The Seed of Empire' (1916) describes some of the early trench warfare in great detail and the places and events are historically accurate. A number of novels published in the 1920s concern the social changes caused by the war and the difficulties of ex-soldiers in fitting back into normal civilian life. Fred and Clara spent their final years in Barnstaple in the County of Devon, an area which provided the backdrop for his novels The Mystery of Crocksands, The Riddle of the Rail and The Shadow of the Dead Hand. White died in Barnstaple in December 1935, his wife, Clara Jane, died in March 1940.  Works  = Novels = =Short fiction= The following items are from the list published by Roy Glashan.

Route description SR-29 begins at the Emery County line, in the Manti-La Sal National Forest, paralleling the San Rafael River. Near the county line is also Joe's Valley State Park and Joe's Valley Reservoir, where the road diverts around the reservoir to the north, then resumes an east south-easterly course about into Orangeville. Just off SR-29, about west north-west of Orangeville, is the Wilberg Mine, location of a fire that took 27 lives in 1984. Just west of Orangeville SR-29 intersects with SR-57. After Orangeville it continues about four miles (6 km) to where it terminates at the junction with State Route 10, four miles (6 km) east of Orangeville, and three miles (5 km) north of Castle Dale.

The branch was split off as SR-57 in 1931. Due to the creation of Joe's Valley Reservoir, a new alignment was defined in 1965, adding about 4 miles (6.5 km) to the length; the legislature removed the portion west of the reservoir (Ephraim Canyon Road) from the state highway system in 1969.

From October 1942 to December 1945 she was a United States Navy stores ship in the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II. She was scrapped in 1953. United Fruit Company =Building= Workman, Clark and Company of Belfast, Northern Ireland built San Benito in 1921, launching her on 12 August. British Thomson-Houston built her turbo generator and electric propulsion motor. The turbo generator also powered her electric refrigeration equipment. =Owners and managers= Until 1930 San Benito was owned by the United Fruit Company, which registered her in Glasgow, Scotland and contracted the British company of Clark and Service to manage her. In 1930 or 1931 United Fruit transferred San Benito to its subsidiary Balboa Shipping Company, Inc, which registered her under the Panamanian flag of convenience. =Subsequent turbo-electric ships= After San Benito, Balboa Shipping ordered further turbo-electric refrigerated ships. In 1930 Workman, Clark built for Balboa and Cammell Laird of Birkenhead, England built Musas sister ship . After 1930 Balboa's diesel electric motor vessel was re-engined as a turbo-electric. In 1931‚Äì33 Newport News Shipbuilding and Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation supplied six passenger and refrigerated cargo liners that in the Second World War were requisitioned as the s. US Navy service On 20 August 1942 San Benito was renamed Taurus and designated AF-25, and on 2 October 1942 the War Shipping Administration acquired her for the US Navy. The Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation in Alameda, California converted her into a provisions store ship, and on 28 October 1942 she was commissioned into the Navy, commanded by Lt. Cmdr. Edward T. Collins. =World War II Pacific Theatre operations= After over a month of false starts and technical problems, Taurus finally loaded cargo and left San Francisco, California, on 1 December. Her voyage to the South Pacific Ocean took her via Pago Pago, Samoa, to Auckland, New Zealand. On the voyages the ship suffered at least 32 more technical failures and lost a third of her cargo through the failure of her refrigeration plant. On arrival at Auckland, Taurus went into a five-week availability to correct as many of the deficiencies as possible before beginning her tour of duty with the Service Squadron, South Pacific Force. Repairs were completed in the first week in February 1943 and Taurus loaded cargo bound for Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides. On 9 February she began the first of four round-trip voyages carrying cargo between Auckland and Espiritu Santo to be staged on to the forward areas. By August her sphere of operations was widened to include the Solomon Islands. On each of her next six voyages Taurus took cargo from Auckland via Espiritu Santo to Guadalcanal. Through 1944 and much of 1945 Taurus continued to operate in the South Pacific on relatively uneventful supply missions. Early in 1944 she added Napier, New Zealand, and Noumea, New Caledonia, to her ports of call. By late April she was operating as far north in the Solomons as New Georgia and Bougainville. In May and June she visited Efate, Napier, Noumea, and Espiritu Santo. In July and September she made resupply runs to the Russell Islands in the Solomons. Through the end of 1944 and in the first three months of 1945, Taurus continued supplying the Solomons; primarily to Guadalcanal, Bougainville, and the Russells. After overhaul at Auckland from 6 March to 16 April 1945, Taurus left for Hollandia, New Guinea. Through the end of August, all her voyages ‚Äî save one to Manus in the Admiralty Islands ‚Äî were between Auckland and Hollandia. She returned to Auckland on 30 August and departed again nine days later for New Caledonia and thence to the Philippines. After a stop at Noumea between 12 and 14 September, Taurus arrived at Samar on the 25th. =End-of- war duties= From Samar, Taurus began her voyage back to the United States. By 23 November she had transited the Panama Canal and had reported for duty with the US Atlantic Fleet. Though originally ordered to Norfolk, Virginia, she was rerouted to New Orleans, Louisiana. She reported to the Commandant, 8th Naval District, on 29 November 1945. On 11 December 1945 Taurus was decommissioned and returned, via the War Shipping Administration, to her owner. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 3 January 1946. =Military awards and honors= Taurus crew members were awarded the following medals: *American Campaign Medal *Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal *World War II Victory Medal References External links * 1921 ships Ships built in Belfast Ships of the United Fruit Company Stores ships of the United States Navy Turbo-electric steamships World War II auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"USS Taurus (AF-25)"},{"id":"12803304","text":"\\"One Word\\" is the second official single from Elliott Yamin's self-titled album Elliott Yamin (following his first single \\"Wait for You\\" and the radio- only promotional hit \\"Movin' On\\") Song information \\"One Word\\" is a midrange tempo ballad in which Yamin sings about how grateful he is for his love.

The church was built at the end of the tenth century, and is located on the territory of modern Karachay-Cherkessia Republic, Russia. The building has a crossed-dome plan, with an inscribed cross, which is a variation of the North Zelenchuk Church.  Location  The church is located on the southeastern spur of Mount Shoan (), on the left bank of the Kuban river, in a strategically important place not far from confluence of the two rivers: Kuban and Teberda (). The church is located 7 km to the north from the city of Karachayevsk (), above the Ossetian village named after Kosta Khetagurov.  Architecture  The church is constructed according to the Byzantine architectural tradition. It has three apses, which are a little bit narrower than naves (of which there are also three). It is a cross-domed building with four square pillars bearing three-stage arches and a cupola. The length of the building from west to east is 12.9 m., The height is equal to the length, the width along the western facade is 8.9 m. The church has two closed vaulted narthexes at the northern and southern end. It is not clear what was the original form of the roof. At the moment, there is a restored gable roof, but there is a theory about the original roof tiles being rested on semi-circular zacomari-gables.–ê.–Æ. –í–∏–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥–æ–≤, –î.–í. –ë–µ–ª–µ—Ü–∫–∏–π. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∏ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Ö—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ê–ª–∞–Ω–∏–∏. ‚Äî in print. The tholobate is octahedral and has eight windows, each side of the tholobate is ended with the archivolt overhang on consoles rested on the corners. Modern tholobate being milti-faced does not rely on any scientific evidence. The plinthite, which is traditional for Georgian and Byzantine buildings, is used only in the arches. The rest of the building is composed of sandstone-with-lime blocks of rough processing, with a butoconcrete filling inside the wall. The windows are crowened not with an arch of plinthite, but with a stone with a semi-circular finish carved in it. Numerous holes for scaffolding are visible in the masonry, and in the hole in the western part of the southern wall there is even a piece of wood that the builders could not remove and just saw it off. For the construction of the church powerful substructions were required. The facade decor of the church is very modest: there is a cornice made of stone tiles, plinthite stones on the drum and stone cornice above some the windows. Outside the church was covered with a thin layer of plastering (can be seen in the voids between some stone tiles), and inside it was plastered and decorated with ornaments.  History  View from the west The slope, on which the church is located, was previously densely populated, as evidenced by the remains of numerous ancient buildings. Although the original function of the church remains unknown, a large number of burials were found in the settlement, as well as inside the church itself. The Shoan church is essentially a smaller copy of North Zelenchuk Church (besides Shoan having no narthex and western porch). Indisputable proof of copying is a characteristic combination of the eastern corner cells and the side bema into a single compartiment with one blind arch on the side wall. Russian historians A.Vinogradov and D. Beletsky believe that the church was built by a local builders, who repeated a known pattern, but they were technically better trained than previous builders and could freely interpret the chosen form. It is very difficult to associate the builders with a particular architectural school. There is no written evidence to accurately date the church. Only the picturesque scenery of the church sheds some light on its dating. The remains of the frescoes can be associated with the second layer of the painting in the Senty Church. Therefore, presumably the Shoan church was built in the late 10th - early 11th centuries. Thus, the Shoan church was built after the Middle Zelenchuk (950-960s), Senty (965) and North Zelenchuk (late 960s - 970s) churches; it belongs to the third stage of the temple construction in Alania after returning to Christianity around 950. At the end of the XIX century, Shoan church was turned into the church of the Alexander-Athos monastery. The temple was re-plastered, the roof was replaced, and the chapels were rebuilt. In 2007 residents of the village of Kosta Khetagurov made an unauthorized repair of the church after a series of appeals to the government of the Karachay-Cherkessia Republic.

Vitruvius had claimed in his work De architectura that architecture is a science that can be comprehended rationally. This formulation was taken up and further developed in the architectural treatises of the Renaissance. Progressive art theory of the 18th-century opposed the Baroque use of illusionism with the classic beauty of truth and reason. Twentieth-century Rationalism derived less from a special, unified theoretical work than from a common belief that the most varied problems posed by the real world could be resolved by reason. In that respect, it represented a reaction to Historicism and a contrast to Art Nouveau and Expressionism. The term Rationalism is commonly used to refer to the wider International Style. Enlightenment rationalism Project for an Isaac Newton memorial by √âtienne-Louis Boull√©e. The name Rationalism is retroactively applied to a movement in architecture that came about during the Age of Enlightenment (more specifically, Neoclassicism), arguing that architecture's intellectual base is primarily in science as opposed to reverence for and emulation of archaic traditions and beliefs. Rationalist architects, following the philosophy of Ren√© Descartes emphasized geometric forms and ideal proportions. The French Louis XVI style emerged in the mid-18th century with its roots in the waning interest of the Baroque period. The architectural notions of the time gravitated more and more to the belief that reason and natural forms are tied closely together, and that the rationality of science should serve as the basis for where structural members should be placed. Towards the end of the 18th century, Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand, a teacher at the influential √âcole Polytechnique in Paris at the time, argued that architecture in its entirety was based in science. Other architectural theorists of the period who advanced rationalist ideas include Abb√© Jean-Louis de Cordemoy (1631‚Äì1713), the Venetian Carlo Lodoli (1690‚Äì1761), Abb√© Marc-Antoine Laugier (1713‚Äì1769) and Quatrem√®re de Quincy (1755‚Äì1849). The architecture of Claude Nicholas Ledoux (1736‚Äì1806) and √âtienne-Louis Boull√©e (1728‚Äì1799) typify Enlightenment rationalism, with their use of pure geometric forms, including spheres, squares, and cylinders. Structural rationalism The term structural rationalism most often refers to a 19th-century French movement, usually associated with the theorists Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc and Auguste Choisy. Viollet-le-Duc rejected the concept of an ideal architecture and instead saw architecture as a rational construction approach defined by the materials and purpose of the structure. The architect Eug√®ne Train was one of the most important practitioners of this school, particularly with his educational buildings such as the Coll√®ge Chaptal and Lyc√©e Voltaire. Early 20th-century rationalism Casa del Fascio in Como, Italy, designed by Giuseppe Terragni. Architects such as Henri Labrouste and Auguste Perret incorporated the virtues of structural rationalism throughout the 19th century in their buildings. By the early 20th century, architects such as Hendrik Petrus Berlage were exploring the idea that structure itself could create space without the need for decoration. This gave rise to modernism, which further explored this concept. More specifically, the Soviet Modernist group ASNOVA were known as 'the Rationalists'. Rational Architecture (Italian: Architettura razionale) thrived in Italy from the 1920s to the 1940s. In 1926, a group of young architects ‚Äì Sebastiano Larco, Guido Frette, Carlo Enrico Rava, Adalberto Libera, Luigi Figini, Gino Pollini, and Giuseppe Terragni (1904‚Äì43) founded the so-called Gruppo 7, publishing their manifesto in the magazine Rassegna Italiana. Their declared intent was to strike a middle ground between the classicism of the Novecento Italiano movement and the industrially inspired architecture of Futurism. Their \\"note\\" declared: University of Rome campus in 1938 One of the first rationalist buildings was the Palazzo Gualino in Turin, built for the financier Riccardo Gualino by the architects Gino Levi-Montalcini and Giuseppe Pagano. Gruppo 7 mounted three exhibitions between 1926 and 1931, and the movement constituted itself as an official body, the Movimento Italiano per l'Architettura Razionale (MIAR), in 1930. Exemplary works include Giuseppe Terragni's Casa del Fascio in Como (1932‚Äì36), The Medaglia d'Oro room at the Italian Aeronautical Show in Milan (1934) by Pagano and Marcello Nizzoli, and the Fascist Trades Union Building in Como (1938‚Äì43), designed by Cesare Cattaneo, Pietro Lingeri, Augusto Magnani, L. Origoni, and Mario Terragni. Pagano became editor of Casabella in 1933 together with Edoardo Persico. Pagano and Persico featured the work of the rationalists in the magazine, and its editorials urged the Italian state to adopt rationalism as its official style. The Rationalists enjoyed some official commissions from the Fascist government of Benito Mussolini, but the state tended to favor the more classically inspired work of the National Union of Architects. Architects associated with the movement collaborated on large official projects of the Mussolini regime, including the University of Rome (begun in 1932) and the Esposizione Universale Roma (EUR) in the southern part of Rome (begun in 1936). The EUR features monumental buildings, many of which evocative of ancient Roman architecture, but absent ornament, revealing strong geometric forms. Neo-rationalism In the late 1960s, a new rationalist movement emerged in architecture, claiming inspiration from both the Enlightenment and early-20th-century rationalists. Like the earlier rationalists, the movement, known as the Tendenza, was centered in Italy. Practitioners include Carlo Aymonino (1926‚Äì2010), Aldo Rossi (1931‚Äì97), and Giorgio Grassi. The Italian design magazine Casabella featured the work of these architects and theorists. The work of architectural historian Manfredo Tafuri influenced the movement, and the University Iuav of Venice emerged as a center of the Tendenza after Tafuri became chair of Architecture History in 1968. A Tendenza exhibition was organized for the 1973 Milan Triennale. Rossi's book L'architettura della citt√†, published in 1966, and translated into English as The Architecture of the City in 1982, explored several of the ideas that inform Neo-rationalism. In seeking to develop an understanding of the city beyond simple functionalism, Rossi revives the idea of typology, following from Quatrem√®re de Quincy, as a method for understanding buildings, as well as the larger city. He also writes of the importance of monuments as expressions of the collective memory of the city, and the idea of place as an expression of both physical reality and history. Architects such as Leon Krier, Maurice Culot, and Demetri Porphyrios took Rossi's ideas to their logical conclusion with a revival of Classical Architecture and Traditional Urbanism. Krier's witty critique of Modernism, often in the form of cartoons, and Porphyrios's well crafted philosophical arguments, such as \\"Classicism is not a Style\\", won over a small but talented group of architects to the classical point of view. Organizations such as the Traditional Architecture Group at the RIBA, and the Institute of Classical Architecture attest to their growing number, but mask the Rationalist origins. In Germany, Oswald Mathias Ungers became the leading practitioner of German rationalism from the mid-1960s. Ungers influenced a younger generation of German architects, including Hans Kollhoff, Max Dudler, and Christoph M√§ckler.

Purpose  Sand cores are used to form the internal cavities when the engine block or cylinder head(s) is cast. These cavities are usually the coolant passages. Holes are designed into the casting to support internal sand forms, and to facilitate the removal of the sand after the casting has cooled. These holes have no purpose after the sand has been removed, therefore a core plug is a cap at the end of these passages, to prevent water or coolant leaking from the engine.  Design  Core plugs are usually thin metal cups press fitted into the casting holes, but may be made of rubber or other materials. In some high-performance engines the core plugs are large diameter cast metal threaded pipe plugs. Core plugs can often be a source of leaks due to corrosion caused by cooling system water. Although modern antifreeze chemicals do not evaporate and may be considered \\"permanent\\", anti-corrosion additives gradually deplete and must be replenished. The slang term \\"freeze plug\\" is derived from the many years ago in situations where the water in an engine block could freeze (due to plain water being used in winter rather than anti-freeze coolant). The expansion of the water as it froze would cause the core plug to pop out of the engine, leading to the term \\"freeze plug\\". Welch plug The Welch plug is a type of core plug that is made from a thin disc of metal. The Welch plug is dome- shaped and inserted into the casting hole with the convex side facing outwards. When installed by striking the Welch plug with a hammer, the dome collapses slightly, expanding it laterally to seal the hole. This differs from other dish-shaped core plug designs, which form a seal when their tapered sides are pressed into the casting hole. The Welch plug was originally designed in the 1900s at the Welch Motor Car Company in the United States. Prior to the invention of the Welch plug, the core holes were sealed using pipe plugs. During the testing of a car, one of the pipe plugs backed out. In order to get back on the road, one of the Welch brothers installed a press-fit quarter or half dollar coin into the hole using a hammer. The design of the Welch plug was refined based on this principle of a press-fit metallic disc.

She was responsible for delivering necessary goods and equipment to ships and stations in the war zone. Octans (AF‚Äì26) was built as SS Ulua in 1917 by Workman Clark and Co., Ltd., Belfast; acquired by the Navy 8 May 1943 under charter through the War Shipping Administration from her owner, the United Fruit Co.; and commissioned 11 June, Lt. Comdr. Otto J. Stein in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Following two weeks of fitting out at Oakland, California, Octans departed San Francisco Bay on 25 June 1943, bound for Noumea, New Caledonia. Arriving there 17 July, she took up her mission of transporting fresh and frozen provisions from New Zealand and Australian ports to ships and bases located in the Solomons, the Admiralties, and New Guinea.  Transporting wounded soldiers  During an availability at Sydney, Australia, in November 1944, another capability and task was added with the installation of a 30-bed sick bay. On succeeding trips to Australia from more- advanced bases, wounded soldiers and sailors were transferred from the battle areas to recovery havens.  Shooting down a Japanese plane in the Philippines  From that time also, Octans began to range farther to the north as she made supply trips to Leyte, Mindoro, and Luzon. While returning from Leyte Gulf on 1 January 1945, she was credited with downing one of a number of Japanese planes which attacked her convoy.  Post-war activity  With almost two years of supply duty behind her, Octans returned to the U.S. West Coast for a brief overhaul, arriving at Oakland 15 May. Seven weeks later, following a stop in Seattle, Washington, for provisions, she again crossed the Pacific Ocean, arriving at Manila on 13 August. After two more trips to Australia, the stores ship made deliveries to Shanghai, China, and departed 29 December for the United States.  Post-war decommissioning  Octans sailed to the U.S. East Coast and arrived in Baltimore, Maryland, on 20 February 1946.

The island is the second largest in Lake Temagami, after Temagami Island. Its community is known as Bear Island 1. Temagami First Nation (TFN) members are status Indians under the Indian Act that live on and off Bear Island. The Teme-Augama Anishnabai (\\"Deep Water by the Shore People\\") are part of the (Anishinaabe) people, and Bear Island represents only a small portion of the Anishinaabe's Nindakiiminan (\\"our land\\"; locally syncoped as Ndakiimnan or \\"n'daki menan\\"), which includes over ten thousand square kilometers of land in the area. Some citizens are status Indian (TFN) within the framework of the Indian Act. The majority are not accorded status under the Indian Act, but are still recognized as full community members by the Teme-Augama Anishnabai.  Human occupation  The Temagami First Nation website states, \\"The Teme-Augama Anishnabai have utilized the Temagami region of Canada for over 9,000 years.\\" Scientific evidence of early occupation of the area is sparse. Lake Temagami was free of glacial ice at about 12,150 cal B.P. There is scientific evidence that the Three Pines site, located at Sand Point on the hub of Lake Temagami near Bear Island, could have been occupied after 7,500 B.P. The Three Pines site includes artifacts similar those found elsewhere that dated to the Archaic Period (7,000-3,000 B.P.). There is radiocarbon-dated evidence of human occupation 8488 ¬± 105 cal B.P. 130 km to the west at Fox Lake and 5791 ¬± 275 cal B.P. to the north east where the Montreal River empties in to Lake Timiskaming.  The reserve  The reserve is situated on a one square mile Island in the pristine Temagami Wilderness and Bear Island is home to over 200 permanent residents out of a total of over 500 registered members. Community Days, held in late summer each year, bring back a large part of the full membership as it is an opportunity to renew friendships and family ties and participate in annual Band Council elections. The Band Council of Temagami First Nation is currently composed of Chief Arnold Paul, Second Chief John Turner, Councillors: Micheal Paul, Wayne Potts, Alice Moore, Jamie Friday, Jamie Saville and Doug Mckenzie Sr. The council was elected in July 2017 for a 3 year Term.  History  The Temagami Indigenous people built homes on Bear Island in the 1880s in addition to homes on their own family lands. In 1943, Bear Island was purchased by the Department of Indian Affairs from the Province of Ontario, for the sum of $3,000.00, in order to be designated as a permanent reserve. The Temagami First Nation refused to accept Bear Island as a reserve until they were denied housing subsidy funds in 1968 until it was agreed, under duress, that Bear Island would become an official Reserve in accordance with the Indian Act of Canada. Official reserve status was granted in 1971 and the establishment of the Band Office occurred shortly after in the former Department of Lands and Forests building which had been constructed in approximately 1903. Maple Mountain in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park is a sacred site of the Temagami First Nation. The Teme-Augama Anishnabai call the mountain Chee-bay-jing, meaning \\"the place where the spirits go\\". It is considered the most sacred and powerful place within their realm. In 1973, Chief Gary Potts of the Temagami Indian Band registered a land caution against The Crown, in Ontario, to stop development on the traditional territory of 10,000 square kilometres, which had been appropriated as Crown land. The Attorney-General of Ontario pursued legal action against the Band for this caution. While the TAA lost this court case in 1984, the Band proceeded with an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada where in 1991 it was adjudicated that the Crown had breached its fiduciary obligations to the Temagami Indians and adhered the Band to the 1850 Robinson Huron Treaty. In 1988, the Ontario Minister of Natural Resources, Vince Kerrio, approved the expansion of the Red Squirrel logging road, directly through disputed territory. This prompted a series of roadblocks by the TAA in 1988-1989. Environmentalists and allies provided strong and continued public support. In 1991, the Wendeban Stewardship Authority was created by the TAA and the Ontario government to manage four townships near the logging road. A land use plan was completed by the authority, however there was no funding nor workers to implement the plan. In February 1995 the authority started winding down and was replaced with the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Council. A Draft Settlement Agreement has been developed but a decision to accept the agreement by the community is yet to be determined.

Origin of the name There was a big market in the area, which Holwell called Charles Bazar. The present designation was conferred upon it by Sobharam Basak, in honour of Shyam Rai (or Radha Gobinda / Krishna) the worshipped deity.. . The Basaks and the Setts were amongst the first to have settled in Sutanuti, after having cleared the jungles. Sobharam Basak was one of the wealthiest native inhabitants of 18th century Kolkata.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, 1909/1980, p. 291, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd. Five-point Crossing Growth and development of the neighbourhood and surrounding localities largely followed the construction of roads that opened up the area. The Oldest road in the crossing is Jessore Road (National Highway 12). Sutanuti had no roads, except the pilgrim path extending across it from Halisahar to Barisha. Chitpur Road (renamed Rabindra Sarani) was developed along this path. It passes through neighbouring Bagbazar and Chitpur. Road construction picked up in the early 19th century. The Lottery Commission (1817) and its successor the Lottery Committee (1836) opened up the native parts of old Kolkata. The main axial thrusts were from south to the north, parallel to the existing ChowringheeChitpur alignment.Lahiri Choudhury, Dhriti Kanta, Trends in Calcutta Architecture, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, p.171 The three- mile long Maratha Ditch was excavated in 1742 as a protection against the marauding Maratha soldiers then foraging in the countryside but who never came.Lahiri Choudhury, Dhriti Kanta, p 157 It was filled up in 1799 to build the Circular Road, that ran from Shyambazar, right around old Kolkata, covering the southern end of the Maidan. It was metalled in the early 19th century. Around the same time, the most important axial thoroughfare from south to north -- Wood Street (portion renamed Dr. Martin Luther King Sarani), Wellesley Street (renamed Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road), Wellington Street (renamed Nirmal Chandra Sarani) and College Street -- was built by the Lottery Committee. The new road to Barrackpore (now called Barrackpore Trunk Road), Cornwallis Street (now called Bidhan Sarani), Upper Circular Road (now called Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road) and the extension of Central Avenue (the Shyambazar end is now called Bhupendra Bose Avenue), which was built by the Kolkata Improvement Trust formed in 1911, also converged on the same point, making Shyambazar five-point crossing and one of the busiest street crossings in Kolkata.Nair, P.Thankappan, Civic and Public Services in Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, pp. 235-6 Shyambazar is connected to Tala and Paikpara with Barrackpore Bridge (over a canal) and Hemanta Setu (Tala Rail Overbridge) along Barrackpore Trunk Road (B.T. Road).Google maps Tala Bridge was firstly inaugurated in 1936. Horse drawn tram cars were introduced up to Shyambazar in 1882 and in 1899, Calcutta Tramways Company Limited introduced electric traction. In 1902 the entire system was electrified. Subsequently, tramways were extended to Belgachia. In 1941, tram tracks were laid along Circular Road. Circular Road had a garbage clearance light railway up to the early fifties. For many years tram cars were the only form of mass transport in Kolkata. Although the first motor car appeared in Kolkata in 1896, motor bus services started only in 1920. Shyambazar tram depot is on Bidhan Sarani, near the five-point crossing. Kolkata tram route no. 5 starts from here. The Shyambazar metro station of Kolkata Metro is also located at Shyambazar fivepoint crossing. BelgachiaShyambazar section, along with Dum DumBelgachia stretch, was opened on 13 August 1994 and the ShyambazarShovabazarGirish Park and Chandni ChowkCentral sections were opened on 19 February 1995. Services on the entire stretch of Metro, from Dum Dum to Tollygunge were introduced from 27 September 1995. While most of the metro railway was constructed by the cut and cover process, the ShyambazarBelgachia stretch was constructed by tunnelling. Shopping Shyambazar is the focal point of shopping in north Kolkata. In fabrics and clothing, it can match College Street-MG Road crossing in Central Kolkata or Gariahat in South Kolkata. In Jewellery, it can match Bowbazar in Central Calcutta or Gariahat in South Kolkata. The once famous house of jewellers, M B Sircar of Shyambazar, Senco Gold, has given way to numerous shops of descendants using variations of the name, all across the city. In sweet meat, the old favourites of Shyambazar are Dwarik Ghosh and Sen Mahasay. In Fariapukur which is an important street connecting Bidhan Sarani and APC road, there was once the office of Bichitra Press where Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay sometimes visited. Old timers will remember shops such as sweet-meat seller Jalajog or a popular restaurant like Golbari. New shops like that of KC Dass and Aminia Restaurant has also been opened. In traditional Bengali families, new clothes are a must for the Bengali New Year. Srineketan, CitiMart, Baazar Kolkata, Brand Mart are the major shopping mall of the region. Although few old renowned clothing shop existing just beside Shyamazar Crossing are Haralalka Pvt Ltd, Young Bengal Society, K.C. Dass etc. All renowned Jewelry brand shops are located on the two sides of Bidhan Sarani. Braving the scorching afternoon heat and drizzles in the evening, people throng at roadside shops for the Chaitra sale offering attractive concessions. Shyambazar vies with New Market and Gariahat as the most crowded markets in Kolkata. The ShyambazarHatibagan area also caters extensively to customers on the eve of Durga Puja and for weddings, apart from daily necessities. A newspaper columnist wrote, \\"A formidable matron with husband and children in tow wading through the crowds at Gariahat and Shyambazar is a familiar sight on the eve of Poila Baishakh.\\" Shyambazar has two regular markets -- Shyambazar and Hatibagan. As Shyambazar is a popular shopping area, the footpaths have virtually been taken over by hawkers, who spread out their fare all over the place. It may be recalled that Kolkata Municipal Corporation had conducted Operation Sunshine in 1996 to remove hawkers from Gariahat and Shyambazar. Following the hawker removal drive, KMC had issued a notification imposing certain restrictions on the movement of hawkers on 21 streets in the city. However, everything seems to be back to the square one. In 2002, a decision was taken by the KMC to keep one-third of the pavement vacant for passers-by.  Medical Facilities  R. G. Kar Medical College and Hospital Shyambazar is also the focal point of medical treatment for the North Kolkata and its Suburban areas. R. G. Kar Medical College and Hospital, one of the biggest and oldest medical college in Kolkata is located close to Shyambazar Five Point crossing. The area is also crowded with nursing homes and famous are Life Line, Dreamland Nursing Home, North Land Nursing Homes, Nirnoy Nursing Homes. Renowned private hospitals like Navajeevan Hospital, Sanjeevani hospital are also located here. N.C. Paul Clinic, Serum Analysis Center, Doyen diagnostic centers are in Shyambazar area. Renowned and popular hearing aid and hearing testing center Shrobonee's main office located here. A large number farmacy shops like Dwanantary, Life Line Pharmacy, Metro Pharmacy, Frank Ross Pharmacy etc. Sports As Shyambazar is a crowded residential and shopping locality, there are few play grounds here. However, Mohun Bagan AC, one of Kolkata's leading sports clubs, had its first play ground at what is now Mohun Bagan Row. A plaque announces that the first play ground was in Mohun Bagan Villa from 1889 to 1892. Kolkata has a deep passion for football but other sports too have developed with time and have gained their share of importance and popularity as well. Tennis is one of them. Shyambazar Tennis Club operates regularly at Deshbandhu Park. Entertainment Shyambazar has traditionally been an entertainment neighbourhood. Nabin Chandra Basu staged the first Bengali production Bidyasundar at his Shyambazar home theatre in 1835. Later in the 19th century, crucial roles were played by Bagbazar Amateur Theatre and Shyambazar Natya Samaj, in highlighting the demand for public commercial theatres open to the public, as opposed to private home theatres of the rich.Raha, Kiranmay, Calcutta Theatre 1835-1944, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, p. 188 Nandikar, one of the leading theatre groups in Kolkata is based in Shyambazar. With ten cinema halls -- Radha, Shree, Uttara, Bishwarupa, Purnashree, Rupbani, Minar, Mitra, Talkie Show House and Darpana -- in a row along Bidhan Sarani, Shyambazar was called cinema neighbourhood. The Bengali films that they screened were particularly popular with the housewives, who used to crowd the afternoon shows. Talkie Show House in Phariapikur was an outlet mostly for English films. With the advent of television both theatre and cinema has been badly hit. However recently a reconstructured townhouse called Calcutta Bungalow in Shyambazar is gaining audience from international and national tourists.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since March 5, 1992. This building was the second of three similarly- Italianate buildings built in Portland by prolific local architect A.E. Doyle's firm. The project's primary designer, Charles K. Greene, worked on the trio of Italianate Doyle-commissioned buildings in Portland: the smaller Bank of California Building (also completed in 1924), the Pacific Building, and the Public Service Building (a skyscraper completed in 1928). A young Pietro Belluschi started his career with A.E. Doyle working on this building, and later in it. Upon its opening in 1926, Doyle moved his firm's headquarters into the Pacific Building.King, Bart (2001). An Architectural Guidebook to Portland, p. 12. Gibbs Smith. The lobby of the 10-story building was designed by Belluschi, and connected to Portland's first underground parking garage. The connection to the parking garage was lost in 2000 when the former bus station to the south (which sat on top of the garage) was torn down and replaced by an annex to the nearby Hilton Hotel. Architecturally, the Pacific Building appears to combine the Chicago School with Italian Renaissance architecture. The red tile roof and dormers combine with geometric windows that are almost flush with the facade to achieve this effect.King, Bart (2001). An Architectural Guidebook to Portland, p. 11. Gibbs Smith. The lot upon which the Pacific Building stands is across Yamhill Street from Pioneer Courthouse, in the heart of downtown Portland. The entire lot once was the grounds of the Henry Corbett mansion (built 1875), which remained until construction began on the Pacific Building. Corbett's widow kept a cow on the grounds at one time while a major city grew around it. This juxtapositioning of the old and new earned the lot a nickname: \\"The Million Dollar Cowpasture\\".

Jones (born 1955) is a seismologist and public voice for earthquake science and earthquake safety in California. One of the foremost and trusted public authorities on earthquakes, Jones is viewed by many in Southern California as the \\"seismologist-next-door,\\" who is frequently called up on to provide information on recent earthquakes. She is currently a research associate at the Seismological Laboratory at Caltech and chief scientist and founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society. She was previously at the US Geological Survey from 1985 to 2016, where she conducted research in the areas of foreshocks, seismotectonics, and the application of hazards science to improve societal resilience after natural disasters. At USGS, she was also part of the team of scientists that developed the Great Shakeout Earthquake Drills, during which millions around the world participate in annual earthquake safety drills. Scientific career Jones has authored over 100 papers on research seismology with primary interest in the physics of earthquakes, foreshocks and earthquake hazard assessment, and the seismotectonics (earthquake-producing geologic structures) of southern California. Jones received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chinese language and literature, magna cum laude, from Brown University in 1976 and a Ph.D. in geophysics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981. She visited China in February 1979 in order to study the 1975 Haicheng earthquake, which had apparently been successfully predicted by the Chinese authorities based on an analysis of its foreshock sequence. In doing so, she became one of the first United States scientists to enter China following the normalization of relations between the two countries.Wallace, 2011 She is a past Secretary of the Seismology Section of the American Geophysical Union, and past director and past chair of the publications committee of the Seismological Society of America. Jones served as the Science Advisor for Risk Reduction for the USGS Natural Hazards Mission Area, as part of the SAFRR Project. She also worked as a Commissioner of the California Seismic Safety Commission (CSSC), which advises the governor and legislature on seismic safety, by appointment of Governor Gray Davis in 2002 and reappointment by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2005 and served on the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council. In January 2014, she entered into a partnership on behalf of the USGS with the City of Los Angeles to serve as Seismic Risk Advisor to Mayor Eric Garcetti. After retiring from the USGS in 2016, Jones founded the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society and wrote a book published in 2018 titled The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters Have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them). In the book, Jones chronicles some of the world's greatest natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes, and analyzes how people have responded to them in order to understand how future crises can be survived. Jones is currently in residence at the University of Oregon's Wayne Morse Center for Law and Politics as the Wayne Morse Chair, where she provides public talks on disaster preparedness and science communication.  Public outreach  Since 1986, Jones has given many interviews to the press on behalf of the US Geological Survey following significant earthquakes in southern California. In many media appearances, she worked together with fellow Caltech seismologist, Kate Hutton. In a 2004 profile of Jones, Tom Jordan of the USGS was quoted as saying, \\"Lucy provides Southern California ‚Äî and the nation ‚Äî with a very calming voice and an authoritative voice to the public's inquiry in disaster.\\" He also said that her high public profile may make her \\"one of the most effective chairs of CSSC ever\\".Lubick, 2004 Public perception of Jones as a voice of calm and reassurance has been attributed, in part, to an incident following the 1992 Joshua Tree earthquake in which she answered press questions while holding her sleeping child in her arms. In a 2011 interview, Jones denied the story that she asked the press to be quiet so as not to wake her son. She also expressed some regret that she became a symbol that \\"women can have it all\\". In 2015, Jones was embedded at Los Angeles City Hall, a move by the USGS that Caltech's Tom Heaton credited with the September passage of a retrofitting plan that would increase seismic survivability of over 15,000 structures largely built of non-ductile concrete. In light of her reputation as a respected and trusted authority on earthquakes, Jones has been called upon for her comments regarding other natural disasters and crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Jones, in a crisis, the public is best served when they are given \\"one clear message\\" to minimize the possibility of overwhelming or confusing people. And for the COVID-19 pandemic, that message, says Jones, is \\"[d]on't share your air\\" by wearing a mask and maintaining physical distance.  Selected awards  Jones has received many awards from scientific and governmental organizations throughout her career, including the Alquist Award from the California Earthquake Safety Foundation, the Shoemaker Award for Lifetime Achievements in Science Communication from the USGS, the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal from the Partnership for Public Service in 2015, and the Seismological Society of America's Frank Press Public Service Award in 2018. Personal Jones, a fourth-generation resident of southern California, currently lives in Pasadena, California. She is married to fellow seismologist Egill Hauksson and they have two sons. Jones is a musician and composer, who plays a Renaissance stringed instrument called the viol. She is a member of Los Angeles Baroque, which calls itself \\"LA's Community Baroque Orchestra.\\" In 2019, Jones released a music video accompanying a piece she composed called In Nomine Terra Calens, which translates to ‚ÄúIn the Name of a Warming Earth.‚Äù In Nomine Terra Calens is her musical interpretation of global temperature data from 1880 to 2017, which shows an increase at what Jones calls a \\"terrifying\\" rate. In February 2019, Los Angeles Baroque performed In Nomine Terra Calens at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.

The Max Eyth House in Kirchheim unter Teck houses a permanent exhibit of Hans Bethge's books, photographs and other artifacts, while his manuscripts are preserved at the Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach. Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach  Life  Hans Bethge was born in 1876 in Dessau. He studied modern languages and philosophy at the universities of Halle, Erlangen and Geneva. After graduation, he spent two years as a teacher in Spain. In 1901, he set himself up as a freelance writer in Berlin. In 1943, at the height of the air campaign, he moved to the Swabian countryside where he spent his last years. Hans Bethge treasured friendships as well as all that was beautiful; many writers and artists were his friends, including the poet Prince Emil von Schoenaich-Carolath, the painters Willi Geiger and Karl Hofer, and the art historian Julius Meier- Gr√§fe, as well as other artists from the Worpswede artist colony. The Jugendstil painter Heinrich Vogeler illustrated three of his books, and the sculptor Wilhelm Lehmbruck, an early recognizer of his genius, made several portraits of him. He died in G√∂ppingen in 1946, aged 70; he was buried in Kirchheim unter Teck.  Artistic achievement  Bethge published several volumes of poems (chiefly on love and nature), diaries, travelogues, short stories, essays and plays. He had great success as an editor of modern poetry, German and foreign. But above all, his poetic translations of oriental classics (starting in 1907) gained him wide recognition, in spite of their reliance on previous translators. The first such book, \\"The Chinese Flute\\", had a printing of 100,000 copies. Gustav Mahler used six of its poems in Das Lied von der Erde. The fresh, musical rhythm of Bethge's language and his free versification inspired settings by more than 180 other composers, among them Richard Strauss, Karol Szymanowski, Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Hanns Eisler, Viktor Ullmann, Gottfried von Einem, Ernst Krenek, Artur Immisch, Ludvig Irgens-Jensen, Paul Graener, Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, Ernst Toch, Fartein Valen, Krzysztof Penderecki and Egon Wellesz.

The mission of the Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance Program is to detect and prevent the unlawful entry and distribution of prohibited and/or non-compliant products that may harbor exotic plant and animal pests, disease or invasive species. History In the mid 1990s, Asian fruit growers from the Homestead, Florida area complained to the PPQ Deputy Administrator about illegally imported specialty crops from Thailand flooding the New York markets. The agricultural products in New York eliminated the commodities‚Äô shipping costs from Florida and adversely affected many growers in the region. PPQ and APHIS Investigative and Enforcement Services (IES) formed a team that determined the prohibited items from Thailand were being smuggled through the Canada‚ÄìUS border in enormous quantities. These prohibited products were being offered for sale in the New York City market areas and were definitely competing with domestic and legal production. PPQ team members intercepted the prohibited material crossing the Canada‚ÄìUS border, and IES prosecuted the violators taking part in the shipping operation. In the first 2 years of the program, more than 68 tons of prohibited Asian fruit were seized and destroyed. The success of this operation led to the expansion of the program and development of specific position descriptions for PPQ liaison officers. A PPQ liaison officer is a PPQ officer who, in addition to their regular PPQ officer duties, works with IES investigators to identify and close the pathways of the unlawful entry and domestic distribution of prohibited foreign agricultural products into the United States. These positions were established nationwide in small numbers and organized into a network of officers whose main function was to detect and close smuggling pathways. With new positions and a growing challenge, PPQ established two additional satellite programs: Closing the Los Angeles Marketplace Pathway (CLAMP) and Florida Interdiction and Smuggling Team (FIST). State and Federal officials in the CLAMP program were tasked to detect smuggled fruit-fly host material and close the pathway of that harmful pest. FIST, on the other hand, had objectives much larger in scope. Both programs effectively sealed off pathways for potential exotic pest introductions into the United States. As the organization became more successful, it was recognized into a disparate regulatory force within PPQ and reorganized into the current Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance program. Work SITC plays a major role in interdicting smuggled agricultural products before and after they reach US markets. SITC's work is successfully accomplished through numerous market surveys, analysis of trends and the use of various intelligence tools and data systems. SITC officers and analysts are experts in developing commercial targeting information, examining trends in international trade, identifying contraband in commerce, and at the consumer level. SITC staff also works closely with Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the Ports of Entry to interdict smuggled products. In the marketplace, SITC officers conduct inspection surveys and intense trade compliance activities, looking to uncover prohibited or regulated items. This work may lead to trace backs to the Port of Entry in order to identify the distributor. Once a smuggling pathway is identified, it is shut down often resulting in civil and/or criminal prosecution, and recalls to safeguard American agriculture. The market place for SITC encompasses major distribution centers, flea markets, animal/plant and insect trade shows, large and small chain stores, roadside vendors and your neighborhood corner store. Lastly, the program has influenced changes in federal regulations in its efforts to regulate trade while promoting outreach and education to the public. The SITC staff works closely with other federal, state and local agencies in order to accomplish the program mission. SITC Officers work with the State Plant Health Directors to aid in the identification of Hot Zones. Through partnerships with other agencies, SITC has provided other Federal (CBP, OIG, IES, ICE, FSIS, FDA, etc.) and State officials (state agriculture agencies) with information leading to seizures, the stop sell of products, criminal prosecutions and administrative violations. While the SITC initiatives are often reactive, SITC takes many steps to be proactive which ultimately results in less cost to the American public for eradication programs. SITC Officers monitor increased threats with increased vigilance to monitor potential high risk smuggling pathways. The SITC staff works closely with liaison groups and industry to identify and address potential smugglers and various trade compliance issues. SITC Officers are flexible enough to be responsive to a wide breadth of agricultural threats, issues and challenges. Cooperation with other agencies SITC staff work with other federal, state and local agencies. Through partnerships with other agencies, SITC has provided other Federal and State officials with information leading to agriculture seizures, the stop sell of food products, criminal prosecutions and administrative violations. In the past, SITC has joined with: * Customs and Border Protection * USDA Office of Inspector General * USDA Investigative Enforcement Services * U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement * USDA Food Safety Inspection Service * Food and Drug Administration * US Fish and Wildlife Service SITC assists PPQ State Plant Health Directors and the Pest Survey Specialists with their targeted surveys for specific exotic pests and plant diseases. Additionally, the SITC staff works closely with liaison groups and the industry to identify and address potential smugglers and various trade compliance issues. Staff As of 2011, SITC employed a staff of 158 staff with 58 field offices located in major cities throughout the US. Additionally, the program has an intelligence unit that consists of eight SITC Operational Analysts, located in field and regional offices. They possess two SITC regional offices located in Fort Collins, Colorado and Raleigh, North Carolina; with a SITC National Coordinator located at the PPQ headquarters in Riverdale, Maryland.

It hosted the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team from 1900 to 1928, and held nearly 30,000 people at its peak. The stands were torn down after the 1928 season to make room for Notre Dame Stadium, which opened in 1930. Notre Dame played its entire 1929 schedule away from campus (\\"home\\" games were at Chicago's Soldier Field), went undefeated (9‚Äì0) and won the National Championship. At Coach Knute Rockne's insistence, Cartier Field's grass was transplanted into Notre Dame Stadium. An early sketch of Cartier Field, as seen in the October 14, 1899 edition of the Notre Dame Scholastic. For more than 30 years after the football team moved out, Cartier Field remained the home of Notre Dame's baseball and track and field teams. In 1962, the original Cartier Field was replaced by a quadrangle adjoining the Memorial Library, which opened in 1963, and a new facility named Cartier Field was opened east of Notre Dame Stadium. Since 2008, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team has held outdoor practices at the LaBar Football Practice Fields, and indoor practices at Meyo Field in the Loftus Center. It was named after Warren Antoine Cartier, an 1887 civil engineering graduate and former member of the football team who purchased 10 acres (40,000 m2) and donated it to the University for establishment of the Field. He also paid for furnishing the lumber required to enclose the Field with fencing and furnished the lumber required for a grandstand.http://magazine.nd.edu/news/47333-echoes-cartier- athletic-field/ The Fighting Irish would officially amass a 116‚Äì2‚Äì6 record at Cartier Field (with an additional three to five wins and one loss coming in the 1899 season before the stadium was completed, and an unrecognized win against Cincinnati in 1900) with their two losses coming against Wabash in 1905, and Carnegie Tech in 1928, which happened to be the last match football game played on the field. During this 29 year stretch, the Irish also recorded some of the longest home winning streaks in the history of college football, with 40 straight wins from 1907 to 1918, and 38 straight wins from 1919 to 1927 (if not for a tie against Great Lakes Navy in 1918, the streak would have been 78 straight contests). In terms of unbeaten streaks, the Irish went undefeated at home for 23 years, and 93 contests, from 1905 to 1928.

The character appeared in two serials during the Third Doctor era in the early 1970s, before making a surprise cameo towards the end of \\"Empress of Mars\\" in 2017. Character traits Alpha Centauri is a hermaphroditic hexapod from Alpha Centauri and, being effectively genderless is referred to as \\"it\\" as opposed to \\"he\\" or \\"she\\". It is tall, green, has one large blue eye, six arms and a high-pitched voice, wears a long yellow cape and walks with a nervous gait. It is prone to cowardice and hysterics. It has a low opinion of Earth, describing it as a \\"'remote and unattractive\\" planet, but regrets that its appearance can frighten humans. It regards females as unimportant. Alpha Centauri is also the name of Alpha Centauri's native star system. The Alpha Centauri binary star system is second only to Proxima Centauri in proximity to the Solar System, home to the Earth. Character history Alpha Centauri arrives on Peladon in The Curse of Peladon (1972) as a delegate overseeing Peladon's admission to the Galactic Federation. Half a century later, Alpha Centauri is on Peladon during the events of The Monster of Peladon (1974) now as Galactic Federation Ambassador to Peladon. Alpha Centauri makes a small cameo in Empress of Mars (2017) as an ambassador for the Galactic Federation welcoming the newly- awakened Ice Warriors to the universe, again voiced by Ysanne Churchman. Production Ysanne Churchman was instructed by director Lennie Mayne to make the creature sound like a \\"gay civil servant\\". The same costume was worn by Stuart Fell for both appearances as the character (albeit with two different cape designs). The character reappeared in The Monster of Peladon in order to help recreate the atmosphere of Peladon depicted in the earlier serial The Curse of Peladon. Other appearances Alpha Centauri appears in Legacy, a Virgin New Adventure spin-off novel set on Peladon, meeting the Seventh Doctor and Benny. Alpha Centauri and Benny appeal against the Doctor's death sentence for the murder of Lady Lianna, former handmaiden to Queen Thalira, to no avail, although the Doctor is later saved. Alpha Centauri also features in Fifth Doctor Big Finish audio drama The Bride of Peladon, this time voiced by Jane Goddard.

Reverend John Hall Magowan, D.D., L.L.D. (1829‚Äì1898) was pastor of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York City, from 1867 until his death in Bangor, Northern Ireland. The landmark New York church, that still stands today on Fifth Avenue at 55th Street, was built during his tenure. Education and training John Hall was born in Ballygorman, County Armagh, Ireland. His was the eldest son of William Hall and Rachel McGowan ‚Äì descendants of Scottish Presbyterians. His education began in a local school before he attended Belfast College in 1841. In 1845 he entered theological college under Dr. John Edgar and Dr Henry Cooke. In 1848 his father died; despite financial hardships his mother insisted he complete his religious studies and in 1850 he was ordained a Presbyterian missionary. During his time at college, Hall supplemented his income by teaching at a girls' school. Early missionary work From 1849 he spent three years as a student missionary in Connaught, a west coast province of Ireland that had been badly affected by both the Great Famine and the fever; small tenant farmers were being evicted by landlords and many of the young men were emigrating to escape the deprivation and poverty. The area was predominantly Catholic, and the local priests mistrusted the Presbyterian missionaries and questioned their motives. Hall's work included school inspections, preaching, distributing religious literature and establishing Sunday-schools. One scheme involved creating industrial schools where women could be taught new skills such as knitting and needlework. Much of the effort was non-denominational, with financial contributions from Methodists, Episcopalians, Quakers and Catholic teaching staff. During this period Hall started writing poems and articles for weekly newspapers, a practise that he continued for many years. Marriage Emily (Bolton) Irwin, wife of Rev. Dr John Hall As a missionary, Hall travelled over a wide area, working long hours, and his health suffered as a consequence. One of the ladies who established a school in the district was Mrs Emily (Bolton) Irwin (1816‚Äì1904), a widow with three children. Hall boarded with her relatives, and they nursed him back to health. A friendship developed between Emily Irwin and Hall and they eventually married in 1852. Armagh Hall's work as a missionary came to the notice of the congregation of the First Church in Armagh; they invited him to be their pastor, and he was installed in June 1852. The southern and western areas of County Armagh had suffered in the Great Famine, but the worst was over by the time Hall arrived. He travelled extensively, holding prayer meetings and sermons in remote locations, gradually increasing the size of his congregation. In 1855 he put his experience of journalism to good use, editing the Children's Missionary Herald of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. He continued this for five years, passing the responsibility for the publication to his colleague, Matthew Kerr, in 1860. He was also involved with the temperance movement, speaking and writing on the subject. All but one of his five children were born during his tenure at Armagh. (see Family) Mary's Abbey, Dublin In 1858 Hall became the associate pastor in Mary's Abbey, Dublin, joining Dr William B. Kirkpatrick. In 1861 he was appointed to the Commissioners of National Education (Ireland), a secular government committee. From about 1862 he edited a monthly magazine called the Evangelical Witness; this featured contributions from leading churchmen, and it became an influential publication. In 1862 wine merchant Alexander Findlater provided a site in Rutland Square (now Parnell Square) plus the funding for a new Presbyterian church in Dublin. One condition was that John Hall be appointed as the head of the project committee. The new Mary's Abbey was opened in 1864. In 1865 Hall became a Doctor of Divinity when he was awarded an honorary degree by the American University of Washington and Jefferson; in later years he received further degrees from Columbia University and Trinity College Dublin. During his time in Dublin, Hall was the chaplain at Mountjoy Female prison. He also devoted time to the various institutes for the orphans, the deaf and the blind. Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church America In 1867 Hall attended the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America with the Rev. Dr. James Denham of Derry. Hall spent about eight weeks in America, and during that time he gave talks and preached in several churches, including the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York, where a vacancy existed for a new pastor. He was offered the job and accepted, moving his family from Dublin to New York later that year. His initial salary was $6000 in gold and this was subsequently increased to $15,000. Building a new church By 1872 the Fifth Avenue church on the corner of 19th Street was no longer large enough to accommodate the growing congregation, and plans were made to build a new one further up-town. Newspaperman Robert E. Bonner identified a site on Fifth Avenue and Fifty-Fifth Street and made a large financial contribution towards the construction costs. The new church was opened in 1875. Hall's fears that the Church would be debt-burdened were not realised when other wealthy members made large contributions. Another fundraising scheme was the \\"sale\\" of the pews in the new church. Among the parishioners was the family of Theodore Roosevelt; Hall presided over the double funeral of Roosevelt's first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt, and his mother, Martha Bulloch Roosevelt, on February 17, 1884 at the church.\\"Wife And Mother Buried Together\\", New York Times, 17 Feb 1884, p. 3 Outside interests Despite his heavy workload, Hall was involved with several activities outside the Fifth Avenue Church, these included being the chancellor of the University of New York ‚Äì a post he held for ten years; he was a trustee for the Princeton Theological Seminary and the Wellesley College plus chairman of the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions and member of the Board of Church Erection. Hall was also a director of the Union Theological Seminary of New York. In 1891 a dispute arose between the seminary and The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church over the appointment of Charles Augustus Briggs, who was later accused of heresy. This caused a split between the two organisations, and because of this Hall resigned from the seminary. Shooting On November 29, 1891, a man fired three shots at Hall after he had left the church and was entering his parsonage next door. They missed their target, and the man, a 47-year-old German, John George Roth, was apprehended. He had formerly been in an asylum and became angry with Hall after he failed to get a reply to letters that he had sent him. Hall said that the man had occasionally attended church and that he had tried to help him. Hermann Warszawiak In 1892 a Polish Jew named Hermann Warszawiak arrived in New York from Scotland with letters of introduction to Hall. Warszawiak, who had initially trained to be a religious leader in the Jewish faith, had been christened by Scottish missionary Daniel Edwards in 1889. After theological studies in Edinburgh, he moved to New York and proposed to become a Presbyterian missionary to the Jews in the city. He joined the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church and received support for his work from the New York City Mission and Tract Society. After several successful years, he came into conflict with the leaders of the mission, who felt that he had become unmanageable. This escalated even further when he made a request to the Fifth Avenue Church to be ordained. A committee appointed to review his suitability rejected his application and questioned his integrity; a senior member of the church even employed a private detective to follow and report on his activities. Hall supported Warszawiak and considered he was being victimised, as did others in the church. Eventually Warszawiak was cleared of wrongdoing, but a damaging split had occurred within the church. Many of Hall's supporters from the early days had died or been replaced by this period. The board of trustees felt that it was time for a change and forced Hall into a position where he felt he had to resign. However, a backlash from within the church reversed the decisions; Hall was reinstated and six members of the board of trustees resigned instead. Final days In 1898 Hall began to struggle with his health and he was advised to visit England to seek some rest. He stayed at Buxton and, perhaps feeling the end was near, returned to Ireland to see his sisters. He managed to make it to Dublin and visited his old church in Rutland Square. He wanted to get to his old home in Ballygorman but was too weak and died in Bangor. His body was returned to New York and the funeral service held in the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church on October 4, 1898. Family Emily and John Hall had five children; they were: * Professor Robert William Hall (1854‚Äì1934), fellow executor of John Hall's will. * Bolton Hall (1854‚Äì1938), who founded the back-to-the-land movement. * Dr. Richard John Hall (1856‚Äì1897), surgeon. * Rev.

More than any other person, Orr was responsible for the invention of an effective method of using plaster casts and surgery to achieve a reduction in infection rates during treatment of open fractures and compound fractures before the widespread adoption of antibiotics. Biography Hiram Winnett Orr was born in West Newton, Pennsylvania, on March 17, 1877, and grew up in Nebraska. After attending the University of Nebraska from 1892 to 1895, he was accepted to the University of Michigan medical school during his junior year. He received his M.D. from Michigan in 1899, and returned to Nebraska to set up practice in Lincoln.Current Biography 1941, pp. In 1911, Orr became the superintendent of the Nebraska Orthopaedic Hospital. =Fracture care= When the United States entered World War I, Orr became a Major in the Medical Reserve Corps of the Allied Expeditionary Force.Id. at p Before going to France, Orr worked alongside Dr. Alexis Carrel at the Welsh Metropolitan War Hospital at Cardiff in Wales. Carrel had pioneered the treatment of wounds with the expectation that infection was inevitable without proper care, and had helped create an antiseptic called the Carrel-Dakin solution. While in France, Orr took the Carrel treatment further by cleaning wounds, packing them with petroleum soaked gauze (to prevent sticking), and then setting the fracture and immobilizing it with plaster- soaked bandages that would harden quickly. The results were visible within as little as three weeks, with no infection present after the primary cast was removed. Dr. Orr was credited by the British Medical Research Council as being one of three American physicians to pioneer the technique.\\"Dr. H.W. Orr, Orthopedic Pioneer, dies,\\" The Lincoln Star, October 12, 1956, pp 1-2. =Return to Nebraska= After leaving active service he returned to Nebraska. He helped organize and was commander of the 110th Medical Regiment of the Nebraska National Guard from June 23, 1922 to May 11, 1925. He later became chief surgeon at the Orthopedics Hospital, as well as of Bryan Memorial Hospital and Lincoln General Hospital. He was associated in private practice with Dr. Fritz Teal. Dr. Orr was a member of the Lancaster County Medical Association, the Nebraska Medical Association and the American Medical Association. He was for several years editor of the Journal of Orthopedic Surgery, and was a prolific writer and speaker, campaigning for his pioneering advances in treatment and for orthopedic surgery. Hiram Winnett Orr died in Rochester, Minnesota, on October 11, 1956. Legacy Although casts are now taken for granted, the proper healing of a broken bone could take weeks, or even months, prior to the 20th century. A severe break could lead to an infection which prolonged the healing process in the best of circumstances, and a bedridden patient encountered collateral problems. If a fracture healed improperly, the results were crippling. The loss of a limb, or even death, was a possible outcome for a broken bone prior to the invention of the modern cast. Brilliant in its application, yet ingeniously simple, the cast method required little expense (bandages, plaster and water), minimal time for the physician, and provided a faster and more effective cure for broken bones. By the time of Orr's death, the cast had become such a routine part of childhood that a broken leg meant that one's friends would \\"autograph\\" the dried plaster while the patient endured a relatively minor inconvenience.

Martin adapted his book for a 2005 film of the same title. Synopsis Its titular character is 28-year-old Mirabelle Buttersfield, a lonely, depressed Vermont transplant who sells expensive evening gloves nobody ever buys at Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills and spends her evenings watching television with her two cats. She moved to California in an attempt to find herself and fall in love but instead takes medication to fight off depression. Much to her chagrin, she is pursued by Jeremy, a socially inept and unambitious slacker and roadie for a band, and winds up entertaining his advances to avoid being alone. After a middle-aged, womanizing Seattle millionaire named Ray Porter visits her store and sends her a dinner invitation, the two begin to date. She attempts to forge a relationship with him, even though it's clear Porter isn't looking for a long- term commitment. Along the way, the story explores the deeper meaning behind their opposing intentions.Lanchester, John. The Counter Life.

Also playing roles in her life are her father, a dysfunctional Vietnam War veteran, and Lisa, her promiscuous, image-obsessed co-worker and voracious rival. Reception In his review in the New York Times, John Lanchester called it an \\"elegant, bleak, desolatingly sad first novella\\" and added, \\"The prose here is sometimes flat . . . the happy ending feels as if it has wandered in from somewhere else; and there is a touching confidence in the efficacy of self-help books. But there is nonetheless an impressive gravity about Shopgirl. Its glints of comedy are sharp and dry . . . The novella has an edge to it, and a deep, unassuageable loneliness. Steve Martin's most achieved work to date may well have the strange effect of making people glad not to be Steve Martin.\\" New York Times review Sienna Powers of January Magazine said \\"Shopgirl is the work of a mature, self-possessed writer . . . Martin infuses his story with a dark verve that is his own. The author's tone is at once blas√© and gentle and in the novella's 130 pages, he quietly presents us with a cast of characters that it's difficult not to care about.\\" January Magazine review In Entertainment Weekly, Margot Mifflin graded the book B with the comment, \\"Once you adjust to his newfound sincerity, Martin's shift from public follies to private frailties registers as courageous and convincing. If only he'd fleshed out his supporting cast, this would be Pure Gold.\\" Entertainment Weekly review The book entered the New York Times list of bestsellers at #6 on October 29, 2000.New York Times, October 29, 2000 It peaked at #4 and remained on the list for fifteen weeks.New York Times, February 11, 2001 References 2000 American novels American novellas American novels adapted into films Novels set in Beverly Hills, California Novels by Steve Martin Hyperion Books books ","title":"Shopgirl (novella)"},{"id":"12804058","text":"The 1 August 2007 Baghdad bombings occurred on 1 August 2007, when several suicide bombings and car bombings occurred in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.

Location The site now is only a clearing in the forest with little remaining except for some rotting foundations. It was accessible by bike or foot on the Galloping Goose Trail which follows a portion of the former Canadian National rail line between Victoria and the town of Youbou on the north shore of Cowichan Lake. The site of the Gold Commissioner's house is marked by a cairn on the north-western side of the Leech River at . The current stone cairn is a replica cairn erected by concerned businessmen after the original cairn was destroyed by vandals. The original cairn's bronze dedication plate has been stolen but it used to read: > Memorial erected by the B.C. Historical Association on site of gold > commissioner‚Äôs house to commemorate discovery of gold on Sooke River by > Lieut. P. Leech, July, 1864, and to mark the site of Leechtown, which sprang > up following discovery. Unveiled by the HON. R.BRUCE LIEUT.-GOVERNOR OF B.C. > SEPT. 15. 1928 History The town was named after Lieutenant Peter John Leech of the Royal Engineers and astronomer of the Vancouver Island Exploring Expedition who was later City Engineer for Victoria, British Columbia. The Expedition, led by Robert Brown, discovered gold on the Leech River in July 1864.. Within weeks, thousands of miners, many of whom were veterans of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush six years earlier, travelled from Victoria overland by trail or by steamer to Sooke. By August 14 of that year, 227 mining licences had been issued and by the end of the year there were 6 general stores and 3 hotels in business along with 30 saloons. At its peak, Leechtown and neighbouring Boulder City had 1,200 mines and 4,000 people, but by 1865, the area went into decline. As much as $100,000 in gold may have been taken out in the first year by a single miner, Donny Roux. Geology Leechtown is notable for its geologic placement, which is what gives rise to the historical gold finds. The Leech River runs along the Leech River Fault, a major regional fault that marks a distinct geological boundary between the Pacific Rim Terrane and the Crescent Terrane (part of Siletzia).Natural Resources Canada:Geoscape Victoria The \\"Leech River Complex\\" (also \\"Leech River Formation\\" and \\"Leech River Schist\\") is a well-known assemblage of highly deformed schists underlain by gneiss. The gold is thought to be derived from quartz stringers concentrated in the schists, emplaced by hydrothermal events related to the regional tectonic activity. Current status The area around Leechtown is still actively under placer claim, almost a century and a half after its discovery and still produces quantities of fine gold and flakes up to 0.25\\". In 2007 the area was purchased for the Greater Victoria water supply which will protect it from development and prevent public access. Although maps show Leechtown as being the end of the Galloping Goose Trail, since 2010 a warning sign and locked gate have greeted hikers before the end of the trail. Thus Leechtown is no longer accessible from the Galloping Goose Trail. Folklore Local legends report that a tunnel exists in Leechtown that has been chiseled out of the rock, with multiple galleries. The Colonist newspaper planned to fund an expedition in search of the lost tunnel in 1959, but the only person with knowledge of its location, Ed Mullard, died before the search could take place. The Mullard Tunnel is located in Jordan Meadows, approximately away and there have been several stories of the discovery of the tunnel. Mullard was in the Jordan Meadows area prospecting and went deer hunting one afternoon and stumbled upon the tunnel entrance. A logger supposedly discovered the tunnel in 1928 and ended up in Las Vegas with some of the gold. There was supposedly a gold bar from the tunnel on display at the Mineral Titles office in Victoria, BC until the early 1980s but no one knows the location of the gold bar now.

The facility offers walking trails, formal gardens, arboretum, the Azalea Overlook, waterfalls, and a visitor center. Originally, privately developed during the 1940s and opened to the public in 1956. The park was formally dedicated on May 1, 1959 and transferred to a non-profit foundation in 1960. In April 2007, it became part of the Louisiana public parks system. It is the largest horticultural park and recreation area in the United States and with the acquisition Hodges Garden became the newest park in Louisiana. As of February 20, 2018 ownership of Hodge's Garden State Park was transferred to the A. J. and Nona Trigg Hodges Foundation and closed. The park remains closed with no plans of reopening.Friends of Hodges Gardens State Park web site. Retrieved June 29, 2018. History The area was once home to bands of Native Americans, Spanish and French Explorers, and Highwaymen that were prominent during the time of the Neutral Strip (Louisiana). A road known as the El Camino Real, or the King's Highway, passed through what became Hodges Garden, and across the Sabine River at Gain's Ferry. It originated in Natchitoches, crossed west central Louisiana, through Texas to Mexico City. Andrew Jackson Hodges, Sr. (1890-1966), a native of Cotton Valley in Webster Parish, purchased more than of cut-over barren land and replanted in timber. The land included an old quarry. Hodges and his wife, the former Nona Trigg, planned a scenic garden around the natural rock formations. The quarry had been used to supply rocks, stones, and sandstone to build, among other things, the jetties in Port Arthur. Work began on the jetties in 1898; material from the quarry was delivered by wagon that would have been at least a six-day round trip. Water from a lake created in 1954 is pumped through the gardens to waterfalls, pools, a geyser, fountains, and to the watering system before it is recycled back into the lake. Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu, head of the Culture, Recreation, and Tourism Department, said that the state signed a transfer agreement with the Hodges Foundation. Landrieu, who left the lieutenant governorship in May 2010 to become mayor of New Orleans, noted that A. J. Hodges \\"took a barren stone quarry and turned it into a thriving tourist area. The state‚Äôs takeover of the park will restore the garden‚Äôs original beauty, upgrade accommodations, and ultimately add value to this economic asset.\\" In 2015, the gardens were listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Camping facilities became available a few months thereafter. But after nine years, the state, with a tight budget, chose not to continue to operate Hodges Gardens.

It is 2.1 miles (3.39 km) in length. The creek formerly traveled further inland, to what is now Pelham Parkway, extending almost to Eastchester Bay and making Throggs Neck into an island during heavy storms. However, much of the route has been filled in, replaced by such structures as the New York City Subway's Westchester Yard and the Hutchinson Metro Center. Westchester Creek's present- day head is at Herbert H. Lehman High School; the remaining portion is largely inaccessible and surrounded by industrial enterprises or empty lots. Westchester Creek is traversed by the Bruckner Interchange at about its midpoint. Pugsley Creek, historically known as Maenippis Kill and Cromwell's Creek, is a right bank tributary of Westchester Creek and is surrounded by a park of the same name. The creek formerly extended north to Westchester Avenue, but was later truncated to Bruckner Expressway and then to its current terminus at Lacombe Avenue. Most of the former creekbed has been developed, though a single block of Bolton Avenue on the creek's path remains undeveloped. Ferry Point Park is on the east bank. The first permanent European settlement in the Bronx, Westchester Square, was established in 1654 by Thomas Pell and 15-20 settlers at the head of navigation of Westchester Creek.Bronx County Historical Society - Bronx Chronology The creek's original headwaters was buried in the 1930s to make way for the construction of the Hutchinson River Parkway. A 30-slip marina called Metro Marine was built on the creek in 1957. The creek has become polluted over the years due to heavy industrial use.

He was still of a young age and according to the chronicler Smbat Sparapet 'he did not display the same obedience to everyone as previously when he was under a tutor, rather he ruled the patriarchy in a willful manner, as his mother's brother wished'. This caused envy amongst the more senior clergymen and brought many charges against him implying that he was not capable of being Catholicos. They brought these claims to Prince Levon I of Armenia many times until he relented and had Gregory imprisoned in his palace at Hromgla. Word spread of his imprisonment and people attempted to free him to no avail. Catholicos Gregory was moved to the fortress of Kopitar and brought before Prince Levon. The agitated residents of Hromkla secretly sent Gregory word to prepare to escape and convinced the lord of the fortress to free him, but the Catholicos misinterpreted this message and attempted to free himself.

At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal he was a member of the eight along with Tony Hurt, Ivan Sutherland, Trevor Coker, Peter Dignan, Lindsay Wilson, Joe Earl and Alec McLean and Simon Dickie (cox). The 1977 World Rowing Championships saw Rodger secure second spot in the coxless four with Ivan Sutherland, David Lindstrom and Des Lock under new coach Harry Mahon. 1978 saw another third in the men's eight at his home course of Lake Karapiro, New Zealand. 1979 was a compulsory rest and marriage to Dianne (n√©e Zorn), a leading New Zealand athlete. Rodger was selected for the coxed four to compete at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow but did not go due to the Olympics boycott. 1981 saw Rodger gain a seat back in the elite men's eight as stroke but also saw Rodger for the first time relinquish a top three spot as he'd scored in previous world championships. However, the next year with Rodger in the six seat saw the NZ eight catapult from seventh in 1981 to world champions in 1982 and 1983. At the 1982 World Rowing Championships at Rotsee, Switzerland, he was the stroke. At the 1983 World Rowing Championships at Wedau in Duisburg, Germany, he was in seat three. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles he was a member of the eight which finished fourth. His wife competed in the women's 3000 metres, and that year they were the first husband and wife to compete for New Zealand at the same Olympic Games. After the disappointment of a fourth place at the Olympic Games, Rodger continued a further year in the eight in 1985 only to come fourth again, this time in the two seat. Some believe that if Rodger had been in the six seat in both the Olympic eight and the 1985 eight the crew results could have been more golden but of that is now speculation or part of the rowing story time. The resulting fourth and continued placement in the two seat saw Rodger retire from rowing and join the 1987 America's Cup in Fremantle, Western Australia. Rodger enjoyed being part of a group of people who built and sailed the first fibreglass 12 metre yacht (KZ3) in the 12 metre world championships finishing fifth as a grinder and the first of five rowers to join the America's cup and Team New Zealand at a later stage. Rodger now coaches, encouraging deep burn and sixty-minute ergs, as well as eating yoghurt and drinking milk straight after training. He has been quoted as saying \\"if you were like me you would be viewing milk as a food and not as a liquid\\" and \\"you'll see that I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing\\" and \\"a joke's a joke, a poke's a poke......no poke, no joke.\\" He is well respected for making awkward jokes about his New Zealand accent, relying heavily on the correlation between 'six' and 'sex'. His son Logan is now attempting to follow in his father's footsteps as a budding young rower and member of the Waikato Regional Performance Rowing Centre. In 1982, the 1982 rowing eight crew was named sportsman of the year. The 1982 team was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1995.

Morris. The albums followed a standard format. Side 1 of the LP would always be devoted to brief summaries of historical events, interspersed with dramatic readings by actors Fredric March and Florence Eldridge of historical documents and literary works relevant to whatever was being discussed. The summaries would be read by CBS journalist Charles Collingwood. As the albums progressed toward more modern times, actual recordings of the voices of such politicians as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Joseph McCarthy, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon were used. The dramatic readings (not the recordings of the politicians) would often be accompanied by music by such composers as Virgil Thomson. Side 2 of the LP would always be devoted to songs and music from the era being covered. These ranged from Quaker hymns and 18th-century dance music to Broadway show tunes. The albums were quite distinguished in their day, but today would be regarded as extremely politically incorrect. (One such example was a wildly melodramatic reading by Ms. Eldridge of Tom's death scene from the book Uncle Tom's Cabin, which, back then, had still not quite acquired the rather infamous reputation it has now.) Native Americans were invariably referred to as Indians on the recordings, and African-Americans were called Negroes, as was customary then. This is most likely the main reason that the set, which broke off with the inauguration of John F. Kennedy (but did mention his assassination), has never been issued on CD. The albums as well as the books were obtainable only through mail order, and were shipped on the average of one every two months. Thus, it would take an average buyer two full years to acquire the complete set.

Born Simon Parry in Anglesey, Wales, he moved to London in the late 1990s. Parry had grown interested in antifolk after hearing Beck's Stereopathic Soulmanure album (1994). However, it was only after a trip to New York's Sidewalk Cafe (where Beck had first come to prominence) in 2001 that he thought a similar movement should be created in London. Similar to Lach, the New York-based musician/promoter who first started booking 'antifolk' shows at various venues in New York City after finding himself unwelcome at more traditional venues, Parry founded a similar movement in London in 2002, taking the stagename Filthy Pedro. He created the antifolk.co.uk website and soon after started a seasonal gig in London -- 'The Antifolk UK Fest' -- where unusual and like- minded songwriters could perform outside of the generic indie/rock scene. The 'antifolk movement' and its unorthodox practices (often booking people on its shows with a low level of musical competence), started to attract some press attention in 2006, with Filthy Pedro a key interviewee. The movement has been championed by Nude Magazine, Time Out London and Everett True of Plan B Magazine and The Village Voice. Filthy Pedro has appeared on Channel 4's Transmission programme (which borrowed the idea from his song 'Rock N Roll Points' as an interview technique), was recommended by Lauren Laverne in the NME and in 2007 performed live on Marc Riley's BBC6 radio show following the launch of his first single.

She was responsible for delivering necessary goods and equipment to ships and stations in the war zone.  Renamed Gold Star  Gold Star (AK-12) was built in 1920 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., Wilmington, Delaware: taken over by the Navy as Arcturus from the USSB 8 November [1921]; commissioned as Arcturus (AK-12) on 1 February 1922 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lieutenant Commander. J. Katterfield, USNRF, in command and five days later renamed Gold Star (AK-12) on 6 February. The ship was reclassified AG-12, 12 May 1922.  Post-World War I operations  Renamed Gold Star sailed from Philadelphia 18 March 1922, arriving Seattle, Washington, 1 July via the Panama Canal Zone and California ports. During the next two years she served as a cargo ship on the United States West Coast, making three voyages with supplies for radio stations in the Territory of Alaska. The ship steamed out of San Francisco, California, 9 October 1924 to assume her duties as station ship at Guam, arriving 3 November 1924.  An Asia specialist  During the 1920s and 1930s Gold Star became a familiar sight in the far-flung ports of Asia. Though assigned as flagship of the US Navy at Guam she made frequent voyages to Japan, China, and the Philippines with cargo and passengers. Prior to World War II, much of her crew was made up of Chamorro, natives of Guam with American non-commissioned officers and commissioned officers. pp. 68-69. Gold Star became a spy ship by taking on a communications intelligence mission as she moved from port to port in the Orient. As a station ship she was assigned to monitor 1) Internal Japanese Fleet frequencies 2) Frequencies measurements and DF or direction finder azimuths. She had three intercept operators and one chief radioman supervised by an officer. This all started in 1933 during the reconstruction of the Japanese fleet by Tokyo and continued into the summer of 1941. Gold Star along with ground stations at Guam, Olongapo and Beijing provided significant intelligence before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.

She thus contributed importantly to strengthening Australia and to checking the Japanese advance in New Guinea. After 15 August 1943 the ship continued her coastal operations in Australia, but also began a series of cargo voyages to New Guinea and the Admiralty Islands. Gold Star brought many loads of vital supplies to Milne Bay as the Allies began the push toward the Philippines.  Supporting American invasion forces  The ship arrived Manus Island on 6 January 1945 for repairs and conversion to squadron flagship for Service Squadron 9. Operating in this capacity the vessel supported the mounting American advance toward Japan, sailing to Leyte and Morotai. While conducting cargo operations at Morotai on 28 June Gold Star was attacked by enemy aircraft but sustained no damage. She arrived Manila 26 July via Tawitawi and remained there issuing supplies until the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945.  End-of-war activity  After supporting occupation forces in Japan, Gold Star sailed to Seattle, Washington, in February 1946 and decommissioned there on 17 April 1946. She had served over 21 years in the Western Pacific Ocean without once returning to the United States, and had carried countless tons of supplies, items large and small, for the warships of the fleet.

Doxorubicin (DXR) is a 14-hydroxylated version of daunorubicin, the immediate precursor of DXR in its biosynthetic pathway. Daunorubicin is more abundantly found as a natural product because it is produced by a number of different wild type strains of streptomyces. In contrast, only one known non-wild type species, streptomyces peucetius subspecies cesius ATCC 27952, was initially found to be capable of producing the more widely used doxorubicin. This strain was created by Arcamone et al. in 1969 by mutating a strain producing daunorubicin, but not DXR, at least in detectable quantities. Subsequently, Hutchinson's group showed that under special environmental conditions, or by the introduction of genetic modifications, other strains of streptomyces can produce doxorubicin. His group has also cloned many of the genes required for DXR production, although not all of them have been fully characterized. In 1996, Strohl's group discovered, isolated and characterized dox A, the gene encoding the enzyme that converts daunorubicin into DXR. By 1999, they produced recombinant Dox A, a Cytochrome P450 oxidase, and found that it catalyzes multiple steps in DXR biosynthesis, including steps leading to daunorubicin. This was significant because it became clear that all daunorubicin producing strains have the necessary genes to produce DXR, the much more therapeutically important of the two. Hutchinson's group went on to develop methods to improve the yield of DXR, from the fermentation process used in its commercial production, not only by introducing Dox A encoding plasmids, but also by introducing mutations to deactivate enzymes that shunt DXR precursors to less useful products, for example baumycin-like glycosides. Some triple mutants, that also over- expressed Dox A, were able to double the yield of DXR. This is of more than academic interest because at that time DXR cost about $1.37 million per kg and current production in 1999 was 225 kg per annum. More efficient production techniques have brought the price down to $1.1 million per kg for the non- liposomal formulation. Although DXR can be produced semi-synthetically from daunorubicin, the process involves electrophilic bromination and multiple steps and the yield is poor. Since daunorubicin is produced by fermentation, it would be ideal if the bacteria could complete DXR synthesis more effectively. Overview The anthracycline skeleton of doxorubicin (DXR) is produced by a Type II polyketide synthase (PKS) in streptomyces peucetius. First, a 21-carbon decaketide chain (Fig 1. (1)) is synthesized from a single 3-carbon propionyl group from propionyl-CoA, and 9 2-carbon units derived from 9 sequential (iterative) decarboxylative condensations of malonyl-CoA. Each malonyl-CoA unit contributes a 2-carbon ketide unit to the growing polyketide chain. Each addition is catalyzed by the \\"minimal PKS\\" consisting of an acyl carrier protein (ACP), a ketosynthase (KS)/chain length factor (CLF) heterodimer and a malonyl-Coa:ACP acyltransferase(MAT). (refer to top of Figure 10. This process is very similar to fatty acid synthesis, by fatty acid synthases and to Type I polyketide synthesis. But, in contrast to fatty acid synthesis, the keto groups of the growing polyketide chain are not modified during chain elongation and they are not usually fully reduced. In contrast to Type I PKS systems, the synthetic enzymes (KS, CLF, ACP and AT) are not attached covalently to each other, and may not even remain associated during each step of the polyketide chain synthesis. After the 21-carbon decaketide chain of DXR is completed, successive modifications are made to eventually produce a tetracyclic anthracycline aglycone (without glycoside attached). The daunosamine amino sugar, activated by addition of Thiamine diphosphateTDP, is created in another series of reactions. It is joined to the anthracycline aglycone and further modifications are done to produce first daunorubicin then DXR. There are at least 3 gene clusters important to DXR biosynthesis: dps genes which specify the enzymes required for the linear polyketide chain synthesis and its first cyclizations, the dnr cluster is responsible for the remaining modifications of the anthracycline structure and the dnm genes involved in the amino sugar, daunosamine, synthesis. Additionally, there is a set of \\"self resistance\\" genes to reduce the toxic impact of the anthracycline on the producing organism. One mechanism is a membrane pump that causes efflux of the DXR out of the cell (drr loci). Since these complex molecules are only advantageous under specific conditions, and require a lot of energy to produce, their synthesis is tightly regulated. Polyketide Chain Synthesis Doxorubicin is synthesized by a specialized polyketide synthase. The initial event in DXR synthesis is the selection of the propionyl-CoA starter unit and its decarboxylative addition to a two carbon ketide unit, derived from malonyl-CoA to produce the five carbon B-ketovaleryl ACP. The five carbon diketide is delivered by the ACP to the cysteine sulfhydryl group at the KS active site, by thioester exchange, and the ACP is released from the chain. The free ACP picks up another malonate group from malonyl-CoA, also by thioester exchange, with release of the CoA. left The ACP brings the new malonate to the active site of the KS where is it decarboxylated, possibly with the help of the CLF subunit, and joined to produce a 7 carbon triketide, now anchored to the ACP (see top of Figure 1). Again the ACP hands the chain off to the KS subunit and the process is repeated iteratively until the decaketide is completed. In most Type II systems the initiating event is delivery by ACP of an acetate unit, derived from acetyl-CoA, to the active site of the ketosynthase (KS) subunit of the KS/CLF heterodimer. The default mode for Type II PKS systems is the incorporation of acetate as the primer unit, and that holds true for the DXR \\"minimal PKS\\". In other words, the action of KS/CLF/ACP (Dps A, B and G) from this system will not produce 21-carbon decaketides, but 20-carbon decaketides instead, because acetate is the ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù starter. The process of specifying propionate is not completely understood, but it is clear that it depends on an additional protein, Dps C, which may be acting as a ketosynthase or acyltransferase selective for propionyl-CoA, and possibly Dps D makes a contribution. A dedicated MAT has been found to be dispensable for polyketide production under in vitro conditions. The PKS may \\"borrow\\" the MAT from its own fatty acid synthase and this may be the primary way ACP receives its malonate group in DXR biosynthesis. Additionally, there is excellent evidence that \\"self- malonylation\\" is an inherent characteristic of Type II ACPs. In summary, a given Type II PKS may provide its own MAT (s), it may borrow one from FAS, or its ACP may ‚Äúself-malonylate‚Äù. It is unknown whether the same KS/CLF/ACP ternary complex chaperones the growth of a full length polyketide chain through the entire catalytic cycle, or whether the ACP dissociates after each condensation reaction. A 2.0-√Ö resolution structure of the actinorhodin KS/CLF, which is very similar to the dps KS/CLF, shows polyketides being elongated inside an amphipathic tunnel formed at the interface of the KS and CLF subunits. The tunnel is about 17-√Ö long and one side has many charged amino acid residues which appear to be stabilizing the carbonyl groups of the chain, while the other side is hydrophobic. This structure explains why both subunits are necessary for chain elongation and how the reactive growing chain is protected from random spontaneous reactions until it is positioned properly for orderly cyclization. The structure also suggests a mechanism for chain length regulation. Amino acid side groups extend into the tunnel and act as \\"gates\\". A couple of particularly bulky residues may be impassable by the chain, causing termination. Modifications to tunnel residues based on this structure were able to alter the chain length of the final product. The final condensation causes the polyketide chain to \\"buckle\\" allowing an intramolecular attack by the C-12 methylene carbanion, generated by enzyme catalyzed proton removal and stabilized by electrostatic interactions in the tunnel, on the C-7 carbonyl (see 3 in Figure 1). This tunnel aided intramolecular aldol condensation provides the first cyclization when the chain is still in the tunnel. The same C-7/C-12 attack occurs in the biosynthesis of DXR, in a similar fashion. Conversion to 12-deoxyalkalonic acid The 21-carbon decaketide is converted to 12-deoxyalkalonic acid (5), the first free easily isolated intermediate in DXR biosynthesis, in 3 steps. These steps are catalyzed by the final 3 enzymes in the dps gene cluster and are considered part of the polyketide synthase. While the decaketide is still associated with the KS/CLF heterodimer the 9-carbonyl group is reduced by Dps E, the 9-ketoreductase, using NADPH as the reducing agent/hydride donor. Dps F, the ‚Äú1st ring cyclase‚Äù /aromatase, is very specific and is in the family of C-7/C-12 cyclases that require prior C-9 keto-reduction. These two reactions are felt to occur while the polyketide chain is still partially in the KS/CLF tunnel and it is not known what finally cleaves the chain from its covalent link to the KS or ACP. If the Dps F cyclase is inactivated by mutations or gene deletions, the chain will cyclize spontaneously in random fashion. Thus, Dps F is thought to ‚Äúchaperone‚Äù or help fold the polyketide to ensure non- random cyclization, a reaction that is energetically favorable and leads to subsequent dehydration and resultant aromatization. Next, Dps Y regioselectively promotes formation of the next two carbon-carbon bonds and then catalyzes dehydration leading to aromatization of one of the rings to give (5). Conversion to Œµ-rhodomycinone The next reactions are catalyzed by enzymes originating from the dnr gene cluster. Dnr G, a C-12 oxygenase (see (5) for numbering) introduces a keto group using molecular oxygen. It is an \\"anthrone type oxygenase\\", also called a quinone-forming monooxygenase, many of which are important 'tailoring enzymes' in the biosynthesis of several types of aromatic polyketide antibiotics. They have no cofactors: no flavins, metals or energy sources. Their mechanism is poorly understood but may involve a \\"protein radical\\". Alkalonic acid (6), a quinone, is the product. Dnr C, alkalonic acid-O-methyltransferase methylates the carboxylic acid end of the molecule forming an ester, using S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the cofactor/methyl group donor. The product is alkalonic acid methyl ester (7). The methyl group is removed later, but it serves to activate the adjacent methylene bridge facilitating its attack on the terminal carbonyl group, a reaction catalyzed by DnrD. Dnr D, the fourth ring cyclase (AAME cyclase), catalyzes an intramolecular aldol addition reaction. No cofactors are required and neither aromatization nor dehydration occurs. A simple base catalyzed mechanism is proposed. The product is aklaviketone (8). Dnr H, aklaviketone reductase, stereospecifically reduces the 17-keto group of the new fourth ring to a 17-OH group to give aklavinone (9). This introduces a new chiral center and NADPH is a cofactor. Dnr F, aklavinone-11-hydroxylase, is a FAD monooxygenase that uses NADPH to activate molecular oxygen for subsequent hydroxylation. Œµ-rhodomycinone (10) is the product. Conversion to doxorubicin Dnr S, daunosamine glycosyltransferase catalyzes the addition of the TDP activated glycoside, L-daunosamine-TDP to Œµ-rhodomycinone to give rhodomycin D (Figure 2). The release of TDP drives the reaction forward. The enzyme has sequence similarity to glycosyltransferases of the other \\"unusual sugars\\" added to Type II PKS aromatic products. left Dnr P, rhodomycin D methylesterase, removes the methyl group added previously by DnrC. It initially served to activate the adjacent methylene bridge, and after that it prevented its carboxyl group from leaving the C-10 carbon (see Fig 2). Had the carboxyl group not been esterified prior to the fourth ring cyclization, its departure as [ CO2 would have been favored by the formation of a bicyclic aromatic system. After C-7 reduction and glycosylation, the C-8 methylene bridge is no longer activated for deprotonation, thereby making aromatization less likely. Note that the non-isolable intermediate, with numbering, is the 3rd molecule in Figure 2. The numbering system is very odd and a vestige of early nomenclature. The decarboxylation of the intermediate occurs spontaneously, or by the influence of Dnr P, giving 13-deoxycarminomycin. A crystal structure, with bound products, of aclacinomycin methylesterase, an [enzyme] with 53% sequence homology to Dnr P, from streptomyces purpurascens, has been solved. It is able to catalyze the same reaction and uses a classic Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad with serine acting as the nucleophile and gly-met providing stabilization of the transition state by forming an \\"oxyanion hole\\". The active site amino acids are almost entirely the same as Dnr P, and the mechanism is almost certainly identical. Although Dox A is shown next in the biosynthetic scheme (Figure 2), Dnr K, carminomycin 4-O-methyltransferase is able to O-methylate the 4-hydroxyl group of any of the glycosides in Figure 2. A 2.35 √Ö resolution crystal structure of the enzyme with bound products has recently been solved. The orientation of the products is consistent with a SN2 mechanism of methyl transfer. Site-directed mutagenesis of the potential acid/base residues in the active site did not affect catalysis leading to the conclusion that Dnr K most likely acts as an entropic enzyme in that rate enhancement is mainly due to orientational and proximity effects. This is in contrast to most other O-methyltransferases where acid/base catalysis has been demonstrated to be an essential contribution to rate enhancement. Dox A catalyzes three successive oxidations in streptomyces peucetius. Deficient DXR production is not primarily due to low levels of or malfunctioning Dox A, but because there are many products diverted away from the pathway shown in Figure 2. Each of the glycosides is a potential target of shunt enzymes, not shown, some of which are products of the dnr gene cluster. Mutations of these enzymes does significantly boost DXR production. In addition, Dox A has a very low kcat/Km value for C-14 oxidation (130/M) compared to C-13 oxidation (up to 22,000/M for some substrates). Genetic manipulation to overexpress Dox A has also increased yields, particularly if the genes for the shunt enzymes are inactivated simultaneously. Dox A is a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase that has broad substrate specificity, catalyzing anthracycline hydroxylation at C-13 and C-14 ( Figure 2). The enzyme has an absolute requirement for molecular oxygen and NADPH. Initially, two successive oxidations are done at C-13, followed by a single oxidation of C-14 that converts daunorubicin to doxorubicin.

During World War 1 he was the Chief of Intelligence at the British Expeditionary Force General Headquarters from 1915 to 1918. In later life he was a Unionist Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Dumfriesshire. Early life Charteris was born on 8 January 1877, probably in Glasgow, son of Matthew Charteris (1840‚Äì97), Regius Professor of Materia Medica at the University of Glasgow. He was from a distinguished academic family. His uncle was Archibald Hamilton Charteris (1835-1908), Professor of Liberal Criticism at the University of Edinburgh and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (1892). His older brother, also called Archibald Hamilton Charteris (1874-1940), was Professor of International Law at the University of Sydney, whilst another brother, Francis James Charteris, was Professor of Materia Medica at the University of St Andrews.Matthew 2004, pp213-4 He received his early formal education at Kelvinside Academy from 1886‚Äì91, then spent a year studying Mathematics & Physics at G√∂ttingen University in Germany. He was fluent in the French and German languages.Reid 2006, pp156-9 Early military career He entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in December 1893, and on graduating received a commission into the Royal Engineers in March 1896, and was sent to Asia, where he joined the British Imperial Indian Army. He entered Staff College, Quetta in 1907, and was the outstanding graduate of his year in 1909. Major-General Douglas Haig, then Chief of Staff India, became his patron. Charteris was a staff captain at India HQ 1909‚Äì10, then 1910-12 was GSO2 on the Operations Section of the Indian General Staff. When Haig was appointed to Corps Command at Aldershot in 1912, as Assistant Military Secretary Captain Charteris was one of the trusted officers who found a place in his retinue.Reid 2006, pp156-9 World War I In August 1914 on the outbreak of World War 1, whilst still at the junior officer rank of captain, Charteris was appointed an Aide-de-Camp to Haig, whom he accompanied to France with the British Expeditionary Force (B.E.F.). In September 1914 Haig issued him with an order to establish an Intelligence Office in I Corps Headquarters, Haig's Command, with the aim of providing operational information on the activities of the Imperial German Army. Despite being fluent in French and German Charteris had no background or formal training in intelligence work. He remained in Haig's retinue engaged in this work when I Corps was enlarged and converted into the B.E.F.'s First Army in December 1914, and then on to the B.E.F.'s General Headquarters, when Haig was appointed Commander-in-Chief in December 1915, where Charteris was promoted by Haig to the rank of brigadier-general in 1915 at 38 years of age. Haig also awarded him the Distinguished Service Order for his work on his H.Q. Staff in 1915. Charteris was brash, untidy, and liked to start the day with a brandy and soda. He was a sort of licensed jester (known as \\"The Principal Boy\\" due to his rapid promotion) amidst Haig's staid inner circle. In Walter Reid's view he comes across as likeable and able in his own writings, including his letters to his much younger wife Noel (the \\"Douglas\\" frequently referred to in his letters is their infant son). Haig's chaplain George S. Duncan later commented on how Charteris' \\"vitality and loud-mouthed exuberance\\" made him unpopular. Lord Derby, then Secretary of State for War, began to have doubts about Charteris in the role as the B.E.F.'s Intelligence Chief after an incident in February 1917 when he failed to censor an interview given by Haig to French journalists. Charteris was sometimes described as Haig's \\"evil counsellor\\", and has been blamed by some historians for Haig's errors, with the accusation that he had a propensity in intelligence briefings to provide assessments of the German situation that gave Haig what he wanted to hear. He produced reports of poor German morale based on interviews with prisoners, and of German manpower shortages based on statistical analysis of their paybooks, which gave a German soldier's age and year of callup. These reports were influential in Haig's decisions affecting the conduct of military campaigns, and were increasingly criticised by Major-General Macdonogh, intelligence advisor at the War Office.John Charteris at First World War.com Haig kept him on after his inadequacies had been exposed. However, the historian John Bourne has stated that Charteris was methodical and hardworking. Herbert Lawrence, who became the B.E.F.'s Chief of Intelligence briefly in early 1918, testified to the efficiency of the organisation he inherited from Charteris when he replaced him after his dismissal. Bourne argues that although Charteris was wrong about the wider issues of German morale and manpower, he was effective at predicting enemy troop deployments, immediate plans and tactical changes. In Bourne's view, he was not Haig's \\"evil genius\\", but rather shared Haig's innate optimism and did nothing to undermine it. An official inquiry blamed intelligence failures by Charteris' Department for the near debacle at the Battle of Cambrai, where a German counter-attack had retaken almost all the British gains. By the end of 1917 Charteris was known as \\"the U-Boat\\". In January 1918 Brigadier-General Edgar William Cox was recalled to France to replace Charteris. Charteris' final intelligence reports correctly predicted a German offensive in Spring 1918. Charteris was moved to the job of Deputy Director of Transportation at GHQ. Propaganda Charteris was also been associated with some notable allied propaganda and disinformation successes, such as \\"the master hoax\\" of World War 1, being the story of the existence of a German corpse factory Kadaververwertungsanstalt, in which the Germans supposedly rendered their own dead soldiers into fats. This story was circulated in several British and international newspapers in 1917. After the war Charteris allegedly claimed in a public speech that he invented it when he deliberately switched captions on two German war pictures: one image showed soldiers killed in battle being taken away for burial, while the other showed horse carcasses being delivered to a processing factory behind German lines. One of his subordinates created a fake diary describing the use of the factory. This was to have been planted on the corpse of German soldier, to be \\"found\\" as proof of the story, but this plan was eventually dropped. Charteris's comments caused a media outcry.\\"Candid Charteris\\" in Time 1925 Phillip Knightley says that all the evidence suggests that the story originated in newspaper reports about a real factory for rendering animal corpses. Charteris may have concocted the claim that he invented it in order to impress his audience, not realizing a reporter was present.Knightley, Phillip (2000). The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth- Maker from the Crimea to Kosovo. Prion. 105 Randal Marlin has written that Charteris's claim to have invented the story is \\"demonstrably false\\" in a number of details. However, it is possible that a fake diary was created but never used. Nevertheless, this fake diary, which Charteris claimed still existed when he made the comments has never been found. In fact Charteris's comments later gave Adolf Hitler rhetorical ammunition to portray the British as liars. Post-war military career He was awarded the C.M.G. in 1919. He served as Director of Movements and Quartering in India from 1920 to 1921, then as Deputy Adjutant- and Quartermaster-General of Eastern Command from 1921 to 1922. Political career Charteris left the Army in 1922. From 1924 until 1929 he was Unionist Party British Member of Parliament for Dumfriesshire. His areas of political interest was in farming, and the welfare of British war veterans. Publications He published three books in his later years concerning his military service, 'Field Marshal Earl Haig' (1929), 'At GHQ' (1931), and \\"Haig\\" (1933) (a condensed version of the 1929 biography). His writings were considered controversial. He had not kept a diary at the time so 'At GHQ' consisted of papers, notes and letters from the time re-written into diary form. He confessed to sometimes amplifying from memory but by and large the reconstructed \\"diary\\" is consistent with records which he kept at the time, e.g. his entry for the First Day of the Somme which he states was \\"not an attempt to win the war at a blow\\", and that \\"weeks of hard fighting\\" lay ahead. \\"At GHQ\\" also contains a letter from Charteris with the date 5 September 1914, noting that \\"the story of the Angels of Mons [is] going strong through the 2nd Corps\\". If authentic, this may be the earliest account of the rumour, predating Arthur Machen's The Bowmen--widely held to be the source of the Angels of Mons legend. However, examination of Charteris' original letters gives evidence that these entries and/or dates were falsified,Rumours of Angels: a response to Simpson, Folklore, April 2004 by David Clarke leading David Clarke, among others, to suggest that Charteris was using the Angels rumour for propaganda purposes. Death Charteris died at the age of 69 on 4 February 1946 at his home, 'Bourne House', in the village of Thorpe, in the county of Surrey.Entry for Charteris in the 'Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'. His body was buried in the graveyard of Tinwald Kirk (Church), in Dumfries and Galloway, which also displays a memorial stained glass window to his memory.Entry for the stained glass windows dedicated to the Charteris's at Tinwald Church, Scottish Military Research Group website, published online 9 January 2007. http://warmemscot.s4.bizhat.com/warmemscot-ftopic1739.html His will was valued for probate at ¬£6,895 4s 11d (around ¬£250,000 at 2016 prices). Personal life He married Noel Hodgson in October 1913.

Evangelical Lutheran Church in America  The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran church body in the United States, allows for LGBTQ+ marriage and ordination of LGBTQ+ clergy. ELCA policy states that LGBTQ+ individuals are welcome and encouraged to become members and to participate in the life of the congregation. The ELCA has provided supplemental resources for the rite of marriage in Evangelical Lutheran Worship which use inclusive language and are suitable for use in LGBTQ+ marriage ceremonies. The group ReconcilingWorks supports the full inclusion of LGBTQ+ members in Lutheran churches in the ELCA, and provides resources to assist ELCA congregations in becoming more welcoming communities for LGBTQ+ persons. ReconcilingWorks recognizes ELCA congregations that have committed to embracing LGBTQ+ persons as Reconciling in Christ congregations. The current policy on LGBTQ+ inclusion in the ELCA developed over a period of several years. In 2001, a Social Statement on Sexuality was requested by the Churchwide Assembly and entrusted to a Task Force. In light of the ongoing work of that task force, the 2007 Churchwide Assembly passed a resolution asking bishops to exercise restraint in discipline of those congregations and pastors in violation of 'Vision and Expectations.' Prior to August 2009, the ELCA expected \\"ordained ministers who are homosexual in their self- understanding\\" to \\"abstain from homosexual sexual relationships\\". The 2009 ELCA Churchwide Assembly in Minneapolis passed \\"Human Sexuality, Gift and Trust\\",ELCA:Legislative summary 4 & 5 which approved more positive assessments of same-gender partnerships in the church. On 21 August 2009, the same body passed four ministry policy resolutions that opened the way for congregations to recognize and support such partnerships and for those in committed same- gender partnerships to be rostered leaders within the ELCA.ELCA:Legislative summary 8 & 9 StarTribune:ELCA validates 'chaste' same-sex relationships A separate motion at the same assembly recommended that a rite of blessing for same-sex unions be provided.

For registered partnerships, the church says that \\"the [same-sex] couple may organise prayers with a priest or other church workers and invited guests.\\" Additionally, Archbishop Kari M√§kinen expressed his support for the new law permitting same- gender marriages. In 2016, although the bishops in Finland did not agree to perform same-sex marriages, \\"bishops have taken the position that it is possible to hold prayer services to bless same-sex couples.\\" Tens of thousands of Finns have resigned from the church during the 2010s due to comments made by church officials either supporting or condemning same sex marriages and relations.Eroakirkosta.fi - Tasa-arvoinen avioliitto -√§√§netys sai konservatiivit eroamaan kirkostaEroakirkosta.fi - Yli 56 000 eronnut t√§n√§ vuonna - Homoillan j√§lkeen 30 000 eroamista The Church of Iceland allows same- sex marriage. https://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=12303 = South America =  Argentina and Uruguay  The Evangelical Church of the River Plate, which includes Lutherans and Waldensians, and the United Lutheran Church have supported civil unions and same-sex marriages.

K. Rowling, which range from them containing criticism of racism to anti-government sentiments. According to Inside Higher Ed, doctoral theses have been devoted to the Harry Potter books.McLemee, Scott Pottering Around Inside Higher Ed, 18 July 2007 There are also several university courses centred on analysis of the Potter series, including an upper division political science course. *The Telegraph, 2007-07-20. *Edinburgh News , The Scotsman. *Babson professor makes Harry P. an academic star *\\"Wisdom of Harry Potter\\" author to offer fall college course *Charlotte Observer * Time magazine noted the political and social aspects of Harry Potter in their 2007 Person of the Year issue where Rowling placed third behind politicians Vladimir Putin and Al Gore. Harry Potters potential social and political impact was called similar to the 19th-century phenomenon of Harriet Beecher Stowe's popular, but critically maligned, book, Uncle Tom's Cabin, which fuelled the abolitionist movement leading up to the American Civil War.*Readers Of the World, Unite: Metro Santa Cruz *Time Magazine When asked about the politics and message in Harry Potter, Rowling explained, \\"I wanted Harry to leave our world and find exactly the same problems in the wizarding world. So you have the intent to impose a hierarchy, you have bigotry, and this notion of purity, which is this great fallacy, but it crops up all over the world. People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity. [...] It wasn't really exclusively that. I think you can see in the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love.\\" She also said, \\"You should question authority and you should not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth.\\" *Entertainment Weekly, October 2007 *The Leaky Cauldron The Wall Street Journal compared Neville Chamberlain to Rowling's Cornelius Fudge, saying both were eager to help their constituents look the other way to avoid war. \\"Throughout the '30s, Chamberlain, fearing that Churchill was out for his job, conducted a campaign against his fellow Tory. Chamberlain tried evading war with Germany, and ridiculed Churchill as a 'warmonger'. He used The Times‚Äîthe government's house organ‚Äîto attack Churchill and suppress dispatches from abroad about the Nazis that would have vindicated him.\\" Rowling confirmed Chamberlain was her inspiration in the Spanish newspaper magazine XLSemanal. Rowling also told the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant that Voldemort was modeled on Hitler and Stalin, as a megalomaniac and paranoid figure, and that she was influenced by the Second World War, which is \\"anchored in all our minds\\": discussing Draco Malfoy, she claimed \\"Draco Malfoy does indeed stand for that type of boy. He wouldn‚Äôt have killed Dumbledore, he couldn‚Äôt. As long as things are imaginary, okay, but once it becomes reality, the thing becomes more difficult.\\", on the other hand, \\"No, that I gave him that light blonde hair is not because I wanted to make him into a scary Nazi. You give your characters the appearance that you find attractive\\". Education versus indoctrination Entertainment Weekly noted that the post-9/11 generation's \\"ideas about war, about leadership, about the dangers of consolidation of power and of dictatorship, about the importance of dissent, and about heroism and sacrifice, have been shaped at least in part by Rowling,\\" and that their concept of freedom of speech has been influenced by Rowling's weathering of her books' routine challenges.The Top 25 Entertainers of the year Entertainment Weekly Bill O'Reilly joined in the political fray over Harry Potter character Albus Dumbledore's outing by asking if it was part of a \\"gay agenda\\" to indoctrinate children. He called J. K. Rowling a provocateur for telling fans about Dumbledore's sexuality after the books were written. His guest, Entertainment Weekly Senior Editor Tina Jordan, called his \\"indoctrination\\" claims \\"a shallow argument\\", saying \\"indoctrination is a very strong word\\" because \\"we all know gay people, whether we know it or not.\\"The O'Reilly Factor, Fox News Channel. 23 October 2007. O'Reilly continued the following day saying that the real problem is Rowling is teaching \\"tolerance\\" and \\"parity for homosexuals with heterosexuals\\". His guest Dennis Miller said that tolerance was good and didn't think you could indoctrinate a child into being gay.The O'Reilly Factor, Fox News Channel. 24 October 2007. Zenit, a news agency dedicated to promoting the message of the Catholic Church, accused Rowling of betraying her readers by disclosing Dumbledore's sexuality, and said Rowling is the wealthiest woman in Britain thanks to the lack of political, social or moral propaganda in her books. The head of Human Life International, an American-based Roman Catholic activist pro-life organisation, taking a negative view of the books and \\"their literary offspring\\", said that Harry Potter indoctrinates young souls in the language and mechanics of the occult and said that Rowling's portrayal of Dumbledore socialises if not indoctrinates young people into tolerance of gays. The Berkeley Beacon said that one parent's perception of indoctrination is another's education, in their article, No Politics in Harry Potter, which countered charges that Rowling promoted homosexuality in her books. Discussing the controversy, Rowling told the BBC that \\"Christian fundamentalists were never my base\\" and thought it ridiculous to question if a gay person could be a moral compass in the 21st century. Discussing the values and morality of her characters Draco and Dudley, Rowling explained that both were indoctrinated with their parents' beliefs. \\"The moment Draco got what he thought he wanted, to become a Death Eater, and given a mission by Lord Voldemort, as he did in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, reality finally hit him,\\" Rowling said, because his dream was \\"so very different\\". She said that there was a real moral cowardice to Draco, but that he was not wholly bad. Racism, mistreatment of minorities and totalitarianism The \\"pure-blood\\", \\"half- blood\\" and \\"Mudblood\\"/\\"Muggle-born\\" divisions used in Harry Potter are redolent of the system distinguishing Jews, Germans, \\"mixed blood: first degree\\" and \\"mixed blood: second degree\\" in Nazi Germany, as in this chart. Analysts note the criticism of racism in J. K. Rowling's texts.*Harry Potter and the Complicated Identity Politics * When asked about the theme of racism and if her books have changed how people think, Rowling said, \\"I do not think I am pessimistic but I think I am realistic about how much you can change deeply entrenched prejudice, so my feeling would be that if someone were a committed racist, possibly Harry Potter is not going to have an effect.\\"Transcript of the Harry Potter Children's Press Conference Weekend When asked in a post-Deathly Hallows webchat about Hermione's future, Rowling said, \\"Hermione began her post-Hogwarts career at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures where she was instrumental in greatly improving life for house-elves and their ilk. She then moved to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement where she was a progressive voice who ensured the eradication of oppressive, pro-pureblood laws.\\"Webchat with J. K. Rowling, 30 July 2007 www.bloomsbury.com After the publication of Deathly Hallows, Rowling responded to queries about metaphors in the books for ethnic cleansing: \\"Well, it is a political metaphor. But... I didn't sit down and think, 'I want to recreate Nazi Germany', in the‚Äîin the wizarding world. Because‚Äîalthough there are‚Äîquite consciously overtones of Nazi Germany, there are also associations with other political situations. So I can't really single one out.\\"Harry Potter: The final chapter . MSNBC. Retrieved 9 August 2007. Rowling also compared her character Voldemort to paranoid megalomaniacs like Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. In her 2007 book tour Rowling further discussed the topic, stating \\"It wasn't really exclusively that. I think you can see in the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love.\\" She prefaced the remark, saying \\"People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity.\\" Rowling stated on her website that the Harry Potter phrases 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle- born' compared to \\"some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to notice the similarity.\\"J. K. Rowling Official WebsiteFaqs Christopher Hitchens noted in The New York Times that the lightning bolt‚Äîthe shape of the scar which Harry received as a result of Voldemort's curse, now considered to be emblematic of the series‚Äîis also the symbol of Sir Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists, a prominent group of Nazi sympathisers during the 1930s and 1940s.Hitchens, Christopher. The Boy Who Lived, published 12 August 2007. The Nazis themselves, in their SS, made use of the symbol too. In the same article, Hitchens noted that \\"The prejudice against bank-monopoly goblins is modeled more or less on anti- Semitism and the foul treatment of elves is meant to put us in mind of slavery\\". J. K. Rowling mentions in an article that Mosley was married to Diana Mitford, sister of her heroine, Jessica Mitford. Jessica, after whom Rowling named her daughter, never forgave Diana's Nazi sympathies.J. K. Rowling: \\"The First It Girl.\\" Sunday Telegraph Oswald and Diana married in 1936, in the Berlin home of Nazi chief Joseph Goebbels with Adolf Hitler as a guest. J. K. Rowling also noted that Mitford's other sister Unity, to whom Jessica was closest in youth, became an arch-fascist and favourite of Adolf Hitler's. Jessica's story may have thus inspired a part of Harry's story: Narcissa Black (analogue to Diana Mosley) married a Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy (Oswald Mosley). Her sister, Bellatrix (Unity Mitford), was herself a Death Eater, and a favourite of Lord Voldemort (Adolf Hitler). Andromeda (Jessica Mitford) married the Muggle-born Ted Tonks against her family's wishes (as Jessica eloped with her cousin Esmond Romilly) and was blasted out of the family-tree tapestry. These parallels were noted in the American communist newspaper People's Weekly World. In an act commemorating the Holocaust, actor Daniel Radcliffe, whose mother is Jewish, donated his first pair of Harry Potter glasses to an art exhibition inspired by a famous World War II photo of a mangled mountain of spectacles of victims of ethnic cleansing. Radcliffe's Potter co-star Jason Isaacs, who played Lucius Malfoy in the films, himself a Jewish Briton, was due to participate in the commemorations on National Holocaust Memorial Day, leading a service at Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall. Aviva Chomsky (daughter of famed academic Noam Chomsky) in the Providence Journal suggests that Harry Potter is a parable on immigration rights, noting that US \\"immigration, citizenship and naturalization laws are based explicitly on discrimination on the basis of national origin.

Providence Journal, 13 September 2007 Evils of war On the Harry Potter series, Rowling said on her United States book tour in October 2007, \\"I very consciously wanted to show what is one of the great evils of war, which is that totally innocent people are slaughtered... Another great evil of war is that children lose their families.\\"*New Orleans students give Rowling a rousing welcome *Transcript of J. K. Rowling's live interview on Scholastic.com Progressive values and diversity Time magazine said in 2005, \\"Rowling adapts an inherently conservative genre for her own progressive purposes. Her Hogwarts is secular and sexual and multicultural and multiracial and even sort of multimedia, with all those talking ghosts.\\"Grossman, Lev J. K. Rowling, Hogwarts and all Time, 17 July 2005 To mark the French publication of Deathly Hallows, prominent French center-left paper Liberation devoted the front cover and two more pages to answering the question \\"Why Harry Potter is of the Left\\". In 2007, responding to a question from a child about Dumbledore's love life, Rowling revealed, \\"I always saw Dumbledore as gay.\\" Filling in a few more details, she said, \\"Dumbledore fell in love with Grindelwald.... Don't forget, falling in love can blind us. [He] was very drawn to this brilliant person. This was Dumbledore's tragedy.\\" Melissa Anelli, webmaster of the fan site The Leaky Cauldron, told The Associated Press, \\"Jo Rowling calling any Harry Potter character gay would make wonderful strides in tolerance toward homosexuality.... By dubbing someone so respected, so talented and so kind, as someone who just happens to be also homosexual, she's reinforcing the idea that a person's gayness is not something of which they should be ashamed.\\" Of the ensuing controversy, Rowling said, \\"I know that it was a positive thing that I said it, for at least one person, because one man 'came out' at Carnegie Hall.\\"Rowling knew early on Dumbledore was gay The Star Entertainment Weeklys Mark Harris said \\"her choice to make a beloved professor-mentor gay in a world where gay teachers are still routinely slandered as malign influences was, I am certain, no accident.\\" Harris also says that there is a drastic underrepresentation of gays in the population, and it is a failure of decency and nerve on the entertainment industry‚Äî \\"including the tremendous number of gay producers, writers, and executives who sacrifice their convictions so they don't look too strident or political.\\" According to Think Progress, a progressive news site, conservative blogs say Rowling's revelation about Dumbledore vindicates Jerry Falwell's attacks on homosexuality in children's media that were lambasted by the mass media. \\"What's stopping her from saying that [Harry's friend] Neville grows up to be a paedophile?\\" said David Baggett, an associate philosophy professor at Falwell's Liberty University's School of Religion. Baggett, who coauthored the book Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts, says he was taken aback not only by Rowling's announcement, but by the fact that it came on the heels of her confirming many Potter fans' belief that the series had Christian themes. Slate Magazine quotes an attendee of the book talk who said, \\"It was clear that JKR didn't plan to out Dumbledore. She just cares about being true to her readers.\\" Mike Thomas of the Orlando Sentinel said that upon reflection, Dumbledore was gay from the beginning, and that this neatly explains the behaviour of his character and his relationship with Grindelwald. Thomas notes the skill Rowling displays in writing a gay character without having to put a gay label on him. According to Reuters, Rowling was surprised over the fuss and declined to say whether her \\"outing\\" of Dumbledore might alienate those who disapprove of homosexuality. \\"It has certainly never been news to me that a brave and brilliant man could love other men. He is my character. He is what he is and I have the right to say what I say about him,\\" she said. Reaction has been mainly supportive on fans' Web sites, such as The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet. Actor David Thewlis (Remus Lupin) said that he was surprised about Dumbledore's sexuality, because while he was filming Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban director Alfonso Cuar√≥n had the idea that \\"Lupin was gay, and he described my character like a 'gay junkie'.\\" Catholic fantasy author Regina Doman wrote an essay titled \\"In Defense of Dumbledore\\", in which she argued that the books actually support Catholic teaching on homosexuality because Dumbledore's relationship with the dark wizard Grindelwald leads to obviously terrible results, as he becomes interested in dark magic himself, neglects his responsibilities towards his younger sister and ultimately causes her death. The South Florida Sun-Sentinels book reviewer Chauncey Mabe says that it was wrong for Rowling to disclose Dumbledore's sexual orientation. Mabe was clear that this was not due to Dumbledore's being gay, but to his own objections to authors continuing to talk about their books after they are written. He called for Rowling to \\"please be quiet, please\\" in \\"public gatherings\\", which is contrary to the massive popularity of Rowling's book talks and her fans' thirst for more information about characters in the Harry Potter books. Mabe notes that 1,000 children attended the \\"reading\\" before they were given autographed books. Robin Berkowitz, Sun-Sentinel Entertainment Editor says of Rowling's comments, and other revelations she might make about her characters \\"We don't need to know any of them to appreciate the books fully,\\" \\"Don't ask, don't spell\\" a reference to the U.S. military's former policy on homosexuality, Don't ask, don't tell. These sentiments are mirrored by Jeffrey Weiss in his article, \\"Harry Potter and the author who wouldn't shut up\\", published in the Dallas Morning News.Harry Potter and the author who wouldn't shut up The Washington Posts Michael Gerson says \\"tolerance is one of the main themes of the Harry Potter books. In a marvelous social comparison, lycanthropy is treated as a kind of chronic disease, with werewolves subject to discrimination as if they had AIDS.\\" Social activism According to Philip Nel of Kansas State University, the Potter series can be seen as \\"political novels that critique racism and racial superiority. Rowling, who worked for Amnesty International, evokes her social activism through Hermione's passion for oppressed elves and the formation of her \\"Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.\\" Dobby the house elf has been compared to the labour lawyer Dobby Walker who introduced Rowling's heroine, Jessica Mitford, to the Communist Party.*Morag Traynor, Is Dobby a Communist? HP-Lexicon *Readers Of the World, Unite: Metro Santa Cruz *UK Independent Hermione is depicted as starting a campaign to emancipate the enslaved House elves, using the methods of real-world campaigns on social and political issues such as badges with slogans. She persists in this campaigning also when it is considered quixotic even by her close friends and not much appreciated even by most of the House elves themselves. But in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the campaign turns out to have had enormous unforeseen results, with House elves joining the struggle and making several indispensable contributions to Voldemort's final defeat and saving the main protagonists' lives. Rowling said in an early interview that Hermione and her political conscience about the rights of elves was fairly autobiographical. Neoconservatism It has been argued that in many ways the Harry Potter series appears to have a neoconservative message, particularly during and after Order of the Phoenix, which happened to be the first Harry Potter book published after 9/11, when neoconservatism was at its strongest political position.http://www.archconuga.com/2014/11/19/yer-a-neocon-harry/ Specifically, the struggle between Harry and Voldemort is framed in a Manichaean spirit of good confronting evil, and in particular of freedom versus tyranny, a theme that has been commonly identified with neoconservative ideology in many works.https://slate.com/human-interest/2004/05/what-connects- harry-potter-to-left-behind.htmlhttps://visceralbrooklyn.com/how- characterisation-creates-the-theme-of-good-vs-evil-in-the-harry-potter- series/https://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2008/02/the-two-faces-of- neoconservatism/55397/https://www.jstor.org/stable/26326171 Furthermore, the heroes of the story repeatedly accuse Cornelius Fudge of deliberately obfuscating the threat of Voldemort, reminiscent of when many neoconservatives accused President Obama and other Democrats with the charge that they did not call out ISIS as pertaining to Islamic extremism, or downplaying the nature of the Islamist threat.https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/13/politics/islamic- terrorism-trump-obama- clinton/index.htmlhttps://www.vox.com/2015/11/16/9745334/obama-radical-islam- isishttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/define-the-enemy-republicans-counter- obamas-radical-islam-slam Similarly, they were against appeasement, and wanted to confront Voldemort directly, such as by setting up the Order of the Phoenix and Harry training Dumbledore's Army to defend against Voldemort and his Death Eater. Many neocons have warned of \\"the lessons of Munich\\", and Neville Chamberlain's appeasement, particularly when it came to states such as the Soviet Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran.https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/03/weekinreview/03stolberg.htmlhttps://www.unz.com/print/PolicyRev-1987q3-00069https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-2002-sep-01-op- heilbrunn01-story.htmlhttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-01-05/what- a-soviet-dissident-sees-in-iran-s-unresthttps://www.amazon.com/Wages- Appeasement-Ancient-Athens-America/dp/1594035199 Subversive and anarchistic message Gerson of the Washington Post also described what he considered to be the very subversive nature of the Harry Potter books in the answer they offer to death. Voldemort believes that death must be mastered and \\"beaten\\". In contrast, Harry accepts the necessity of his own death for the sake of love. Gerson also suggests that some will ask the book series about tolerance also be a book series about religion. He answers that many others \\"believe ‚Äì not in spite of their faith but because of it ‚Äì that half-bloods, werewolves and others should be treated with kindness and fairness. Above all, believers are called to love, even at the highest cost.\\" In a 1999 interview with Rowling, The Guardian Unlimiteds Joanna Carey said, \\"JK Rowling is every bit as witty and subversive as you'd expect. Rowling described her admiration of Jessica Mitford since age 14, her time at Exeter University \\"not quite the chance to be the 'radical' I planned\\", and said the later books dealing with Harry's hormones, and deaths would be unlike other children's series like the Famous Five. Carey suggested a parallel between Harry Potter and Prince Harry which Rowling laughs off saying a friend said never let the press make you discuss the royal family.\\" James Morone, a political science professor at Brown University, wrote in the liberal American Prospect in 2001, \\"Magical headmaster Albus Dumbledore practically awards bonus points for breaking rules. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is unruly, even slightly anarchic. Harry's classmate Hermione 'had become a bit more relaxed about breaking the rules,' writes Rowling near the end of Philosopher's Stone, 'and she was much nicer for it.' There's more than a touch of anarchy when all the students sing to their own tune. In her books, the kids are the central agents of their own lives. They make choices. Weigh judgments. Wrestle with freedom.\\" Isabelle Smadja of Le Monde wrote that Harry Potter is the first fictional hero of the anti-globalist, anti-capitalist, pro-Third World, \\"Seattle\\" generation. She wrote that \\"Examination of the text suggests that they are, in fact, a ferocious critique of consumer society and the world of free enterprise.\\"French go potty over Harry's politics, Lichfield, John. The Star 5 July 2004 Conservative objections to liberal and socialist values The right-wing U.S. John Birch Society has objected to Rowling's books and her public statements. In his article for the John Birch Society's magazine The New American, Constitution Party Communications Director Steve Bonta compared Harry Potter negatively to The Lord of the Rings, saying, \\"The Potter books read in places like diatribes against the modern middle class, especially whenever Harry confronts his ludicrously dysfunctional and downright abusive adopted family, the Dursleys.\\" Accusations of conservative and sexist themes The critic Anthony Holden wrote in The Observer on his experience of judging Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 1999 Whitbread Awards. His overall view of the series was very negative‚Äî\\"the Potter saga was essentially patronising, very conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain.\\" A review in The Guardian echoed this interpretation and stated that \\"despite all of the books' gestures to multiculturalism and gender equality, Harry Potter is a conservative; a paternalistic, One-Nation Tory, perhaps, but a Tory nonetheless.\\" Salon.com critic Christine Schoefer has also criticised the books as sexist, claiming that the series presents a patriarchal world filled with stereotypes and adherence to \\"the conventional assumption that men do and should run the world\\". When an interviewer suggested her books portrayed a conservative world, Rowling replied, \\"So I'm told repeatedly. The two groups of people who are constantly thanking me are Wiccans and boarding schools. And really, don't thank me. I'm not with either of them. New ageism leaves me completely cold, and [my daughter] would never go to boarding school. I went to a comprehensive.\\"Hattenstone, Simon. \\"Harry, Jessica and me\\", The Guardian, 8 July 2000. Rowling says she gets frustrated with the \\"conservative world thing\\". She made Hogwarts a boarding school so that action could happen in the middle of the night and to create a sense of community among the characters.

Rowling's Books That Made a Difference O, The Oprah Magazine January 2001 Neoliberal and capitalist values In an article published in prominent French newspaper Le Monde, literary scholar Ilias Yocaris argued that Harry Potter \\"probably unintentionally ... appears as a summary of the social and educational aims of neoliberal capitalism.\\" According to Yocaris' analysis, all life at Hogwarts is dominated by a culture of competition: \\"competition among students to be prefect; competition among Hogwarts houses to gain points; competition among sorcery schools to win the Triwizard tournament; and, ultimately, the bloody competition between the forces of Good and Evil.\\" The free market plays a prominent and positive role, while the state (the Ministry of Magic) is presented as inefficient and bureaucratic. In this \\"pitiless jungle\\", education only aims to \\"give students an immediately exploitable practical knowledge that can help them in their battle to survive,\\" while artistic subjects and social sciences are useless or absent. Yocaris concludes that \\"like Orwellian totalitarianism, this capitalism tries to fashion not only the real world, but also the imagination of consumer-citizens,\\" producing literature that suggests that no alternative is possible. In an article published in Journal of Contemporary Religion, Michael Ostling also argued that the series depicts a modern capitalist and consumerist society, where the role of gadgetry is played by magic.Harry Potter and the Disenchantment of the World. By Michael Ostling. Journal of Contemporary Religion, Vol. 18, No. 1, 2003. pp. 3‚Äì23 The article by Yocaris provoked the response by Isabelle Smadja cited previously. Class distinctions O: The Oprah Magazine noted that Rowling admires Roddy Doyle and Jane Austen, saying \\"both of whom write about class distinctions,\\" and asked if the reason Rowling wrote about class was a conscious decision. Rowling replied, \\"kids are acutely aware of money‚Äîbefore they're aware of class. A kid isn't really going to notice how another kid holds his knife and fork. But a kid will be acutely aware that he doesn't have pocket money. Or that he doesn't have as much pocket money. I think back to myself at 11. Kids can be mean, very mean. So it was there in Ron not having the proper length robes, you know? And not being able to buy stuff on the trolley. He's got to have sandwiches his mum made for him, even though he doesn't like the sandwiches. Having enough money to fit in is an important facet of life‚Äîand what is more conformist than a school?\\" Anti- government interpretation Some political commentators have seen J. K. Rowling's portrayal of the bureaucratised Ministry of Magic and the oppressive measures taken by the Ministry in the later books (like making attendance at Hogwarts School compulsory and the \\"registration of Mudbloods\\" with the Ministry) as an allegory criticising the state. The Anti-Government Message Is Being Spread Through Sci-Fi/Fantasy and Harry Potter vs. Compulsory Schooling at LewRockwell.com The People's Weekly World, the newspaper of the Communist Party USA, claims the books draw you \\"into the politics of the wizarding world‚Äîthe 'Educational Decrees' from the toad-like Ministry of Magic representative, the high-level connections of 'war criminals' from the last rise of Voldemort, the against 'mudbloods' and 'half-breeds.'\\" They suggest connections \\"to the world we live in, to the similarities and differences between the Fudge administration and the Bush administration\\".Barnett, Jennifer. People's Weekly World Newspaper \\"Harry Potter and the irresistible read\\", 10 July 2003. Archived from the original on 27 September 2007 Philosopher Jean-Claude Milner claimed \\"Harry Potter is a war machine against the Thatcherite-Blairist world and the 'American Way of Life'\\" in France's Lib√©ration. University of Tennessee law professor Benjamin Barton discusses libertarian aspects of Harry Potter in his paper Harry Potter and the Half- Crazed Bureaucracy, published in the Michigan Law Review. Barton says, \\"Rowling's scathing portrait of government is surprisingly strident and effective. This is partly because her critique works on so many levels: the functions of government, the structure of government, and the bureaucrats who run the show. All three elements work together to depict a Ministry of Magic run by self-interested bureaucrats bent on increasing and protecting their power, often to the detriment of the public at large. In other words, Rowling creates a public-interest scholar's dream‚Äîor nightmare‚Äîgovernment.\\"Harry Potter and the Half-Crazed Bureaucracy Michigan Law Review Rowling describes the beloved wizard Dumbledore as Machiavellian and says \\"I wanted you to question Dumbledore. It is right to question him, because he was treating people like puppets, and he was asking Harry to do a job that most men twice his age wouldn't have been able to do.\\" Characters compared to George Bush, Tony Blair, and Saddam Hussein Newsweek magazine asked Alfonso Cuar√≥n, director of the third film based on Rowling's Prisoner of Azkaban if the villainous wizard Voldemort still reminded him of George W. Bush. Cuar√≥n confirmed, \\"In combination with Saddam. They both have selfish interests and are very much in love with power. Also, a disregard for the environment. A love for manipulating people. I read books four and five, and Fudge is similar to Tony Blair. He's the ultimate politician. He's in denial about many things. And everything is for the sake of his own persona, his own power. The way the Iraq thing was handled was not unlike the way Fudge handled affairs in book four.\\" *Pierce, Nev. Reel Life ‚Äì 28 July 2003 BBC *Carla Power and Devin Gordon, Caution: Wizard at Work. Newsweek magazine, 4 August 2003 Slate Magazine also says Rowling takes jabs at the Bush and Blair administrations suggesting the Ministry of Magic's security pamphlet recalls the much-scorned Operation TIPS (Terrorism Information and Prevention System). The author also suggests that Azkaban, the wizard penitentiary, is a stand-in for Guantanamo Bay.Turner, Julia When Harry Met Osama; Terrorism comes to Hogwarts. 20 July 2005 Rowling has never confirmed these interpretations in Harry Potter; however, when the then Chancellor Gordon Brown once asked her to endorse the Labour Party while Tony Blair was Prime Minister, Rowling refused. Rowling attacked the Blair government's policy on single parent families. She said that Labour could do \\"a good deal more\\" and then donated ¬£500,000 to the One Parent Families charity to set an example. Rowling said that Brown's measures for children 'would have made a real difference to my family's life' when she was poor. Blair stepped down shortly before the release of Rowling's seventh book, and Brown was appointed Prime Minister. Rowling subsequently donated ¬£1 million to the Labour Party during the 2010 general election which Labour lost. Education reform in The Order of the Phoenix Teachers have hailed Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix as a \\"blistering satire on years of politically motivated interference in the running of schools\\".Fraser, Stephen Rowling causes umbrage with her Umbridge... Scotsman Rowling describes her character Dolores Umbridge, the Ministry-appointed headmistress of Hogwarts and under-secretary to the minister, Cornelius Fudge, saying \\"She has good contacts at the Ministry. She is one of those people, and they do exist in real life, who will always side with the established order. As far as she is concerned authority cannot be wrong so she doesn't question it, and I would go as far as to say that whatever happened and whoever took over at the Ministry, Umbridge would be there, she likes power. So she is going to side with the people who give her the authority.\\" Andrew Slack, founder of the Harry Potter Alliance, writes in In These Times about the \\"Muggle Mindset\\" in which \\"Lindsay Lohan supersedes news about genocide, men assess their 'worth' by their paychecks, women's bodies are treated as commodities and our educational system preoccupies itself not with stimulating children's curiosity but rather getting them to efficiently regurgitate information on standardised tests.\\" Hungarian Secretary of State for Education R√≥zsa Hoffmann and her reforms have often been compared to Dolores Umbridge and her actions in the novels. Anti- terrorism The Capitalism Magazine website says that, \\"With a long-term war in progress and threats of further terrorist attacks on American soil,\\" Harry Potter isn't mere escapism and \\"shows a world in which happiness can be achieved, villains can be defeated, and the means of success can be learned.\\"Durante, Dianne. Thank You, Harry Potter! 22 August 2003 Time magazine says that by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, \\"Harry is embroiled in a borderless, semi-civil war with a shadowy, hidden leader whose existence the government ignored until disaster forced the issue and who is supported by a secret network of sleeper agents willing to resort to tactics of shocking cruelty. The kids who grew up on Harry Potter‚Äîyou could call them Generation Hex‚Äîare the kids who grew up with the pervasive threat of terrorism, and it's inevitable that on some level they'll make a connection between the two.\\" Slate Magazines Julia Turner compares Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to the War on Terror in the context of the fight against Osama bin Laden saying Voldemort takes up terrorism by destroying bridges, murdering innocents, and forcing children to kill their elders. She also notes the parallels in the community's response saying Fred and George Weasley's shop makes a mint selling Shield Cloaks and the new Minister for Magic jails an innocent man, hoping to stave off panic and create the impression that he's taking action. Rowling said \\"I've never thought, 'It's time for a post-9/11 Harry Potter book,' no. But what Voldemort does, in many senses, is terrorism, and that was quite clear in my mind before 9/11 happened.... but there are parallels, obviously. I think one of the times I felt the parallels was when I was writing about the arrest of Stan Shunpike, you know? I always planned that these kinds of things would happen, but these have very powerful resonances, given that I believe, and many people believe, that there have been instances of persecution of people who did not deserve to be persecuted, even while we're attempting to find the people who have committed utter atrocities. These things just happen, it's human nature. There were some very startling parallels at the time I was writing it.\\" Academic Steven Fielding argues in A State of Play: British Politics on Screen, Stage and Page, from Anthony Trollope to The Thick of It that the changing portray of the Ministry of Magic ‚Äì from incompetent to authoritarian ‚Äì reflects Rowling's views on the War on Terror.Fielding.

The site evolved into kidSPEAK!, a forum for children to tackle censorship in general, and to fight for Harry Potter specifically. =The Harry Potter Alliance= Andrew Slack, an actor/comedian and Harry Potter aficionado, co- founded the Harry Potter Alliance to highlight the crisis in Sudan and social inequities. In These Times featured Slack in 2007, in an article about Muggle Activists where Slack said, \\"The Harry Potter parallel to Darfur is simple: With both the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet (the Wizarding World's mainstream news source) in denial that Voldemort has returned and evil is afoot, Harry and his underground rebel group, 'Dumbledore's Army,' work with the adult group, 'The Order of the Phoenix,' to awake the world. We in the Alliance seek to be Dumbledore's Army for the real world, working with anti- genocide organisations, such as 'Fidelity Out of Sudan' and the 'Genocide Intervention Network,' to wake our governments, corporations and media up to the fact that 'never again' means 'never again.'\\" When Time magazine asked about The Harry Potter Alliance, Rowling said, \\"It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting to see people going out there and doing that in the name of your character. What did my books preach against throughout? Bigotry, violence, struggles for power, no matter what. All of these things are happening in Darfur. So they really couldn't have chosen a better cause.\\" Rowling awarded The Harry Potter Alliance a Fan Site Award in December 2007. In February 2010, the HPA ran a massive fundraiser to support those in dire need after the tragic event of the Haiti earthquake. Live webcasts were held in which celebrities (especially those a part of the Harry Potter Fandom) performed and encouraged viewers to donate money. Donations came through an auction that did not guarantee you the prize. Some items that were up for bid were: a signed set of the Harry Potter books, a guitar signed by actor Tom Felton, handmade earrings from actress Evanna Lynch, and a one thousand word story about whatever the winner wishes it to be written by Maureen Johnson and John Green. The webcasts were rather successful, garnering over $125,000. The original plan of Helping Haiti Heal was to have three plane fulls of aid (each one dubbed: Harry, Hermione, and Ron) shipped off to Haiti. As of June the same year, five planes were sent to Haiti, Harry, Hermione, Ron, DFTBA (Don't Forget To Be Awesome) and the last being Dumbledore. On 28 June, there was a livestream video celebrating the landing of Dumbledore. Evanna Lynch was present at the stream and even answered questions asked by fans. Ophelia Dahl, the daughter of the late British author Roald Dahl was also present since she worked with Partners in Health, who the Harry Potter Alliance teamed up with for Helping Haiti Heal. In March 2010, The Harry Potter Alliance had a campaign for people to send in their books to the Mississippi Delta which went to Rwanda. As of June, when the campaign ended, they donated over 40,000 books. In July 2010, The Harry Potter Alliance won $250,000 in the Chase Community Giving contest. The money will go towards literacy, LGBT rights, and online community building. =Wal-Mart Watch= Wal-Mart Watch uses parodies of Harry Potter to compare Walmart to Lord Voldemort and draws analogies between House elves and forced labour.Harry Potter and the Dark Lord WaldeMart. =Stop Big Media= Stop Big Media gained support from \\"Rocking Out Against Voldemedia\\", a compilation of ten original songs by ten Harry Potter-themed \\"Wizard Rock\\" bands.

Symptoms may include pain, swelling, and bruising. There may be a decreased ability to move the arm and the person may present holding their elbow. Complications may include injury to an artery or nerve, and compartment syndrome. The cause of a humerus fracture is usually physical trauma such as a fall. Other causes include conditions such as cancer in the bone. Types include proximal humeral fractures, humeral shaft fractures, and distal humeral fractures. Diagnosis is generally confirmed by X-rays. A CT scan may be done in proximal fractures to gather further details. Treatment options may include a sling, splint, brace, or surgery. In proximal fractures that remain well aligned, a sling is often sufficient. Many humerus shaft fractures may be treated with a brace rather than surgery. Surgical options may include open reduction and internal fixation, closed reduction and percutaneous pinning, and intramedullary nailing. Joint replacement may be another option. Proximal and shaft fractures generally have a good outcome while outcomes with distal fractures can be less good. They represent about 4% of fractures. Signs and symptoms Closed shaft fracture in the middle of humerus After a humerus fracture, pain is immediate, enduring, and exacerbated with the slightest movements. The affected region swells, with bruising appearing a day or two after the fracture. The fracture is typically accompanied by a discoloration of the skin at the site of the fracture.Cameron, et al., 2014, p. 167‚Äì170 A crackling or rattling sound may also be present, caused by the fractured humerus pressing against itself. In cases in which the nerves are affected, then there will be a loss of control or sensation in the arm below the fracture. If the fracture affects the blood supply, then the patient will have a diminished pulse at the wrist. Displaced fractures of the humerus shaft will often cause deformity and a shortening of the length of the upper arm. Distal fractures may also cause deformity, and they typically limit the ability to flex the elbow. Causes Humerus fractures usually occur after physical trauma, falls, excess physical stress, or pathological conditions. Falls that produce humerus fractures among the elderly are usually accompanied by a preexisting risk factor for bone fracture, such as osteoporosis, a low bone density, or vitamin B deficiency.Cameron, et al., 2014, p. 167, 169 =Proximal= Proximal humerus fractures most often occur among elderly people with osteoporosis who fall on an outstretched arm. Less frequently, proximal fractures occur from motor vehicle accidents, gunshots, and violent muscle contractions from an electric shock or seizure.Crosby, et al., 2014, p. 4Auth, 2012, p. 167 Other risk factors for proximal fractures include having a low bone mineral density, having impaired vision and balance, and tobacco smoking.Crosby, et al., 2014, p. 23 A stress fracture of the proximal and shaft regions can occur after an excessive amount of throwing, such as pitching in baseball.Cuccurullo, 2014, p. 178 =Middle= Middle fractures are usually caused by either physical trauma or falls. Physical trauma to the humerus shaft tends to produce transverse fractures whereas falls tend to produce spiral fractures. Metastatic breast cancer may also cause fractures in the humerus shaft. Long spiral fractures of the shaft that are present in children may indicate physical abuse. =Distal= Distal humerus fractures usually occur as a result of physical trauma to the elbow region. If the elbow is bent during the trauma, then the olecranon is driven upward, producing a T- or Y-shaped fracture or displacing one of the condyles. Diagnosis Definitive diagnosis of humerus fractures is typically made through radiographic imaging. For proximal fractures, X-rays can be taken from a scapular anteroposterior (AP) view, which takes an image of the front of the shoulder region from an angle, a scapular Y view, which takes an image of the back of the shoulder region from an angle, and an axillar lateral view, which has the patient lie on his or her back, lift the bottom half of the arm up to the side, and have an image taken of the axilla region underneath the shoulder. Fractures of the humerus shaft are usually correctly identified with radiographic images taken from the AP and lateral viewpoints. Damage to the radial nerve from a shaft fracture can be identified by an inability to bend the hand backwards or by decreased sensation in the back of the hand. Images of the distal region are often of poor quality due to the patient being unable to extend the elbow because of pain. If a severe distal fracture is suspected, then a computed tomography (CT) scan can provide greater detail of the fracture. Nondisplaced distal fractures may not be directly visible; they may only be visible due to fat being displaced because of internal bleeding in the elbow.

There are three locations that humerus fractures occur: at the proximal location, which is the top of the humerus near the shoulder, in the middle, which is at the shaft of the humerus, and the distal location, which is the bottom of the humerus near the elbow.Cameron, et al., 2014, p. 167 Proximal fractures are classified into one of four types of fractures based on the displacement of the greater tubercle, the lesser tubercle, the surgical neck, and the anatomical neck, which are the four parts of the proximal humerus, with fracture displacement being defined as at least one centimeter of separation or an angulation greater than 45 degrees. One-part fractures involve no displacement of any parts of the humerus, two-part fractures have one part displaced relative to the other three; three-part fractures have two displaced fragments, and four- part fractures have all fragments displaced from each other.Cameron, et al., 2014, pp. 167‚Äì168Crosby, et al., 2014, pp. 11‚Äì19Cuccurullo, 2014, p. 177 Fractures of the humerus shaft are subdivided into transverse fractures, spiral fractures, \\"butterfly\\" fractures, which are a combination of transverse and spiral fractures, and pathological fractures, which are fractures caused by medical conditions.Cameron, et al., 2014, p. 169 Distal fractures are split between supracondylar fractures, which are transverse fractures above the two condyles at the bottom of the humerus, and intercondylar fractures, which involve a T- or Y-shaped fracture that splits the condyles.Cameron, et al., 2014, p. 170 Treatment The aim of treatment is to minimize pain and to restore as much normal function as possible. Most humerus fractures do not require surgical intervention. =Proximal= One-part and two-part proximal fractures can be treated with a collar and cuff sling, adequate pain medicine, and follow up therapy. Two-part proximal fractures may require open or closed reduction depending on neurovascular injury, rotator cuff injury, dislocation, likelihood of union, and function. For three- and four-part proximal fractures, standard practice is to have open reduction and internal fixation to realign the separate parts of the proximal humerus. A humeral hemiarthroplasty may be required in proximal cases in which the blood supply to the region is compromised.Cameron, et al., 2014, pp. 168‚Äì169 Compared with non-surgical treatment, surgery does not result in a better outcome for the majority of people with displaced proximal humeral fractures and is likely to result in a greater need for subsequent surgery. =Middle= Fractures of the humerus shaft are most often uncomplicated, closed fractures that require nothing more than pain medicine and wearing a cast or sling. For midshaft fractures up to 12 weeks may be required for healing. In shaft and distal cases in which complications such as damage to the neurovascular bundle exist, then surgical repair is required.Cameron, et al., 2014, pp. 169‚Äì170 Prognosis In most cases, people are discharged from an emergency department with pain medicine and a cast or sling. These fractures are typically minor and heal over the course of a few weeks. Fractures of the proximal region, especially among elderly people, may limit future shoulder activity.Malhotra, 2013, p. 47Crosby, et al., 2014, p. 31 Severe fractures are usually resolved with surgical intervention, followed by a period of healing using a cast or sling. Severe fractures often cause long-term loss of physical ability.Crosby, et al., 2014, p. 35 Complications in the recovery process of severe fractures include osteonecrosis, malunion or nonunion of the fracture, stiffness, and rotator cuff dysfunction, which require additional intervention in order for the people to fully recover. Epidemiology Humerus fractures are among the most common of fractures. Proximal fractures make up 5% of all fractures and 25% of humerus fractures, middle fractures about 60% of humerus fractures (12% of all fractures), and distal fractures the remainder. Among proximal fractures, 80% are one-part, 10% are two-part, and the remaining 10% are three- and four-part.Cameron, et al., 2014, p. 168 The most common location of proximal fractures is at the surgical neck of the humerus. Incidence of proximal fractures increases with age, with about 75% of cases occurring among people over the age of 60. In this age group, about three times as many women than men experience a proximal fracture.Crosby, et al., 2014, p. 1 Middle fractures are also common among the elderly, but they frequently occur among physically active young adult men who experience physical trauma to the humerus. Distal fractures are rare among adults, occurring primarily in children who experience physical trauma to the elbow region.

They released their first album on Columbia Records in 1980 self-titled Quincy, and an EP in 1983 entitled Don't Say No, using the band name Lulu Temple. Formation The band was formed by two sets of brothers, Stephen and Brian Butler, and Gerald and Alex Takach. The brothers had met while going to Haddon Heights High School in New Jersey during the 1970s and eventually forming Quincy, where they started off with an acoustic/electric soft rock sound with 4 part vocal harmonies. In 1976, Quincy did a month-long tour of the midwest with Bob Holden on drums. A few months later on Friday August 13, 1976, while playing at JC Dobbs club on South Street in Philadelphia, Alex Takach was mysteriously murdered. After a short period of inactivity, the band re-emerged embracing the punk/new wave movement. Gerald Takach took the stage name Gerald Emerick and the band added Wally Smith (aka Metro) on keyboards. They found their way to CBGB in New York and became a regular fixture in the late 1970s. They were managed by the owner of CBGB, Hilly Kristal. Quincy released a single on CBGB Records titled \\"Can't Live In A Dream\\"/\\"Salvation Fantasy\\". The band eventually signed with Columbia/CBS Records. The debut album was released to favorable reviews and enthusiasm at radio stations. Name change Shortly after the first album came out, Quincy Jones sued them for using his name. CBS Records did not help the band with the lawsuit. (Both the band and Jones recorded for CBS, and Jones was vastly more powerful than the band.) The band Quincy and Quincy Jones eventually settled out of court. The band then changed its name to Lulu Temple.Myspace The settlement stipulated that no mention could be made of the lawsuit in public. After a long battle to release a second record, the album Don't Say No was released under the new name Lulu Temple. In addition to the new name, the band took on a new musical direction adding horns and percussion and a more layered approach. Without the support of the label and the lack of press, even the band's fan base didn't know of their new record. Disbandment The band soon split up and went their separate ways in various musical and theatrical endeavors. The Butler brothers eventually founded the band Smash Palace, who are still together.

The Arbeiter- Zeitung, also known as the Chicagoer Arbeiter-Zeitung was a German-language, radical newspaper started in Chicago, Illinois in 1877 by veterans of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. It continued publishing through 1931. It was the first working-class newspaper in Chicago to last for a significant period, and sustained itself primarily through reader funding. The reader-owners removed several editors over its run due to disagreements over editorial policies. The Arbeiter-Zeitung was initially edited by German-American √©migr√©s Paul Grottkau and August Spies. Grottkau departed for Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1883 to establish the Milwaukee Arbeiter-Zeitung, leaving the Chicago paper in the hands of Spies, who was officially named editor in 1884.\\"Paul Grottkau, 1846-1898,\\" Dictionary of Wisconsin HIstory, Wisconsin Historical Society, www.wisconsinhistory.org/ In the early months of 1886, membership in Chicago Internationals (militant unions) swelled to record levels while the Arbeiter- Zeitung and the anarchist publication The Alarm (edited by the Parsons) unleashed a steady stream of editorials railing against capitalism. Labor leaders focused on the eight-hour work day as the means to a better life for working people. The newspaper complained that as wealthy businessmen lived opulently, workers suffered, and unemployment rose. Even in companies where profits rose sharply, employers cut wages. Strikes became more common ‚Äî and some led to violence. As a result of the Haymarket Square bombing of May 4, 1886, police arrested and investigated staff members of the Arbeiter-Zeitung. Its offices were raided, and speeches and writings published in the paper were part of the evidence used to convict and hang the anarchists who were arrested in its wake. Its editor, August Spies, and a typesetter, Adolph Fischer, were executed after a widely publicized, six-week trial; business manager Oscar Neebe and chief editorial assistant Michael Schwab were sentenced to death, but later pardoned. Prosecutors showed that, the night before the bombing, Fischer had proposed that the paper should publish the word \\"Ruhe\\" (peace) ‚Äî a call for armed men to assemble. The word did appear, highlighted in the May 4 edition. A staff member testified \\"Ruhe\\" was written in the hand of Spies. At his sentencing, Spies denounced the police and prosecution witnesses. He also charged that one witness, Gustav Legner, could prove his alibi but was threatened by police and paid to leave Chicago. Legner later sued the Arbeiter-Zeitung for libel for repeating Spies‚Äô claim of bribery, denying he was told to leave town. Legner said he asked Spies before leaving the city if he should testify and was told he would not be needed. The Arbeiter-Zeitung agreed to print a retraction. In the early 1900s Hippolyte Havel, a Czech anarchist from Austria-Hungary edited the newspaper. He had met Emma Goldman in London and returned with her from Europe. In Chicago, he lived in her household shared with Mary and Abe Isaak for a while. He later moved to New York, where he continued to edit anarchist papers.

The film depicts Donald Duck's first encounter with the two chipmunks Chip 'n' Dale when he unknowingly chops down their tree for firewood. The title of the film is the first appearance of the names of the two chipmunk characters who previously appeared without names in Private Pluto (1943) and Squatter's Rights (1946). The film Chip an' Dale is also the first time that Chip and Dale are distinguishable from each other, both physically and in personality. Chip an' Dale was directed by Jack Hannah and features original music by Oliver Wallace. The voice cast includes Clarence Nash as Donald and Jimmy MacDonald and Dessie Flynn as Chip and Dale respectively.Chip an' Dale at the Internet Movie Database Along with another Disney film, Pluto's Blue Note, Chip an' Dale was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1948. Both ultimately lost to Tweetie Pie, a film by Warner Bros.. Synopsis Donald Duck, while staying in a rustic winter cabin, gets out of bed to collect firewood for a fire. He chops down a small topped tree which happens to be the winter home of two chipmunks Chip and Dale who follow him back to the cabin. After Donald places the log in the fireplace, while Donald is looking for the matches Chip and Dale get their nuts out of the log but it's too late. lights it, and is warming himself by the fire, the chipmunks sneak in behind his back, extinguish the fire, and blatantly carry the log out of the cabin in front of Donald. A slightly amused Donald easily takes it from them as they leave the cabin. The chipmunks later climb the roof and throw snowballs down the chimney in order to extinguish Donald's fire. Donald climbs up the chimney, rolls the chipmunks into a snowball and rolls them off the roof. Coming up with a new plan, Chip whispers in Dale's ear. Dale listens intently, and nods, agreeing to the plan. Chip climbs a steep hill directly in front of the front door of Donald's cabin and rolls a snowball down the hill.

He has both played and coached the New Zealand national rugby league team. He is the current head coach of the Papakura Sea Eagles in the Auckland Rugby League. Playing career An Ellerslie club member, Kemble debuted for Auckland in 1976, aged only 19.Coffey and Wood The Kiwis: 100 Years of International Rugby League He then played rugby league at a senior level throughout the 1970s and 1980s, also playing for the Papakura club. His career included a first stint in the UK as a young unknown for Hunslet in 1977 / 78. After a successful tour with New Zealand in 1980 however he came to far greater prominence, beginning a lengthy stint with English club Hull F.C. during a golden period for the club. Debuting v Wakefield Trinity on 30 August 1981, achievements over the next year included; helping Hull to win the John Player Trophy, also being Premiership runners-up, he had taken Man of the Match in the Challenge Cup semi-final, scoring a 50-yard try rated as the best solo effort of the season, and lifting the Challenge Cup, the first time the Challenge Cup had been back at the Boulevard since 1914. Gary Kemble played in Hull FC's 14-14 draw with Widnes in the 1982 Challenge Cup Final during the 1981‚Äì82 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 1 May 1982, in front of a crowd of 92,147, and played , and scored a try in the 18-9 victory over Widnes in the 1982 Challenge Cup Final replay during the 1981‚Äì82 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Wednesday 19 May 1982, in front of a crowd of 41,171, and played in the 24-28 defeat by Wigan in the 1985 Challenge Cup Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 4 May 1985, in front of a crowd of 99,801, in what is regarded as the most marvellous cup final in living memory, which Hull narrowly lost after fighting back from 12-28 down at half-time. Kemble initially played for Hull alongside his future Kiwi assistant coach James Leuluai, and New Zealand Captain Dane O'Hara (from 1981) and they were later joined by another New Zealand Captain in Fred Ah Kuoi (from 1983). They were amongst the first large group of New Zealand rugby league players to play their professional rugby league in England and such was their subsequent commitment to the British game that in 1986 the British Government & Rugby Football League changed rules and by laws regarding overseas players to take those who had shown such commitment outside of the overseas player quotas. Kemble played in Hull FC's 18-7 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1982 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1982‚Äì83 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 2 October 1982, played in the 13-2 victory over Castleford in the 1983 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1983‚Äì84 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 15 October 1983, played , and scored 2-tries in the 29-12 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1984 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull on Saturday 27 October 1984, and played in the 24-31 defeat by Castleford in the 1986 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1986‚Äì87 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 11 October 1986. Kemble played in Hull FC's 0-12 defeat by Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1984‚Äì85 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull on Saturday 26 January 1985. He made 19 test appearances for the New Zealand national rugby league team and played 195 times for Hull F.C. (inc. 5 as sub), scoring 45 tries and 1 goal for 162 pointsHull FC 100 Greats by Raymond Fletcher, 1992 In 1986, as Hull F.C. had hit harder financial times, and had been forced to sell Lee Crooks to Leeds, Kemble and Hull F.C. were unable to agree new contract terms, and a good (non-Rugby) job having been offered to him back home. He was listed at ¬£40,000 with initial interest from Leeds in either a purchase or a short-term loan agreement (such as Leigh had agreed for James Leuluai the year before) and then further talk of him possibly returning from New Zealand to play for Salford in a swap deal for Paul Fletcher (who did subsequently join Hull F.C.) In the end it all came to nothing and Kemble's next return to Hull was 20 years later (alongside Dane, Fred, James and Australians Peter Sterling and John Muggleton) to reunite the 1985 challenge cup squad at a 21st anniversary dinner at Hull FC's KC stadium. After 5 great seasons with Hull FC, Gary Kemble therefore returned home to New Zealand subsequently establishing a successful coaching career. Coaching career Kemble coached the Northcote Tigers in 1993 before being appointed the coach of the Hawkes Bay Unicorns in the new Lion Red Cup. During 1995 World Cup he served as an assistant coach to the New Zealand national rugby league team. In April 1997 he was made the Auckland Warriors reserve grade coach, replacing Frank Endacott who had been appointed head coach. The team made the Grand Final but lost to the Bulldogs.Frank Endacott with John Coffey Being Frank:The Frank Endacott Story. Auckland, Hodder Moa Beckett, 2002. . During this time Kemble held a number of representative coaching posts, including the Junior Kiwis in 1994, then the New Zealand Residents and New Zealand \\"A\\" from 1995 to 1997. Kemble coached Counties Manukau in 2006. =Appointment to Kiwi coach= After several years working away from rugby league Kemble was named the coach of the Kiwis, filling the post left vacant by Brian McClennan in July 2007.Gary Kemble appointed new New Zealand coach NZRL Press Release, 17 August 2007 Kemble's appointment to the position of the Kiwi coach was controversial from the outset, in part through no fault of his own. First of all, the departure of Brian McClennan to coach the Leeds Rhinos was confusing given his unprecedented success and popularity amongst the Kiwi players and the New Zealand rugby league public as well as his expressed desire to remain in the role.McClennan quits to take Leeds deal ABC News, 11 July 2007 Preventing McClennan from remaining in the role was a controversial clause whereby the NZRL will not consider anyone living outside New Zealand for coaching the Kiwis. The NZRL were criticised severely for losing McClennan with rumours abound that he was \\"pushed\\" out of the role. Outspoken chairman Andrew Chalmers and Kemble's former coach Graham Lowe bore the brunt of public derision. Although Kemble had been an integral part of the New Zealand coaching structure for several years some questioned his credentials on the basis of his lack of experience coaching in a more rigorous competition such as Australasia's NRL or the Super League. However this argument was dismissed by the NZRL on the basis of the considerable success of Kemble's predecessor Brian McClennan who did come through the New Zealand coaching system to lead the Kiwis to victory in the 2005 Tri-Nations. =2007 Centenary Test vs Australia= Kemble's test coaching career got off to the worst possible start both on and off the field. On 14 October 2007 the Kiwis suffered their largest ever defeat in the Centenary Test losing 58‚Äì0 to the Kangaroos at Westpac Trust Stadium in Wellington. The evening following the test match a young woman claimed she was sexually violated by a group of men believed to be with the Kiwi side at the team hotel in Lower Hutt. The woman subsequently chose not to pursue the matter however several Kiwi players faced internal disciplinary action. =2007 Kiwi tour of Great Britain and France= Under Kemble the Kiwis went on to lose the first of their three test series against Great Britain going down 14‚Äì20 against the Lions at Huddersfield on 27 October 2007. Following the loss an Australian newspaper reported that former Kiwi captain Hugh McGahan was concerned at Kemble's poor start and suggested that Australian former and current Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett should be pursued for the role.New Zealand legend sends out SOS to Broncos coach Courier Mail, 29 October 2007 McGahan later claimed that his comments had been grossly misreported by the journalist. In the second test of the series on 3 November 2007, Kemble returned to Hull where he had spent a large portion of his playing days with Hull F.C. albeit to the newly built KC Stadium rather than The Boulevard where Hull FC played prior to it being built. It was to be a disastrous homecoming however as the Kiwis suffered their second humiliating defeat under Kemble when beaten 44‚Äì0 by an inspired Great Britain. The win gave Great Britain an unassailable series lead leaving the Kiwis with only pride to play for in the final test at JJB Stadium in Wigan. Intense criticism followed the 2nd Test loss, some of it directed at the players, some of it toward the management of the NZRL, however Kemble also copped severe criticism from some quarters with one commentator suggesting that Kemble \\"must be sacked at the series-end\\" and describing him as a \\"captain of calamity\\". Following the loss, Kiwi's captain Roy Asotasi hinted at the possibility of internal issues for the players in adjusting to Kemble's coaching style when he compared Kemble's approach with that of his predecessor McClennan describing them as \\"very different\\" and reporting that the group was \\"still trying to gel\\". Following the loss in an extremely frank admission Kemble acknowledged that he was contemplating resigning from his post if the Kiwis were whitewashed 3‚Äì0 by Great Britain. Despite a far more spirited performance in the 3rd Test the Kiwis were unable to prevent the whitewash losing 22‚Äì28 after leading 12‚Äì0 early in the match. Kemble was forthright in expressing his desire to remain Kiwi coach following the loss with the general feeling being that the loss was \\"close enough\\" for him to retain the position. Kemble was the subject of some ridicule for post-match comments which suggested that the Kiwis \\"almost won the test series\\" despite an aggregated score of 92‚Äì36 across the three tests. The Kiwis beat France in the final test match of the tour 22‚Äì16 giving captain Roy Asotasi his first win as Kiwi captain. =Resignation= On Saturday 18 January 2008, Gary Kemble resigned. Captain Roy Asotasi along with fellow Kiwi teammate David Kidwell had earlier expressed their concern publicly at the lack of respect they and other senior players held for the coach due to his inexperience at that level and deemed the 2008 World Cup already a failure if Kemble didn't receive some kind of help. Later years Kemble is the current head coach of the Papakura Sea Eagles in the Auckland Rugby League. Gary is now the manager of the Horsham downs golf club in Hamilton Personal life Gary Kemble is married to Stephanie and they have four sons. After his stint with the Auckland Warriors reserve grade side Kemble spent some time away from rugby league working in real estate for several years. Prior to his international rugby league career, Kemble was an up-and-coming cricketer. He played his club cricket as a Wicket- keeper for Papakura, and was part of the Northern Districts Under-23 cricket team that won the national title.

The name has become associated with a myth that the French continuously maintained a military garrison at a fort near the mouth of the Chicago River, and the future site of the city of Chicago on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan. Some sources mention that the fort was built in 1685, and that Henri de Tonti sent his aide, Pierre-Charles de Liette, as commander of the fort through 1702. Although this fort was marked on a number of eighteenth century maps of the area, there is no evidence that it ever existed at the described location, but may have instead actually been located at the mouth of the St. Joseph River, on the southeastern shore of Lake Michigan.  Background  Before the arrival of the French missionaries, the swampy area was inhabited by small settlements of Native Americans on the southern coast of Lake Michigan. Their community was made up of Algonquian people of the Mascoutens and Miamis tribes, which hunted the area. The French missionaries were the first Europeans to come into this region. The settlements of Algonquian people in the area were used as trading posts on the trade routes by the French fur traders and trappers. The word Ch√©cagou was probably coined from the French word shikaakwa, which means \\"wild leek\\" or \\"skunk weed\\". History =Seventeenth century settlement attempts= A number of small, temporary fortified trading posts were constructed in the area in the late seventeenth century. The exact location of most of these trading posts is uncertain, and, although they were sometimes referred to as \\"forts,\\" there is no evidence of a permanent French military fortification in the area during this period. Henri de Tonti In a letter written by the explorer de LaSalle dated June 4, 1683, he notes that two of his men had constructed a temporary stockade at the Chicago Portage in the winter of 1682. However, this structure was little more than a log cabin and was never garrisoned. In the winter of 1685, the French had built another temporary stockade in the area, the purported Fort Ch√©cagou. This fort was likely occupied for less than a year. In 1692, Henri de Tonti reportedly sent his aide, Pierre-Charles de Liette, to act as commander of the fort (through 1702). The earliest mention of a Fort of Chicagou located at the mouth of the Chicago River, appears in a memoir written by Henri de Tonti in 1693 in which he recounted an overland journey from Fort Michilimackinac to Fort St. Louis that he made during the winter of 1685/1686: However, an account of the same journey written by Tonty in the summer of 1686, makes no mention of the fort, and can be interpreted to suggest that the fort he visited was actually at the mouth of the St. Joseph River on the southeast side of Lake Michigan. Further evidence that Durantaye's fort was not located beside the Chicago River comes from the journals of Henri Joutel. In October 1687 Joutel, and a party of de LaSalle's men left Fort St. Louis bound for Canada. When they arrived at Lake Michigan, however, poor weather prevented them from going any further. After waiting for eight days by the lake at the mouth of the Chicago River, they gave up and returned to Fort St. Louis. They set out again in March 1688, arriving at Ch√©cagou on March 29, and leaving on April 8. Joutel described their stay in the area, but made no mention of any fort. The Mission of the Guardian Angel was built in 1696 by the French missionaries in order to facilitate the conversion to Christianity of the local Amerindians. =Area abandoned and reclaimed= In the early 1700s, the Potawatomis took over this region from the Mascoutens and the Miamis. The area (and any possible forts) was abandoned by the French in the 1720s during the Fox Wars. It was customary for the native peoples to burn down the Europeans' forts after their triumphs, unlike Europeans who would take over the fort and often rename it. The first known foreigner to permanently settle in the area was Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, who was a Haitian of African and French ancestry. In the 1770s, he settled on the banks of the Chicago River, and married a Potawatomi woman. Myth of a French Fort Ch√©cagou is born  The myth of a French fort at the mouth of the Chicago River emerged following the publication of a map of Lake Michigan by Louis Hennepin in 1698 (see map, above). His map showed Fort Miami near the mouth of the St. Joseph River, however, he showed the river as emerging from the southernmost tip of the lake. Hennepin's map was widely copied, but cartographers‚Äîknowing that there was no river at the southern tip of Lake Michigan‚Äîerroneously assumed that Hennepin had intended to show the Chicago River, and so it became widely accepted that there had been a French fort at the mouth of the Chicago River.

Symptoms may include abdominal bruising (seat belt sign), or less commonly paralysis of the legs. In around half of cases there is an associated abdominal injury such as a splenic rupture, small bowel injury, pancreatic injury, or mesenteric tear. Injury to the bowel may not be apparent in the first day. The cause is classically a head-on motor vehicle collision in which the affected person is wearing only a lap belt. Being hit in the abdomen with an object like a tree or a fall may also result in this fracture pattern. It often involves disruption of all three columns of the vertebral body (anterior, middle, and posterior). The most common area affected is the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. A CT scan is recommended as part of the diagnostic work-up to detect any potential abdominal injuries. The fracture is often unstable. Treatment may be conservative with the use of a brace or via surgery. The fracture is currently rare. It was first described by G. Q. Chance, a radiologist from Manchester, UK, in 1948. The fracture was more common in the 1950s and 1960s before shoulder harnesses became common. Mechanism In some Chance fractures there is a transverse break through the bony spinous process while in others there is a tear of the supraspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, interspinous ligament, and posterior longitudinal ligament. Diagnosis A flexion- distraction fracture of T10 and fracture of T9 due to a seatbelt during an MVC. On plain X-ray a Chance fracture may be suspected if two spinous processes are excessively far apart. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is recommended as part of the diagnostic work-up to detect any potential abdominal injuries. MRI may also be useful. The fracture is often unstable.

In United States, it is scheduled as a Schedule III drug in the Controlled Substance Act.  Effects  It produces lengthened sleep in functional nervous insomnia, and is also useful in insanity, being given with mucilage of acacia or in hot liquids, owing to its insolubility, or in large capsules. Its hypnotic power is not equal to that of chloral, but as it is not a depressant to the heart or respiration it can be used when morphine or chloral are contra-indicated. It is, however, very uncertain in its action, often failing to produce sleep when taken at bedtime, but producing drowsiness and sleep the following day. The drowsiness the next day following a medicinal dose can be avoided by a saline laxative the morning after its administration. It is unwise to use it continuously for more than a few days at a time, as it tends to produce the sulfonal habit, which is attended by marked toxic effects, disturbances of digestion, giddiness, staggering gait and even paralysis of the lower extremities. These effects are accompanied by skin eruptions, and the urine becomes of a dark red color (hematoporphinuria). Sulfonal is cumulative in its effects. Many fatal cases of sulfonal poisoning are on record, both from chronic poisoning and from a single large dose.  Chemistry  Sulfonal is prepared by condensing acetone with ethyl mercaptan in the presence of hydrochloric acid, the mercaptol (CH3)2C(SC2H5)2 formed being subsequently oxidized by potassium permanganate. It is also formed by the action of alcoholic potash and methyl iodide on ethylidene diethyl sulfine, CH3CH(SO2C2H5)2 (which is formed by the oxidation of dithioacetal with potassium permanganate). It crystallizes in prisms melting at 125 C, which are practically insoluble in cold water, but dissolve in 15 parts of hot and also in alcohol and ether.

The ship sank in Lake Superior just outside the harbor of Duluth, Minnesota, United States, on 7 June 1902, after a collision with the George Hadley. The wreck of the Thomas Wilson is one of the best remaining examples of a whaleback steamer, and it is also significant for the changes made in operating procedures at the Duluth harbor. The remains of the ship were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.  Ship  The whaleback was designed by Captain Alexander McDougall to carry cargoes of iron ore or grain economically around the Great Lakes. A pair of coal-fired Scotch boiler engines provided steam for the three-cylinder, triple expansion steam engine which drove a single screw propeller. The hull was built of heavy steel plates double-riveted to steel angle frames. The bow and stern were of a conoidal shape, with the center part of the hull being roughly cigar-shaped. The ship was long, with a beam and a hold. The hatches on the deck had no coamings, vertical sections that would have prevented water from coming into the hatches. Instead the hatches were designed to be flush with the surface of the deck, and were simply bolted to the deck.  Sinking  The Hadley after the collision On 7 June 1902, the Thomas Wilson left the Duluth harbor carrying a load of Mesabi iron ore. The hatches were not yet closed, because the weather was clear and calm. Meanwhile, the George Hadley, a 2073-ton wooden steamer, was inbound for the Duluth harbor. The Annie L. Smith tugboat directed the George Hadley to divert to the Superior harbor, since all of the Duluth coal docks were full. The captain of the George Hadley ordered an immediate turn to port without noticing the direction of the Thomas Wilson or blowing the required whistle signals. The captain of the Thomas Wilson, concerned about the movements of the Hadley but suspicious of running aground if he turned to port, ordered an immediate turn to starboard. The Hadley struck the Wilson just forward of the aft hatch and recoiled from the collision. The Wilson rolled over to port, then righted itself and began to sink by the bow. Within three minutes, the entire ship had sunk, drowning nine of the twenty-man crew. The ship and its cargo were valued at $207,000 (). As a result of the collision, new rules were instituted in the Duluth harbor: # Ships cannot leave the harbor with open hatches. # Ships may not pull out from another ship following a collision. # Pilots may not carry out any order given by the captain when another vessel is sighted without first calling the captain's attention to the other vessel. # All ships must be equipped with signal systems to all parts of the vessel to warn of danger.  The wreck today  The ship rests in of water less than a mile outside the entrance of the Duluth Ship Canal. The stern of the ship is substantially complete, though a large section of the hull of the midship has been broken apart due to other ships dragging anchors through the wreck. The interior of the ship has survived largely intact, with relatively few artifacts having been removed by divers. The wreck was listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the name Thomas Wilson (Whaleback Freighter) Shipwreck in 1992 for its state- level significance in the themes of engineering and maritime history.

The eighteenth named storm, ninth and final hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Rick was a short-lived Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale that weakened before making landfall in Mexico on November 10. It hit almost a month after the more powerful Hurricane Pauline made landfall in the same country. Most of the damage associated with Pauline was exacerbated by the weaker Rick, which struck during rebuilding efforts. Damage from Rick was fairly minor. As Rick was heading towards Mexico, the people on the coastline evacuated due to the impact of Pauline making them more prepared to deal with another hurricane, leading to no casualties. Meteorological history Hurricane Rick's ultimate origin was a tropical wave that left Africa on October 15. While crossing the Atlantic, the wave was mainly tracked by continuity due to its lack or organization. After entering the Pacific, part of it developed cloudiness on November 5 when it was south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Organization and a circulation developed, and satellite tracking began on November 6. The disturbance became better organized and formed into Tropical Depression Nineteen-E on November 7. At first moving northwest, the depression was turned north by a trough. Around noon on November 8, when it was about southwest of Acapulco, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Rick. The storm developed a cold central dense overcast, turned northeast, and became a hurricane on November 9. An eye appeared that day, accompanied by a well-center visible on Acapulco radar. The hurricane reached its peak intensity of and 973 mbar, making it a low-end Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; However, some sources disagree, saying that Rick was a Category 3 major hurricane at its peak. After weakening to , it made landfall on Oaxaca on November 10. Around the time of landfall, hurricane force winds extended and tropical storm force winds extended from the center, respectively. Rick continued to weaken while moving parallel to Mexico's coast along the Gulf of Tehuantepec before dissipating into a convectionless swirl of clouds over Chiapas on November 11. Preparations Hurricane Rick on November 9 near peak intensity. The pre- Rick tropical depression was a threat to Mexico. Hours before upgrading, Mexican officials issued a tropical storm watch for the area between L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Michoac√°n and Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Three hours before Rick was upgraded to a hurricane, the watch was upgraded to a warning and a hurricane watch was issued and shortly afterward raised to a warning. On November 9, the hurricane warning was extended to Zihuatanejo and Huatulco; warnings for areas west of Zihuatanejo and L√°zaro C√°rdenas were dropped at the same time. However, warnings for areas west of and including Acapulco remained until lifted three hours later. On November 10, warnings were extended from Punta Maldonado to Tapachula; all warnings west of Punta Maldonado were dropped at that time. Then, Mexico's Interior Ministry declared a state of emergency along the Oaxaca coast. Six hours later, the warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings. These warnings remained until they were dropped when Rick was downgraded to a depression. The people in the coastal areas, most of which were already affected by the more catastrophic Pauline a month ago, were ready for Rick. All major ports along the coast were closed ahead of time in preparation, as well as airports in Huatulco and Puerto Escondido where power failures occurred because of Hurricane Rick. One hundred and thirty Red Cross workers, including twenty that were based in Mexico, who were in the area in the aftermath of Pauline, kept in the area to handle the second hurricane. Many people from Puerto √Ångel, Huatulco, and Puerto Escondido (where National Operations Director Bernardino Heredia was overseeing recovery efforts) beach areas were evacuated. During the Puerto √Ångel evacuation, helicopters landed carrying soldier and rifles, which one tourist likened to a third-world revolution. In Chiapas, officials watched for flooding along the rivers and upstream river valleys, where the rains from three previous systems caused the ground to saturate and in the state capital of Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, families were evacuated due to rising rivers. Impact Rainfall map of the hurricane The damage from Rick was minor in comparison to Pauline. In Oaxaca, the hurricane was responsible for dumping of rain onto the state, which in turn resulted in mudslides and flash floods in areas earlier ravaged by Pauline. These rains also resulted in the sea level rising three feet above normal levels due to high waves generated during its passage. The hurricane was also responsible for rendering bridges and roads unpassable in the state, which had only recently been repaired after they were damaged by two prior hurricanes: 1995's Hurricane Roxanne in the Atlantic and Pauline, which had weakened bridges a month prior, allowing Rick to topple them, including a bridge near Puerto Escondido which left a deep gap in the road. Among the major roads that were cut off were a mountain road from Puerto Angel to Oaxaca City, a route used to link the coast with Mexico City, and a route from Puerto Escondido with Acapulco. A total of of rainfall, the highest total caused by Rick, was recorded in Astata/San Pedro Huameluca, which was near the point where the hurricane made landfall. Telephone communications and traffic were cut off to many villages in the wake of the hurricane. Although Rick was much weaker than Pauline, there were some areas where Rick's impact was greater than that of Pauline's. One such place was the village of El Tomatal, located southeast of Puerto Escondido. There, eight houses were destroyed and roofs were torn off of many others, which residents attributed to more rain than in Pauline, even though the winds were roughly equal. Although there were no casualties, the hurricane caused more than 2000 people to become homeless. Most of what Pauline had left behind was destroyed by Rick, which one resident said was like \\"Pauline came to harvest the corn, and Rick came to harvest the peanuts.\\" In the United States, Rick had a temporary economic impact when, during its time off the shore of Chiapas and Oaxaca, it caused the price of coffee to rise 4.7 percent to $1.5685 per pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the highest total it reached since October 16. Mexico is the United States's largest source of coffee imports and Oaxaca and Chiapas are the largest coffee growing regions in Mexico. Like the impact in El Tomatal, Rick's effects were much worse than Pauline's because Rick threatened the coffee crop when the beans were more susceptible to winds that could blow them off. Records Rick was one of only eight known hurricanes to form in the East Pacific in November. The others were Nina in 1957, Tara in 1961, Iwa in 1982, Nora in 1991, Sergio in 2006, Kenneth in 2011, and Sandra in 2015. Rick was the second one of these to make landfall, although it was the third weakest of them, just slightly stronger than Nina and Iwa (Tara's central pressure is unknown). Rick is also the second-latest hurricane in official records to have hit either coast of Mexico, behind only Tara.

He was a minor member of the generation after Josquin des Prez, and he also composed a notable lament on the more famous composer's death. Next to nothing is known about his life, except that he was the singing-master at Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe-op-de-rade, the guild at St. Baaf cathedral (formerly known as the Janskerk), in Ghent, in 1525 and 1526.Jas, Grove online That city was a prominent center of music- making throughout the Renaissance, and produced many famous composers and singers. St. Baaf Cathedral in Ghent. Vinders' music has both progressive features, such as the pervasive imitation which was to characterize the compositions of the generation of Gombert and Clemens non Papa, and unusually conservative elements, such as use of the cantus-firmus technique, which had been old-fashioned since around 1500 or even before. Sometimes he combined both the conservative and progressive elements together in the same work, such as in his mass based on the famous tune Fors seulement, which uses both cantus-firmus and parody together (parody technique was to be the favorite method of mass composition right up to the end of the century; it used many voices of a multi-voice model). Vinders wrote both sacred and secular music. All is polyphonic music for voices; no instrumental compositions have survived, or been attributed to him. Four masses survive, all for five voices; all use different kinds of sources. The Missa Fors seulement is built on the chansons by Antoine de F√©vin and Matthaeus Pipelare; the Missa Fit porta Christi pervia is based on a plainchant cantus firmus; the Missa Myns liefkens bruyn ooghen uses as its source a secular song in Dutch, by Benedictus Appenzeller; and the Missa Stabat mater uses the motet by Josquin, a composer he evidently admired. Eight of his motets survive, and they vary from four to seven voices; his famous O mors inevitabilis, a lament on the death of Josquin des Prez, is for seven. This is one of his most often recorded pieces in the present day, sometimes paired with Gombert's similar lament on Josquin's death, Musae Jovis; it has even been used as background music in a 2005 computer game, Civilization IV. The three known secular songs by Vinders, \\"Myns liefkens bruyn ooghen\\", \\"Och rat van aventueren\\", and \\"O wrede fortune\\", are all in Dutch, suggesting that this may have been his native language in bilingualWegman, Grove online: \\"As a major town in a northern-French county, Ghent has always been bilingual...\\" Ghent; many of the composers from that area wrote French chansons, but if Vinders did, none have survived. The secular pieces are for four to six voices. References * Jheronimus Vinders, Collected Works, ed. Eric Jas.

Centred at the top of the left column is the name \\"Peire dela Cauarana\\". Peire de la Caravana (also Cavarana, Gavarana, or C√† Varana, perhaps meaning \\"near Verona\\") was an Italian troubadour (trovatore) in Lombardy in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. He was one of the earliest Occitan troubadours in Italy. He is famous for his sirventes. Among his preserved works are the sirventes D'un serventes faire and La Paz de Costanza. Peire wrote the first encouraging the communes of northern Italy to resist German overlorship, which has been dated to as early as 1157.Scaglione, 176. However, Peire incites the Lombard cities by harkening back to the fate of the baronage of Apulia who had resisted the Germans earlier: > Lombart, beus gardaz > Que ja non siaz > Pejer que compraz, > Si ferm non estaz! > De Pulla'us sovegna > Dels valens baros > Qu'il non an que pegna > For de lor maisos; > Gardaz non devegna > Autretal de vos!Vigneras, 245. This has led some to date it to 1194, when Henry VI conquered Sicily or as late as 1225, when the city-states of northern Italy renewed the old Lombard League in opposition to Henry's son, Frederick I of Sicily, Holy Roman Emperor. Writing in Lombardy in the Occitan tongue under the nominal sovereignty of the German monarch, Peire took the opportunity to poke fun at the German language, writing in a famously debated passage: > Granoglas resembla [la gent d'Alemanha] > En dir(e): Broder, guaz; > Lairan, quant s'asembla > Cum cans enrabjaz.Spitzer, 71. > > Frogs resemble [the people of Germany] > In saying: Brother, watz! > The sound of which as much resembles > Dogs barking. The German word \\"watz\\" is said to be an interjection resembling the clinking of glasses and proposes a toast. Peire also had ties to Sardinia. He dedicated his D'un serventes faire to a senhal Malgrat de toz, which has been identified as Barisone II of Arborea, who was crowned King of Sardinia at Pavia by the Emperor Frederick I in return for 4,000 silver marks from Genoa, but was later deposed. Peire later had contact with the cultured Judge of Cagliari, Salusio IV. Sources *Scaglione, Aldo.

He earned six caps with the U.S. national team between 1954 and 1957. He was a member of the U.S. Olympic soccer team at the 1956 Summer Olympics. Club career Wecke grew up in St. Louis, Missouri where he graduated from Cleveland High School in 1945. While in high school, he played for the Schumacher juniors. The nature of team sponsorship in St. Louis during the 1940s and 1950s make it seem as if Wecke jumped between teams during his career. He actually only played for two teams; however, sponsorship changes led to several team name changes. In 1948, he turned professional with Paul Schulte Motors which became McMahon Pontiac for the 1949-1950 St. Louis Major League season. In April 1950, he jumped to Zenthoefer Furs which had been hit with several injuries as it prepared for a National Amateur Cup game. The team won the 1950, St. Louis Major League title. He then returned to his original team, now known as the St. Louis Raiders, for the 1951-1952. When Tom Kutis began sponsoring the team in 1953, the team was renamed St. Louis Kutis S.C. and Wecke remained with it until 1960. He was part of the Kutis team which won the 1957 National Challenge Cup and five consecutive National Amateur Cups from 1956 to 1960. National and Olympic team Wecke was a mainstay of the U.S. national team, playing all seven U.S. games from April 3, 1954 through the end of 1957. On April 3 and 4, 1954, the U.S. defeated Haiti in two qualification matches for the 1954 FIFA World Cup. However, by the time the U.S. played these two games, it had already been eliminated due to earlier loses to Mexico. Wecke played the only U.S. game in 1955, a 3-2 loss to Iceland. He then played in all four of the U.S. games in 1957. While the national team was idle in 1956, Wecke was not. He was part of the U.S. soccer team at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. In the games, the U.S. lost to Yugoslavia in the first round of the single elimination tournament. In 1959, Wecke played on the U.S. soccer team at the 1959 Pan American games. The U.S. took the bronze medal in those games. Wecke was inducted into the St. Louis Soccer Hall of Fame on October 26, 1983. Family Herman was the husband of Joan Allen, married on October 6, 1951. He was the father of Richard, who played for Benedictine College, Matthew who played at Forest Park CC and Southeast Missouri State and Christopher who played at Southeast Missouri State University. He had five grandchildren and one great grandchild. His father, Herman Wecke, was a long-time sportswriter for the St. Louis Post Dispatch and the St. Louis Cardinals official scorer in the 1926 World Series.

The entire length of the highway has been designated the Indian Creek Corridor Scenic Byway. Route 211 runs west to Photograph Gap US 191 & Utah Route 211 Markers Route description The highway begins near Church Rock, a notable rock formation along U.S. Route 191 between Moab and Monticello. It runs past the ruins of the utopian religious community called Home of Truth, and through Photograph Gap. The highway then descends Indian Canyon. Once exiting the canyon the highway passes by Newspaper Rock, directly off the shoulder of the highway. The highway also passes by Six-Shooter Peak, a notable peak near the entrance to Canyonlands National Park. The highway ends at Dugout Ranch just shy of the National Park boundary. The descent down Indian Canyon between US-191 and Newspaper Rock features a steep descent and sharp curves. As a result, the Utah Department of Transportation mandates that all vehicles using Route 211 that exceed in width or in length have an accompanying pilot car escort.

The school was part of the last junior high system in the state of North Carolina which was replaced by the standard middle school model in the 2015‚Äì2016 school year. Before being incorporated as an elementary school, Nebo was a high school. Part of the high school burnt down years ago but the lunch room remained.  Location  The heart of Nebo is considered to be at the Nebo post office (28761). However, in recent times, Nebo has extended into Burke County due to new construction on Lake James. Some residents consider themselves to live in Nebo but reside just inside Burke County. This, however, is highly debatable, as the majority of residents of Nebo consider the boundary of Nebo to only cover the land area protected by the Nebo Volunteer Fire Department.

History http://www.securities- administrators.ca/aboutcsa.aspx?id=77 As an informal body, the CSA functions through meetings, conference calls and day to day cooperation among the securities regulatory authorities. In 2003, the CSA was re-structured into a more formal organization. The Chair and Vice-Chair are elected by members for two year terms. In 2004, the CSA established a permanent secretariat, located in Montreal. In recent years, the CSA has developed the \\"passport system\\" through which a market participant has access to markets in all passport jurisdictions by dealing only with its principal regulator and complying with one set of harmonized laws. While the CSA co-ordinates initiatives on a cross- Canada basis, the 10 provinces and 3 territories in Canada are responsible for securities regulations and their enforcement. This provides a more direct and efficient service since each regulator is closer to its local investors and market participants. Structure http://www.securities- administrators.ca/aboutcsa.aspx?id=92 = Members = The CSA consists of securities regulators of the 10 provinces and 3 territories of Canada : :Alberta Securities Commission :British Columbia Securities Commission :Manitoba Securities Commission :New Brunswick's Financial and Consumer Services Commission :Newfoundland and Labrador's Office of the Superintendent of Securities of the Service :Nova Scotia Securities Commission :Ontario Securities Commission :Prince Edward Island's Office of the Superintendent of Securities :Qu√©bec's Autorit√© des march√©s financiers :Saskatchewan's Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority :Northwest Territories Securities Office :Nunavut Securities Office :Yukon Territories' Office of the Superintendent of Securities = Chairs = The CSA Chairs are the chairs of the securities regulators of the 10 provinces and 3 territories of Canada. They meet quarterly in person. A Chair and Vice-Chair of the CSA are elected by members for two year terms. = Policy Coordination Committee = The CSA established the Policy Coordination Committee in August 2003. Its members are the Chairs of eight regulators (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Qu√©bec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia). The Policy Coordination Committee acts as a forum for timely resolution of policy development issues, monitors ongoing issues and provides recommendations to the CSA Chairs for their resolution. = Secretariat = The CSA established a permanent Secretariat in March 2004 in Montreal to provide the organizational stability necessary for CSA to function efficiently. The CSA Secretariat also monitors and coordinates the work of various CSA committees on policy initiatives. = IT Systems Office = The CSA IT Systems Office manages the day-to-day operations, maintenance, and enhancement of the CSA's national systems (SEDAR, SEDI, and NRD). Mission of the CSA http://www.securities- administrators.ca/our-mission.aspx = Harmonization of Securities Regulations = The CSA brings provincial and territorial securities regulators together to share ideas and work at designing policies and regulations that are consistent across the country and ensure the smooth operation of Canada's securities industry. By collaborating on rules, regulations and other programs, the CSA helps avoid duplication of work and streamlines the regulatory process for companies seeking to raise investment capital and others working in the investment industry. As a result of the coordination efforts of the CSA, securities markets are governed by harmonized national or multi-lateral instruments which are assigned uniform five-digit numbers, starting with a number that represents one of the nine subject matter categories: :# Procedure and Related Matters :# Certain Capital Market Participants :# Registration Requirements and Related Matters :# Distribution Requirements :# Ongoing Requirements for Issuers and Insiders :# Takeover Bids and Special Transactions :# Securities Transactions Outside the Jurisdiction :# Investment Funds :# Derivatives = The Passport System = In recent years, the CSA has developed the \\"passport system\\" - a regulatory system that gives a market participant automatic access to the capital markets in all Canadian jurisdictions except Ontario by registering with its principal regulator and meeting the requirements of one set of harmonized laws. The participants of the passport system are governments of all Canadian provinces and territories, except Ontario. The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) makes its own decisions but generally relies on the review by the principal regulator. To achieve maximum efficiency for the benefit of the market, the passport regulators accept the OSC's decisions under passport. = CSA Disclosure Systems = The CSA maintains several databases that contain information on public companies' disclosure and insider reporting (SEDAR, SEDI, and the XBRL Filing Program within SEDAR), the registration of dealers and advisers (NRD) and a cease trade order database (CTO). * SEDAR, the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval,http://www.sedar.com/sedar/sedar_en.htm is the system that public companies and investment funds use to file public securities documents and information with the CSA.  SEDI, the System for Electronic Disclosure by Insiders, is Canada's on-line, browser-based service for the filing and viewing of insider trading reports as required by various provincial securities rules and regulations.  NRD, the National Registration Database, is a web-based system that permits dealers and advisers to file registration forms electronically. The national registration search (NRS) contains the names of all registrants (individuals and firms) in Canada.  CTO, the cease trade order publicly searchable database, contains all orders issued by participating CSA members, regardless of whether their effect is temporary or indefinite, and disseminates such orders to CTO subscribers. = Investor Education = The CSA's impact on most Canadians comes through its efforts to help educate Canadians about the securities industry, the stock markets and how to protect investors from investment scams. The CSA provides a wide variety of educational materials on securities and investing. It has produced brochures and booklets explaining various topics such as how to choose a financial adviser, mutual funds, and investing via the internet. The CSA coordinates various annual investor education initiatives, including the Financial Literacy Month in November and the Fraud Prevention Month in March.  CSA Communications and Public Information Tools  The CSA publishes on its website a wide range of communications and public information tools, including news releases regarding newly adopted or proposed national or multilateral rules and regulations, investor education materials, enforcement reports and materials and investor research studies. = Annual Enforcement Report = In enforcement matters, while most enforcement activity is conducted locally, CSA members also coordinate multi-jurisdictional investigations and share tools and techniques that help their staff investigate and prosecute securities law violations that cross borders. Every year, the CSA publishes on its website an Enforcement Report, which provides an overview of enforcement actions taken by CSA members in such broad categories as fraud, illegal distribution, misconduct by registrants, illegal insider trading, disclosure violations and market manipulation. = Investor Alerts = The CSA maintains on its website a non-exhaustive list of CSA member investor alerts to assist the public and the securities industry in conducting due diligence.

The term's origin and usage arose in America during the late 19th century with the passing of the Page Act of 1875 which radically lowered immigration of Chinese women. Inspired by the characters played by actress Anna May Wong, the term comes from the female villain in the comic strip Terry and the Pirates. It has since been applied to powerful Asian women and to a number of racially Asian film actresses. The stereotype has generated a large quantity of sociological literature. \\"Dragon Lady\\" is sometimes applied to persons who lived before the term became part of American slang in the 1930s. It is also used to refer to any powerful but prickly woman, usually in a derogatory fashion. Background Anna May Wong as the daughter of Fu Manchu in Daughter of the Dragon (1931) Although sources such as the Oxford English Dictionary list uses of \\"dragon\\" and even \\"dragoness\\" from the 18th and 19th centuries to indicate a fierce and aggressive woman, there does not appear to be any use in English of \\"Dragon Lady\\" before its introduction by Milton Caniff in his comic strip Terry and the Pirates. The character first appeared on December 16, 1934, and the \\"Dragon Lady\\" appellation was first used on January 6, 1935. The term does not appear in earlier \\"Yellow Peril\\" fiction such as the Fu Manchu series by Sax Rohmer or in the works of Matthew Phipps Shiel such as The Yellow Danger (1898) or The Dragon (1913). However, a 1931 film based on Rohmer‚Äôs The Daughter of Fu Manchu, titled Daughter of the Dragon, is thought to have been partly the inspiration for the Caniff cartoon name. Terry and the Pirates Terry and the Pirates was an action-adventure comic strip created by cartoonist Milton Caniff. Joseph Patterson, editor for the Chicago Tribune New York Daily News syndicate, hired Caniff to create the new strip, providing Caniff with the idea of setting the strip in the Orient. A profile of Caniff in Time recounts the episode: : Patterson... asked: \\"Ever do anything on the Orient?\\" Caniff hadn't. \\"You know,\\" Joe Patterson mused, \\"adventure can still happen out there. There could be a beautiful lady pirate, the kind men fall for.\\" In a few days Caniff was back with samples and 50 proposed titles; Patterson circled Terry and scribbled beside it and the Pirates.\\"Escape Artist\\", Time, Monday, January 13, 1947. Caniff's biographer R. C. Harvey suggests that Patterson had been reading about women pirates in one of two books (or both) published a short time earlier: I Sailed with Chinese Pirates by Aleko Lilius and Vampires of the Chinese Coast by Bok (pseudonym for unknown). Women pirates in the South China Sea figure in both books, especially the one by Lilius, a portion of which is dedicated to the mysterious and real-life \\"queen of the pirates\\" (Lilius‚Äô phrase), named Lai Choi San (). \\"Lai Choi San\\" is a transliteration from Cantonese, the native language of the woman, herself‚Äîthus, the way she pronounced her own name. Caniff appropriated the Chinese name, Lai Choi San, as the \\"real name\\" of his Dragon Lady, a fact that led both Lilius and Bok to protest. Patterson pointed out that both books claimed to be non-fiction and that the name belonged to a real person; thus, neither the fact of a woman pirate nor her name could be copyrighted. (Neither Bok nor Lilius had used the actual term \\"Dragon Lady.\\") Sources are not clear on whether it was Patterson or Caniff who coined that actual term, though it was almost certainly one of the two.  Page Act of 1875  The Page Act of 1875 limited the amount of Chinese women allowed to immigrate into the United States, barring women from China, Japan, or any other Asian origin to enter the USA. This was a part of the Yellow Peril movement. That later became the Chinese Exclusion Act that prevented Chinese laborers from entering the USA from 1882 until it was repealed in 1943. It was thought that Chinese women bring prostitution. The Page Act was intended to control the Chinese American population. In the early twentieth century, most Chinese women in America were treated as prostitutes. This bled into American mainstream media, using the promiscuous image of the Dragon Lady as a way to alienate Asian American women; they were sex objects to be exploited but not good enough to be American wives. Usage Actress Anna May Wong Since the 1930s, when \\"Dragon Lady\\" became fixed in the English language, the term has been applied countless times to powerful Asian women, such as Soong Mei-ling, also known as Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Madame Nhu of Vietnam, Devika Rani of India, and to any number of racially Asian film actresses. That stereotype‚Äîas is the case with other racial caricatures‚Äîhas generated a large quantity of sociological literature. Today, \\"Dragon Lady\\" is often applied anachronistically to refer to persons who lived before the term became part of American slang in the 1930s. For example, one finds the term in recent works about the \\"Dragon Lady\\" Empress Dowager Cixi (Empress Dowager Tzu-hsi; ), who was alive at the turn of the 20th century, or references to Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong as having started her career in the 1920s and early 1930s in \\"Dragon Lady\\" roles. In both these cases, however, articles written in the early 1900s about the Empress Dowager or reviews of Wong‚Äôs early films such as The Thief of Bagdad (1924) or Daughter of the Dragon (1931)‚Äîreviews written when the films appeared‚Äîmake no use of the term \\"Dragon Lady\\".For example, the review of Daughter of the Dragon\\" in The New York Times, August 22, 1931. (One writer, however, did refer to the Empress Dowager as \\"a little lady Bismarck.\\")Bigelow, Poultney. \\"A New View of the Empress Dowager of China; Tsu Hsi, the Little Woman Who Rules the Celestial Empire and its Three Hundred Millions of People\\". The New York Times. June 26, 1904. Today‚Äôs anachronistic use of \\"Dragon Lady\\" in such cases may lead the modern reader to assume that the term was in earlier use than appears to be the case. Anna May Wong was the contemporary actress to assume the Dragon Lady role in American Cinema in the movie ‚ÄúDaughter of the Dragon,‚Äù which premiered in 1931. Josef von Sternberg's 1941 The Shanghai Gesture contains a performance by Ona Munson as 'Mother' Gin Sling, the proprietor of a gambling house, that bears mention within presentations of the genre. Other examples include Nancy Kwan in the film China Doll, and Michelle Yeoh in ‚ÄúTomorrow Never Dies is a more contemporary example. These actresses portrayed characters whose actions are more masculine, sexually promiscuous, and violent. Lucy Liu is a 21st century example of the Hollywood use of the Dragon Lady image, in her roles in Charlie‚Äôs Angels, Kill Bill, and Payback. Other American films in which Asian women are hyper-sexualized include The Thief of Baghdad, The Good Woman of Bangkok, and 101 Asian Debutantes, where Asian women are portrayed as prostitutes. Miss Saigon, is an American musical with examples of this as well. Another example of its usage is in the popular sci-fi film Avatar, where Corporal Jake Sully refers to his eventual mother-in-law Mo'at, high priestess of the Omaticaya Na'vi clan of Pandora, as Dragon lady while speaking about her to his boss Dr. Grace Augustine. This follows his first meeting with Mo'at, during which she successfully cows all of her fellow Omaticayas, including her husband the chieftain, into submitting to her wishes for Sully when prior to her arrival they had clearly all been resolved to kill him for trespassing on their land. In the 2008 film Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski uses the term in directing his Hmong neighbor to get him another beer.  Hollywood costuming  Nancy Kwan's Costume in The World of Suzie Wong Dragon Lady characters are visually defined by their emphasis on ‚Äúotherness‚Äù and sexual promiscuity. An example of headwear for Dragon Lady costumes is the Hakka hat or other headdresses with eastern inspiration. For body wear, traditionally Dragon Ladies have been put in sexualized renditions of the Cheongsam. Examples of this in The World of Susie Wong include Nancy Kwan‚Äôs character in cheongsam that accentuates her hips and breasts.

The reaction is named after its inventors, Raymond Urgel Lemieux and William Summer Johnson, who published it in 1956. The reaction proceeds in a two step manner, beginning with dihydroxylation of the alkene by osmium tetroxide, followed by a Malaprade reaction to cleave the diol using periodate. Excess periodate is used to regenerate the osmium tetroxide, allowing it to be used in catalytic amounts. The Lemieux‚ÄìJohnson reaction ceases at the aldehyde stage of oxidation and therefore produces the same results as ozonolysis. :600px The classical Lemieux‚ÄìJohnson oxidation often generates many side products, resulting in low reaction yields; however the addition of non-nucleophilic bases, such as 2,6-lutidine, can improve on this. OsO4 may be replaced with a number of other Osmium compounds. Periodate may also be replaced with other oxidising agents, such as oxone. History The development of the Lemieux‚ÄìJohnson oxidation was preceded by an analogous process, developed by Lemieux, which used an aqueous solution of sodium periodate with a low (catalytic) concentration of potassium permanganate. This mixture became known as Lemieux reagent and has been used to determine the position of double bonds and for preparing carbonyl compounds. Unlike the Lemieux‚ÄìJohnson oxidation, which normally stops at the aldehyde, this older method could continue to give a mixture of aldehydes and carboxylic acids.

It is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC). History The Master's Seminary was founded in the fall of 1986 under the leadership of John F. MacArthur. In the early 1990s, the seminary experienced substantial growth. In March 1998, the seminary completed construction of its own facility on the church campus. The 32,000 square foot building houses the seminary administrative and faculty offices, library, studio facilities, and smaller class and seminar rooms. The Master's Seminary first received WASC accreditation in 1988. The seminary is organized around five degree programs: Master of Divinity, Master of Theology (added in 1992), Doctor of Philosophy (added in 2000, originally as a Doctor of Theology), Doctor of Ministry in Expository Preaching (added in 2004), and a Spanish-language Master of Biblical Ministry (added in 2017). The last four programs were added after a process of substantive change and subsequent WSCUC approval. The Master's University (TMU) began as Los Angeles Baptist Theological Seminary in 1927. In 1959, the campus relocated to Newhall, CA. In the 1950s, an undergraduate program was developed. During the process of acquiring accreditation from WASC in the early 1970s, it was decided that the original seminary would separate and relocate (becoming Northwest Baptist Seminary in Tacoma, WA). The college remained and became Los Angeles Baptist College. After MacArthur became president of the college in 1985, the name of the school was changed to The Master's College. The central college campus remains in Newhall (now incorporated as the city of Santa Clarita, California), while TMS has been located on the church campus from its beginning. Accreditation As of July 18, 2018, The Master's University and Seminary was placed under probation by its accrediting institution, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC). The Commission Action Letter identified four main issues needing to be addressed, under the following headings: Board Independence, Personnel and Management Practices, Operational Integrity, and Leadership. The institution remained on probation after a subsequent visit from a WSCUC special visit team in fall 2018. In March 2019, president MacArthur issued a statement explaining that, in his view, WSCUC's primary concern was to see that ‚Äúthe TMUS Board is operating independently by maintaining an orderly transition to inaugurate a new President.‚Äù That statement also expressed the institution's intention to \\"complete all compliance issues fully.\\" In June 2019, Dr. MacArthur retired from serving as the president, and transitioned into the role of chancellor emeritus, in keeping with an announcement made in October 2018. Doctrine Theologically, The Master's Seminary is conservative and fundamentalist, affirming biblical inerrancy, a Reformed view of soteriology, and a Dispensational, premillennial position in eschatology. They have a thorough doctrinal statement, which covers the major aspects of their beliefs in a systematic fashion. The belief system is incorporated in the instructional tenets of their programs, emphasizing intense study of the Biblical languages in preparation for expository preaching. In 2017, the seminary faculty worked with John F. MacArthur and Richard L. Mayhue to produce a volume of systematic theology entitled, Biblical Doctrine: A Systematic Summary of Bible Truth. The Master's Seminary Library The seminary library began in 1986 with 7,000 volumes. The collection has been built into a major biblical and theological studies collection of over 350,000 volumes. The library collection is available online through the Voyager and Primo Systems of Ex Libris. The library provides access to a wide variety of research databases including ATLA, Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG)], Early American Imprints, Ad Fontes LIbrary of Classic Protestant Texts, and others. The Master's Seminary library was one of the founding libraries of the Southern California Theological Library Association (SCATLA). The Master's Seminary Journal Begun in 1990, The Master's Seminary Journal () is a publication of the faculty of The Master's Seminary. It is published semi- annually and contains articles dealing with the Biblical text, theology, and issues related to pastoral ministry. It also contains reviews of current books and significant articles relating to these issues. The Master's Seminary Journal (MSJ) is indexed and abstracted in all of the leading research tools including: Elenchus Bibliographicus Biblicus of Biblica, Christian Periodical Index, Guide to Social Science & Religion in Periodical Literature, New Testament Abstracts, Old Testament Abstracts. It is also indexed in the ATLA (American Theological Library Association) Religion Database and it is also included in the full-text ATLASerials.

Plank is still credited as a composer together with Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius on all tracks. Cluster II was recorded at Star- Studio in Hamburg, Germany in January 1972.

In 51 pitching appearances (32 starts), Robertson posted a win‚Äìloss record of 16‚Äì12 with a 5.71 earned run average and 111 strikeouts in 184‚Öì innings of work. Robertson attended Exeter High School before being drafted by the Astros in 1995. He spent the next seven years moving up the minor league system before making his debut in September 2002. His most productive year was 2003, where he won 15 games and finished seventh in Rookie of the Year voting. He was traded to the Indians the following year, where he played in eight games before being demoted to the minor leagues. Robertson spent the next few years playing in various Minor League and independent baseball organizations, including the Mexican League, Chinese Professional Baseball League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.  Early life  Robertson attended Exeter High School in his hometown of Exeter, California, where he was a standout on the high school baseball team for three seasons.  Career  =High school= During Robertson's senior year at Exeter High School, he played in the outfield and first base when he wasn't pitching. He finished the season with a .427 batting average and 24 runs batted in (RBI), as well as a win‚Äìloss record of 9‚Äì1 and an ERA of 0.95. For his efforts, he was named player of the year by The Fresno Bee and named to the All-State baseball team. The Houston Astros selected Robertson in the 24th round of the 1995 Major League Baseball draft, and he signed a contract with them on August 22, 1995. =Minor league = Robertson started his professional baseball career the following season, in 1996. He spent most of the season with the Gulf Coast League Astros, the rookie-class Astros franchise, where he played alongside future teammate Wade Miller. He also played one game with the Kissimmee Cobras. In 13 pitching appearances with the Astros, all of them starts, Robertson had a record of 5‚Äì3, a 1.72 ERA, and 98 strikeouts. For the 1997 season, Robertson was promoted to the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Midwest League. In 26 games for the River Bandits, Robertson had a record of 10‚Äì7, 135 strikeouts, and an ERA of 4.07. The Astros promoted Robertson in 1998 to the class-A advanced affiliate Kissimmee Cobras of the Florida State League. In 28 games with the Cobras, Robertson pitched 175 total innings. He also had a 10‚Äì10 record, a 3.71 ERA, and 131 strikeouts. He was again promoted the following year to the Jackson Generals of the Texas League. At one point during the season, he went six weeks without earning a victory. He rebounded from the drought and finished the season with a 15‚Äì7 record and a 3.06 ERA; his 15 wins led all pitchers in the league. After the season ended, the Houston Astros purchased his contract, effectively placing him on the 40-man roster. Robertson did not play a game for the Astros during the 2000 season, and instead split his season between Kissimmee, the AAA-class New Orleans Zephyrs, and Jackson; the team was renamed to the Round Rock Express that season. He spent most of his time with the Express, where he was dubbed a \\"superprospect\\" during his time there. He won 5 games and lost 10 in 25 combined pitching appearances between the three clubs that year. Robertson spent the entire 2001 season with the Express; it was the only season of his professional career where he was used solely as a relief pitcher. In 57 appearances totaling just under 75 innings, he had a 5‚Äì1 record and a 3.91 ERA. He was promoted to the Zephyrs for most of the 2002 season, and while he was told he would continue his relief work, he impressed management enough to move back into the starting rotation before the season began. In 27 starts for the Zephyrs, Robertson had a 12‚Äì8 record, a league-leading 2.55 ERA, and 114 strikeouts en route to being named the Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Year. After the minor league season wrapped up at the end of August, the Astros purchased his contract and placed him on the major league roster. =Major League Baseball= Robertson made his MLB debut on September 2, 2002 against the Texas Rangers. He was starting in place of Roy Oswalt, who was serving a suspension for hitting a batter with a pitch. He allowed two runs in 2‚Öî innings and got the loss in his only start that year. He got his second decision in a 5‚Äì2 loss to the San Francisco Giants on September 28. In the game, the Giants clinched a playoff spot, and Barry Bonds hit a home run off Robertson into McCovey Cove to seal the game for them. He finished the season with a 6.52 ERA in 9‚Öî innings pitched. As the 2003 season began, Robertson was competing alongside Brad Lidge, Kirk Saarloos, and Pete Munro for the final spot in the Astros' starting rotation. He pitched the entire month of spring training, and when the season began he was granted the final spot in the rotation. Robertson made his season debut on April 3, and allowed eight earned runs in 4‚Öì innings, losing the match against the Colorado Rockies 10‚Äì5. He got his first career victory on April 10, allowing two hits in seven innings in a 4‚Äì2 victory against the Cincinnati Reds. He struggled in his next three starts, and by the end of April Robertson had a 1‚Äì3 record and an ERA of 7.99, which caused manager Jimy Williams to consider moving him back to the bullpen. After a May 2 matchup against the Atlanta Braves further increased his ERA, Robertson was demoted to the minor leagues, but only played with the Zephyrs for one game before being placed back on the major league roster ten days later. In a May 22 matchup against the St. Louis Cardinals, Robertson allowed one run and four hits in a 5‚Äì2 victory; after the game, catcher Gregg Zaun said that it was \\"absolutely the best he's thrown.\\" After the win against the Cardinals, Robertson won his next two starts, then he had three more matchups with a no-decision. Robertson continued to win games over the following months, and on July 22, he won a match against the Pittsburgh Pirates, 2‚Äì0. In the game, Robertson allowed three hits in what was his ninth victory in a row without a loss, as well as his sixth victory in his past six starts for Houston. His streak ended on July 27, as he only lasted 1‚Öî innings in a 5‚Äì3 loss to the Chicago Cubs in what was at the time the shortest start of his major league career. A month later, Robertson broke the team record for most victories by a left-handed rookie pitcher when he notched his 13th win against the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 2. His last start of the season on September 26, however, was his worst; he only pitched a third of an inning, allowed three earned runs, and threw 7 of 18 pitches for strikes as the Milwaukee Brewers won, 12‚Äì5. Robertson finished the 2003 season with 15 victories, 9 losses, a 5.10 ERA, and 99 strikeouts. He also finished in seventh place for the Rookie of the Year Award. Before the 2004 season began, the Houston Astros signed Andy Pettitte to boost their starting rotation. As a result, Robertson found himself battling with Tim Redding, Jared Fernandez, Carlos Hern√°ndez and Brandon Duckworth for the final spot in the rotation. After Roger Clemens was signed as well, the Astros decided before spring training began that Robertson would pitch out of the bullpen for the season. By the end of spring training, Robertson failed to crack the bullpen, and was to be demoted to the Zephyrs. On March 31, just before the season started, the Astros traded Robertson to the Cleveland Indians for Luke Scott and Willy Taveras. Robertson originally pitched for the Buffalo Bisons, the Indians' AAA-class affiliate in the minor leagues. He played with them for the first three months of the season, with the exception of one game on April 20 against the Kansas City Royals. In 14 appearances with Buffalo, 12 of them starts, Robertson had a 4‚Äì5 record with a 7.27 ERA. The Indians called Robertson up to the major league roster on June 25 after placing Rafael Betancourt on the disabled list. In eight games for the Indians, Robertson had a record of 1‚Äì1 and a 12.21 ERA. In his final appearance in the major leagues, a July 21 game against the Chicago White Sox, Robertson was ejected after hitting Magglio Ord√≥√±ez with a pitch in the fifth inning. After being demoted back to Buffalo, the Indians traded Robertson on August 3 to the Montreal Expos for Pierre-Luc Marceau. He pitched in seven games for the Edmonton Trappers to end the season, finishing with a 1‚Äì3 record and a 5.73 ERA. He was on the Expos' 40-man roster for September, but did not play a game for them, and in October he was removed from the roster. In November, the Cincinnati Reds signed him to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. During spring training in 2005, Robertson competed with Aaron Harang, Brandon Claussen, Luke Hudson, and Josh Hancock for two spots in the Reds' rotation. At the end of spring training, he was assigned to the Reds' minor league squad, the Louisville Bats. Robertson spent the season there, pitching in 28 games, 18 of them starts, and ended the year with a 5‚Äì11 record and a 5.46 ERA. After the season ended, Robertson was released, becoming a free agent. In March 2006, Robertson signed with the Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League. He pitched in two games for them, then on May 10 his contract was sold to the New York Mets. He spent the next couple months pitching for the Mets' minor league team, the Norfolk Tides, where he pitched in 11 games, finishing with a 1‚Äì6 record and a 7.68 ERA. After being released from the Mets, Robertson spent the rest of the season pitching for the Uni-President Lions of the Chinese Professional Baseball League. Robertson re-signed with the Newark Bears in 2007. For the season, he pitched in 14 games and went 5‚Äì5 with a 4.89 ERA. At the end of June, the Bears sold Robertson's contract to the Rieleros de Aguascalientes of the Mexican League. After a month there, in which he pitched four games, going 1‚Äì3 with a 5.54 ERA, he returned to Newark to finish the season with the Bears, in what was his last professional baseball appearance.  Personal life  Robertson had two sons. Robertson lived in Exeter, California. On May 29, 2010, Robertson died in Exeter, California after losing control of his motorcycle. Robertson was taking a turn on his motorcycle at an estimated 70 mph when he lost control of his bike.

Moran and Allen Newell who first described GOMS in their 1983 book The Psychology of Human Computer Interaction. Overview This technique requires a strict goal-method- operation-selection rules structure. The structure is rigid enough that the evaluator represents the tasks in a pseudo-code format (no formal syntax is dictated). It also provides a guide for how to formulate selection rules. This method can also be used to estimate the load the task places on the user. For instance, examining the number of levels down the task-tree that a goal branch is can be used to estimate the memory demand the task places on the system. The process must remember information about all of the levels above the current branch. This technique is more flexible than the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) because the pseudo-code is in a general form. That is, it can be executed for different scenarios by going down different branches, while KLM's procedure is a simple list that has to be recreated for each different task.

Edwards (April 11, 1914 ‚Äì August 25, 1971), nicknamed \\"Cowboy\\" and \\"Lefty\\", was one of the greatest basketball players of his era. He was an NCAA All-American at the University of Kentucky and also one of the most lauded professional players in the United States' National Basketball League's history. High school Edwards was a center who starred at Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis, Indiana. Back then, he was known as the \\"East Side Terror\\", and it was between his sophomore and junior years that he learned how to do a hook shot after watching a barn-storming basketball team perform the feat. He played for the varsity team in 1930‚Äì31, 1931‚Äì32 and 1932‚Äì33, leading the team in scoring his final two seasons while also helping to win the Indianapolis City Crown all three of his varsity seasons. Edwards was an all-state player who twice led the North Central Conference in scoring and also led Arsenal to the state quarterfinals as a junior in an era when there were no divisional breakdowns based on school enrollment. In his senior season of 1932‚Äì33, Arsenal Tech lost in the sectional final against Shortridge High School, a team they had beaten twice during the regular season, but still finished the year with a 22‚Äì3 record. College Edwards played one season of varsity basketball at the University of Kentucky. Due to NCAA rules, college freshmen were not allowed to play varsity sports at the time. As a freshman in 1933‚Äì34, he set a college scoring record 24 points per game in 17 games as he guided the Kentucky freshmen team to an undefeated season. In 1934‚Äì35, his sophomore year and his first of varsity eligibility, he led the Wildcats to a 19‚Äì2 record. Averaging nearly 20 ppg, he set a single season point record that lasted until 1947 when teams began playing more games each season. One loss was to a very good Michigan State squad (32‚Äì26) and the other to New York University (NYU) at the old Madison Square Garden. =NYU game= NYU and Kentucky were considered the best two college teams in the country at that time and playing for the national championship. A then-record 16,500 fans attended the match. A controversy occurred when sports writers said that Kentucky would have won this game if the two NYU players who were hanging onto Edwards throughout the game had fouls called on them. NYU won the game, 23‚Äì22. =Three-second rule= Edwards is generally recognized as the player responsible for the implementation of the three-second rule. Enacted in 1936, it was originally designed to limit rough play near the basket. The rule limits the time players can remain in the area in front of the basket known as the \\"paint\\" or free-throw lane. The rule has been modified and is still used today. =Early exit= In a different game that season, Edwards set another college basketball record, scoring 34 points against Creighton University. After coach Adolph Rupp's retirement in 1972 he was asked who was the best center he had ever seen play the game and his answer was Leroy Edwards. He said Edwards was the strongest player that he ever coached and he played above the rim. Edwards, selected to the First Team All-Southeastern Conference, was also named the Helms Athletic Foundation National College Player of the Year. Edwards left the University of Kentucky after just his sophomore year‚Äîan extremely rare decision for basketball players during that era‚Äîto start what would become an historical professional basketball career. Professional career When Edwards decided to play professional basketball he was considered the premier player in the country. In 1936 he signed his first pro contract with the Oshkosh All-Stars, a team in Wisconsin that played in the National Basketball League (NBL). This league was the forerunner to the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played for them from 1936 to 1949. He was a prolific scorer with either hand, left or right, could shoot from the outside and was an excellent defensive player. He accomplished so much at a time when game scores and point totals were much lower than today. In those days, the actual playing time was shorter. The game had 15-17 minute halves and no 24 second shot clock. Play was slower and teams would play zone defense and hold on to the ball for long periods of time, making it very difficult for a player to score many points in a game. Today, NBA games consist of four 12 minute quarters and each team takes over 75 shots per game. Edwards held a number of game scoring records. He was the first professional basketball player to score 35 points in a game when he did so against the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons on March 5, 1942. He led the NBL in scoring his first three years and in 1939 he led the league in every recorded offensive statistic. He ended his career as the second highest scorer in National Basketball League history. During Edwards's 12-year career, he was selected to the NBL First Team All-League six times and the Second Team All-League twice. He was also the League MVP three times. Oshkosh won the league championship six times and participated in 9 of 10 World Tournaments held in Chicago between 1939 and 1948. Edwards' team had the best record of all teams that were invited to the World Championship Tournaments, winning 20 games and losing 10. The Oshkosh All Stars were crowned the World Professional Champions in Chicago in 1942, and Edwards was the all-time leading point scorer in World Championship Tournament history. On February 14, 1945, United Press International recognized him as one of the Top 5 Basketball Players of All Time. =New York Rens rivalry= The New York Renaissance (Rens, for short) was the best black team of the era 1920‚Äì1940s. As in most sports, times were very difficult for black players. Nevertheless, the Rens were an excellent team with quality players; their record for the 1939 season was 112 wins and 7 losses. The epitome of their success came that year in Chicago at the first World Basketball Championship Tournament. The Rens had reached the finals and were playing the Oshkosh All-Stars. Oshkosh was favored because with Edwards at center, the All-Stars had beaten the Rens 7 out of 10 games they had played during the previous two years. That night the Rens beat Oshkosh 34‚Äì25. Edwards was the leading scorer of the tournament, scoring 49 points in three games, including a 12-point performance in the final. In total, the New York Rens and Oshkosh All-Stars played each other 33 times, with Oshkosh holding the edge with 17 wins. The entire New York Rens team is in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. Their team played over 3000 games and won 85% of them. John Isaacs, a member of the Hall of Fame Rens team, was asked about Edwards. His comments were that Edwards was a great player who could play in any era. Isaacs also said that Edwards never complained to the officials during a game and would play hard. He added that Hall of Famer Tarzan Cooper and Edwards would talk to each other during the games. He recalled one game when Edwards said something to Cooper about a rough move that he made. Cooper responded by quipping 'who do you think I learned it from?' =George Mikan match-ups= Hall of Fame center George Mikan of the Chicago Gears and the Minneapolis Lakers, who stood , was named the best basketball player from 1900 to 1950 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC). Mikan, however, did not get the opportunity to play against Edwards when Edwards was in his prime. They played against each other when Edwards was older and having chronic knee problems. Still, whenever they met on the court Edwards usually had the upper hand. Mikan later wrote in his book that Edwards was tall, weighed 260 lbs. and was the strongest player in professional basketball (although those measurements are exaggerated). When Mikan was asked who was the best player he ever faced he did not hesitate to say that it was Leroy Edwards. Hall of Famer Ray Meyer, Mikan's coach at DePaul University, wrote that Edwards was not merely a good basketball player, but a great one. Meyer was impressed with his agility. Edwards, he wrote, had a great move with his back to the basket. He would turn left, dribble with his right hand and he'd use his left hand to push the defender out of the way. As long as his move wasn't too obvious, the ref would not call a foul. Meyer said this was the first time he ever saw that move. Legacy Whether Leroy Edwards was playing college basketball for Kentucky or professionally against the New York Renaissance, Harlem Globetrotters or the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, he contributed to basketball's development and popularity in the United States. He excited fans in an era without television coverage and very little radio publicity. Edwards, a pioneer of basketball, is in the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame, Helms Athletic Foundation Hall of Fame and the University of Kentucky's Athletics Hall of Fame.

It is located just downriver from the historic Kingston-Port Ewen Suspension Bridge, which carried 9W until the Loughran Bridge was constructed. It is just upriver from where the Rondout empties into the Hudson River. It is a continuous girder bridge with four spans, totalling in length. In 1979, upon its opening, it was dedicated and named for John T. Loughran, a Kingston native whose judicial career was capped by his service as chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest judicial position, from 1945 until his death in 1953. Its construction required the demolition of a few blocks of the West Strand neighborhood on the north side. This rallied preservationists to get the decaying area, once Kingston's waterfront in the days of the Delaware and Hudson Canal, designated a historic district. It was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today many of the buildings have been renovated and the area is a popular destination for visitors to the city.

The work is in Latin and was published in imperial folio formatExcerpts from An account of travels in Brazil at the command of his Majesty, Maximilian Joseph I, King of Bavaria, in the years 1817 to 1820 by Dr. J.B von Spix and Dr. C.F.P. von Martius www.bluemacaws.org in Leipzig (Lipsiae) by T.O. Weigel, volume one in 1823 and the final volume in 1850. It includes more than 550 pages of text and 240 chromolithographs, including views of habitats and botanical dissections.The New York Botanical Garden Historia naturalis palmarum was based on Martius' travels in Brazil and Peru with zoologist Johann Baptist von Spix from 9 December 1817 to 1820. Their expedition was sponsored by the King of Bavaria, Maximilian I, with instructions to investigate natural history and tribal Indians. The pair travelled over 2,250 km (1,400 mi) throughout the Amazon Basin, the most species-rich palm region in the world, collecting and sketching specimens. They began in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo before making their way north and inland. They became the first non-Portuguese Europeans to obtain permission to visit the Brazilian Amazon.Arader Galleries On their return to Bavaria, the King awarded both men knighthoods and lifetime pensions.Palm and Cycad Societies of Australia In the first volume, Martius outlined the modern classification of palms and prepared the first maps of palm biogeography. The second volume described the palms of Brazil, and in the third, known as Expositio Systematica, he systematically described all known genera of the palm family, based on his own work and that of others. The majority of drawings of palms for the second volume, dedicated to Brazilian palms, were credited to Martius, with just a few landscapes, representing areas not travelled by Martius, taken from works by Frans Post and Johann Moritz Rugendas. The book was reprinted in two volumes in 1971. Other works by Martius based on the expedition were Reise in Brasilien (Journey in Brazil), published in three volumes in 1823, 1828 and 1831, and the massive 40-volume monograph Flora Brasiliensis which was completed by others in 1906.

The PVHD was developed in the mid-1970s and manufactured in the early 1980s as a cockpit instrument to assist the pilot with being better aware of the aircraft attitude at all times. The development of the PVHD was driven by a high incidence of military aircraft accidents due to \\"attitude awareness issues.\\" The PVHD was noted to have a subliminal effect on the pilot because in actual use the display was set so dim that it could barely be seen. The PVHD was well received by pilots that tested it in helicopters as well as fixed-wing aircraft. It was flown in F-4s and A-10s, as well as helicopters. Initial production in 1983, however, was for the SR-71 Blackbird as an aid when refueling in the air.Paul Crickmore, Lockheed Blackbird: Beyond The Secret Missions, 1993, page 233. The initial concept demonstration was done in Canadian military laboratories and later development was undertaken by Varian Canada in Georgetown, Ontario. In 1981, Varian sold the project to Garrett Manufacturing in Rexdale, Toronto, Ontario. What it does In the simplest variant, the PVHD projects a dim line of light across the full width of the cockpit instrument panel. This line is projected over the top of all instruments. As the aircraft pitches and rolls, the line appears to stay parallel to the horizon outside of the aircraft. There is a small blip in the center of the line to indicate which way is up. In actual use, the pilot initially sets the brightness of the line so that it just disappears when looking at it with their central vision. When the line does move due to an aircraft attitude change, the peripheral vision, being more sensitive to movement, picks up the movement and the brain subconsciously registers the information, and makes use of it. In all variants, the aircraft gyro system provides pitch and roll information for the processor, which drives the projection system to keep the line parallel to the earth horizon. The subliminal effect on the pilot's peripheral vision aids them in retaining attitude awareness and quickly correcting the onset of the aircraft deviating from the desired attitude. Benefits The PVHD helps when the real world horizon is blocked by weather or darkness, and the cockpit workload is so high that full attention cannot be given to the standard attitude instrument. The situation can be made worse by inertial effects of the aircraft fooling the pilot's organs of balance. These inertial effects can cause somato-gravic or somato-gyral illusions. In short, the pilot gets the wrong understanding of the aircraft attitude, often with a fatal outcome. Variants Several variants were built. The concept demonstration was done with conventional optics that projected a white line from a xenon arc lamp. The projector was driven by an analog computer and the lamp (line) was moved by servo motors. A later production version used a microprocessor to sample and process the pitch/roll gyro information and a HeNe laser as a light source for the projector. The projector consisted of X and Y axis galvanometers to scan the line across the cockpit at more than 30 times per second in the form of a vector scanned display. This type of projection technology is now commonly used in laser light shows. =Lockheed SR-71= The Lockheed SR-71 \\"Blackbird\\" reconnaissance aircraft was fitted with a PVHD system. The system also included a heading indication, using varying light intensities along different segments of the horizon line.SR-71 flight manual1-138 Peripheral Vision Display (PVD) (retrieved 6 March 2014) =Fairchild Republic YA-10B= During the development of the single-seat night-attack version of the A-10 Warthog aircraft a PVHD system similar to that of the Lockheed SR-71 was incorporated.NASA - Peripheral Vision Horizon Display (PVHD) (retrieved 26 January 2018) References =Notes= =Bibliography= * F4 test report * Flight Evaluation of the Concept of the Stage A Peripheral Vision Horizon Device (PVHD) Using the CH 135 Aircraft of 403 Squadron ‚Äì CEB Gagetown. * The Malcolm horizon: History and future * Editors Note, Defense Daily News, September 1, 1999 * http://medind.nic.in/imvw/imvw15709.html * Cohen, M.

In 2017, there were 26 households in the civil parish. History Embankment on the Shropshire Union Canal Different meanings have been suggested for the name 'Henhull'. Hen Heol is Welsh for 'old street', which might refer to the Roman road from Middlewich to Whitchurch, excavated in 1987, which runs through the parish.Cheshire County Council: Crewe and Nantwich Circular Walk: Walking the Trackways - Acton to Coppenhall (accessed 28 August 2007) Alternatively, Henhull or Henhill means a place for woodhens or other waterfowl. The hamlet of Bluestone is named after a granite boulder glacial deposit situated near the Burford crossroads in Acton civil parish, which was unearthed during road building and is believed to originate from Cumbria. The name is thought to derive from blue porphyritic crystals, which are no longer visible. A local legend suggests that the boulder was thrown at Acton church from Bickerton Hill by the Devil.Latham, p. 11, endpaper map The Battle of Nantwich of 1644 took place partly in Henhull, on the site of the present Nantwich Marina.

Tonika grew in national recognition and was part of the 1974 New Year‚Äôs celebrationhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd-p6KoH2eU (Dead Link) on Bulgarian National Television. In 1975, the group moved to Sofia and released their debut LP on the Balkan-ton label, which was the national record label. In 1976 and 1977, Tonika won the Bulgarian national music award Zlatniyat Orfey (Bulgarian: –ó–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–∏—è—Ç –û—Ä—Ñ–µ–π), or Golden Orpheus, which further confirmed their status as pop stars. In 1978, Tonika released their second LP, which featured many of the best studio musicians in Bulgaria. Tonika won many awards during the yearly music festival in Aytos for over two decades, particularly in the 1970s. Music has always been important in the culture of this former Iron Curtain republic, and Tonika has a considerable following today.http://www.tonikafamily.online.bg (Dead Link) Tonika performed more than 200 concerts per year in the 1970s in addition to their TV appearances, recordings, and rehearsals. The band is also known as Tonica, Tonica SV, Domino, and Familia Tonica (Tonika Family). In 1979, almost all of Tonika‚Äôs records and taped TV appearances (except a few hidden copies) were destroyed by the Bulgarian government and banned due to a political scandal that occurred during a tour of Western Europe and Asia. The group was forced to disband and they were not allowed to perform for two years. In 1994, the entire Tonika Family reunited and did four concerts in Burgas and Sofia. In 2000, a CD of the music performed at these concerts was released on the StefKos Music Label.

(November 11, 1906 - 1998) was an author, bibliophile, bibliographer, and collector of books and manuscripts. He donated a book collection of early Canadiana to McGill University. Library and Archives Canada considered him one of the greatest collectors of Canadian books and manuscripts. Lande devoted his life to collecting books and manuscripts, and to bestowing his collections upon favorite institutions. His habit as a collector was to gather material thematically, and then to catalog it in lavishly illustrated and bound volumes. Typically, the catalogues included a special section presenting important manuscript material transcribed and published for the first time. The books were printed in tiny editions, and distributed to friends, colleagues, and libraries.  Lande Canadiana Collection at McGill University  The original part of the Lande Canadiana Collection was acquired in 1965 and comprised some 2300 items. To this original donation, several additions were made between 1965 and 1975, both by gift and purchase. The Lande Collection now consists of some 12,000 items, including pamphlets, maps, prints (among them over fifty early views of Montreal), periodicals, government documents, and broadsides, as well as books. The Lande Collection contains material on the discovery and exploration of Canada, and its historical development to the end of the nineteenth century. Outstanding among the descriptions of early discoveries are Thevet's Les singularitez de la France antarctique, autrement nomm√©e amerique...(1558) and Wytfliet's Histoire universelle des Indes orientales et occidentales'...(1605), which has some of the earliest maps of Canada. The Jesuit Relations, of which the Collection holds thirteen seventeenth-century editions, are an invaluable primary source for the study of the early French Regime in Canada. Among other areas of concentration are the search for the Northwest Passage and Arctic exploration, the controversy over Confederation, and early Canadian imprints. One of the highlights of this last group is the first book printed in Montreal, Fleury Mesplet's R√©glement de la Confrerie de l'adoration perp√©tuelle du S. Sacrement et de la bonne mort (1776). An insight into early Canadian social history is provided by the personal narratives of such travellers as Kalm, Lambert, Weld, Heriot, Landmann, Bonnycastle and by the more than 200 ephemeral items which include broadsides, circulars and sheet music.  Specialist Subjects One of the most prominent characters featured in Lande's manuscript collections was the 18th-century economist and father of modern finance John Law (1671-1729). Published in the 1980s, Lande's catalogues of 18th-century commerce, trade and exploration contain descriptions of thousands of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera related to politics, the development of paper money in Europe and North America in the 18th century and draw heavily on his collection of John Law related manuscripts. The John Law collections build on the methods he established in his instrumental catalogue of Canadiana. He also had an extensive collection of William Blake manuscripts. His collections on Moravian missions to Labrador and on Canadian music, on Martin Buber, and on the American fur trade indicate the variety and extended scope of Lande's interests. Among correspondence, manuscript compositions, photographs and other records pertaining to L. Lande's fonds at Library and Archives Canada there's an autograph manuscript of the canon Freu Dich Des Lebens by Ludwig van Beethoven, dedicated to T.F.

It is part of the South Ukrainian Energy Complex. It is located near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk in Mykolaiv province, approximately south of Kyiv. The nuclear power station has three VVER-1000 pressurized water reactors and a net generation capacity of 2,850 megawatts (MW). It is at present the second largest of five nuclear power stations in Ukraine. From South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant a 750 kV powerline runs to Isaccea, Romania, but it is mostly dismantled or ruined. In 2013, following major upgrade work, unit 1 was given a 10-year license extension, which will take it beyond its original 30-year design lifetime. Similar extensions are planned for units 2 and 3, licensed until 2015 and 2019, respectively. Fuel supply The main supplier of fuel for nuclear power plants in Ukraine has been TVEL, with whom NNEGC signed a contract for the supply of nuclear fuel for Ukrainian WMR in 1997 until 2010. Under a US-Ukrainian initiative to reduce Ukraine's dependency on Russia for fuel, tied to the dismantling of its nuclear weapon arsenal, Energoatom had been using reactor core of unit 3 to test nuclear fuel produced by Westinghouse Electric Company in V√§ster√•s in Sweden, mixed with Russian assemblies. In August 2005, it was loaded with the first six experimental fuel assemblies produced by Westinghouse together with Russian fuel for a period of pilot operation. The pilot runs were \\"deemed unsuccessful, with Energoatom claiming manufacturing defects in the fuel led to a lengthy unscheduled outage at two of the units, while Westinghouse said that errors had been made during fuel loading.\\" Nevertheless, in 2008 Energoatom signed a fuel supply contract with Westinghouse to supply 630 nuclear fuel assemblies to its three reactors starting in 2011. Westinghouse shipped a reload batch of 42 fuel assemblies for the 3 units in mid-2009 to last for three years of commercial operation. In June 2010, Energoatom signed a long-term fuel supply contract with Russia's TVEL for its nuclear reactor fleet.

It is dedicated to Yan Po Nagar, the goddess of the country, who came to be identified with the Hindu goddesses Bhagavati and Mahishasuramardini, and who in Vietnamese is called Thi√™n Y Th√°nh M·∫´u. History A stele dated 781 indicates that the Cham King Satyavarman regained power in the area of \\"Ha-Ra Bridge\\", and that he restored the devastated temple. From this inscription can be deduced that the area previously had come under temporary foreign dominion, and that foreign vandals had damaged the already existing temple. Other steles indicate that the temple had contained a mukhalinga decorated with jewelry and resembling an angel's head. Foreign robbers, perhaps from Java, \\"men living on food more horrible than cadavers, frightful, completely black and gaunt, dreadful and evil as death\\" had arrived in ships, had stolen the jewelry and had broken the linga. Though the king had chased the robbers out to sea, the treasure had been lost forever. The steles also indicate that the king restored the linga in 784.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.192.Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., The Cham military leader Senapati Par, under the reign of Harivarman I, made endowments in 817. Senapati made attacks on the Khmers under Jayavarman II. Harivarman I was succeeded by his son, Vikrantavarman III, who also made endowments. A stele dated 918 by the Cham King Indravarman III states an order to build a golden statue to the goddess Bhagavati. Later steles report that the original gold statue was stolen by the Khmer's Rajendravarman II in 950, and that in 965, the king Jaya Indravarman I replaced the lost statue with a new stone one. A stele dated 1050 says that offerings of land, slaves, jewelry, and precious metals were made to the statue by Jaya Parameshvaravarman I. Paramabhodisattva made \\"rich offerings\\" in 1084 after reuniting the country. Jaya Indravarman III gave the temple a Shivalinga and a Shrishana Vishnu in 1141 and another donation in 1143. In 1160, Jaya Harivarman I \\"offered rich gifts\\". An inscription states Jayavarman VII of the Khmer Empire, \\"took the capital of Champa and carried of all the lingas.\\" Later steles indicate the celebration of a cult in honor of the goddess Yan Po Nagar, as well as the presence of statues dedicated to the principal deities of Hinduism and Buddhism.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.192 f. In the 17th century, the Viet people occupied Champa and took over the temple tower, calling it Thi√™n Y Th√°nh M√¢u Tower.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.198. A number of Vietnamese legends regarding the goddess and the tower have come into being. Site The towers of Po Nagar are located on a hill. The Po Nagar complex is situated on C√π Lao Mountain. It consists of three levels, the highest of which encompasses two rows of towers. The main tower is about 25 m high.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.209 ff. Durga, the slayer of the buffalo-demon, is represented on the pediment above the entrance to the temple. The temple's central image is a 1.2m tall stone statue of the goddess Yan Po Nagar sitting cross-legged, dressed only in a skirt, with ten hands holding various symbolic items. According to Vietnamese scholar Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, these attributes show that Yan Po Nagar was identified also with the Hindu goddess Mahishasuramardini or Durga, the slayer of the buffalo-demon. Another sculpture of the goddess Mahishasuramardini may be found in the pediment above the entrance to the temple: it depicts the four- armed goddess holding a hatchet, a lotus and a club, and standing on a buffalo.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.194 f., 212 f.

Population By 2003, there were already 20,000 Mongolians working in South Korea, making their population larger than the combined total of Mongolian Americans, Mongolians in Japan, and Mongolians in Europe. Five years later, their population had grown by 65% to an estimated 33,000 individuals, or 1.2% of the entire Mongolian population. The government of South Korea estimates that one out of every two urban households in Mongolia has a family member working in South Korea. According to South Korean government figures, 40% are residing in the country illegally; other estimates of the proportion of illegal migrants run as high as 70%. The ability of Mongolians to \\"pass\\" as Korean makes it easier for them than for other foreigners resident illegally to escape casual notice. The growth of the population has been so rapid that the Mongolian embassy in Seoul is largely unable to provide assistance to Mongolian residents; as a result, Mongolians have set up their own non-governmental organisations to provide mutual assistance, such as Dalain Salkhi (\\"Sea Breeze\\"). Motivations for migration Most Mongolians in South Korea are migrant workers employed in heavy industry. Some also run restaurants, trading companies, and grocery stores in Seoul, especially in the so-called \\"Central Asia Village\\" in Jung- gu's Gwanghui-dong, near Dongdaemun. Mongolians seeking to migrate to South Korea for work are required by South Korea's Ministry of Labor to obtain a score of at least 120 on the Korean Language Proficiency Test in order to receive permission to work in most industries; however, the required score for working in agriculture, fishing, and construction is lower. Demand to take the test is extremely high; for the 2007 sitting, some candidates queued for four days in chaotic conditions outside Ulan Bator's Central Stadium in May to register. A total of 14,929 candidates (9,892 men and 5,037 women) signed up for the test that year, of whom 14,606 actually sat for it; 44% (6,487) scored higher than 120 points, while 91% met the minimum mark for agriculture, fishing, and construction. Aside from migrant workers, Mongolians come to South Korea for other purposes as well. , there were also roughly 1,700 Mongolians who came to South Korea annually to pursue higher education. Some Mongolian women also come to South Korea as the brides of men they met through international marriage agencies; their average age is just 24.9 whereas that of their husbands is 44.5, with many being more educated than their husbands. Inter-ethnic relations Mongolians living in South Korea cite the age-based hierarchy of the Korean social structure as a major cultural difference with their homeland and a significant barrier to adaptation, noting that in Mongolia, people with age differences of five years still speak to one another as equals, but in Korea, they are obligated to use honorific forms of speech to address people even one year older than them. Others assert that Koreans are more polite to Westerners than to other Asians. Four Mongolians who saved the lives of 11 Koreans from a fire were given official rights to live and work in South Korea by the Immigration Department of the Ministry of Justice in 2007. Education South Korea has one school specifically aimed at the children of Mongolian migrant workers: the International Mongolian School, in Gwangjang-dong, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul. It was established in August 1999 with eight students. A large proportion of the students are the children of illegal immigrants who are unable to attend regular government schools. By 2011, it enrolled roughly 80 students in grades 1-9. It is officially authorised by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education to offer courses up to the high school level; due to a shortage of funding and space it only offers elementary and middle school classes, though they plan to begin building facilities for a high school division in 2011. It follows the curriculum of Mongolia, using Mongolian as the medium of instruction, while also assisting students to learn Korean. Of the 16 graduates in 2010, three planned to return to Mongolia for high school while the rest would enter schools in South Korea. South Korean teachers state that the students generally adapt well to South Korean schools, though the students themselves worry about ethnic bullying and the difficulty of adapting to the use of Korean as the medium of instruction (especially at engineering schools).

It is one of the best-known works of pop art, and among Lichtenstein's most important paintings. Whaam! was first exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City in 1963, and purchased by the Tate Gallery, London, in 1966. It has been on permanent display at Tate Modern since 2006. The left-hand panel shows a fighter plane firing a rocket that, in the right-hand panel, hits a second plane which explodes in flames. Lichtenstein conceived the image from several comic-book panels. He transformed his primary source, a panel from a 1962 war comic book, by presenting it as a diptych while altering the relationship of the graphical and narrative elements. Whaam! is regarded for the temporal, spatial and psychological integration of its two panels. The painting's title is integral to the action and impact of the painting, and displayed in large onomatopoeia in the right panel. Lichtenstein studied as an artist before and after serving in the United States Army during World War II. He practiced anti-aircraft drills during basic training, and he was sent for pilot training but the program was canceled before it started. Among the topics he tackled after the war were romance and war. He depicted aerial combat in several works. Whaam! is part of a series on war that he worked on between 1962 and 1964, and along with As I Opened Fire (1964) is one of his two large war-themed paintings. Background In 1943 Lichtenstein left his study of painting and drawing at The Ohio State University to serve in the U.S. Army, where he remained until January 1946. After entering training programs for languages, engineering, and piloting, all of which were canceled, he served as an orderly, draftsman and artist in noncombat roles. One of his duties at Camp Shelby was enlarging Bill Mauldin's Stars and Stripes cartoons. He was sent to Europe with an engineer battalion, but did not see active combat. As a painter, he eventually settled on an abstract-expressionist style with parodist elements. Around 1958 he began to incorporate hidden images of cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny into his abstract works. A new generation of artists emerged in late 1950s and early 1960s with a more objective, \\"cool\\" approach characterized by the art movements known today as minimalism, hard-edge painting, color field painting, the neo-Dada movement, Fluxus, and pop art, all of which re-defined the avant-garde contemporary art of the time. Pop art and neo-Dada re-introduced and changed the use of imagery by appropriating subject matter from commercial art, consumer goods, art history and mainstream culture. Lichtenstein achieved international recognition during the 1960s as one of the initiators of the pop art movement in America. Regarding his use of imagery MoMA curator Bernice Rose observed that Lichtenstein was interested in \\"challenging the notion of originality as it prevailed at that time.\\" Lichtenstein in 1967 Lichtenstein's early comics-based works such as Look Mickey focused on popular animated characters. By 1963 he had progressed to more serious, dramatic subject matter, typically focusing on romantic situations or war scenes. Comic books as a genre were held in low esteem at the time. Public antipathy led in 1954 to examination of alleged connections between comic books and youth crime during Senate investigations into juvenile delinquency; by the end of that decade, comic books were regarded as material of \\"the lowest commercial and intellectual kind\\", according to Mark Thistlethwaite of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Lichtenstein was not a comic-book enthusiast as a youth, but was enticed as an artist by the challenge of creating art based on a subject remote from the typical \\"artistic image\\". Lichtenstein admitted he was \\"very excited about, and very interested in, the highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love, hate, war, etc., in these cartoon images.\\" Lichtenstein's romance and war comic-based works took heroic subjects from small source panels and monumentalized them. Whaam! is comparable in size to the generally large canvases painted at that time by the abstract expressionists. It is one of Lichtenstein's many works with an aeronautical theme. He said that \\"the heroes depicted in comic books are fascist types, but I don't take them seriously in these paintings‚Äîmaybe there is a point in not taking them seriously, a political point. I use them for purely formal reasons.\\" History Whaam! adapts a panel by Irv Novick from the \\"Star Jockey\\" story from issue No. 89 of DC Comics' All-American Men of War (Feb. 1962). The original forms part of a dream sequence in which fictional World War II P-51 Mustang pilot Johnny Flying Cloud, \\"the Navajo ace\\", foresees himself flying a jet fighter while shooting down other jet planes. In Lichtenstein's painting, both the attacking and target planes are replaced by different types of aircraft. Paul Gravett suggests that Lichtenstein substituted the attacking plane with an aircraft from \\"Wingmate of Doom\\" illustrated by Jerry Grandenetti in the subsequent issue (#90, April 1962), and that the target plane was borrowed from a Russ Heathhttps://comicsalliance.com/russ-heaths-comic-about-being-ripped-off-by- roy-lichtenstein-will-give-you-a-new-appreciation-for-the-hero-initiative/ drawing in the third panel of page 3 of the \\"Aces Wild\\" story in the same issue No. 89. The painting also omits the speech bubble from the source in which the pilot exclaims \\"The enemy has become a flaming star!\\" Original comic book panel from DC Comics' All-American Men of War No. 89 (Feb. 1962) A smaller, single-panel oil painting by Lichtenstein around the same time, Tex!, has a similar composition, with a plane at the lower left shooting an air-to- air missile at a second plane that is exploding in the upper right, with a word bubble. The same issue of All-American Men of War was the inspiration for at least three other Lichtenstein paintings, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Brattata and Blam, in addition to Whaam! and Tex! The graphite pencil sketch, Jet Pilot was also from that issue. Several of Lichtenstein's other comics-based works are inspired by stories about Johnny Flying Cloud written by Robert Kanigher and illustrated by Novick, including Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Jet Pilot and Von Karp. Lichtenstein repeatedly depicted aerial combat between the United States and the Soviet Union. In the early and mid-1960s, he produced \\"explosion\\" sculptures, taking subjects such as the \\"catastrophic release of energy\\" from paintings such as Whaam! and depicting them in freestanding and relief forms. In 1963, he was parodying a variety of artworks, from advertising and comics and to \\"high art\\" modern masterpieces by C√©zanne, Mondrian, Picasso and others. At the time, Lichtenstein noted that \\"the things that I have apparently parodied I actually admire.\\" Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition was held at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City, from 10 February to 3 March 1962. It sold out before its opening. The exhibition included Look Mickey, Engagement Ring, Blam and The Refrigerator. According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, Whaam! was part of Lichtenstein's second solo exhibition at the Leo Castelli Gallery from 28 September to 24 October 1963, that also included Drowning Girl, Baseball Manager, In the Car, Conversation, and Torpedo...Los! Marketing materials for the show included the lithograph artwork, Crak! The Lichtenstein Foundation website says that Lichtenstein began using his opaque projector technique in 1962. in 1967 he described his process for producing comics-based art as follows: Lichtenstein may have substituted this image for the attacking plane from the subsequent issue of DC Comics' All-American Men of War No. 90 (April 1962). Whaam! was purchased by the Tate Gallery in 1966. In 1969, Lichtenstein donated his initial graphite- on-paper drawing Drawing for Whaam!, describing it as a \\"pencil scribble\\". According to the Tate, Lichtenstein claimed that this drawing represented his \\"first visualization of Whaam! and that it was executed just before he started the painting.\\" as cited in Although he had conceived of a unified work of art on a single canvas, he made the sketch on two sheets of paper of equal size‚Äîmeasuring . The painting has been displayed at Tate Modern since 2006. In 2012‚Äì13, both works were included in the largest Lichtenstein retrospective yet exhibited, visiting the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Tate Modern in London and the Centre Pompidou. Description Whaam! depicts a fighter aircraft in the left panel firing a rocket into an enemy plane in the right panel, which disintegrates in a vivid red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is emphasized by the use of the onomatopoeic lettering \\"WHAAM!\\" in the right panel, and a yellow-boxed caption with black lettering at the top of the left panel. The textual exclamation \\"WHAAM!\\" can be considered the graphic equivalent of a sound effect. This was to become a characteristic of his work‚Äîlike others of his onomatopoeic paintings that contain exclamations such as Bratatat! and Varoom! Whaam! is one of Lichtenstein's series of war images, typically combining vibrant colors with an expressive narrative. Whaam! is very large, measuring 1.7 m √ó 4.0 m (5 ft 7 in √ó 13 ft 4 in). It is less abstract than As I Opened Fire, another of his war scenes. Lichtenstein employs his usual comic-book style: stereotyped imagery in bright primary colors with black outlines, coupled with imitations of mechanical printer's Ben-Day dots. The use of these dots, which were invented by Benjamin Day to simulate color variations and shading, are considered Lichtenstein's \\"signature method\\". Whaam! departs from Lichtenstein's earlier diptychs such as Step-on-Can with Leg and Like New, in that the panels are not two variations of the same image. Although Lichtenstein strove to remain faithful to the source images, he constructed his paintings in a traditional manner, starting with a sketch which he adjusted to improve the composition and then projected on to a canvas to make the finished painting. In the case of Whaam!, the sketch is on two pieces of paper, and the finished work is painted with Magna acrylic and oil paint on canvas. Although the transformation from a single-panel conception into a diptych painting occurred during the initial sketch, the final work varies from the sketch in several ways. The sketch suggests that the \\"WHAAM!\\" motif would be colored white, although it is yellow in the finished work. Lichtenstein enlarged the main graphical subject of each panel (the plane on the left and the flames on the right), bringing them closer together as a result. Lichtenstein built up the image with multiple layers of paint. The paint was applied using a scrub brush and handmade metal screen to produce Ben-Day dots via a process that left physical evidence behind. The Ben-Day dots technique enabled Lichtenstein to give his works a mechanically reproduced feel. Lichtenstein said that the work is \\"supposed to look like a fake, and it achieves that, I think\\". Lichtenstein split the composition into two panels to separate the action from its consequence. The left panel features the attacking plane‚Äîplaced at a diagonal to create a sense of depth‚Äîbelow the text balloon, which Lichtenstein has relegated to the margin above the plane. In the right panel, the exploding plane‚Äîdepicted head-on‚Äîis outlined by the flames, accompanied by the bold exclamation \\"WHAAM!\\". Although separate, with one panel containing the missile launch and the other its explosion, representing two distinct events, the two panels are clearly linked spatially and temporally, not least by the horizontal smoke trail of the missile. Lichtenstein commented on this piece in a 10 July 1967, letter: \\"I remember being concerned with the idea of doing two almost separate paintings having little hint of compositional connection, and each having slightly separate stylistic character. Of course there is the humorous connection of one panel shooting the other.\\" Lichtenstein altered the composition to make the image more compelling, by making the exploding plane more prominent compared to the attacking plane than in the original. The smoke trail of the missile becomes a horizontal line. The flames of the explosion dominate the right panel, but the pilot and the airplane in the left panel are the narrative focus. They exemplify Lichtenstein's painstaking detailing of physical features such as the aircraft's cockpit. The other element of the narrative content is a text balloon that contains the following text: \\"I pressed the fire control ... and ahead of me rockets blazed through the sky ...\\" This is among the text believed to have been written by All-American Men of War editor Robert Kanigher. The yellow word \\"WHAAM!\\", altered from the red in the original comic-book panel and white in the pencil sketch, links the yellow of the explosion below it with the textbox to the left and the flames of the missile below the attacking plane. Lichtenstein's borrowings from comics mimicked their style while adapting their subject matter. He explained that \\"Signs and comic strips are interesting as subject matter. There are certain things that are usable, forceful and vital about commercial art.\\" Rebecca Bengal at PBS wrote that Whaam!'s graphic clarity exemplifies the ligne claire style associated with Herg√©, a cartoonist whose influence Lichtenstein acknowledged. Lichtenstein was attracted to using a cool, formal style to depict emotive subjects, leaving the viewer to interpret the artist's intention. published in He adopted a simplified color scheme and commercial printing-like techniques. The borrowed technique was \\"representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of Ben Day dots used in newspaper printing, and surrounding these with black outlines similar to those used to conceal imperfections in cheap newsprint.\\" Lichtenstein once said of his technique: \\"I take a cliche and try to organize its forms to make it monumental.\\" Reception The painting was, for the most part, well received by art critics when first exhibited. A November 1963 Art Magazine review by Donald Judd described Whaam! as one of the \\"broad and powerful paintings\\" of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery. In his review of the exhibition, The New York Times art critic Brian O'Doherty described Lichtenstein's technique as \\"typewriter pointillism ... that laboriously hammers out such moments as a jet shooting down another jet with a big BLAM\\". According to O'Doherty, the result was \\"certainly not art, [but] time may make it so\\", depending on whether it could be \\"rationalized ... and placed in line for the future to assimilate as history, which it shows every sign of doing.\\" The Tate Gallery in London acquired the work in 1966, leading to heated argument amongst their trustees and some vocal members of the public. The purchase was made from art dealer Ileana Sonnabend, whose asking price of ¬£4,665 (¬£ in currency) was reduced by negotiation to ¬£3,940 (¬£ in currency). Some Tate trustees opposed the acquisition, among them sculptor Barbara Hepworth, painter Andrew Forge and the poet and critic Herbert Read. Defending the acquisition, art historian Richard Morphet, then an assistant keeper at the Tate, suggested that the painting addresses several issues and painterly styles at the same time: \\"history painting, Baroque extravagance, and the quotidian phenomenon of mass-circulation comic strips.\\" The Times in 1967 described the acquisition as a \\"very large and spectacular painting\\". The Tate's director, Norman Reid, later said that the work aroused more public interest than any of its acquisitions since World War II. In 1968, Whaam! was included in the Tate's first solo exhibition of Lichtenstein's work. The showing attracted 52,000 visitors, and was organized with the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, which later hosted the exhibition from 4 November to 17 December 1967, before it traveled to three other museums. Analysis and interpretation For Jos√© Pierre, Whaam! represents Lichtenstein's 1963 expansion \\"into the 'epic' vein\\". Keith Roberts, in a 1968 Burlington Magazine article, described the explosion as combining \\"art nouveau elegance with a nervous energy reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism\\". Wendy Steiner believes the work is Lichtenstein's most successful and harmonious comic-based composition. She sees the narrative and graphic elements as complementary: the action and spatial alignment lead the viewer's eye from left to right so as to emphasize the relationship between the action and its explosive consequence. The ellipses of the text balloon present a progression which culminates with a \\"WHAAM!\\". The \\"coincidence of pictorial and verbal order\\" are clear for the Western viewer with the explanatory text beginning in the upper left and action vector moving from the left foreground to the right background, culminating in a graphical explosion in tandem with a narrative exclamation. Steiner says the striking incongruity of the two panels‚Äîthe left panel appearing to be \\"truncated\\", while the right depicts a centralized explosion‚Äîenhances the work's narrative power. Graphite-pencil-on-paper drawing entitled Drawing for Whaam! (1963), , was donated to the Tate in 1969. It shows the original plan was a single unified work. Lichtenstein's technique has been characterized by Ernst A. Busche as \\"the enlargement and unification of his source material ... on the basis of strict artistic principles\\". Extracted from a larger narrative, the resulting stylized image became in some cases a \\"virtual abstraction\\". By recreating their minimalistic graphic techniques, Lichtenstein reinforced the artificial nature of comic strips and advertisements. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material made his impersonally drawn motifs seem all the more empty. Busche also says that although a critique of modern industrial America may be read into these images, Lichtenstein \\"would appear to accept the environment as revealed by his reference material as part of American capitalist industrial culture\\". David McCarthy contrasted Lichtenstein's \\"dispassionate, detached and oddly disembodied\\" presentation of aerial combat with the work of H.C. Westermann, for whom the experience of military service in World War II instilled a need to horrify and shock. In contrast, Lichtenstein registers his \\"comment on American civilization\\" by scaling up inches-high comic book images to the oversized dimensions of history painting. Laura Brandon saw an attempt to convey \\"the trivialization of culture endemic in contemporary American life\\" by depicting a shocking scene of combat as a banal Cold War act. Carol Strickland and John Boswell say that by magnifying the comic book panels to an enormous size with dots, \\"Lichtenstein slapped the viewer in the face with their triviality.\\" H. H. Arnason noted that Whaam! presents \\"limited, flat colors and hard, precise drawing,\\" which produce \\"a hard-edge subject painting that documents while it gently parodies the familiar hero images of modern America.\\" The flat and highly finished style of planned brushstrokes can be seen as pop art's reaction against the looseness of abstract expressionism. Alastair Sooke says that the work can be interpreted as a symbolic self- portrait in which the pilot in the left panel represents Lichtenstein \\"vanquishing his competitors in a dramatic art-world dogfight\\" by firing a missile at the colorful \\"parody of abstract painting\\" in the right panel. According to Ernesto Priego, while the work adapts a comic-book source, the painting is neither a comic nor a comics panel, and \\"its meaning is solely referential and post hoc.\\" It directs the attention of its audience to features such as genre and printing methods. Visually and narratively, the original panel was the climactic element of a dynamic page composition. Lichtenstein emphasizes the onomatopoeia while playing down articulated speech by removing the speech balloon. According to Priego, \\"by stripping the comics panel from its narrative context, Whaam! is representative in the realm of fine art of the preference of the image-icon over image-narrative\\". Whaam! is sometimes said to belong to the same anti-war genre as Picasso's Guernica, a suggestion dismissed by Bradford R. Collins. Instead, Collins views the painting as a revenge fantasy against Lichtenstein's first wife Isabel, conceived as it was during their bitter divorce battle (the couple separated in 1961 and divorced in 1965). Legacy Marla F. Prather observed that Whaam!'s grand scale and dramatic depiction contributed to its position as a historic work of pop art. With As I Opened Fire, Lichtenstein's other monumental war painting, Whaam! is regarded as the culmination of Lichtenstein's dramatic war-comics works, according to Diane Waldman. It is widely described as either Lichtenstein's most famous work, or, along with Drowning Girl, as one of his two most famous works. Andrew Edgar and Peter Sedgwick describe it, along with Warhol's Marilyn Monroe prints, as one of the most famous works of pop art. Gianni Versace once linked the two iconic pop art images via his gown designs. According to Douglas Coupland, the World Book Encyclopedia used pictures of Warhol's Monroes and Whaam! to illustrate its Pop art entry. Dave Gibbons created an alternate version of the Novick original with text that parodies Lichtenstein's work. Comic books were in turn affected by the cultural impact of pop art. By the mid-1960s, some comic books were displaying a new emphasis on garish colors, emphatic sound effects and stilted dialogue‚Äîthe elements of comic book style that had come to be regarded as camp‚Äîin an attempt to appeal to older, college-age readers who appreciated pop art. Gravett observed that the \\"simplicity and outdatedness [of comic books] were ripe for being mocked\\". Whaam! was one of the key works exhibited in a major Lichtenstein retrospective in 2012‚Äì2013 that was designed, according to Li-mei Hoang, to demonstrate \\"the importance of Lichtenstein's influence, his engagement with art history and his enduring legacy as an artist\\". In his review of the Lichtenstein Retrospective at the Tate Modern, Adrian Searle of The Guardian‚Äîwho was generally unenthusiastic about Lichtenstein's work‚Äîcredited the work's title with accurately describing its graphic content: \\"Whaam! goes the painting, as the rocket hits, and the enemy fighter explodes in a livid, comic-book roar.\\" Daily Telegraph critic Alastair Smart wrote a disparaging review in which he acknowledged Lichtenstein's reputation as a leading figure in \\"Pop Art's cheeky assault on the swaggering, self-important Abstract Expressionists\\", whose works Smart said Whaam! mimicked by its huge scale. Smart said the work was neither a positive commentary on the fighting American spirit nor a critique, but was notable for marking \\"Lichtenstein's incendiary impact on the US art scene\\". Detractors have raised concerns over Lichtenstein's appropriation, in that he directly references imagery from other sources in Whaam! and other works of the period. Some have denigrated it as mere copying, to which others have countered that Lichtenstein altered his sources in significant, creative ways. In response to claims of plagiarism, the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation has noted that publishers have never sued for copyright infringement, and that they never raised the issue when Lichtenstein's comics-derived work first gained attention in the 1960s. Other criticism centers on Lichtenstein's failure to credit the original artists of his sources; Ernesto Priego implicates National Periodicals in the case of Whaam!, as the artists were never credited in the original comic books. In Alastair Sooke's 2013 BBC Four documentary that took place in front of Whaam! at the Tate Modern, British comic book artist Dave Gibbons disputed Sooke's assertion that Lichtenstein's painting improved upon Novick's panel, saying: \\"This to me looks flat and abstracted, to the point of view that to my eyes it's confusing. Whereas the original has got a three- dimensional quality to it, it's got a spontaneity to it, it's got an excitement to it, and a way of involving the viewer that this one lacks.\\" Gibbons has parodied Lichtenstein's derivation of the Novick work.

Moran was killed by a suicide car bomb at a checkpoint just outside Khurmal, in northeast Iraq near the border with Iran during the Iraq War. He was the first international media casualty of the Iraq war. According to the Media Entertainment & Arts Alliance, Moran was one of three Australian cases where journalist(s) have been killed with impunity. Personal details Paul Moran was the youngest in a family of four boys. He was born and raised in Adelaide to parents, Gerry and Kath Morgan. His alma mater was Sacred Heart College in Adelaide. In 1990, Moran moved to London, and it was here that he made his initial Middle East contacts. He was married to Ivana Rapajic and the couple had a daughter who was born one month before Moran's death at the age of 39. Career Paul Moran was a freelance cameraman for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He moved to London 1990 and it was there that he made his initial Middle East contacts which were to inspire his interest in this region. Moran's working relationship with the Rendon Group and the Iraqi National Congress (INC) led to a high-profile international news story that purported to document a covert Iraqi program to develop weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq War. Moran worked for the ABC as a cameraman in northern Iraq in 2003. Death Moran worked for the ABC of Australia and he was travelling from Sulaymaniyah to a base that had been struck by US missiles and belonged to the Ansar al-Islam on 22 March 2003. His group just arrived at a check point and Moran was shooting video when a car bomb exploded in a passing taxi, killing Moran and injuring Eric Campbell. Three or four other people besides Moran died at the checkpoint in Khurmal and 23 others in addition to Campbell were injured. The Ansar al-Islam were accused of carrying out the car bomb attack in response to the earlier US attack. Context Paul Moran was recruited after Iraq invaded Kuwait to work for an exiled Kuwait TV service. Those who knew him said he preferred the independent life of a freelancer. He spent a year making a documentary about refugees and the humanitarian issues they faced, en titled, Dangerously Adrift. According to the Committee to Protect Journalist, as of 2013 one- hundred and fifty journalist have been killed in Iraq since the US invasion. Reactions Eric Campbell, who is a journalist for ABC TV, blamed Mullah Krekar, a Salafist of Ansar al-Islam, for the attack. Ko√Øchiro Matsuura, the director of UNESCO, said, \\"In a war that also includes a fierce media battle, the task of seeking independent information is especially vital if world public opinion is to avoid being the target of manipulation and propaganda\\" and the killing of journalists like Moran was a violation of Article 79 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Convention. Foundation Paul Moran Foundation was established by his wife. The non-for-profit funded a children's library in Erbil, which is in the Kurdish area.

This episode first aired in the United States on Sunday, August 19, 2007. Plot synopsis A performance at a local \\"World Music Jam\\" results in the Conchords gaining two new fans, but Mel is suspicious of the newcomers and their motives. Murray encourages the band to adopt a more \\"rock star\\" attitude. Plot At a band meeting at a local restaurant, Murray and the band discuss ways to improve their 'rock' image. Murray announces that Mel has won the fan competition -- the prize is to cook the guys dinner at her place. After the meeting they head off to a gig which turns out to be a 'World Music Jam'. When it is their turn on stage they begin to perform \\"Rock The Party\\", but the show MC is unimpressed and stops them early. Their performance has interested two girls at the bar though, Summer and Rain. They introduce themselves and flirt with the boys, much to Mel's displeasure. Murray encourages the guys to be seen drinking beer to improve their image despite the fact that Bret and Jemaine both dislike it. Bret and Jemaine stop by Dave's place to borrow some \\"cool and sexy\\" clothes from him. Jemaine requests clothes that project a \\"casual Prince\\" image. Dave complains about his room- mates whom he vehemently denies are his parents. At the consulate, Murray shows them how he answers the band's emails for them and demonstrates the webcams that he has had installed in their apartment without their knowledge. Murray is pleased that the girls from the gig have joined the fan club. He reminds them about the dinner with Mel but the guys have a double date with the two new fans. Murray insists that they go and implores them not to upset their old fans \\"like Zed Zed Top did\\". Bret and Jemaine take Summer and Rain to dinner at Mel's place. Mel is hostile towards the new women and is defensive when asked about her husband, who Bret discovers has been banished to the basement. Mel tells Bret that she thinks the new fans are only interested in sex, which leads them to cut the dinner short and leave with Summer and Rain. At Summer's place the girls offer the boys acid tabs which they are reluctant about, but they end up agreeing to take a sixteenth of a tab each. Afterwards, Summer suggests to Jemaine and Bret -- separately -- that they have a threesome, so each tries to send the other bandmate home. They soon discover that Summer meant her and the two guys. That idea doesn't appeal to the guys much, so they attempt to sneak out but Summer catches them. When they tell Murray about the new fans giving them drugs and wanting to have a threesome, he is impressed. He thinks it is very \\"rock and roll.\\" Unfortunately it turns out that Summer and Rain have now dropped out of the fan club. So has an upset Mel, leaving them fanless. During the end credits, Bret and Jemaine are talking in bed about the threesome the night before. Murray rings them to tell them to get some sleep. He has been watching on the webcam -- and so, it seems, has Mel. Notes * We learn that Dave's full name is Devjeet and he lives with his parents. * The host of the \\"World Music Jam\\" is played by singer Daryl Hall of Hall & Oates. * In Mel's bathroom, she has a picture of Bret and Jemaine's head on the same naked body (polycephaly). Bret later hallucinates this same image during his \\"Prince of Parties\\" LSD trip. * Director Taika Waititi and writer Duncan Sarkies have worked together before. Sarkies was the writer of the 1999 New Zealand film Scarfies, in which Waititi starred.

Part of the song in which Bret and Jemaine rap is similar to MC Miker G. and Deejay Sven's \\"Holiday Rap\\". =\\"The Prince of Parties\\"= After taking some acid, the hallucinating boys sing \\"The Prince of Parties\\", a song with appropriately trippy lyrics and a video featuring Bret, Jemaine, Mel, Summer and Rain dancing around a forest glade tempted by a satyr played by Murray. The song is reminiscent of the later work of the Beatles (including a reference to Sitar guru Ravi Shankar), as is the imagery shown while the song is playing, which appears to be inspired by the video for Rain. Also the psychedelic music made by Donovan in the late 1960s, complete with trippy wordplay, and fey vocals is clearly an inspiration on the song. = Other songs = The band begins to play \\"Rock the Party\\" at the world music gig, but are cut short by the MC.

This episode first aired in the United States on Sunday, August 26, 2007. Plot synopsis The boys play a gig in a club to just a handful of people. After the gig when Bret and Jemaine are at the bar, a \\"semi- professional\\" actor named Ben introduces himself. He thinks they are a comedy act and that Bret and Jemaine are just playing characters. He offers them his card expressing a wish to work with them in the future. At a post-show debriefing Murray gets depressed about the lack of success he has had promoting the band to record companies. Bret and Jemaine visit Ben at the dry cleaners where he works. They ask him to call Murray posing as a record company executive and let him down gently. Ben calls Murray posing as \\"Stefan Gucci\\", but after Murray starts begging and crying, he breaks down and agrees to give the band a record deal. Murray and the boys go to dinner with \\"Stefan Gucci\\". Despite Jemaine's attempts to get them out of the mess, Murray and Bret agree to the two-million dollar deal that Ben offers them. Following the filming of a The Lord of the Rings-themed music video, the boys try to tell Murray about the mistake, but his excited mood causes them to postpone the bad news. They finally get around to telling him the following night after Murray throws them an expensive wrap party. A fuming Murray storms off. Bret and Jemaine visit Ben again to discuss the mess. He gives them an I.O.U. for the money Murray has spent. He tells them he will be able to pay them back soon because he has got a part in a Martin Scorsese movie about a dry cleaner, but they don't believe him. They visit Murray at his office and make up with him. They even manage to cheer him up a little. During the credits, we see Ben playing a scene with John Turturro in the aforementioned film, titled Dry Cleaner. Notes * In the opening nightclub scene, Bret is wearing a T-shirt made from the picture of Sally he embroidered for her in the \\"Sally Returns\\" episode. * The basic plot of this episode was previously used in the first episode of the Flight of the Conchords radio series. Songs The following songs were featured in this episode: =\\"Cheer Up, Murray\\"= Bret and Jemaine sing \\"Cheer Up, Murray\\" to Murray after the disappointing concert. They attempt to cheer him up by describing all the good things in his life, although they can't help slipping in some not-so-good things as well. The scene takes place in the store room of the night club. During the song we see a number of short sequences featuring aspects of Murray's life depicted through animated pictures in a photo album. =\\"Frodo (Don't Wear the Ring)\\"= In a park, the guys film a music video parodying The Lord of the Rings.

Several other episodes have contained references to The Lord of the Rings as well, usually in the context that it is one of the few things for which New Zealand is famous. ‚ÄúFrodo, Don‚Äôt Wear the Ring‚Äù plays off of Simon & Garfunkel imagery and calls back to Led Zeppelin‚Äôs LOTR-inspired riffs.

This episode first aired in the United States on Sunday, September 2, 2007. Plot synopsis Bret and Jemaine arrive at Murray's office for a band meeting to discover that Murray has hired a bongo player (Todd Barry) without consulting them. Astonished, they demand Murray fire him, but Murray convinces them to give Todd a chance. At band rehearsal they discover that Todd the bongo player has a tendency to launch into long bongo solos, which they try to persuade him out of. Todd wants them to try one of the songs he has written about dogs, but they are not impressed. After their first gig together -- at which Todd has again launched into a long bongo solo -- they try to convince Murray that Todd has to go because he is not \\"cool\\". But Murray refuses because Todd is popular and is bringing the band more fans. Despite this, the next day Jemaine attempts to fire him, but Todd's powers of persuasion are too much for him and he ends up firing Bret instead. Bret then does his angry dance. After unsuccessfully attempting to weasel his way back into the band, Bret gives up and forms a new band of his own \\"The Original Flight of the Conchords\\" with a keytar player he has met named Demitri (Demetri Martin). Despite Murray's reluctance to manage both bands, they are surprised to discover that the two new incarnations of The Conchords are more successful than Bret and Jemaine ever were. Bret and Jemaine are still not pleased, however, since neither of them are getting along that well with their respective band-mates. After a very successful gig in which \\"Flight of the Conchords\\" is the opening act for \\"The Original Flight of the Conchords\\", a pleased Murray suggests that the two bands merge to form a supergroup. Instead Todd and Demetri announce that they want to split from Bret and Jemaine and team up together to form the \\"Crazy Dogggz\\". One month later, the song Todd had tried to get the Conchords to play, \\"Doggy Bounce\\", is number one in 24 countries. The Crazy Dogggz are touring the world and a busy and now-rich Murray is neglecting the Conchords. Even worse, their once- devoted fan Mel has also switched allegiance to the other band. The episode ends with Bret and Jemaine doing the angry dance. Songs The following songs were featured in this episode: =\\"Bret's Angry Dance\\"= This song is an instrumental, and is played when Bret starts dancing to vent his anger on being fired from the band. The dance closely follows the style of Kevin Bacon's angry dance in Footloose. The song is reprised over the closing credits, with Bret and Jemaine dancing. =\\"Doggy Bounce\\"= Only one new song appears in this episode and it is not, at least in a plot sense, a Conchords song. The Crazy Dogggz song \\"Doggy Bounce\\", sung by Todd and Demetri, features somewhat childish lyrics set to a simple melody. The music video for it, which Bret and Jemaine watch on television, features Todd and Demitri in suits accompanied by four female dancers wearing doggy ears. It resembles very closely the \\"Macarena\\" music video by Los del Rio from 1996.Los del Rio - \\"Macarena\\" (YouTube) Murray's English bulldog, Toby, also makes an appearance. In the next episode, the first episode of season two, we learn that Todd plagiarized this song from a Polish band. =Other songs= During the scenes in which the various incarnations of the band are performing, we see snippets of \\"Robots\\". Cultural references Early in the episode Bret mentions to Jemaine that he sometimes dances \\"when he is angry\\". Later in the episode we see Bret launch into an elaborate dance sequence mimicking the Kevin Bacon dance from the 1984 film Footloose.Kenny Loggins - \\"Footloose\\" Music video featuring dance sequence from Footloose (YouTube) During the end credits both Bret and Jemaine begin the same dance. In one scene, Jemaine and Todd arrive at Murray's office wearing leather jackets. Murray remarks that \\"the Fonzies have arrived\\" referring to the character Fonzie played by Henry Winkler from the 1970s TV series Happy Days. The title is a reference to the concept of a Fifth Beatle. After a gig, Murray makes a reference to the Pied Piper, relating his \\"coolness\\" to that of Todd's. The band name Crazy Dogggz refers to the band Wylde Ratttz from the 1998 film Velvet Goldmine. In the show Todd specifically says he wants it to be spelled with three g's and a z.

The earliest Mongol exchange students, all three of them women, came to Japan in 1906, when Mongolia was still ruled by the Qing Dynasty. Japan was also a popular destination for students from Mengjiang (in today's Inner Mongolia) in the late 1930s and early 1940s; among them were several who would go on to become famous scholars, such as Chinggeltei.

Aside from Mongolian citizens, there were also estimated to be roughly 4,000 members of the Mongolian minority of China residing in Japan . Like migrants from Mongolia proper, they also came mostly on student visas, beginning in the 1990s; they were sponsored by professors of Mongolian studies at Japanese universities. They are a close-knit community; they reside mostly in the Nerima and Sugamo areas of Tokyo and in many cases the same apartment has been occupied serially by successive migrants for more than a decade, with each passing the lease on to another migrant before leaving the country or moving on to different accommodation.

Set in the French region of Brittany, the novel combines military history with a love story between the aristocratic Marie de Verneuil and the Chouan royalist Alphonse de Montauran. It takes place during the 1799 post-war uprising in Foug√®res. Balzac conceived the idea for the novel during a trip to Brittany arranged by a family friend in 1828. Intrigued by the people and atmosphere of the region, he began collecting notes and descriptions for later use. After publishing an Avertissement for the novel, he released three editions ‚Äì each of them revised significantly. The first novel Balzac published without a pseudonym, he used many titles as he wrote and published, including Le Gars, Les Chouans ou la Bretagne il y a trente ans, and Le Dernier Chouan ou la Bretagne en 1800. Following closely in the footsteps of Sir Walter Scott, the novel uses its truthful historical backdrop to tell a fictional story of people who sculpted the past. The novel addresses themes of passionate love, vengeful trickery, and social status. While it is disdained by critics in favor of Balzac's later work, the novel marks a turning point in his life and artistry.  Background  In the wake of the French Revolution, groups of royalists loyal to the House of Bourbon rose up against the new government. One group was the Chouans of Brittany, led by Jean Chouan. They allied themselves with counter- revolutionary forces in Vend√©e and by 1793 the Revolt in the Vend√©e had begun.\\"Chouans.\\" The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Vol. 6. New York: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., 1911. Wikisource. 25 November 2007. The insurrection was put down by the republic, and within two years the royalist forces had been routed.\\"Vend√©e, Wars of the.\\" The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Vol. 27. New York: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., 1911. Wikisource. 25 November 2007. A series of insurrections took place in the Brittany region (highlighted) after the French Revolution. Royalist sentiment did not evaporate, however, and in Brittany, violence between the two sides ‚Äì \\"Blue\\" Revolutionaries against \\"White\\" Chouans ‚Äì continued as the Chouannerie, even when Napoleon took power in 1799.Crawford, p. 12. The Bonaparte forces responded as the republic had, and the Chouans were defeated ‚Äì although political divisions and resentment lingered for more than a century. At the start of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels captured the ebb and flow of society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.Crawford, p. 8. Honor√© de Balzac was profoundly influenced by Scott (as well as Irish writer Maria Edgeworth), and decided to write novels using France's turbulent history as a literary backdrop in the same way they had used the history of Scotland and Ireland.Crawford, pp. 8‚Äì10.Lukacs pp. 92-96 Balzac had previously only published potboiler novels under a variety of pseudonyms, books designed to excite readers and sell copies.Robb, pp. 85‚Äì93. He had also engaged in a series of ill-fated speculative investments, which left him in considerable debt.Robb, pp. 130‚Äì138. Nevertheless, he believed in his skills as a writer, and awaited success around every corner.  Preparations and publications  In September 1828 Balzac visited the home of a family friend and retired general, the Baron de Pommereul, in Foug√®res. He spent several weeks learning about the insurrection (which Pommereul had fought against). He pored over his host's books and interviewed the townspeople about their experiences during the time of the uprising. Pommereul owned a castle which had been the headquarters of the Comte de Puisaye, a royalist leader involved with a failed invasion of royalist exiles at Quiberon. This incursion had been aided by the Chouans, and Balzac began collecting events and people as inspiration for his novel.Crawford, pp. 10‚Äì11. Balzac stayed with a family friend in Foug√®res, which had seen Chouan activity in 1799. While staying with Pommereul, he was given a room with a desk facing the Pellerine Mountain, which Balzac used as the setting for the book's first scene. He wandered around the city, taking in details to use in his descriptions of the landscape.Crawford, p. 11. In researching recent history, Balzac was examining events from his first years on the planet. Biographer Graham Robb notes that the original subtitle of the book was La Bretagne en 1799 ‚Äì the year of Balzac's birth. As Robb puts it, \\"the discovery of contemporary history took Balzac back to his childhood.\\"Robb, pp. 145-174. As he neared completion of his novel ‚Äì originally titled Le Gars ‚Äì Balzac wrote an announcement heralding its imminent publication. Under the pseudonym \\"Victor Morillon\\" and writing in the third person, he describes his intent to \\"place his country's history in the hands of the man in the street ‚Ä¶ to illuminate and make the ordinary mind realize the repercussions that entire populations feel of royal discord, feudal dissension and popular uprising‚Ä¶.\\"Balzac, p. 26. In the Avertissement, he praises Scott as \\"a man of genius\\" while noting his limitations, especially when writing of romance: \\"on his lyre the strings are missing that can sing of love‚Ä¶.\\" Balzac ‚Äì or, rather, \\"Morillon\\" ‚Äì also declares his intention to write a companion volume entitled Le Capitaine des Boutefeux (The Captain of the Firebrands), about war in fifteenth-century Paris. This later work was never completed.Hunt, p. 15. Later editions of the novel were revised significantly, partly to please Balzac's paramour Ewelina Ha≈Ñska. By the time the novel was published in March 1829, Balzac had changed its title (in response to complaints from Mme. de Pommereul) to Le dernier Chouan ou La Bretagne en 1800, and signed the novel \\"M. Honor√© Balzac\\". It was the first book he published without a pseudonym.Robb, p. 149. In 1834 a second edition was published under the name Les Chouans ou La Bretagne en 1799. It had been heavily revised, as per Balzac's style of constantly reworking texts, even after their release. He had been corresponding with Ewelina Ha≈Ñska, who wrote to him anonymously in 1832. In an attempt to please her, he changed some of the language in Les Chouans for its second edition. \\"If only you knew,\\" he wrote to her, \\"how much there is of you in every altered phrase of Chouans!\\"Quoted in Crawford, p. 22. The second edition also demonstrates the author's maturing political philosophy (softening his representation of the royalists), and the evolved female characters testify to his relationship with Ha≈Ñska.Hunt, p. 16. When the third edition was published in 1845, Balzac was in love with his own creation. He had written two years earlier to Ha≈Ñska: \\"There's no doubt about it ‚Äì it is a magnificent poem. I had never really read it before.‚Ä¶ The passion is sublime, and I now understand why you have a cherished and special devotion to this book.‚Ä¶ All in all, I am very pleased with it.\\"Quoted in Crawford, p. 24. In a preface to the third edition, he described his plans for a part of La Com√©die Humaine called Sc√®nes de la vie militaire (Scenes from Military Life). In addition to Les Chouans with its focus on guerrilla combat, he planned another called Les Vend√©ans about the earlier full-scale civil war. Although in 1844 he discussed traveling to western France to write the book, it was never written.Crawford, pp. 22‚Äì23.  Plot summary  At the start of the novel, the Republican Commander Hulot is assaulted by Chouan forces, who convert dozens of conscripts. An aristocrat, Marie de Verneuil, is sent by Joseph Fouch√© to subdue and capture the royalist leader, the Marquis de Montauran, also known as \\"Le Gars\\". She is aided by a detective named Corentin. Eventually, Marie becomes smitten with her target. In defiance of Corentin and the Chouans whom she detests, she devises a plan to marry the Chouan leader. Fooled by Corentin into believing that Montauran loves her mortal enemy Madame du Gua, Marie orders Hulot to destroy the rebels. She discovers her folly too late and tries, unsuccessfully, to save her husband the day after their marriage.  Style  The style of Les Chouans was heavily influenced by Sir Walter Scott. Scott's influence is felt throughout the novel. Lengthy descriptions of the countryside are interrupted constantly by tangents explaining the history of Brittany and its people. The pastoral setting is integrated into the plot, particularly the guerrilla combat of the Chouans.Hunt, p. 19. In complementing individual with environs Balzac also shows the influence of James Fenimore Cooper, whose The Last of the Mohicans had impressed the French author. Like the Mahicans of Cooper's novel, the Chouan insurgents are skilled at using their surroundings, coming out of the woods in more ways than one.Crawford, p. 19. Some critics claim that Balzac surpassed Scott in some respects. In his introduction to the 1901 edition, poet and critic George Saintsbury writes that the character of Montauran enjoys \\"a freedom from the flatness which not infrequently characterizes Sir Walter's own good young men.\\"Saintsbury, pp. ix-xiv. By foregrounding the affair between Montauran and Marie, Balzac indicates passion as the central theme of history. As he writes in the 1842 foreword to La Com√©die Humaine: \\"[L]a passion est toute l'humanit√©. Sans elle religion, l'histoire, le roman, l'art seraient inutiles.\\" (\\"[P]assion is all of humanity. Without it religion, history, literature, and art would be useless.\\")Quoted in Hunt, p. 19. Because of its extended conversations, intricate descriptions and lengthy asides, the book is considered \\"heavy\\" by some critics.Hunt, p. 21. In later editions its chapter breaks were removed (though some versions now restore them), and the work is in three sections ‚Äì the final of which comprises nearly half the novel. The novel's feel is compounded by the lack of clarity on some points; some characters' motives are unclear even at the end, and the chaotic sequence of events is difficult to track.Hunt, pp. 20‚Äì21.  Themes  = Passionate history = Although he venerated Scott's writing skill and use of history as backdrop, Balzac worked to more accurately depict the turbulence of the human heart ‚Äì and its effect on history. He considered Scott's view of women unrefined, and believed this led to a stale representation of human behavior as a result.Hunt, p. 18. In Les Chouans, Balzac places the romance of Montauran and Marie de Verneuil at the center of the narrative, around which all other elements revolve. For this reason (and owing to the florid descriptions of romantic elements), the novel has been compared to William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. Both stories explore love among feuding parties; both involve vengeful, scheming individuals; and both end in tragedy for the newly-wed couple.Hunt, pp. 16‚Äì17. As the translator Marion Ayton Crawford puts it: \\"Hero and heroine are star- crossed lovers, whose fate is brought about by forces of the times acting on their own internal weaknesses‚Ä¶.\\"Crawford, p. 20. Although Balzac himself did not marry until 1850, he was fascinated by the subject. Soon after Les Chouans was published in 1829, he released a treatise about the institution called Physiologie du Mariage. His attention to the details of relationships ‚Äì failed and successful ‚Äì are woven into Les Chouans, and Marie herself is based on a woman with whom he had had an affair.Crawford, pp. 21‚Äì22. = Devious ferocity = Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to the happy couple, plot and scheme endlessly to bring about the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, but by the end of the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette.Crawford, p. 17. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.Crawford, p. 18. Marie herself begins the operation on a quest to seduce and betray her target. Her reversal (followed by two subsequent changes of heart, back to the original mission and then in opposition to it) counterbalance the wickedness of Madame du Gua and Corentin. Her ultimate fidelity to the object of her desire demonstrates the possibility of sincere passion, even as the other pair speak to the venom of the slighted heart.Hunt, p. 16‚Äì17. = Social hierarchy = The allure of class respectability is another constant in Les Chouans, as it is for Balzac's entire oeuvre. Marie's birth as an illegitimate child contributes to her position at the start of the novel. The ups and downs of her young adult life land her in Corentin's hands, yearning for the 300,000-franc reward promised to her on the capture of Montauran. Marie's focus changes from money to marriage, a sign of hope amid the tragedy of circumstances.Crawford, pp. 20‚Äì21. When she first considers Montauran, she recognizes that a return of the king would bring privileges; still, her oscillating actions follow the path of her passions, not rational self-interest. 1901 English edition of The Works of Honor√© de Balzac, Volume XV: The Chouans, The Gondreville Mystery, and Other Stories Montauran, on the other hand, is devoted wholly to the royalist cause, and chafes against the ignorant nobles supporting it.Hunt, p. 20. He fights for the Chouan cause because he believes in it, not for the personal gain sought by the aristocrats in whose midst he works. He gives up the cause for Marie, but only as a result of an unclear series of events, the product of everyone's intertwined double-crossing.  Reception and impact  Les Chouans is considered Balzac's first real success as a writer ‚Äì a milestone for which he was prepared, evidenced by his willingness to sign his own name. Saintsbury proclaims that publishing Les Chouans was how he \\"first emerged from the purgatory of anonymous hack-writing.\\" Still, revenues from the book were not sufficient to cover Balzac's modest living expenses. Although he never finished the other works intended to comprise Scenes from a Military Life, Balzac returned to the people and politics of Les Chouans in later works. Corentin reappears in his 1841 novel Une t√©n√©breuse affaire (A Murky Business), and Hulot is featured in 1843's La Muse du d√©partement (The Provincial Muse). Later novels mention additional royalist uprisings, connecting them thematically to Les Chouans.Crawford, pp. 23‚Äì24. As a literary work, the novel is not singled out by critics from the rest of La Com√©die Humaine. Balzac's emerging style (some time before he refined his renowned realist idiom) and unsteady pacing are representative of his early career. Still, critics hail it as a turning point and it has even been called \\"a strong favorite\\" among readers. Adaptations In 1947 the novel was adapted into a French film, The Royalists, directed by Henri Calef, and starring Paul Amiot and Roland Armontel. Alain Vanzo adapted it into an opera, premiered in Avignon in 1982.

His name means either \\"the man from the forest zone\\" or \\"the forest-barker/wolf\\". Vidigoia figured during the campaigns of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great across the Danube around 330 AD. Having been driven from the Danube by the Romans, the Thervingi began infiltrating the Tisza Sarmatians. Vidigoia was probably the leader of this infiltration. Herwig Wolfram designates Vidigoia, along with Geberic, as one the first reiks, who were military kings emerging among the Goths at this time. The Gothic advance into Sarmatian territory led to a confrontation in 332 AD. Quoting Priscus, the Gothic historian Jordanes states that Vidigoia perished in this battle \\"by the guile of the Sarmatians\\". Though Vidigoia died, the battle was a success for the Thervingi. They were however later decisively defeated by Constantine II the same year. A treaty between the Thervingi and the Roman Empire was thereafter made by Ariaric and Constantine. Vidigoia was buried at the place of his death. Jordanes refers to him as the \\"bravest of the Goths\\". Centuries later Vidigoia was among the heroes the Goths celebrated in their songs, along with Eterpamara, Hanala and Fritigern. In the 5th century AD, when the Roman diplomat Priscus was traveling to the court of the Hunnic ruler Attila, his delegation visited the grave of Vidigoia. Vidigoia is thought to be one of the inspirations for the Germanic hero Witege.

It is located on the second floor of the south-most wing of the St. La Salle Hall, the oldest building of the university. The chapel was designed in art deco style by the commissioned architect, Tom√°s Map√∫a. Built in the 1930s, the chapel pews were hewn from narra and carried the Signum Fidei Star, the sign of faith and the symbol of the La Salle Brothers. On February 12, 1945, during the liberation of Manila at the peak of World War II, retreating Japanese troops massacred 41 civilians inside the chapel as they sought refuge from the ongoing battle, believing that the building's thick walls would protect them from anything but a direct hit.Carlos Quirino. La Salle: 1911‚Äì1986. Filipinas Foundation, Inc. 1986. On December 2, 2014, the 75th year jubilee of the Chapel of the Most Blessed Sacrament was celebrated, with a mass presided by a De La Salle University alumnus, Rev. Fr. Benildus Maramba, OSB. History = Construction= Even before De La Salle College moved to its present location at Taft Avenue in Malate, Manila, the school already had its own chapel. Its first chapel was opened on March 19, 1912, a year after the school opened its doors to 100 students in Calle Nozaleda, Paco, Manila. When the school transferred to Taft Avenue, it needed to build a new chapel. On March 22, 1926, Br. Basilian and Br. Anthony were sent to Iloilo, Cebu, and Mindanao to solicit funds for the construction of the new chapel. On November 17, 1926, the church was completed and dedicated to St. Joseph. President Manuel L. Quezon and his wife attended this occasion. =The February 12, 1945 Massacre= On February 12, 1945, a Japanese military officer along with 20 soldiers forcibly made their way into the college, which was then a refuge for 70 people, including 30 women and young girls, 16 Christian Brothers and the college's chaplain-Redemptorist Father Cosgrave CSSR, and the adult men of two families. The then De La Salle College Director-Brother Egbert Xavier FSC was about two days earlier forcibly taken by a group of Japanese soldiers and was never seen again. The Japanese soldiers herded these people into the school chapel where they were subsequently shot, slashed, or bayoneted. Those who did not die in the attack would be later be left to bleed to death and the Japanese attempted to violate the women who were dying from their wounds. The chapel was then set on fire and only ten of the victims would survive. This event was memorialized by a historical marker installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines on February 12, 2020, 75 years after the Liberation of Manila and the end of the Second World War in the Philippines. =Post-war restoration= On December 16, 1946, a written permission was received from Archbishop O' Doherty to have the reconciliation ceremony and the re-dedication of the Chapel to the Most Blessed Sacrament. On December 20, 1947, the Chapel was officially blessed. A ceremony of reparation to the Blessed Sacrament took place for the desecrations perpetrated in the chapel, and for the excesses in the name of war. The chapel was maintained and renovated. The original panes in the glass doors were of pre-war vintage, imported, and had, over the years, been patched with varicolored substitutes. This led to a second battle cry, Relieve a Pane. Now, uniform glass adorns the Chapel's doors. The De La Salle Alumni Association has donated four million pesos for the renovation of the chapel in the year 2000. It restored the chapel to its original splendor. The stained glass stations were cleaned and polished to their original beauty. In the process newly added stations were incorporated. The sanctuary was beautified with narra parquet extensions. The statues were restored and brought back to their original home on the small altars. The rose window above the main altar was backlit and the crucifix in the cupola was bathed in a soft halogen light.

Being both a practical photographer and a professional printer helped put him in the forefront of inventors who were striving to perfect a photo-engraving process. At age 54, in 1892 he died at his home in Brooklyn, leaving behind his wife Mary and one son.Obituary, The Publishers‚Äô Weekly Vol. XLI January to June, 1892 =Invention and career= Moss studied the work of Nic√©phore Niepce (1765‚Äì1833), a French doctor who produced the world‚Äôs first photograph in 1826. He also mastered the technique of L.J.M Daguerre, a Frenchman who joined with Niepce to produce, in 1835, what became known as the first daguerreotype photograph, and which was followed by the worldwide commercial success of daguerreotypes. A daguerreotype was made by exposing a polished silvered copper plate to an iodine vapor, which left a thin coat of light sensitive silver iodide on the copper. The plate was then placed over heated mercury, and the vapor combined with the silver particles to create an image. Sodium thiosulphate fixed the image. The weakness in the process came from the fact that the finished photograph had to be framed behind sealed glass to prevent oxidation of the silver, which would cause the photograph to deteriorate. Each image was unique and no copy could be made. This was largely why the daguerreotype became obsolete within 20 years of its invention. Another inventor, William Henry Fox Talbot, an Englishman, took the development a step further by inventing the world‚Äôs first multi-copy photographic process in 1841. He also used material sensitized with silver iodide. More progress was made by others, and in 1852 Fox Talbot patented a prototype of photo-engraving. But finding a workable solution for the mass production of photographs and text printed on an ordinary printing press remained out of reach. This failure of technology became of particular interest as photography itself made great advances‚Äîillustrated by Mathew Brady‚Äôs work during the 1860s, in the American Civil War. After another inventor tried but failed to etch a daguerreotype plate with electricity, Moss made a galvanic battery and began experiments that led in 1863 to the discovery of his photo-engraving process. It had taken him five years of relentless work. This was Moss‚Äô eureka! moment, although there were still problems to be resolved. Realizing the value of his invention, he and Mary moved in 1863 to New Jersey and then to New York City with dreams of making their fortune. According to Benson J. Lossing ‚ÄúHis wife stood by him with willing hands and an unswerving faith, while all his relatives tried to persuade him to abandon his hopeless and impoverishing quest.‚ÄùFor a detailed personal account of John C. Moss and his wife Mary see The History of New York (1884) by Benson J. Lossing, pages 842-846. It was Mary who persisted in repeating an experiment one night after Moss gave up and fell into bed with exhaustion. ‚ÄúHad not that experiment succeeded,‚Äù Moss wrote Lossing, ‚Äúthe Moss process might never had been heard of.‚Äù In 1875, Scientific American described what happened to Moss and his wife for the next eight years: \\"There are some inventions which, though of great value, are slow in winning their way to public favor. This proved to be one of them. There existed in the minds of many publishers a strong prejudice against process engraving because several processes had been introduced, of which they had made trial with very unsatisfactory results. Time was required to prove that Moss‚Äô process was not like the others.Scientific American 1845-1908; September 18, 1875; Vol. XXXIII; No. 12; pg. 178; Library of Congress, APS Online. Perhaps an even greater obstacle arose from the opposition of wood engravers and the reluctance of artists to change their style of drawing to fit this new art. The wood engravers feared‚Äîquite rightly, as it turned out‚Äîthat Moss‚Äô invention would decimate their profession. The artists did not favor Moss because they were accustomed to sketching their drawings quickly with pencil and brush, leaving the finished work to be done by the slow and tedious toil of the wood engraver. Moss‚Äô process required that they spend enough time to complete their drawings, which would then be photographed. In the face of active opposition by wood engravers and the yawning indifference of publishers, Moss and his wife struggled in their home-workshop under penurious circumstances for eight years, attracting few clients, until they finally found several backers willing to invest in a new company devoted to photo- engraving. =Commercialization= Advertisement by the Moss Photo-Engraving Company.

Actinic Engraving Company The Actinic Engraving Company was formed in 1871 in New York City. Michael George Duignan, who was one of Moss‚Äô first backers, had published a massive work of a quarter million words in 1862, entitled Positive Facts without a Shadow of Doubt, which showed him to be an eccentric visionary with theories ranging from religion to philosophy to international affairs. One chapter of his book was‚Äîperhaps facetiously‚Äîtitled ‚ÄúHow to Torment Your Wife.‚ÄùMichael G. Duignan‚Äôs book Positive facts without a shadow of a doubt is in the Library of Congress. Positive facts without a shadow of a doubt, 2nd edition, New York, 1862 Duignan urged the Actinic Company to make its national debut by publishing the first photo-engraved copy of the American Declaration of Independence. Facsimiles of the Declaration of Independence had been popular from the 1820s until the 1850s and the outbreak of the Civil War. One in eight American families had a Declaration framed on the wall of their homes. The most famous facsimiles were produced by two competing entrepreneurs, John Binns and Benjamin Tyler. Duignan obtained the John Binns facsimile of an ornamental Declaration of Independence, published in 1819, and gave it to Moss to be photo-engraved. Duignan deleted John Binns' name from the original dedication which appears at the bottom of the document and inserted his own name. He also deleted Binns' notice of copyright: \\"Entered according to Act of Congress the 4th of November 1818 by John Binns of the State of Pennsylvania.\\" Thus, Duignan falsely filed for a copyright in his own name and the copyright was granted. In June 1872, two months later, Moss dissolved the Actinic Engraving Company and started over without Duignan. Moss later claimed rights to the improved photo-engraving process he developed in May 1872 but he made no mention of the facsimile of the Declaration of Independence he created during that period. Moss Photo-Engraving Company Moss found a more amenable investor and in 1873 founded the Moss Photo-Engraving Company. Scientific American and Puck and other periodicals gave him contracts that paved the way for success. He invented new machinery and techniques to speed up the process of photo-engraving. By the early 1880s, according to Lossing, his 200 employees were annually turning out an amount of work that would have required at least 2,000 wood engravers. Moss photo- engraved original work, but a large part of his business consisted of reproducing woodcut and lithographic prints for mass production. Thanks to Moss, America became the leader in the world for mass-producing periodicals and books that contained actual photographs instead of wood-engraved drawings. Moss Engraving Company Desiring to be, finally, the sole master of his own company and inventions, Moss left the Photo-Engraving Company in 1880 and established the Moss Engraving Company, which was also a success. He died twelve years later. Rediscovery Moss‚Äô process was enhanced over the years by continuing innovations such as Frederick E. Ives‚Äô invention in 1886 of half-tone engraving for newspaper photographs. His legacy appears today on everything from postcards to coffee table books. For 400 years before Moss‚Äô invention, publications used wood engravings for illustrations, a labor- intensive process done by hand that did not lend itself to mass production. Moss turned out to be an extraordinary inventor but a hard-luck businessman with not much talent for self-promotion. He received little recognition for his invention during his lifetime, except from colleagues in the printing and publishing industry. Moss was rediscovered in 2009 by two art experts, Willis Van Devanter and Will StappWillis Van DevanterWill Stapp when they were asked to examine an unknown facsimile of the Declaration of Independence which Moss had created in 1872 with his new photo-engraving process. The document, which was found in a Paris antique shop, was thought to be possibly the only remaining copy in existence. This is detail from the original John Binns DOI showing that Binns signed his name after the dedication. The dedication reads in full: ‚ÄúTo the People of the United States this ornamented copy of the Declaration of Independence is respectfully dedicated by their fellow citizen John Binns This is detail from the Moss DOI showing that Michael Duignan deleted John Binns‚Äô name from the dedication and signed his own name.

Terry had a wide-ranging and eclectic career that reflected his many interests. Though primarily a journalist, he was also an ordained minister in the Church of the Disciples of Christ, and worked as a radio and television commentator, public lecturer, and advertising executive. He taught journalism at Howard University and The College of William & Mary, where he sat on the board of trustees. Early life Terry was born in New York City and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he was an editor of the Shortridge Daily Echo, one of the few high-school dailies in America. As a reporter for The Brown Daily Herald, he interviewed Orval Faubus, the outspoken segregationist governor of Arkansas, and gained national attention when a photograph of him shaking hands with Faubus hit the front page of The New York Times on September 14, 1957. Later, Terry became the newspaper's editor-in-chief, and the first African American to run an Ivy League newspaper. He did graduate studies in theology as a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of Chicago, and in international relations as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University. Career Terry was hired by the Washington Post in 1960, when he was just 19; three years later, he was hired by Time magazine. In 1967, Terry left for Vietnam, where he became the magazine's deputy bureau chief in Saigon and the first black war correspondent on permanent duty. During his two-year tour, he covered the Tet Offensive, flew scores of combat missions with American and South Vietnamese pilots, and joined assault troops in the Ashau Valley and on Hamburger Hill. He and New Republic correspondent Zalin Grant retrieved the bodies of four newsmen killed by the Viet Cong on May 5, 1968, during the Mini-Tet Offensive in Saigon, following directions from ambush survivor Frank Palmos and New Zealand military personnel. Terry's 1967 Time cover story, \\"The Negro in Vietnam\\", enjoyed a huge success, and he vowed that he would one day write a book about the sacrifices of black soldiers in Vietnam. His wife, Janice, a former schoolteacher who was his close collaborator, later wrote: > For Wally, getting his book published became an obsession, a shadowy thing > that was like another heartbeat in our household. It sat with us at the > dinner table. It watched the evening news with us. It went with us to the > movies, to church, to the grocery store. After thirteen years, we had sent > the manuscript to a hundred publishers‚Äîand received a hundred rejections. Finally, there was a breakthrough. The book Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans was published in June 1984 by Random House () and became a national bestseller. \\"And that shadowy thing in our lives finally disappeared\\", Janice Terry wrote. The New York Times wrote that \\"many of the individuals featured in [the book's] pages speak about their experiences with exceptional candor and passion; and in doing so, give the reader a visceral sense of what it was like, as a black man, to serve in Vietnam and what it was like to come back to 'the real world.'\\" Terry wrote and narrated the only documentary recording from the Vietnam battlefields, Guess Who's Coming Home: Black Fighting Men Recorded Live in Vietnam, which was released by Motown in 1972 and re-released independently in 2006 as a CD. He wrote and narrated the PBS Frontline show, \\"The Bloods of Nam\\", the Mutual Broadcasting show Marching to Freedom, which won an NEA citation and the Edward R. Murrow Brotherhood Award from B'nai B'rith. In 1992, Terry became the first J. Saunders Redding Visiting Fellow at Brown University. In 2000, the Brown University Alumni Magazine named him one of 100 graduates who made the greatest contributions to the 20th century. Death and legacy Wallace and Janice Terry In 2003, Terry developed a rare vascular disease called granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which strikes about one in a million people. The disease can be treated with drugs, but in his case it was diagnosed too late. He died under treatment at a Fairfax, Virginia, hospital on May 29, 2003. He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Janice Terry (n√©e Jessup), and by their three children: Tai, Lisa, and David, and two grandchildren: Noah and Sophia. At the time of his death, Terry was working on Missing Pages: Black Journalists of Modern America: An Oral History. The book was published posthumously in June 2007 to wide praise. Pulitzer Prize winner Cynthia Tucker called it a \\"treasure trove of history\\" in the May/June 2007 issue of the Columbia Journalism Review.

The castle overlooks Loch Linnhe and Bernera Island. The ruins are thought to date back to the thirteenth century. Achanduin Castle had long been thought to have been built by the Bishop of Argyll, though recent research has proved this to be unlikely. The castle was likely built by the MacDougalls around 1290 who held it throughout the fourteenth century. The castle was also thought to have been held by the Bishops of Argyll until the mid sixteenth century. It is a scheduled ancient monument. Description of the ruins The remains of the castle are seated on the summit of a limestone ridge on the north-western shore of Lismore. The south-west and south-east walls are collapsed though the north-east and a large part of the north-west wall still stand, to a maximum height of 6.7 metres. These curtain walls vary in thickness from 1.4 to 2.4 metres and enclose an area of about 22 metres square. The enclosed area would have contained at least two ranges of buildings on either side of a small courtyard, the south-east range being the more substantial. During excavations of the site in 1970 and 1971, two doorways were found leading from the courtyard into the north-west range. History Throughout the thirteenth century the Diocese of Argyll and the see of Lismore were in virtual poverty. It had once been thought that the Bishop of Argyll was the builder of Achanduin Castle, though recent research shows that neither the see or the Bishop at any time were wealthy enough to construct a castle. Recent research has points to the MacDougalls. Archaeological excavations show that Achanduin Castle was built about 1290, at a time when the Bishop of Argyll, Laurence de Ergadia, was himself possibly a MacDougall. The first documentary evidence of the castle appears in a grant of lands dated 1304 at Achichendone, when Eugenil de Ergadia, Lord of Lorn, of Menderaloch and of Lesmor granted to Andrew, Bishop of Argyll lands next to the castle. This grant shows that Achanduin Castle was in the hands of a MacDougall at that time. The MacDougalls were forfeit in 1308, and losing most of their lands following the Battle of the Pass of Brander and the loss of their stronghold of Dunstaffnage Castle. Of records concerning their redistributed possessions, Lismore is never mentioned. Therefore, it is possible that the MacDougalls were then allowed to retain the island. Archaeological evidence suggests that there was little occupation at the castle from c.1400 to relatively modern times. In 1451 John Maol (John Alani de Lorn nominato Mak Dowil) was granted Dunolly and other lands from John Stewart, Lord of Lorn. Around this time it is believed the MacDougalls left Lismore for the mainland to build Dunollie Castle. By 1452 The Bishop of Argyll seems to have had possession of Achanduin Castle and for a short time occupied it. It is suggested that the castle may have been given to the Bishopric at an earlier time, though there was not much use for it. The evidence shows at least that the Bishop of Argyll did not frequently visit Lismore.

The trail continued across the Panhandle along the Canadian into New Mexico where it met an existing trail south out of Santa Fe to El Paso and west into California. The peak number of emigrants from the eastern United States to California was about twenty thousand on this route in 1849.

Currently being a member of the Northern Sydney and Beaches Hockey Association The Men's teams have featured many Australian representatives over the years, including Kookaburras Brent Livermore, Jamie Dwyer, Matthew Butturini and Mark Knowles. Whereas the Women's teams Include Hockeyroos Murphy Allendorf, Grace Jeffery and Anna Flanagan. Also featuring up-and-coming representatives Brinley Gallagher and Robbie MacLennan (Burras), plus NSW Pride representatives Sarah Johnston and Emma Spinks The current GNS 1st Grade team consists of stars such as Isaac Priddis, Robbie Campbell, Quentin Pursey and Will McLean, all known for not only their skills but their good looks and charm around the club. In 2020 GNS's Men's portion of the club has combined with Manly Hockey Club's mens department to better meet the Sydney Hockey Association's New Premier League structure to play in the PL1, PL2 and PL3 competitions, run by SHA.  History  Today's Gordon North Sydney Hockey Club was a result of many mergers, occurring over the past century. North Sydney District Hockey Club was a dominant Men's hockey club in Sydney throughout the 1970s and 1980s, having all 7 men's team playing in the Grand Finals in 1979. It itself was a merger of North Sydney Police Boys Club and Cremorne-North Sydney Hockey Club in 1953, and later including Mosman Hockey Club in 1959‚Äì60. Gordon Hockey Club believed to be founded in the 1920s was also a merger, playing under the banner of Gordon-Wahroongah Hockey Club from 1952 until 1991 as it became incorporated. Its highest team was the current-day equivalent of PL2, known then as Premier B or Sydney Cup. Hence, in 1991 Gordon North Sydney Hockey Club emerged from the Merger of North Sydney District Hockey Club and Gordon Hockey Club, as North Sydney wasn't getting appraisal or help from the local council towards a future commitment to club infrastructure like a potential artificial turf field and declining player numbers, whereas Gordon had the newly built Ku-ring-gai Hockey Centre with increasing player numbers but still yet to crack the top Men's and Women's grades - To which the merger provided a top men's team for all. In 2007, the Gordon North Sydney 1st Grade Women's side finally cracked the promotion into the top grade of competition in Sydney, 11 years later (2018) having won their first-ever 1st Grade women's Premiership  Success and Performance  Gordon North Sydney Hockey Club and their respective mergers have had a host of success since their inception(s), across a variety of awards: * Gordon North Sydney HC's 1st Grade Women side winning the 2018 1st Grade Premiership (1st Title) * North Sydney District Hockey Club winning the 1st Grade Premiership in 1979, and Mosman Hockey Club in both 1929 and 1932 * North Sydney District HC winning the 2nd Grade Premierships (Pilgrim Trophy) in 1984, 1982, 1980, 1977‚Äì78, 1975, and Mosman HC in 1938 * North Sydney District HC winning the 3rd Grade Premierships (JW Taylor Trophy) in 1984 and 1977, and Cremorne-North Sydney HC in 1952 * North Sydney District HC winning the 4th Grade Premiership (Ron Willington Trophy) in 1985 * Gordon North Sydney HC winning the 5th Grade Mens Premiership (Sydney League 1) in 2011, Gordon HC in 1995-96 and North Sydney District HC in 1986 and 1984 * Gordon North Sydney HC winning the 6th Grade Mens Premierships (Sydney League 2) in 2012 and 2001, and Gordon HC in 1995 * Gordon North Sydney HC winning the 7th Grade Mens Premierships (Sydney League 3/JA Pearce Cup) in 2006-07 * Gordon North Sydney HC winning the 9th Grade Mens Premierships (Sydney League 5/R Skone Trophy) in 2010‚Äì11, and North Sydney District HC in 1987-88 * North Sydney District HC winning the PL1&2 Club Premierships in 1984-85 and 1979 (Co-inciding with the 1st Grade Premiership) * Gordon North Sydney HC winning the PL3&4 Club Premiership in 2001 * North Sydney District HC winning the SL1&2 Club Premierships in 1987-88 and 1966, Gordon-Wahroongah HC in 1967, and Gordon North Sydney HC in 2012 * Gordon HC winning the SL3&4 Club Premiership in 1981, and Gordon-Wahroongah HC in 1980 References External links * GNS Hockey official website Australian field hockey clubs Sporting clubs in Sydney North Sydney, New South Wales ","title":"Gordon-North Sydney Hockey Club"},{"id":"12806803","text":"Carl Eugene Zamloch (October 6, 1889 ‚Äì August 19, 1963) was an American baseball player, manager, and coach, and magician. The son of famed magician Anton Zamloch, he performed as a boy in his father's vaudeville magic act. He then played professional baseball player for 20 years, principally as a right- handed pitcher, between 1911 and 1930, including one season in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers in 1913. He compiled a 1‚Äì6 win‚Äìloss record and a 2.45 earned run average (ERA) in the major leagues. In nine minor league seasons for which records are available, he appeared in 154 games with a 25‚Äì25 record. For 13 seasons from 1916 to 1917 and 1919 to 1928, he compiled a 146‚Äì91‚Äì7 record as the head baseball coach for the University of California Golden Bears baseball team. Zamloch also served as the manager of the Twin Falls Bruins in 1926 and the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League from 1930 to 1932. He was also a part owner of the Oaks from 1929 to 1934. He also performed for much of his life as a magician. Early years Zamloch was born in Oakland, California, in 1889. His father Anton Zamloch was one of the most famous magicians (performing under the name \\"Zamloch the Great\\" and \\"Professor Zamloch\\") in the late 19th century and early 20th century. As a boy, Zamloch was the assistant in his father's magic act. Baseball career =Playing career= Zamloch began playing professional baseball in 1910, at age 19, as a left fielder for a team in San Leandro, California. He played in 1911 for the Sacramento Sacts and the San Francisco Seals, both of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). In 1912, he played for the Missoula, Montana team in the Union Association, appearing in 58 games. In October 1912, Zamloch was sold to the Detroit Tigers. He made his major league debut with the Tigers on May 7, 1912, and appeared in his last major league game two months later on July 9, 1913. He appeared in a total of 17 major league games, 12 as a relief pitcher and five as a starter. His adjusted ERA+ was 119, and he ranked 10th in the American League with 11 games finished in 1913. Although his major league career ended in 1913, he continued to play in the minor leagues for several additional years, including stints with the Denver Bears of the Western League in 1914, the Albuquerque Dukes of the Rio Grande Association in 1915, the Spokane Indians of the Northwestern League and Oakland Oaks of the PCL in 1917, Alameda of the Mission League in 1918, the San Francisco Seals of the PCL in 1919, the Seattle Rainiers of the PCL in 1920, the Calgary Stampeders in the Western International League in 1922, the Twin Falls Bruins (as player- manager) in 1926, and the Oakland Oaks for two final games in 1930. In his later years as a player, Zamloch served as a utility player. The San Francisco Chronicle in 1919 described him as \\"a valuable utility man, for he can pitch, play the infield or outfield, and he is a pretty fair hitter.\\" In nine minor league seasons for which records are available, he appeared in 154 games and compiled a 25‚Äì25 win-loss record as a pitcher. =College coaching and military service= In February 1916, Zamloch was hired to coach the California Golden Bears baseball team. He continued to serve as Cal's head baseball coach from 1916 to 1917 and 1919 to 1928. For several years, he coached Cal through their season which ended in April and then played minor league baseball for the balance of the spring and summer months. In 1917, he attempted to enlist in the United States Army following the United States' entry into World War I, but he was rejected because of the condition of his leg which had been broken three times during his baseball career. He served as the baseball coach at the University of Montana in late 1917. In January 1918, and although his enlistment had been rejected for medial reasons, he received an appointment as an athletic instructor to the Army under the supervision of the Young Men's Christian Association and was initially assigned to Fort Sam Houston in Texas. He was later appointed as the athletic director at the Presidio of San Francisco, training soldiers in basketball and indoor baseball. Zamloch was released from the Army in January 1919. He returned to Cal, and during his 13-year tenure as Cal's baseball coach, his teams had a record of 146‚Äì91‚Äì7. In 1928, while coaching at Cal, he gained attention for developing \\"reversible baseball\\" which allowed a batter to run the bases in either direction (starting at first or at third base), provided that if there was already a man on base, subsequent batters had to run in the same direction chosen by the man already on base. He was also the coach of the California Golden Bears soccer team from 1925 to 1931, and during Zamloch's time as head coach, the soccer team had a record of 34‚Äì17‚Äì7. He worked as an insurance salesman, and later as a stock broker, when he was not coaching. =Oakland Oaks= In October 1929, Zamloch and two others, A. Robert Miller and Victor Devincenzi, purchased the Oakland Oaks baseball team in the Pacific Coast League from J. Cal Ewing for a price estimated to be close to $500,000. As part of the acquisition, it was agreed that Zamloch would leave his position with the University of California and take over as the manager of the Oaks. His resignation as a coach at the university was accepted in early December 1929. Zamloch served as the team's manager for three years, leading the Oaks to a 91‚Äì103 in 1930, an 86‚Äì101 record in 1931, and an 80‚Äì107 in 1932. After the 1932 season, Zamloch was removed as the manager of the Oaks. He also became involved in litigation with his former co-owners over claims that he failed to share a commission for the purchase of the club in 1929 and that he was owed salary for his service as the club's manager. In December 1934, Zamloch sold his stock in the Oaks to Victor Devincenzi. Professional magician Zamloch also worked and performed as a magician for many years. While coaching at the University of California in the late 1920s, he worked as a stock broker in the morning, coached baseball in the afternoon, and performed his magic act in the evenings. Zamloch reportedly was also adept at using \\"a bit of magic\\" as an ice-breaker in starting discussions with baseball prospects. After his baseball career was over, Zamloch performed his magic act at schools, clubs, and other events. His acted included sleight of hand, card tricks, a spirit show, slate writing and cabinet tests, a mysterious trunk, a mailbag escape, driving a car on public street while blindfolded and guided by a \\"psychic sense,\\" his father's Hindu rope trick, Houdini's needle and thread trick, the Egyptian fire trick, a Chinese silk and water feat, vanishing pigeons, and the mystery of the six boxes. In 1937, he published a book, \\"17 Simple but Mystifying Tricks to Entertain Your Friends\\", under the pseudonym \\"The Great Zam.\\" Later years From 1936 until his death in 1963, he worked as a sales executive and legislative consultant for the Signal Oil and Gas Company. He died in August 1963 at age 73 in Santa Barbara, California. He had been hospitalized at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital for several weeks after suffering a stroke on July 3, 1963. He was buried at Sunset View Cemetery in El Cerrito, California.

Anne McDonald (11 January 1961 ‚Äì 22 October 2010) was a nonverbal Australian person with cerebral palsy and severe intellectual disability who was one of the first subjects of the scientifically discredited facilitated communication (FC) technique. McDonald was credited as an author and activist despite not having a legitimate means of communication. The Anne McDonald Centre, which promotes the use of facilitated communication, is named after her. Early life McDonald was born on 11 January 1961 in Seymour, Victoria. As a result of a birth injury, she developed athetoid cerebral palsy and severe intellectual disability. She could not walk, talk or feed herself. At the age of three, she was placed by her parents in St. Nicholas Hospital, Melbourne, a Health Commission (government) institution for children with severe disabilities, where she was neglected and starved. At age 16 she weighed only 12 kilograms (26 pounds). In 1977, when McDonald was 16, Rosemary Crossley claimed that she was able to communicate with her by supporting her upper arm while she selected word blocks and magnetic letters. Crossley continued using similar strategies with McDonald and other individuals with disabilities, developing what has become known as facilitated communication training. Through Crossley, McDonald appeared to seek discharge from St. Nicholas, her parents and the hospital authorities denied her request on the grounds that the reality of her communication had not been established. In 1979, when McDonald turned eighteen, a habeas corpus action in the Supreme Court of Victoria was commenced against the Health Commission in order to win the right to leave the institution. The court accepted that McDonald's communication was her own and allowed her to leave the hospital and live with Crossley. Patricia Margaret Minnes objected with the following statement: > However in my opinion the results of this assessment cannot be considered > objectively reliable and valid until such time as Anne is shown to perform > at a similar intellectual level under experimentally controlled conditions. > In my view there are at least three variables which need to be controlled, > namely ‚Äì (a) the nature of support to Anne's arm, (b) the amount of > information available to the supporting person regarding the response > requested of Anne, and (c) the nature of Anne's responses. In my opinion > these factors can be controlled and until the assessment is made under > objectively reliable experimental conditions in my opinion the results of > Mr. Healey's assessment cannot be taken as conclusive. Career Despite her inability to communicate, McDonald was given a Higher School Certificate (University entrance) qualification from a night school and a humanities degree from Deakin University for coursework completed through facilitated communication. She was also credited as a co-author of the book Annie's Coming Out (1980). The book won the inaugural Allen Lane Award for the best book of the year dealing with disability. The film Annie's Coming Out, based on the book, won several Australian Film Institute awards (including Best Picture) and was released in the US under the title Test of Love. On the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, 3 December 2008, McDonald was given the Personal Achievement Award in the Australian National Disability Awards at Parliament House. Death and legacy McDonald died of a heart attack on 22 October 2010. She received a posthumous award from the Australian Group on Severe Communication Impairment (AGOSCI).  Controversy  The story of McDonald's use of facilitated communication has been questioned by skeptics, as the technique has been proven invalid through scientific research. Psychologists and policy makers have argued facilitated communication is, at best, ineffective wishful thinking, and at worst, actively harmful. McDonald and her story have reappeared in the news following the sexual assault case against facilitated communication aide Anna Stubblefield.

The Nietzsche Archive was founded in 1894 in Naumburg, Germany, and found a permanent location at Weimar. Its history until the middle of the 20th century was closely tied to its founder and chief for many years, Elisabeth F√∂rster- Nietzsche, the philosopher's sister. Though from its inception the archive came under much criticism for doctoring, or even forging, documents to support certain ideological purposes, the Archive was, until the end of the Second World War, a location of central importance for Nietzsche's reception in Germany. In the GDR it was affiliated with the Nationale Forschungs- und Gedenkst√§tten der klassischen deutschen Literatur in Weimar (National Research and Memorial Sites of Classical German Literature in Weimar), and formally dissolved in 1956. Its holdings were made accessible for western researchers, most notably Mazzino Montinari, who replaced the dubious old Archiv's Nietzsche editions with new ones. In the GDR, however, Nietzsche was still a forbidden author, with all of his works being banned. Since German reunification, the archive's holdings are in possession of the Stiftung Weimarer Klassik, now called the Klassik Stiftung Weimar. The archive's domicile, the Villa Silberblick, is now a museum.  History  = Objectives = Elisabeth F√∂rster planned the establishment of a Nietzsche Archive after returning to Germany from Paraguay in the Fall of 1893. The purpose of the archive was to collect resources to keep them from being scattered and to secure a monopoly over their value‚Äînot unusual at that time. From the beginning of the 1890s, the reception of Nietzsche's works in the German- speaking world grew enormously. The Nietzsche Archive attempted to attain the legal rights of interpretation of Friedrich Nietzsche and his philosophies in public discussions. Not only did Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche's biographies serve these discussions, but also a multitude of journals and newspaper articles which came from the archive and the surrounding areas. F√∂rster- Nietzsche had already collected documents from her admired brother since her youth and then began to buy up all of his mail correspondences for a substantial sum. These letters were therefore also published directly and indirectly by the archive alongside Nietzsche's works. Another reason for the publishing frenzy from the archive and its monopolization of Nietzsche's work might also have been to earn large profits from them.

Field Epidemiology. Oxford University Press. New York. 1996. A more expansive definition is: The practice of Epidemiology in the field. Work is done in communities often as a public health service and as part of government or a closely allied institution. Field epidemiology is how epidemics and outbreaks are investigated, and is used to implement measures to protect and improve the health of the public. Field epidemiologists must deal with unexpected, sometimes urgent problems that demand immediate solution. Its methods are designed to answer specific epidemiologic questions in order to plan, implement, and/or evaluate public health interventions. These studies consider the needs of those who will use the results. The task of a field epidemiologist is not complete until the results of a study have been clearly communicated in a timely manner to those who need to know, and an intervention made to improve the health of the people.Last JM. A Dictionary of Epidemiology. Fourth Edition. Oxford University Press. New York. 2001 Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs) are two-year applied public health training programs modeled after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS). FETPs are established within host country ministries of health to enhance the epidemiologic capacity of the public health workforce and increase the use of science and data to appropriately respond to public health threats. By developing the skills of the workers and reinforcing the health systems in which they work, FETPs also help countries to meet their core capacity requirements for surveillance and response under the revised International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). The guiding principle of the FETP training model is ‚Äúlearning through doing,‚Äù a concept that is analogous to a medical residency (in which physicians acquire on-the-job experience by learning and practicing the necessary skills to become capable clinicians); many FETP programs are however open to a wide range of health professional backgrounds, not only physicians. FETP trainees, or ‚Äúresidents,‚Äù spend approximately 25 percent of their time in the classroom, learning the principles of epidemiology, disease surveillance, outbreak investigation, and biostatistics. The other 75 percent of their time is spent in field placements, where residents \\"learn by doing,\\" by participating in outbreak investigations, helping to establish and evaluate disease surveillance systems, designing and conducting studies on problems of public health concern in their country, and training other healthcare workers. Field work is typically conducted under the supervision and guidance of an experienced mentor. FETP residents have been involved in initiatives to prevent and control infectious diseases of global health importance, including polio, cholera, tuberculosis, HIV, malaria, and emerging infectious diseases of animal origin (e.g., SARS, Nipah virus, and avian influenza). Many residents have also worked to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, or environmental or occupational health problems. Since launching the Epidemic Intelligence Service by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1951, the development of field epidemiology has been promoted internationally and globally. The first FETP outside of the United States was established by Canada in 1975.White FMM, A Perspective on the control of communicable diseases in Canada, Editorial. Can J Public Health 1976, 67: 449-53. In 1980, the government of Thailand requested CDC‚Äôs assistance to establish its own program, with funding initially contributed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Since then, CDC has helped to establish FETPs in 41 countries worldwide, which have produced more than 2,500 graduates from 61 countries. Over 80% of residents stay in their home countries, and many become leaders within their public health system. FETP Networks Many of the countries which participate in an FETP collaborate with the Training Programs in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET), a global network of Field and Applied Epidemiology Training Programs, to share resources and best practices. Regional FETP networks also exist, including: the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), the Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET), RedSur (the network of Latin American FETPs), and the South Asia Field Epidemiology and Technology Network (SAFETYNET). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has created the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET) in 1995. Its purpose was to create a network of highly trained field epidemiologists in the European Union, thereby strengthening the public health epidemiology workforce at EU Member States and EEA level. Current EPIET alumni are providing expertise in response activities and strengthening capacity for communicable disease surveillance and control inside and beyond the EU. In 2006 EPIET was integrated into the core activities of ECDC. The European Public Health Microbiology Training Programme (EUPHEM) was initiated by ECDC in 2008. The EUPHEM program a unique program. The objective of the public health microbiology path (EUPHEM) is to provide state-of-the-art training in public health microbiology enabling its fellows to apply microbiological and epidemiological methods to a wide range of public health problems in Europe. In 2016, EPIET and EUPHEM became the ECDC Fellowship Programme, consolidating in this way the alignment of administrative processes and core curricular aspects. EPIET has a very active alumni network (the EPIET Alumni Network; EAN) that was created in 2000 to help develop and maintain a network of European public health epidemiologists that have participated in the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET); it now also includes alumni from the European Programme for Public Health Microbiology Training (EUPHEM) and other European Field Epidemiology Training Programmes (FETP). As well as alumni of training programmes, the EAN also has some ‚Äòexternal‚Äô members who, through their work, meet similar objectives to the EAN. As the regular member surveys show, \\"having a network of professionals that know each other, speak the same 'language', and can easily access each other's expertise, represents an important resource for European and global public health, which should be nurtured by encouraging more collaborations devoted to professional development.\\" \\"Time, place, and people: composition of the EPIET Alumni Network and its contribution to the European public health resource in 2013.\\" Pezolli et al.

She is known for portraiture and history painting, and excelled in painting altarpieces. She was also involved in the foundation of one of the first female-organized schools of art during the sixteenth century. Born to painter Giovanni Filippo Criscuolo (died 1624); her uncle, Giovanni Angelo (Gian Angelo) was also a painter. She married the painter Giovanni Antonio di Amato the younger. Early life and education Mariangela Criscuolo was born c. 1548 in Naples, Italy. She was exposed to art at a young age as members of her family were already established Neapolitan artists. Her uncle, Giovanni Angelo Criscuolo (c. 1500- after 1577 Naples), was originally a notary that later became a painter. Her father, Giovanni Filippo Criscuolo (c. 1529 ‚Äì 1561), was also an artist in Naples, whose style was similar to followers of Raphael. The similarities in style in Mariangela‚Äôs work with that of her father makes him a probable source of her informal training in becoming a painter. Those similarities in style are more clearly illustrated in Giovanni Filippo‚Äôs Annunciation for San Paolo Maggiore in Naples and Mariangela‚Äôs depiction of the same scene for the parocchiale di Bucciano in Benevento. Career Mariangela worked to become a prominent female portraitist before being married to another artist, Giovanni Antonio d‚ÄôAmato (1535‚Äì1598). Later in her career, she turned to history painting, depicting many religious scenes, such as the Death of the Virgin and an altarpiece of the Virgin and Child with Saints. Another well known work by Mariangela is the Deposition from the Cross found in the church of San Servino in Naples. While still married to her husband, Mariangela also ran possibly the earliest documented female-organized informal school of art in Naples. She taught both female and male students. Although few of her male pupils reached great acclaim as it was perceived to be less impressive to learn from a female teacher. One of her suspected female pupils was Luisa Capomazza, who went on to take vows as a nun and paint for various churches in Naples. Death Mariangela‚Äôs date of death is unknown, but it is suspected that she died after 1598, when her husband died. Biography in 'Vite de‚Äô Pittori, Scultori ed Architetti Napoletani' Much of what is known about Mariangela Criscuolo is based on the biography written by Bernardo de Dominici (1683-1759 Naples) in his book, 'Vite de‚Äô Pittori, Scultori ed Architetti Napoletani' (Lives of the Neapolitan Painters, Sculptors, and Architects), published in three volumes between 1742 and 1745. In his biography of Mariangela, de Dominici references the unpublished compilation of Neapolitan artist biographies by Massimo Stanzione. De Dominici acknowledges Mariangela‚Äôs accomplishments as an artist and founder of an art school accepting both men and women. Adding to this, de Dominici also states that women were sent to her more to learn how to be good wives and Christians rather than good artists.

Sch√∂nemann regarded this work as resting on a conceptual confusion. Sch√∂nemann argued for the non-existence of psychometric g. He wrote that there is a fundamental difference between g, first defined by Charles Spearman as a latent one-dimensional variable that accounts for all correlations among any intelligence tests, and a first principal component (PC1) of a positive correlation matrix. Spearman's tetrad difference equation states a necessary condition for such a g to exist.Famous artefacts: Spearman's Hypothesis. Cahiers de Psychologie Cognitive / Current Psychology of Cognition, 16, 665‚Äì698: The important proviso for Spearman's claim that such a g qualifies as an \\"objective definition\\" of \\"intelligence\\", is that all correlation matrices of \\"intelligence tests\\" must satisfy this necessary condition, not just one or two, because they are all samples of a universe of tests subject to the same g. Sch√∂nemann argued that this condition is routinely violated by all correlation matrices of reasonable size, and thus, such a g does not exist.Psychometrics of Intelligence. K. Kemp-Leonard (ed.) Encyclopedia of Social Measurement, 3, 193‚Äì201: Twin studies In a number of publications, Sch√∂nemann argued that the statistical heritability estimates used in most twin studies rest on restrictive assumptions which are usually not tested, and if they are, often are found to be violated by the data.Sch√∂nemann, P.

Howard arrived in London from his native Australia in 1969, joining the band Caparius led by saxophonist Clive Stevens, alongside guitarist Peter Martin and bassist Neville Whitehead. The band's final line-up, in 1971, replaced Martin with future Isotope guitarist/leader Gary Boyle and pianist Dave MacRae. Howard first came to the attention of Soft Machine when Robert Wyatt left in August 1971 and auditions for a potential replacement were held. In the end, Wyatt changed his mind, but Softs saxophonist Elton Dean borrowed Howard and fellow Caparian Whitehead as the rhythm section in his extracurricular Just Us group. Both were featured on Dean's eponymous 1971 solo album, and both were also members of the Keith Tippett Group during this period. A live radio session by Soft Machine in March 1971, in which the Dean group participated, saw Howard reinforcing the Softs on one piece, the one instance of Wyatt and Howard drumming together. In August 1971, Wyatt left and Howard was drafted in at Dean's insistence, although the other members of the group had Nucleus drummer John Marshall in mind (but Marshall had just joined Jack Bruce's band). Howard played with the band on British and European tours during the Autumn, but he was fired after recording the first side of the album Fifth in December 1971. Mike Ratledge and Hugh Hopper thought the band was getting too free-form. Howard remained in Dean's group, now christened Just Us, for one more year, but his trail went cold after 1972, although there was one interesting postscript when, in typical Canterbury Scene fashion, he participated in the one-off Lol Coxhill- Richard Sinclair Quintet assembled for a French jazz festival in late 1975, alongside Dave MacRae and ex-East Of Eden violinist Dave Arbus. Liner notes for a late 1970s reissue of Fifth mentioned that he was last heard of working on a North Sea oil rig. None of his former musical associates know of his whereabouts.

He currently resides in Tagbilaran City, Bohol.  Early life  Bautista spent his early childhood in the fields, growing rice with his family. Craving to live a better and more successful life, he turned to boxing at a very young age. Bautista, at the time, was discovered by Nemi Monton (ABAP Region VII president and chair for Boxing Development of the Bohol PSC), who allowed the young Bautista to fight in amateur bouts, within the island province of Bohol. Fed up with poverty, Bautista turned pro just a week shy before his 17th birthday, hoping to find a better opportunity. =Early career at Bantamweight= On June 12, 2003, in the Gaisano Country Mall in Cebu, Philippines, Bautista made his professional debut. He won a shutout, unanimous decision (UD) through six rounds against Reyco Compendio. At only 17 years of age, Bautista showed much potential. After winning his next seven fights, Bautista compiled an undefeated record of eight wins, and 0 losses (8-0). With only eight fights under his belt, the young Bautista campaigned in Indonesia, South Korea, and Japan for his next three fights. Impressively, he won all three bouts. Bautista defeated Indonesian, Hengky Wuwungan when the referee stopped the fight to prevent Wuwungan from receiving any further damage. Bautista then faced South Korean, Hwi-Jong Kim, whom he defeated by a split decision (SD) through ten rounds. Then Bautista followed that up by traveling to Japan to defeat Hirokatsu Yamazaki, when the Japanese retired from the bout right after the third round. Following the Yamazaki fight, Bautista had the opportunity to fight for his first regional title. On August 17, 2004, in the Sports and Cultural Complex in Mandaue City, Cebu, Bautista defeated Thai fighter, Saensak Singmanasak by second-round TKO for the then vacant WBO Asia Pacific bantamweight title. Bautista defended that title once (against South African Vuyisile Bebe, whom he defeated by a UD through twelve rounds) before he got his first big break in the sport, a chance to show many others his true potential. =Super Bantamweight= On September 10, 2005, in the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Bautista fought in the undercard of Manny Pacquiao's and Erik Morales' respective fights with both H√©ctor Vel√°zquez and Zahir Raheem. The then undefeated Bautista was able to defeat his Colombian opponent (Felix Flores) by a third-round KO, impressing many people, which led to him fighting on U.S. soil for the majority of his next few fights. But before he was able to make his three fight campaign in the United States, Bautista needed to defend his WBO Asia Pacific bantamweight title from Tanzanian, Obote Ameme. Bautista was able to do just that, defeating Ameme by a second-round TKO. Three months later, Bautista started that three fight campaign by defeating Mexican, Gerardo Espinoza by a UD through eight rounds. Five months later, Bautista continued his success in the states by defeating Nicaraguan, Roberto Bonilla by KO in just three rounds. He finished off the successful \\"road-trip\\" by defeating Brazilian, Giovanni Andrade, after Andrade retired from the bout after 4 rounds of action. After one fight in the Philippines (where he defeated Mexican, Marino Montiel for the then vacant WBO Inter- Continental and Asia Pacific Youth super bantamweight titles), Bautista fought in The World Awaits undercard, when his promoter at the time, Oscar De La Hoya of Golden Boy Promotions, allowed Bautista to fight in the undercard of his bout against Floyd Mayweather. This was a big step in Bautista's career, since the fight was titled as a WBO Super Bantamweight Title Eliminator. On May 5, 2007, in the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, Bautista faced and defeated the then undefeated Argentine contender Sergio Manuel Medina (28-0) by UD. Bautista, although defeating Medina, too suffered a knockdown. On the eleventh round, \\"Medina clearly staggered Bautista with a solid combination and the Filipino held on to the ropes to apparently keep himself from going down\\". But nonetheless, \\"in the end, it was the unabated aggression of Bautista which accounted for the big margins on the scorecards of the judges, as he connected with several solid combinations to win most of the close rounds (of the bout)\\". The win gives Bautista his first world title shot, against the then WBO Super Bantamweight World Champion, Daniel Ponce de Le√≥n of Mexico. First and second career loss On August 11, 2007, in ARCO Arena in Sacramento, California, Bautista headlined the boxing World Cup staged by Golden Boy Promotions: Philippines vs. Mexico. Bautista, to the disappointment of the many Filipino fans in attendance that night, failed in his first attempt at a world title, when he suffered a first-round TKO loss to the hands of Daniel Ponce de Le√≥n, suffering his first ever loss as a pro. The Mexican proved to be too strong, knocking down Bautista twice in the first round, forcing the referee to stop the bout. On November 22, 2008, after administering three more wins to build his confidence following his first- round knockout loss to Ponce de Le√≥n, Bautista was vanquished by Heriberto Ruiz of Mexico, who had a record of (39-7-2) coming into the bout. Bautista lost by scores of 80-70, 78-72 and 77-73, all in favor of the Mexican. =Featherweight= Bautista and his handlers decided to move up one weight division, up to featherweight,. On October 16, 2009, Bautista made his long- awaited ring return. There, he took on respected Marangin Marbun of Indonesia, whom he defeated by a seventh-round TKO, awarding Bautista the then vacant interim WBC International Featherweight title, which he relinquished on January 19, 2010. Bautista fought Thailand's Saichon Sotornpitak for a 10-round non titled fight on April 24, 2010 in Dubai. The bout headlined the card \\"Philippines vs The Rest of the World, which is presented by KO Promotions in association with ALA Promotions. In this event, two other Filipino boxers, Milan Melindo and Larry Canillas, won their respective bout. Bautista stopped Sotornpitak in the sixth round and improved his record to 28-2, with 21 knockouts. On August 28, 2010, Bautista fought Mexico's Alejandro Barrera (cousin of Marco Antonio Barrera) at the Waterfront Cebu City Hotel in Cebu. The Filipino pugilist won the match by TKO in the 4th round, after the referee stopped the fight due to a bad cut over Barrera's left eye, caused by a punch. On January 29, 2011, the Filipino boxer knocked out Barrera in the third round of their rematch, which took place at the Cebu City Waterfront Hotel & Casino in Cebu, Philippines. Ruiz-Bautista Rematch June 12, 2011, after suffering a loss in 2008, Bautista defeated Ruiz by Technical decision. Rey 'Boom Boom' Bautista suffered three cuts due to head butts before the fight was stopped at 0:56 of the seventh round. Heriberto 'Cuate' Ruiz of Mexico effectively defused Bautista's aggressiveness with timely clinches, an effective jab and lateral movement in the early rounds. Just like in their first fight, Bautista was cut by a clash of heads in the third at the corner of his right eyebrow. Bautista continued to charge forward which resulted in heated exchanges. In the fifth, Ruiz' survival skills showed as he landed a low blow and effectively clinched. Another headbutt opened a cut on Bautista's scalp. Referee Danrex Tapdasan had a hard time controlling the extra-curricular activities. Bautista was surging and landed the cleaner and harder blows in the 5th and 6th rounds. Ruiz was fading but another clash of heads opened a cut on Bautista's right eyebrow. The ring physician, Dr. Jose Unabia, recommended the fight stoppage. The scores read ‚Äì Judge Bruce McTavish 69-65, Judge Muhamad Rois 68-65 and Judge Rey Danseco 68-65 all for Bautista. Bautista won the IBF International featherweight title but a section of the crowd voiced their displeasure. The sportswriters at ringside also had an animated discussion about the outcome. Per IBF rules, no points were deducted due to the headbutts.  WBO International featherweight title  On October 20 Bautista won against Daniel Ruiz for the vacant WBO International featherweight title via split decision. The fight took place at the Mall of Asia Arena and was headlined by Bautista's ALA teammate AJ Banal.  Retirement  Bautista attempted to defend the WBO International featherweight championship against Jos√© Ram√≠rez on April 20, 2013 but lost by split decision. Moments after the bout, he announced his retirement, but he returned for 2 more fights during 2014.  Post-boxing  Several days after his retirement, Bautista applied to become a boxing trainer for newcomers in the Philippine Air Force.

He was arrested and put in prison in 1963 but escaped and spent 30 years in exile in the United Kingdom. He was a senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Essex between 1972 and 1991 when he moved back to South Africa with his wife to direct the Education Policy Unit at the University of the Western Cape in Cape Town. White rule ended three years later. He died of a sudden heart attack in 1996.  Life  Harold Wolpe was born in 1926 in Johannesburg to a Lithuanian-Jewish family. He graduated from the Witwatersrand University with a BA in social science and an LLB. He married AnnMarie Kantor in 1955 and they had three children - Peta, Tessa and Nicholas. He was a leading member of the struggle against apartheid and a friend of both Joe Slovo and Nelson Mandela. His legal work was centrally connected with the South African struggles until his arrest in 1963 - much of it concerned with political detainees. He was an important member of the illegal South African Communist Party (SACP) and was engaged with the ANC (which was banned after the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960). He was arrested and imprisoned in 1963 but escaped and lived in exile in England for 30 years. He was senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Essex between 1972 and 1991, and Chair of the Department between 1983-1986. He moved back to South Africa with his wife in 1991 to direct the Education Policy Unit at the University of the Western Cape in Cape Town. White rule ended three years later. He died of a sudden heart attack in 1996. His wife has written a biography of her life throughout the time of the struggles - The Long Way Home (1994).  Work and politics  Wolpe is best known for the theory that cheap labour in South Africa was sustained by the articulation of capitalism with subsistence economies in rural areas. Workers could be paid at below social reproduction costs because the costs of social reproduction were being met in the parallel subsistence economy. Apartheid and other segregation regimes were kept in place to prevent the formation of a stable urban proletariat and ensure continued sub-reproduction labour costs, as those unable to work could be deported to the bantustans, and workers did not create stable families in the cities. This theory has been applied to explain low wages across the global South, including in Gayatri Spivak's theory of the expanded form of value. In a posthumous examination of his work, Dan O'Meara commented: :‚ÄúIt bears stating that Harold's Capitalism and Cheap Labour-Power article is probably the most influential and widely-cited theoretical text ever written on South Africa. Every sociology and politics student working on South Africa since, has been required to read this article, as have more than a few historians. Every critic of the South African neo-marxists has been obliged to begin their critique with this article. As the SACP noted in its statement on Harold's death, the article basically launched an entire new analytical paradigm on South Africa. But it did more than that. It alerted the newly emerging \\"school\\" of \\"revisionist\\" studies of South Africa to the absolute necessity of theory‚Äù Harold Wolpe remains for me the most important South African social scientist since 1945.

Born George Stucley Buck, he had assumed by Royal licence the surname of Stucley in lieu of his patronymic, on the death of his father, in 1858 as lineal representative of the ancient Stucley family. This family, which possessed Affeton Castle in Devon for over 600 years, originally came from the village of Stukeley in Huntingdonshire, and were sheriffs of that county during the reign of King John. The family are descended from Richard Stucley, of Trent, Somerset, and Elizabeth Fitzroger his wife. Their son, Hugh Stucley married Katherine Affeton, heiress of the Affeton estates, and was sheriff of Devon in 1448. The fifth Baronet served as a Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Devon.

In 2007, the inmates of Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC), a maximum security prison in Cebu, the Philippines, imitated the zombie dance featured in the music video of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\". The footage, uploaded onto video-sharing website YouTube, became a viral video. The idea behind the dance came from the prison's chief, Byron F. Garcia. Garcia first conceived the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit. Music was then added to provide additional motivation. The convicts marched and danced to several songs, including \\"In the Navy\\" and \\"Y.M.C.A.\\" by the Village People. Garcia posted the prisoners' dance regimes onto the internet in April 2007. The most popular of the presentations was their Thriller performance. The video showed over 1,500 male inmates emulating Michael Jackson's dance moves from the original Thriller short film. Jackson fan Crisanto Nierre played the role of the pop star, with the openly gay former pizza chef Wenjiel Resane playing his girlfriend. The video became one of the most viewed on the internet, receiving 300,000 views per day at its peak. As of November 12, 2016, the Thriller viral video has received over 57 million reported views. The clip also garnered complaints, with one professor stating that the dancing does not rehabilitate CPDRC inmates. The prison and its officers faced allegations of prisoner abuse, claims which both the officers and inmates denied. The prisoners have performed numerous other songs, including \\"Radio Ga Ga\\", \\"Together in Electric Dreams\\", \\"Holding Out for a Hero\\", and several songs from Sister Act. One of their performances involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the Dalai Lama, Pope John Paul II and Mahatma Gandhi. As a result of the prisoners' internet fame, many visitors come to CPDRC to view the monthly performances held by the convicts. Their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard. At the jail, visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates. They can also buy souvenir prison shirts.

The center is run by Byron F. Garcia, and its inmates are either facing trial or are serving sentences for crimes ranging from shoplifting to murder and rape. In 2007, more than 300 of the inmates were facing murder charges. Garcia initiated the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit. \\"While the goal is to keep the body fit in order to keep the mind fit, such may not happen if it is done in a manner deemed unpleasurable\\", Garcia said. Considering music to be \\"the language of the soul\\", Garcia added it to the prisoner's workout regime. Garcia also wanted the music workouts to be a way in which to break down gang factions amongst prison inmates. Melita Thomeczeck, the Philippine's deputy consulate general in New York, suspected that the warden added the music in order to take detainee's minds off of other matters. One of the first songs the prisoners worked with was Pink Floyd's \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\". Garcia had them march to the music as a bid to increase participation in exercise. Other early musical choices included \\"In the Navy\\" and \\"Y.M.C.A.\\" by the Village People. The Village People songs were chosen so that macho inmates \\"wouldn't be offended by being asked to dance\\". For Filipinos, music and dancing is said to be a way of life. Natives of the Philippines are reported to have a tendency to \\"sing and dance their way out of even the most complicated situations\\". Thomeczeck stated, \\"The Filipinos love music and they love to sing and dance. Whatever they are in a natural way, they can continue that habit in prison.\\" Despite other colleagues' enthusiasm about the dancing, chief administrator Patrick Rubio of the Directorate of Operations within the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology was worried about the volume of inmates dancing, as CPDRC was undermanned. Despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the center's Operations Manual, Rubio thought of the dance as a disaster waiting to happen. \\"As a jail officer, I got worried when I saw it\\", Rubio commented. The inmates were not fond of the idea either, pelting a visiting choreographer with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison. Prisoners eventually agreed to dance, but admitted that the routines took a while to master. \\"It was difficult at first, but eventually we inmates got used to it\\", inmate Mario Benito revealed. The program began as an experiment and, after six months, prison chiefs concluded that it was a successful one. Video and response In 2007, Garcia posted several videos of his inmates' performances on YouTube in hopes of inspiring other prisons to learn from the experience. The clips became some of the most talked about in cyberspace. The most popular of the videos was uploaded in April 2007. It showed over 1,500 male inmates imitating the zombie dance featured in the music video of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\". The prisoners wore their orange jail-issue jumpsuits during the performance in the jail's exercise yard. The Los Angeles Times later commented that the dance moves were not lifted directly from the video, \\"but they are performed with such precision it somehow seems that they must have been\\". Inmate Crisanto Nierre played the role of Michael Jackson. Nierre, who at the time was awaiting trial on drug charges, has been a fan of Jackson since he was in a dance troupe at high school. USA Today noted that his favorite Jackson tracks were \\"Bad\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\". Former pizza chef Wenjiel Resane, who is gay, played the part of Jackson's girlfriend. At the time, Resane had already been at the prison for three years, also awaiting trial on drug charges. Forty-eight hours after being uploaded onto YouTube, the video had been viewed 266,000 times. After a week, the number of hits had risen to over one million. Within two weeks of the Thriller video being uploaded, it had been viewed by some three million YouTube users. The following week, the number had almost doubled, coming close to six million hits. On average, the clip received 300,000 views per day at its peak. The video generated mixed reviews, with some critics claiming that Garcia forced the inmates to perform, an accusation the prisoners refuted. Several of the inmates showed devotion towards their prison chief, with as many as 20 prisoners bearing tattoos with Garcia's name. Garcia's concept of having prisoners dance as part of a rehabilitation program has been copied by several prisons, including jails in Quezon province and Muntinlupa. Garcia commented that the movie showed that dancing is not a cruel or unusual punishment. He claimed that his prison showed that negative inmates could be turned into positive individuals, through the concept of a \\"revolutionized penology\\". Following Garcia's presentation of an inmate performance at the province's Founding Day celebrations, a donation of $35,000 was given to the prison. Each inmate received $22 of the gift, deposited into a prison passbook account. The remaining money went to the Cebu province and its employees, to defray the costs of incarceration. The prison inmates Thriller performance made it to the pages of Time‚Äîon the international magazine‚Äôs list of the most watchable Internet videos for 2007. The inmates' interpretation of the Thriller music video was ranked the fifth of 10 \\"most popular viral videos\\" of the year, or the \\"Web clips we couldn‚Äôt stop watching\\". The list also included appearances by Hillary Clinton, Will Ferrell and Chris Crocker for his Leave Britney Alone! clip. Time described the convicts as \\"orange-jumpsuited accused murderers, rapists and drug dealers\\", and noted that their performance was made in \\"homage\\" to Jackson's Thriller. The magazine stated that the viral video had been downloaded more than nine million times. (As of January 18, 2008, the reported views of the video have reached almost 15 million). Edward Latessa, professor and head of division of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati, declared that the prisoners who are dancing are not being rehabilitated. Latessa stated that the prisoners may think that they are getting something out of the performances, when, in reality, they are not. He described it as having a potentially harmful effect. The professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs, like substance abuse or family reunification programs, should be implemented with as much coordination and vigor. The detention workers disagreed with the assessment, deeming the activities to be an integral part of rehabilitation. \\"It combines the need for physical exercise and their love to sing and dance\\", Thomeczeck argued. \\"In more ways than one, it contributes to their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration. It's a way to put themselves together physically and probably spiritually. That's good, isn't it?\\". Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"Now that's a 'breakout' hit: The clip of inmates at a high-security prison in the Philippines performing an intricately choreographed dance to Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" has nabbed more than 42 million views since 2007.\\"Geier, Thom; Jensen, Jeff; Jordan, Tina; Lyons, Margaret; Markovitz, Adam; Nashawaty, Chris; Pastorek, Whitney; Rice, Lynette; Rottenberg, Josh; Schwartz, Missy; Slezak, Michael; Snierson, Dan; Stack, Tim; Stroup, Kate; Tucker, Ken; Vary, Adam B.; Vozick-Levinson, Simon; Ward, Kate (December 11, 2009), \\"The 100 Greatest Movies, TV Shows, Albums, Books, Characters, Scenes, Episodes, Songs, Dresses, Music Videos, and Trends that Entertained Us over the Past 10 Years\\". Entertainment Weekly. (1079/1080):74-84 Aftermath In late 2007, Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition 2 scheduled a visit from some of its celebrities to the provincial jail. The celebrities danced with 1,600 CPDRC inmates to the tune of \\"Rico Mambo\\" as part of their weekly task, set by Big Brother. The request had been made by Maria Rowena Benitez, Pinoy Big Brother production manager. The housemates were not informed of their task, but were brought to the prison in blindfolds. They were then subsequently given back their sight, with the inmates surrounding them. Beforehand, it was also announced that the Big Brother celebrity housemates would perform a concert, with the proceeds being donated to CPDRC. The concert, held inside the Pinoy Big Brother house in Manila, was attended by 100 people, who each paid P1,000. The CPDRC inmates have performed numerous other songs, including Queen's \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" and several songs from Sister Act, with prisoners dressing as nuns in habits. 44 female inmates, held in a separate wing from the males, joined the men in a dance to \\"I Will Follow Him\\". \\"Hail Holy Queen\\", from Sister Act 2, and the Algorithm March were also performed by the convicts and then upload onto YouTube. The inmates dance in order to help pass the time while serving their prison sentences or awaiting a trial. More than 900 of the inmates take part in the routines, with a small group of dancers at the core of each performance. Every prisoner at CPDRC, apart from the old and the infirm, has a part in the routine. Garcia directs and choreographs each of the dances. The inmates' participation is said to be completely voluntary, with no prisoner being forced to dance. \\"It would be different if they are being forced to dance\\", declared Rubio. \\"I've never known any prisoners being forced to dance. It's normal to dance.\\" The inmates have express pride at their performing success, and routinely query the viewing figures for their routines. By August 2007, ten of the prisoners' performances had been viewed over 100,000 times each. In 2007, the prisoners stated that they were to perform to Vanilla Ice's \\"Ice Ice Baby\\". At the time, they were also practicing Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder's \\"Together in Electric Dreams\\", a homage to the inmates' fans. In January 2008, Garcia requested that the prisoners perform their Thriller routine at the annual Sinulog festival, a popular street-music festival organised by the Catholic Augustinian in celebration of baby Jesus. The nine-day fiesta and party is preceded by a solemn religious procession. The mayor of Cebu, Tomas Osmena, refused to permit the request, stating that the inmates could dance all they wanted in jail. \\"I will not allow it even if Michael Jackson joins them\\", he commented. Garcia had hoped that, by allowing the inmates to be a part of the Sinulog celebrations, Cebu would showcase the success of his rehabilitation programme. \\"By showing these highly disciplined inmates, perhaps we might just be giving hope that Cebu is not just about the mardi gras, but rather, Cebu is about leadership and good governance.\\" The CPDRC inmates were expected to be tough competition for the Lumad Basakonon, a group which has won the free interpretation category of the Sinulog festival for two consecutive years. As a result of the prisoners' internet fame, many visitors come to CPDRC to view the monthly performances held by the convicts. Their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard. At the jail, visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates. They can also buy souvenir prison shirts. A research student from The Netherlands, Anne Yzerman, attended one of the two-hour shows and praised the convicts. \\"They are so good at dancing all the time. I was really impressed.\\" The CPDRC inmates dance numbers include a rendition of Bonnie Tyler's \\"Holding Out for a Hero\\". The performance involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the Dalai Lama, Pope John Paul II and Mahatma Gandhi. After Michael Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, Cebu prison officials announced that the prison inmates would be recreating the Thriller routine on the following Saturday, June 27, 2009. On June 27, 2009, the tribute video was uploaded with a dance routine for \\"Ben\\", \\"I'll Be There\\", and \\"We Are the World\\". In January 2010, the prisoners performed \\"The Drill\\" and \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" [filmed on professional camera] as another tribute to Jackson, and for the release of the Michael Jackson's This Is It DVD and Blu-ray disc. In 2011, in the Glee episode \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\", Glee club director Will Schuester made a reference about the \\"Thriller\\" viral video to motivate the children to do a \\"Thriller\\" performance much like from the Philippine prison.

From a gasworks in North Geelong it converted coal into town gas for use in homes and industry. The company was founded in 1858 and existed until 1971 when Geelong was converted to natural gas and the company was bought out by the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria. Establishment The first attempts at establishing a reticulated gas supply in Geelong were made in 1854. However, it was not until July 1857 that a meeting was held at the National Hotel to establish a gas company in Geelong. The first official meeting was held on 20 August 1857. The company was established by Act No. 57 in 1857 \\"to promote the convenience of the inhabitants of the Town of Geelong and the municipal district of Newtown and Chilwell.\\" The company planned to build a plant capable of producing of gas a year. To distribute this gas to customers, of gas mains was planned, made of to pipes.The Geelong Gas Company 1858 - 1958: 100 years of public service and progressive development April 1858 saw the company start its search for land to erect the gasworks on. The first site chosen was in central Geelong. bounded by Bellarine Street, Corio Bay, Corio Street and Corio Terrace (now Brougham Street). This site was rejected by nearby homeowners, as well as government representative, MLC M.J. Strachan, due to health issues having the plant in the city. The Gas Company Act of 4 June 1858 prohibited gas production in the Corporation of Geelong leaving the company to find another site. Land on the western side of the railway station at North Geelong was purchased from the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company for the gasworks. The sale was accepted in March 1859, for ¬£200 an acre, for a total of . A railway siding for the gasworks was provided in September 1859, and was the first private siding in the area. On 10 February 1860 the foundation stone was laid. A time capsule was also laid with newspapers, coins, a copy of the constitution of company, and a list of those involved with the gasworks construction. This capsule was recovered in 1924 and presented to the company. The original cost of the scheme was not exceed ¬£25,000. The final price was ¬£24,135. The first gas lamp connected to the system was tested on 3 May 1860. Three weeks later on 24 May there was an official event marking the first gas lamp in Geelong. Expansion In the first year of operation for the company, a ten per cent dividend was paid to shareholders from profits. By 1894 13 per cent of business and street lighting in Geelong was gas powered. In the City of Geelong there were 263 street gas lamps, in the City of Newtown and Chilwell there were 48, in the City of Geelong West there were 45, and there was a single lamp in the Shire of South Barwon. The street lights used gave the equivalent light of 15 sperm candles for each of gas burnt. However, by 1913 most of the major street lighting contracts had been lost to electricity. By the end of World War I capacity at the gasworks was stretched, so in 1924 the works were rebuilt with new technology. 1925 was the first industrial use of gas, before this time it was primarily used in households. The company built new offices at 161 Ryrie Street in 1920. In 1957 the No. 5 gas holder was erected in Riversdale Road Newtown at a cost of ¬£110,000 pounds to serve proposed gas main extensions south of Barwon River. By 1958 the company had 18,000 customers and of gas mains throughout Geelong. In 1963 it had grown to of gas mains, 46 per cent being less than 10 years old, and 30 per cent less than 5 years old. A new gas holder of capacity was also commissioned during 1964, built by the Power-Gas Corporation (Australia) Pty Ltd.Geelong Gas Company: Annual Report 1963 Obsolescence By the 1960s production of gas from coal was an obsolete technology. By 1963 the Geelong Gas Company had changed production methods, using an Onia Gegi reforming plant to convert hydrocarbon gases from the Shell oil refinery at Corio into town gas. The new reforming plant was visited by many other gas companies as an example of modern Syngas technology. The former coal carbonising equipment was only used when coke (a by-product of the gasification process) was required. The discovery of abundant reserves of natural gas in Bass Strait shook up town gas production. On 16 March 1967 a letter of intent was signed by the Geelong Gas Company with the Esso Exploration and Production of Australia Ltd and Haematite Petroleum Pty Ltd to buy natural gas from their Bass Strait gas fields for a 20-year period.Geelong Gas Company: Annual Report 1967 The cost of conversion of the Geelong system to natural gas was estimated at $2.5 to $3 million, with a likely completion date of 1971. The conversion entailed building a new pipeline from Melbourne, purging the old gas from the mains, change over of all burners in all gas appliances, changes to valves in the distribution network to permit the higher pressures, and removal of the now-unneeded gasworks. The main natural gas pipeline between Geelong and Melbourne was finished in February 1971. Costing $1.7 million, the pipeline was designed to operate at a maximum pressure of 1000psi, and carry of gas a day. Conversion of homes to natural gas commenced on 15 March 1971, starting at suburbs furthermost from the gasworks, and was completed by the end of August 1971. The end A takeover bid for the Geelong Gas Company was issued on 11 December 1964 when the company was served with a notice of acquisition by the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria. At this time the 20 shilling ($2) shares in the company were valued at one pound, 16 shillings and sixpence ($3.65), with a total of about 800 shareholders in the company. The takeover bid was later withdrawn. A takeover bid by the Gas and Fuel Corporation was made in 1970 when a Bill was passed in the State Parliament, with shareholders offered $3.40 a share. The takeover was ratified when 70% of shareholders accepted the offer, and the Geelong Gas Company ceased to exist on 30 June 1971.deListedL GEELONG GAS COMPANY LIMITED There was some controversy over the takeover, with it being revealed that a senior accountant with the Gas and Fuel Corporation had bought 11,000 shares in the Geelong Gas Company shortly before the takeover was made public. It was proved that the accountant had used insider knowledge to buy the shares, but the State Government was told no action could be taken. The issue remained alive until late 1971 when then Opposition Leader Mr Clyde Holding called for a further investigation. This move was quashed by then Premier Sir Henry Bolte on the advice of the Victorian Auditor General. The gasworks themselves were demolished in September 1972, but the railway siding and the concrete foundations of a gas holder are still visible on the site today. The company offices at 161 Ryrie Street are now listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

Ritchie informs Phil's family of the charges against him and tells Sharon that Phil wants her to visit him in prison. The following day, Ritchie refuses to help the Mitchells further as she hasn't been paid and offers to pass Phil's case files to another solicitor, which angers Sharon who accuses Ritchie of being disloyal. Two weeks later, Sharon contacts Ritchie and convinces her to take on Phil's case again after promising to come up with the money Ritchie is owed. In April, Phil meets up with Ritchie after stealing her client book from her office. He threatens to reveal her criminal clients if she does not clear the Mitchell's debt with her.

She later updates Phil on Ben's situation and he thanks her, causing Ritchie to remind him to pay her on time. Marsden asks Ritchie to wait in the interview room whilst she and Keeble review some new evidence. Ritchie then calls Phil from the police station and gives him another update on Ben's situation. Ritchie is annoyed at being kept waiting by Marsden and nearly overhears her telling DS Cameron Bryant (Glen Wallace) that she used to be a stripper to pay her fees for law school. Later in the week, Ritchie reveals that Ben will still be held in custody for mugging Lucy and that the police will be wanting to question Jay over the mugging too, causing Jay to flee. Ritchie sits in on Marsden's interview of Ben over Lucy's mugging. When Marsden goads Ben and reduces him to tears, Ritchie orders her to terminate the interview and release Ben, threatening to report her to her superior officer if she does not. In November, Ritchie helps Sharon seize control of Phil's assets by power of attorney after his drinking spirals out of control and she signs them over to Sharon and Ben. In March 2016, Ben and Ronnie contact Ritchie when they attempt to seize control of Phil's businesses as he continues to behave erratically, and Phil throws them out of his house when he discovers what they are planning. Ritchie tells Ronnie that there is nothing she can do and Phil shouts at her as she gets in her car to leave. After Phil destroys the car lot with a digger and is arrested, Ritchie brings him home from the police station the following day. In April, Ritche reappears when Jay is arrested for having a relationship with an underage girl. Ritchie refuses to represent him, but advises him to speak to the duty solicitor and informs the Mitchells that Jay is being charged with possession of indecent images of a child. In May, Sharon hires Ritchie to represent Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) after he is arrested for assaulting his adoptive mother Jane Beale (Laurie Brett). Ritchie advises Bobby not to comment during his police interview but Bobby ignores this. After the interview, Ritchie leaves the room, and DS Howard South (Paul Stocker) then informs her that Bobby has confessed to Lucy's murder. Ritchie then sits in when the police interview Bobby about Lucy's death. The following week, Ritchie is present when Bobby is charged with unlawful killing, and is annoyed when he is refused bail. Ritchie then visits Jane and Ian at the hospital, where Jane is recovering, and advises them to convince Bobby to plead not guilty, to give her time to build up a convincing defence case before the trial. Ritchie visits Ian and Jane at the hospital again on the day of Bobby's sentencing. She tells them that as Bobby had pleaded guilty there is a chance that he could return home if the judge sentences him to a non-custodial youth rehabilitation order. Ritchie later attends Bobby's sentencing and mitigates for him, but despite her best efforts, Bobby is sentenced to three years youth custody. The following day she informs Ian of Bobby's progress in prison and tells him that Bobby is doing well as it is different to an adult prison. Ritchie also suggests appealing against Bobby's sentence, and offers to argue that he could be rehabilitated more at home. She then tells Ian that the choice is Bobby's but then tells Sharon and Kathy, who is actually alive, that Bobby may choose to stay in prison and serve his sentence. In October, Ritchie visits Phil in hospital, where he is suffering from liver failure, and helps him amend his will, leaving everything to his daughter Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper). After Sharon objects, Phil calls Ritchie back to the hospital and gets her to change the will to include Ben and Sharon's son Dennis Rickman (Bleu Landau).

It came out in between The Mechanic (1972) and Death Wish (1974), all three of which teamed up actor/director Bronson and Winner. Norman Fell and John Ritter appear as cops in this film, not too long before the TV series Three's Company. Character actor Stuart Margolin plays a significant role; he also appeared in Death Wish. Plot The film involves a plot by a present-day (1973) Mafia don (Martin Balsam) to avenge the killings of a group of Mafia dons back in 1931 (\\"The Night of Sicilian Vespers\\") with a bold nationwide counter-strike against most of the current Italian and Jewish syndicate heads using teams of Vietnam vets instead of Mafia hit men. (\\"Stone killer\\" means a Mafia hit man who is not himself a member of the Mafia.) Bronson plays a gritty, independent detective who stumbles across the plot when a washed-up former hit man is killed under circumstances that make it clear that it was an inside job and that Mafia were involved. He then slowly uncovers the clues that point to a seemingly impossible plot. Cast *Charles Bronson as Lou Torrey *Martin Balsam as Al Vescari *David Sheiner as Guido Lorenz *Norman Fell as Daniels *Ralph Waite as Mathews *Paul Koslo as Langley *Stuart Margolin as Lawrence *Jack Colvin as Jumper *John Ritter as Hart Production The film was based on the 1969 novel A Complete State of Death by John Gardner writing under the name Derek Torry. The New York Times called it a \\"message novel, only slightly pretentious, relevant but under paced.\\" The novel was greatly changed in the adaptation. Filming took place in May 1973. During the shootout in the parking garage at the film's climax, stunt Coordinator Alan Gibbs' seat-belt snapped and his head struck the steering wheel, causing him to sustain serious injuries in one of the numerous car crashes that take place. The cars were rentals from Hertz, who were so concerned with damage that they sent a representative to the set to reclaim them. Winner supposedly told the rep, \\"You should be glad we're crashing your (expletive) awful cars. You'll be able to write them off completely and get nice new ones.\\" Reception Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four and called it \\"a superior example of its type ‚Äì tough cop against the mob ‚Äì and probably the best violent big-city police movie since 'Dirty Harry.' It's not much more, nor does it mean to be; it offers stylish escapism at breakneck speed, and it gives us a chase and a gun battle that surpass themselves.\\" Roger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote, \\"Anyone suspected of liking a Michael Winner movie may be assumed guilty until proven innocent. Since there is no way in which I can be proven innocent, I might as well confess to liking Winner's latest, 'The Stone Killer,' very much indeed.\\"Greenspun, Roger (August 30, 1973). \\"Film: 'The Stone Killer\\". The New York Times. 26. Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called the film \\"a confused, meandering crime potboiler\\", explaining, \\"The story and direction reach for so many bases that the end result is a lot of cinema razzle-dazzle without substance.\\"Murphy, Arthur D. (August 22, 1973). \\"Film Reviews: The Stone Killer\\". Variety. 12. Fredric Milstein of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Want a fast, slick, violent, entertaining minor spinoff of 'The French Connection,' complete with vicious, rebellious cop who doesn't care how much property he busts up during the really spectacular chase sequence?

Before 2018, the race was held in mid-August. G.P. de l'Amiti√© The first edition of the race was in 1970, as the G.P. de l'Amiti√© (Friendship G.P.). It was held over four or five days in early September and served as a preparation for the Tour de l'Avenir, thus attracting also international riders, especially the Spanish team. The course ran straight across the French Alpes, starting in Nice, on the C√¥te d'Azur, and finishing in Bourg-en-Bresse, the capital of the Bresse region, north of Lyon, at the base of the Jura mountain range. Main difficulty was the mountain finish on Les Orres. In uneven years the course was reversed: from Bourg to Nice. As the Tour de l'Avenir threatened to be cancelled in 1976, the G.P. de l'Amiti√© jumped in and served as replacement, expanding the race to nine days. The execution of this event strained the organisation so much that it had to back down. From 1978 onwards the race merely had a national field of participants and was conducted only in the Provence Alpes, starting and finishing in Nice, still with the mountain finish on Les Orres. The organisation recovered however, and opened their race to professionals in 1986. A lot of French riders used this tough race - from Nice, via Valloire (over the Galibier), to Combloux - as a preparation for the Tour de l'Avenir. Tour de l'Ain In 1989 new organizers came, Dante Lavacca, Armand Peracca, and Maurice Josserand. They took the race back to its roots, to Bourg-en- Bresse, and changed its name into Tour de l'Ain. From 1989 to 1992 it was an amateur event. In 1993 it became open to professionals. In 1999 Cyclisme Organisation took over the organizing of the event and in the 1999 edition for the first time the climb of the Grand Colombier was included. The race had a 2.5 UCI (pro-am) status but was in 2002 promoted to the professional 2.3 category. Since the inception of the UCI ProTour and the UCI Continental circuits in 2005, the race has been classed into category 2.1 (in which all former 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 races were combined). The race, which travels through the Ain departement into the Jura Mountains, combines both sprinting and mountainous stages. The 1,534 metre high Grand Colombier has featured as a decisive climb in the stage race. The 2018 version consisted of three stages; while previous versions of the event contained four or five stages (including prologues).

Meteorological history On August 11, a low-level circulation center formed in conjunction with a persistent area of convection about southeast of Naha, Okinawa. Northerly upper-level winds initially provided beneficial divergence, though also resulted in detrimental wind shear and lack of inflow. Upper-level conditions gradually became more favorable for development as the disturbance tracked along the eastern periphery of an upper-level anticyclone. With convective rain bands wrapping into the circulation, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system late on August 11. Remaining nearly stationary between ridges to its northeast and southwest, the system developed further, and early on August 12 the JTWC classified it as Tropical Depression 09W. Shortly thereafter, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified it as a tropical depression while located about southeast of Okinawa. Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical stormftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2007081215-WTPN.PGTW based on Dvorak technique satellite intensity estimates andftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2007081215-WDPN.PGTW the storm exhibiting tightly-curved convective bands. An upper-level low helped to reduce wind shear that had been affecting the storm. The JTWC also warned of the possibility of rapid intensification. The JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm later that day and named it Sepat, a name contributed by Malaysia referring to a freshwater fish species. By early the next morning, August 13, Sepat had a banding eye visible on microwave satellite imageryftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2007081303-WDPN.PGTW and had remained in an environment conducive for strengthening, including weakening wind shear.

A member of the Australian Labor Party, she was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Council in 1993 until moving to the Legislative Assembly in 1996, where she served as a senior minister in the Gallop state Labor government. She resigned from state politics in July 2010 in an unsuccessful attempt to win the federal seat of Canning at the 2010 federal election, where she then moved to local politics as the mayor of the City of Vincent from 2011 to 2013. She was elected to the federal seat of Perth at the 2013 federal election, though did not contest the seat at the 2016 federal election. She returned to Western Australian state politics at the 2017 state election as a Legislative Council member for the North Metropolitan region. Political career MacTiernan studied at the University of Western Australia where she completed an arts degree and a law degree. She started her career with the federal government, in the area of Aboriginal employment and training. She was elected to the Perth City Council in 1988, where she remained until 1994. In 1993, she was elected as the member for the East Metropolitan region in the Western Australian Legislative Council. She was Minister for Planning and Infrastructure in the Western Australian government from 2001 to 2008. During that time she established the Public Transport Authority (Western Australia) which helped to transform the planning and management of public transport, particularly in Perth. Her period in office saw the construction of many railway and road projects, including the building of the 70-kilometre-long Mandurah Line (including a tunnel under central Perth), the extensions of the Joondalup Line, Mitchell Freeway, and the Roe and Tonkin Highways, as well as the Kwinana Freeway/Forrest Highway extensions. In early 2010, she announced her plans to contest the Liberal-held federal seat of Canning, which included her state seat, and on 26 February 2010 resigned from the shadow ministry. She officially resigned from state parliament on 19 July 2010, two days after prime minister Julia Gillard had announced the timetable for the 2010 federal election. Despite particularly strong results in areas which she had previously represented, MacTiernan came up short of victory, only garnering a 2.16 percent swing‚Äîthree points short of what she needed to take the seat from Llberal incumbent Don Randall. She was elected as the mayor of the City of Vincent in October 2011. After Stephen Smith revealed that he was going to retire as member for the federal electorate of Perth at the 2013 federal election, MacTiernan announced her intention to contest the seat for the ALP, and the only other candidate for Labor pre-selection Matthew Keogh withdrew his nomination. At the election on 7 September, MacTiernan was successful in winning the seat despite a 1.5% swing against her. In July 2014 it was reported that a UMR \\"robo-poll\\" of 23 federal electorates, conducted for the National Tertiary Education Union, had found that MacTiernan was the second most popular federal MP, with an approval rating among her own constituents of +30. MacTiernan announced in February 2016 that she would not be contesting her seat at the 2016 federal election. She was succeeded by Labor's Tim Hammond. In August 2016 MacTiernan announced she would return to Western Australian state politics, and was placed as WA Labor's first candidate for the North Metropolitan electoral region. The landslide victory for WA Labor at the 2017 state election ensured her return to the Legislative Council. In 2019 it was reported that MacTiernan had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and had undergone surgery and chemotherapy.

Development Designed as a 6√ó4 off-road vehicle for use in Britain's colonies where sealed roads were scarce, the Pioneer was first produced in 1927. Though lacking all- wheel drive, its combination of a suspension with great travel, excellent traction, and a low-revving engine gave it impressive pulling power on rough ground at low speeds. Though not designed for military use, the British War Office purchased a single petrol engined example in 1932. Equipped as a tank transporter with a permanently coupled 18t semi-trailer, it was assigned to a training unit but did not initially catch on. Additional transporters were not purchased until 1937. Military use With the exception of the single 1932 tank transporter, all Pioneers purchased by the British Army were equipped with a 102 bhp Gardner 6-cylinder diesel engine, driving the rear wheels through a constant-mesh gearbox and fitted with a power take-off driving a Scammell winch.Strategic defence review Commercial Motor 19 July 2012 page 43 =Artillery tractor= Pioneer artillery tractors in the London Victory Parade, June 1946 Introduced in 1935, the Pioneer R100 heavy artillery tractor was used throughout World War II to tow medium and heavy artillery pieces. It had accommodation for the gun's crew, tools, equipment, and ammunition. Typical early war use included towing such medium pieces as the 60-pounder, 6-inch howitzer and even the 4.5-inch gun and 5.5-inch howitzer until the AEC Matador medium gun tractor was issued in sufficient numbers. Heavy artillery pieces towed included the 6-inch gun, 8-inch howitzer, 155 mm Long Tom and the 7.2-inch howitzer. Many Pioneer gun tractors were lost in France in June 1940 with the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), either destroyed by the withdrawing troops or captured by the Germans. Scammel produced 980 Pioneer R100 heavy artillery tractors by the end of the war. As this quantity was insufficient to meet requirements, the Pioneer was supplemented by the Albion CX22S heavy artillery tractor from late 1943. =Recovery vehicle= Pioneer recovering a Universal Carrier, Sussex 1941 From 1936, the British Army began to receive Pioneer heavy recovery vehicles. The first 43 delivered were designated the Pioneer SV1SREME Museum Pioneer SV1S and the Pioneer SV1T both with a 3-ton folding crane and lockers for recovery equipment and towing bars. Most of these early Pioneer recovery vehicles were lost with the BEF. The Pioneer SV2SREME Museum Pioneer SV2S had a simpler redesigned extending crane that provided greater lifting height. It was Introduced in 1938 and remained in production throughout the war, with a total of 1,975 built by the end of the war. Among the Pioneer's equipment was a pair of tracks that could be fitted over the two rear wheels, converting it temporarily into a half- track and giving greater traction on soft ground. The last Pioneer recovery vehicle was not retired from the British Army until the 1980s in Belize. =Tank Transporter= Matilda tank equipped with AMRA Mk 1a being loaded onto a Scammell transporter, August 1942. Delivery of a production tank transporter did not begin until 1937. This was equipped with a longer wheelbase for an extended cab to accommodate the tank crew as passengers and larger rear wheels than the artillery tractor and recovery vehicle variants. It was designated Pioneer TRCU20.Ware, p. 125. 20- and 30-ton (Pioneer TRMU30/TRCU30) tractor/trailer combinations were delivered. In both cases, the trailer was more-or-less fixed to the tractor, not demountable like modern semi-trailer trucks. Hinged ramps were used to get the tank onto the trailer; if the tank was immobilised, it could be pulled onto the trailer with the tractor unit's winch. Pioneer tractor/trailer combinations proved too tall to carry higher profile US tanks under some British bridges, resulting in their being superseded by the American Diamond T tank transporter from 1941 on. Despite this, it remained in production throughout the war, with 459 being produced. As a result of their tall profile the trailers proved undesirable postwar and most were scrapped; the tractors were retained for use with other trailers or sold into civilian use.

The supersymmetric Higgs mass parameter Œº appears as the following term in the superpotential: ŒºHuHd. It is necessary to provide a mass for the fermionic superpartners of the Higgs bosons, i.e. the higgsinos, and it enters as well the scalar potential of the Higgs bosons. To ensure that Hu and Hd get a non-zero vacuum expectation value after electroweak symmetry breaking, Œº should be of the order of magnitude of the electroweak scale, many orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck scale, which is the natural cutoff scale. This brings about a problem of naturalness: why is that scale so much smaller than the cutoff scale? And why, if the Œº term in the superpotential has different physical origins, do the corresponding scale happen to fall so close to each other? Before LHC, it was thought that the soft supersymmetry breaking terms should also be of the same order of magnitude as the electroweak scale. This was negated by the Higgs mass measurements and limits on supersymmetry models. One proposed solution, known as the Giudice-Masiero mechanism, is that this term does not appear explicitly in the Lagrangian, because it violates some global symmetry, and can therefore be created only via spontaneous breaking of this symmetry. This is proposed to happen together with F-term supersymmetry breaking, with a spurious field X that parameterizes the hidden supersymmetry- breaking sector of the theory (meaning that FX is the non-zero F-term). Let us assume that the Kahler potential includes a term of the form {X over M_{pl}} H_u H_d times some dimensionless coefficient which is naturally of order one where Mpl is Planck mass.

It was founded by Filipino filmmaker Amable \\"Tikoy\\" Aguiluz in 1999. The focus of the festival is on the cinema of the Philippines as well as Southeast Asian cinema. The Cinemanila icon is the bulol, a deity whose presence ensures good harvest. The Cinemanila International Film Festival invokes the bulol as a blessing towards the Filipino film industry in general ‚Äì as a prayer towards good harvest, a plentiful bounty of excellent Filipino films. In the festival's competitive section, the top award is the Lino Brocka Award, given in honor of the acclaimed Filipino director, Lino Brocka. Another award, the Ishmael Bernal Award for Young Cinema, was first given at the 2000 festival, in honor of Filipino director Ishmael Bernal, to young independent Filipino filmmakers. One of Cinemanila's running components is Sine Barangay - a three-day event with free film appreciation and education workshops, culminating in an outdoor screening to barangay residents.\\"Filmfest in your neighborhood\\" , by Gerry Plaza, Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2008-10-24 It was previously held at the Marikina Riverbanks and Bonifacio High Street. In 2012, Cinemanila will launch the \\"Cinemanila Moonlight Series\\", regular outdoor screenings expanded from Sine Barangay, to take place over the course of Manila's dry season. History The second Cinemanila was held from July 3 to 10, 1999 in Mandaluyong City. It was the first international film festival in the Philippines since the Manila International Film Festival, which had been held in the 1980s. (There is the Metro Manila Film Festival, but it is a national festival screening only Filipino films.) The festival featured a lecture on cinematography by Australian-Hong Kong cinematographer Christopher Doyle. The festival has typically been a low-key affair in terms of red-carpet visits by foreign celebrities. However, in 2003, the festival honored Hollywood stars with Filipino-American roots, and was graced by Lou Diamond Phillips, Tia Carrere, Dean Devlin and Rob Schneider. The same year, the first Lifetime Achievement Award was given, honoring Indonesian actress Christine Hakim. In 2007, director Quentin Tarantino and Thai director Chatrichalerm Yukol were among the Lifetime Achievement recipients. A retrospective of Tarantino's feature films was shown, from Reservoir Dogs to Kill Bill. He attended the awards ceremony at Malaca√±an Palace, accepting the award from President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Both the president and the honoree were late to ceremony due to being stuck in a traffic jam. Tarantino, accompanied by festival founder Tikoy Aguiluz, took a pedicab to make it to the ceremony, and showed up without leather shoes as required to enter the palace. He was given a new pair of shoes by Aquiliuz. The festival is closely identified with its founder, filmmaker Tikoy Aguiluz, who has a reputation as a maverick. In 2006, he accused the Philippine media of not doing enough to promote the festival and independent films, stating at a news conference: \\"All I want from you writers are three lines and a picture promoting the festival. Why do you think it's so hard for independent producers to have success here, locally? I haven't seen any support from either broadsheet or tabloids with any story on independent cinema.\\" Among the world community of film festivals, Cinemanila has gained respectability with its programming of independent Asian film. Jurors at past festivals have included Christian Jeune, director of the film department of the Cannes Film Festival. Early incarnations of the festival were held outside of Manila, though still in the Metro Manila area, in Makati City, and for a time was known as the Makati Cinemanila International Film Festival. In 2005, the festival moved to the Manila city limits, with screenings held at SM City Manila and Robinsons Ermita cinemas.

We applaud the directors or their sharp eye for details, their patience and their restraint. They let the mundane details of the daily life of a poor blind boy speak to the audience directly but quietly... For trusting these details to resonate with the audience universally and ..for not exploiting a subject that could be easily exploited. * Tumbang Preso by Antoinette Jadaone as Best Short Film, - (Citation) We applaud the film Tumbang Preso for the clever use of one set of dialogue to contrast and parallel the world of Estong as a child and Estong as a grown-up. The director understands the short film medium and has the discipline to work within the limitations of it to produce a fun and very watchable short film. * Ishmael Bernal Award: Christopher Gozum for Surreal Random MMS Texts (Surreal Random MMS Texts for a mother, a sister, and a wife who longs for you: landscape with figures) - (Citation) We found Christopher Gozum‚Äôs flm inspiring. He was able to combine the beauty of Carlos Bulasan‚Äôs poetry with minimalist and random images of LCD screens, daily life, creating rhythm light and sound from them to convey the longing and displacement of a Filipino working in the Middle East. Revelatory and humbling, we hope this award will encourage the director to continue his quest of mapping the human heart through film. Southeast Asia Film Competition * Frou Frou...

In Riemann surface theory and hyperbolic geometry, a Hurwitz surface, named after Adolf Hurwitz, is a compact Riemann surface with precisely 84(g ‚àí 1) automorphisms, where g is the genus of the surface. This number is maximal by virtue of Hurwitz's theorem on automorphisms . They are also referred to as Hurwitz curves, interpreting them as complex algebraic curves (complex dimension 1 = real dimension 2). The Fuchsian group of a Hurwitz surface is a finite index torsionfree normal subgroup of the (ordinary) (2,3,7) triangle group. The finite quotient group is precisely the automorphism group. Automorphisms of complex algebraic curves are orientation-preserving automorphisms of the underlying real surface; if one allows orientation-reversing isometries, this yields a group twice as large, of order 168(g ‚àí 1), which is sometimes of interest. A note on terminology ‚Äì in this and other contexts, the \\"(2,3,7) triangle group\\" most often refers, not to the full triangle group Œî(2,3,7) (the Coxeter group with Schwarz triangle (2,3,7) or a realization as a hyperbolic reflection group), but rather to the ordinary triangle group (the von Dyck group) D(2,3,7) of orientation-preserving maps (the rotation group), which is index 2. The group of complex automorphisms is a quotient of the ordinary (orientation-preserving) triangle group, while the group of (possibly orientation-reversing) isometries is a quotient of the full triangle group. Classification by genus Only finitely many Hurwitz surfaces occur with each genus. The function h(g) mapping the genus to the number of Hurwitz surfaces with that genus is unbounded, even though most of its values are zero. The sum :sum_{i=1}^{infty}frac{h(g)}{g^s} converges for s > 1/3, implying in an approximate sense that the genus of the nth Hurwitz surface grows at least as a cubic function of n . The Hurwitz surface of least genus is the Klein quartic of genus 3, with automorphism group the projective special linear group PSL(2,7), of order 84(3 ‚àí 1) = 168 = 23¬∑3¬∑7, which is a simple group; (or order 336 if one allows orientation-reversing isometries). The next possible genus is 7, possessed by the Macbeath surface, with automorphism group PSL(2,8), which is the simple group of order 84(7 ‚àí 1) = 504 = 23¬∑32¬∑7; if one includes orientation-reversing isometries, the group is of order 1,008. An interesting phenomenon occurs in the next possible genus, namely 14. Here there is a triple of distinct Riemann surfaces with the identical automorphism group (of order 84(14 ‚àí 1) = 1092 = 22¬∑3¬∑7¬∑13). The explanation for this phenomenon is arithmetic. Namely, in the ring of integers of the appropriate number field, the rational prime 13 splits as a product of three distinct prime ideals. The principal congruence subgroups defined by the triplet of primes produce Fuchsian groups corresponding to the first Hurwitz triplet. The sequence of allowable values for the genus of a Hurwitz surface begins :3, 7, 14, 17, 118, 129, 146, 385, 411, 474, 687, 769, 1009, 1025, 1459, 1537, 2091, ...

As a two-year-old in 1978 he was unbeaten in four races including the Horris Hill Stakes, but was rated some way below the best of his generation. In the following year he won the Greenham Stakes on his debut before being defeated by Tap On Wood when favourite for the classic 2000 Guineas. He went on to dominate British racing over one mile for the rest of 1979, winning the Heron Stakes, St James's Palace Stakes, Sussex Stakes, Waterford Crystal Mile, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and Challenge Stakes, earning comparisons with Brigadier Gerard. As a four-year-old he won the Lockinge Stakes but was off the course with injury problems for much of the season and was narrowly beaten by Known Fact when attempting to repeat his previous win in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. He retired from racing with a record of fourteen wins and two second places from sixteen starts. Kris went on to become a very successful breeding stallion, siring the classic winning fillies Oh So Sharp and Unite and being Leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland in 1985. He died in 2004. Background Kris was a dark chestnut horse with white socks on his hind feet, bred in England by his owner Lord Howard de Walden. He was sired by Sharpen Up and was the first foal of the broodmare Doubly Sure, making him a full brother to the champion two-year-old Diesis, and a half-brother to several other good winners including Rudimentary (Sandown Mile). The colt was named after a type of double-edged Malayan dagger. He was trained throughout his racing career by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in all of his races by Joe Mercer. Racing career =1978: two-year-old season= Kris ran four times as a two-year-old, winning all his starts. He began his racing career by winning a five furlong maiden race at Leicester Racecourse in June. In the following month he carried top weight in a minor race at Folkestone Racecourse. He won the race but finished he became \\"jarred up\\" on the hard ground and did not race again until the autumn. He returned in October for the Marston Moor Stakes at York, in which he was matched against five opponents, all of whom had winning form. He was among the leaders from the start and accelerated clear in the closing stages to win by eight lengths from Touch Boy. Later that month he was moved up in class and started the 5/6 favourite for the Group Three Horris Hill Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury. On this occasion, Mercer adopted different tactics and attempted to restrain Kris in the early stages. He expended a great deal of energy struggling against his jockey's efforts and looked beaten when Hardgreen went to the front, but rallied strongly in the final strides to win by a neck, with a gap of eight lengths back to Saher in third. =1979: three-year-old season= On his debut as a three-year-old Kris started 11/10 favourite for the Group Three Greenham Stakes at Newbury in which he was reopposed by Hardgreen, as well as the Guy Harwood-trained Young Generation. Looking very fit before the race he easily accounted for Hardgreen, but having his race seemingly won he was bustled up by Young Generation and Kris had to reassert himself before winning by three lengths. As the stable had already won the Craven Stakes with Lyphard's Wish, when stable jockey elected to ride Kris he became favourite for the 2,000 Guineas, despite reports that he had some training problems. In the race he was beaten half a length by the 20/1 outsider Tap On Wood and only just retained second in a close finish with Young Generation, who appeared somewhat unlucky in running. Cecil decided to give Kris more experience before Royal Ascot and he was sent to Kempton where he won the Heron Stakes easily from Blue Refrain despite being hampered on the final turn. At Royal Ascot in June he started second favourite for the St James's Palace Stakes behind Young Generation who, since the Guineas, had won both the Lockinge Stakes and the Prix Jean Prat. Kris led for most of the way and won by one and a half lengths from Young Generation with a long gap back to the Clive Brittain-trained Alert in third. In his next race, Kris was matched against older horses for the first time in the Group One Sussex Stakes at Goodwood in which he was opposed by the July Cup winner Thatching and the Champion Stakes winner Swiss Maid. Starting the 4/5 favourite he took the lead two furlongs from the finish and drew away from his opponent to win by five lengths from Swiss Maid, with Alert in third. Over the same course and distance three weeks later, the colt started 3/10 favourite for the Group Two Waterford Crystal Mile. Mercer again experimented with waiting tactics and turned into the straight in fifth place behind Radeztky, Jellaby, Fair Season and Swiss Maid. He produced a strong finishing run to take the lead a furlong out and won by three-quarters of a length from Jellaby, with Foveros and Lightning Label close behind in third and fourth. In late September Kris started 8/11 favourite for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot despite carrying seven pounds more than weight-for-age. He drew away in the last quarter mile to win by five lengths from Foveros, with Jellaby three lengths back in third. Despite rumors that he would move up in distance for the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October, the colt was actually dropped back in trip to end the 1979 season with a run in the Challenge Stakes over seven furlongs at the same course. Starting at odds of 4/9 he broke the course record for a three-year-old as he won by two and a half lengths from the Diadem Stakes winner Absalom. Although he easily defeated all his British rivals, he was never matched against his contemporary Irish River, who was equally dominant over one mile in France, beating Lyphard's Wish (Kris's stable companion) in the Prix du Moulin. =1980: four-year-old season= As a four-year-old, Kris began his season with two runs in May. In the Cold Shields Windows Trophy over seven furlongs at Haydock Park he looked less than fully fit but won from three opponents and set a new course record. At Newbury later that month he started 4/9 favourite for the Lockinge Stakes despite conceding seven pounds to his opponents. Looking very impressive before the race, Kris struggled to obtain a clear run in the closing stages but eventually gained the advantage in the closing stages to win by three quarters of a length from Foveros. For the second time in succession, he set a new course record although his win was only confirmed after a stewards' inquiry into possible interference caused when he forced his way through the field to deliver his winning run. His season was disrupted by several minor injuries, including a muscle strain which ruled him out of the Queen Anne Stakes and prevented him moving up to ten furlongs for the Eclipse Stakes. Other targets, including the Sussex Stakes and the Waterford Crystal Mile came and went before he eventually returned in the Crown of Crowns Stakes, a minor race over a mile at Goodwood in September. He was somewhat reluctant to enter the starting stalls, but won by twelve lengths from moderate opposition to record his ninth consecutive victory. On his final appearance he attempted to win a second successive Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in October and started favourite ahead of the 1980 2000 Guineas winner Known Fact. Kris took the lead on the final turn and went two lengths clear but was eventually worn down by Known Fact and beaten a neck after \\"a tremendous battle\\". Kris's connections offered no excuses, admitting that they had been beaten by a very good horse. Assessment In the International Classification for 1978, Kris was given a rating of 82, nine pounds behind the top-rated two-year-old Tromos. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 123, placing him eleven pounds behind Tromos and commented that he would probably improve but would need to \\"settle much better ... to have any hope of staying much beyond a mile\\". In the following year, Kris was rated the fifth-best three-year-old in Europe, level with the French miler Irish River, but behind Three Troikas, Troy, Le Marmot and Top Ville. Timeform rated him more highly, making him their Best Miler of the season with a rating of 135, and the second best horse of any age, two pounds behind Troy. Timeform's annual Racehorses of 1979 described him as \\"most genuine, reliable and enthusiatic\\" and that he had dominated the mile division to a greater extent than any horse since Brigadier Gerard. He was also named Champion Miler in the Gilbey Racing Awards, based on points accrued from performances in major races. In 1980, Timeform rated him on 134, a pound behind their Best Miler Known Fact and three behind their Horse of the Year Moorestyle. In the International Classification he was rated the fourth-best horse in Europe behind Moorestyle, Ela-Mana-Mou and Argument. Stud record After being syndicated with a value of ¬£4 million Kris stood at his owner's Thornton Stud near Thirsk, before moving to the Plantation Stud at Newmarket in 1994. He sired Oh So Sharp, winner of the 1,000 Guineas, Epsom Oaks and St. Leger in 1985, and Unite, winner of the Epsom Oaks in 1987. Kris was retired from active stud duty in 2002 and died of heart failure two years later at the age of twenty-eight.

Their mission is to patrol Argentina's exclusive economic zone and to enforce fishing regulations, but according to reports in November 2012 they ‚Äúhardly sail because of lack of resources for operational expenses‚Äù. Design Although its designers consider the A69 D'Estienne d'Orves class to be avisos, Argentina classifies the ships as corvettes. The Drummond-class ships are equipped mostly with German and Dutch electronic systems (instead of French)Official Argentine Navy site for better compatibility with the two MEKO classes in Argentine service, and integrated with the indigenous \\"Miniaco\\" combat system. History The first two ships of the class were built in 1977 in France for the South African Navy. The sale was embargoed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 during sea trials and the ships bought by Argentina instead on 25 September 1978. A third ship was ordered and entered service as on 22 June 1981, in time for the Falklands War the following year. There are minor differences in equipment fit compared to her sisters, for instance Granville has French Dagaie decoys rather than the British Corvus chaff launchers. On 28 March 1982 Granville and sailed from Argentina and took up station northeast of Port Stanley to cover the main amphibious landings on 2 April. Meanwhile, Guerrico covered the assault on South Georgia, sustaining significant damage from the Royal Marines in the process. After repairs she joined her sister ships north of the Falklands as Task Group 79.4, hoping to catch ships detached from the British task force.Freedman (2005), p. 272 On 29 April the corvettes were trailed by the submarine whilst she was looking for the Argentine aircraft carrier .Freedman (2005), p. 279 The Drummond class carried pennant numbers P-1 to P-3 until the introduction of the s in 1985 when they became P-31 to P-33. In 1994, they participated in Operation Uphold Democracy, the United Nations blockade of Haiti. During this time, they were based at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto Rico. ARA Granville was reported as active in the South Atlantic following a maintenance period which concluded in 2019. However, in the same year it was also reported that all three Drummond-class vessels could be decommissioned and that consideration was being given to the potential transfer of the ships to the Uruguayan Navy.

He is the nephew of legendary footballer Don Lindner. SANFL career Blessed with high marking and strong hands, as well as having no trouble kicking the ball 50 metres on the fly even into the wind, Lindner made his league debut for West Adelaide on 16 June 1980 but failed to cement his place in the top side, playing only 4 games and kicking 2 goals for a season mainly spent in the reserves. He went on to win the 1981 SANFL Reserves Magarey Medal, despite only playing 10 reserves games for the year. Following this, Lindner was given his chance by senior coach Neil Kerley and he became a regular in Wests top side in 1982, playing 15 games and kicking 37 goals. \\"The President\\", as Linder was known, had his best year with The Bloods in 1983. Playing mainly at Half forward but also at times playing Full-forward, Lindner kicked 77 goals for the season and along with regular full-forward Roger Luders (who kicked 105 for the season) and forward player Mike Smith, West Adelaide had the most potent attack in the league, the three kicking over 220 between them. This, combined with their fast and skillful ruck and mid-field plus a tough back line saw The Bloods win 18 of their 22 minor round games to finish minor premiers and easily won their way into the 1983 SANFL Grand Final with a 76-point win over reigning premiers in the Second Semi-final. Playing at half forward in the Grand Final in front of 47,129 fans at Football Park, Lindner kicked five goals, including a 60-metre goal from the centre square only seconds before the final siren, described by Channel 7 TV commentator Robert Oatey as having \\"really pile driven this one\\", as West defeated Sturt 21.16.(142) to 16.12.(108) for their first premiership since the year of Lindner's birth, 1961. In another coincidence, The Bloods coach on that day in 1961 was none other than Lindner's '83 Premiership coach Neil Kerley. Lindner first represented South Australia during 1983, playing a starring role in the win over Victoria at Football Park after coming into the side as a late replacement for Norwood full forward Neville Roberts. With his first kick he kicked the first goal of the game and SA went on to win by 58 points for their first win over Victoria in Adelaide since 1965. Lindner later played for the Croweaters in their loss to Western Australia at Perth's Subiaco Oval during the 1983 round robin series. Injury halted Lindner's 1984 season and he was reduced to playing only four games, kicking four goals (compared to 21 games and 77 goals in 1983) as West Adelaide failed to make the finals, finishing sixth with a 10-12 record. Following the 1984 SANFL season, Lindner signed with in the Victorian Football League (renamed the Australian Football League (AFL) in 1990). He would not play again for West Adelaide until he returned home to play for Adelaide's new AFL team the Adelaide Crows in 1991. Lindner was dropped by Crows coach Graham Cornes on occasions during 1991 which meant he was back playing for West Adelaide in the SANFL for the first time since 1984 (until 2014 the Adelaide Crows had no reserves team, so players played for their SANFL clubs when not in the AFL team or out injured). This worked out well for Lindner as he played enough games for The Bloods to qualify for West Adelaide's first finals campaign since 1985. West Adelaide, after a very slow start to their 1991 SANFL season came on strong in the 2nd half of the year winning 9 or their last 10 games to finish in 5th place and qualify for the 1991 SANFL Finals. Despite being a noted goal kicker, he mostly played in the backline in 1991 and was among The Bloods best players as their form continued by defeating defending premiers Port Adelaide 24.12 (156) to 10.7 (67) in the Elimination Final. They then accounted for Woodville-West Torrens in the First Semi-final 15.20 (110) to 8.12 (50) with Lindner again among The Bloods best players. West Adelaide made their way into their first Grand Final since their 1983 premiership when they defeated South Adelaide 18.16 (124) to 15.13 (103) in the Preliminary Final. In a game which was marred by several all-in brawls, West Adelaide's run of form was halted when they were trounced by North Adelaide 21.22 (146) to 11.7 (73) in front of only 39,276, the smallest SANFL Grand Final crowd since 40,409 attended the 1961 Grand Final between West Adelaide and Norwood. Lindner played a few games for The Bloods in 1992 when not playing for Adelaide or out injured, but he failed to make an impact as West Adelaide couldn't repeat their 1991 form and failed to make the finals in 1992 despite 1961 and 1983 premiership coach Neil Kerley returning for his 3rd stint with the club. VFL/AFL Career Bruce Lindner made his debut for Geelong against in Round 1 of the 1985 VFL season. Lindner picked up 18 possessions and kicked one goal in a solid debut in the VFL. He would play every game until Round 6 where he suffered a season-ending injury against at Moorabbin Oval. 1986 saw Lindner back to his best as he cemented his place with The Cats, playing in eight of the first nine games of the season and kicking 13 goals before an injury against Hawthorn in Round 9 stopped his season. He made his comeback in Round 21, again against Hawthorn. Lindner was Geelong's leading goal kicker in 1987 with 62 goals. In 1987 he represented South Australia at interstate football with distinction, earning All Australian selection. He was All Australian again the following season for his performance in the Adelaide Bicentennial Carnival. Under coach Malcolm Blight, he played 18 games in 1989 and kicked 27 goals, and he was Geelong's leading possession player with 25 disposals in the 1989 VFL Grand Final loss to Hawthorn while playing across half back. Lindner left Geelong after the 1990 season and returned home to South Australia to play for the newly formed Adelaide Football Club. He was a member of their inaugural side which easily defeated defending premiers Hawthorn at Football Park. The Crows defeated The Hawks by 86 points 24.11 (155) to 9.15 (69). Lindner, playing in his preferred half forward, had 9 kicks and 6 handballs and kicked 4.2 (26) for The Crows in front of 44,902 fans at Football Park. Bruce would go on to play 11 games for Adelaide and kick 15 goals in 1991 season. Bruce Lindner played only 8 games for Adelaide in 1992 and played with West Adelaide when not selected or injured. He retired in 1993 after sustaining a broken leg in four places in a trail bike accident. References Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007). The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers. 7th ed.

A hashkafa, is a perspective that Orthodox Jews adopt that defines many aspects of their lives. Hashkafa thus plays a crucial role in how these interact with the world around them, and influences individual beliefs about secularity, gender roles, and modernity. In that it guides many practical decisions - where to send children to school, what synagogue to attend, and what community to live in - Hashkafa works in conjunction with halakha or Jewish law.  Origin and source  Although the word hashkafa is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, the idea of broad guiding philosophies certainly stems from it. Hashkafa is crucial because it contextualizes religiosity and makes Torah relevant intergenerationally. =Context= Although Orthodox communities prefer clinging to the mesorah (or Jewish tradition) more so than other Jewish denominations, they acknowledge that society has changed since the Revelation at Mount Sinai. Therefore, hashkafa is necessary to contextualize religious observance. Hashkafa works in conjunction with halakha‚Äî the codified list of laws and commandments derived from the Torah and the oral tradition‚Äîto direct and enrich the day-to-day life of Orthodox Jews. When a hashkafa is inconsistent with halakha, it is inherently illegitimate. While halakha is a rigid legal system that generally doesn't afford much variation in practice, hashkafa provides a more flexible framework, and is often the source of major disagreement between different Orthodox groups. For example, Orthodox halakhic authorities‚Äîor rabbis‚Äîprohibit listening to music with profane lyrics. However, there is disagreement about listening to \\"kosher\\" non-Jewish music, which is part of the broader hashkafic (i. e., relating to hashkafa) discussion about cultural integration. Modern Orthodox Jews will generally listen to such music, while Hasidic Jews will distance themselves from it. =Principles= The Torah lays the foundations for such a construct in Deuteronomy 6:18 (), where it says: \\"And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord.\\"JPS Bible English Translation. Online. Similarly, the Tanakh (or Hebrew Bible) mentions the phrase \\"walking in His Ways\\",Deuteronomy 8:6, 19:9, 26:17, 28:9, 30:16; Kings 1 2:3; Isaiah 42:24; Psalms 119:3. Print. in reference to God, eight times. These verses make no mention of any specific commandments like observing the Sabbath or celebrating Passover; rather, they command the more fundamental principles‚Äîor hashkafas'‚Äîof doing what is right and emulating God's ways. The prominent Jewish philosopher Nachmanides (Hebrew: ) argues that the reason the Torah writes in such broad strokes in the aforementioned cases is because it would be impossible for the Torah to legislate every possible circumstance for all times and places. Therefore, the Torah provided principles that can be used to judge specific and new situations in accordance with Torah Law.. Nachmanides Commentary on the Torah, Deuteronomy 6:18. Print. Leviticus 19:2 () describes another non-specific, all-encompassing meta-principle, stating, \\"Ye shall be holy.\\"JPS Bible English Translation. Once again, this verse does not mention a specific commandment; instead, it insists on leading a life centered around holiness. Here, Nachmanides expands on his previous comment: According to the letter of Torah law, drunkenness and gluttony (as examples) are permissible (as long as the wine is kosher and the meat is ritually slaughtered). Clearly, however, gluttony and drunkenness are against the spirit of the law, and acts such as these are incongruous with Torah. . Nachmanides Commentary on the Torah, Leviticus 19:2. Print. The more general implication is that one must consider as foundational and guiding, the principle of acting in a manner that is holy. This principle is referred to as lifnim mishurat hadin (‚Äúbeyond the line of the law‚Äù; ◊ú◊§◊†◊ô◊ù ◊û◊©◊ï◊®◊™ ◊î◊ì◊ô◊ü). See also the related concept that proper behavior precedes the Torah (◊ì◊®◊ö ◊ê◊®◊• ◊ß◊ì◊û◊î ◊ú◊™◊ï◊®◊î), meaning that before one can learn and put into practice the mitzvot of the Torah, he or she must pave the path with Derech Eretz, meaning decent behavior, good personality traits, and suchlike. Perhaps more broad, is Deuteronomy 10:12-13 (): :\\"And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul; to keep for thy good the commandments of the LORD, and His statutes, which I command thee this day?\\" Rashi comments that \\"fear\\" here corresponds to a belief in individualized Divine providence (Hashgachah Pratit; ). This, in turn, entails implications re the (Jewish) understanding of nature, and its reciprocal, the miraculous, clearly fundamental to any Hashkafa; again, practically as well as philosophically. Related to this is the injunction in Proverbs 3:6 to \\"know God in all your ways\\" (◊ë◊õ◊ú ◊ì◊®◊õ◊ô◊ö ◊ì◊¢◊î◊ï), interpreted as a foundation \\"on which all of Torah [practice] depends\\", ◊ë◊ë◊®◊õ◊ï◊™ ◊°◊í ◊¢\\"◊ê and requiring This idea is, in fact, codified as law in the Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 231; see also Kitzur Shulchan Aruch ch 31 that one must attempt to imbue with spirituality every interaction with the material world. See Divine providence in Judaism and Torah Im Derech Eretz #Derech Eretz. =Realizations= With the rise of Jewish philosophy and great Jewish thinkers, various sects of Orthodox Judaism have developed throughout history, each with their distinct hashkafa; see next section. While certain meta- principles - such as these above - are present in all sects‚Äîprimarily the ones precisely demarcated in the Torah and Talmud, others have been the subject of much disagreement, especially those that deal with pertinent and pressing issues. Despite the vast differences between Hasidism and Modern Orthodoxy, both are still considered legitimate. The idea that there can be more than one correct understanding is deeply rooted in Jewish texts. The most well known of such statements is from the Midrash‚Äîthe collection of exegesis of Torah taught by Rabbinical Sages of the post-temple era‚Äîin Bamidbar Rabbah 13:15, which explains that there are \\"seventy faces to Torah\\" (shivim panim la-Torah) . This perplexing statement is generally understood to mean that the nature of the Torah's truth is multifaceted. Similarly, the Babylonian Talmud states regarding a legal debate that \\"these and these are the words of the living Lord\\";Babylonian Talmud, Vilna Edition. Tractate Eruvin 13b. Print. in other words, both opinions are valid. Because no single hashkafa is believed to have a monopoly on the truth, great amount of philosophical flexibility is provided to Jewish thinkers, which results in different‚Äîsometimes even contradictory‚Äîhashkafas. Who may develop a new hashkafa is a complicated question that has been debated for centuries. Hashkafa must always be consistent with halakha; therefore, generally the most prominent rabbinic scholars of their times have successfully implemented new hashkafas because they are experts in both Jewish law and philosophy. Novel hashkafas seem to develop during periods of change and instability, within the Jewish community and within the larger society.  Broad Hashkafot  Although, as mentioned, there are numerous (\\"70\\") Hashkafas within Orthodox Judaism, they may be grouped broadly as Haredi, Hasidic and Modern Orthodox / Religious Zionist, with different approaches and emphases re the topics below. Other Hashkafas include Torah im Derech Eretz, Talmidei haRambam, and Carlbachian. = Modern Orthodox = Modern Orthodox is a stream of Orthodox Judaism that attempts to meld the secular, modern world with traditional Jewish values and the observance of Halakha, or Jewish law. Modern Orthodox Jews value secular knowledge and are culturally, educationally and politically, as well as practically, engaged in society. See Torah Umadda. Religious Zionism is an ideology that combines Zionism and Torah observance, and views secular activities, including military service, in support of the State of Israel as religiously important. Adherents are thus similarly engaged with secular (Israeli) society. Although not identical, these hashkafas share many of the same values. = Haredi Judaism = Haredi Judaism - also called Yeshivishe, Misnagid, or Litvishe - is a stream of Orthodox Judaism that essentially rejects modern secular culture. In contrast to Modern Orthodox Jews who embrace the modern world, Haredim follow a strict reading by segregating themselves from modern society. The emphasis is on Torah study and exact observance of Halakha, and secular interactions are thus limited to the practical, such as (circumscribed modes of) earning a living; see Torah im Derech Eretz #Earning a livelihood. There is however a gradation here: especially in Israel, Haredis are fully separated from secular society; in the Western world, Haredi life often realizes as Torah U‚ÄôParnasah, \\"Torah combined with a livelihood\\", sometimes extending to professional life with its requisite education  although many do choose full time kollel Torah study as in Israel. Haredi Judaism emerged in response to the Jewish assimilation and secularization during the Enlightenment era with hopes to decrease the influence of secular society on Judaism; see Moses Sofer #Influence against changes in Judaism. = Hasidic Judaism = Hasidic Judaism is a stream of Orthodox Judaism that focuses on spirituality and Jewish mysticism as a fundamental aspect of faith. Similar to Haredim, this community emphasizes observance of Halakha, and are insulated from the secular; in distinction though, their outlook, and hence practices, are influenced by their mysticism. As for the Haredi world, there is similarly a gradation re engagement with secular society: some branches such as Chabad and Breslov are actively engaged; groups such as Satmar are entirely isolated, often living in their own enclaves or even towns. As mentioned, Hasidic practice somewhat differs from that of the Haredi world, in that they additionally engage in spiritually uplifting activities, such as the communal Tish / Farbrengen, and individual practices such as Hitbodedut (meditation) and Mikveh (ritual immersion). They may be recognized by their unique black garb. Hasidism was founded in 18th- century Eastern Europe by Rabbi Israel Ben Eliezer, known as the Baal Shem Tov.  Specific topics  = Secular knowledge = Judaism values secular knowledge and non-Jews who study it. The Talmud, in Brachot 58a, says that one who sees a non-Jewish scholar should make this blessing: \\"Blessed be He who gave His wisdom to flesh and blood.\\" However, the extent to which a Jew should immerse himself in secular knowledge is contentious. Some argue that the pursuit of secular knowledge complements and refines the understanding of Jewish religious knowledge. This is a fundamental principle of Torah Umadda, an idea closely associated with Yeshiva University. Others view secular knowledge as a worthwhile endeavor as long as it serves a practical end, such as learning biology to become a physician. Yet others vehemently oppose pursuing secular knowledge, as they believe it is not valuable enough. Some even believe that secular knowledge is dangerous because it contains ideas that are antithetical to the Torah and can cause people to stray from their religious life. Evolution is one popular example. See Jewish views on evolution; Creationism #Judaism. = Modernity = Because Orthodox Judaism is so deeply entrenched in its tradition, the question of how to incorporate and adapt to modernity, in terms modern of culture and thought, lies at the center of disagreements between Orthodox groups. Modern Orthodox Jews view their interactions with the world around them and the development of society as an integral part of their theology. They do not view modernity as a threat; they embrace it. Modern Orthodox Jews are likely to view themselves as citizens of the modern world. Great Jewish thinkers such as Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch and Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik sometimes integrated modern thought into their worldview. Hasidism is generally opposed to the idea of integrating modern ideas and culture into their well-established theological thought. Hasidic Jews do not wear modern clothing, while Modern Orthodox Jews find no objection to it, provided that the clothing is modest. = Gender roles = The appropriate role of women in Jewish life and society at large varies across the spectrum of hashkafas. Hashkafas that more readily incorporate modern thought into Jewish life, tend to believe in greater gender equality. However, they will not ignore the framework of Halacha and sacrifice adherence to Jewish tradition for this end. Some hashkafas do not address or value gender equality; consequently, distinct gender roles are magnified. Many women, especially within the Hasidic community, take pride in their unique role as homemakers, and make their family and children their main focus. Currently, there is much disagreement about the educational curriculum for women, particularly if the Talmud may be studied by women. With the exception of Modern Orthodoxy, the majority of hashkafas do not allow women to study Talmud. See discussion under Midrasha #Curriculum. = Redemption = Since the emergence of the Zionist movement, many questions have arisen about the permissibility of an autonomous Jewish state in the Land of Israel prior to the arrival of the Messiah. This issue is especially complicated because the Jewish homeland is partly governed by secular Jews who are not strictly Orthodox. Modern-day Israel is thus a particularly antagonistic subject because the line between hashkafa and halakha in this area is blurry. There are some who oppose the State of Israel in its entirety, and reject its legitimacy; see Three Oaths. Religious Zionists and Modern Orthodox Jews view the State of Israel as the first step in the process of redemption; Torat Eretz Yisrael is a body of writing devoted to this topic. Certain Hasidic groups - Satmar is the best known - believe that an autonomous Jewish state in the Land of Israel is forbidden by Jewish law, and label Zionists as heretics. = Social life = For many within the Orthodox Jewish world, self-identity stems from subscribing to a specific hashkafa; therefore, hashkafa plays a central role in the social life of observant Jews. Hashkafas create cultures that can be very different. In the United States, Modern Orthodox Jews cluster to form tight-knit communities that have their own synagogues, high schools, and community centers. Hasidic Jews also tend to live amongst themselves because cross-cultural social integration is difficult. Jews of similar hashkafas prefer to live together because they share much in common. Marriage and dating: shidduchim Shidduchim, matching two people together for marriage, is heavily influenced by hashkafas. Jewish blogs are rife with posts about the marital compatibility of men and women who have different hashkafas. Dating websites, like JWed and JDate, require members to fill in a box about their hashkafa. People assume that if a husband and wife have similar hashafas, they will most likely have a happy marriage. Head covering: kippah Knitted Kippah Srugah or \\"Srugie\\" Although superficial and clich√©, the type of head covering that a man wears is believed to be an expression of the hashkafa he subscribes to. People who identify as Religious Zionists or Modern Orthodox often wear knitted, colored kippot (Hebrew plural of kippah). It is sometimes affectionately, and sometimes derogatorily, referred to as a \\"srugie\\" (i. e., \\"knitted\\" or \\"crocheted\\"). Men from more Yeshivishe or Haredi circles wear black, velvet ones. Many believe that kippot are self-conscious manifestations of a person's hashkafic orientation and social affiliation. This superficial, and often misguided, habit to pigeonhole people based on head coverings has been criticized.Black Velvet \\"Yarmulke\\" Non-Orthodox Hashkafas Taken at its broadest and simplest definition, hashkafa is the overarching Torah principles that guide human action. In that sense of the word, the term hashkafa is significant to almost all Jewish denominations who mutually associate with certain principles listed in the Torah, especially on a humanistic and philosophical level. One such example is the principle of tikkun olam‚Äîtaken to mean fixing the world and making it a better place‚Äîwhich is a nonsectarian belief. Reform Jews, Conservative Jews, and Orthodox Jews all value and emphasize this principle, but each endeavor to fulfill this concept differently based upon their respective traditions. Reform Judaism focuses on social action within the larger global community, while certain Orthodox groups might reject such efforts as unnecessary.

Biography De Luca was born at Venosa, Basilicata, in 1614 of humble parentage. He took up the study of law at Naples in 1635. After graduation, he practiced law as an advocate in Naples for five years. An attack of pulmonary tuberculosis caused him to return to his native place, where he took up the bishop's vicariate. In 1645 De Luca went to Rome, where he soon won a high reputation for his legal ability and became one of Italy's pre-eminent advocates. As a close collaborator of the reform-minded pope Innocent XI, who acceded to the Holy See in 1676, he exerted influence over the organisation of the Roman Curia, but stirred up much enmity and jealousy among the conservative leaders of the Church, notably Innocent's secretary Agostino Favoriti. This caused his influence to wane over time. At an advanced age he became a priest and was made first referendary Utriusque Signaturae, then auditor of the Sacred Palace by Innocent, who finally in 1681 raised De Luca to the cardinalate. He died at Rome, on 5 February 1683. Works Monument to Giovanni Battista de Luca in Rome, Santo Spirito dei Napoletani, by Domenico Guidi, 1683. De Luca's writings, which are eminently practical in character, are most important for proper understanding of the jurisprudence of the Roman Curia and especially of the Rota Romana in his time. They include his \\"Relatio Curiae Romanae\\" (Cologne, 1683), \\"Sacrae Rotae decisiones\\" (Lyons, 1700) and \\"Annotationes praticae ad S. Conciluim Tridentinum\\" (Cologne, 1684). His complete works were published under the title \\"Theatrum veritatis et justitiae (19 volumes, 1669‚Äì77; 12 volumes, Cologne, 1689‚Äì99); a comprehensive legal encyclopedia that became one of the most significant authorities of the late ius commune and was reprinted regularly up until the middle of the 18th century. De Luca also advocated the use of the Italian language in scientific publications and authored numerous works in Italian providing a comprehensive picture of the legal and institutional framework of his time. * Il Dottor volgare, Roma, 1673. * Dello stile legale, Roma, 1674. * Difesa della lingua italiana, Roma, 1675. * Il cavaliere e la dama, Roma, 1675. * Il vescovo pratico, Roma, 1675. * Il religioso pratico, Roma, 1679. * Il Principe cristiano pratico, Roma, 1680. * Il cardinale della S.R.

Written in 1903‚Äì1905, it was originally staged at the Royal Court Theatre in 1905 featuring Mabel Hackney, and revived at the same venue in 1965, the Royal Exchange, Manchester in 1989 and at the National Theatre in 1989, and in 2006. In 2006, American playwright David Mamet wrote what a critic for The New York Times called a \\"canny new adaptation\\" of the play for New York's Atlantic Theatre Company. Described by Samuel French as \\"a witty, impeccably crafted portrait of a family in the midst of a surprisingly modern moral dilemma\\", its subject is financial fraud, on which Ian Clarke wrote, \\"in The Voysey Inheritance, the dishonesty implicates not only the individual Voyseys but the institutions, ideology, and economic base of Edwardian England\\". Plot Edward's highly principled world upturns when he discovers the family business he is inheriting has been defrauding its clients for years because his father has been illegally speculating with their money. To compound matters, he quickly discovers his large, scandal-fearing family knew of the crime but allowed it to continue rather than face the shame of public disclosure. Quote \\"Of course it's pleasant and comfortable to keep within the law . . . then the law will look after you. Otherwise you have to look pretty sharp after yourself. You have to cultivate your own sense of right and wrong . . . deal with your own justice. But that makes a bigger man of you, let me tell you.\\"  See also  * Complete text on Internet Archive References English plays 1905 plays ","title":"The Voysey Inheritance"},{"id":"12808119","text":"Midland League. Players include Quentin Neill (seated, second right) and John Irving (on ground, centre). Lincoln City Football Club, an English association football club based in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, was founded in 1884, and first entered the FA Cup in the 1884‚Äì85 season. When nationally organised league football in England began, the club joined the Combination, a league set up to provide organised football for those clubs not invited to join the Football League which was to start the same year. When that league folded, Lincoln became one of the founder members of the Midland League, and won the inaugural league title. They then spent a year in the Football Alliance before being elected to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League. Lincoln moved in and out of the Football League until they became founder members of the Football League Third Division North in 1921. They remained in the Football League until 1987, when they became the first club to suffer automatic relegation to the Football Conference. They returned to the League after just one season, remained at that level until they were again relegated in 2011, and returned once more in 2017. All players who have made at least 100 appearances in senior first-team matches for Lincoln City, in league or cup competition, are listed below. Grant Brown holds the record for Lincoln City appearances, having played 491 matches between 1989 and 2002, of which 407 were in the Football League. Tony Emery is the only other Lincoln player with more than 400 Football League appearances, and he and Dave Smith the only other two with 400 competitive appearances in total. The goalscoring record is held by Andy Graver, with 143 league goals, and 150 in total, scored over three spells with the club between 1950 and 1961. Johnny Campbell is the only other Lincoln player to have scored 100 Football League goals. Goalkeeper David Felgate is the only man in this appearance range to have played senior international football while with Lincoln City; he received his only cap for Wales as a half-time substitute for Neville Southall in a friendly against Romania in 1983.

The libretto is based on Beckett's 1958 play Krapp's Last Tape, and large portions of the play's script were lifted for use in the libretto. Like the play, the opera is a monologue with the only character being that of Krapp. The opera was commissioned jointly by the Radiodiffusion-T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise and the Bielefeld Opera, Germany. From the very beginning the opera's libretto has existed in three different languages: English (from the original play), French (for the French premiere) and German (for the German premiere).Damned to Fame by James Knowlson It premiered using the French-language version on RTF radio on 15 May 1961 and had its stage debut in Paris on 3 July 1961 at the Th√©√¢tre des Nations.

Composing the opera Mihalovici had asked Beckett if he would write a new libretto for him. Beckett agreed but, not unsurprisingly, found he was unable to write to order. Instead, he persuaded Mihalovici to write music for an existing work and the composer \\"chose La Derni√®re Bande because of the new musical possibilities involved in a character who must sing as both a young and an old man, and whose voice on tape must be accompanied by a live orchestra.\\"Barney Rosset, 5 Jan. 1972, as qtd. in Deirdre Bair, Samuel Beckett: A Biography (London: Vintage, 1990) 535, 536. It took some fourteen months for the Krapp: ou La derni√®re bande, a score of almost 260 pages, to be completed. From that point, according to James Knowlson, \\"Beckett and his German translator Elmar Tophoven ‚Ä¶ [literally] sat at the piano, one on either side of the composer, adapting the text to the music or modifying the score ‚Ä¶ Beckett sometimes changed his original English text to provide extra 'notes' or different rhythms: so, [for example,] 'incomparable bosom' became 'a bosom beyond compare'.\\"James Knowlson, Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 467. \\"Mihalovici's music is atonal, sparse and highly descriptive, relying heavily on a huge percussion battery to paint a pungent landscape for Beckett's moods and words. Beats on wooden blocks suggest a human heartbeat, a swirling celesta the dizziness of inebriation, muted trumpets a nauseating anxiety. Inner torture and pain are revealed through the orchestra as Krapp intones Sprechgesang in the present; a lyrical vocal line caresses the pre-recorded monologues of his younger self. The melody for the section of tape which Krapp rewinds and re-listens to numerous times (his happiest moment, curled up with his lover in a gently rocking boat) is ingeniously captured as an id√©e fixe by Mihalovici.\\" References Operas One-act operas 1961 operas French- language operas German-language operas English-language operas Chamber operas Operas by Marcel Mihalovici Samuel Beckett ","title":"Krapp, ou, La derni√®re bande"},{"id":"12808217","text":"Lambert of St-Bertin was a French Benedictine chronicler and abbot. Biography Lambert was born about 1060 of a distinguished family, and, when still young, entered the French Benedictine abbey of St-Bertin. He afterwards visited several famous schools in France, having first laid the foundation of his subsequent learning by the study in his own monastery of grammar, theology and music. For some time he filled the office of prior, and in 1095 was chosen abbot at once by the monks of St-Bertin and by the canons of St-Omer. He was thus drawn into closer relations with Cluny, and instituted through the Cluniac monks many reforms in his somewhat deteriorated monastery. Needless to say, he encountered no little opposition to his efforts, but, thanks to his extraordinary energy, he finally secured acceptance for his views, and rehabilitated the financial position of the monastery. He was a friend of St. Anselm and exchanged verses, still extant, with the poet Reginald of Canterbury (ed. Libermann in \\"Neues Archiv der Gesellschaft fur altere Geschichte\\", XIII, 1888, pp. 528; 531-34). He died on 22 June 1125, at St- Bertin.

The third son of Ismail I (), he was Sultan between 1333 and 1354, after his brother Muhammad IV () was assassinated. Coming to the throne at age fifteen, he was initially treated as a minor and given only limited power by his ministers and his grandmother Fatima. In February 1334, his representatives secured a four- year peace treaty with Granada's neighbours Castile and the Marinid Sultanate; which was joined by Aragon in May. After gaining more control of the government, in 1338 or 1340 he expelled the Banu Abi al-Ula family, who had masterminded the murder of his brother and been the leaders of the Volunteers of the Faith‚ÄîNorth African soldiers who fought for Granada. After the treaty expired, he allied himself with Abu al-Hasan Ali () of the Marinids against Alfonso XI of Castile (). After winning a major naval victory in April 1340, the Marinid-Granadan alliance was decisively defeated on 30 October, in the disastrous Battle of R√≠o Salado. In its aftermath, Yusuf was unable to prevent Castile from taking several Granadan castles and towns, including Alcal√° de Benzaide, Locub√≠n, Priego, and Benamej√≠. In 1342‚Äì1344, Alfonso XI besieged the strategic port of Algeciras. Yusuf led his troops in diversionary raids into Castilian territory, and later engaged the besieging army, but the city fell in March 1344. A ten-year peace treaty with Castile followed. In 1349, Alfonso XI broke the treaty and invaded again, laying siege to Gibraltar. Yusuf was responsible for supplying the besieged port, and led counter-attacks into Castile. The siege was lifted when Alfonso XI died of the Black Death in March 1350. Out of respect, Yusuf ordered his commanders to not attack the Castilian army as they retreated from Granadan territories carrying their king's body. Yusuf signed a treaty with Alfonso's son and successor Peter I (), even sending his troops to suppress a domestic rebellion against the Castilian king, as required by the treaty. His relation with the Marinids deteriorated when he provided refuge for the rebellious brothers of Sultan Abu Inan Faris (). He was assassinated by a madman while praying in the Great Mosque of Granada, on the day of Eid al-Fitr, 19 October 1354. In contrast to the military and territorial losses suffered during his reign, the emirate flourished in the fields of literature, architecture, medicine, and the law. Among other new buildings, he constructed the Madrasa Yusufiyya inside the city of Granada, as well as the Tower of Justice and various additions to the Comares Palace of the Alhambra. Major cultural figures served in his court, including the Abu Nu'aym Ridwan, as well as the poet Ibn al-Jayyab and the polymath Ibn al-Khatib, who consecutively served as his viziers. Modern historians consider his reign, and that of his son Muhammad V (), as the golden era of the Emirate. Early life alt=A large fortress/palace complex. Abu al-Hajjaj Yusuf ibn Ismail was born on 29 June 1318 (28 Rabi al-Thani 718 AH) in the Alhambra, the fortified royal palace complex of the Nasrid dynasty of the Emirate of Granada. He was the third son of the reigning sultan, Ismail I, and a younger brother of the future Muhammad IV. Ismail had four sons and two daughters, but Yusuf was the only child of his mother, Bahar. She was an (freed concubine) originally from the Christian lands, described as \\"noble in good deeds, chastity, and equanimity\\" by Yusuf's vizier, the historian Ibn al- Khatib. When Ismail was assassinated in 1325, he was succeeded by the ten-year old Muhammad, who ruled until he too was assassinated in 25 August 1333, when he was en route back to Granada after repulsing a Castilian siege of Gibraltar, jointly with the Marinids of Morocco. Ibn al-Khatib described the young Yusuf as \\"white-skinned, naturally strong, had a fine figure and an even finer character\\", with large eyes, dark straight hair, and a thick beard. He further wrote that Yusuf liked to \\"dress with elegance\\", was interested in art, architecture, a \\"collector of arms\\", and \\"had some mechanical ability\\". Before his accession, Yusuf lived in his mother's house.  Background  alt=Colored map of the Iberian Peninsula and Western North Africa Founded by Muhammad I in the 1230s, the Emirate of Granada was the last Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula. Through a combination of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, the emirate succeeded in maintaining its independence, despite being located between two larger neighbours: the Christian Crown of Castile to the north and the Muslim Marinid Sultanate across the sea in Morocco. Granada intermittently entered into alliance or went to war with both of these powers, or encouraged them to fight one another, in order to avoid being dominated by either. From time to time, the sultans of Granada swore fealty and paid tribute to the kings of Castile, an important source of income for Castile. From Castile's point of view, Granada was a royal vassal, while Muslim sources never described the relationship as such. Muhammad I, for instance, on occasion declared his fealty to other Muslim sovereigns. Yusuf's predecessor, Muhammad IV, sought help from the Marinid Sultanate to counter a threat by an alliance of Castile and the powerful Granadan commander Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula, who supported a pretender to the throne in a civil war. In exchange for the Marinid alliance, he had to yield Ronda, Marbella, and Algeciras. Subsequently, the Marinid‚ÄìGranadan forces captured Gibraltar and fended off a Castilian attempt to retake it, before signing a peace treaty with Alfonso XI of Castile and Abu al-Hasan Ali of the Marinids the day before his assassination. While the actual killing of Muhammad IV was carried out by a slave named Zayyan, the instigators were Muhammad's own commanders, Abu Thabit ibn Uthman and Ibrahim ibn Uthman. They were the sons of Uthman ibn Abi al- Ula, who died in 1330, and his successors as the leaders of the Volunteers of the Faith, the corps of North Africans fighting on the Iberian Peninsula for Granada. According to Ibn Khaldun, the two brothers decided to kill Yusuf due to his closeness to the Marinid Sultan Abu al-Hasan‚Äîtheir political enemy‚Äîwhile according to Castilian chronicles it was because of the friendly way he treated Alfonso XI at the conclusion of the siege. As a result of Muhammad's cessions to the Marinids and the taking of Gibraltar, the Marinids had sizeable garrisons and territories on traditionally Granadan lands in Al- Andalus (the Muslim-controlled part of the Iberian Peninsula). Their control of Algeciras and Gibraltar‚Äîtwo ports of the Strait of Gibraltar‚Äîgave them ability to move troops easily between North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. The control of these ports and the waters surrounding them was also an important objective for Alfonso XI, who wanted to halt the North African intervention in the peninsula.  Accession  The Nasrid dynasty of Granada had no specific rule of succession, and the sources are silent as to why Yusuf was chosen over Ismail's second son Faraj, who was a year older. There are differing reports of where Yusuf was proclaimed and who selected him. According to the historians L. P. Harvey and Brian Catlos, who follow the report of the Castilian chronicles, the (chamberlain) Abu Nu'aym Ridwan, who was present at Muhammad IV's assassination, rode quickly to the capital Granada, arriving on the same day, and after consultation with Fatima bint al- Ahmar (Ismail's mother, and grandmother of Muhammad and Yusuf) arranged for the declaration of Yusuf as the new sultan. The proclamation took place the next day, 26 August (14 Dhu al-Hijja 733 AH). Another modern historian, Francisco Vidal Castro, writes that that the declaration and the oath of allegiance took place in the Muslim camp near Gibraltar instead of in the capital, and that the instigators of the assassination, the Banu Abi al-Ula brothers, were the ones who proclaimed him. Coming to the throne at the age of fifteen, Yusuf was initially treated as a minor and, according to Ibn al- Khatib, his authority was limited to only \\"choosing the food to eat from his table\\". His grandmother, Fatima, and the Ridwan became his tutors and exercised some powers of government, together with other ministers. Upon his accession he took the (honorific or regnal name) al-Mu'ayyad billah (\\"He who is aided by God\\"). The founder of the dynasty Muhammad I, had taken a (al- Ghalib billah, \\"Victor by the grace of God\\") but the subsequent sultans up to Yusuf did not adopt this practice. After Yusuf this was done by almost all of the Nasrid sultans. According to the Castilian chronicles, Yusuf immediately requested the protection of Abu al-Hasan, his late brother's ally.  Political and military events  = Early peace = alt=Colored map of the southern part of Spain annotated with borders and various cities. The peace that Muhammad IV secured after the siege of Gibraltar was, by the principles of the time, rendered void by his death, and representatives of Yusuf met with those of Alfonso XI and Abu al-Hasan Ali. They signed a new treaty at Fez, the capital of the Marinid Sultanate, on 26 February 1334 with a four-year duration. Like previous treaties, it authorised free trade between the three kingdoms, but unusually, it did not include payments of tribute from Granada to Castile. Marinid ships were to be given access to Castilian ports, and the Marinid Sultan Abu al-Hasan promised not to increase his garrisons on the Iberian Peninsula‚Äîbut he could still rotate them. The latter condition was favourable not only to Castile but also to Granada, which was wary of possible expansionism by the larger Marinid Sultanate into the peninsula. Additionally, Alfonso IV of Aragon () agreed to join the treaty in May 1334, and signed his own agreement with Yusuf on 3 June 1335. After Alfonso IV's death in January 1336, his son Peter IV () renewed the bilateral Granadan‚ÄìAragonese treaty for five years, ushering in a period of peace between Granada and all its neighbours. With the treaty in place, the monarchs redirected their attentions elsewhere: Alfonso XI cracked down on his rebellious nobles, while Abu al- Hasan waged war against the Zayyanid Kingdom of Tlemcen in North Africa. During these years, Yusuf acted against the Banu Abi al-Ula family, the masterminds of Muhammad IV's assassination. In September 1340 (or 1338), Abu Thabit ibn Uthman was removed from his post as the overall Chief of the Volunteers and replaced by Yahya ibn Umar of the Banu Rahhu family. Abu Thabit was expelled along with his three brothers and the entire family to the Hafsid Kingdom of Tunis. Harvey comments that \\"[b]y the standards of acts of revenge in those days ... this was quite restrained\\", probably because Yusuf did not want to unnecessarily create tensions with the North African volunteers. = Marinid‚ÄìGranadan war against Castile = In the spring of 1339, after the expiration of the treaty, hostilities recommenced with Marinid raids into the Castilian countryside. Confrontations ensued between Castile on one side and the two Muslim kingdoms on the other. Granada was invaded by Castilian troops led by Gonzalo Mart√≠nez, Master of the Order of Alc√°ntara, who raided Locub√≠n, Alcal√° de Benzaide and Priego. In turn, Yusuf led an army of 8,000 in besieging Siles, but was forced to lift the siege by the forces of the Master of the Order of Santiago, Alfonso M√©ndez de Guzm√°n. The personal rivalry between Mart√≠nez and de Guzm√°n appears to have caused the former to defect to Yusuf, but he was soon captured by Castillian forces, hung as a traitor and his body burned. The Marinid commander on the peninsula, Abu Malik Abd al- Wahid, son of Abu al-Hasan, died during a battle with Castile on 20 October 1339, but Marinid forces continued to ravage the Castilian frontiers until they were defeated at Jerez. At the same time, Nasrid forces achieved military successes, including the conquest of Carcabuey. In autumn 1339, the Aragonese fleet under Jofre Gillabert tried to land near Algeciras but was driven away after their admiral was killed. On 8 April 1340, a major battle took place off Algeciras between the Castilian fleet under Alfonso Jofr√© Tenorio and a larger Marinid‚ÄìGranadan fleet under Muhammad al-Azafi, resulting in a Muslim victory and the death of Tenorio. The Muslim fleet captured 28 galleys out of the 44 in the Castilian fleet, and 7 carracks. Abu al-Hasan saw the naval victory as a harbinger for the conquest of Castile. He crossed the Strait of Gibraltar with his army, including siege engines, his wives, and his entire court. He landed in Algeciras on 4 August, was joined by Yusuf, and laid siege on Tarifa, a Castilian port on the Strait, on 23 September. Alfonso XI marched to relieve Tarifa, joined by Portuguese troops led by his ally, King Afonso IV of Portugal (). They arrived from Tarifa on 29 October, and Yusuf and Abu al- Hasan moved to meet them. Alfonso XI commanded 8,000 horsemen, 12,000 foot soldiers and an unknown number of urban militia, while Afonso IV had 1,000 men. The Muslim strength is unclear: contemporary Christian sources claimed an exaggerated 53,000 horsemen and 600,000 foot soldiers; while modern historian Ambrosio Huici Miranda in 1956 estimated 7,000 Granadan troops and 60,000 Moroccans. Crucially, the Christian knights had much better armour than the more lightly equipped Muslim cavalry.  Battle of R√≠o Salado  alt=A battle scene with cavalry and foot soldiers in the foreground. The resulting Battle of R√≠o Salado (also known as the Battle of Tarifa), on 30 October 1340, was a decisive Christian victory. Yusuf, who wore a golden helmet in the battle, fled the field after a charge by the Portuguese troops. The Granadan contingent initially defended itself and was about to defeat Afonso IV in a counterattack, but was routed when Christian reinforcements arrived, leaving their Marinid allies behind. The Marinids too were routed in the main battle against the Castilians, which lasted from 9 a.m. to noon. Harvey opined that the key to the Christian victory‚Äîdespite their numeric disadvantage‚Äîwas their cavalry tactics and superior armour. Muslim tactics‚Äîwhich focused on lightly armoured, highly mobile cavalry‚Äîwere well suited for open battle, but in the relatively narrow battlefield of R√≠o Salado the Christian formation of armoured knights attacking in a well-formed battle line had a decisive advantage. In the aftermath of the battle, the Christian troops pillaged the Muslim camp, and massacred the women and children, including Abu al-Hasan's queen, Fatima, the daughter of King Abu Bakr II of Tunis‚Äîto the dismay of their commanders, who would have preferred to see her ransomed. Numerous royal persons and nobles were captured, including Abu al-Hasan's son, Abu Umar Tashufin. Among the fallen were many of Granada's intellectuals and officials. Yusuf retreated to his capital through Marbella. Abu al-Hasan marched to Gibraltar, sent news of victory back home to prevent any rebellion in his absence, and crossed the Strait to Ceuta the same night. Various Muslim authors laid the blame on the Marinid Sultan, with Umar II of Tlemcen saying that he \\"humiliated the head of Islam and filled the idolaters with joy\\", and al-Maqqari commenting that he allowed his army to be \\"scattered like dust before the wind\\". Yusuf appeared to not have been blamed, and continued to be popular in Granada. Alfonso XI returned victorious to Seville and paraded the Muslim captives and the booty taken by his army. There was so much gold and silver that their prices as far away as Paris and Avignon fell by one sixth. = After R√≠o Salado = With the bulk of the Marinid forces retreating to North Africa, Alfonso XI was able to act freely against Granada. He invaded the emirate in April 1341, feigning an attack against M√°laga. When Yusuf reinforced this western port‚Äîtaking many men from elsewhere‚ÄîAlfonso redirected his troops towards Alcal√° de Benzaide, a major border fortress north of Granada, whose garrison had been reduced in order to reinforce M√°laga. The Castilian army started a siege and ravaged the surrounding countryside, not only taking food but also destroying vines‚Äîcausing lasting damage to the local agriculture without any benefit to the attackers. In response, Yusuf moved to a strong position in Pinos Puente to block Castilian attempts to raid further into the rich plains surrounding the city of Granada. Alfonso XI extended the raids into more areas in order to tempt Yusuf to leave his position, but the Granadan army held its ground as the Castilians devastated the area surrounding Locub√≠n and Illora. As the siege progressed, Yusuf received Marinid reinforcements from Algeciras and moved to Mocl√≠n. Neither side was willing to risk a frontal attack, and Alfonso unsuccessfully tried to provoke Yusuf into an ambush. With relief unlikely, the Muslim defenders of Alcal√° offered to surrender the fortress in exchange for safe conduct, to which Alfonso agreed; the capitulation took place on 20 August 1341. Yusuf then offered a truce, but Alfonso demanded that he break his alliance with the Marinids, which Yusuf refused to do, and the war continued. Concurrently with the siege of Alcal√°, Alfonso's troops also captured the nearby Locub√≠n. In the weeks after the fall of Alcal√°, the Castilians captured Priego, Carcabuey, Matrera, and Benamej√≠. In May 1342, a Marinid-Granadan fleet sailing in the Strait of Gibraltar was ambushed by Castilian and Genoese ships, resulting in a Christian victory, the destruction of twelve galleys, and the dispersal of other vessels along the Granadan coast. = Siege of Algeciras = alt=Map of the Strait of Gibraltar with its ports annotated in various colours. Alfonso XI then targeted Algeciras, an important port on the Strait of Gibraltar which his father, Ferdinand IV, had failed to take in 1309‚Äì10. Alfonso arrived in early August 1342 and slowly imposed a land and sea blockade on the city. Yusuf's army took to the field, joined by Marinid troops from Ronda, trying to threaten the besiegers from the rear or divert their attention. Between November 1342 and February 1343, it raided the lands around √âcija, entered and sacked Palma del R√≠o, retook Benamej√≠ and captured Estepa. In June, Yusuf sent his , Ridwan, to Alfonso, offering payments in exchange for the lifting of the siege. Alfonso countered the offer by increasing the payment he would require. Yusuf sailed to North Africa to consult with Abu al-Hasan and raise the money, but the payment from the Marinid Sultan was not enough. Despite the safe conduct given by Alfonso, Yusuf's galley was attacked by a Genoese ship in Alfonso's service, which tried to steal the gold. Yusuf's ships repulsed the attack; Alfonso apologised but did not take any action against the Genoese ship's captain. The Muslim defenders of Algeciras made use of cannons, one of the earliest recorded uses of this weapon in a major European confrontation‚Äîbefore their better-known use at the Battle of Cr√©cy in 1346. Alfonso's forces were augmented by crusading contingents from all over Europe, including from both France and England, which were at war. Among European nobles present were King Philip III of Navarre, Gaston, Count of Foix, the Earl of Salisbury and the Earl of Derby. On 12 December 1343, Yusuf crossed the Palmones River and engaged a Castilian detachment. This was reported in Castilian sources as a Muslim defeat. Early in 1344, Alfonso constructed a floating barrier, made of trees chained together, that stopped supplies from reaching Algeciras. With the hope of victory fading and the city on the verge of starvation, Yusuf began negotiations again. He sent an envoy, named Hasan Algarrafa in Castilian chronicles, and offered the surrender of Algeciras if its inhabitants were allowed to leave with their movable property, in exchange for a fifteen-year peace between Granada, Castile, and the Marinids. Despite being counselled to reject the offer, and instead to take Algeciras by storm and massacre its inhabitants, Alfonso was aware of the uncertain outcome of an assault when hostile forces were nearby. He agreed to Algarrafa's proposal, but requested that the truce be limited to ten years, which Yusuf accepted. Other than Yusuf and Alfonso, the treaty included Abu al-Hasan, Peter IV, and the Doge of Genoa. Yusuf and Alfonso signed the treaty on 25 March 1344 in the Castilian camp outside Algeciras. = Siege of Gibraltar and related events = War broke out again in Granada in 1349, when Alfonso declared that the peace treaty no longer prevented him from attacking Muslim territories because the Marinid Iberian territories were now controlled by Abu Inan Faris, Abu al- Hasan's son, who had rebelled and seized Fez the year before. In June or July 1349, his forces began the siege of Gibraltar, a port which had been captured by Ferdinand IV in 1309 before falling to the Marinids in 1333. Prior to the siege, Yusuf sent archers and foot soldiers to reinforce the town's garrison. In July, Alfonso was personally present among the besiegers, and in the same month he ordered his Kingdom of Murcia to attack Yusuf's Granada. Despite Yusuf's protests, Peter IV sent an Aragonese fleet to assist the siege, even though in order to respect the peace treaty with Yusuf he instructed his men not to harm any subject of Granada. With the Marinids unable to send help, the main responsibility for fighting Castile fell to Yusuf, who led his troops in a series of counter-attacks. During the summer of 1349 he raided the outskirts of Alcaraz and Quesada, and besieged √âcija. In the winter he sent Ridwan to besiege Ca√±ete la Real, which surrendered after two days. As the siege progressed, the Black Death (known in Spain as the ), which had entered Iberian ports in 1348, struck the besiegers' camp. Alfonso persisted in the siege despite the urgings of his counselors. He became infected himself and died on Good Friday 1350 (26 March), or the day before. The Castilian forces withdrew from Gibraltar, with some of the defenders coming out to watch. Out of respect, Yusuf ordered his army and his commanders in the border regions not to attack the Castilian procession as it travelled with the King's body to Seville. Alfonso was succeeded by his fifteen-year-old son, Peter I. Yusuf, Peter, and Abu Inan of the Marinids concluded a treaty in 17 July 1350, which was to last until 1 January 1357. Trade was reopened between Granada and Castile (except for horses, arms, and wheat), and captives were exchanged. In exchange for peace, Yusuf paid tribute to Peter and agreed to provide 300 light horsemen when requested, but Yusuf did not formally become Peter's vassal. Despite privately disliking Peter, Yusuf observed his treaty obligations: he sent 300 cavalry‚Äîreluctantly, according to the historian Joseph O'Callaghan‚Äîto help the Castilian king suppress the rebellion of Alfonso Fern√°ndez Coronel in Aguilar, and refused to help the King's half- brother, Henry, when he attempted to start a rebellion against Peter from Algeciras. = Yusuf and the Marinid princes = Abu al-Hasan tried unsuccessfully to regain the Marinid throne until his death in 1351. Two other challengers to Abu Inan, his brothers Abu al-Fadl and Abu Salim, fled to Granada. Yusuf refused pressure from the Marinid Sultan to hand them over. Like many other Nasrid sultans, Yusuf found that the presence of Marinid pretenders in his court gave him leverage in case the two states came into conflict. At Yusuf's encouragement, Abu al-Fadl then went to Castile to seek help from Peter. Peter, seeking to incite another civil war in North Africa, provided ships to land the prince in Sus in order to attack Abu Inan. The Marinid Sultan was extremely angered by Yusuf's actions but felt unable to take action, knowing that he was supported by Castile. Abu al-Fadl was subsequently captured by Abu Inan and executed in 1354 or 1355. Abu Salim eventually became sultan in 1359‚Äì1361, well after Yusuf's death. Architecture Partal.alt=A tower like building alt=A small room with some Arabic decoration on the wall Yusuf constructed the Bab al-Sharia (now the Tower of Justice) in the Alhambra in 1348, forming the grand entrance to the complex. He also built what is now the Broken Tower () of the Citadel of the Alhambra, and the Tower of the Captive on the ramparts. He also carried out work in the Comares Palace, including renovations of the its hammam (bathhouse), as well as the construction of the Hall of the Comares, also known as the Chamber of the Ambassadors, the largest Nasrid structure in the complex. He built various new walls and towers to accommodate his enlargement of the Comares, and adorned many of the courts and halls of the Alhambra, as may be seen from the repeated appearance of his name in the inscriptions on the walls. Also in the Alhambra, he built the small prayer hall () of the Partal Palace, and what is now the Gate of the Seven Floors. In 1349, he founded a religious school, the Madrasa Yusufiyya, near the Great Mosque of Granada (now Granada Cathedral), providing higher education comparable to that of the medieval universities in Bologna, Paris, and Oxford. Only its prayer room remains today. He built al-Funduq al-Jadida (\\"the new \\"), today's Corral del Carb√≥n in the city of Granada, the only remaining caravanserai from the Nasrid era. Outside Granada, he enlarged the Alcazaba of M√°laga, the ancestral home of his paternal grandfather, Abu Said Faraj, the former governor of M√°laga, as well as the city's Gibralfaro precinct. Yusuf also constructed new defensive structures throughout his realm, including new towers, gates, and barbicans, especially after the defeat of R√≠o Salado. He reinforced existing castles and walls, as well as coastal defences. The Ridwan built forty watchtowers (), stretching the entire length of the Emirate's southern coast. Yusuf reinforced the city walls of Granada, as well as the Bab Ilbira (now the Gate of Elvira) and the Bab al-Ramla (the Gate of the Ears).  Administration  Yusuf's administration was supported by numerous ministers, including \\"a constellation of major cultural figures\\", according to Fern√°ndez-Puertas. Among them was Ridwan, who held the post of (chamberlain), a title created for the first time in the Nasrid rule for him by Muhammad IV and which outranked that of the vizier and other ministers. The had command of the army in the absence of the sultan. He was dismissed and imprisoned after the defeat at R√≠o Salado; he was freed a year later but then refused Yusuf's offer to reappoint him as vizier. The next , Abu al-Hasan ibn al-Mawl, came from a prominent family but proved unskilled in political matters. He was dismissed after a few months and fled to North Africa to avoid the intrigues of his rivals. The office of remained vacant until Ridwan regained it under Yusuf's successor Muhammad V (first reign, 1354‚Äì1359); following Ridwan's assassination in 1359, the post again disappeared until the appointment of Abu al-Surrur Mufarrij by Yusuf III (). The famous poet Ibn al-Jayyab was appointed as vizier in 1341, becoming the highest-ranked minister and the mastermind of Yusuf's cautious policy after R√≠o Salado. He was also the royal secretary, therefore he was titled (\\"the holder of the two vizierates\\"). The Black Death struck the emirate in 1348 and outbreaks were recorded in its three largest cities: Granada, M√°laga, and Almer√≠a. The epidemic killed many scholars and officials, including Ibn al-Jayyab who died in 1349. In accordance with his wishes, he was succeeded as both vizier and royal secretary by his prot√©g√©, Ibn al- Khatib. Ibn al-Khatib had entered the court chancery () in 1340, replacing his father who died at R√≠o Salado and serving under Ibn al-Jayyab. After becoming vizier he was also appointed to other posts, such as superintendent of the finances. The \\"preeminent writer and intellectual of fourteenth-century al- Andalus\\" according to Catlos, throughout his lifetime Ibn al-Khatib produced works in subjects as diverse as history, poetry, medicine, manners, mysticism, and philosophy. With access to official documents and the court archives, he remains one of the main historical sources on the Emirate of Granada. Yusuf received his subjects publicly twice each week, on Monday and Thursday, to listen to their concerns, assisted by his ministers and members of the royal family. According to Shihab al-Din al-'Umari, these hearings included the recitation of a tenth of the Quran and some parts of the hadith. On solemn state occasions, Yusuf presided over court activities from a wooden folding armchair that is currently preserved in the Museum of the Alhambra and bears the Nasrid coat of arms across its back. Between April and May 1347, he made a state visit to his eastern regions, with the main purpose of inspecting the fortifications in this part of his realm. Accompanied by his court, he visited twenty places in twenty-two days, including the port of Almer√≠a, where he was well received by the populace. Ibn al-Khatib describes other anecdotes that illustrate Yusuf's popularity, including his reception by a well-respected judge in Purchena, by the people‚Äîincluding common womenfolk‚Äîof Guadix in 1354, and by certain Christian merchants in the same year. According to Vidal Castro, gold coins bearing Yusuf's name had particularly beautiful designs, many of which are still found today (one example is provided in the infobox of this article). In diplomacy, for the first time in Nasrid history he sent an embassy to the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo. A surviving copy of a letter from the Mamluk Sultan al-Salih Salih indicates that Yusuf had requested military help to fight the Christians; al-Salih prayed for Yusuf's victory but declined to send troops, saying they were needed for conflicts on his own borders. Many of Yusuf's diplomatic exchanges with the rulers of North Africa‚Äîespecially the Marinid sultans‚Äîare preserved in Rayhanat al-Kuttab compiled by Ibn al-Khatib. In the judiciary, the chief judge () Abu Abdullah Muhammad al-Ash'ari al- Malaqi, who was appointed by Muhammad IV continued to serve under Yusuf until his death at the battle of R√≠o Salado. He was known for his strong opinions; in one occasion, he wrote a poem to Yusuf warning him of officials who squandered tax revenues, and in another, he reminded the Sultan of his responsibilities to his subjects as a Muslim leader. After the death of al- Malaqi, Yusuf appointed, consecutively, Muhammad ibn Ayyash, Ibn Burtal, and Abu al-Qasim Muhammad al-Sabti. The latter resigned in 1347 and Yusuf then appointed Abu al-Barakat ibn al-Hajj al-Balafiqi, who had previously served as a judge in various provinces and was known for his love of literature. Yusuf strengthened the function of the muftis, distinguished jurists who issued legal opinions (s), often to assist judges in interpreting difficult points of Islamic law. The Madrasa Yusufiyya, where Maliki Islamic law was among the subjects taught, was created partly to increase the influence of the muftis. Yusuf's emphasis of the rule of law and his appointment of distinguished judges improved his standing among his subjects and among other Muslim monarchies. On the other hand, Yusuf had a mystical inclination that displeased the jurists () in his court, including his appreciation of the famous philosopher al-Ghazali (1058‚Äì1111), whose Sufi doctrines were disliked by the mainstream scholars.  Family  alt=A partial family tree of four generations According to Ibn al-Khatib, Yusuf began \\"playing with the idea of taking a concubine\\" after his accession. He had two concubines, both originally from the Christian lands, named Buthayna and Maryam or Rim. His union with Buthayna might have taken place in 737 AH ( CE), the date of a poem written by Ibn al-Jayyab about the wedding celebration. The wedding took place in a rainy day, and a horse race was held in its honour. In 1339 Buthayna gave birth to Yusuf's first son Muhammad (later Muhammad V), and subsequently to a daughter named Aisha. Maryam/Rim bore him seven children: two sons‚ÄîIsmail (later Ismail II, ), who was born nine months after Muhammad, and Qays‚Äîas well as five daughters‚ÄîFatima, Mu'mina, Khadija, Shams and Zaynab. The eldest daughter married her cousin, the future Muhammad VI (). Maryam/Rim's influence was said to be greater than that of Buthayna, and Yusuf favoured his second son Ismail above his other children. Yusuf had another son, Ahmad, whose mother is unknown. He also had a wife, who was the daughter of a Nasrid relative. Apart from their wedding in 738 AH ( CE), there is no reference to this wife in the historical sources, leading the historian B√°rbara Boloix Gallardo to speculate that she might have died early. Initially, Yusuf designated Ismail as his heir, but later‚Äîa few days before his death‚Äîhe named Muhammad instead. The education of the children was entrusted to Abu Nu'aym Ridwan, the who was a former Christian and managed to teach the young Ismail some Greek. Yusuf's grandmother Fatima, who had been influential in the Granadan court for multiple generations, died in 1349 aged 90 lunar years, and received an elegy from Ibn al-Khatib. The activity of Yusuf's mother Bahar was also attested: when the North African traveller Ibn Battuta visited Granada in 1350 and sought a royal audience, Yusuf was sick and in his place Bahar provided Ibn Battuta with enough money for his stay, even though it was unknown if Bahar actually met him or if he was received inside the Alhambra. Yusuf's concubine Maryam/Rim played an important role after his death: In 1359, she financed a coup that involved 100 men and deposed her stepson Muhammad V in favour of her son Ismail. Other than his predecessor Muhammad, Yusuf had another elder half-brother, Faraj, who moved overseas after Yusuf's succession. He later returned to the emirate, and was subsequently imprisoned and killed‚Äîprobably for political reasons‚Äîon Yusuf's order in Almer√≠a, 751 AH (1350 or 1351). Yusuf also imprisoned his younger half-brother, Ismail, who was later freed by Muhammad V and then settled in North Africa. Additionally, Yusuf had two half-sisters, Fatima and Maryam, whose marriages he arranged. One of them was married to Abu al-Hasan Ali, a distant member of the Nasrid family.  Death  alt=A round gold coin with a square pattern and Arabic calligraphy Yusuf was assassinated whilst praying in Granada's Great Mosque on 19 October 1354 (Eid al-Fitr/1 Shawwal 755 AH). A man stabbed him with a dagger during the last prostration of the Eid prayer ritual. Ibn al-Khatib was present‚Äîlikely praying a few metres from the Sultan, given that he was then a high court official‚Äîand his works include a detailed narration of the events. The attacker broke from the ranks of the congregation and went towards the Sultan. His movement was not noticed or did not alarm anyone because of his condition and rank, and upon reaching the Sultan, he leapt and stabbed him. The solemn prayer was then interrupted and Yusuf was carried to his royal apartment in the Alhambra, where he died. The assassin was interrogated, but his words were unintelligible. He was soon killed by a mob. His body was burnt (according to Ibn al-Khatib, though this statement might have referred to his supposed burning in hellfire) or \\"cut into a thousand pieces\\" (according to Ibn Khaldun). Ibn al-Khatib's account presents the murder as an act of a madman () without any motive, and this is also the main account presented by Fern√°ndez-Puertas and Harvey, although the latter adds that the lack of reported motive \\"fill[s] one with suspicion\\". Ibn Khaldun, as well as another Arab near-contemporary historian, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, concurred that the attacker was a madman of low rank and intelligence. Ibn Khaldun added that he was a slave in the royal stables whom some suspected to be a bastard son of Muhammad IV with a black woman. This led Vidal Castro to suggest an alternative explanation that it was a politically motivated attack instigated by a third party. Vidal Castro considers it unlikely that the attacker planned a political plot of his own, given his mental condition, or that the instigators aimed to have a demented bastard enthroned, given that Yusuf had his own sons as heirs. Instead, the historian suggests that the objective was simply to kill Yusuf and to end his rule, taking advantage of the attacker's unique condition. As Yusuf's supposed nephew, he would have an easier access to the Sultan, and with his mental condition he could be easily manipulated to conduct a likely suicidal attack without knowing its actual objective. In addition, it allowed the attack to be dismissed simply as a madman's action. Vidal Castro speculates that the real instigators could have been a faction at court whose identity and specific motives for killing Yusuf are unknown, or agents of the Marinid Sultan Abu Inan, whose relations with Yusuf soured towards the end of the latter's reign.  Legacy  Yusuf was succeeded by his eldest son, who became Muhammad V. Yusuf was buried in the royal cemetery () of the Alhambra, alongside his great-grandfather, Muhammad II, and his father, Ismail I. Centuries later, with the surrender of Granada, the last sultan, Muhammad XII (also known as Boabdil), exhumed the bodies in this cemetery and reburied them in Mond√∫jar, part of his Alpujarras estates. Fern√°ndez-Puertas describes the reigns of Yusuf and his successor Muhammad V as the \\"climax\\" of the Nasrid period, as seen from the realm's architectural and cultural output, and the flourishing of the study of medicine. Similarly, the historian Brian A. Catlos describes the reigns of these two sultans as the emirate's \\"era of greatest glory\\", and Rachel Ari√© describes the same period as its \\"apogee\\". L. P. Harvey describes Yusuf's cultural achievements as \\"considerable\\" and \\"solid\\", and as marking the beginning of the dynasty's \\"Golden Age\\". Furthermore, Yusuf's Granada survived the \\"onslaught of Alfonso XI's attacks\\" and at the end reduced its dependency on the Marinids. However, Harvey notes that he was defeated at R√≠o Salado, \\"the greatest single reverse suffered by the Muslim cause\\" during the Nasrid period before the fall of Granada, and presided over the strategically significant losses of Algeciras and Alcal√° de Benzaide.

It lives in burrows in shallow sandy parts of the sea-bed in the Mediterranean Sea and northern Atlantic Ocean. It is the most common thalassinidean in the Mediterranean, and has been used as bait by fishermen for at least 200 years. Description G. tyrrhenus is a small crustacean, up to long, with a soft exoskeleton apart from two large, unequal claws. It is whitish or greenish-grey, with pink or blue spots. Because of its burrowing lifestyle, G. tyrrhenus has small eyes on short stalks, and its maxillipeds can form an operculum; the telson is very short, and the rostrum is almost entirely absent. Larval development is rapid and involves few stages. Eggs hatch into a zoeal stage, which is followed by a second zoea and then a megalopa stage before adulthood. This rapid development allows the larvae to settle down into their adult habitat of relatively undisturbed muddy substrates, before they have travelled too far as planktonic larvae. Larval development is retarded by low salinities and aided by warmer temperatures, giving G. tyrrhenus a shorter reproductive season in the north of its range than in the south. Distribution and ecology G. tyrrhenus was first described from the Tyrrhenian Sea, and is found throughout the Mediterranean as well as in the Atlantic Ocean from Mauritania and the Canary Islands north to Ireland, in the Kattegat, and in the North Sea as far as southern Norway. Related species occur in the Black Sea, and G. tyrrhenus avoids water of low salinity, such as estuaries and the Baltic Sea. The burrows of G. tyrrhenus may be up to deep. They comprise a spiral central shaft up to 20 mm wide, with one or more shallow U‚Äìshaped shafts (up to wide) which lead to the surface of the sediment where they emerge as holes or funnel‚Äìshaped depressions. These shafts may be linked by further sections, and a number of side‚Äìchambers are found filled with seagrass. The overall volume of the burrow may reach . New tunnels are continually opened and old ones filled in. G. tyrrhenus feeds directly on the sediment, and receives nutrition from the debris collected in the debris chambers, as well as from the foraminiferans and algae which live on the walls of the burrow. The activity of G. tyrrhenus leads the walls of the burrow to be enriched with three times the ambient number of nematodes and more than 100 times the number of foraminiferans in the surrounding sediments.

The other band members were violinist R√∫aidhr√≠ Mannion, electric guitarist John Ferris, bassist Cavan Fyans and drummer Rob Baker. The band were frequently accompanied by saxophonist, Iain McDougall. The band name was conjured up by R√∫aidhr√≠ Mannion and allegedly came from an acronym of sorts although some mystery still surrounds its origin. catoan announced that the band had split in early 2008 due to \\"various circumstances\\". History =Formation= Paddy McKeown had been performing as a solo artist for a number of years in England and had a brief stint in NYC before returning to his native Belfast where he formed catoan. The band started out primarily as a backing band and Paddy continued to be promoted as a solo artist receiving great critical acclaim and even getting featured on the MySpace homepage for two weeks in August 2006. Then, in March 2007, the band announced the change to become catoan. McKeown has stated that he had never intended to be a solo artist and had been building a career as such due to not having found the right band dynamic. As soon as it became apparent that the members of the Paddy McKeown band were set to stick around, and because the unit functioned as a band anyway, the name change was a natural move. =Radio= catoan have done a number of sessions for various radio stations including BBC Radio Ulster's Across The Line, Dublin's Phantom FM and Cork's 96FM. catoan gained airplay on BBC Radio 1 in March and again in September 2007 bringing their new name to a much wider audience and helping secure them as one of the more prominent bands of Northern Ireland. The band continued to get airplay on NI stations such as U105fm, Radio Foyle and Radio Ulster. =Print media= The band both as Paddy McKeown (and band) and as catoan have received positive coverage both locally and nationally through magazines and papers such as AU Magazine, Hotpress, The Belfast Telegraph, The Big List and The Belfast Beat, as well as websites such as Culture Northern Ireland, Drowned In Sound and the BBC's Across The Line. =Best of Rising Irish Talent= After having been selected to perform on the Belfast leg of the IMRO showcase tour the band found their track, \\"Stranger\\" on an IMRO compilation CD entitled, The Best of Rising Irish Talent, which went out with the Irish Daily Star to its 500,000 readership across Ireland on 21 April 2007, helping them gain national recognition. =Performances= The band regularly perform around their native Belfast having played such venues as The Empire Music Hall, Laverys, The Pavilion, The Black Box, Auntie Annies, The Limelight and Spring and Airbrake. catoan embarked on their first national Irish tour in August 2007. Members of the band have done pared down acoustic performances as support for Jack L and Kate Nash. = The End = In May 2008, catoan announced that they had decided to split. Ruaidhri, Cavan and John announced the beginning of a new project, The Summer Experiment, in July 2008. The project ran for two years and featured collaborations with renowned photographer Graham Smith, Ponydance Contemporary Dance company, guitarist Ricky Graham and other celebrated artists from Northern Ireland. Violinist, Ruaidhri Mannion now lives and works in London where he is a composer and performer, completing a Doctor of Music degree at the Royal College of Music. Shortly after catoan disbanded Rob Baker vanished but has since been spotted several times on moose safari and another occasion dog sledging far above the arctic circle in Northern Norway.

Younger brother of Keith Narkle (by nine years) who also played for Swan Districts, Phil generally played on the wing position. Regarded as a highly skilled and determined footballer with tremendous pace, Phil was perfectly suited to the wing position where he could turn defence into attack. Playing career Phil Narkle played colts in 1977 for Swan Districts in the WANFL and was awarded the Medallists Medal for being the fairest and best player for that year. He made his debut for Swan Districts in the league competition during 1978 and gradually established himself for a club that was emerging from a lean period since Haydn Bunton junior had left fifteen years beforehand. Narkle had a sensational season in 1982 when he played in the WAFL premiership for Swan Districts, and during that year he also won the Sandover Medal for the best player in the WAFL. Narkle played one more year for Swan Districts playing in his second premiership for the club. The Grand Final was Narkle‚Äôs last game for Swans before moving onto St Kilda in the then-VFL. He was seen as an acquisition for the struggling Saints but a succession of injuries meant Narkle did not show anything of his best form at Moorabbin until the latter part of the 1986 season. In 1987 Narkle returned to Western Australia to play for the West Coast Eagles where he became the club‚Äôs inaugural selection to the All Australian Team.

In 1796 he took up the study of law, participated in the attempts to secure Mexico's independence from Spain, and, when that was finally achieved, opposed Agust√≠n de Iturbide's designs to transform the newborn republic into a hereditary monarchy. Repeatedly imprisoned and banished, he was nevertheless appointed to important positions in the Government. The Mexican-American War of 1846-48 was a source of deep grief to him. He founded the Mexican newspaper Diario de M√©xico in 1805 in which he expressed their independence liberal ideas and because this, he went to jail many times. After the C√°diz constitution he founded the newspaper \\"El Juguetillo\\". In 1813 Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n named him as editor in the independence newspaper Correo Americano del Sur. Carlos Mar√≠a de Bustamante become deputy for the Provincia de Mexico in the Congress of Chilpancingo where he wrote the inaugural speech for Morelos, which \\"declared that the insurgents were about to free Mexicans from the chains of serfdom imposed on them in 1521.\\"Brading, The First America, p. 636. Bustamante participated in the writing of first Mexican Constitution. He spend most of the time between 1815 and 1822 in jail. In 1822, after Mexican independence was achieved, Bustamente was elected deputy of Oaxaca. His historical sketch of The Mexican- American War is a sad record of the decay and disintegration which afflicted Mexico at the time. He writes with the greatest frankness, and unsparingly, about the conduct of the war on the Mexican side. His autobiography Lo que se dice, y lo que se hace, 1833, published in 1833, is also valuable as a fragment of contemporary history. Although constantly concerned in the politics of Mexico and occupying several very responsible positions during the most trying times of the Mexican Republic until the close of the war with the United States, Bustamante became a prominent Mexican historian. He distinguished himself by publishing historical works on colonial times, until then in manuscript and partly forgotten. Above all, his publication of Historia general de las cosas de Nueva Espa√±a, by Fray Bernardino de Sahag√∫n of the second half of the 16th century, was a service to historical research. In addition to the work of Sahag√∫n, Bustamante printed the chronicle of G√≥mara, the work of Veytia on Tezcuco, the dissertations of Gama on two large Mexican sculptures, and others. To the history by Sahag√∫n he added one of the relaciones of Fernando de Alva Ixtlixochitl, selected by him for the passionate spirit which it displays against the Spaniards. Bustamante found the manuscript of exiled Mexican Jesuit Andr√©s Cavo, Historia civil y pol√≠tica de M√©xico (Civil and Political History of Mexico), in Latin and Spanish. Bustamante published it with a large appendix, under the title Los tres siglos de M√©xico bajo el gobierno espa√±ol hasta la entrada del Ej√©cito Trigarante (Three Centuries of Mexico Under the Spanish Government until the entry of the Army of the Three Guarantees). The first edition was published in Mexico City in four volumes in 1836-1838. Bustamante also published a portion of Mariano Veytia's Historia antigua de M√©xico, which Veytia based on manuscripts collected by Lorenzo Boturini de Benaducci. J.

During World War II, it was used as a fortress by the British in the defence of Singapore. Many of these plantations were either abandoned or destroyed during the Japanese Occupation (1942‚Äì1945), which allowed such crops to grow wild. On 23 February 1954, the Governor of Singapore, Sir John Fearns Nicoll unveiled a plaque which declared the area had been renamed Kent Ridge to commemorate the visit by the Duchess of Kent and her son, the Duke of Kent, on 3 October 1952. The plaque was erected at the junction of what is now Kent Ridge Road and South Buona Vista Road.

The Malay Regiment's position on the hill was overrun by the Japanese and the battle ended in hand-to-hand combat after the last few defenders ran out of ammunition.

Together with Fort Siloso at Sentosa and The Battle Box at Fort Canning, they serve as a reminder of an important chapter in Singapore's modern history. Near to the top of the ridge, there is a commemorative heritage site marker which shows the area where the Battle of Pasir Panjang of 1942 was fought. The park also has some decommissioned Singapore Army military equipment, consisting of two WWII-vintage US M114 155mm field howitzers and a French AMX-13 light tank on permanent outdoor display until December 2015, donated by the Ministry of Defence as part of its adoption of Kent Ridge Park as The Army Green Park in support of the National Parks Board \\"Adopt-a-Park\\" scheme to inculcate a greater ownership among the public of local parks and greenery. The park's facilities include fitness corners, look-out points, a nature trail, a multi-purpose court and a canopy walk. The highest point of the park is 61 metres above sea level, from where there is a panoramic view of the coast of Pasir Panjang and some of the Southern Islands, approximately 5 km off the south-western coast of Singapore. Islands such as Pulau Bukom and Pulau Semakau are visible on a clear day. Kent Ridge park, Telok Blangah Hill Park, and Mount Faber Park are part of the Southern Ridges trail that links all 3 parks via connecting bridges and paths. Plant and animal life A section of the 280-metre long canopy walk in Kent Ridge Park The park is managed by the National Parks Board, and is open daily to the public. Admission is free except for entrance to the war museum. The park is accessible via entrances on Vigilante Drive and Pepys Road, off Pasir Panjang Road. Most of the remaining wild part of the park comprises secondary forest with plants native to Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia such as tembusu, angsana, white leaf fig, common pulai, Singapore rhododendron, pitcher plants, cicada tree and simpoh air.Thangamma (2006), \\"Flora of Kent Ridge Park\\", pp. 146‚Äì153. The trails through the park, including one for mountain biking, run almost parallel along the ridge. There is a natural pond with fishes and turtles in the north-west of the park. A 280-metre long canopy walk was completed in the eastern part of the park in October 2003, linking Kent Ridge Park to the war museum, Reflections at Bukit Chandu, enhancing the park's and museum's accessibility to the public. Along the walk, there are information boards providing educational information on the flora and fauna in the park. At the half-way point, there is a shelter for visitors to take a short break or to enjoy a scenic view of Normanton Park and the National Parks Board's plant nursery. It is one of four popular birdwatching sites on mainland Singapore along with Pasir Ris Park, Fort Canning Park and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. Birds found in the park include: white-crested laughing thrush, collared kingfisher, white-bellied sea eagle, banded woodpecker, pink- necked pigeon, blue-tailed bee-eater, white-breasted waterhen, and spotted dove.Thangamma (2006), \\"Birds at Kent Ridge Park\\", pp. 154‚Äì157.

As such, it was part of the greater movement for independence that swept India in the decades prior to the departure of the British in 1947.  Overview  Barisal was a district in the south-eastern corner of Bengal. The colonial police there reported that they had seized certain documents implicating the Anushilan Samiti, a revolutionary organization whose East Bengal chapters were under the leadership of Trailokyanath Chakravarty and Pratul Chandra Ganguli. The seized documents included a proposal to seduce native-born troops and to incite them to rebellion and wholesale massacre of the British. The trial of the 44 commenced in Calcutta in June 1913. The prosecutor for the Crown purported to show evidence of how the conspirators had divided up Bengal into several districts in order to preach sedition. The Samiti had specifically targeted students and unmarried youth by means of meetings and religious services, and their membership numbered hundreds in Barisal district alone. Judgment was passed in January 1914. Of the original 44 accused, 32 were discharged or pardoned, or had the cases against them withdrawn. The remaining 12 pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy against the British Crown. Five of the 12 - among them Pratul Chandra - were given lengthy transportation sentences to the Andamans of between 10 and 12 years. The remaining seven convicts were given transportation sentences between two and seven years. The case had further consequences. The Calcutta daily Amrita Bazar Patrika had published a series of articles commenting on the case. A show cause motion was brought against the editor Motilal Ghose and the publisher of the newspaper, charging them with contempt of court. However, the motion was later dismissed by a special branch of the High Court.

He resides in Har Nof where he is the rabbi of the local GR\\"A Synagogue, named after the Vilna Gaon of whom he is a direct descendant.  Biography Moishe Sternbuch was born on 15 February 1928 (24 Shevat) in London, one of 9 children of Osher Sternbuch, an Orthodox Jewish merchant, and Devorah. His parents hosted numerous rabbis who came to London to raise money for their yeshivas, among them Elchonon Wasserman, who after learning with Moishe declared that he was a davar sheyeish bo mamash (a boy of substance). He was tested in learning every Shabbat by Yechezkel Abramsky, who predicted he would one day become a moreh hora'ah (posek). Before long he was known as the Londoner Illui (prodigy). Osher died in 1939 at the age of 39, leaving behind his eldest child of 14 years, the 10-year-old Moishe, and the youngest only two. In 1940, Moishe entered the Toras Emes yeshiva in Stamford Hill, of which Moshe Schneider was the rosh yeshiva, where he would remain for ten years.Yated Ne'eman: 1 ; 2 He studied there with Bezalel Rakow, who was later to become the Gateshead Rov, Yitzchok Tuvia Weiss, his future colleague in the Edah HaChareidis, and future Olympia and York businessman Paul Reichmann. Sternbuch's family fled London during World War II due to The Blitz. They moved to a small nearby village where he shared a room with Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler, author of Michtav me-Eliyahu, who predicted that Sternbuch would someday be one of the gedolei hador (greatest of the generation). Due to the increasing threat of a Nazi invasion of Britain, Sternbuch's mother made attempts to arrange his safe passage to Canada or the United States. She asked Elyah Lopian, a rosh yeshiva from the East End of London, for advice on whether or not to allow her son to board what was to be the last passenger ship sailing for America till the war's end. Lopian offered to perform a goral haGra to divine the move's possibility for success , but as he was unable to accompany the solemn ceremony that day with the required fasting, the ship departed without Sternbuch, only to sink with 300 children aboard.  Rabbinic career Moishe Sternbuch After the war, Sternbuch decided to travel to the Land of Israel via France and Italy to study the Torah as taught in the Brisk yeshiva. He enrolled in the Hebron Yeshiva, simultaneously cultivating relationships with leading rabbis Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik (in 1952), Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz and Dov Berish Weidenfeld, all of whom he used to meet with regularly in their homes. Sternbuch subsequently took up a position in Johannesburg, South Africa. He was very involved in outreach, including his noted lectures to those in the medical field. He strongly opposes the Zionist State of Israel and was against its establishment. Holding a high position of authority in the anti-Zionist Edah HaChareidis, he is of the view that there is no connection between the existence of a Jewish state whatsoever and the beginning of the redemption of the Jewish People to the Land of Israel which will precede the Messianic Era.

Early life Born in East Hartford, Connecticut, the son of Archie and Adella (Ensign) Evans, he developed an interest in natural history, and insects in particular, as a child on his parents' tobacco farm. He attended the University of Connecticut, where he studied English. He took an interest in biology after attending classes in entomology by J.A. Manter. His thesis was based on rearing insects from branches broken by the1938 hurricane. He then joined for a Ph.D. at Cornell University but this was interrupted. Hearing of the attack on Pearl Harbor, he chose to serve in World War II, working as an army parasitologist, doing pioneering work on the Giardia parasite while stationed in St. John's, Newfoundland. He returned to North Carolina and worked at a base hospital studying parasites in the stools of returning servicemen. His studied at Cornell were then eased by the passing of the GI Bill. He worked on the systematics of the Pompilidae under J. Chester Bradley and V.S.L. Pate.

Since 2005, he has been a member of the Storting. He served as Minister of Agriculture and Food from 2018-2019, and as State Secretary at the Ministry of Transport and Communications from 2013-2015. From 1999 to 2002, he was the chairman of the Youth of the Progress Party. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from Telemark in 2005. He had previously served in the position of deputy representative during the terms 1997‚Äì2001 and 2001‚Äì2005. On the local level, Hoksrud was a member of Bamble Municipality council from 1991 to 2007. He does not have higher education, but worked as a grocery store manager before entering politics.  Early life and education  He was born 26 March 1973 in Porsgrunn to father, electrician Rolf Oddbj√∏rn Hoksrud (1944-) and mother Karin Gulbrandsen (1947-). Hoksrud finished Vallermyrene Upper Secondary school in 1992. He later managed a series of grocery stores up until 1998.  Political career  Active in the Progress Party's Youth (FPU) since 1989, he was the leader of its Telemark branch as well as central board member from 1996, before becoming its overall leader from 1999 to 2002. Hoksrud, who originally was third in line for the leadership, was elected after Robert Eriksson and Fredrik F√§rber declined the post.http://www.na24.no/article3722434.ece He was also employed as a political aide to the Progress Party parliamentary caucus, as well as serving as an organizational secretary for the party. Hoksrud started his career at age 18 as an elected politician as a member of Bamble municipal council from 1991 to 2011. Locally he was also a board member of Skiensfjordens Kommunale Kraftselskap from 1999 to 2000 and national board member of the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities from 2000 to 2005. He served as a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway during the terms 1997‚Äì2001 and 2001‚Äì2005, and was elected as a full member in the 2005 parliamentary election. During his first term he sat on the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, and after he was reelected in the 2009 parliamentary election he became the committees deputy leader. Hoksrud is one of Norway's most active members of parliament. According to the daily newspaper Aftenposten, Hoksrud was, along with fellow Progress Party politicians Ketil Solvik-Olsen and Torgeir Tr√¶ldal, the politicians who submitted most formal questions to the Cabinet ministers during parliamentary sessions. Hoksrud was again re-elected in 2013. When Solberg's Cabinet assumed office following that election, Hoksrud was appointed as a State Secretary in the Ministry of Transport and Communications under Ketil Solvik-Olsen. His parliamentary seat was taken by deputy Kristian Norheim. Views An outspoken opponent of Toll roads in Norway, Hoksrud frequently accused the Red-green coalition government of \\"highway robbery\\", when charging drivers in order to finance future road projects. While he supports a massive increase in road- and railway spending and construction, he believes this should be financed through the state budget. He once referred to the Minister of Transport Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa as a \\"modern day highwayman, due to her support for toll roads. He has been criticized for allegedly disregarding cases where the Progress Party itself votes in favour of toll roads on the municipal level. Generally opposed to taxes and restrictions on automobiles, Hoksrud accused prime minister Jens Stoltenberg of having a \\"hidden agenda\\" when the latter proposed a ban on diesel cars during specific days, in order to reduce pollution of CO2 and NOx gases, as well as extra taxation for diesel-run cars. This was because the government had advised people to buy diesel-run cars earlier before the health hazards were known. Hoksrud called the plans \\"hopeless\\" and polls made indicated that only 40% of drivers would respect the ban. The \\"Hoksrud affair\\" On 21 September 2011, media outlet TV 2 reported that Hoksrud had visited a brothel in Riga, the capital of Latvia. He subsequently admitted having paid a Latvian prostitute for services. As this is punishable under Norwegian law, the party's then deputy leader, Per Sandberg, said that Hoksrud would resign from his political positions, if the party so wishes. Hoksrud later confirmed this by saying : \\"I naturally wish that the party be at least possible harm for something extraordinarily stupid I did at my spare-time. I am now aware that the police is to open investigation, and therefore I immediately resign from all of my mandates in the party\\". As he was popularly elected, he was unable by law to resign from parliament. He did however resign from the party's powerful Central Committee, where he was replaced by P√•l Morten Borgli. In the end he received a fine of NOK 25.000 ($4800), which he accepted. In the aftermath of the case, Hoksrud experienced an outpouring of support on social media, and despite being declared politically dead by veteran political analyst Kyrre Nakkim, was unanimously nominated for reelection towards the 2013 elections. He was subsequently reelected for a third term.

Tulve belongs to the younger generation of Estonian composers who, in contrast to the neo-classicist tradition of rhythm-centeredness, create music which focuses on sound and sonority. Tulve‚Äôs works give a fair idea of the richness and variety of her cultural experience: the French school of spectral music, IRCAM‚Äôs experimentalism, Kaija Saariaho and Giacinto Scelsi, echoes of Gregorian chant and Eastern musics.

After a heat wave, which covered the entire Southern and Eastern Europe, the drought and southern wind helped spread the fires all over the Croatian coast, destroying a large part of the fragile plant and animal life. There were 750 fires on the coast from June 1 to August 8. They burned in the Istria County, the Zadar County, the ≈†ibenik-Knin County, the Split-Dalmatia County and the Dubrovnik-Neretva County. The total burned area covered 159,000 hectares. The police indicted 18 persons and arrested 12 persons for arson. Those arrested included an unnamed 56-year-old suspected of setting seven fires and some shepherds who burned grass for sheep. When fires broke out in the region of Dubrovnik, the local authorities accused the Bosnian town of Trebinje of deliberately setting fires.  Fires in Istria  Fire near Pula On July 19, a fire broke out near Pula. It caused the Pula-Premantura county road to be closed in the section from the Banjole crossroads to Premantura, reported the Croatian Automobile Club. On July 27, ten new fires broke out in the Istrian region. Two large fires - near the Pineta Trailer Park in Peroj near Pula and near the Amarin Trailer Park in Rovinj - were soon localized. On August 7, there was a fire between Batvaƒçi, Peroj and Barbariga, in the municipality of Vodnjan. It was localized around 7:30 PM by a Canadair CL-415 airplane and a helicopter that started extinguishing the fire around 6 PM. The fire, which was spreading because of the wind and the unapproachable terrain, was extinguished by 90 firefighters and 22 fire engines. The fire burned 80 hectares of forests and brush.  Fires in Dalmatia  There were several fires in Dalmatia in July and August. The first fire broke out in the afternoon of July 26, on Veliki Rujan, which is right next to the Paklenica National Park. The most endangered area was the southeast part of the National Park. The fire was fought by more than 200 firemen, National Park employees and members of the Croatian Ground Army. The firemen received reinforcements during the next days. There were also two firefighting planes and a helicopter. A fire broke out on the Svilaj Mountain, but it was soon localized. The fire near Podstra≈æje, a village by the Rukavac Cove on the island of Vis, was localized on August 7 by the professionals and volunteers from Vis and Komi≈æa, with 46 firemen and 9 fire engines. The August fire near Vrana Lake was soon localized. On August 8, a fire broke out around ≈Ωitniƒá, spreading to the mined area along the ≈†ibenik-Drni≈° state road, which was closed for traffic. It was fought by professionals and volunteers from Drni≈°: 21 firemen and 6 fire engines. = Kornati tragedy = Kornati in May 2003 On August 30, a new fire broke out on the island of Kornat, part of the Kornati National park. A team of 23 firemen was sent on an Mi-8 helicopter on what they thought would be just a routine mission. Upon arrival, they split into two teams, one with 6 firemen and the other with 17. The latter split up one more time when three firemen lost their communication gear and again when the fourth one went checking for the signal, while trying to call his superiors. The remaining 13 were stranded between two hills with no water whatsoever, since the large water canister landed 500 meters away from them. While searching for it, they got encircled by a wall of fire. Although the burning grass was only 10 cm tall, the firemen did not have the necessary equipment and had nowhere to run. In only a minute, six of them were killed instantly, while the other seven remained lying on the ground, badly burned, waiting for help more than two hours. After the rescue, they were sent to the hospital in Zadar and then transferred to hospitals in Zagreb and Split. Six of them died in hospital because of serious burns covering large areas of their bodies. The fire itself had nowhere to spread, and was soon naturally extinguished, bringing up many questions about the necessity of the intervention. Allegedly, the firemen were killed by an unexploded CBU-87 dumped over Kornat island by NATO planes returning from the Kosovo war in 1999.  Fires around Dubrovnik  On August 5, several fires broke out in the Dubrovnik-Neretva County. At 10 PM, the sirens sounded the general alarm because the fire came close to the city of Dubrovnik itself. The mayor Dubravka ≈†uica called all the able men to help the firemen. A shelter for women, children and old people was made in the Revelin Fortress. The firemen from the Split-Dalmatia County and the ≈†ibenik- Knin County helped fight the fire. At one time, the fire crossed ≈Ωarkovica, a couple of hundred meters from the first city houses. On the other side, the fire reached Komolac and endangered the main power station. The state road was closed in the section from Konavle to Zaton, so the drivers there had to spend the night waiting on the road. The most desperate situation was around Moko≈°ica, where the 20-kilometer fire came down to the houses, burning one house in ≈†umet. On August 8, a forest fire broke out in the municipality of Konavle. It was fought by the county firemen and the state intervention forces of Dubrovnik, with 50 firemen and 15 fire engines. They were helped by three Canadair CL-415 airplanes and an Air Tractor. Firefighting was made more difficult by the strong wind and drought. Some tourists were evacuated from local hotels. The fires near Dubrovnik were well-publicized by international media.  International accusations of arson  On August 6 and August 7, the Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader visited Dubrovnik, which was followed by fires in that area. It prompted some county officials to make arson accusations against the nearby town of Trebinje in the neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mario Magud, the firefighting commander in Konavle, said: \\"There are no firemen on the Trebinje side. Everything indicates that they set the fire themselves with the intention to burn Konavle and beyond. It's not a coincidence that, as soon as we localize one fire, a new fire breaks out.\\" Luka Korda, the chief of Konavle municipality, made similar accusations. The Bosnian civil defense secretary Stanko Sli≈°koviƒá said it was not true that the Bosnian firemen did not do anything to prevent fires in the border area near Dubrovnik: \\"Our people made the greatest effort to fight every fire where it was possible. Nobody can say with certainty where a fire started... I'm sorry this happened and I understand the indignation of the citizens of Dubrovnik, but it's not our fault.\\" He claimed that the Bosnian civil defense cooperated well with their Croatian counterparts and said that the Bosnian forces could not fight the fires in the inaccessible or mined areas.

Other members of the band included three future members of the E Street Band - Vini Lopez, Danny Federici and Steve Van Zandt. As well as playing on the Jersey Shore, Steel Mill also played regularly in Richmond, Virginia and played gigs in California and a festival in Nashville, Tennessee. They opened for acts such as Chicago, Boz Scaggs, Grand Funk Railroad, Roy Orbison, Ike & Tina Turner and Black Sabbath. Since 2004 Vini Lopez has led Steel Mill Retro which has performed and recorded original Springsteen songs from the Steel Mill era. History =Early bands= Three of the band's founding members, Bruce Springsteen, Vini Lopez and Vinnie Roslin met for the first time on April 22, 1966 at a battle of the bands competition at the Matawan-Keyport Roller Drome in Matawan, New Jersey. Roslin was one of the judges while Springsteen and Lopez competed in the competition with their respective bands, The Castiles and Sonny & The Starfires. Backstreets #30 Fall 1989 However, before coming together to form Steel Mill, both Springsteen and Lopez went on to play in other bands. Springsteen formed Earth with fellow Ocean County College students, John Graham (bass) and Michael Burke (drums). They would later be joined by another former Castile, Bob Alfano (organ). Lopez, meanwhile, played with the Downtown Tangiers Band, which also included Bill Chinnock, Danny Federici and Garry Tallent, and then in Moment of Truth with Tallent, Federici and Ricky DeSarno (guitars). =Child= In 1968 The Upstage Club was opened at 702 Cookman Avenue in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The club would subsequently play a central role in the history of both Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band and Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes. On February 14, 1969, Lopez, looking to recruit a guitarist for a new band, saw Springsteen play with Earth at the Italian American Mens Association Clubhouse in Long Branch, New Jersey. Then on February 21, Lopez, Springsteen, Federici and Roslin got together at the Upstage and formed a new band called Child. Shortly afterwards Carl \\"Tinker\\" West, a surfboard designer and concert promoter who originally came from California, became the band's manager. From March 1969 on, Child played regularly at the Pandemonium in Wanamassa, New Jersey. On May 28 they opened for James Cotton at this venue. Child also played there on July 20, 1969, the night of the Apollo 11 first manned moon landing. The club installed several TV monitors especially for the occasion. During the show the audience stopped watching the band and turned their attention to Neil Armstrong. As a result, the band fell out with the club management and never played there again. On November 1, 1969, the band played their last show using the name Child at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. Shortly afterwards they discovered that another band from Long Island, New York was also using the name and had just released an album under that name on Roulette Records. Roslin has stated that they were actually mistaken for the other Child during shows in Richmond, Virginia.Charles R. Cross: Backstreets - Springsteen: The Man And His Music (1989)Backstreets #19 Winter 1987 =Steel Mill= To avoid confusion with the other Child, the band changed their name to Steel Mill, a name suggested by Chuck Dillon, a friend of Lopez. On November 21, 1969 at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia, the band opened for Chicago and the following night they opened for Iron Butterfly at the same venue. In early 1970 Steel Mill visited San Francisco and performed at The Matrix and Fillmore West, and played on the same bill as Elvin Bishop, Boz Scaggs and Grin. On February 22, they also recorded three songs - \\"Goin‚Äô Back To Georgia\\", \\"The Train Song\\" and \\"He‚Äôs Guilty (Send That Boy To Jail)\\" - at the Pacific Recording Studio in San Mateo, California for Bill Graham. Graham had just formed Fillmore Records and actually offered Steel Mill a contract. However the band rejected it. Shortly after returning from San Francisco, Roslin left Steel Mill. He played his last gig with the band at Virginia Commonwealth University on February 28, 1970. He was subsequently replaced by Steve Van Zandt. Roslin was let go by the band due to disagreement over rehearsal time and effort put in. On their return from California, Steel Mill continued to play regularly on the Jersey Shore and in Richmond, Virginia. On June 13, 1970 they opened for Grand Funk Railroad at the Ocean Ice Palace in Bricktown, New Jersey. On June 21 they played at the Clearwater Swim Club in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey when their opening act was Glory Road, a band whose line up included Garry Tallent and Bill Chinnock. In August the band added Robbin Thompson as lead vocalist. Thompson had been the lead singer with Mercy Flight, a Richmond-based band that had regularly opened for Steel Mill. He made his debut with Steel Mill on August 29 at the 3rd Annual Nashville Music Festival, sponsored by WMAC. Steel Mill was one of about twenty different acts to take part. Headliners included Roy Orbison, Brian Hyland, Ronnie Milsap, Bobby Bloom, Ballin' Jack, Ten Wheel Drive and The Illusion. Steel Mill was one of only a handful of acts on the bill without a record contract - some college students with connections on the festival‚Äôs organizing committee had seen Steel Mill perform previously in Richmond and helped the band gain a slot on the bill. On September 11 they played another show at the Clearwater Swim Club which entered into Steel Mill folklore. Among the opening acts was a local folk singer, Jeannie Clark, whose backing band consisted of Steve Van Zandt, Garry Tallent and Southside Johnny. Steel Mill's lineup for this show included guest drummer Dave Hazlett of Mercy Flight. Lopez had earlier been detained in Richmond after getting caught up in a police raid. In order to raise money for their drummer, Steel Mill kept playing, breaking a curfew. Police officers came to the stage to end the gig, after cutting the power, which had not worked. Protests were heard and Danny Federici allegedly dropped some sound equipment on the police in front of the stage, then managed to disappear into the crowd as riots broke out between the crowd and the police. Federici escaped arrest and earned the nickname \\"Phantom\\", which would stay with him. On October 11 they opened for Ike & Tina Turner at The Mosque in Richmond. On November 27 they played on a triple bill with Cactus and Black Sabbath at the Sunshine Inn in Asbury Park. On Thanksgiving, Nov. 25, 1970, they played on a bill with The Institution at Newark State College (now Kean University). The Institution was a seminal New Jersey garage band founded in 1965 by Philip Rubin, J. Howard Duff , Richard Lester, and Marvin Coopersmith, whose members also included Joey Kramer, later of Aerosmith. Steel Mill played their final show on January 23, 1971 at The Upstage. However, during the early 1970s Springsteen, Lopez, Federici and Van Zandt would go on to play together in several short-lived bands based out of the Upstage. These included Bruce Springsteen & The Friendly Enemies, The Sundance Blues Band, Dr. Zoom & The Sonic Boom (Once opened for the Allman Brothers at the Sunshine Inn in Asbury Park) and The Bruce Springsteen Band (which often played at the Student Prince in Asbury Park). These bands would eventually evolve into the E Street Band. =Steel Mill Retro= Since 2004 Vini Lopez has led Steel Mill Retro, a band which has played and recorded Bruce Springsteen songs from the Steel Mill era. Lopez was a veteran of numerous Jersey Shore bands, several of which had featured Steel Mill songs in their set lists. In 1989 Lopez was playing with Live Bait, a band led by singer/songwriter Laura Crisci. As well as playing original Crisci songs, this band also included two early Springsteen songs in its setlist, \\"Goin' Back To Georgia\\" and \\"Cowboys of the Sea\\" which had been performed by The Bruce Springsteen Band. Its setlists included an original song written by Steve Clark, \\"Whatever Happened to Asbury Park?\\" Lopez also took lead vocals on both songs.Backstreets #29 Summer 1989 During the 1990s Lopez led his own bar band, Maddog & The Disco Rejects. Members of the band included John Luraschi (bass) and Ricky DeSarno (guitars). This band also performed early Springsteen songs in its setlist.Backstreets #47 Fall 1994 By 2002 Lopez was playing with Cold Blast and Steel which also included John Luraschi and Rick DeSarno. This band would eventually develop into Steel Mill Retro which would also feature Ricky DeSarno. In 2007 they released \\"The Dead Sea Chronicles\\", an album that featured Steel Mill era songs. In September 2008 Steel Mill Retro also played at a Springsteen fan convention in Rotterdam, organised by the Dutch fan club Roulette. They were accompanied to the convention by Carl \\"Tinker\\" West, the original manager of Steel Mill. The current line-up of the band features Lopez, Steve Lusardi and Adam Glenn (keyboards), Ed Piersanti (bass) and John Galella (guitar). Discography Steel Mill never released any official recordings. However both Robbin Thompson and Vini Lopez, as part of Steel Mill Retro, have both recorded songs originally performed by the band. *Robbin Thompson  \\"He‚Äôs Guilty (Send That Boy To Jail)\\" : Recorded as \\"Guilty\\" for the 1985 album Better Late Than Never.

Hagen to Siv Jensen, Wara was before the 2009 election spoken of as a possible Minister of Finance for the party in an eventual government, with the recent broad popular support for the party. In 2018, he was appointed Minister of Justice by Erna Solberg. Harassment campaign In November 2018, a photo of Wara's private residence was used on stage for political commentary in the play Ways of Seeing, a production of the Black Box theatre in Oslo. Wara's long-term live-in partner Laila Anita Bertheussen along with Prime Minister Erna Solberg sharply criticized the production for exposing the Wara household in this manner, and in December 2018, Bertheussen filed a formal complaint against the theatre. Over the following months, the family received threatening letters and their house was vandalized with graffiti, before the apparent harassment culminated on March 10, 2019 with an arson attack on their car. However, four days later, Bertheussen was arrested on suspicion of having staged the entire harassment campaign herself, prompting Wara to resign his position on March 28. The trial is due to conclude on November 13, 2020. Accused of endangering democracy, Bertheussen potentially faces up to 16 years in prison.

He led and worked with other renowned freedom fighters and led to freedom of India. He lived for 80 years, out of which he spent 30 years in jail. Some of his years in jail was after Indian independence in Bangladesh, which was under Pakistan control, after partisan of Hindustan into India and Pakistan. He was born in 1889 at Kapasiatia district Mymensingh in present-day Bangladesh. He joined in freedom struggle as a boy of 7 years old while in school in 1906 and became a leader of the Dhaka Anushilan Samiti. He was first arrested for his revolutionary activities in 1908, as a result of that he could not finish his education. However, he could speak 3-4 of Indian languages apart from English. Many of these languages he learnt in jail from his jail mates. He was one of the chief accused in the Barisal Conspiracy Case of 1913, and was sentenced by the British and transported to the Andamans as a result. After independence in 1947, he became a politician and parliamentary member. He died in 1970 in Delhi, India. In spite of being freedom fighter and spending much of his life in hiding, he had strong influence in family of his brothers, education of grand kids, their marriage decisions. He inspired many girl grandchildren to get higher degrees in education. He never married. Early life Chakravarty joined the revolutionary organization Anushilan Samiti in 1906 while in school. He was arrested for revolutionary activity in 1908, and consequently could not complete his schooling. In 1912, he was arrested for a murder but later released due to lack of evidence. He was arrested again, in Calcutta in 1914, due to his underground revolutionary activities carried out in Rajshahi, Comilla and Malda and was sent to Andaman for the Barisal Conspiracy Case. Role in freedom struggle Trailokyanath came back to Calcutta on the expiry of his sentence. There he took the charge of the National School. He was arrested once more in 1927 and was sent to a prison at Mandalaya in Burma. He was released in 1928 when he joined the Hindustan Republican Army. He participated in the Lahore Congress in 1929. He was in jail again from 1930 to 1938. After his release, Trailokyanath joined the Ramgarh Congress. He made a futile attempt to stir rebellion in the British Indian army during the Second World War. He participated in the quit India movement and was imprisoned in 1942. However, he was released from jail in 1946. He now devoted himself to organisational activities in Noakhali. After independence After the partition of India in 1947, Chakravarty joined politics in East Pakistan. He founded the Pakistan Socialist Party. He was elected member of the Provincial Assembly in 1954 as a nominee of the United Front. After promulgation of martial law in the country in 1958, an embargo was imposed on his political and social activities. He passed the final years of his life in self-exile at his village home. He wrote two memoirs on contemporary politics entitled Jele Trish Bachhar, Pak-Bharater Swadhinata Sangram. His other contribution is Geetai Swaraj. = Death = Chakravarty had been suffering from a dilated heart and traveled to Calcutta for treatment in 1970. From there, he was carried to Delhi and was accorded a national reception. He died at 3:30 a.m. (IST) on 9 August that year at the residence of his former associate Surendra Mohan Ghose. His remains were cremated the following day in Calcutta at the Keoratola crematorium. The last rites were performed by his nephew. A two- minute silence was observed in Lok Sabha, the lower House of the Indian Parliament, following Chakravarty's death as a mark of respect.

They were dug out from the solid limestone by the British during the Great Siege of Gibraltar of the late 18th century. History The Great Siege of Gibraltar was an attempt by France and Spain to capture Gibraltar from Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War. Lasting from July 1779 to February 1783, it was the fourteenth and final siege of Gibraltar. During the siege, British and Spanish forces faced each other across an approximately wide stretch of the marshy open ground that forms the isthmus immediately to the north of the Rock of Gibraltar. The British lines blocked access to the City and the western side of the Rock, while the eastern side of the Rock was inaccessible because of its steep terrain. Gun batteries were placed in a series of galleries on the north face of the Rock, providing overlapping fields of fire so that infantry attacks would come under heavy fire throughout their advance. The impetus for the construction of the tunnels came from the garrison's need to cover a blind angle on the north-east side of the Rock. The only solution found to cover that angle was via a gun mounted on a spur of rock known as The Notch. There was no possibility of building a path there due to the vertical cliff face, so Sergeant-Major Henry Ince of the Military Artificers suggested digging a tunnel to reach it. His plan was approved and construction work began on 25 May 1782. Construction and design View of The Notch as seen from Devil's Tower Road The work was carried out by hand, mainly using sledgehammers and crowbars, aided by gunpowder blasts. The work proceeded slowly at first; it took thirteen men five weeks to dig a tunnel with a length of . The diggers were hindered by fumes and dust from the frequent blasting, so it was decided to blast a horizontal shaft to improve the tunnels' ventilation. This was done and was found to have had an unexpected side benefit. Colonel John Drinkwater Bethune, who wrote an account of the siege in 1785, described how this came about: Work progressed fairly rapidly thereafter, though it did not entirely go to plan, with several false starts in direction in the latter part of 1782. One tunnel drive was determined to be too far from the outer face of the Rock and another too close to it. A consistent direction was eventually found, and by the end of the fourth siege embrasures had been blasted overlooking the Spanish lines. Total construction length of the tunnels by the end of 1783 was approximately . When excavations reached The Notch in the summer of 1783 it was decided that instead of pursuing the original idea of mounting a single gun on top of it, The Notch would be hollowed out into a broad chamber that the diggers named St. George's Hall and that was later equipped with seven guns. By the end of the initial phase of tunnelling, five galleries had been excavated: Windsor Gallery, King's And Queen's Lines, St. George's Hall, and Cornwallis Chamber. The Windsor Gallery was the first part of the tunnel system, and four guns were mounted there. St. George's Hall is the largest of the original galleries. The embrasures can be seen on the slopes of the Rock when approaching Gibraltar from land and sea. Originally the embrasures were fitted with mantlets or curtains of woven ropes; the rails on which they were supported can still be seen. These protected the guns and gunners from enemy fire and prevented sparks and smoke blowing back into the embrasures. As an additional safety measure, each cannon was isolated with a wet cloth hanging above it from a rope, to prevent the sparks from igniting the remaining gunpowder.Great Siege Tunnels Gibraltar Travel Guide Later history of the tunnels George Augustus Eliott, a Koehler Depressing Carriage and the crest of the Royal Engineers at the entrance to the tunnels. General George Augustus Eliott had offered a reward to anyone who would invent a method to get cannons to the other side of the Rock. Although it is unknown whether Sergeant Major Ince ever got this reward, he received a plot of land on the Upper Rock, which is still called Ince's Farm. He was later given a valuable horse. Ince's troops, who were known at the time as Soldier Artificers, founded the Soldier Artificer Company in Gibraltar in 1772, which later became the Corps of Royal Engineers. During the 19th century the original cannon were replaced with more modern 64-pounder rifled muzzle loaders on iron carriages, some of which can still be seen in the tunnels.\\"History of the Tunnels\\". Great Siege Tunnels, Gibraltar. Although Ince's galleries remained little changed, the work that he started was hugely expanded in the years after the siege and new tunnels were built to connect to the first galleries. By 1790 around of tunnels had been constructed inside the Rock.Chartrand, p. 24 The Second World War led to another great wave of tunnelling as work was undertaken to enable the Rock to house a garrison of 16,000 men with water, food, ammunition and fuel supplies sufficient to last a year under siege.Finlayson, p. 47 The Great Siege Tunnels were reused during the war; although it is uncertain exactly how they were used, it appears that they may have housed one of the generators used to power Gibraltar's searchlights, as a concrete mounting pad of the requisite dimensions was installed in one of the embrasures. The Great Siege Tunnels were extended in two directions during the war, with a long straight extension called the Holyland Tunnel continuing through to the east side of the Rock, so named because it points in the direction of Jerusalem; and a staircase dug to link the tunnels with other Second World War tunnels lower down, known as the Middle Galleries. However, the methods by which the Second World War tunnels were hastily excavated have meant that ‚Äì unlike the original 18th century tunnels ‚Äì they have crumbled rapidly and now can not be safely accessed.\\"The Tunnels in World War II\\".

Image is rotating to more clearly show the saddle-like shape of the vapor‚Äìliquid equilibria The UNIFAC method (UNIQUAC Functional-group Activity Coefficients)Aage Fredenslund, Russell L. Jones and John M. Prausnitz, \\"Group-Contribution Estimation of Activity Coefficients in Nonideal Liquid Mixtures\\", AIChE Journal, vol. 21 (1975), p. 1086 is a semi-empirical system for the prediction of non- electrolyte activity in non-ideal mixtures. UNIFAC uses the functional groups present on the molecules that make up the liquid mixture to calculate activity coefficients. By using interactions for each of the functional groups present on the molecules, as well as some binary interaction coefficients, the activity of each of the solutions can be calculated. This information can be used to obtain information on liquid equilibria, which is useful in many thermodynamic calculations, such as chemical reactor design, and distillation calculations. The UNIFAC model was first published in 1975 by Fredenslund, Jones and Prausnitz, a group of chemical engineering researchers from the University of California. Subsequently they and other authors have published a wide range of UNIFAC papers, extending the capabilities of the model; this has been by the development of new or revision of existing UNIFAC model parameters. UNIFAC is an attempt by these researchers to provide a flexible liquid equilibria model for wider use in chemistry, the chemical and process engineering disciplines.  Introduction  A particular problem in the area of liquid-state thermodynamics is the sourcing of reliable thermodynamic constants. These constants are necessary for the successful prediction of the free energy state of the system; without this information it is impossible to model the equilibrium phases of the system. Obtaining this free energy data is not a trivial problem, and requires careful experiments, such as calorimetry, to successfully measure the energy of the system. Even when this work is performed it is infeasible to attempt to conduct this work for every single possible class of chemicals, and the binary, or higher, mixtures thereof. To alleviate this problem, free energy prediction models, such as UNIFAC, are employed to predict the system's energy based on a few previously measured constants. It is possible to calculate some of these parameters using ab initio methods like COSMO-RS, but results should be treated with caution, because ab initio predictions can be off. Similarly, UNIFAC can be off, and for both methods it is advisable to validate the energies obtained from these calculations experimentally.  UNIFAC correlation  The UNIFAC correlation attempts to break down the problem of predicting interactions between molecules by describing molecular interactions based upon the functional groups attached to the molecule. This is done in order to reduce the sheer number of binary interactions that would be needed to be measured to predict the state of the system. = Chemical activity = The activity coefficient of the components in a system is a correction factor that accounts for deviations of real systems from that of an Ideal solution, which can either be measured via experiment or estimated from chemical models (such as UNIFAC). By adding a correction factor, known as the activity (a_i, the activity of the ith component) to the liquid phase fraction of a liquid mixture, some of the effects of the real solution can be accounted for. The activity of a real chemical is a function of the thermodynamic state of the system, i.e. temperature and pressure. Equipped with the activity coefficients and a knowledge of the constituents and their relative amounts, phenomena such as phase separation and vapour-liquid equilibria can be calculated. UNIFAC attempts to be a general model for the successful prediction of activity coefficients. = Model parameters = The UNIFAC model splits up the activity coefficient for each species in the system into two components; a combinatorial gamma^c and a residual component gamma^r. For the i-th molecule, the activity coefficients are broken down as per the following equation: : ln gamma_i = ln gamma_i^c + ln gamma_i^r. In the UNIFAC model, there are three main parameters required to determine the activity for each molecule in the system. Firstly there are the group surface area Q and volume contributions R obtained from the Van der Waals surface area and volumes. These parameters depend purely upon the individual functional groups on the host molecules. Finally there is the binary interaction parameter tau_{ij}, which is related to the interaction energy U_i of molecular pairs (equation in \\"residual\\" section). These parameters must be obtained either through experiments, via data fitting or molecular simulation.  Combinatorial  The combinatorial component of the activity is contributed to by several terms in its equation (below), and is the same as for the UNIQUAC model. : ln gamma_i^c = ln frac{phi_i}{x_i} + frac{z}{2} q_i lnfrac{theta_i}{phi_i} + L_i - frac{phi_i}{x_i} displaystylesum_{j=1}^{n} x_j L_j, where theta_i and phi_i are the molar weighted segment and area fractional components for the i-th molecule in the total system and are defined by the following equation; L_i is a compound parameter of r, z and q. z is the coordination number of the system, but the model is found to be relatively insensitive to its value and is frequently quoted as a constant having the value of 10. : theta_i = frac{x_i q_i}{displaystylesum_{j=1}^{n} x_j q_j}, quad phi_i = frac{x_i r_i}{displaystylesum_{j=1}^{n} x_j r_j}, quad L_i = frac{z}{2}(r_i - q_i)-(r_i-1), quad z=10, q_i and r_i are calculated from the group surface area and volume contributions Q and R (Usually obtained via tabulated values) as well as the number of occurrences of the functional group on each molecule u_k such that: : r_i = displaystylesum_{k=1}^{n} u_k R_k, quad q_i = displaystylesum_{k=1}^{n} u_k Q_k.  Residual  The residual component of the activity gamma^{r} is due to interactions between groups present in the system, with the original paper referring to the concept of a \\"solution-of-groups\\". The residual component of the activity for the i-th molecule containing n unique functional groups can be written as follows: : ln gamma_i^r = displaystylesum_{k}^n u_k^{(i)} left[ ln Gamma_k - ln Gamma_k^{(i)} right], where Gamma_k^{(i)} is the activity of an isolated group in a solution consisting only of molecules of type i. The formulation of the residual activity ensures that the condition for the limiting case of a single molecule in a pure component solution, the activity is equal to 1; as by the definition of Gamma_k^{(i)}, one finds that ln Gamma_k - ln Gamma_k^{(i)} will be zero. The following formula is used for both Gamma_k and Gamma_k^{(i)} : ln Gamma_k = Q_k left[1 - ln displaystylesum_m Theta_m Psi_{mk} - displaystylesum_m frac{Theta_m Psi_{km}}{displaystylesum_n Theta_n Psi_{nm}}right]. In this formula Theta_m is the summation of the area fraction of group m, over all the different groups and is somewhat similar in form, but not the same as theta_i. Psi_{mn} is the group interaction parameter and is a measure of the interaction energy between groups. This is calculated using an Arrhenius equation (albeit with a pseudo-constant of value 1). X_n is the group mole fraction, which is the number of groups n in the solution divided by the total number of groups. : Theta_m = frac{Q_m X_m}{displaystylesum_{n} Q_n X_n}, : Psi_{mn} = exp left[ -frac{U_{mn} - U_{nm} }{RT} right], quad X_m = frac{ displaystylesum_j u^j_m x_j}{displaystylesum_j displaystylesum_n u_n^j x_j}, U_{mn} is the energy of interaction between groups m and n, with SI units of joules per mole and R is the ideal gas constant. Note that it is not the case that U_{mn} = U_{nm}, giving rise to a non-reflexive parameter. The equation for the group interaction parameter can be simplified to the following: : Psi_{mn} = expfrac{-a_{mn}}{T}. Thus a_{mn} still represents the net energy of interaction between groups m and n, but has the somewhat unusual units of absolute temperature (SI kelvins). These interaction energy values are obtained from experimental data, and are usually tabulated.

Born after World War II, he is a part of \\"La Jeune Peinture\\" de l'Ecole de Paris (\\"The Young Painting\\" of the School of Paris ). Schuss came to France in 1949, and he has benefited from a Franco- Austrian cultural upbringing. His family dates its history back to the 12th century in the Cani della Scala family di Verona, Italy, and the Von Prack von Asch Family from Tyrol, Austria.  Biography  Since his early childhood, as soon as he learned to hold a pencil and a brush, he started to draw and paint with passion. After different homes in Burgundy, Provence and the C√¥te d'Azur near Saint Tropez, his family setting up in Ni√®vre in 1953. At the age of 10, Schuss met the French painter Albert Drachkovitch-Thomas, who discovered his talent. He offered him his first professional paintings box and brushes and he introduced him succinctly to the tempera technique. But it is a self-taught artist that Paul Schuss learned others pictural techniques like acrylic, watercolor, inkwashing, mixmedia and pastel. He exhibited for the first time at the age of 17 in the Chapelle Sainte Marie (Nevers, France) with Le Salon du Groupe Nivernais. He created these paintings at the age of 14, 15 and 16. All these paintings were bought by collectors. The Prefecture de Nevers bought the painting that he showed in his next exhibition in May in Nevers. He began to study law in Paris but eventually decided to devote himself entirely to art at the age of nineteen. As an adolescent, he discovers the mystical power of Light. He saw a warm, strange golden light ‚Äì as if it was inhabited ‚Äì glowing through the window of a fortified castle in ruins. This stream of light touched him deeply as he felt it was the Life of Light. Since then, this image has been part of him and has influenced his art in many ways. As he was living in Paris, he met Ert√© in 1968. In 1971 he left for Austria in search of his roots. He lived for two years in Salzburg and then for six years in Vienna. In 1972 he showed his art in the Palais Lobkowitz in Vienna, where Ludwig van Beethoven's Third Symphony was performed for the first time in Vienna in this hall with the composer as conductor in 1804. He met the Doctor Karl Kanzian who will become the most important collector of Paul Schuss' paintings in Europe. In 1974 Prinz Otto zu Windisch-Graetz (born in 1928 and related to the family of Emperor Franz Josef von Habsburg-Lothringen and Elisabeth of Bavarian (Sissi) and their son Prinz Rudolf of Austria) and several relatives visited him in his studio in Vienna. Prinz Otto zu Windisch-Graetz shot photos of his important tempera paintings like \\"Dialog with the Eternal\\", \\"Power of Nature\\", \\"The Town without Soul\\", \\"Last Suns\\". In 1979 Paul Schuss returned to France and resides since this time in Burgundy. Since 1980, he is part of one of the most important galleries of Paris: La Galerie d'Art de la Place Beauvau. The director, Jean Minet, said about Paul Schuss: \\" He is one of our eminent painters, yes he is an eminent artist\\". In Paris in 1987 he met Marc Squarciafichi who became his manager in Japan. With artists like Bernard Buffet, Leonor Fini, Mac Avoy, Yves Brayer and others he belongs to the School of Paris ( Ecole de Paris) that Marc Squarciafichi exhibited for more than 15 years in the biggest cities of Japan, in important galleries like Daimaru Galleries, Bijutsu Sekai Gallery, Mori Art Gallery, Nikken Gallery. Schuss has used a great variety of techniques ranging from tempera to acrylic, watercolor, pastel, mixed techniques, drawing, tint, and lithography. In 1987 he learned lithography at the world-famous Atelier Mourlot in Paris, where artists like Salvador Dal√≠, Norman Rockwell, Matisse, Arno Breker or Picasso made their lithos in the past. He makes a point of destroying officially the plates used for his lithographs and sells each lithograph with an authenticity certificate signed by Jacques Mourlot. He made 11 editions until 1990: 5 editions in color and 6 in black and white (monochrome). Paul Schuss wanted to create black and white lithographs at that time. Jacques Mourlot told him that no artists were making monochrome lithographs anymore and that only color ones were being produced. In 1989, Paul Schuss was the first artist to create black and white lithographs again in France. This latter became as famous as his color lithographs in Japan. His works includes \\" The refuge Tree\\", \\"Untamed Passions\\", both in 1989, followed by \\" Waiting\\", \\" The old bridge\\", \\" The crows\\" and \\" The forgotten letter\\", in 1990. Since 1987, Doctor Sozo Hino, owner of the Hino Hospital and great collector begun to collect the art of Paul Schuss to create a Schuss Museum in Osaka, in Japan. The project failed in 1991, after the French government restarted the nuclear tests in the Pacific. At this time all French items were boycotted. Schuss has exhibited his work at an international level, in France, Austria, Germany, Japan, England, Monaco, and in the United States (Hawaii) and New York. His work is found in public and private collections around the world. Paul Schuss currently lives in Burgundy, France. He is married to Chantal Garceau and they have two children: Tatiana and Romain. His sister Elisabeth is married to the writer Tidiane Diakite. His passion for discovering new landscapes and new cultures leads him to travel around the world.

It is distinguished from other major mathematical competitions such as Putnam by its strong focus on research, originality, teamwork, communication and justification of results. It runs concurrently with the Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM).  Problems  At the beginning of the contest, teams have a choice between two problems. Problem A involves a system that requires the use of continuous mathematics, and thus often involves concepts from geometry, physics, or engineering. Problem B involves a system that requires the use of discrete mathematics. In 2016, a \\"data insights\\" problem was added, where teams are given access to database files and tasked with using them to answer a question.https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/flyer/MCM-Problem-C- Overview.pdf This problem was designated as Problem C, though previously, Problem C referred to an ICM problem. These problems tend to be open-ended, and are drawn from all fields of science, business, and public policy. Past problems include * Estimate the global effects of a large asteroid impacting Antarctica (1999 A) * Study the hunting strategies of velociraptor dinosaurs based on fossil data (1997 A) * Develop a more efficient method of boarding passengers onto large commercial jets (2007 B) Teams have 96 hours to research and submit their solutions in the form of a research paper. During this time, they may consult any available references, but may not discuss their problem with anyone outside their teams. Several guides containing advice and recommendations for teams and/or advisors have been published online or in print.http://amath.colorado.edu/uploads/event_docs/mcm_guide.pdf Published in MAA FOCUS vol 26 #6, August/September 2006, pp.22-23  Participation and awards  Thousands of international teams of three undergraduates compete to produce original mathematical papers in response to one of two modeling problems. Initially, participation was largely from the United States, however in recent years international participation has grown significantly, particularly from the People's Republic of China, so that in 2007 teams from the United States comprised only 24% of total participation.

History  The school was designed by James Stewart Johnston in the mid-1930s, but building work was delayed until after World War II and construction started in 1949. The building was originally to be called Pilton Intermediate School. The first headmaster was Norman Murchison who was also a well known commentator on post-war education having delivered the 14th Charles Russell memorial lecture on the subject of 'Some social aspects of modern education' in 1968. He was also involved in numerous other debates including one on the propensity for young Scots to go abroad after the war and the delinquency level of children in early 1950. He also had the honour of becoming the first Citizen Of The Year for the City of Edinburgh. A lecture theatre was named in his honour at the University of Edinburgh's Kings Buildings campus. He retired in June 1968 and was succeeded by Norman Chalmers. The school colours were red and gold and the badge was a golden dolphin on a red background. From its opening in 1948 until 1965 it was a junior secondary school meaning pupils left at the end of their third academic year. If they wished to sit O-level examinations they had to move on to another school. The 1965/66 academic year saw the school attain senior secondary status thereby allowing pupils to remain into fourth year to sit O-level exams. The school subsequently expanded the academic syllabus to offer Higher examinations. The opening of Craigroyston Community High School and the falling birth rate since the late 1960s meant that Ainslie Park was no longer viable as a secondary school, and the building became the North Campus for Edinburgh's Telford College. The axe finally fell on Ainslie Park in 1991. A full planning application to develop the site was submitted by Miller Homes on 21 March 2007. This was granted by the City of Edinburgh Council. The main building was the original building designed by J.S. Johnston in the 1930s' Art Deco style and was listed under category B. The main building was to be converted into flats while the rest is to be new build, but Miller Homes seems to have successfully appealed under test d: The repair of the building is not economically viable and is currently demolishing the old main building. =1971 tragedy= On 21‚Äì22 November 1971 five members of a mountaineering club at Ainslie Park School and an 18-year-old trainee instructor from Newcastle-under-Lyme died in a blizzard while trying to walk from Cairn Gorm to Corrour Bothy.Aircrew Association: Cairngorm Disaster 1971 A party of 14 children led by 23-year-old Ben Beattie, who was Ainslie Park's outdoor instructor, and his 21-year-old girlfriend Catherine Davidson, set out for Lagganlia to be met by a local instructor called Sheila Sutherland. The party then split into two with Beattie taking one group and Davidson and Sutherland taking the other.

Born in Bennettsbridge, County Kilkenny, Moran first played competitive hurling during his schooling at St. Kieran's College. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team. He made his senior debut during the 1961 championship. Moran subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won four All-Ireland medals, five Leinster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions Moran won three Railway Cup medals. At club level he is an eight- time championship medallist with Bennettsbridge. Throughout his career Moran made 26 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1972 championship. Playing career =Club= Moran was still eligible for the minor grade when he made his senior debut with the Bennettsbridge senior team in 1956. He was at right wing-back as the Bridge faced John Lockes in the championship decider. John Lockes had a goal disallowed by an umpire, a factor which contributed to a 2-8 to 3-3 victory for Bennettsbridge. It was Moran's first championship medal. After failing to retain their title, Bennettsbridge qualified for the county decider again in 1959. A 4-6 to 1-4 defeat of Erin's Own gave Moran a second championship medal. Bennettsbridge retained the championship in 1960, with Moran adding a third winners' medal to his collection following a narrow 4-5 to 3-4 defeat of Glenmore. Three-in-a-row proved beyond the Bridge, however, Moran lined out in a fourth county final in 1962. Lisdowney, who had recently earned promotion from the junior grade, provided the opposition. Goals were key as Bennettsbridge claimed a 5-7 to 2-8 victory. It was Moran's fourth championship medal. After surrendering their championship crown the following year, Bennettsbridge bounced back to contest the decider again in 1964. On a day when five Treacy brothers lined out for the Bridge, they recorded a 4-9 to 1-4 victory over Glenmore. It was Moran's fifth championship medal. Mooncoin ended hopes of retaining the title in 1965, as Moran suffered his first defeat in a county final, however, both sides renewed their rivalry in the 1966 decider. A double scores 4-8 to 2-4 victory avenged the previous year's defeat and gave Moran a sixth championship medal. Bennettsbridge continued to dominate club hurling once again in 1967. A 3-10 to 1-4 defeat of Thomastown earned a seventh championship medal for Moran. A period of decline followed following defeat by Rower-Inistioge in the 1968 decider, however, Bennettsbridge returned to the summit of club hurling again in 1971. A 3-10 to 1-7 defeat of reigning champions Fenians gave Moran his eighth and final championship medal. Moran continued t line out with Bennettsbridge for the next few years, however, his side were defeated by Fenians in the finals of 1972 and 1974. =Minor= Moran was sixteen year-old when he was called up to the Kilkenny minor team in 1956. He won a Leinster medal that year following a 4‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì7 defeat of Wexford in the provincial decider. On 23 September 1956 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. A 4‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì5 trouncing, with teen sensation Jimmy Doyle contributing 2-3, resulted in defeat for Moran and his side. The following year Moran added a second Leinster medal to his collection, as Offaly were defeated by 5‚Äì10 to 4‚Äì2. For the second year in-a- row, Tipperary provided the opposition in the All-Ireland final on 1 September 1957. In a close game Tipperary eventually triumphed by 4‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì7. =Senior= Early success Moran made his senior championship debut on 18 June 1961 in a 6-8 to 5-7 Leinster semi-final defeat by Wexford. After two years without success, Moran won his first Leinster medal following a 2‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì9 defeat of Dublin. This victory allowed Kilkenny to advance directly into an All-Ireland showdown with Waterford on 1 September 1963. \\"The Cats\\" entered the game as underdogs, however, Eddie Keher proved to be the difference with a magnificent display in which he scored fourteen points. Despite a hat-trick of goals from Waterford's S√©amus Power, Kilkenny secured a 4‚Äì17 to 6‚Äì8 victory. It was Moran's first All-Ireland medal. All-Ireland defeats Moran added a second Leinster medal to his collection in 1964 as Dublin were defeated on a 4‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì8 score line. The All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964 saw Kilkenny enter the game as firm favourites against fierce rivals Tipperary. John \\"Mackey\\" McKenna scored Tipperary's first goal after ten minutes as the Munster champions took a 1‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì6 interval lead. The second half saw Tipperary score goals for fun, with Donie Nealon getting a hat-trick and Se√°n McLoughlin another. Kilkenny were humiliated at the full-time whistle as Tipperary triumphed by 5‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì8. In spite of this defeat Moran's performances throughout the year earned him a C√∫ Chulainn Award. After surrendering their provincial crown in 1965, Kilkenny bounced back the following year by reaching the final of the National Hurling League. An aggregate 10‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì15 defeat of New York gave Moran a league medal. He later won a third Leinster medal following a 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 4 September 1966 pitted Kilkenny against Cork for the first time in nineteen years. Kilkenny were the favourites, however, a hat-trick of goals by Colm Sheehan gave Cork a merited 3‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì10 victory. There was some consolation before the end of the year, with Moran winning an Oireachtas medal following a 4-7 to 1-7 victory over Wexford. Kilkenny resurgence Moran collected a fourth Leinster medal in 1967 as Kilkenny retained their provincial crown following a 4‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì12 defeat of Wexford after a scare in the opening half. On 3 September 1967 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. Tipperary looked like continuing their hoodoo over their near rivals as they took a 2‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì3 lead at half-time. Goalkeeper Ollie Walsh was the hero for Kilkenny as he made a series of spectacular saves, however, the team lost Eddie Keher and Tom Walsh to injury in the second half. In spite of this, Kilkenny laid to rest a bogey that Tipperary had over the team since 1922, and a 3‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì7 victory gave Carroll a second All-Ireland medal. He finished off the year by claiming a second Oireachtas medal following a 4-4 to 1-8 defeat of Clare and a second C√∫ Chulainn Award. Wexford put an end to Kilkenny's hopes of retaining the title in 1968, however, the Noresiders bounced back the following year with Moran collecting a fifth Leinster medal following a 3‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì16 defeat of Offaly. On 7 September 1969 Kilkenny took on Cork in the All-Ireland decider, however, Moran was dropped from the starting fifteen. The Leesiders got into their stride following an early goal by Charlie McCarthy and led by six points coming up to half time when Kilkenny raised a green flag themselves. Kilkenny upped their performance after the interval and ran out winners on a 2‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì9 scoreline. The victory gave Moran, who came on as a substitute, a third All-Ireland medal. Cork and Kilkenny renewed their rivalry before the end of the year, however, a 4-14 to 3-10 victory gave Moran a third Oireachtas medal. Twilight success After surrendering their provincial and All-Ireland crowns to Wexford the following year, Moran remained dropped from the starting fifteen in 1971. He was a non-playing substitute as Kilkenny defeated Wexford by 6-16 to 3-16 to take the Leinster title once again. On 5 September 1971 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final, however, Moran still remained on the bench. He was eventually introduced as a substitute, however, Tipperary emerged the victors on a score line of 5‚Äì17 to 5‚Äì14. Moran played an increasingly peripheral role during 1972 and, after being introduced as a substitute in the drawn provincial final, he remained on the bench for the reply which Kilkenny won by defeating Wexford. Cork provided the opposition in the All-Ireland final on 3 September 1972, a game which is often considered to be one of the classic games of the modern era. Halfway through the second-half Cork were on form and stretched their lead to eight points. Kilkenny's great scoring threat, Eddie Keher, was deployed closer to goal and finished the game with 2‚Äì9. A fifteen-point swing resulted in Kilkenny winning the game by 3‚Äì24 to 5‚Äì11. Moran, who started the game on the bench but was introduced as a substitute, won his fourth All-Ireland medal before bringing the curtain down on his inter-county career.

It was written in Hungary by Andromeda Software and distributed in the UK by Ariolasoft. The storyline features an astronaut and his dog who explore an Egyptian tomb (as revealed in the opening sequence) and need to find the Pharaoh's Jewel by solving puzzles spread over three levels. The game is played in 1st person view. A sequel was said to be in development in 1986 but was never released.https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/gtw64/scarabaeus-2/ Gameplay The three levels are linked by an elevator, and each is a maze of different size. The first level sees the astronaut trying to catch nine ghosts, each of which yields up a tablet with a hieroglyph on it (e.g., a snake, a bird, a hand); these hieroglyphs are needed on the next level. Exiting the level (which can be done at any time, not just after the ninth hieroglyph is taken) takes the astronaut to an elevator. This is operated by a crank, and the player needs to rotate the joystick through all directions in order to move the elevator down to the next level. If the player misses a direction during the rotation, then the elevator plummets down to the next level with significant loss of energy. The player may also proceed directly to the third level without completing, or even visiting, the second level. The second level has a bigger maze with 13 alcoves. Walking past an alcove will cause a spider to come out and follow the astronaut's route, although at a slower pace than him. While the alcove is vacant, the astronaut is able to look inside the alcove. The aim is thus to take the spider on a long journey around the maze, giving the astronaut enough time to study the alcove and solve the puzzles within. 12 of the 13 alcoves contain two puzzles, one on the left and one on the right. The left-hand ones are made by a 4x5 grid of hieroglyphs like the ones collected on the previous level, linked to a bottle of potion, who can be medicine or poison. By carefully studying the grid, it is necessary to see if the nine hieroglyphs collected on the first level appear (in any order) in a 3x3 block within the 4x5 grid. If it's so, it means the bottle contains medicine, otherwise it contains poison. The player can activate it to mark it down as medicine but its true nature can only be found by trying it on the third level. The right- hand puzzles are identicals and can be solved in the same way, but they are linked to a mask instead. If the nine hieroglyphs fit in those grids, taking the mask will give the player a zombie trap, otherwise a loss of energy will occur. The thirteenth alcove contains a tile-flipping puzzle. Initially some tiles are turned over while others not, and it is necessary to turn them all face up. Buttons around the tiles allow the player to flip rows, columns or diagonals, but not individual tiles. Success with this puzzle leads to the award of the Pharaoh's key which allows the astronaut to walk through walls on the third level. Medicines, zombie traps and the Pharaon's key can be used on the next level where the player must use the correct medicines in order to open clues to the puzzle in the center of the level containing the Jewel (medicine bottles believed to be correct from level 2 are on the bottom of the map). Walking into an alcove releases a zombie which must be trapped with the zombie traps. (indicated by masks at the bottom of the map) After all the medicine is taken, the player can then solve the puzzle in the middle of the map. The clues indicate where the hieroglyphs are to be lined up. The player must line them up in conjunction with the clues given in a limited number of moves otherwise the puzzle will lock and he will have to try again on another part. Successful completion opens the puzzle to access the inner sanctum where the Sacred jewel Scarabaeus lies winning the game. At the end of the game the player's score is tallied. Reception Scarabaeus was awarded an overall mark of 96% in issue 8 of Zzap!64 magazine, earning it a Sizzler award.

It is a single gene disorder but it is complex in its mechanics. Symptoms *In affected children studied, the first signs of Pretzel syndrome begin during gestation: 80% of mothers have polyhydramnios, extra amniotic fluid around the affected baby. *The majority of mothers also have preterm labor starting anywhere from 25‚Äì38 weeks gestation. The brain is large and malformed in all affected children. *MRI studies show extra fluid around the brain, or ‚Äúhydrocephalus.‚Äù *The nerve cells are not positioned properly and probably do not make normal connections with other nerve cells. As a result, seizures begin early in life and are often difficult to treat. *Mental development is severely delayed. *The muscles are thin and weaker than normal. The combination of low muscle tone and abnormal connective tissue results in very flexible joints and allows children to twist themselves into unusual ‚Äúpretzel- like‚Äù postures. *Like other muscles of the body, those that control the eyes are also weak, and about 40% of affected children have strabismus or ‚Äúlazy eye.‚Äù *Approximately one third of the affected children have anatomical heart defects. The most common is atrial septal defect--a hole between the two upper chambers of the heart. This defect typically does not cause symptoms of heart failure early in life, but can become problematic later in childhood. *In 20-30% of affected children, there is a buildup of calcium deposits in the kidneys, which then lose the ability to conserve water for the body. This condition, called diabetes insipidus, causes children to urinate frequently. Genetics The defective gene is called LYK5. It has a complicated function that is only partly understood. The LYK5 gene product is part of a chemical ‚Äúrelay‚Äù or ‚Äúmessaging‚Äù system that controls the growth and function of many cells in the body. In Pretzel syndrome, part of the LYK5 gene is missing, which leads to a complete loss of this signaling function.Clinic For Special Children Newsletter clinicforspecialchildren.org The LYK5 gene has an important role in normal organ development. Defective organ development that begins during the earliest stages of pregnancy is not treatable and leads to a variety of medical problems throughout life. Diagnosis Treatment Although the organ defects caused by LYK5 deficiency can not be prevented or reversed, Pretzel syndrome can nonetheless be treated by recognizing problems such as seizures, strabismus, diabetes insipidus, and heart defects, and treating these problems appropriately to optimize the health and well-being of the child. *Children with strabismus should be treated by a pediatric eye doctor to prevent permanent loss of vision. *Children with diabetes insipidus should be allowed to drink freely to prevent severe dehydration.

Social workers work with a variety of groups in all settings in which social work is practiced. While some have proposed that social work practice with groups reflects any and all groups within which social workers participate, other definitional parameters have been established (Garvin et al., 2004). Middleman and Wood (1990) have proposed that for practice to qualify as social work with groups four conditions must be met: the worker should focus attention on helping the group members become a system of mutual aid; the group worker must understand the role of the group process itself as the primary force responsible for individual and collective change; the group worker seeks to enhance group autonomy; the group worker helps the group members experience their groupness upon termination (Middleman & Wood, 1990). Middleman and Wood (1990) observe that social group worksocial group work meets their criteria of social work with groups. They also point out that \\"given our definition of work with groups, therapy can be the content and can be included also, contingent upon the way in which the group as a whole and groupness are used\\" in accord with the identified criteria (p. 11). As long as the criteria is met, structured group work \\"where the worker is the expert until his knowledge has been imparted to the group\\" could be regarded as social work with groups as well (Middleman & Wood, 1990, p. 11‚Äì12). The group as the unit of social work practice A common conceptualization of the small group drawn from the social work literature is as > \\"a social system consisting of two or more persons who stand in status and > role relationships with one another and possessing a set of norms or values > which regulate the attitudes and behaviors of the individual members in > matters of consequence to the group. A group is a statement of relationship > among person. Therefore, social systems have structure and some degree of > stability, interaction, reciprocity, interdependence and group bond. Open > social systems do not exist in a vacuum; they are part of and transact with‚Ä¶ > their surroundings‚Ä¶.\\" (Klein, 1972, pp.125-126). For Schwartz (1971), the group was most simply, \\"a collection of people who need each other in order to work on certain common tasks, in an agency hospitable to those tasks\\" (p. 7)  Evolution of social group work in the United States  = Pre-1930s = Social group work and group psychotherapy have primarily developed along parallel paths. Where the roots of contemporary group psychotherapy are often traced to the group education classes of tuberculosis patients conducted by Joseph Pratt in 1906, the exact birth of social group work can not be easily identified (Kaiser, 1958; Schleidlinger, 2000; Wilson, 1976). Social group work approaches are rooted in the group activities of various social agencies that arose in the latter part of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century. Social upheaval and new found demands as a result of post Civil War industrialization, migration and immigration created many individual and societal needs (Brown, 1991; Kaiser, 1958; Middleman, 1968; Reid, 1991; Schwartz, 1977; Wilson, 1976). Some of these needs were met through group work endeavors found in settlement housessettlement houses as well as religious and charity organizations (Middleman, 1968; Wilson, 1976). Additionally group work could be found in the progressive education movement (Dewey, 1910), the play and recreation movement (Boyd, 1935), informal education, camping and youth service organizations invested in 'character building' (Alissi, 1980; Schwartz, 1977; Williamson, 1929; Wilson, 1976). As Clara Kaiser (1958) has indicated there have been numerous philosophical and theoretical influences on the development of social group work. Chief amongst these influences are the ethics of Judeo-Christian religions; the settlement house movement's charitable and humanitarian efforts; theories eminent in progressive education, especially those of John Dewey (1910); sociological theories about the nature of the relationship between man and society, i.e. Mead (1934); the democratic ethic articulated by early social philosophers; the psychoanalytic theories of Rank and Freud; the practice wisdom, theory building, educational and research efforts of early social group workers (Alissi, 1980; Kaiser, 1958; Wilson, 1976). Early theoretical, research and practice efforts of Grace Coyle (1930, 1935, 1937, 1947, 1948), Wilber Newstetter (1935), and Neva Boyd (1935) paved the way for the advancement and development of social group work. In the summer of 1934 Grace Coyle organized a two-week group work institute for forty YWCA and settlement house workers at Fletcher Farm, Vermont. Grace Coyle presented an early theoretical framework for social group work articulating the need for a democratic value base (Coyle, 1935), identifying the role of the worker as a group builder (Coyle, 1937) and noting the benefits of 'esprit de corps' or group morale (Coyle, 1930). As the editor of several small group research compendiums Hare (1976) would later point out, \\"many of her insights about group process were ahead of her time\\" (p. 388). =The mid-thirties to the 1950s= Social group work was introduced to the social work profession when it made its debut at the National Conference for Social Work in 1935. At this conference, Newsletter (1935) introduced the concept of social group work to the social work profession and identified group work as a field, process and set of techniques. He described group work as an \\"educational process\\" concerned with \\"the development and social adjustment of an individual through voluntary group association\\" and \\"the use of this association as a means of furthering other socially desirable ends\\" (p. 291). The period of time between the 1930s and the 1950s was one of growth and expansion for social group work (Alissi, 1980; Wilson, 1976). The economic despair of and varied psychosocial needs resultant of the Great Depression paved the way for greater affiliation between the social work profession and the field of group work (Alissi, 1980; Konopka, 1983; Wilson, 1976). The psychological needs of returning war veterans who served in World War II resulted in the more frequent application of social group work in psychiatric treatment (Konopka, 1983). During this period of time not only would the field of social group work debut at the National Conference for Social Work but additional advances would be made. Academic courses and research institutions were established; a professional organization was formed, The American Association of Social Work with Groups (AAGW); and a journal, The Group, was established. The first textbooks would appear as well, written by Harleigh Trecker (1948) and Gertrude Wilson and Gladys Ryland (1949). The 1950s would usher in even greater affiliation of group work with the profession of social work (Alissi, 1980; Andrews, 2001). The merger of the AAGW with six other organizations to form the National Association of Social Work (NASW) in 1955 solidified the identification and integration of social group work with the social work profession (Alissi, 1980; Andrews, 2001). The impact of the merger was reflected in efforts at definitional shifts regarding group work. In 1956 the NASW formed a group work section which issued a new definition that contrasted in focus with that proposed by the AAGW. The new definition dismissed the idea of group work with normal growth and development and instead saw group work as a > \\"service to a group where the primary purpose is to help members improve > social adjustment, and the secondary purpose is to help the group achieve > objectives approved by society‚Ä¶the definition assumes that the members have > adjustment problems\\" (Alissi, 1980, p. 24). Less than one fifth of the group work section agreed with this definition at the time (Alissi, 1980). The ensuing tensions regarding the defining parameters of social group work lead to a reconceptualization that included recognition that there existed different models to be used for different purposes (Hartford, 1964; Papell & Rothman, 1966). = The 1960s to the present = The 1960s and the 1970s saw the expansion of the social welfare state; the Vietnam War; the emergence of the war on poverty; the Woman's Rights Movement; the Black Power Movement; and the Lesbian and Gay Rights Movement (Balgopal & Vassil, 1983; Somers, 1976). The above social, intellectual and cultural factors influenced the social work profession including social group work (Balgopal & Vassil, 1983; Somers, 1976). With such a wide range of social and therapeutic needs there seemed to be an even greater appreciation of group work (Balgopal & Vassil, 1983; Hartford, 1964; Somers, 1976). Having expanded into differing practice settings, the purposes and goals of group work had been more broadly described at this juncture than in previous decades. Group work scholars made great strides in developing practice theories. The work of Vinter and Schwartz and their respective associates would dominate the group work scene for much of this decade and the next (Galinsky & Schopler, 1974). In Vinter's approach (1967) the treatment group is thought of as a small social system \\"whose influences can be planfully guided to modify client behavior\\" (p. 4). In this approach the worker takes a central position in providing treatment, interventions are planned, group process is highly structured, and great emphasis is given to outcome evaluation and research (Vinter, 1967; Garvin, 1987; Galinsky & Schopler, 1974). Schwartz (1961) proposed his vision of the small group as an enterprise in mutual aid. In 1965 Bernstein and colleagues introduced another social group work practice theory (Bernstein, 1978; Lowy, 1978; Garland, Kolodney & Jones, 1978). The centerpiece of the edited collection was a developmental stage model, known as the Boston Model, which presented a framework for understanding how groups navigate degrees of emotional closeness over time (Bernstein, 1978; Garland, Kolodney & Jones, 1978). In 1966 Papell and Rothman (1966) presented a typology of social group work that included the social goals model (in the tradition of Coyle), the remedial model (as developed by Vinter) and the reciprocal model (as articulated by Schwartz). In 1968 Middleman (1968) made a seminal contribution in articulating an approach to group work practice that utilized non-verbal activities. In 1976 Roberts and presented a collection of ten group work practice theories (Roberts & , 1976) further illustrating the diversity of approaches to group practice. As theory building proliferated there was a simultaneous effort to distill the essential elements of social group work. In 1980 Papell and Rothman wrote, > \\"The process of distilling and identifying the central identity of group > work in the contemporary period has already begun\\" (p.7. In adopting the phrase, the Mainstream Model of Social Work with Groups, Papell and Rothman conferred their agreement with Lang (1979) that there existed a \\"mainstream of social work practice with groups\\" (p. 209). Papell and Rothman suggested the essential characteristics of the mainstream model were \\"common goals, mutual aid, and non-synthetic experiences\\" (1980, p. 7). The late seventies saw the reemergence of a professional journal, Social Work with Groups in 1978. Additionally, in 1978 social group workers formed a committee to host a symposium in honor of Grace Coyle which paved the way for an annual conference in subsequent years ( & Kurland, 2001). The conference planning committee was transformed into the membership driven organization, The Association for the Advancement of Social Work with Groups now an international organization (AASWG, 2006). Contemporary group work practice continues to be informed by the work of early pioneers and the vanguards of the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to the Mutual Aid Model of social work with groups, the Cognitive-Behavioral Group Work Model is recognized as influential on contemporary group work practice (Rose, 2004). The approach suggested by Rose (1989, 2004) integrates cognitive and behavioral interventions with small group strategies. While primacy is not placed on establishing the group as a mutual aid system in quite the same way as with the Mutual Aid Model, Rose (2004) suggests the worker promote group discussion and member interaction. Furthermore, drawing upon Yalom's Therapeutic Factor construct Rose (2004) points out the benefits of universality, altruism, and group cohesion as well as mutual reinforcement, factors which are conceptually resonant with mutual aid. Purpose In 1964 the Committee on Practice of the Group Work Section of the National Association of Social Workers proposed that group work was applicable for the following purposes: corrective/treatment; prevention; normal social growth and development; personal enhancement; and citizenship indoctrination (Hartford, 1964). Common needs addressed by social work groups include coping with major life transitions; the need to acquire information or skills; the need to improve social relationships; and the need to cope with illness; and the need to cope with feelings of loss or loneliness; amongst other reasons (Gitterman & Shulman, 2005; & Kurland, 2001). Guiding values and Kurland (2001) identify the value system informing group work practice with \\"the ultimate value of social work\\" which they suggest is \\"that human beings have opportunities to realize their potential for living in ways that are both personally satisfying and socially desirable\\" (p. 15). Humanistic values guide social work practice with groups, inform worker role and use of self, and the understanding of membership in a social work group. Humanistic values \\"cast people in society as responsible for and to one another\\" (Glassman & Kates, 1990, p. 13). The perspective espoused by several social work group work experts is that not only are people responsible for one another but that mutual interdependence is preferable to individualism (Falck, 1989; Getzel, 1978; Glassman & Kates, 1990; & Kurland, 2001; Schwartz, 1961; Shulman, 2006; Steinberg, 2004). The following humanistic values have been highlighted by social work educators, such as Gisela Konopka, as integral to social work practice with groups: 1) \\"individuals are of inherent worth\\"; 2) \\"people are mutually responsible for each other; and 3) \\"people have the fundamental right to experience mental health brought about by social and political conditions that support their fulfillment\\" (Glassman & Kates, 1990, p. 14). Democratic norms of group participation which flow from humanistic values are actively shaped by group workers as they promote cooperation and \\"fluid distribution of position, power and resources\\" (Glassman & Kates, 1990, p. 14).  Primary rationale for group services in social work  Opportunities for mutual aid to be found in the group encounter offer the major rationale for the provision of group services by social workers. Gitterman (2006), a social work educator and group work scholar has elaborated on the role of mutual aid in the small group noting that \\"as members become involved with one another, they develop helping relationships and become invested in each other and in participating in the group\\" (p. 93). The mutual aid processes that unfold help group members \\"to experience their concerns and life issues as universal,\\" to \\"reduce isolation and stigma,\\" to \\"offer and receive help from each other,\\" and to \\"learn from each other's views, suggestions and challenges\\" (Gitterman, 2006, p. 93). Not only do group services offer opportunities for social support as Toseland and Siporin (1986) explain \\"there is also an important helper therapy principle that operates in groups\\" (p. 172). Toseland and Siporin (1986) elaborate: \\"clients are able to help others and in so doing receive help for themselves\\" (p. 172). Mutual aid Mutual aid as group work technology can be understood as an exchange of help wherein the group member is both the provider as well as the recipient of help in service of achieving common group and individual goals (Borkman, 1999; Gitterman, 2006; Lieberman, 1983; & Kurland, 2001; Schwartz, 1961; Shulman, 2006, Steinberg, 2004; Toseland & Siporin, 1986). The rationale for cultivating mutual aid in the group encounter is premised on mutual aid's resonance with humanistic values and the following propositions: 1) members have strengths, opinions, perspectives, information, and experiences that can be drawn upon to help others in the group; 2) helping others helps the helper, a concept known as the helper-therapy principle (Reissman, 1965) which has been empirically validated (Roberts et al., 1999); and 3) some types of help, such as confrontation, are better received when emanating from a peer rather than the worker (Shulman, 2006). Mutual aid is often erroneously understood as simply the exchange of support. Mutual aid is better conceptualized as multidimensional with at least 10 types of processes or activities that occur amongst and between members, including: sharing data, the dialectic process, discussion of taboo topics, the all in the same boat phenomenon, developing a universal perspective, mutual support, mutual demand (including confrontation), rehearsal of new skills, individual problem solving, and the strengths in numbers phenomenon (Gitterman, 2004; Shulman, 2006; Steinberg, 2004). Practice models =The mutual aid model= The Mutual Aid Model of group work practice (Gitterman, 2004) has its roots in the practice theory proposed by William Schwartz (1961) which was introduced in the article, \\"The Social Worker in the Group\\". Schwartz (1961) envisioned the group as an > \\"enterprise in mutual aid, an alliance of individuals who need each other in > varying degrees, to work on certain common problems\\" (p.266). Schwartz elaborated: > \\"the fact is that this is a helping system in which clients need each other > as well as the worker. This need to use each other, to create not one but > many helping relationships, is a vital ingredient of the group process and > constitutes a need over and above the specific tasks for which the group was > formed\\" (1961, p. 266). While referred to as social group work (Papell & Rothman,1966), Schwartz preferred to think of this model as social work with groups (Schwartz, 1976). Schwartz (1976) regarded this approach as resonant with the demands of a variety of group types including, natural and formed; therapeutic and task; open and closed; and voluntary and mandatory. Schwartz (1961, 1964) initially thought of this approach as an organic systems model (as he viewed the group as an organic whole) later to refer to it as the mediating model and then the interactionist model (Schwartz, 1977). The model initially proposed by Schwartz has been further developed most notably by Lawrence Shulman and Alex Gitterman, who have since referred to this model as the Mutual Aid Model (Gitterman, 2004, 2005; Shulman, 1979, 1992, 1999, 2005b). =Cognitive- behavioral group work= The Cognitive-Behavioral Group Work Model is recognized as influential contemporary group work practice approach (Rose, 2004). The approach suggested by Rose (1989, 2004) integrates cognitive and behavioral interventions with small group strategies. While primacy is not placed on establishing the group as a mutual aid system in quite the same way as with the Mutual Aid Model, Rose (2004) suggests the worker promote group discussion and member interaction. Furthermore, drawing upon Yalom's Therapeutic Factor construct Rose (2004) points out the benefits of universality, altruism, and group cohesion as well as mutual reinforcement, factors which are conceptually resonant with mutual aid. Special considerations =Group work with mandated members= The involuntary client can be understood as someone who is pressured by some external source to seek social services (Rooney and Chovanec, 2004). Mandated involuntary clients are pressured to seek services as a result of the legal system (Rooney & Chovanec, 2004). Rooney and Chovanec (2004) identify reactance theory as an explanatory framework for the attitude and behaviors of the involuntary client and the mandated involuntary client. Reactance theory suggests that as a person is pressured to relinquish certain behaviors as a result of treatment efforts they experience reactance, \\"a motivational drive to restore those free behaviors\\" (Rooney & Chovanec, 2004, p. 213). Rooney and Chovanec (2004) suggest an approach that draws upon the Transtheoretical (Stages of Change) Model and Motivational Interviewing in identifying strategies for engaging involuntary clients in the group process. Tom Caplan (2008) suggests the Needs ABC Model. Behroozi (1992) has noted tensions between the concept of working with mandated clients and professional ethics, such as the belief in fostering self-determination. The chief concern is whether or not \\"involuntary applicants\\" are in fact \\"clients\\", as to become a client of a professional social worker requires \\"mutual agreement\\" (Behroozi, 1992, p. 224). In social work practice, the primary task given this issue is to help the applicant \\"transform to clienthood\\" (Behroozi, 1992, p. 224). In the absence of this transformation, the mandated \\"client\\" is likely to be superficially compliant and deny they have any problems warranting social work attention (Behroozi, 1992; Breton, 1993; Milgram & Rubin, 1992). =Open-ended groups= Most conceptualizations of group development are predicated on the belief that the group is closed, with unchanging membership (Schopler & Galinsky, 1990). The findings of an exploratory study conducted by Schopler and Galinsky (1990) concluded that movement beyond beginnings is possible. However, the impact of open membership is likely to result in a more cyclical pattern of group development with regression occurring when members enter and/or leave the group (Schopler & Galinsky, 1990). As a concept, open-endedness exists along a continuum dependent upon the duration of the group (Gitterman, 1989; Schopler and Galinsky, 1995a; Shulman, 2006). When membership is open but the group is of a long duration a core group of members is likely to emerge (Schopler and Galinsky, 1995a; Shulman, 1999, 2006). When this occurs the core group assumes responsibilities for indoctrinating new members (Gitterman, 1989; Schopler & Galinsky, 1995a; Shulman, 1999).

The episode was written by Henry Alonso Myers and directed by Wendey Stanzler. The episode takes its title from the phrase \\"something wicked this way comes\\", as well as the fact that this episode features the popular Broadway musical Wicked as a date venue. Plot The day begins with Betty creeping down the stairs, trying to sneak out. Ignacio catches her and rushes her to the kitchen, as they celebrate Hilda's first week at her new salon job, so he's planned a celebration. But Betty says she's going to the movies, which is what Ignacio didn't want to hear, since he was hoping that she got over her feelings for Henry, plus he wanted her to stick around for the family's sake, even to the point of the entire Suarez family asking to go with her to the cinema. However, Betty does sneak away...and meets up with Henry, waiting behind the trash can, to tell him that she can't go. He already knows: \\"Your family is really loud.\\" Henry is frustrated that Betty has so many friends who don't want her to be alone, and says that they see less of each other now than they did when they weren't going out. Henry believes that they should tell people that they're going out, but nixes the idea, saying the utter stupidity of what they're doing makes this impossible. The following day Christina, who was putting together swimwear designs, notices Betty having something else on her mind, so she talks to her about intervention, using doughnuts as an example. Christina then figures out that Betty and Henry are seeing each other secretly when she starts noticing the two fidget awkwardly, and Christina realizes that Henry is Betty's \\"doughnuts\\". Christina thinks that it's crazy, but hot. Bradford continues berating Daniel for losing the Atlantic Attire account, saying that Daniel should have lied to Luke Carnes and he could have taken Alexis's name off the masthead for a few months. Bradford can't believe Daniel couldn't think of a way to keep their business, and Alexis says that she has some contacts at Ralph Lauren from her time at Hudson. Daniel meekly says that he has contacts, too, but Bradford tells him that he's done enough, and that Alexis will take care of it. Elsewhere, Gio returns to tell Betty about the sandwich business he's launching and hands her a flyer for Gio's Sandwiches. After that conversation, Betty spots a dejected Daniel, who can't believe that Bradford has begun to bond with Alexis a lot more than ever. Betty later goes to get Henry to \\"sign\\" something, and drops it under the desk. The two pop under there, where Betty asks if Henry wants to go on a real date to see Wicked. However, they bump into Daniel, who tells her that if she were seeing Henry he'd have to fire him to save Betty from certain heartache. Later on, Betty, who tried to get tickets but learns that they are sold out, lies to Daniel that she's dating Gio. At lunchtime, Daniel tries to coerce Betty into looking under the bun of his sandwich, where he put the ad for Wicked in his turkey and Swiss, because he got Betty and Gio tickets. He says that MODE has access to house seats, so Amanda can get tickets for just about anything. As Betty ships Daniel off to a meeting with advertisers before asking if she can have the tickets, he tells her he gave them to her \\"boyfriend,\\" Gio, who later gives Betty one of the tickets because he doesn't think that she should be with Henry either, which causes Betty to fume profusely. Betty then walks up to Amanda, who tells Betty that if she wants her to help her to get another set of tickets, Betty will have to walk Halston for one month...in her bathing suit. Hours later, Becks is there to hear Daniel's failure meeting with the advertisers. As Becks looks at the list of advertisers, he comes up with Sandra Winthrop, who owns a jewelry company. She's over fifty and foxy, says Becks, who adds that \\"If you want to land your advertiser, you have to land your advertisers.\\" It looks like Marc is doing his best to keeping his relationship with Cliff at arm's length. First he sends Amanda running when he sees Cliff coming, then pushes him toward the elevator, and Cliff asks if they'll have dinner tonight at a locale other than one of their apartments. Later that day he tells Cliff on the phone that Wili ordered him to stay late. When Cliff shows up to see Marc several hours later, Amanda pops in, and Marc introduces Cliff as his \\"friend.\\" Cliff then breaks up with Marc after he realizes that Marc is ashamed to introduce him to anyone. Cliff is outraged, and tells Amanda he is‚Äîor was‚ÄîMarc's boyfriend and tells Marc that he is upset over his treatment of their relationship. Marc had feared telling Wilhelmina that her daughter Nico won't be able to be her maid of honor because of a bad monkey bite, but Wilhelmina was more preoccupied with having to put on some weight (six pounds) before her next fitting with Vera Wang, not to mention being upset over the caterer segregating the chocolates for the reception. Later on, in the ladies room, Amanda tells Marc about how he was treating Cliff as Marc ponders what would happen if dumped Cliff and ended up all alone. They also talked about Marc knowing about how Nico is just avoiding her upcoming nuptials and that Wilhelmina doesn't really love Bradford. Wilhelmina overhears Marc and Amanda gossiping about her, and would confront Marc about it in her office moments later, saying that she hoping that Nico would show up but vows that she won't be alone. Wilhelmina then calls Victoria \\"Posh\\" Beckham to ask her to be her maid of honor, and Marc calls Cliff to apologize. Back at the Suarezes, Justin, who was trading collectible \\"Playbill\\"s, learns from his friend that instead of working at the salon, Hilda is actually waiting tables at \\"High Beams.\\" His friend says \\"It's like Hooters, just not as classy.\\" They also shows Justin a video of her dad's waitress, who is Hilda. When Hilda arrives home, Justin tells his mother that he knows about her working at High Beams. Hilda then tells Justin that she was fired from the beauty salon and that she needed to make money to support the family, which disappointed Justin. When Betty and Henry show up at the theatre to see Wicked, they run into Gio in the lobby. It turns out that Daniel and Sandra are there, too, so Betty ends up sitting with Gio and Henry sits with Gio's little sister, Antonella, who seems to not like Betty after she asks her about being too old for braces. Henry is jealous to see that Gio has his arm around Betty, and Betty isn't pleased to see Daniel getting cozy with Sandra, just to save the magazine. Betty and Henry almost get caught kissing in the lobby, so they sneak backstage, while Daniel and Sandra sneak into the coat- check room, where Daniel starts having second thoughts about seducing Sandra, who likes the idea of being seduced. Eventually he decides against this but does convince Sandra to advertise in MODE, even though she would pass on a celebration offered by him. Betty and Henry begin to argue over how to handle this relationship, but as they are running around looking for a place to be alone, they find themselves accidentally onstage via Glinda's bubble, shocking everyone in the audience and the cast. After the two are thrown out and banned for life from all productions of Wicked, Betty realizes that her purse is still in the building. Daniel then confronts Betty and asks her why she's being so stupid, setting herself up for heartache, but she says it's her heart. Daniel thinks she is making a mistake and leaves. Betty then she decides to just go home to talk to Hilda, who also tells her that she's stupid, but for not choosing to spend every moment that she can with the man she loves, no matter how long or short their time together will be, so Betty goes to Henry, where they have their night of Wicked-ness together. Meanwhile, Justin and Ignacio surprise Hilda with a new salon chair and hair dryer so she can start her own business, which was used with \\"Playbill\\"s that Justin traded in for money. Production Scenes from the episode were filmed on location at the Pantages Theatre with the Los Angeles production company of the hit musical Wicked, which was a stand-in for the Broadway production.From The Futon Critic In this production, Megan Hilty and original Broadway standby Eden Espinosa played Glinda and Elphaba respectively. However, that this wasn't a real show is obvious in the fact that at the end of \\"Popular\\", Elphaba is still seen on stage next to Glinda when she is supposed to have left, as well as Glinda's bubble (with Henry and Betty on it) moving during \\"Defying Gravity\\" as the bubble isn't used at all during that number. The use of Wicked was one of many Broadway-themed episodes that have influenced the series. In a July 29, 2007 interview with Playbill, producer Marco Pennette expressed his love for the musicals and its performers: \\"I love theatre actors,\\" says Pennette. \\"I grew up back east (he was born in Greenwich, Connecticut), and I'm a big lover of theatre. I want to go into theatre; TV sort of lured me away...\\"From Playbill.com (July 29, 2007) Reception There were some mixed reviews over this episode because of the \\"plug\\" for \\"Wicked.\\" In a recap from Entertainment Weekly, reviewer Kate Ward described it as, \\"If after last night's episode, you didn't stand up, walk to your computer and log onto Ticketmaster while chanting, Must...see...Wicked, well, then consider yourself immune to all influences. Because if Ugly Betty wasn't just one giant commercial for the Broadway show, I don't know what was.\\"From EW.com All in all, reception of the episode was mostly positive. Despite reviews, audiences loved the element of romance between Betty and Henry and how they finally decided to go against all possible odds to have their first night together. Ratings The episode was watched by 9.9 million viewers in the US and had a 7.3 rating, according to ABC.From The Futon Critic While the episode was second behind CBS' installment of Survivor: China, the showing helped contributed the network's Thursday night win in the first night of the 2007 November TV sweeps. 5.0 million watched this episode in the UK, keeping its 5.05 million average with an 18% audience share, placing first.

Family His brothers Sol and Billy were also footballers, as was a fourth brother, Jack. His nephew Arthur (son of Sol) was also a footballer. Playing career Tremelling was born in Newhall, Derbyshire. He first played for his local team, Langwith Colliery Junction Wagon Works, as a full back, but went in goal when they were hit by injuries. He played for Mansfield Town, and appeared for Lincoln City in wartime competition, but moved to Birmingham before league football resumed after the First World War. He went straight in as first choice goalkeeper, and remained so for eleven seasons, until Harry Hibbs took over in the 1929‚Äì30 season. He played a key role in the destination of the First Division title on the final day of the 1923‚Äì24 season. His Birmingham City side faced Cardiff City who needed a win to take the title. Cardiff were awarded a penalty but Tremelling saved Len Davies' penalty kick as the match finished 0‚Äì0, ensuring that Herbert Chapman's Huddersfield Town won the title by 0.024 of a goal. He won his only full cap for England on 28 November 1927, in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Wales played at Turf Moor, Burnley. He moved to Bury in May 1932, but returned to Birmingham in June 1936 as assistant trainer, a position which he held for five years.

Life  Maule was born in Edmonton, Middlesex. His father, Henry, was a physician and his mother, Hannah n√©e Rawson, a Quaker. He was educated at a private school then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was senior wrangler and Smith's prize winner in 1810 and where he became a fellow in 1811. He initially remained in Cambridge, where he was a close friend of Charles Babbage, and worked as a mathematics tutor, including Edward RyanFitzGerald (2004) and Cresswell CresswellGetzler, J. S. (2004) \\"Cresswell, Sir Cresswell (1793‚Äì1863)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, accessed 12 August 2007 among his students. He was offered the post of professor of mathematics at the East India College but, in 1810, Maule had already entered Lincoln's Inn with the intention of practising law. He was called to the bar in 1814 and began practice in commercial law, especially marine insurance, at 3 Essex Court. Maule was appointed King's Council in 1833 and in 1835 became counsel to the Bank of England, succeeding Sir James Scarlett. His retention by the bank did not prevent him from acting for Nicholas Aylward Vigors who faced an election petition over his County Carlow by-election victory in February 1837. Maule's success established his reputation in the region and he himself was elected for Carlow Borough in the 1837 United Kingdom general election of August. Maule's ironic address in 1845 to a convicted bigamist was said to have contributed to the climate of opinion which led to the passage of the 1857 Divorce Act: > Prisoner at the bar, you have been convicted before me of what the law > regards as a very grave and serious offence, that of going through the > marriage ceremony a second time while your wife was still alive... You plead > in mitigation of your conduct that she was given to dissipation and > drunkenness, that she proved herself a curse to your household while she > remained mistress of it, and that she had latterly deserted you; but I am > not permitted to recognise any such plea... The law in its wisdom points out > a means by which you might rid yourself from further association with a > woman who had dishonoured you; but you did not think proper to adopt it. I > will tell you what that process is. You ought first to have brought an > action against your wife's seducer if you could discover him; that might > have cost you money, and you say you are a poor working man, but that is not > the fault of the law. You would then be obliged to prove by evidence your > wife's criminalty in a court of justice, and thus obtain a verdict with > damages against the defendant, who was not unlikely to turn out to be a > pauper. But so jealous is the law (which you ought to be aware is the > perfection of reason) of the sanctity of the marriage tie, that in > accomplishing all this you would only have fulfilled the lighter portion of > your duty. You must then have gone, with your verdict in your hand, and > petitioned the House of Lords for a divorce, it would cost you perhaps five > or six hundred pounds, and you do not seem to be worth as many pence. But it > is the boast of the law that it is impartial, and makes no difference > between the rich and the poor. The wealthiest man in the kingdom would have > had to pay no less than that sum for the same luxury; so that you would have > no reason to complain. You would, of course, have to prove your case over > again, and at the end of a year, or possibly two, you might obtain a decree > which would enable you legally to do what you have thought proper to do > without it. You have thus wilfully rejected the boon the legislature offered > you, and it is my duty to pass upon you such sentence as I think your > offence deserves, and that sentence is, that you be imprisoned for one day; > and inasmuch as the present assizes is three days old, the result is that > you will be immediately discharged. Maule was knighted and appointed a Baron of the Court of the Exchequer in 1839, transferring to the Court of Common Pleas later that year. He was a practical and knowledgeable judge with a fine judicial sense of humour (witness his pointed opinion in a case of wife selling, and his refusal to follow any case reported in Espinasse's Reports, on the ground that the author was \\"just another ass\\"). Maule was the only judge to dissent (in part) on the ruling in M'Naghten's Case, which laid down the legal definition of insanity.http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1843/J16.html Maule retired from the bench because of poor health in 1855 but became a Privy Councillor. Maule never married, sharing a house with his widowed sister, Emma Maria Leathley, and unmarried niece, Emma Leathley. He died at home in London.

Based on Hong Seok-jung's 2002 novel Hwangjini (which won the Manhae Prize for Literature in 2004), the film is about the life of Hwang Jin- yi, the most famous courtesan (or \\"gisaeng\\") in Korean history, starring Song Hye-kyo in the title role. Plot Raised as an aristocrat in 16th century Joseon, an era when class status dictated one's destiny, Hwang Jin-yi discovers a shocking secret about her birth: she was born illegitimate. She therefore belongs to the lower class, and has no recourse but to give up her aristocratic status. Before embarking on the life of a gisaeng, she decides to give up her virginity to a man of her own choosing, and spends her first night with Nomi, a long-time family servant, whom she is aware loves her deeply. As a gisaeng, Jin-yi becomes celebrated for her legendary beauty, wit, and talents in singing, dancing and poetry. But although she is surrounded by an entourage of noblemen showering her with gifts and admiration, she lives a solitary life of tragic isolation. Jin-yi's only solace is the game she and the local governor play on her noble clients, tricking them into exposing their hypocrisies. But when a bandit leader matching Nomi's description is spotted in the region, Jin-yi begins to question the life she endures.
