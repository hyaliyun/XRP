The novel explores the machinations of the comic book industry, and contains a slightly fictionalized account of the history of mainstream American comics, with particular attention paid to the era of Image Comics.  Publication history  Much of Hicksville was serialized in Horrocks' ten-issue solo series Pickle, published by Black Eye from 1993‚Äì1996. The collected edition, which featured much redrawn art,Hicksville: a Comic Book (Montreal: Drawn & Quarterly, 2001): \\"Portions of this story appeared in a slightly different form in the periodical 'Pickle' from issues 1-10.\\" was released by Black Eye in 1998, shortly before the company went out of business. Hicksville was republished by Canadian publisher Drawn and Quarterly in 2001 and again in 2010. In 2010 the graphic novel was republished by New Zealand publisher Victoria University Press. Hicksville has been translated into Spanish (Astiberri Ediciones), Italian (Black Velvet), German (Reprodukt), French (Casterman) and Croatian (Fibra). Plot Canadian writer Leonard Batts arrives in the tiny New Zealand town of Hicksville to research the early life of Dick Burger, whose work has taken the comic book industry by storm. He finds that Hicksville is a town in which everyone from the postman to the farmer is an expert on comics, yet everyone seems to hate Burger. Many of the book's main characters are themselves comic creators, and many of their strips are reproduced in full as part of the story, most notably Sam Zabel's extensive account of moving to Los Angeles in order to work with Burger, which he documents in his self-published comic Pickle (the title of the Dylan Horrocks series in which the storyline was actually published).  Themes  Horrocks said of Hicksville: Derik Badman writes of the village where much of the book's action takes place:  Characters  Hicksville is a meta-comic and the book's characters include normal (albeit fictional) humans from our world, and comic book characters (all actually created by Horrocks) who appear in various publications ‚Äî such as Laffs magazine, Sam Zabel's Pickle, and the various titles published by Eternal Comics ‚Äî interwoven into the pages of the graphic novel.

Originally based in New Fairfield, Connecticut, before moving to Queens, New York, the group has released eight albums, with their first public release being a 2006 EP entitled The Complete Guide to Needlework. Victory Records has worked with the band throughout most of their career, starting with Goodbye to the Gallows (2007). Their second, third and fourth albums The Respect Issue (2008), Felony (2009) and Speaker of the Dead (2011) were all distributed through Victory as well. After the band's initial four-album contract with Victory expired, they signed again with Victory to distribute their fifth and sixth studio albums, Slave to the Game (2012) and Eternal Enemies (2014). However after nine years of being signed to the label, Emmure would leave Victory in 2016 to sign with SharpTone. The seventh and eighth Emmure albums, titled Look at Yourself and Hindsight were released on March 3, 2017 and June 26, 2020 respectively. The band's vocalist, Frankie Palmeri (born 1986), is the only remaining original member and has been subject to some controversy over the years. His personality has made the band unique from other acts in the genre, and critics have described his \\"no-fucks-given\\" attitude as an entertaining standpoint for the band. History Early years Emmure was started in 2003. Frankie Palmeri (from Queens, New York) met Joe and Ben Lionetti (from New Fairfield, Connecticut) through an internet message board. Palmeri then traveled to Connecticut to begin rehearsals together. Bassist Dan Steindler and guitarist Jesse Ketive, residents of New Fairfield and Queens, respectively, then joined when the three began another recruiting search for members. The band named themselves \\"Emmure\\", being a reference to the act of immurement, which is a form of execution. In 2004, bassist Steindler left the band and was later replaced by Mark Davis, which marked the first ever lineup change in the band. Ketive was formerly in the band Warfix, in which he played guitar alongside Sean Murphy and Mike Kaabe of Endwell (Kaabe eventually joining Emmure himself in April 2009) and Bryan Goldsman of Southside Panic (and co-producer of Felony). The band recorded some demo tapes and played local gigs around the New York area from 2003 - 2005. Palmeri proclaimed that in 2005, the band \\"started becoming more serious‚Äù. Victory Records signing and touring (2007-2012) In 2008, the band finished a tour in the lower 48 US states supporting Misery Signals, August Burns Red, and Burn Down Rome. That summer was spent on their headlining tour with Endwell, On Broken Wings, Ligeia, Recon, Unite and Conquer, Carnifex and others. On May 1, 2009, rumors of the Lionetti brothers' departure from the band, due to conflict between members, were confirmed in a statement from Joe Lionetti. According to its page on Victory Records' web site, Emmure found a new guitarist and drummer in Mike Mulholland and Michael Kaabe, respectively. Mike Kaabe formerly played with Warfix, Hulk Blood, and Endwell and is also the step-brother of Emmure guitarist Jesse Ketive. On June 20, 2009 the music video of \\"False Love in Real Life\\" was broadcast on MTV's Headbanger's Ball, which was directed by Frankie Nasso. Nasso previously directed the video to \\"Sound Wave Superior\\" as well. Emmure completed their third studio album, Felony, released on August 18, 2009 on Victory Records. The album, of which, is allegedly inspired by a real event in which vocalist Frankie Palmeri assaulted his best friend by \\"[hitting] him in the head with a bottle\\", which resulted in Palmeri being arrested. Following the release of the album, Emmure was announced as one of the groups to be featured on 2010's Warped Tour as well as The Bamboozle. The group was included on Attack Attack!'s headlining This Is a Family Tour alongside Of Mice & Men, Pierce the Veil and In Fear and Faith. They embarked on the Reckless and Relentless Tour with Asking Alexandria, Chiodos, Miss May I, Evergreen Terrace, and Lower than Atlantis and have joined the Never Say Die! tour across Europe along with Parkway Drive, Comeback Kid, Bleeding Through, War From a Harlots Mouth, Your Demise and We Came as Romans. Emmure released their next album, Speaker of the Dead on February 15, 2011. On January 18, 2011, Emmure released a single from the album Demons with Ryu onto iTunes. On February 9, 2011, the music video for \\"Solar Flare Homicide\\" premiered. Speaker of the Dead debuted at number 68 on the Billboard 200 and number 11 on the top Independent Albums. They toured in The Mosh Lives tour with Visions, We Set the Sun, Iwrestledabearonce, War from a Harlots Mouth, and Winds of Plague in Europe. The group also co-headlined the All Stars Tour in summer of 2011 with Alesana, Blessthefall, The Ghost Inside, In This Moment, Motionless in White, and many other bands. The band also co-headlined the Never Say Die tour with Vanna, The Human Abstract, As Blood Runs Black, The Word Alive, Deez Nuts, and Suicide Silence. In October 2011, drummer Mike Kaabe was fired from the band after multiple conflicts with the band's members as well as the band's manager. On January 4, 2012, guitarist Jesse Ketive confirmed that the band began recording their fifth album with producer Joey Sturgis, who produced their previous release Speaker of the Dead. Four days following this, Lambgoat revealed that ex-Bury Your Dead and Crossfade drummer Mark Castillo had joined Emmure for the recording of their fifth full-length. Castillo later confirmed that he would be leaving Crossfade to drum for Emmure full-time. The album was announced to be titled Slave to the Game and would be released on April 10, 2012. Prior to the recording of Slave to the Game, Emmure re-signed with Victory Records after their previous four-album contract's expiration. On February 3, 2012, Emmure released a video for \\"Drug Dealer Friend\\". On March 7, 2012, the band released their first single from Slave to the Game, entitled \\"Protoman\\", which was later released digitally, concurrently with the album's second single \\"I Am Onslaught\\". A video was later shot and released for \\"Protoman\\". On May 25, 2012, it was announced that the band was filming a video for the track \\"MDMA\\", thus making it the third single from Slave to the Game. Slave to the Game was positively received by criticts, however, Palmeri has heavily panned the album insisting that it's a commercial failure. In a 2017 interview, he stated ‚ÄúThe songs suck. It‚Äôs just not good. None of the riffs are good. I just don‚Äôt like it. I feel bad ‚Äòcause I let that record happen.‚Äù Continued success (2012-2015) Emmure at a signing table during 2013's Mayhem Festival. From July 13 ‚Äì August 28, 2012, Emmure took part in Metal Hammer's \\"Trespass America Festival\\" headlined by Five Finger Death Punch with additional support from Battlecross, God Forbid, Pop Evil, Trivium and Killswitch Engage. The band also confirmed they had once again re-signed with Victory Records for their sixth album, which will be recorded towards the end of 2013 with a planned release for Spring 2014. On February 18, they announced the release of their sixth album, Eternal Enemies, which will be released via-Victory Records on April 15, 2014. It was officially announced on July 2 that drummer Castillo quit the band \\"under amicable circumstances.\\" The same month, rapper Riff Raff released a remix of his song \\"2 Girls 1 Pipe\\" that features Frankie Palmeri. Emmure also supported Parkway Drive on their Atlas 2012 European tour with The Word Alive and Structures also joining them From November 11 to December 12. The band was also featured on the entire Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival in 2014 with bands like Avenged Sevenfold, Korn, Cannibal Corpse, Suicide Silence, Trivium, Asking Alexandria, Miss May I, Veil of Maya, Upon a Burning Body and Body Count. On November 20, 2014, Emmure began their headline US tour, the Eternal Enemies Tour. In support were The Acacia Strain, Fit for a King, Kublai Khan, and Sylar. The tour ended on December 21, 2014 in New York. Stray from the Path was originally slated to also appear on the tour, but dropped off weeks before its commencement to allow them to finish an upcoming album. It was simultaneously announced that Sylar would take their place on the tour. The Eternal Enemies Tour was much anticipated due to the fact that Emmure and The Acacia Strain once had a well publicized feud back in 2009, which has since cooled, and both co-headlined the tour. The two bands' former feud was often parodied by promotional posters for the tour, including a bill and a teaser video both advertising that the tour was \\"Emmure vs. The Acacia Strain\\". In February 2015, Emmure and Suicide Silence did a co-headlining tour in the United States with support from Within the Ruins and Fit for an Autopsy. However, vocalist Palmeri damaged his voice and was unable to perform for a leg of the tour. He was, however, able to return to singing again on March 13. A European tour with Caliban, Thy Art Is Murder and Sworn In was also announced. But it was canceled since Palmeri still had severe acute and chronic reflux laryngitis and a weak left vocal cord. Emmure began to tour again in September with Hatebreed at the UK's GhostFest. As well as two headlining shows in Russia with Born of Osiris as support. In October 2015, Emmure was originally going to support All That Remains and We Came as Romans on the Hardrive Live Fallout tour. But due to personal issues within the band, Emmure dropped off the tour.  Line-up departure, new members, and Look at Yourself (2015-2018)  On December 22, 2015, it was reported by mass sources including Alternative Press and Lambgoat that all members apart from vocalist Frankie Palmeri had departed from the group. There is a conflicting debate on the reason for the members' exit. Longtime bassist Mark Davis announced that they would be forming a project of their own, and stated in another interview that the reason for the members' exit from Emmure involved Palmeri not letting the band play a line of scheduled US shows, he concluded this by saying ‚ÄúIf someone is bringing you down or holding you back from your full potential, it's time to cut them out, no matter how much you may love them.‚Äù Palmeri, on the other hand, stated in an interview with Blabbermouth; \\"to me, they lost the passion for playing in Emmure a long time ago.\\" Months later Palmeri revealed the new Emmure lineup during a comeback show Oberhausen, Germany, which includes current and past members of Glass Cloud and the now-defunct Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza. Emmure announced their departure from Victory Records on October 13, 2016 and had signed with SharpTone Records, while also releasing the first single \\"Torch\\" from their upcoming album, titled Look at Yourself. On December 16, 2016, the band released \\"Russian Hotel Aftermath\\", the second single. Emmure toured well into 2017, the band supported After the Burial on their Carry the Flame tour alongside Fit for A King, Fit for An Autopsy and Invent, Animate in the Winter of 2017. Emmure also played on the entire 2017 Vans Warped Tour, the band appeared on the Monster Energy Stage. Emmure also returned to Europe in the Fall of 2017, playing on the Never Say Die tour. They headlined the tour alongside Deez Nuts and Chelsea Grin. Kublai Khan, Sworn In, Polaris and Lorna Shore all joined up as support on the tour. Emmure returned to Australia in the February of 2018, as they supported Thy Art is Murder on their headliner with Fit for an Autopsy and Justice for the Damned also rounding up the lineup. The band also did a short run in Japan during February. Emmure did a USA headliner in the Spring of 2018, Counterparts, King 810 and Varials all joined the tour as main support. Emmure opened up for Thy Art is Murder once again on the European Death Dealers tour. Miss May I and Knocked Loose were also part of the lineup. In the Fall of 2018, Emmure and Stick to Your Guns co-headlined a tour throughout the Fall of 2018. Wage War and Sanction joined the lineup as support.  Hindsight (2019-present)  In the Spring of 2019, Emmure headlined another European tour once again with Rise of the North Star, Obey the Brave, Fit for A King and Alpha Wolf. Vocalist Frankie Palmeri confirmed via a tweet on August 19, 2019 that the band had entered the studio to begin recording their eighth full-length album. The band opened up for As I Lay Dying on their Shaped by Fire Tour with After the Burial. Emmure will open up for As I Lay Dying once again, this time in Europe with Whitechapel and Une Mis√®re joining the lineup.

On March 13, 2020, they released the album's second single \\"Gypsy Disco\\"(Directed by Eric DiCarlo/SquareUp Studios) continuing with the quote \\"HINDSIGHT IS 2020\\" on Twitter. After recording of the album had finished members moved onto other projects. When the COViD-19 Pandemic began members began needing to gain more revenue. Guitarist Joshua Travis has released new solo music, Josh \\"Baby J\\" Miller began a new band with Chelsea Grin vocalist Tom Barber called Darko. and Frankie Palmeri has begun streaming on twitch and revived his podcast. On May 29, 2020, the band released the album's third single \\"Uncontrollable Descent\\" not only with the slogan \\"HINDSIGHT IS 2020\\" but the album cover and the song features a sample saying \\"HINDSIGHT\\" in the outro. The band then released the fourth single \\"I've Scene God\\" on 12th June 2020. The album was released on the aforementioned date and received generally positive reviews, most noting how the album still has Emmure's signature Deathcore and Nu Metal influences but the latter are far more prominent on this record than any before. Musical style, influences and lyrical themes Vocalist Frankie Palmeri has a broad array of influences. Musical style Emmure has been described as deathcore and metalcore with added elements of nu metal and alternative metal. The band has received both praise and criticism for the abundance of breakdowns in their music. Spoken words, death growls, shrieks, breakdowns, rapping and dissonant chords are often featured in Emmure's music. Lyrical themes Lyrical topics that Emmure touches upon usually focus on breakups, social indifference, philosophy, and religion. Many of the band's songs contain references to video games and comic books, particularly from Street Fighter and Marvel Comics, of which vocalist Frankie Palmeri is an avid fan. However, in a 2013 interview with Get Your Rock Out, Palmeri explained that he would not be writing songs based on metaphors involving Marvel Comics characters any longer as he felt that \\"those avenues are not the correct catharsis for the band anymore.\\" On February 15, 2020, Frankie Palmieri tweeted about his past lyrics, watch this video on the topic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3JRuJyAM-Y Influences Frankie Palmeri has stated that he is influenced by Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit and Jonathan Davis of Korn. He has also stated his band are also influenced by Chimaira, Fear Factory, Candiria and Hatebreed. Controversy Emmure's frontman Frankie Palmeri was subject to controversy when a line of T-shirts under his name began being produced that depicted an image of assailants Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold during the Columbine massacre coupled with the phrase \\"Shoot First Ask Questions Last\\" and another line with a scene from American History X which states \\"Violence As A Way of Life\\". Several journalists criticized the designs as \\"poorly designed\\" and \\"terribly offensive\\" while lacking any purpose or social commentary other than to stir controversy. Additionally, Palmeri has been quoted in a variety of online rants in which he uses the words \\"faggot\\" and \\"nigga\\" repeatedly, moves which have caused some observers to label him a racist and homophobic. With the release of a track-listing for their album Eternal Enemies on February 18, 2014, the band sparked another bit of controversy based around the name of the first track, \\"Bring a Gun to School\\", leading their ex-rhythm guitarist Ben Lionetti to post a statement regarding his former band and addressing the track, and referred to Palmeri as a \\"disgusting human being\\". He threatened legal action against the band, the label that holds them and their management in order to reclaim what is \\"owed to him\\" and his brother Joe, who is also a former member of the band. Ultimately, Emmure changed the title of the song to simply \\"(Untitled)\\" due to the outcry.

Plot  The film follows Patrick Marlowe (who is on sabbatical), his paleontologist wife Dr. Julie Marlowe, and their children, as they leave the big city for Julie's dinosaur dig in Saskatchewan's Avonlea Badlands (located south of Regina). To be close to the dig the family moves to the fictional small town of Beacon Vista. On their way to Beacon Vista, their mildly autistic son Danny is almost kidnapped by a trucker, who had previously helped them change a tire while flirting with the daughter Gwyneth. The family quickly finds some oddities about their new home. Cell phones don't work, and the local minister preaches the end is near. The family wakes up after their first night in the new home to discover that a triple murder, a mother and two children whose husband/father is working on an oil rig, occurred next door while they slept. Later, while both playing a video game and sleeping, Danny has some sort of psychic vision related to the murders. Patrick also has a back-story involving a scam he pulled with Jack Driscoll (a now dead former coworker) and some related missing money. The last revelations of the film are that the murders, and possibly some local teens, are connected to devil worship. While Sabbatical and Sabbath are related in their connection to time off and generally have positive connotations, the root sabbat is also used for Wiccan holidays, and has a history of negative connotations in fictional works (music, and games).

State House is in chaos as Sansom steps aside. St. Petersburg Times, 2009-01-30. In April 2009, a grand jury indicted Speaker of the House Ray Samson, president of Northwest Florida State College Bob Richburg and businessman and political campaign contributor Jay Odom. They were charged with official misconduct, a third-degree felony which could result in a five-year prison sentence. On February 21, Sansom resigned as Speaker of the House and his seat as a State Representative under threat of expulsion by the Republican House, on the eve of the beginning of his trial for misconduct. Charges were dismissed, appealed, and dismissed again, until all charges were dismissed. Speaker Pro Temp Cretul was unanimously elected his successor, and was formally elected Speaker on March 3, the first day of the regular legislative session. Criminal case A circuit judge dismissed most of the charges in October and an appellate court reaffirmed the judge's ruling on the last day of 2009.Leary, Alex: \\"Sansom charges in airport deal escalate to grand theft\\" St. Petersburg Times, 2010-01-07 After losing the appeal on the first round of charges, on January 6, 2010, the Leon County State Attorney Willie Meggs charged the trio with grand theft and conspiracy. Attorneys for Sansom and his co-defendants in the criminal trial - former college President Bob Richburg and developer Jay Odom - wanted Meggs removed from the case for \\"prosecutorial misconduct\\". March 28, 2011, Prosecutors dropped all charges against former House Speaker Ray Sansom and Odem.

Rundown After receiving a bachelor's degree in Art from the University of Puerto Rico, Trelles enrolled as a graduate student at the University of Mexico in Mexico City, where he eventually earned a doctorate. In 1985 he moved to the Canary Islands in Spain to develop the key work that would envision the art making process of his later works in regards to alchemy, mysticism, magic and suspicion. Though he never quite understood the true value of Dada against the sound factories of the industrial revolution, Trelles over-seeded the figurative aspect of Surrealism in resemblance to printmaking by Dutch Painters during the Baroque Age to clear cut some of the tensions behind Pop Art and New Realism in regards to 1963's Soir√©e. His small connotations to the world of ghost hinduism and buddhist antiGothics is highly denoted throughout much of his paintings with dust etching nograffiti and squashed expressionism. Some of his later works resemble the antithesis to David Carson's Fotografiks, paintings with a graphic attitude, and Takashi Murakami's public New York City exhibitions from Japan's Exploding Subculture. Figurations on Plastic Figurations on Plastic (Figuraciones sobre Pl√°stico in Spanish) is an exhibition by two artists in the field of post-modern surrealist figuration, Rafael Trelles in conjunction with Mar√≠a Antonieta Ord√≥√±ez. According to Manuel Alvarez Lezama, Trelles and Ord√≥√±ez have accepted the challenge to turn the human figure into poetry by using plastic as their support to let us see ourselves on plastic, an everyday reality for millions in this technology-oriented society of ours.Lezama MA, Landmark exhibition: Ord√≥√±ez and Trelles in 'Figuraciones sobre pl√°stico', San Juan Star Document ID: 11D0D6F57A88C590, November 18, 2007.

On Concrete (Urban Graphic in Buenos Aires) ‚Äì Documentary (2007) En Concreto (translates to On Concrete) is an artistic project of urban interventions developed by Rafael Trelles since the summer of 2004 on the walls, side walks and utility poles of several cities including the island of Vieques. It's an experimental graphic work originally designed for placing in abandoned sectors of worldwide cities. Proyecto 'ace traces and documents the development of this landmark public exhibition in the city of Buenos Aires into film. Life and education Rafael Trelles was born on April 27, 1957 in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He began studying painting at the age of eleven, under the guidance of Spanish painter Julio Yort. In 1980, Trelles obtained a Magna Cum Laude bachelor's degree in Art at the University of Puerto Rico. In 1983, he traveled to Mexico where he pursued graduate studies at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de M√©xico. Today he lives and work in Puerto Rico.

Khorkhog is made by cooking pieces of meat inside a container which also contains hot stones and water, and is often also heated from the outside. Preparation To make khorkhog, Mongolians take lamb (goat meat can be substituted) and cut it into pieces of an appropriate size while leaving the bones attached. The cook then places ten to twenty fist-sized stones over a fire. When the stones are hot enough, the rocks and the meat are placed in the chosen cooking container. Metal milk jugs are a traditional and typical choice, although any container sturdy enough to hold the hot rocks will serve. The heat of the stones and the steam will cook the meat inside the jug. The cook can also put the jug on a fire or the stove if the stones are not hot enough. The stones will turn black from the heat and the fat they absorb from the lamb. The jug remains covered while the cook listens to and smells the meal to judge when it is ready. The stones can take up to an hour and a half to cook the meat sufficiently. When the dish is ready, the cook hands out portions of meat along with the hot stones which are tossed from hand to hand and are said to have beneficial properties.Khorkhog - Meat cooked with hot stones - Mongolian RecipesVicariously.Through.Me: A Khourhog For Me :-) Diners usually eat khorkhog with their fingers, although knives may be used to slice the meat off the bone.

His death in 1909 became the focus of one of the most publicized murder trials in the early 20th century. Biography Early Life Born on October 21, 1827 in Lincoln County, Kentucky. In his youth, Swope was an avid reader known as \\"bookish and delicate\\". After graduating from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky in 1848, he attended Yale Law School but never practiced the profession. Instead of practicing law, he became interested in real estate and mining in New York and St. Louis. Career Swope was a Yale graduate with money to invest. After living in several states, he eventually made his way to Missouri when he moved to St. Louis and began working in real estate. He came west in 1855 as the Kansas Territory opened and settled in Kansas City in 1857. Swope began purchasing property here and would later go on to become the largest individual land owner in Kansas City. Mr. Swope was called \\"Colonel\\" Swope, but the title was honorary and not from military service. Swope Park In 1893, civic reformers put forth an effort to beautify the city with parks and boulevards. Swope actively opposed the plan because he would be heavily taxed for owning vacant real estate lots. The Kansas City Star responded to his opposition by calling him a greedy mossback who \\"evaded taxes, fighting progress, and getting rich.\\" In 1896, the seventy-year-old Swope donated of land to be used as a public park. The land lay southeast of town and was used to create Swope Park. 18,000 Kansas Citians celebrated opening day for Swope Park with the \\"Colonel\\" wandering around the crowd while they listened to a two hour speech honoring his benefactions. Death Swope's sudden illness and demise happened under mysterious circumstances, as did several others in the family. Swope was known to be mild-mannered and self-conscious, and was a lifelong bachelor. He lived alone until later in life when he moved into the turreted red brick mansion of his late brother Logan Swope, home of his sister-in-law Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Chrisman Swope as well as seven nieces and nephews. The frugal millionaire commuted daily by streetcar to his downtown Kansas City office in the New England Life Building until the month before his death. Swope's last days were preoccupied with how best to bestow his wealth. His real estate alone was worth three and a half million dollars. In his last days Swope was sometimes treated by Doctor Bennett Clark Hyde, who had married one of his nieces (Logan and Margaret Swope's daughter, Frances). On October 3, 1909, just 18 days short of his 82nd birthday, Col. Swope died suddenly in his sister-in-law's home with Dr. Hyde in attendance, the aftermath of a perplexing, brief and violent illness. Swope's body lay in state at the Kansas City Public Library where thousands of mourners paid their respects. Until a tomb could be prepared in Swope Park where he had requested burial, he lay in a holding vault. Three months after Swope's death, Dr. Hyde came under suspicion and was charged with murder by strychnine poisoning in \\"a plot for money.\\"Dr. Hyde Arrested As Swope's Slayer; Accused of First Degree Murder, He Has Hearing and Is Released on Bail New York Times, Friday, February 11, 1910, page 1A. The body of Thomas Hunton Swope was exhumed by coroner Ludvig Hektoen and an autopsy performed. At his request, Walter Stanley Haines conducted a postmortem examination of the internal organs and reported that Thomas Hunton Swope's body contained lethal amounts of both strychnine and cyanide. Hyde was charged, tried and convicted on May 16, 1910, of the murder of Thomas Swope. On appeal, the verdict was overturned on procedural grounds. Three more trials, seven years and a quarter of a million dollars later, the charges against Hyde were dropped and he was released. Eight and a half years after his death, Col. Thomas Swope was laid to rest in Swope Park. On April 8, 1918, he was buried high on a hill amid a forest of trees, overlooking his gift to Kansas City. His remains lie beneath a Greek temple of white granite, guarded by a pair of stone lions.

Founded in 1902 by Giovanni Amato, Amato's currently operates 44 stores. Recent expansion has been in the form of franchising. The company also cans its pasta and pizza sauces for sale in Hannaford supermarkets. Headquartered in Portland, Amato's operates over 44 locations. About half of these are located throughout their home state of Maine. The chain also has a strong presence in Vermont (mostly within Maplefields convenience stores), and there are a handful of other locations within New Hampshire. They have expanded into Massachusetts, having opened four locations in November 2019. Amato's is best known for its Italian sandwiches. Its most popular menu item, called \\"The Original Real Italian,\\" was invented in 1902. Giovanni named his sandwiches \\"Italians\\" in honor of his homeland. Unlike other sandwich shops they are served with onions, pickles, tomatoes, green peppers and olives with an Amato's fresh baked roll.\\"Amato's celebrates 100 years of Italians\\", Associated Press in Bangor Daily News, November 29, 2002. History In 1902, Naples native Giovanni Amato (1875‚Äì1959)Giovanni Amato at FindAGrave.com and his wife, Michelina (1878‚Äì1959),Michelina Amato at FindAGrave.com opened a store on India Street in Portland, Maine. According to official literature, Amato's sandwiches contained ham, American cheese, and fresh vegetables, which the Italian immigrants along the waterfront seemed to enjoy. Amato named his sandwich the \\"Italian\\" in honor of his country and his people (not, as is widely believed, because of its ingredients). In 1972, Dominic Reali, an employee at the original Amato's on India Street, purchased the store from his boss. Under Reali, the company increased from one store to thirteen, and began franchising. Today there are 40 locations operating under the Amato's brand. Dominic Reali also added Greek olives, sour pickles, and his own oil (a blend of olive and vegetable oil) to the famous Real Italian. Amato's Xpress In recent years, Amato's has allowed several franchises to operate under the name Amato's Xpress. These locations, found mostly in convenience stores in northern New England, purvey Amato's pizza, pasta, salads, and sandwiches, but fewer specialty items are available. Amato's franchises in Vermont-based Maplefield's gas stations do not use the Amato's Xpress name. Nearly all Amato's stores have dropped the Xpress moniker as of 2011.

When Paul Robinson signed his draft card on September 12, 1918, he was living at 1219 West Jefferson in Sandusky, Ohio, and working as a demurrage railway clerk in the local Big Four freight offices. From clerk to cartoons Peggy Byrd from Paul Robinson's comic strip The Love-Byrds On June 21, 1919, the Sandusky Register reported that Robinson had left Sandusky two months earlier to begin his new career as an artist at the Bray Productions animation studios in New York. He began doing panels and strips for the Central Press Association, continuing with King Features Syndicate after Central Press was purchased by King Features in 1930. Early strips In the mid-1920s, Robinson took over the Samson and Delia strip from Tim Early and the screenwriter and short story author H. C. Witwer. Another Robinson feature of the 1920s was his single-panel series Just Among Us Girls. Etta Kett In 1932, Robinson found success with Etta Kett. The strip about teenager Etta Kett began as a way to teach etiquette to teens, hence its name. Robinson also drew The Love-Byrds, about the cheerful couple Peggy and Howard Byrd, as a topper strip above Etta Kett. Etta Kett's poses, facial features and hair style are all similar to Peggy Byrd. Etta Kett ran in more than 50 American newspapers for almost 50 years, starting December 1925 and continuing until November 24, 1974.

(Francis Constable the publisher is distinct from his contemporary, Francis Constable, esquire, of Burstwick in Yorkshire. Many members of the northern family, earlier and later, shared the name Francis Constable.) Life and work Francis Constable was baptised on 12 May 1592, in Datchet, Buckinghamshire (now co. Berkshire). He was the son of Robert Constable and Margery Barker, the daughter of Christopher Barker, printer to Queen Elizabeth I. Francis had an elder brother Robert Constable baptised at Datchet on 9 September 1590. His brother Robert was apprenticed on 7 December 1607 at the age of 17 to their maternal uncle Robert Barker, printer to James I of England. It is also believed that Francis may have been apprenticed to his maternal uncle Robert Barker, who, holding the Bible patent that he had inherited from his father, in 1611 printed the first edition of the King James Bible while Robert & Francis were still apprentices. Francis became a \\"freedman\\" (a full member) of the Stationers Company on 2 July 1614. His elder brother Robert became a \\"freedman\\" on 12 December 1614. Francis established his independent business at a series of locations in London and Westminster: first at the sign of the White Lion in St. Paul's Churchyard, from 1616‚Äì1624; then under the sign of the Crane, also in St. Paul's Churchyard, 1631; then \\"under St. Martin's Church\\" in Ludgate, 1637; then at King Street in Westminster, at the sign of the Goat, 1640, and at Westminster Hall, 1640. It is probable that he rented a stall in Westminster Hall very much earlier than 1640 but that is the first appearance of the Hall in the imprint of any book.Henry Robert Plomer, A Dictionary of the Booksellers and Printers Who Were at Work in England, Scotland and Ireland from 1641 to 1667, London, The Bibliographical Society/Blades, East & Blades, 1097; p. 51. In his career, Constable sometimes partnered with Humphrey Moseley, one of the most prominent publishers of drama and literature in Constable's generation; he also partnered with other stationers on specific projects. Richard Constable, believed to be a relation of Francis Constable (possibly the son of his brother Robert Constable), was active as a bookseller in the late 1640s.Plomer, p. 52. Francis Constable died 1 August 1647 and was buried the following day at St Margaret, Westminster \\"Mr.\\" is misread \\"Mrs.\\" in his burial entry. His wife Alice was buried 2 days later on 4 August 1647, and his only surviving son Robert, at the age of 16 or close to it, was buried on 28 August 1647. It was after Robert's death that the will of Alice Constable was filed for probate on 22 September 1647. It is believed that they died of the plague that was killing many in London that summer. Drama * Constable's first registered publication was a drama, the first edition of Samuel Daniel's \\"pastoral tragicomedy\\" Hymen's Triumph (January 1615). He published large numbers of plays, in which he was associated for some years with Humphrey Moseley. Among Constable's other publications in drama were: * the first quarto of Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy, in partnership with stationer Richard Higgenbotham (1619); ** the second quarto of the same play (1622); * Thomas Middleton's A Chaste Maid in Cheapside (1630); * Pathomachia (1630); * James Shirley's Love Tricks, as The School of Compliment (1631); ** a second edition of the same play (1637); * Philip Massinger and Nathan Field's The Fatal Dowry (1632); * William Rowley's A New Wonder, a Woman Never Vexed (1632); * Richard Brome's The Antipodes (1640); * Brome's The Sparagus Garden (1640); * Henry Glapthorne's The Lady's Privilege (1640); * Glapthorne's Wit in a Constable (1640). Constable worked with many London printers on these and other projects, including Richard and Thomas Cotes, Nicholas Okes and his son John Okes, and Elizabeth Allde, among others. Other works Inevitably, Constable also published a wide variety of other literature beyond the drama. He published the second edition of William Vaughan's The Spirit of Detraction in 1630. He issued multiple editions of Thomas Scott's satire Philomythie, or Philomythologie, Wherein Outlandish Birds Beasts and Fishes are Taught to Speak True English Plainly, in 1616 and after; and multiple editions of Henry Peacham the younger's The Complete Gentleman, from 1622 on. He published items of the religious literature that was so common in the era, like Alexander Ross's Three Decades of Divine Meditations (1630). And religious poetry: Richard Braithwaite's The Psalms of David (1638). He published Peacham's Thalia's Banquet in 1620, and his elegy Thestylis Astrata in 1634; and Glapthorne's poem Whitehall in 1643. Constable also was responsible for texts in medicine and anatomy.Elizabeth Lane Furdell, Publishing and Medicine in Early Modern England, Rochester, NY, University of Rochester Press, 2002; p. 53. And Constable also issued works of social criticism and contemporary controversies, like Machiavel's Ghost, as He Lately Appeared to His Dear Sons, the Modern Projectors (1641; attributed to John Taylor the Water Poet). He issued one notable volume in the utopian literature, Samuel Hartlib's A Description of the Famous Kingdom of Macaria (1641) ‚Äì plus a supply of political and legal materials involving the start of the English Civil War and the Commonwealth era.George Knottesford Fortescue/British Library Department of Printed Books, Catalogue of the Pamphlets, Books, Newspapers, and Manuscripts Relating to the Civil War, the Commonwealth, and Restoration, Collected by George Thomason, 1640‚Äì1661, London, British Museum/Longman & Co., 1908; Vol. 1, pp. 3, 8, 11, 15, and ff.

An interesting claim is made in many genealogies that one of Francis's daughters, Anne Constable, married Richard I Lee, an important figure in the colony of Virginia, who was the ancestor of Confederate General, Robert E. Lee.Rootsweb Francis Constable's father When Francis's elder brother Robert was apprenticed in 1607 to their maternal uncle Robert Barker, their father was described as \\"Robert Constable, late of North Pickenham in co.

Francis Constable's grandfather was Robert Constable, and he was a yeoman, a minor land owner and small prosperous farmer. This is further substantiated by records held in The National Archives that show that in 1575 Robert Constable sold a messuage called Frostes in North Pickenham to George ConstableThe National Archives (assumed to be a relative), and that he paid for both of his son's tuition and board at Cambridge. Both Robert Constable and his younger brother Thomas went to school for 4 years before going to University: Robert at Saxthorpe, Norfolkshire, and Thomas at both Norwich and Saxthorpe. Robert Constable spent a year at Pembroke College at Cambridge before joining Gonville and Caius College. His tutor at Gonville and Caius College was his 23-year-old cousin, Simon Canham, the son of Simon Canham (‚àí1584) of Ashill, Norfolkshire (1¬Ω miles from North Pickenham) and his wife Alice (‚àí1603),Campling's East Anglian Pedigrees who had been admitted to Gonville and Caius College a year before Robert Constable after first spending four years at St John's College, Cambridge.White, C.H.E., The East Anglian; or, Notes and queries on subjects connected with the counties of Suffolk, Cambridge, Essex and Norfolk (1885) Francis's father Robert Constable received his Bachelor of Arts in 1577. The Biographical History of Gonville and Caius College, 1349‚Äì1897 further tells us that Francis's father Robert Constable was a lawyer and a barrister as he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in February 1582. It further tells us that the family would have suffered persecution as they were a \\"popish recusant family in 1588\\", refusing to attend services or take communion in the Church of England. There was a statute passed in 1593 that determined penalties against \\"Popish Recusants\\" including fines, property confiscation, and imprisonment. Further the Popish Recusants Act of 1605 forbade Roman Catholics from practising the professions of law and medicine. This would explain why Francis and his brother Robert Constable went into the printing trade of their maternal uncle rather than follow their father into law. There is a record at the Norfolk Record Office for the will of a Thomas Constable of Ashill from the period 1536‚Äì1545.Norfolk Record Office It is possible that this Thomas Constable is Francis's great or greatx2-grandfather, and the father or grandfather of Robert Constable of North Pickenham. Many genealogies claim that Francis Constable is the great-grandson of Thomas Constable M.P. (c.1506-aft.1558) of Great Grimsby, Lincolnshire and his 1st wife Barbara Catherall of Great Grimsby, and the great-grandson of Sir Robert Constable (c.1478‚Äì1537) of Flamburgh (Flamborough), Yorkshire and his wife Jane Ingleby of Ripley, Yorkshire. This, however, cannot be substantiated. Even though it is highly likely that Thomas Constable M.P. of Great Grimsby had a son named Robert after his father, there is no evidence and no reason to believe that this son was Robert Constable of North Pickenham, Francis's grandfather. There are many Constable families in England, and many Robert Constables in that period.

The Canadian supply depot in Somalia was being looted and Arone was suspected of being one of the looters. Master Corporal Clayton Matchee took a lead role in Arone's torture and murder. The teenager's screams were reported to have been heard throughout the camp. Matchee was taken into custody, tried to hang himself, but only succeeded in causing himself irreversible brain damage. Because of this he was deemed unfit to stand trial. Brown, who played a secondary role, was convicted of manslaughter, and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, along with Dismissal with Disgrace from the Canadian Forces. He served one third of his five-year sentence. Brown later published a book in which he presented a case wherein he had been made the scapegoat for the incident and the officers who had not intervened were not brought to justice. An official inquiry in 1997 considered whether mefloquine, an anti-malarial drug that troops were taking, known to trigger psychotic symptoms in sensitive individuals, played a role in Arone's abuse, though the results were inconclusive.

Food items to be cooked are heated to boiling point, and then insulated. Over a period of time, the food items cook by the heat captured in the insulated container. Generally, it takes three times the normal cooking time to cook food in a haybox. History Hayboxes are so called because hay or straw were the commonly used insulators. Pots of food would be brought to a boil and then placed in a box filled with hay or straw. Additional hay or straw would be added around and on top of the pot. The inventor Karl von Drais developed a novel form of haybox in the first part of the 19th century. During World War II, hayboxes were used as a way of conserving rationed cooking fuel. Campers and hikers have used variations of hayboxes for years, heating their food in the morning and then storing the heated pot in a sleeping bag or backpack. In this way a hot meal is available for eating at the end of the day. Commercial designs based on this principle differed only in details of construction, and the kind of insulating material used. Some types were provided with soapstone or iron plates which were heated during the preliminary cooking on the stove and then placed in the fireless cooker either over or under the cooking pot. In these types, a non-flammable insulating material was used. A successful home-made strategy was to take a box so large that the cooking pot when placed in it could be surrounded by a thick layer of non-conducting material, such as hay, excelsior or crumpled paper. A cushion was placed over the pot and a tight-fitting lid was placed over all.  Advantages and disadvantages  Haybox cooking can save vast amounts of fuel, but there is a risk of bacterial growth if the food items are allowed to remain in the danger zone (41‚àí140 ¬∞F or 5‚àí60 ¬∞C) for one or more hours. In order to reduce the risk, food cooked in hayboxes can be reheated to boiling before eating, or a food thermometer can be used.

When the crisis of the American Civil War occurred, she operated in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways. Paraguay expedition of 1858 Western Port ‚Äì a former merchant steamer built at Philadelphia, in 1853 ‚Äì was chartered by the United States Department of the Navy in the autumn of 1858 to participate in an American naval expedition up the Paran√° River to Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. After the vessel had been fitted out as a gunboat, she was commissioned as USS Western Port on 27 October 1858, Commander Thomas T. Hunter in command. Conflict with Paraguay Paraguay Squadron (Harper's Weekly, New York, October 16, 1858). Western Port soon sailed for South American waters and ‚Äì at Montevideo, Uruguay, ‚Äì joined the task force commanded by Flag Officer William Branford Shubrick, which had been assembled to support the negotiations of United States Commissioner to Paraguay, James Butler Bowlin. President of the United States James Buchanan had appointed Bowlin to seek redress for the shelling of the U.S. Navy sidewheel gunboat in 1855, which had resulted in the death of the American ship's helmsman. The Paraguay expedition got underway from Montevideo on 30 December 1858 and ascended the R√≠o de la Plata, the Paran√° River, and the Paraguay River. She arrived off Asunci√≥n on 25 January 1859, and Bowlin went ashore to conduct negotiations which succeeded in winning an apology to the United States and a large indemnity for survivors of the dead helmsman. Bowling also signed a new commercial treaty between the United States and Paraguay. After the conclusion of the negotiations, Western Port returned to the United States and was decommissioned on 28 May 1859. She was purchased by the Navy Department on 6 June 1859 and renamed Wyandotte. As USS Wyandotte After repairs, Wyandotte was recommissioned on 19 September 1859 and assigned to the Home Squadron. She spent much of the next year cruising ‚Äì for the most part in the Caribbean ‚Äì in an effort to suppress the slave trade. Captures slave ship William Landing of a cargo of slaves from the slave ship Williams, after capture by the Wyandotte On 9 May 1860, Wyandotte captured the barque William ‚Äì a slave ship carrying 570 Africans at the time of her capture ‚Äì off the Isle of Pines near the south coast of Cuba. She took her prize to Florida and arrived at Key West, Florida, on 12 May 1860. The ship landed the slaves on 16 May, turned the prize over to a United States Marshall on 22 May, and soon resumed her cruising. Operations at Key West As the threat of secession of the Southern United States grew in the mid-and late autumn of 1860, Wyandotte guarded and reprovisioned United States Government military installations along the United States Gulf Coast. On 16 November 1860, she was ordered to protect Fort Taylor at Key West, Florida, while the steamer watched Fort Jefferson. These actions saved Key West for the Union, permitting its wartime use as the home port of the U.S. Navy's Gulf Blockading Squadron. American Civil War Escape from Pensacola In mid-December 1860, Wyandotte steamed to Pensacola, Florida, and entered the drydock at Pensacola Navy Yard to have her fouled bottom scraped and to receive minor repairs. She was refloated on 9 January 1861 and refused to surrender when Confederate forces took over the navy yard three days later. Instead, she towed the stores ship out to sea. Wyandotte remained in Pensacola Bay, performing valuable observation and communication duty. She transported troops from Fort Barrancas, Florida, to Fort Pickens on 10 February 1861 and regularly patrolled the inner shore of Santa Rosa Island, Florida, to prevent Confederate soldiers from attacking Fort Pickens by land. Reinforcement of Fort Pickens Wyandotte took part in the nighttime reinforcement of Fort Pickens on 12 April 1861, the day the American Civil War began with the Confederate shelling of Fort Sumter in South Carolina. With the outbreak of hostilities, Wyandotte joined the Gulf Blockading Squadron on 17 May 1861. After carrying out patrol and transport assignments, she proceeded to the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, for major repairs, arriving there on 23 August 1861. South Atlantic Blockading Squadron On 5 December 1861, Wyandotte departed New York City bound for Port Royal, South Carolina, and duty with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. From there, she was dispatched to Tybee Island, Georgia, for reconnaissance work on 19 December 1861 and then was transferred to the blockade off Wassaw Sound, Georgia, on 23 February 1862. Wyandotte returned to Port Royal in late April 1862 and proceeded to the blockade off Mosquito Inlet, Florida, on 12 May 1862. She returned to Port Royal in July 1862, and arrived in New York City a second time on 25 July 1862 for extensive repairs at the New York Navy Yard. North Atlantic Blockading Squadron Wyandotte left the navy yard on 1 September 1862 for duty in the Potomac River with the Potomac Flotilla. She was reassigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 7 October 1862, deploying off Fort Monroe, Virginia, as a guard ship. On detail, Wyandotte salvaged valuable supplies from the schooner Marie Banks, wrecked off Cape Henry Light, Virginia, on 10 February 1863. She was repaired at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia, and got underway again on 11 April 1863 to resume blockade duty. However, badly strained, Wyandotte could no longer withstand rolling seas and was condemned as fit for guard duty only on 3 October 1863. She spent the remainder of the war off Norfolk, Virginia. Pensacola Harbor, 1861 Post-war decommissioning Wyandotte was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 3 June 1865 and was sold at auction there on 12 July 1865. She was redocumented for merchant service on 23 September 1865, but was stranded when she ran aground off Duxbury, Massachusetts, on 26 January 1866 and was damaged beyond economical repair.

Traditional subjective Bayesian analysis is based upon fully specified probability distributions, which are very difficult to specify at the necessary level of detail. Bayes linear analysis attempts to solve this problem by developing theory and practise for using partially specified probability models. Bayes linear in its current form has been primarily developed by Michael Goldstein. Mathematically and philosophically it extends Bruno de Finetti's Operational Subjective approach to probability and statistics. Motivation Consider first a traditional Bayesian Analysis where you expect to shortly know D and you would like to know more about some other observable B. In the traditional Bayesian approach it is required that every possible outcome is enumerated i.e. every possible outcome is the cross product of the partition of a set of B and D. If represented on a computer where B requires n bits and D m bits then the number of states required is 2^{n+m}. The first step to such an analysis is to determine a persons subjective probabilities e.g. by asking about their betting behaviour for each of these outcomes. When we learn D conditional probabilities for B are determined by the application of Bayes' rule. Practitioners of subjective Bayesian statistics routinely analyse datasets where the size of this set is large enough that subjective probabilities cannot be meaningfully determined for every element of D √ó B. This is normally accomplished by assuming exchangeability and then the use of parameterized models with prior distributions over parameters and appealing to the de Finetti's theorem to justify that this produces valid operational subjective probabilities over D √ó B. The difficulty with such an approach is that the validity of the statistical analysis requires that the subjective probabilities are a good representation of an individual's beliefs however this method results in a very precise specification over D √ó B and it is often difficult to articulate what it would mean to adopt these belief specifications. In contrast to the traditional Bayesian paradigm Bayes linear statistics following de Finetti uses Prevision or subjective expectation as a primitive, probability is then defined as the expectation of an indicator variable. Instead of specifying a subjective probability for every element in the partition D √ó B the analyst specifies subjective expectations for just a few quantities that they are interested in or feel knowledgeable about. Then instead of conditioning an adjusted expectation is computed by a rule that is a generalization of Bayes' rule that is based upon expectation. The use of the word linear in the title refers to de Finetti's arguments that probability theory is a linear theory (de Finetti argued against the more common measure theory approach). Example In Bayes linear statistics, the probability model is only partially specified, and it is not possible to calculate conditional probability by Bayes' rule. Instead Bayes linear suggests the calculation of an Adjusted Expectation. To conduct a Bayes linear analysis it is necessary to identify some values that you expect to know shortly by making measurements D and some future value which you would like to know B. Here D refers to a vector containing data and B to a vector containing quantities you would like to predict. For the following example B and D are taken to be two-dimensional vectors i.e. :B = (Y_1,Y_2),~ D = (X_1,X_2). In order to specify a Bayes linear model it is necessary to supply expectations for the vectors B and D, and to also specify the correlation between each component of B and each component of D. For example the expectations are specified as: : E(Y_1)=5,~E(Y_2)=3,~E(X_1)=5,~E(X_2)=3 and the covariance matrix is specified as : : \\\\begin{array}{ccccc} & X_1 & X_2 & Y_1 & Y_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline X_1 & 1 & u & \\\\gamma & \\\\gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ X_2 & u & 1 & \\\\gamma & \\\\gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ Y_1 & \\\\gamma & \\\\gamma & 1 & v \\\\\\\\\\\\ Y_2 & \\\\gamma & \\\\gamma & v & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}. The repetition in this matrix, has some interesting implications to be discussed shortly. An adjusted expectation is a linear estimator of the form : c_0 + c_1X_1 + c_2X_2 where c_0, c_1 and c_2 are chosen to minimise the prior expected loss for the observations i.e. Y_1, Y_2 in this case. That is for Y_1 : E([Y_1 - c_0 - c_1X_1 - c_2X_2]^2)\\\\, where : c_0, c_1, c_2\\\\, are chosen in order to minimise the prior expected loss in estimating Y_1 In general the adjusted expectation is calculated with : E_D(X) = \\\\sum^k_{i=0} h_iD_i . Setting h_0, \\\\dots, h_k to minimise : E\\\\left(\\\\left[X-\\\\sum^k_{i=0}h_iD_i\\\\right]^2\\\\right). From a proof provided in (Goldstein and Wooff 2007) it can be shown that: : E_D(X) = E(X) + \\\\mathrm{Cov}(X,D)\\\\mathrm{Var}(D)^{-1}(D-E(D)) . \\\\, For the case where is not invertible the Moore‚ÄìPenrose pseudoinverse should be used instead. Furthermore, the adjusted variance of the variable after observing the data is given by : \\\\mathrm{Var}_D(X) = \\\\mathrm{Var}(X) - \\\\mathrm{Cov}(X,D)\\\\mathrm{Var}(D)^{-1}\\\\mathrm{Cov}(D,X).

A Wilberforce pendulum, invented by British physicist Lionel Robert Wilberforce around 1896, consists of a mass suspended by a long helical spring and free to turn on its vertical axis, twisting the spring. It is an example of a coupled mechanical oscillator, often used as a demonstration in physics education. The mass can both bob up and down on the spring, and rotate back and forth about its vertical axis with torsional vibrations. When correctly adjusted and set in motion, it exhibits a curious motion in which periods of purely rotational oscillation gradually alternate with periods of purely up and down oscillation. The energy stored in the device shifts slowly back and forth between the translational 'up and down' oscillation mode and the torsional 'clockwise and counterclockwise' oscillation mode, until the motion eventually dies away. Despite the name, in normal operation it does not swing back and forth as ordinary pendulums do. The mass usually has opposing pairs of radial 'arms' sticking out horizontally, threaded with small weights that can be screwed in or out to adjust the moment of inertia to 'tune' the torsional vibration period. Explanation Wilberforce pendulum, 1908 The device's intriguing behavior is caused by a slight coupling between the two motions or degrees of freedom, due to the geometry of the spring. When the weight is moving up and down, each downward excursion of the spring causes it to unwind slightly, giving the weight a slight twist. When the weight moves up, it causes the spring to wind slightly tighter, giving the weight a slight twist in the other direction. So when the weight is moving up and down, each oscillation gives a slight alternating rotational torque to the weight. In other words, during each oscillation some of the energy in the translational mode leaks into the rotational mode. Slowly the up and down movement gets less, and the rotational movement gets greater, until the weight is just rotating and not bobbing. Similarly, when the weight is rotating back and forth, each twist of the weight in the direction that unwinds the spring also reduces the spring tension slightly, causing the weight to sag a little lower. Conversely, each twist of the weight in the direction of winding the spring tighter causes the tension to increase, pulling the weight up slightly. So each oscillation of the weight back and forth causes it to bob up and down more, until all the energy is transferred back from the rotational mode into the translational mode and it is just bobbing up and down, not rotating. Alternation or 'beat' frequency The frequency at which the two modes alternate is equal to the difference between the oscillation frequencies of the modes. The closer in frequency the two motions are, the slower will be the alternation between them. This behavior, common to all coupled oscillators, is analogous to the phenomenon of beats in musical instruments, in which two tones combine to produce a 'beat' tone at the difference between their frequencies. For example, if the pendulum bobs up and down at a rate of fT = 4 Hz, and rotates back and forth about its axis at a rate of fR = 4.1 Hz, the alternation rate falt will be: f_{\\\\rm alt} = f_R - f_T = 0.1\\\\; \\\\mathrm{Hz} T_{\\\\rm alt} = 1 / f_{\\\\rm alt} = 10\\\\; \\\\mathrm{s} So the motion will change from rotational to translational in 5 seconds and then back to rotational in the next 5 seconds. The pendulum is usually adjusted by moving the moment of inertia adjustment weights in or out equal amounts on each side, until the rotational frequency is close to the translational frequency, so the alternation period will be slow enough to allow the change between the two modes to be clearly seen.

Harvard, 1996, p. 152. Early life Chanler was born on April 29, 1902 in Newport, Rhode Island. He was a son of Major Winthrop Astor Chanler and Margaret Ward (n√©e Terry) Chanler, an author and musician. Theodore's godfather was President Theodore Roosevelt, who attended his christening in Newport in 1902. Though born in Newport, his family shortly moved to Geneseo, New York where he grew up at the family estate, Sweet Briar Farms. His paternal grandparents were Margaret Astor (n√©e Ward) Chanler (1838‚Äì1875), a member of the Astor family, and John Winthrop Chanler (1826‚Äì1877), a U.S. Representative from New York. His maternal grandparents were Louisa (n√©e Ward) Crawford Terry and artist Luther Terry (d. 1900). His grandmother was a half-sister of F. Marion Crawford and a niece of Julia Ward Howe. Chanler studied piano while a youngster in Boston, and then studied piano under Buhling and counterpoint under Goetschius at the Institute of Musical Art in New York City. From 1920 to 1923, he studied at the Cleveland Institute of Music, and between 1924 and 1927 in Europe (Oxford, then Paris under Nadia Boulanger). Career He became a music critic for the Boston Herald in 1934, and taught in Massachusetts in the 1940s and 1950s. He was also a regular contributor to the American magazine Modern Music. Chanler's best-known works are his songs, which number about 50. He also composed a ballet, an opera (The Pot of Fat, 1955), choral pieces, works for chamber ensemble, and piano solo pieces. In 1940, he was awarded the League of Composers Town Hall Award for his song cycle, \\"Four Rhymes from Peacock Pie\\" and, in 1944, was the recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship. Teaching career From 1945 to 1947, he was on the faculty of the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. He also taught at the Longy School of Music of Bard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Personal life In Paris in 1931, Chanler was married to Maria (n√©e De Acosta) Sargent (1880‚Äì1970), the daughter of Ricardo de Acosta.

Arch, P. Eng, PP-FRAIC, PP-RCA, FAIA (hon) (20 December 1929 ‚Äì 9 November 2007) was an American-born Canadian architect who designed several landmark Toronto buildings. Early life Born in Baltimore, Maryland, DuBois earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (cum laude) at Tufts University in 1951, and served in Europe and Asia with the U.S. Navy from 1951‚Äì54. DuBois retired as Lieutenant, Junior Grade and commander of the minesweeper USS Kite with the Korea Service Star and United Nations Battle Star. Career Uncertain about a career in engineering, DuBois attended an American Institute of Architects (AIA) conference in Boston, and was inspired to attend the Harvard Graduate School of Design, graduating in 1958. In his final year, he entered the Toronto City Hall design competition with three other student collaborators. Selected as one of 8 semi-finalists from a field of 510 entrants, he moved to Toronto to work on the second round and, although his design was not ultimately selected, soon relocated permanently. DuBois worked briefly for John B. Parkin and Associates (1958‚Äì59), then joined Robert Fairfield Associates in 1960, which was renamed Fairfield+DuBois when he became a partner in 1962. The firm went through several name changes as partners joined and left, finally becoming The DuBois Plumb Partnership after partnering with Helga Plumb in 1979 until their retirement in 2001. His first major project, begun in 1959, was the combined residence and teaching facility of New College, University of Toronto, with a curved interior courtyard inside a rectilinear facade.McClelland, page 100 It was well received, winning a local architectural design award after completion of phase II, and is considered one of the finest buildings on the campus. Having been told soon after arriving in Toronto that exposed concrete \\"just won't work because of our climate\\", DuBois determined to prove otherwise in his second significant project, the Central Technical School Arts Centre.McClelland, page 94 Occupied in 1963, it was an internationally recognized success, establishing his reputation designing academic buildings.McClelland, page 95, photo of New York Times article, July 11, 1965. The Expo 67 Ontario pavilion Probably his most- photographed building was the Ontario pavilion at Expo 67, an irregular tent- like structure made of computer-designed fabric stretched across a steel framework. A little too imaginative for some, who claimed the model \\"looks vaguely like a bat strangling under a white sheet\\" or \\"a model of a sort of tent city or a mess of paper triangles or mentally disarranged envelopes\\", it was greatly admired by almost everyone who actually saw it. Dubois wanted a natural landscaping for the pavilion and worked with landscape architect Dick Strong on a design featuring massive granite blocks, of differing size.McClelland, pages 107-109 DuBois went on to design many institutional buildings, including a large portion of Lakehead University, and win numerous awards. Generally in the modern style, he tempered the brutalism of Le Corbusier, with inspiration from Alvar Aalto, Louis Kahn and Frank Lloyd Wright.Jackson, page 247McClelland, pp. 100, 106 To these influences, he personally added sensitivity to the application and environment, building on a human scale, and the use of interior spaces that are useful year- round.Jackson, page 247, \\"The work of DuBois...has been based on the accepted credo of the early modern movement, which stressed rational planning, structural order, and a straightforward attitude to design.\\" His only significant residential project, The Oaklands condominium and townhouse development in Toronto, is an excellent example. Earning a Governor General's Award in 1983, the citation credited \\"Scale with surroundings well conceived; calm of the complex's interior street; considerable value obtained with limited budget. As his career matured, DuBois contributed a great deal of time to foster the profession of architecture. His energetic service to the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada earned him the presidency of the society from 1982‚Äì83, and he also served as president of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts from 1988‚Äì91. His last public appearance was at the launch of the book Concrete Toronto on November 1, 2007, only a few days before his unexpected death. Major awards DuBois received numerous honours and awards for his work, the most notable being: * Massey Medal (1964) for Central Technical School Arts Centre. * Massey Medal (1967) for ECE Group Office building, Don Mills * Low Energy Building Design Award of Excellence (1980), for the Joseph Shepard Building * Governor General's Medal in Architecture (1983), for The Oaklands Condominium and Housing Project.

Rodarte has received a number of fashion industry awards since the line's inception in 2005. In addition to their main fashion line, the sisters have also collaborated with Gap and Target on limited edition pieces. History In 2002 after leaving college, the Mulleavy sisters returned home to Aptos, California, where they spent the intervening years saving up USD$16,500 in order to create a capsule collection, with Laura working as a waitress and Kate selling off a collection of rare records. The label Rodarte is the original Spanish pronunciation and spelling of their mother's maiden name, Rodart. After their initial collection of just ten pieces (which included seven dresses and two coats), the Mulleavys traveled to New York City and appeared on the cover of a February 2005 issue of Women's Wear Daily. This led to their meeting with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who personally flew to Los Angeles to meet the sisters. The Mulleavy sisters garnered notoriety early on for their meticulous approach to clothing, with one chiffon dress from their 2006 collection taking over 150 hours to complete. In the spring of 2007, the label released a line of limited-edition exclusive shirts in collaboration with Gap. In December 2009, the label released another separate line of limited-edition pieces in collaboration with Target. Style and influences They both credit their West Coast upbringing as a major source of inspiration for their collections. The natural American landscape is of particular inspiration to the sisters. Rodarte's aesthetic influences have evolved since the label's establishment, with their evolution described in 2010 as \\"darker, their clothing riskier, more deconstructed, punk, and gothic. Each collection has been stranger than the last, influenced by anime and horror films, and elements of S & M culture.\\" In an article published by The New Yorker, the label was described as \\"the fashion equivalent of a Basquiat. People in the know really love it, but to everyone else it‚Äôs inscrutable or a little bit ugly.\\" Museums and exhibitions Backstage at Fall 2008 Rodarte fashion show Rodarte is in the permanent collections of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Fashion Institute of Technology Museum in New York, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

In February 2010, Rodarte had their first solo-exhibition, at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum (the design branch of the Smithsonian Institution). In May 2011, Rodarte contributed artworks to the Los Angeles County Museum of Arts Cell Phone Stories project. Their contribution included sketches based on artworks held in the LACMA's permanent collection. In February 2011, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles opened Rodarte: States of Matter, the first West Coast museum exhibition of the Rodarte's fashion and costume designs from Fall 2008, Spring 2010, Fall 2010, and pieces from the film Black Swan. In 2011, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) acquired the Rodarte Spring 2012 couture collection. LACMA displayed the renaissance-inspired clothing in their Italian renaissance gallery, alongside Italian renaissance artworks, in the exhibition Rodarte: Fra Angelico Collection from December 2011 to February 2012. Accolades Rodarte was nominated for its first CFDA Swarovski Emerging Womenswear Designer award in June 2006, followed by another nomination in 2007. Rodarte was awarded the CFDA Swarovski Emerging Womenswear Designer in June 2008. Rodarte was then awarded the CFDA Womenswear Designer of the Year Award in June 2009. In Fall 2006, Rodarte was awarded runner-up in the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund competition. In the summer of 2008, Rodarte was selected as a finalist in the ANDAM competition. On November 13, 2008, The Mulleavy sisters won The Swiss Textiles Award in Zurich Switzerland, worth 100,000 euros.

It represents a feature of the Superior craton, an ancient and stable part of the Earth's lithosphere that forms the core of the North American continent and Canadian Shield. The belt is composed of metamorphosed volcanic rocks that range in composition from basalt to rhyolite. These form the east-northeast trend of the belt and are overlain by metamorphosed sedimentary rocks. They were created during several volcanic episodes involving a variety of eruptive styles ranging from passive lava eruptions to viscous explosive eruptions. Part of the Canadian Shield, the TGB contains some of the oldest known rocks on Earth. The belt is made up of a number of geologic features such as batholiths, stocks, dikes, volcanic complexes, layered intrusions and deformation zones. These are situated in several geographical townships in the municipality of Temagami, including Chambers, Strathy, Strathcona, Briggs and possibly Best. Geology Geologists assume that greenstone belts were formed by many geological processes, such as tectonism, magmatism, metamorphism and sedimentation. They are important economically for large metal deposits, and for the insight they provide into crustal evolution and the tectonics of the early Earth. The TGB is wide and long. It contains the southernmost remnants of Archean intrusive and supracrustal rocks in Eastern Ontario, as well as some of the most ancient felsic magmatic events in this section of the Superior craton. Uranium-lead dating has established that the Iceland Lake Pluton, as well as an adjacent rhyolitic lava flow, is about 2,736 million years old. Therefore, at least some intrusions were likely formed during the first volcanic phases in the belt and may have been conduits for volcanic eruptions. The variety of volcanic deposits and intrusions in the TGB indicates that magmatic activity played a significant part in its formation. Pillow lava is found throughout the belt, indicating lava erupted underwater. Its pyroclastic deposits are remnants of explosive volcanism. The oldest exposed rocks within the belt are fine to medium-grained basalts and andesites. Lava flow units range in thickness from to . Mafic agglomerate and breccia are relatively abundant, being either massive and undeformed, or sheared. Dacitic lava flows or tuffs overlie these metamorphosed volcanic rocks along with intermediate volcanic breccias, and are overlain by rhyolite lava flows and tuffs. Acidic lava flow units range in thickness from to and are common in the Vermilion Lake and Link Lake areas. The felsic tuffs are normally altered and sheared. The most recent intrusive activity in the TGB was the formation of a rhyolite porphyry dike million years ago. This age correlates well with the 2675‚Äì2700 million year old intrusions throughout the Abitibi Subprovince, but the 2736 million year old magmatic events in the TGB are older than the closest exposed portion of the Abitibi Subprovince, about north of Kirkland Lake. Along with nearby granitic intrusions, the TGB is bounded by layers of rock comprising the Huronian Supergroup. Strathy Township is dominated by metamorphosed volcanic rocks of the northeastern portion of the belt. It is approximately north of the Grenville Front Tectonic Zone. The volcanic rocks possibly total as much as thick. However, portions of the sequence might have been repeatedly sheared by one or several local fault zones. Every large volcanic event is capped by metamorphosed sedimentary rocks and/or iron formations. The metamorphosed sedimentary units range in thickness from to and consist of laminated slate and greywacke with or without volcanogenic tuffs. The iron formations are composed of alternate layers of magnetite, white quartzite, jasper, grey cherty quartz, and/or tremolite- chlorite tuff. They are intruded by sills composed of medium-grained, white- weathering, quartz diorite that range in thickness from to . These rocks are similar to the coarse thicker parts of lava flows, but are interpreted to be partly intrusive, likely conduits that produced mafic volcanism. Intrusions A layered intrusion composed of diorite, pyroxenite, gabbro and anorthositic gabbro has been found in northwestern Strathy Township. Pyrrhotite is common in associated pyroclastic rock. Several northeast- trending shear zones less than wide intersect the edifice, extending along the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. This layered intrusion might be similar in age to the Kanichee layered intrusive complex, and may represent a magma chamber that was the source of tholeiitic volcanic activity. The Kanichee layered intrusive complex, also known as the Kanichee Intrusion and Ajax Intrusion, is the most voluminous mafic-ultramafic body in metamorphosed felsic and mafic volcanic rocks of the northern TGB. It is an oval-shaped layered intrusion that was formed during five phases of magmatic activity. A series of south-southeast dipping cyclic magmatic layers make up the intrusion, similar to those of the surrounding metamorphosed volcanic rocks, indicating that the rocks of the intrusion were formed horizontally and likely close to the surface. Numerous magmatic events may have breached the surface to produce volcanic eruptions. The overall structure of the intrusion indicates it is cylindrical in shape and has a long axis plunging to the southeast at a somewhat steep angle. Its fairly steep angled axis was formed by at least one period of deformation that similarly folded and deformed the surrounding volcanic rocks. An intrusion of light-coloured diorite lies at the northern end of the Tetapaga Syncline, along the Milne-Sherman Road. Its colouration is from weathering of plagioclase, which comprises more than 50% of the intrusive rock. Several east-trending high-strain zones related to the Link Lake Deformation Zone, less than wide, are found in the intrusion, indicating that it formed at least before the last increment of strain along the Link Lake Deformation Zone. The dioritic intrusion might be the remains of a magma chamber that was the product of calc-alkaline feldspar-phyric felsic volcanism, the erupted products of which are mostly located in the Sherman Mine area. A dike intruding igneous rock exposed along Highway 11 immediately north of Temagami North. This dike is about wide At least three large granitoid intrusions penetrate the TGB. The Spawning Lake Stock in Briggs and Chambers townships contains megacrysts that reach to in diameter. It shears through the nearby fold axis of the Tetapaga Syncline, but remains undeformed by the western expression of the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. To the north and northeast, the massive Chambers-Strathy Batholith was formed during one magmatic event. It consists of intrusive rocks ranging from pink to grey quartz monzonite to granodiorite and intrudes metamorphosed volcanic rocks of the TGB. The Iceland Lake Pluton, situated in Strathcona and Briggs townships, consists of a complex series of chlorite trondhjemite, hornblende quartz diorite and hornblende trondhjemite magmas that were emplaced during more than one magmatic event. The trend of metamorphosed volcanic rocks in Briggs and Strathcona townships is parallel to the intrusion contact. A planar fabric, attributed to the earliest deformation of the TGB, exists in the outer margin of the intrusion. Intrusive dikes composed of quartz and feldspar- quartz porphyry are widespread in Strathy Township. All dike types were placed in the Earth's crust during the formation of the TGB. At least some of these dikes may have been subvolcanic feeders that produced known calc-alkalic felsic volcanic events in the belt. Many pyroxenite dikes less than wide intrude every geologic formation in the township. A pyroxenite dike east of Highway 11 extends roughly to the north-northwest while two others, north of Arsenic Lake, extend to the east. This includes a dike exposed along the Kanichee Mine Road in Temagami North, where it intrudes the large granitic Chambers-Strathy Batholith. A series of northwest-trending dikes composed of diabase may represent extensions of the 1,250 million year old Sudbury dike swarm. This dike swarm is older than the Lake Wanapitei impact crater but younger than the meteorite impact that created the large Sudbury Basin crater about 1,850 million years ago. Therefore, the TGB predates these two impact craters, the Sudbury crater of which is the seconed largest known impact crater on Earth. Felsic volcanic vents Volcanic vents composed of felsic rocks are thought to have been located at the iron-bearing Sherman Mine, the former Temagami garbage dump and adjacent to the Milne Townsite. Remnants of a large volcanic vent are present west of Sherman Mine, including the existence of two felsic lava flows that outcrop between Link Lake and Turtle Lake. The aspect of the most extensive felsic lava flow indicates that the volcanic vent they erupted from was adjacent to the western portion of Link Lake. Additionally, differentiation of facies and directions in which the lava traveled exist in course grained, resedimented conglomerate. This suggests that a more prominent structure, perhaps evidence of a prehistoric volcano, existed west of Link Lake. Also, coarsest felsic volcanic fragments occur in feldspar-phyric pyroclastic deposits exposed on the Sherman Mine property, suggesting the approximate location of a volcanic vent. Just north of the Milne Townsite lies a minor felsic volcanic vent exposed along the Milne- Sherman Road. A quartz porphyry has intruded mafic and rhyolitic lava flows and a dike of diorite. In the middle of the intrusive body, the grain size of quartz phenocrysts averages roughly , but become smaller towards the edge of the intrusion. Broken fragmental rocks, interpreted to be carapace breccia, are exposed along the western margin of the intrusion. Exposed near a minor felsic lava dome is a fine grained, quartz-phyric felsic rock that may represent a rhyolite lava flow. An igneous body, interpreted to be a subvolcanic intrusion, is exposed approximately to the northwest and might have formed during the same magmatic event as the felsic dome. Exposed along the Sherman Mine railroad west of the former Milne sawmill lumber yard is a porphyritic body composed of quartz-feldspar. It is unknown if this igneous rock is a rhyolitic lava flow or an intrusion. Several north-trending felsic dikes, composed mainly of feldspar and quartz-feldspar, are located north of the former Temagami garbage dump. These dikes are not known to extend across the Link Lake Deformation Zone, suggesting that they might represent the feeders of a minor volcanic vent, manifest now by felsic lava flows. Because certain lithologies can be correlated through the Link Lake Deformation Zone, it is unlikely that the lack of felsic dikes south of the former town dump area is an expression of displacement along the deformation zone. Volcanic complexes Surface of a weathered pillow lava formation west of the Ontario Northland Railway. This is one of the several pillow lava outcrops throughout the Temagami Greenstone Belt The TGB consists of two large volcanic sequences that were formed during several phases of volcanic activity. These two sequences, known as the Older and Younger volcanic complexes, consist of volcanic rocks ranging in composition from felsic to mafic. The Older Volcanic Complex is composed mainly of felsic lava flows and pyroclastic deposits with smaller amounts of mafic volcanic rocks. It underlies a large portion of northwestern Strathy Township and is penetrated by mafic intrusions, although the Kanichee Intrusion consists of peridotite and pyroxenite, which are ultramafic rocks. Just to the southeast, the Younger Volcanic Complex consists mainly of mafic volcanic rocks that form four geologic formations. The Arsenic Lake Formation is composed of dark green, iron-rich, massive and pillowed tholeiitic basalts. Throughout the Arsenic Lake Formation are feldspar-phyric basaltic lava flows. This type of basalt contains tabular feldspar phenocrysts that range up to in cross section. Both pillowed and massive lava flows have been known to contain coarse feldspar. Coarse feldspar-bearing, iron tholeiitic basalts are more common east of Highway 11. A number of volcanic rocks comprise the Link Lake Formation, such as feldspar-phyric, calc-alkaline basalt and andesite lava flows and less abundant quartz and quartz-feldspar- phyric felsic lava flows. Feldspar-phyric basalt lava flows are normally pillowed. Pyroclastic deposits, quartz-phyric and feldspar-felsic rocks are also present. The largest of the less common felsic lava flows is located between Link Lake and Turtle Lake. It is long and less than thick. The thickest portion of this lava flow or dome is located at the western end of Link Lake, where it is likely associated with a volcanic vent. The bulk of felsic rock in the Link Lake Formation occurs as subaqueous pyroclastic flow deposits. Subearial pyroclastics are normally quartz-phyric and range up to in crosssection. Dark green subearial pyroclastics composed of chlorite and sericite are uncommon and have sustained preferential compression in response to shear throughout the Link Lake Deformation Zone. These dark compressed pyroclastics have been interpreted to be pumice. Some of the subsequence pyroclastic deposits contain fragments of pyrite and quartz, suggesting that discharged sulfide hydrothermal activity took place throughout the volcanic source area. Resedimented felsic, epiclastic and turbiditic sediments compose the Turtle Lake Formation. The base of this formation consists of a heterolithic, volcaniclastic, matrix-supported conglomerate unit that overlies felsic lava flows and pillowed, calc-alkaline basalts of the Link Lake Formation. Many rounded to subangular felsic and mafic volcanic fragments are known to occur in the unit, as well as rare quartz vein fragments and one fragment of white chert. The conglomerate unit passes laterally and vertically into thin bedded deposits. These thin bedded deposits are interpreted to be turbidites that originated from a felsic volcanic vent at the western end of Link Lake. Many dark green, highly vesicular, iron-rich tholeiitic basalts occur in the Turtle Lake Formation, and are interbedded with thin-bedded wackes on the southern limb of the Tetapaga Syncline. The basalts are best exposed along the south shore of Turtle Lake. In some cases, the basalt vesicles are over in diameter and are now filled by white quartz. A series of dark green, massive and pillowed iron-rich tholeiitic basalt lava flows compose an unnamed upper volcanic formation of the Younger Volcanic Complex. It is situated in the core of the Tetapaga Syncline. Not much is known about this volcanic formation because only a small portion of it remains exposed in western Strathy Township. Deformation zones Lakes, volcanic complexes and deformation zones of Strathy Township. Also shown are portions of the massive Chambers-Strathy Batholith Many north-trending shear zones intersect iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. These zones range in width from less than up to , and might maintain a larger area of weakness that was tectonically active over the past billion years. Evidence for early tectonism, likely related to volcanic activity, include the greater density of felsic dikes concentrated immediately around these zones. An example is the north-south trending Big Dan Shear Zone situated near the former garbage dump of Temagami. The felsic dikes near this zone are interpreted to represent a subvolcanic feeder system to the overlying felsic volcanic rocks. It is probable that the dikes maintained a former zone of weakness now demonstrated by the shear zones. Renewed tectonic activity along the Big Dan Shear Zone is manifested by offset of clastic sediments east of the Ontario Northland Railway. This phase of tectonic activity displaced felsic dikes north of the exposed part of this shear zone. However, considerable displacement of the dikes at this location is unknown. The most recent phase of tectonic activity along the Big Dan Shear Zone resulted in the displacement of a Proterozoic dike composed of diabase, which intersects the zone. A similar abundance of felsic dikes are adjacent to Arsenic Lake just west of Highway 11, indicating similar repetitive tectonism also occurred along that structural zone. Therefore, the north-trending shear zones may have been active for at least a billion years. An S-shaped fold in banded iron formation exposed along Highway 11 just north of the town of Temagami Extending from Net Lake to Vermilion Lake lies a northeast-southwest trending high strain zone known as the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. Because geologic mapping has not been done comprehensively throughout this zone, its exact width is unknown. The expression of this deformation zone is clearly identifiable by the intense change in volcanic rocks of the TGB. Volcanic units comprising the northwestern portion of the shear zone have shifted to the northeast while the volcanic rocks comprising its southeastern portion have shifted to the southwest. Along the northeastern arm of Lake Temagami in Strathcona Township lies the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone. This northeast-trending shear zone has not been studied in detail, but casual studies of many islands along the northeastern arm of Lake Temagami have shown that there is severe foliation and minor ferroan carbonate across an area about wide. The Link Lake Deformation Zone, also known as the Link Lake Shear Zone, is an area of deformation wide and over long in Strathy Township. It extends through Link Lake to east of Highway 11, but it is uncertain whether it extends west of Link Lake because no expression of it has been found in the Sherman Mine area. Therefore, the Link Lake Shear Zone might be a northern extension of the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone further south. Strain intensity of the Link Lake Shear Zone is diverse. Generally, the greatest strain intensity is throughout pyroclastic rocks. Extending from the western boundary of central Chambers Township through Tasse Lake to the east is the Tasse Lake Deformation Zone. This deformation zone is roughly long and at least wide. It is uncertain if this deformation zone extends east of Tasse Lake. Rock alteration A vertical quartz vein exposed in a trench at Beanland Mine. This vein is about wide Many forms of rock alteration can be seen in the TGB. Its overall structure has attained greenschist grade metamorphism, even though amphibolite grade metamorphism surrounds the Chambers-Strathy Batholith. The metamorphism that creates greenschist is minimal in contrast to that which creates rocks such as gneiss. Other rock alterations include small veins of quartz and epidote, vesicles filled with quartz, calcite and chlorite, extensive replacement of volcanic rock by silica or calcite, and calcite precipitation in extension fractures. Outcrops of silicified mafic pillow lava are found along and west of the Ontario Northland Railway, east of the Big Dan Shear Zone and adjacent to Outlet Bay and Boot Bay of Net Lake. This form of alteration occurs in deformation zones and is the product of low temperature seawater alteration. Volcanic rock replaced by carbonate is commonly found in the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone, the Link Lake Shear Zone and in the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. Within the high strain zones, carbonate is also manifest as wide veins that have been traced along strike for more than . Basalt has been replaced by calcite in a restricted area just north of the Temagami's former garbage dump. Although developed adjacent to the Link Lake Shear Zone, rocks within and just outside the calcite alteration zone do not normally contain significant foliation. Thus, if the calcite alteration zone was located within the Link Lake Shear Zone, it did not form inside the zone of the highest strain. Mineralization The TGB contains massive banded iron formations and several precious metal and base metal deposits. The banded iron formations range from to to more than thick. Remnants of volcanic vents are an important locator for mineral potential in the Temagami belt because they are adjacent to rocks that contain certain types of mineralization. At the Link Lake Formation, good evidence for copper-zinc massive sulfide deposits has been discovered in associated volcanic rocks. Some gold mineralization may also be associated with volcanic vents. Studies of greenstone terranes in the Superior craton have shown that large gold deposits are associated with regional deformation zones. Therefore, the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone, the Link Lake Shear Zone and the Net Lake- Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone are obvious high potential areas. A number of scattered pyrite deposits can be found throughout the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone. The high frequency of gold mineralization in and near the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone suggests that this deformation zone may very well also contain gold deposits; at least 11 have been discovered within a length of the deformation zone. The gold deposits are found in many rock types, indicating a stronger gold-bearing system with the potential of larger gold deposits. A number of gold-pyrite deposits exist in felsic volcanic rocks overlying the Older Volcanic Complex, near and on the northwestern part of the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. These deposits were likely formed during the creation of the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. At the Younger Volcanic Complex, gold exists in quartz veins containing base metal sulfides. It is also known to exist in pyrite associated with deformed magnetite-rich iron formations, sericitized and carbonatized felsic volcanic rock, quartz-pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-pentlandite-pyrite zones within deformation zones and in north-trending, chloritized shear zones containing arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, pyrite and chalcopyrite. Samples of pyrite in quartz obtained from a wide quartz vein at Beanland Mine A variety of iron, copper, arsenic and zinc ores such as arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, pyrite and chalcopyrite with sphalerite, are present as small veins and in quartz veins throughout north-trending shear zones that cut the iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. Dikes composed of quartz- feldspar porphyry run parallel to or lie within the shear zones and are cut by the mineralization. Chalcopyrite occupies later fractures which intersect massive arsenopyrite. Sparse quartz veins normally exist in or adjacent to the arsenopyrite-rich zones. Several northeast-trending deformation zones intersect pyroxenite of a mafic sill in northwest Strathy Township. Within these high-strain zones quartz veins normally contain chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite with exsolved pentlandite and traces of sphalerite and galena. Chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and pentlandite are deposited throughout shear zones which lack quartz veining. These zones are not known to contain large amounts of gold, although investigations are incomplete. It is also unknown if platinum group metals (which include platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium) exist in these zones because no searches for platinum group elements have been undertaken. Gold and copper values occupy a northeast-trending iron formation within the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. This mineralization is only known to exist southeast of Cooke Lake and immediately south of Net Lake. A unit of chert, magnetite and pyrrhotite outcrops along the southwest shore of Net Lake at Temagami North. Pyrrhotite, the most common sulfide mineral, occurs as small veins and disseminations. Small amounts of pyrite, sphalerite and exsolved pentlandite and chalcopyrite are present with the pyrrhotite. The main exposure lies immediately south of the Kanichee Mine Road, which branches off Highway 11. Minor gold and copper values constitute this zone. This sulfide-bearing unit is located within felsic volcanic rocks of the Older Volcanic Complex and is capped by large, dark green, iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. It has been interpreted that the sulfide zone represents a volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit based on the structure of the sulfide zone and the associated rock types. These ore deposits are created by volcanic-associated hydrothermal events in submarine environments. However, there is evidence that the sulfide mineralization does not have a volcanogenic origin. An unusual feature of this sulfide deposit is the large degree of magnetite at the actual showing. Studies have shown that the chert-magnetite iron formations in the West and North Pits of Sherman Mine extend under and along a series of small lakes from Vermilion Lake to Net Lake. These iron formations are located at roughly the same stratigraphic position as the magnetite-bearing iron formation on the southwestern shore of Net Lake. A northwest-trending cross fault is accompanied by drag folding of a chert- magnetite iron formation unit southeast of Cooke Lake. Also exposed in this area is a dark yellow wide quartz vein composed of pyrite that cross cuts the iron formation at the northeastern end. This west-northwest trending quartz vein is about long. Banded iron formation in the North Pit area of Sherman Mine, showing the red lateral lines of jasper and grey lateral lines of magnetite typical of Neoarchean (2,800‚Äì2,500 million year old) banded iron formations Layered chert-magnetite and lesser chert-pyrite-pyrrhotite iron formations are located at the base of the Arsenic Lake Formation. Former drilling near Vermilion Lake and spatial relationships observed on the surface, suggest that the sulfide-rich iron formation lies up to stratigraphically under the oxide facies iron formation. Iron production from the West and North Pits of Sherman Mine came from this chert-magnetite iron formation unit while chert-magnetite iron formations at the South and East Pits compose the Turtle Lake Formation. The South and East Pit iron formations reach thicknesses of and overlie a thinly bedded turbidite package on the southern limb of the Tetapaga Syncline. A white palladium mercury telluride mineral known as temagamite was discovered in 1973 on Temagami Island in Lake Temagami. It is present as microscopic inclusions within chalcopyrite in association with other rare tellurides, such as merenskyite, stuetzite and hessite. Also discovered on the island was an unnamed palladium mercury silver telluride mineral, the composition and optical properties of which are significantly different from those of temagamite. Paleogeology The TGB, at 2.7 billion years old, dates back to the formation of the supercontinent Kenorland between 2.8 and 2.6 billion years ago. This large landmass consisted of the Baltic and Siberian shields of Eurasia and Archean provinces of North America, including the Superior craton of which the Temagami belt occupies a part. Rifting of Kenorland began 2.45 billion years ago in Ontario with the formation of several large igneous provinces. Initial rifting is represented by basal mafic volcanic rocks in the nearby Huronian Supergroup. Final breakup formed a large group of mafic dike and sill swarms in the North American provinces 2.2‚Äì2.1 billion years ago. By the Paleoproterozoic era Kenorland had already rifted apart, and the TGB formed a small part of the supercontinent Columbia starting 1.9‚Äì1.8 billion years ago. Eastern India, Australia, Laurentia, Baltica, North China, the Amazon shield and portions of Antarctica formed the landmass until it ruptured 1.5‚Äì1.4 billion years ago. In the late Mesoproterozoic era 1.1 billion years ago, the Temagami belt was part of another supercontinent. This former supercontinent, known as Rodinia, included Oaxaquia, Rockall, Laurentia, Baltica, Australia, West Africa, South China, Amazonia, Mawson and R√≠o de la Plata cratons, as well as the Pampean terrane. Laurentia, which included the Superior craton and the TGB, is interpreted to have formed the core of Rodinia because it is surrounded by passive margins formed during the breakup of the supercontinent some 750 million years ago. After Rodinia broke apart, its southern half traveled south and crossed the South Pole while its northern half traveled northward to the North Pole. The two halves of Rodinia eventually collided with the Congo craton to form the supercontinent Pannotia 600 million years ago. In contrast to Rodinia, Pannotia was short-lived. It rifted apart 545 million years ago, or only 65 million years after it formed. This resulted in the creation of at least four continents, namely Baltica, Siberia, Gondwana and Laurentia. By the Early Cambrian 514 million years ago, Laurenta was located on the equator, Baltica was south of Laurenta, Siberia was just south of the equator east of Laurenta, and Gondwana lied mostly in the Southern Hemisphere. Subsequently, Baltica, Laurenta and microcontinent Avalonia collided in the Devonian period (416-359 million years ago) to form minor supercontinent Euramerica. This eventually started to collide with Gondwana and other landmasses to form supercontinent Pangaea 255 million years ago. In the Late Triassic period some 152 million years ago, Pangaea split into two minor supercontinents, namely Gondwana and Laurasia. The TGB represented a minor portion of western Laurasia until it divided into Eurasia and North America about 94 million years ago. Since the Middle Miocene 14 million years ago, the TGB has been part of the Americas, a minor north-south trending supercontinent comprising the continents of North America and South America. Human history Naming The name \\"Temagami\\" is Ojibwe in origin, meaning \\"deep clear water\\"; until 1968 it was spelt as \\"Timagami\\". This spelling of the name appeared on all official maps and related documents when it was adopted on June 25, 1906. In early 1968 the Canada Post Office applied to the Geographical Names Board of Canada for a spelling reform to Temagami at the instigation of the general public. The Executive Secretary of this committee subsequently applied to the Lands and Surveys Branch of the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests. This former department, now part of Ministry of Natural Resources, corresponded with the proposed renaming of Timagami on March 20, 1968, as well as for Lake Timagami, Timagami Island and the Timagami River. Further improvements occurred when the Geographical Names Board of Canada agreed to change the name spelling to Temagami on March 27, 1968. Nevertheless, the original spelling (Timagami) has appeared in documents published after the renaming, including Kent C. Condie's 1981 book Archean Greenstone Belts. Mineral explorations Iron ore pellets collected from the Sherman Mine railroad. Sherman Mine was the last mine to operate in the Temagami Greenstone Belt In May 1995 Pacific Mariner Exploration carried out a small drilling program on its properties in Strathy Township to estimate the likelihood of base metal deposits. A hole was drilled under Net Lake in Temagami North, but its collapse prevented the survey's completion. As a result, little is known about its geophysical features. Most of the property was influenced by Net Lake and included ten adjacent mining claims. At least five explorations took place in the Strathy Township property before 1995. In 1934 Strathy Basin and Erie Canadian Mines conducted prospected sections of the 1995 claim block. A wide rusted zone within a dike was announced as containing values of $7.50 combined gold, copper and nickel. Little work has been completed in this area. In 1959 and 1960, Goldfields Mining conducted a basic airborne electromagnetic survey and magnetic survey over the property. Several holes were drilled and intersected mostly mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks and areas of stringer sulfides with pyrrhotite, pyrite and some chalcopyrite. No assays were reported. In 1970 E. L. McVeigh occupied a section of the property, including the area that was once owned by Strathy Basin Mines. McVeigh conducted geophysical surveys over Strathy Basin's mineralized zone and announced no conductors. From 1974 to 1975 Vale Limited owned an extensive section of the Strathy Township property. They conducted magnetic and electromagnetic surveys, as well as mapping and drilling. Vale announced that they intersected mineralized sulfide zones ranging from to thick. In 1952 Rib Lake Copper Mines explored areas adjacent to Whitney Lake and between Whitney Lake and Rib Lake, by creating trenches and carrying out diamond drilling. Nickel was discovered with widespread pyrrhotite in sheared mafic rocks. Gold mineralization was discovered with pyrite in slightly siliceous tuff. The highest assessment was of gold per ton and 0.99% of nickel over , both from the same zone. Detailed work did not occur in the Rib Lake area of southern Gillies Limit Township and northern Best Township until 1968, when mapping took place, but it is unclear whether volcanic rocks in the Rib Lake area are part of the TGB, as they have not been mapped in any detail. With the existence of Early Archean age tholeiitic and/or calc-alkaline mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks, they may represent a minor continuation of the belt, which is located about to the southwest. Small intrusions and pyroclastics of mafic composition are also present in the area. In 1956 Silanco carried out geophysics south of Whitney Lake. In 1964 Nickel Rim Mines Ltd. had a greatest result of of gold per ton. The exploration and mining activity south of Gillies Limit Township observed nickel, copper and platinum group metals at Cuniptau Mine and gold, silver and copper at the Big Dan and Little Dan mines. Mining East Pit of Sherman Mine. This image was taken from a cliff in the middle of the pit Because of the high mineralization, several mines have opened in the belt. Sherman Mine, northwest of the town of Temagami, was a major producer of iron ore. Mining operations began in 1968, and workings consisted of seven open pits: North Pit, East Pit, South Pit, West Pit and three relatively small open pits known as the Turtle Pits. A railroad was built from the Ontario Northland Railway to Sherman Mine in the 1960s to make transportation and shipping of iron ore easier and faster across Ontario. To the north, Temagami North was constructed as a resource town in the 1960s to supply Sherman Mine. With an average overall grade of 25% iron, the mine produced approximately 10,700 tons of crude ore per day and its mill capacity was of iron ore pellets per year. Operations at Sherman Mine ceased in 1990 after its owner Dofasco announced that they would be closing the mine. The municipality of Temagami made several approaches to Dofasco before the closer of Sherman Mine, offering a partnership in the community's future in terms of shared funding for a Sherman Park. However, it was informed during discussions with Dofasco's media executives that in the future they could not be counted on for maintenance funds for parks or anything else that was being done in partnership with the community. This caused a large attitudinal change from a few months earlier when the mine was associated with much of Temagami. The closure also had a significant impact on the economy of Temagami. There is still iron ore at Sherman Mine, but Dofasco were able to obtain it more cheaply elsewhere. Flooded open pit at Kanichee Mine. The latest mining took place at Kanichee Mine during the 1970s The Kanichee Mine property, formerly known as Cuniptau Mine, was first discovered in the early 1900s just before World War I began. A mine shaft with of underground lateral workings was completed on two levels in 1934. At least 11 mine claims occupied the area at the time. The core of a widespread massive sulfide deposit composed of palladium, nickel, copper, gold, cobalt, platinum and silver was mined out from underground and by an open pit from 1934 to 1936. Since 1938, at least seven different ownerships have held the Kanichee Mine property. Subsequent mining from 1974 to 1975 increased the size of the open pit and removed the shaft pillar. The open pit and underground workings have remain flooded since the mine closed in the 1970s. Copperfields Mine, originally known as Temagami Mine, extracted both base and precious metals on Temagami Island in Lake Temagami from March 1955 until its closer in February 1972. A 200-ton mill refined ore from two open pits and underground workings off a mine shaft. For the first few years after the mine opened, ore trucks were barged down the northeastern arm of Lake Temagami to the town of Temagami, but this soon proved to be too expensive. The result was to create a gravel road from Highway 11 to the eastcentral shore of Lake Temagami. This road, now known as the Lake Temagami Access Road, was completed in 1958 and was used to transport ore from the mine site. The high-grade copper deposit in which the mine extracted was discovered by Canadian geophysicist Norman Bell Keevil (1910‚Äì1989) in the mid-20th century during testing of a newly established airborne metal detector. It was the largest deposit of nearly pure chalcopyrite ever discovered in Canada. Keevil also financed other ventures, including what became Teck Resources. By February 1972, the Copperfields mill had treated of gold, of silver and of copper. Along the southeastern margin of the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone lies the abandoned Beanland Mine property. Exploration work in 1937‚Äì1938 resulted in the creation of a three level mine shaft. In February 1992, Deak Resources completed diamond drilling and bulk sampling at the mine and 3,000 tons of rock was shipped to its Kerr Mill in Virginiatown. The estimated reserves, before this work, were 8,778 tons averaging of gold per ton across a mining width and 24,000 tons averaging of gold per ton across a mining width. The mineralized zone is described as a quartz vein network, enveloped by alteration in tholeiitic basalts, paralleling the Net Lake- Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. The flooded remains of a mine shaft on the Leckie Mine property, immediately east of Arsenic Lake About north of Beanland lies the abandoned Hermiston-McCauley Mine, situated on the northwestern side of the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. From 1935 to 1940, a three- compartment mine shaft was constructed. Three levels were created, two of which had of lateral work. Reserves have been variously estimated at 31,000 tons averaging of gold per ton, 45,700 tons averaging of gold per ton over , or 9,000 tons averaging of gold per ton over . A main and subsidiary quartz- rich zone occur in a ruptured intrusion composed of diorite, which intrudes felsic volcanic rocks in a northwesterly direction with the strike of the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. The main vein is at least long and up to wide. Pyrite with chalcopyrite and gold occupies the quartz-rich zones as blebs and small veins. Mining operations began at Leckie Mine, a now abandoned gold mine north of the Temagami, in the early 1900s with the construction of a mine shaft with of underground workings. In 1909 about 270 tons of ore was shipped out of the shaft. A mine shaft with five levels was constructed during a second period of exploration from 1930 to 1948. About of drifting and crosscutting was completed on all five levels. Production continued at the Big Dan Occurrences during the early 20th century. Two shallow mine shafts were created in 1906 and were used to ship ore out of the mine. At least of gold per ton was sent during this period. The mine was constructed in a , north striking mineralized portion of the Big Dan Shear Zone.

Construction of the spacecraft bus and integration of the satellite's payloads was accomplished by Boeing at their Seal Beach, CA facility. The program was funded and led by the DoD's Space Test Program (STP) as mission P91-1 (the first STP mission contract awarded in 1991). The $220M mission was operated by Air Force Space Command's Space and Missile Systems Center's Test and Evaluation Directorate (then Space Development and Test Wing, now SMC's Advanced Systems and Development Directorate)\\"SMC stands up new Advanced Systems and Development Directorate\\", 24 November 2014 from their RDT&E; Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM. ARGOS was the first mission operated 100% from the new state-of-the-art, commercial-off-the-shelf Kirtland facility; all previous SMC satellite missions had been operated in total or at least in part from the preceding center at Onizuka AFS, CA.  Mission  \\"The ARGOS satellite will provide a tremendous payoff in critical technologies such as imaging, satellite propulsion and space-based computing. These areas will become important as more and more applications of space are developed,\\" said Colonel Tom Mead, program manager of the DoD Space Test Program. The ARGOS had a design life of three years and was part of the DoD Space Test Program (STP), which supports the Air Force, Army, Navy, BMDO (now MDA), NASA, and various international space agencies. The nine ARGOS payloads, addressing more than 30 research objectives, conducted upper atmospheric observations and technology demonstrations. These included sensor technology for the International Space Station, as well as three high-priority ultraviolet imaging experiments and an X-ray sensor. The remaining experiments investigate ion propulsion, gas ionization physics, plume detection capabilities, and orbital debris. As part of DOD STP, ARGOS served the need to fly Department of Defense payloads that cannot be flown on the Space Shuttle or aboard small launch vehicles due to complexity, size, mission duration, or other constraints. The Naval Research Laboratory, U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command, Air Force Research Laboratory, and Office of Naval Research have provided payloads for the ARGOS mission.Turner, J.

Experiment (DOD Selective Experiments Review Board Year- Rank/Sponsor): * CERTO - Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomography Experiment (1996-18/NRL) instrumentation, developed by NRL's Plasma Physics Division, consists of a stable radio beacon transmitter on the satellite and a chain of receivers on the ground. Radio transmissions from the CERTO beacon are processed by the ground receivers to produce two-dimensional maps of the electron densities in the ionosphere. The CERTO measurement technique provides images of the ionosphere with 10 km vertical and horizontal resolution. In addition, ionospheric irregularities of 1 km or less in size can be determined by fluctuations in the CERTO radio waves. CERTO can also be used to calibrate the ionospheric densities obtained using the EUV instruments such as HIRAAS, GIMI, and EUVIP on ARGOS. The CERTO radio-based technique has the advantage of higher spatial resolution than provided by the EUV-based techniques, but requires ground-based receivers aligned under the satellite orbit. The two techniques together on the same satellite provide substantial improvements over each technique separately. CERTO principal investigator, Dr. Paul Bernhardt notes that the NRL instruments on ARGOS will be the first demonstration combining EUV and radio sensors for enhanced imaging of the ionosphere. * CIV - Critical Ionization Velocity Experiment (1990-9/AFRL- Kirtland AFB) Release of xenon and carbon dioxide gases from nozzles on the ARGOS orbiting with a velocity of about 7.4 km/s at an altitude of about 800 km is proposed. The releases will be conducted mostly in darkness over the Maui telescope site. The vector sum of the satellite and gas velocities will exceed the velocity requirement for the critical ionization velocity (CIV) process of xenon. It is feasible that the xenon gas will achieve critical velocity ionization. Associative ionization and collisional stripping will not occur for the xenon gas and there is no photo-ionization in darkness; ionization processes competing with CIV are absent. Neutral density, ambient magnetic field, and seed ionization effects on the xenon gas CIV will be discussed. Unlike xenon, carbon dioxide will not undergo CIV because of its higher velocity requirement. However, it is feasible that carbon dioxide colliding with the atmospheric species will form excited CO and OH molecules, which will radiate subsequently. Optical, IR, and UV observations on the satellite and at Maui Optical Telescope will provide diagnostic measurements for the experiment.Lai, S., H√§ggstr√∂m, I., Wannberg, G., Westman, A., Cooke, D., Wright, L., Groves, K., and Pellinen-Wannberg, A., ‚ÄúA Critical Ionization Velocity Experiment on the ARGOS Satellite,‚Äù 45th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, Reno, Nevada, Jan. 8-11, 2007, AIAA-2007-279. * ESEX - Electric Propulsion Space Experiment (1990-13/AFRL-Edwards AFB): an effort by the Air Force Research Laboratory's Propulsion Directorate (Edwards AFB, CA) demonstrated a high-powered electric propulsion provided by a 26 kilowatt ammonia fueled arcjet.Press Release USAF, \\"NEW SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEM FIRED,\\" March 17, 1999.

Through the ionizing of ammonia, ESEX's electric propulsion was expected to double the payload-to-orbit capability of current space propulsion systems. The ammonia propellant consumed was four times less than the best performing chemical rocket engine in use at that time. For the team, the best information gathered was the validation that firing the highest powered electric propulsion system in space did not interrupt telemetry or affect other equipment on the spacecraft.Sutton, A.M., Bromaghim, D R., Johnson, L K. ‚ÄúElectric Propulsion Space Experiment (ESEX) Flight Qualification and Operations,‚Äù Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, 31st, San Diego, CA, July 10‚Äì12, 1995, AIAA-1995-2503. * EUVIP - Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Photometer Experiment (1990-8/Army Space & Strategic Defense Command) will establish the behavior of the upper atmosphere and plasmasphere needed for Army secure communication systems design, prediction of magnetic storms, and characterization of the aurora.NSSDC Master Catalog Search, NSSDC ID: 1999-008A-02 * GIMI - Global Imaging Monitor of the Ionosphere Experiment (1990-19/NRL) will obtain wide-field FUV/EUV images of ionospheric and upper atmospheric emissions simultaneously, covering large areas of the earth from a low Earth orbit. These images will be used to determine chemical densities [O+, nighttime O2, NO and N2] on a global basis and to detect disturbances in the ionosphere that are caused by auroral activity, gravity waves and foreign materials from meteors, suspected \\"ice comets,\\" rocket exhausts and chemical releases. In between the atmospheric observations, GIMI will also perform an all-sky survey of stars and celestial diffuse sources at far-ultraviolet wavelengths. The GIMI instrument has two coaligned cameras for simultaneous observations of selected targets. Camera 1, which is sensitive in the 75-110 nm range, will primarily be used for observations of the dayside ionosphere, auroras, and stellar occultations, and for star field surveys. Camera 2 is sensitive in the 131-160 and 131-200 nm far-UV wavelength ranges and will be used for observations of the nightside ionosphere, airglow, stellar occultations, star field surveys, and also gas releases and rocket plumes at night. * HIRAAS - High Resolution Airglow/Aurora Spectrograph Experiment (1990-5/NRL) is a multi-instrument experiment that will scan the edge of the Earth's atmosphere (called the limb) about every 90 seconds to measure naturally occurring airglow missions in the 50 to 340 nanometer (nm) wavelength range over a wide array of geophysical conditions and at varying local times. The instruments will perform continuous observations over several spectral bands with resolution up to ten times better than with previous experiments. These measurements will be used to infer the composition (O+, N2, O, and O2) and temperature. Data from the HIRAAS experiment will be used to explore new concepts in monitoring space weather from satellites, and to improve high frequency communications and over-the-horizon radar, which rely on propagation through the atmosphere. The measurements will also help researchers assess the long-term effects of the increases of atmospheric greenhouse gases on the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. * HTSSE II - High Temperature Superconductivity Space Experiment (1992-2/NRL): developed by the Naval Research Laboratory will space qualify superconducting digital subsystems that could offer factors of 100 to 1000 in power reduction - more than ten times higher speed and similar weight reduction, than today's silicon or gallium arsenide (GaAs) based electronics. Spacecraft designers will evaluate the benefits for future systems. * SPADUS - Space Dust Experiment (1990-33/Office of Naval Research) sponsored by the University of Chicago with funding by the Office of Naval Research, will measure velocity and impact of dust in space orbit. * USA - Unconventional Stellar Aspect (1990-22/NRL) - Sponsored by Naval Research Lab, Space Science Division, the USA experiment was designed to observe bright x-ray sources, mostly binary star systems, including a black hole, a neutron star, or a white dwarf, orbiting with a more typical star. In neutron stars, gravity has compressed matter down to densities larger than those found in the nucleus of an atom. In all of these types of binary systems, extraordinarily strong, relativistic gravitational forces and enormous magnetic fields act in concert to produce dramatic phenomena not observable from Earth-based laboratories. In addition to providing valuable new information for astrophysicists and particle physicists, USA has been designed to make significant contributions to applied science, environmental science, and engineering research. It will use x-ray sources to test new approaches to satellite navigation and to conduct the first tomographic survey of Earth's atmosphere. It will also test new concepts for making spacecraft computers more reliable, an approach called fault- tolerant computing. Finally, a unique feature of USA is that photon events are time tagged by reference to an onboard GPS receiver allowing precise absolute time and location determination. USA operated from May 1, 1999, through November 16, 2000.

Gemma Bellincioni (born Matilda Cesira Bellincioni) (; 18 August 1864 - 23 April 1950) was an Italian soprano and one of the best-known opera singers of the late 19th century. She had a particular affinity with the verismo repertoire and was renowned more for her charismatic acting than for the quality of her voice. Her career Matilda Cesira Bellincioni was Bellincioni's real name. She was born in Monza, Italy, in 1864. Both her parents were singers, and after receiving training from them, she made her operatic debut in Naples in 1880. She went on to sing extensively in Europe and South America during the next two decades, although she would appear only once in London‚Äîat the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden‚Äîin 1895. Despite her fame, she never performed at America's foremost operatic venue, the New York Metropolitan Opera. Italy's leading composer, Giuseppe Verdi, admired Bellincioni's acting ability. Verdi had encountered her in 1886 when she performed Violetta in his opera La traviata at La Scala, Milan. Evidently, however, he was not so impressed by her vocal technique because he did not elect to cast her to sing the part of Desdemona at the premiere of Otello the following year. On the other hand, Bellincioni's histrionic manner, accentuated diction and arresting stage presence were to prove ideally suited to a melodramatic new style of Italian opera known as verismo, which became popular during the 1890s. She sang this type of music with great passion, although her actual voice was not particularly large in size or ripe in tone, and marred by a distinct flutter. (See Scott, cited below.) On 17 May 1890, she created the role of Santuzza in Pietro Mascagni's landmark verismo work Cavalleria Rusticana when it premiered in Rome. Her common-law spouse Roberto Stagno, a prominent tenor from Sicily, sang opposite her in the role of Turiddu at that same premiere performance: they had met on a tour of Argentina in 1886. Bellincioni was also the first soprano to perform the title role in another key verismo opera, Umberto Giordano's Fedora, on 17 November 1898. (Her tenor partner on this occasion was a promising young singer named Enrico Caruso.) Eight years later, she starred in the Italian premiere of Richard Strauss' Salome. She announced her retirement from the stage in 1911 to teach singing, but re-emerged in 1916 to play the lead female part in a silent-film version of Cavalleria Rusticana that was directed by Ugo Falena. As late as the early 1920s, she gave a few performances in The Netherlands, but her voice was said to be in a threadbare condition by this date. Bellincioni had written an instructional manual for singers which was published in Berlin in 1912 and an autobiography, Io e il palcoscenico, which was published in Milan in 1920. She spent her final years living in Naples, where she died at the age of 85, survived by a daughter. (Stagno, her de facto husband, had died 53 years earlier.) Bellincioni's voice can still be heard on CD reissues (most notably on the Marston label) of a few recordings which she made for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company and the Path√© firm in the early 1900s (decade). She was past her best when she made them and they disappoint artistically and musically; but they are considered to be of major historical interest because her career was so significant (see Scott cited below).

Gustave Doret (20 September 1866 ‚Äì 19 April 1943) was a Swiss composer and conductor. Doret was born in 1866 in Aigle, Switzerland. He studied at the Berlin Academy of Music with Joseph Joachim, and then at the Conservatoire de Paris with Th√©odore Dubois and Jules Massenet. His career as a conductor began in 1894 in Paris, where he led the first performance of Debussy's Pr√©lude √† l'apr√®s-midi d'un faune. He was second conductor of the Concerts d'Harcourt from 1893 to 1895 and director of the Op√©ra-Comique in the 1890s and 1900s. He was also the founder of the Th√©√¢tre du Jorat, in M√©zi√®res. His two serious operas, heavily indebted to Massenet, were performed in Paris; his light opera and other stage works were far more popular across French- speaking Europe. In 1914, Doret returned to Switzerland and began studying local popular music and folk music traditions. He also wrote for Swiss newspapers and wrote a memoir, Temps et contretemps, published in 1942. Most of his output was vocal, and included operas, music theatre pieces, one oratorio, choral music, and more than 300 songs. His only instrumental works were two orchestral pieces, a string quartet, and a piano quintet. His work was part of the music event in the art competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

Rains (October 2, 1817 - May 19, 1880) was a senior officer of the Missouri State Guard who fought in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. Early life and career James Spencer Rains was born in Tennessee to Asahel and Malvina (Duncan) Rains. By 1840, Rains had moved to the vicinity of Sarcoxie, Missouri. He served as prewar general of the militia and as Newton County, Missouri judge from 1840 to 1842. In 1844, he was elected to the state house by Newton County and served in the Missouri Senate from 1854 to 1861. Between 1845 and 1852, Rains served as an agent for Indian affairs in various locations and ventured to California as a \\"forty-niner\\", where he served as a general in the California state militia. In 1860, Rains was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Congress for the Southwest Missouri District. Rains County, Texas is named for his brother Emory Rains, an early Texas legislator. American Civil War On May 18, 1861, Governor Claiborne Jackson of Missouri appointed Rains brigadier general of the 8th Division of the Missouri State Guard. While he was an excellent recruiter, Rains was completely unfit for military command. His failure to instill organization and discipline led to derisive nicknames such as \\"Rains' Blackberry Cavalry\\" and routs referred to as \\"Rains' scares.\\" Rains led his command ineptly at the Battle of Carthage as his cavalry failed to cut off the retreat of a small Union force over open prairie. (It is a matter of historical contention as to whether he was in command of the whole Missouri State Guard on the field, but if he was, he seems to have provided no direction beyond his own 8th Division.) His standing did not improve when his cavalry panicked and was routed in a skirmish south of Springfield at Dug Springs. At the Battle of Wilson's Creek, his force was surprised and driven away by the initial attack of Brig. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon's advancing infantry. Rains continued to serve in the major battles of the Missouri State Guard in 1861 and 1862. He was wounded at the Battle of Pea Ridge and ran afoul of the commander of the Confederate forces, Earl Van Dorn, during the retreat. Rains did not accompany the Missouri forces across the river into Mississippi in April 1862. He remained behind with other Missouri State Guard forces who did not wish to leave the Trans-Mississippi. Major General Thomas Hindman placed Rains in command of the mixed guard and Confederate forces in Northwest Arkansas. Hindman relieved Rains of command in October 1862 for \\"incompetence and insobriety.\\" Rains moved to Texas to recover his health. In 1864, he returned to Missouri at the command of Confederate Governor Thomas C. Reynolds to recruit during Price's Missouri Expedition. With the end of the expedition, Rains withdrew. Later life and death After the war, Rains settled in Wood County, Texas and later Kaufman County, Texas, where he became a farmer, railroad promoter, lawyer, and political organizer/candidate. He failed in his run for lieutenant governor in 1878. He died on May 19, 1880 at his home and is buried at Lee Cemetery in Seagoville, Dallas County.

It was established in 2002 and is dedicated to the performance of contemporary classical music, most often works by the orchestra's members. The group has also performed music by other California composers, including John Cage, Henry Cowell, Bernard Herrmann, Darius Milhaud, Terry Riley, Gerhard Samuel, and Igor Stravinsky. The orchestra's conductor, co-founder, and music director is Mark Alburger; co-founder and executive director is Erling Wold. Its associate conductors are John Kendall Bailey and Martha Stoddard; other board members are Michael Cooke, Lisa Scola Prosek. The San Francisco Composers Chamber Orchestra (SFCCO) is a unique orchestra in the U.S. Since its first concert in March 2002, the SFCCO has premiered more new works than any other orchestra in the San Francisco Bay Area. The ensemble consists primarily of composer/performers, forming a unique organization dedicated to democratizing the symphony orchestra, making it available to composers of many styles and in many stages of development, from the established to the emerging. The result is a diverse offering of new music. In any one concert, an audience may hear many styles, including Neoromantic, Serial, Neoclassical, Minimalist, Noise and Improvised. The SFCCO takes an informal approach to its concerts, emphasizing communication with the audience in talks before, between and after pieces, drawing listeners into the music-making. The group's goal is to reverse the mainstream orchestral trend which features mostly older classical music by performing 6-8 new works a concert, rather than only a few new pieces a year.

As St. James-the-Less Episcopal Church, it was designated a National Historic Landmark for its Gothic Revival architecture, which influenced a generation of subsequent churches. History Philanthropist and merchant Robert Ralston wanted to found a church near his land on Ridge Road, but died shortly before this church's founding. His friend Samuel Jarvis had helped found the General Theological Seminary in New York and knew about the Cambridge Camden Society.NRIS section 8 This congregation was admitted to the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania on 22 May 1846 and on 26 September 1846, took the corporate name of \\"Rector, Church Wardens and Vestrymen of St. James the Less.\\" The new congregation acquired land from nearby Laurel Hill Cemetery and wanted to build a church that could serve not only the wealthy families with mansions overlooking the Schuylkill River or on Hunting Park Avenue, but also working- class people of the nearby industrial neighborhood now known as Allegheny West. The parish was traditionally High Church. It did not install gas lighting in 1869, but did allow oil lamps to replace the original candles circa 1885. Further modernization occurred in the early 20th century, including not only the tower and chimes (dedicated 1910) but also electric lighting and central heat circa 1913. Documents concerning its Anglo-Catholic practices in the early 20th century. HABS Front view of the church in 1972 Architecture The building was added to the list of National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985. The National Park Service called it \\"the first example of the pure English Parish church style in America, and one of the best examples of a 19th-century American Gothic church for its coherence and authenticity of design. Its influence on the major architects of the Gothic Revival in the United States was profound.\\"Listing at the National Park Service St. Michael's Church, now disused, Longstanton, Cambridgeshire, England, the model for St. James-the- Less The Gothic architecture was nearly accidental. The congregation applied to the Cambridge Camden Society, which in 1841 and 1844 had published a widely circulated pamphlet on modern church design, for a set of approved plans. Originally an organization formed by Cambridge University students interested in gothic architecture, the group advocated combining the piety of gothic architecture with church reform associated with the Oxford Movement. It was inadvertently sent measured drawings prepared by English architect George Gordon Place for St. Michael's Church in Longstanton, Cambridgeshire, built c. 1230, which were then followed in every detail under the supervision of architect John E. Carver.American Architecture: A History, by Leland M. Roth Later American churches on the National Register of Historic Places influenced by St. James' design include All Saint's Memorial Church (Navesink, New Jersey) (designed by Richard Upjohn first President of the American Institute of Architects) and St. Peter's Episcopal Church (Neligh, Nebraska). Set on the edge of a hill, north of Mount Vernon Cemetery and east of Laurel Hill Cemetery, the setting for the church is no longer rural. West Hunting Park Avenue, a major artery, is just beyond the churchyard's south wall, and industrial buildings lie to the west. Now, however, the shady and quiet churchyard is considered an urban oasis. The Wanamaker Memorial Bell Tower and mausoleum (1908), designed by John T. Windrim, houses a set of J.C. Deagan, Inc. tower chimes and a chime of bells by the McShane foundry. A parish hall, which later housed the parish school, was built on the opposite side of West Clearfield Street. Current parish(es) The congregation of St James the Less began withholding diocesan payments in protest over the ordination of women. After the bishop refused to renew the preaching license of assistant Rev. Willis in 1999, the congregation attempted to form a nonprofit corporation and transfer the church property into it.In re: Church of St James the Less. 953 N.P. 2001.

In 2008 the diocese's Standing Committee voted to allow historic St. Mark's Church in Philadelphia's center city neighborhood to adopt the Church of St. James the Less as a mission. Weekly celebration of Mass resumed on Sundays at 5:00 pm.

The refuge includes Long Island with stands of old growth Western red cedar and hemlock. Wildlife and habitat Willapa National Wildlife Refuge preserves many of unique ecosystems including salt marshes, muddy tideflats, rain drenched old growth forests, and coastal dunes and beaches. Freshwater marshes and grasslands are found along the southern shore of Willapa Bay. Visitors to the Willapa National Wildlife Refuge can enjoy viewing a wide variety of wildlife. Roosevelt elk, black bear, shorebirds, and spawning salmon are just a few of the many species that reside on the Refuge. The refuge is home to several endangered and threatened species including the snowy plover, marbled murrelets, and brown pelican. Other birds that are commonly spotted throughout the refuge include bald eagles, great blue herons, peregrine falcons, red-tailed hawks, marsh wrens, and golden- crowned kinglets. Management activities Willapa National Wildlife Refuge deals with a number of unique challenges. While it contains many pristine areas, it also includes many recent acquisitions where considerable restoration efforts are needed. It includes a vast diversity of habitats from ocean sand dune beaches to the sheltered mudflats of the bay, from pristine old growth forests to open saltgrass meadows. The refuge is home to several threatened and endangered species and is trying to restore habitat for many others. Like many places, Willapa NWR is also coping with the threat of invasive species.

Stent (28 March 1924 - 12 June 2008) was Graduate Professor of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. One of the early bacteriophage biologists, he was known also for his studies on the metabolism of bacteria and neurobiology of leeches, and for his writing on the history and philosophy of biology. Early life and early career He was born G√ºnter Siegmund Stensch in Berlin. His surname was changed following his emigration to the US in 1940, where he went to live in Chicago. He received his BS (1945) and PhD (1948) from the University of Illinois. In 1949, Gunther Stent joined the small group of phage workers under Max Delbr√ºck at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. This phage group was the incubator for many of the fundamental ideas of the newly emerging science of molecular biology. Informal discussions among these workers on the progress of their research led to a book by Stent entitled \\"Molecular Biology of Bacterial Viruses\\" (dedicated to Max Delbr√ºck) which was a lucid account of the state of accomplishments in the field up to 1963.Stent GS. 1963. Molecular Biology of Bacterial Viruses. WH Freeman and Co., San Francisco, CA. ASIN: B002OXAPMO Later, in his memoirs,Stent GS. (1998). Nazis, Women, and Molecular Biology: Memoirs of a Lucky Self-hater. Kensington, Calif: Briones Books. Stent described some of his activities and interactions with others of the group. These personal memories illustrated the unique intellectual spirit of the phage group during its early crucial years (1948‚Äì1950). Overview His introductory textbook, Molecular Genetics; an Introductory Narrative has been translated into Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. He was perhaps most generally known for his works on the progress of science, especially his 1969 lectures at Berkeley published as The Coming of the Golden Age. Stent lectured in the molecular biology portion of Biology 1 at UC Berkeley. He had a very unusual lecture style; he introduced the major experiments that advanced the field of molecular biology in chronological order. It provided students with a unique understanding of molecular biology and experimentation. Stent was at Oxford in 1953 when Watson and Crick made their announcement that they had \\"discovered the secret of life.\\" Watson's book \\"The Double Helix\\" includes a picture of Stent with Watson and Crick.  Religious views  When asked \\"Do you believe in God?\\" Stent stated: \\"I don't know whether I do, even though I believe that I as a scientist ought to. But, by way of a paradox, I do believe, as Planck did, that all scientists have to believe in Him.\\"Hargittai, Istva'n & Magdolna. 2006. Candid Science V: Conversations with Famous Scientists.

Originally planning to become a minister, he enrolled in Princeton University, but soon his interests changed to science. He graduated from Princeton in 1901 with a bachelor's degree, and earned a Master of Science degree in 1902. He then went to Europe to study under Walther Nernst and Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff. On returning to the United States, Hudson worked as a physics instructor for a year at Princeton University and later at the University of Illinois, earning a Ph.D. in 1907. He later held positions at the National Bureau of Standards and the NIH (1928 - 1951), both in Washington, DC. He was elected to the National Academy of Science in 1927. Hudson is also remembered for the so-called Hudson's rules, concerning the optical rotation of sugars. He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1942 and the Willard Gibbs Award in 1929.

It was not used until the Vietnam War, when it was issued to elite reconnaissance and special operations units beginning early 1967.Tom Vanderbilt, \\"The Army's new camouflage\\", Slate Magazine The pattern consists of four colors printed in an interlocking pattern. It was initially produced in a lime-dominant colorway, consisting of large organic shapes in mid green and brown, black ‚Äòbranches‚Äô, and light green ‚Äòleaf highlights‚Äô. Shortly thereafter a brown-dominant scheme (with the light green replaced by light tan) was manufactured. The two patterns are also unofficially known as \\"Lowland\\" and \\"Highland\\" ERDL, respectively. History The United States Marine Corps (USMC) adopted the green \\"Lowland\\" version as standard issue in South Vietnam from 1968, and later the U.S. Army introduced it on a wide scale in Southeast Asia. The ERDL-pattern combat uniform was identical in cut to the OG-107 jungle fatigues it was issued alongside. It was common for Marines to wear mixes of ERDL and OG-107 jungle fatigues, which was authorized owing to periodic shortages. Australian and New Zealand SAS members were also issued U.S.-spec tropical combat uniforms in ERDL during their time in the Vietnam War. By the end of the Vietnam War, U.S. servicemen wore camouflage combat dress as the norm. Following the withdrawal of the U.S. military from South Vietnam in 1973, the U.S. Army no longer routinely issued camouflage clothing. The 1st Battalion, 13th Infantry Regiment wore the ERDL- leaf pattern as an experiment in the early 1970s from January 1973 to 1974\\"1st Bn 13th Inf Stands Out as Div Unit\\", The Arrow (19 November 1973), p. VI in Baumholder, Germany. Soldiers in the 1st and 2d Ranger Battalions (1/75 & 2/75 Ranger [Airborne]) received ERDL jungle fatigues of all three varieties as organizational issue, and during this same period U.S. Army Special Forces Groups, the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, the 82d Airborne Division and 36th Airborne Brigade (Texas National Guard) were issued the ERDL jungle fatigues until replaced by BDUs. 1st Battalion (mechanized), 41st Infantry, wore ERDL uniforms in 1974 and 1975. This unit was the \\"tip of the spear\\" for the Second Armored Division with assignments at Ft. Hood, Texas and Hohenfels, West Germany. In 1976, the Marines obtained the leftover Vietnam War-era ERDL pattern uniforms which became general issue, replacing the solid OG-107 sateen utility/fatigue uniform. As there was never an ERDL pattern Marine-style utility cap, the Marines continued to wear the solid OG utility hat until the adoption of the BDU pattern. The Army had a similar problem, while most units issued ERDL pattern uniforms wore a beret in garrison, the M1951 field cap or patrol cap worn in the field by Ranger and Special Forces units was a solid OG. However there was a ERDL pattern boonie hat. The uniform was to be used to equip the United States Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) while on tropical missions. Photographs during the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis show U.S. marines guarding the U.S. embassy wearing the RDF version ERDL uniforms when they were taken hostage by Iranian revolutionaries. It was not until 1981 that the Army approved another camouflaged uniform. That year it officially introduced the M81 Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) in Woodland pattern, an enlarged and slightly altered version of ERDL, to supply all arms of the U.S. military. The last batches of the ERDL-patterned fatigues saw service into the 1980s, notably during Operation Eagle Claw, peacekeeping operations in Beirut, and the invasion of Grenada. Samples of the ERDL pattern acquired during the Vietnam War were shipped to the USSR, where it used as the basis for making the TTsKO camouflage pattern. Garment types, designs, and use in Southeast Asia (1967‚Äì72) The ERDL pattern was used on official and unofficial U.S. military garments in Southeast Asia (SEA), in both ground and aviation garment versions, from 1967 to the war's end. Early production on the ERDL ran into problems due to roller slippage, which results in inconsistencies with the patterns that were printed. On official ground combat garments, the ERDL pattern was first applied to the third model Tropical Combat Uniform around 1967, and was printed onto a lightweight cotton poplin textile material. This poplin uniform was very short-lived, but it did see combat use in SEA by various U.S. special operations and some other units. Soon afterward, the ERDL pattern was printed onto the standard rip-stop cotton textile material. This ERDL rip-stop cotton Tropical Combat Uniform version thus saw wide use in SEA after 1968, with special operations units and also regular units, especially as ground combat operations continued throughout the war up to late 1972. On official aviation combat garments, the ERDL pattern was used on the USAF Type K-2B flying coveralls, in a cotton poplin textile version. The USAF ERDL coveralls saw some use in SEA from 1967‚Äì69, until replaced by Nomex coveralls in 1970. The U.S. Navy also produced an official ERDL aviation garment in their MIL-C-5390G pattern, produced in a cotton twill textile. These Navy ERDL coveralls saw very limited SEA use from 1967‚Äì68, as their Nomex coveralls were already in use. On unofficial and commercial garments, the ERDL pattern was copied and used by U.S. commercial textile manufacturers in the late 1960s, and applied to various commercial camouflage garments for hunting or unofficial military use. Some commercial ERDL garment examples were made using cotton poplin material, and others were made in the standard rip-stop cotton material. Many commercial ERDL garment examples of the time were made in the pattern mirroring the standard OG-107 fatigue uniforms, with a standard tucked-in shirt, and conventional trousers design. These commercial ERDL OG-107 fatigue-style garments did see some combat use in SEA, such as with U.S. Navy tactical jet aviators in the 1968 timeframe. Some USAF aviators also purchased locally tailor-made ERDL garments for combat and off-duty use. Additionally, some tropical combat uniforms were made by local tailors in the ERDL rip-stop material, which were particularly useful when a classified mission required the use of 'sanitized' or 'sterile' apparel, and equipment.

The game is set in the midst of a war between humans and a world-wide computer intelligence alternately referred to as the N.E.X.U.S. or the Machine. Players take on the roles of humans engaged in the fight against robotic, android, and necrotic minions of the Machine, using technology that is primarily derived from highly advanced biotechnology. The computer intelligence has released a \\"nanobot plague\\" on the world; within a few seconds of a human touching non-precious metal, the item will begin to twist and attack the person, sometimes even animating into a robotic minion of the Machine. The result is that the nanoplague has effectively made non-precious metal allergic to mammalian life.Summary of game on RPG.net, with links to reviews. http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=251 In many ways, this game's mechanics are largely prohibitive to the introduction of characters from other games using the Palladium system (by deliberate design, and presumably to maintain game balance within the game); most conventional technology and weapons from other games simply cannot be used on the world of Splicers, due to the nature of the aforementioned nanoplague, and the Magical and Psionic powers common to most other Palladium modules are greatly reduced in this game setting.  Setting  The world of Splicers is vague as to its location or original name; humans do not know if they are on Earth, or some colony world in space. While much history has been lost in the two hundred years of fighting, they are clear that colony worlds do/did exist. What is known is that humans chose to turn over governance of their world to a computer program, the N.E.X.U.S. (Neurologic Electronic eXecutive and Utility System). Initially, it ran only a few systems, but humans turned over increasing control to it, with increasingly strict (and contradictory) guidelines on its behavior. In a twist reminiscent of the dilemma faced by Hal 9000 in the 2001 series of books, the resulting logic loops leads to the Machine forming several separate personalities, each of whom follows different directives. One of the directives charged the machine with eliminating vermin. Another charged it with environmental protection. Between them, it was concluded that humans are, for all intents and purposes, vermin to be controlled, if not eliminated.RPGnet : Review of Splicers The seven main N.E.X.U.S. personalities each have different agendas based on core tenets of the original programming. One, named Freya, wishes to maintain order within her so-called Ghost Cities, wherein robot duplicates endlessly play out their 'lives' as normal human beings. Another, named Gaia, wishes only to preserve nature, destroying robots that invade nature preserves and 'entertaining' herself with countless experiments in bioengineering. Kali is a destroyer and torturer and murderer (although she wishes to do so in such a way that her \\"fun\\" in matching wits, hunting and torturing the humans never ends); Eve attempts to protect humans and has been seemingly punished by her 'sisters' for doing so; Hecate wishes to only to design and build newer and better war machines, obsessed to such an extent that she actually doesn't care whether or not the humans destroy her previous creations; Ishtar, chief strategist of the Machine, wages unceasing war against the humans and is only kept from completely destroying the species by the intervention of her 'sisters;' and Lilith, a wildcard even within the N.E.X.U.S supercomputer, who is simultaneously playing complex mind games against both the humans and her fellow personalities. In addition to these major personalities, there are dozens (or more) minor personalities that may manifest any traits at all, or may be Lilith or another personality pretending, for their own reasons, to be another. The Machine uses \\"traditional\\" technology, though far advanced from 21st century Earth. It uses a variety of robotic creations, energy weapons, high-velocity rail guns, and missiles. All of these are capable of operating independently, or of being directly controlled by one of the personalities of the Machine. Humans who are part of the resistance live primarily underground, to avoid detection by the Machine, and rely on genetically engineered, or \\"spliced\\", technology to provide for their basic needs, as metal-based technology, owing to the nanobot plague, is denied them. Most of their warriors make use of devices called \\"Host Armor\\", which is, in effect, power armor made out of a specially-tailored living creature. Others are themselves \\"spliced\\", or chemically altered through contact with the fluids surrounding certain genetically engineered creatures. At the current time, the human resistance has arranged itself into Great Houses, which are headed by Warlords (a non-pejorative term). Only the Great House of Barren Marsh is detailed in the Splicers RPG, though additional material can be found in Palladium's sourcebook series, the Rifter. Non-resistant humans live in \\"retro-villages\\", which are maintained by the Machine in accordance with some of its directives. Human technology is reliant upon a group known as the Engineers. These are humans who have bonded with giant, immobile, alien organisms that give them the ability to manipulate genetic codes. Other creatures, known as Librarians, are capable of creating new genetic codes from scratch.  Characters and system adaptations  Splicers is a mega-damage setting, which is to say that the majority of weapons used are of such power that unarmored humans are instantly killed. As such, the game presents only \\"heroic\\" scale characters, who fall into three general categories: those who make use of genetic technology, but remain human themselves, those who have been made inhuman by genetic technology, and Technojackers. The first group are arguably those who are viewed the most heroically by the society in which they are. They are granted powerful weapons of war by the Engineers, and include the Archangel (air cavalry), Dreadguard (heavy infantry/special forces), Outrider (cavalry, on genetically modified War Mounts), Packmasters (K-9 troops) and Roughnecks (infantry). The second group is viewed with a mixture of loathing and admiration. They have become very obviously inhuman, and as such, have difficulties interacting with the very people they are fighting to save. These classes include the Biotic (condemned criminals who have been enhanced by splicer technology), the Saint (a human who has become a living incubator for the creature that creates Engineers), and the Scarecrow (who drinks the fluid surrounding a Librarian, thereby becoming a superhuman addict, under the command of that Librarian). The final group consists of a single class, the Technojackers. These are humans who are not only immune to the nanobot plague, but can control the nanobots inside them to take over robots used by the Machine if placed in very close proximity to them. This means that they can use metal items without fear, but also that humans do not entirely trust them. Splicers does several things that are unique from other Palladium games. First is the assignation of skills. Rather than a set list by class, each class has one or several skill programs that it receives and may choose from. Thus, characters of the same class may have wildly different skill sets if, for example, one chooses to concentrate on Intelligence while another concentrates on weapons or medical skills. It is also one of the few Palladium games that does not include psychic or magical powers in the game, focusing instead entirely on biotechnology (though the powers of the Saint come close, and one could make an argument for Clarke's third law applying to much of the biotechnology).

He played for the NC State Wolfpack football program from 2003 to 2006, handling punts, kickoffs, field goals, and extra points. He also set an all-time NC State record by converting 76 consecutive extra points and also set the school's single-season record with 2,968 punting yards in 2006. Early years A Georgia native, Deraney played football at Fayetteville County High School. College career Deraney played college football as a punter and place-kicker for the NC State Wolfpack football program who redshirted in 2002 and played from 2003 to 2006. He was described as \\"a one-man special-teams show\\" and a \\"triple threat\\", handling punts, field goals, and kickoffs for the Wolfpack. He was one of only 10 players nationally to handle all three kicking functions in 2004, and one of only eight to do so in 2006. In 2005, the Blue Ribbon Football Yearbook declared Deraney \\"the most irreplaceable player on the Wolfpack roster.\\" On kickoffs, Deraney was known for the high percentage of his kickoffs that went for touchbacks. As a punter, he kicked 208 times for 8,366 yards, an average of 40.2 yards per punt and downed 61 punts inside the 20-yard line. On field goals, he converted 40 of 58 attempts. He also converted 84 of 85 extra points and totaled 199 points during his four seasons at NC State. His total of 40 field goals ranked fourth in NC State history when he left the program (ranks seventh currently). He also set NC State records by converting 76 consecutive extra points and tallying 2,968 punting yards in a single season in 2006. Prior to his 2006 redshirt senior season, Deraney's father, who suffered from multiple sclerosis, was placed in hospice care and given six months to live. Deraney continued to kick through the 2006 season, converting 12 of 16 field goals and 22 of 23 extra points. Professional football In the spring of 2007, he was signed as an undrafted free agent punter by the Detroit Lions. His playing career was derailed by a torn ACL and meniscus in his left knee during the Lions' first preseason. In 2010, after extensive physical therapy and training, Deraney attempted a comeback, but he was not picked up by an NFL team.

Like an opaque projector, a document camera is able to magnify and project the images of actual, three- dimensional objects, as well as transparencies.. They are, in essence, high resolution web cams, mounted on arms so as to facilitate their placement over a page. This allows a teacher, lecturer or presenter to write on a sheet of paper or to display a two or three-dimensional object while the audience watches. Theoretically, all objects can be displayed by a document camera. Most objects are simply placed under the camera. The camera takes the picture which in turn produces a live picture using a projector or monitor. Different types of document camera/visualizer allow great flexibility in terms of placement of objects. Larger objects, for example, can simply be placed in front of the camera and the camera rotated as necessary,or a ceiling mounted document camera can also be used to allow a larger working area to be used. Uses Typical * Lecture hall or classroom use * Presentation of material in conferences, meetings and training sessions * Videoconferencing and telepresence * Presentation of evidence in courtrooms * Various medical applications (telemedicine, telepathology, display of x-rays) Document cameras replaced epidiascopes and overhead projectors, which were formerly used for this purpose. By means of the zoom feature a document camera can enlarge the small print in books and project a printed page as if it were a traditional transparency. Also, the room lighting does not have to be darkened to operate a document camera; in a classroom setting this is an asset.. Most document cameras can also send a video signal to a computer via USB cable. Sometimes document cameras are connected to an interactive whiteboard instead of a standard screen. Some document cameras can be supplied with an accessory so that they can be used with a microscope. , camera sensors in document cameras are mostly providing either 720pHD (1280x720 pixels) or 1080pHD (1920x1080 pixels) native image resolution.  History  Video Lupe 1974, manufactured by Wolf Audio Visuals - document camera prototype model Video Loop (Wolf Audio Visuals) AV installation c. 1975 - prototype document camera ELMO releases its first Visualiser EV-308 Document cameras were developed to meet an increased demand for the ability to project and present original documents, plans, drawings and objects directly, rather than necessitating the prior preparation, that would be required for their use as part of an overhead projector based presentation. The first Visualizer/document camera were developed by the companies WolfVision and Elmo and were launched at the photokina Trade Fair in 1988.http://www.wolfvision.com/visualizer/index.php/en/company-1/history The widespread use of computers, projectors, and popular presentation programs such as Microsoft PowerPoint in meeting rooms, meant that overhead projectors became less frequently used. Document cameras continue to provide a convenient and flexible way of allowing documents, books or slides to be spontaneously displayed during presentations as required. The first attempts and prototypes were mostly simple video cameras on a copy stand. During the mid-1970s these were assembled and equipped with additional lighting to ensure that they were able to operate in darkened rooms, and also to provide a consistent quality of projected image. The technology of video cameras during this time, was a key factor in the development of document camera systems. Document cameras have also frequently benefited from developments in other industries, which also facilitated significant advances in the field of document camera technology. A good example of this is the technology used in photographic equipment, which has contributed much to the development of the document camera as a high quality presentation tool. At the end of the 1990s progressive scan cameras were introduced. Many visualizers available on the market today are capable of at least 30 frames per second output, which ensures high quality imaging and smoothness of motion in all resolutions and aspect ratios. Technology The design and specification of a document camera are a combination of several different technologies. The quality of the recorded image is dependent on the primary components, which are: optics, camera, lighting system and motherboard with appropriate firmware (software). The finished product is then realised by the production of different mechanical designs by individual manufacturers. Today High-Definition Document cameras are available with HDMI output, Audio/Video recording and playback is possible, and some High-Definition document cameras are also using high-speed WIFI technology to eliminate the need for cables.  Optics  Optics are one of the most critical components relating to image quality, and the quality of the optical system used will largely depend on the planned cost of the device. Simple or highly complex optical systems can be used, which can differ significantly in both quality and size. The iris or aperture is another important component of the optics. The iris controls and regulates the amount of light that passes through the lens onto the image sensor. A lens will focus on exactly one point of an object to be imaged onto the sensor. However, there is also an area in front of and behind the point of focus that will be perceived as being in sharp focus by the human eye. This is called the depth of field, and it is dependent upon the size of the iris or aperture. (the smaller the aperture, the greater the depth of field).  Camera  Progressive scan cameras use either CCD sensors or CMOS sensors. The general advantage of progressive scanning over the interlaced method is the much higher resolution that is the result. A progressive scan camera captures all scan lines at the same time, whereas an interlaced camera uses alternating sets of lines. Basically, image sensors provide only monochrome images. With a 1-chip camera, colour information can be easily obtained through the use of colour filters over each pixel. With 1-chip cameras, the so-called Bayer filter is very common. Red, green and blue filters are arranged in a pattern. The number of green pixels is twice as large as that of the blue and red, thus the higher sensitivity and resolution of the human eye is replicated. To get a colour image, different algorithms are then used to interpolate the missing colour information. A 3CCD camera module is another way to produce colour images. A prism is used to split white light into its red, green and blue components and a separate sensor is then used for each colour. This complex camera technology is used in 3-chip cameras and allows for excellent colour reproduction at very high resolutions. Modern camera systems used in a document camera are able to provide high-resolution colour images at 30 frames per second. In a 3-chip camera, the measured resolution may be up to 1500 lines. In addition the image can be adapted to fit common display aspect ratios of 4:3, 16:9 and 16:10.  Lighting system  Lighting is an essential part of a document camera. To ensure good colour rendition, the lighting system used to illuminate the image capture area should be as uniform as possible. The greater the light intensity, the more independent the document camera is from ambient light sources. Using powerful lighting systems enables smaller apertures to be used, and this in turn provides a significant increase in the depth of field that can be achieved by the document camera. Also the higher the quality of the light source, the more light that will reach the camera sensor, and this results in less noticeable noise, and therefore the quality of image is not degraded. Some document camera models integrate additional functionality into the light system, such as a synchronized light field that clearly indicates to the user at all times, by way of an illuminated image capture area or laser markers, the size and position of the imaging area, which adjusts simultaneously as the lens zooms in or out.  Motherboard and firmware  The motherboard plays an important role in image processing and it has a major influence on the quality of the eventual image that is produced. Larger and larger resolutions and high refresh rates generate large amounts of data that must be processed in real- time. Document cameras have a wide variety of sophisticated automated systems that are designed to make the user experience as easy as possible. Permanent autofocus detection, for example, automatically adjusts the focus settings when a new object is displayed, with no need for user intervention. Other important features include automatic auto iris, auto exposure, auto white balance and automatic gain control. A document camera needs an image display device to show the information to the audience. Modern motherboards have a variety of connections to ensure flexibility of use. In addition to HDMI, DVI, VGA ports for connecting to displays, (projectors, monitors and video conferencing systems) there are also several interfaces provided to facilitate connection to a computer or interactive whiteboard. These interfaces are most commonly USB, Network (LAN) and serial. In addition, an external PC or laptop can be connected to the document camera to allow for switching between a Power Point presentation and a live demonstration. Some models can also handle external storage devices and play files directly from a USB flash drive, or save images taken during the presentation onto it. Some document camera manufacturers also provide for regular firmware upgrades, allowing users to have the opportunity to be equipped with, and benefit from new features as they become available. Document camera types Document cameras are generally divided into three groups. Smaller lightweight models are considered portable, larger sturdier and more stable units are known as desktop models, and the third group are ceiling visualizers. These are designed to be ceiling mounted above a tabletop or podium.  Portable and desktop models  Portable and desktop models allow a similar working environment to that of an overhead projector. Many document camera users appreciate the added flexibility in terms of the variety of objects that can be displayed to an audience. Portable devices can be used in multiple locations without requiring any prior special installation.  Ceiling models  Ceiling Visualizer in use in a typical Telepresence installation Ceiling-mounted document cameras/visualizers are a variation from the traditional desktop models and allow for larger objects to be displayed. There is no desktop technical equipment to restrict the views of speaker and audience, as the technology is installed unobtrusively in the ceiling. Ceiling models are often used to support videoconferencing or telepresence systems to further enhance the immersive experience for participants.

Bonifaci, Bonifatz, or Bonifacio Calvo (fl. 1253-1266) was a Genoese troubadour of the late thirteenth century. The only biographical account of (part of) his life is found in the vida of Bertolome Zorzi. He is, however, the most notable Genoese troubadour after Lanfranc Cigala.Egan, 16. In total, nineteen of his poemsFour cansos, one planh, and fourteen sirventes. and two descorts have survived.Keller, 145. Bonifaci is known to have spent most of his career at the court of Alfonso X of Castile, where the prevailing language was Galician-Portuguese.Cabr√©, 128. He wrote primarily in Occitan, concentrating on sirventes in imitation of Bertran de Born, but he did take up the court language and wrote two cantigas de amor and a multilingual poem. He wrote one sirventes encouraging Alfonso to go to war with Henry III of England over Gascony, an event which provides a reliable date for the work's composition (1253-1254). Outside of sirventes, he composed love songs in the style of Arnaut Daniel, but his most lauded work is a planh on the death of his lady. The notion that Bonifaci had been knighted by Ferdinand III of Castile and fell in love with Ferdinand's niece Berenguela, which inspired him to compose in Galician-Portuguese, is legendary, being based on an unreliable passage of Jean de Nostredame.Lang, 105 n24. In 1266 Bonifaci returned to Lombardy. He continued composing in Occitan, producing two descorts with Scotto and Luquet Gattulus. During a war between Genoa and Venice, Bonifaci composed a sirventes, \\"Ges no m'es greu, s'ieu non sui ren prezatz\\" (It matters little to me if I am not esteemed), in which he blamed the Genoese for allowing themselves to be defeated the Venetians and insulting the latter. In response, Bertolome Zorzi, a Venetian prisoner of war, wrote \\"Molt me sui fort d'un chant mer[a]veillatz\\" (I was very much surprised by a song), defending his country's conduct and blaming Genoa for the war. According to Bertolome's vida, Bonifaci was convinced by Bertolome's poem and the two became friends. They composed many tensos together.Egan, 15.

Since 1804 it has been the residence of British governors and governors-general and Sri Lankan presidents, having been known as the \\"King's House\\" or the \\"Queen's House\\" until Sri Lanka became a republic in 1972. There have been 29 governors who resided here, and also six presidents who resided or used it in an official capacity. Currently it is used by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the President of Sri Lanka for state functions. The Presidential Secretariat functions as the office of the president, with much of the presidential staff based there. History Dutch period The last Dutch governor, Johan van Angelbeek, built a two-storied residence on the site of the demolished St Francis's Church, which had been built by the Portuguese in the 16th century. British period It was sold to the British colonial administration by Angelbeek's granddaughter on January 17, 1804 for ¬£10,000, to set off deficits incurred by her husband George Melvin Leslie, the revenue officer British Governor Fedrick North. After the British took over the house, it became the official residence of the Governor of Ceylon known as Government House but most commonly referred to as the King's House or the Queen's House depending on the monarch of the time. Post-independence Since independence in 1948 the house became the official residence of the Governor General of Ceylon. It was formally renamed as the President's House in 1972 after Sri Lanka became a republic. William Gopallawa was the last governor general and first President of Sri Lanka to reside at the house. The Jayawardene reconstruction In the 1980s and 1990s the house underwent refurbishments under the direction of one of Sri Lanka's foremost architects Geoffrey Bawa.Geoffrey Bawa: a valediction for a colossus The Rajapaksha reconstruction It was once again refurbished in 2000s with the addition of an underground bunker.Underground palace at President‚Äôs House Gordon Gardens Set in about of land, the residence gained further attraction when Governor Sir Arthur Hamilton Gordon laid out the Gordon Gardens at his own expense in honour of Queen Victoria's golden jubilee celebrations in 1887. The Gardens boast a variety of trees. A marble statue of Queen Victoria was removed from the gardens in 2006. Gordon Gardens was open to the public until 1980, when it was made part of the President's House; it is now off-limits to the public. The site was the location for the 1881 Royal‚ÄìThomian. Kilometre Zero In Sri Lanka, all distances from Colombo are measured, formally, in miles, from the President's House. This practice began with the construction of the Colombo-Kandy road in 1830, which was the first modern highway in the island. Since then, most of the highways originate from Colombo. Public access and security The King's House had limited opening to the public until the early part of the 20th century. Only colonial officers were allowed access to the governor when in residence. Closure of Janadhipathi Mawatha Since independence, the Queen's House as it was known remained accessible in many ways. Gordon Gardens remain open as a public park. In times of emergencies access was limited and the Queen's Road was closed off. In peacetime these were open once again, until 1980, when Gordon Gardens were taken over to the President's House. Following the Central Bank bombing the Janadhipathi Mawatha (formally Queen's Road) was permanently closed off for vehicular traffic up to Old Colombo Lighthouse and further extended to Bank of Ceylon Mawatha. It was reopened in early 2015, and in June 2016 the President's House was opened to the public for a week. Protection A permanent guard of colonial troops was provided since 18th century which originated the colonial title of Mudaliar of the Governor's Gate. By the 20th century, the Governor's Guard was located in the basement of the GPO Building located opposite the King's House. In 1979, the Sri Lanka Corps of Military Police formed the President's Ceremonial Guard Company at the President's House to perform ceremonial guard duties, such as Guard Mounting. At present the President's House is protected by the President's Security Division.

It was established in 1926 at Intramuros, Manila. On June 2, 2008, the Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) and Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd) programs of the College were proclaimed Center of Excellence (COE) in Education by the Commission on Higher Education. Likewise, the Department of Education designated it as a Center of Training (COT) The different degree programs of the College are accredited by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA). In the academic year 2011-2012, the BSEd and BEEd programs have been granted Level III accreditation status. In 2013, the BSFT and BSND programs have been granted Level III re-accredited status. The BLIS program has also been granted Candidate accreditation status last academic year 2014-2015. The College is a top performing school in the board examinations for teachers, nutritionist- dietitians and librarians. History of the College The U.S.T. College of Education was founded in June 1926 during the rectorate of Very Rev. Fr. Manuel Arellano, O.P. Classes at the college commenced in Intramuros, Manila. It offered the four-year Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S.E.) degree. In 1940, the normal school was established and offered a two-year course leading to Elementary Teachers Certificate (E.T.C.). In 1941, the Elementary Training Department was opened as a laboratory school of the College of Education. In 1953, the degree Bachelor of Science in Home Economics (B.S.H.E.) was offered. In June 1954, the Elementary Teachers Certificate was changed into a four-year degree called Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. From 1955-1957, a new major in Food and Nutrition was added; and later transformed into Bachelor of Science in Foods and Nutrition (B.S.F.N.). In the school year 1970-71, the Institute of Nutrition was established as an independent body from the College of Education under the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs. Another significant event in 1971 was the merging of the Normal School with the College of Education due to the decreasing enrollment rate of the former. In July 1971, a Special Assistant to the Dean was created to take charge of the Normal elementary School since the Directress and the Secretary of the School positions were abolished. From 1974-1976, the College offered new major studies in Chemistry and in School Guidance & Character Education. The latter major replaced the co-major in Theology. The College introduced the following terminal courses to meet the demands for manpower: Certificate in Practical Arts (2 years),Certificate in Practical Dietetics (2 years) and Tourist Guide Certificate (1 year). The two former courses/programs were later on phased out while the Tourist Guide Certificate was changed into Associate in Tourism (2 years). In the 1980s, the College of Education phased out all vocational courses/programs and the Institute of Nutrition was abolished. Later on, the College offered the following four-year degree programs: Bachelor of Science in Tourism, Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, and Bachelor of Science in Hotel & Restaurant Management. From 1990-1992, new majors for the Bachelor of Secondary Education program were offered: Computer Technology Education; Home Management and Vocational Technology (which replaced Home Economics); and Values Education (which replaced the Guidance and Character Education). The Early Childhood Education was also introduced as a new major for the Bachelor of Elementary Education program. In the School Year 2006-07, the B.S. Tourism and B.S. Hotel and Restaurant Management programs were transferred into a newly established body of the University - the Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management (I.T.H.M.). The I.T.H.M. was later renamed as College of Tourism and Hospitality Management. In 2004, the College collaborated with Hanyang University (South Korea) for a student-exchange program. In 2007, the College was the second top performing school in the nutrition-dietetics board exam with a passing rate of 80%, higher than the national passing rate of 56.40%. Four Thomasians entered the Top Ten Examinees of the said P.R.C. examination. In the April 2008 Licensure Examination for Teachers (Secondary Level), the College was the second top performing school with a high 95% passing rate. Two Thomasian BSEd alumni entered the Top Ten Examinees' list. In the school year 2008-09, the Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) and the Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd) programs have been granted the Center of Excellence (COE) status after undergoing the stringent evaluation of the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd). The COE status lasted from June 2, 2008 until June 2, 2011. In 2008, the Department of Education (DepEd) designated the College as a Center of Training (COT) in MAPEH. Since then, DepEd and U.S.T. College of Education have been collaborating for the annual Teacher Induction Program (T.I.P.) for the public school teachers. In April 2009, Asst. Prof. Leonila Wilhelmina N. Baltazar of the Department of Biological and General Sciences landed 8th place in the LET Secondary Level. Two other Thomasian BSEd graduates were also among the Top 10. In the November 2010 board exam for librarians, Kristi Ma Fevie Villapando Macasaet garnered the 9th Place with the score 85.10%. In the September 2011 Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET), the College was the number one school for the Elementary Level with the highest passing rate of 97.59% (81 out of 83 Thomasians passed). On the other hand, it was the fourth top performing school in the Secondary Level with a passing rate of 88.26% (218 out of 247 examinees passed). The national passing rate for LET Elementary Level was 22.68% and 31.45% for LET Secondary Level. Asst. Prof. Erlyn M. Geronimo, a faculty member of the College and a supervising teacher of the Education High School, landed 1st Place in the exam with a percentage score of 87.80%. In November 2011, the Bachelor of Elementary Education and Bachelor of Secondary Education programs of the College achieved Level III PACUCOA (Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation) accreditation. In July 2012 board exam for nutritionists and dietitians, U.S.T. was declared as the second top-performing school with 93 out of 99 examinees who passed (93.94% passing rate). Three Thomasians made it to the Top 10 Examinees' list namely: Hannah Paulyn Yu Co (1st Place - 87.00%), Patricia Alyanna Gerona Cardoza (3rd Place - 85.05%),and Kevin Estrera Carpio (4th Place - 84.95%). In September 2012, U.S.T. was recognized by the Professional Regulation Commission as a top performing school in the elementary and secondary education levels. In the Elementary Level, U.S.T. was the SECOND TOP PERFORMING SCHOOL with 136 out of 138 examinees who passed the exam (98.55% overall passing rate). Likewise, U.S.T. was the NUMBER ONE SCHOOL on the list of THE TOP PERFORMING SCHOOLS in the Secondary Level with 160 out of 166 new Thomasian high school teachers (96.39% overall passing rate). In November 2012, U.S.T. was one of the 3 top performing schools in the November 2012 Librarian Board Exam with 31 out of 38 Thomasians who passed the test (81.58% passing rate).

Roberto Stagno (; 18 October 1840 [some sources give 1836 as his birth year] - 26 April 1897) was a prominent Italian opera tenor. He became an important interpreter of verismo music when it burst on to the operatic scene during the 1890s; but he also possessed an agile bel canto technique which he employed in operas dating from earlier periods. In 1890, he created the pivotal verismo role of Turiddu. Career Stagno (real name Vincenzo Andrioli) was born in Palermo, Sicily, into a family with connections to the minor nobility. He studied in Milan in Northern Italy and made his operatic debut in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1862. His career breakthrough came three years later, however, when he substituted successfully for Italy's most celebrated dramatic tenor, Enrico Tamberlik, in a Madrid performance of Robert le diable. During the next three decades, Stagno performed in a variety of operas at major opera houses in Spain, Italy, France and Russia, building and then consolidating his reputation as one of Europe's leading tenors. Stagno was popular, too, in Argentina, where he appeared initially in 1879, and he also performed for one entire season (1883‚Äì84) in the United States, at the New York Metropolitan Opera where he sang leading roles in the company premieres of several core works of the Italian repertory including Il trovatore, I puritani, Rigoletto, and La Gioconda. Unfortunately for Stagno, his time in New York was to prove shorter than he would have liked: American audiences expressed reservations about his singing because of its pronounced and persistent vibrato. He resumed his career in Italy and South America where his vocal method was more appreciated. Then, in Rome, on 17 May 1890, he made operatic history when he created the role of Turiddu at the first performance of Mascagni's enduringly popular and highly influential one-act verismo work, Cavalleria rusticana. His common-law wife, the soprano Gemma Bellincioni, sang opposite him in the role of Santuzza. (They had met at sea while travelling to Buenos Aires in 1886 with a troupe of singers.) Their daughter, Bianca Stagno-Bellincioni (1888‚Äì1980), was a singer and actress. In 1945, she published a book about her parents. Stagno was only 57 when he died in Genoa of combined renal and cardiac ailments. No recordings survive of his voice, which was lyric-dramatic in size and said to have had a warm, vibrant if tremulous timbre. Of those early tenors who did record, Fernando De Lucia (1860‚Äì1925) was perhaps the most similar to Stagno in sound and style. De Lucia, although trained in the \\"old school\\", as was Stagno, likewise became renowned in the 1890s as an interpreter of verismo roles.

Its ownership passed through several prominent British administrators and traders. It was owned between 1830-1834 by John Walbeoff of the British Civil Service, who headed the Cinnamon Department of Ceylon. Christopher Elliott M.D.the Principal Medical Officer in Ceylon bought the house in 1848. He was also the proprietor and editor of the 'Colombo Observer'. During the Matale Rebellion it was the focal point for the public campaign against the excesses of Governor Torrington. In 1856 it was sold to John Philip Green who named it \\"Temple Trees\\" in 1856 for the temple trees that grew around the bungalow.WINTER - Family The house was purchased by the British Government of Ceylon and became the residence of the Colonial Secretary.

Temple Trees has taken centre stage in many episodes of modern Sri Lankan history. During the 1962 Ceylonese coup d'√©tat attempt by senior police and reservist military officers, Temple Trees was the prime target. The armoured cars stationed there were withdrawn to facilitate a take over by troops of the Ceylon Artillery. However the coup was thwarted by the Police CID and internal security detail of the Royal Ceylon Navy took up guard of Temple Trees. The coup leaders were later brought to Temple Trees for questioning. It once again it became a refuge for Sirimavo Bandaranaike when she was rushed there on the night of April 4, 1971 after an assassination plot was uncovered, to be carried out at her private residence at Rosmead Place, at the outset of the 1971 JVP Insurrection. Many cabinet ministers also took refuge at Temple Trees during the early days of the insurrection. It soon became the primary command center for all military operations against the insurrection. Since the 1970s, Temple Trees has been heavily guarded with many roads around the mansion and its grounds closed off due to the Sri Lankan Civil War. Temple Trees has been the official residence of all United National Party Prime Ministers of Sri Lanka.

History Honorius, depicted on the consular diptych of Anicius Petronius Probus (406, Museo del tesoro della cattedrale di Aosta, ) The diocese of Aosta was founded no earlier than the 5th century.Duchesne, p. 247: Il est peu probable que l'√©v√™ch√© d'Aoste remonte plus haut que le Ve si√®cle. At that time it was a suffragan of the diocese of Milan.Kehr, p. 158. On 13 June 867, Pope Nicholas I made it was a suffragan of the Archbishop of Vienne,Frutaz, p. 6. and it is known that in the 11th century it was a suffragan of the diocese of Tarentaise, a province created between 794 and 811.Frutaz, p. 6. C. 1183 Archbishop Aymon of Tarentaise engaged in an arbitration between Bishop Guigo of Aosta and the Collegiate Church of S. Omer: Duc, Cartulaire, pp. 203-204. Frutaz, p. 284, cites a pair of bulls of Pope Alexander III of 1172 and 1176 which confirm the metropolitan status of Tarentaise. It then became subject to Milan again, but was restored to Tarentaise. The diocese of Aosta was suppressed by order of the Emperor Napoleon I, in 1802, an order which was given canonical effect by Pius VII in 1803.Duchesne, p. 247. Kehr, p. 158. Although Ursus is sometimes said to have been the first bishop, this is controverted.Savio, pp. 70-71. Lanzoni, pp. 1052-1053. The first known bishop is St. Eustasius, whose name coupled with Aosta is signed to a letter sent to Pope Leo I by the second Synod of Milan in 451.. Savio, p. 72: Ego Gratus presbyter, directus ab episcopo meo Eustasio ecclesiae Augustanae, vice ipsius in omnia suprascripta consensi et subscripsi. In the cathedral treasury is a consular diptych of Anicius Petronius Probus, Roman consul in 406, which shows the Emperor Honorius. (It was discovered in 1833.) From the ninth century the list of bishops is fairly complete.Compare Frutaz, pp. 13-14, who states that from the beginning of the diocese to the beginning of the 11th century, only eight names of bishops are known, which he lists and annotates. Bernard of Menthon (1008), Archdeacon of Aosta, founded the hospice on the Alps named after him, as a relief to pilgrims. In the 10th and early 11th centuries, the bishops of Aosta ruled the surrounding country as its secular counts. The two titles were separated at or following the death of Bishop Anselm of Aosta, in 1026, owing to Conrad II's desire to strengthen his position near the important Little St Bernard Pass and distrust of Burchard, Anselm's successor and a relative of various nobles opposed to Conrad's claims in Burgundy. (Burchard subsequently rose in a revolt, which failed; he was later translated to Lyons.) His namesake, Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury (1033‚Äì1109), was also a native of Aosta and probably related to its dynasty of bishops; however, rather than remain in local service, he travelled to Bec Abbey in Normandy and ultimately became primate over Norman England instead. In 1133, Bishop Herbert, with the consent of the Provost and Canons of the Collegiate Church of S. Ursi (Ours), converted the Chapter of secular canons into an association of Canons Regular of S. Augustine. This change had the support and authority of Pope Innocent II behind it. The first Prior of the Canons of S. Ours was Arnulphus, who later became Bishop of Aosta.Duc, Esquisses, pp. 7-10. Kehr, p. 163. Two of his Canons, Aimon de Quart and Walbert, later became bishops of Aosta as well.Duc, Esquisses, p. 11. In 1134 Bishop Herbert granted the Canons the free administration of their goods, releasing them from episcopal control.Duc, Esquisses, pp. 12-14. In 1135 Innocent II conceded the Canons of S. Ours the right of burial and the right to elect their own Prior. This was confirmed by Pope Lucius II in 1144, and Pope Eugene III in 1146.Kehr, p. 163 nos. 3, 4, and 5. Jean-Antoine Gal, L' insigne coll√©giale de S. Pierre et de S. Ours d'Aoste (Aoste 1864). In the Spring of 1536, John Calvin, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino, and he was forced to flee. Following the Concordat of 1801 between Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII, the Pope issued a bull, Gravissimis causis (1 June 1803), in which the number of dioceses in Piedmont was reduced to eight: Turin, Vercelli, Ivrea, Acqui, Asti, Mondovi, Alessandria and Saluzzo. Ivrea was united with the former diocese of Aosta. Bishop Paolo Giuseppe Solaro di Villanova resigned, so as not to impede the operation of the Bull.Frutaz, p. 322. The diocese of Aosta was re-established in 1817 by Pope Pius VII in his bull, Beati Petri (17 July 1817).Bullarii Romani continuatio, VII, pp. 1490-1503, ¬ß 20. Synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. John Paul II, Constitutio Apostolica de Synodis Dioecesanis Agendis (19 March 1997): Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89 (1997), pp. 706-727. Bishop Simon de Duin issued a set of Statutes for the diocese in 1280. They are concerned mostly with the administration of the sacraments and the proper conduct of clerics.Duc, Esquisses, pp. 290-291. A diocesan synod was held by Bishop Emeric in 1307; the Statutes issued at that time have survived. In the diocese the sacrament of Baptism was practiced by immersion rather than by sprinkling of water.J.-A. Duc, Documents relatifs √† l'√©piscopat du Bienheureux Emeric I. de Quart, √©v√©que d'Aoste, Aosta 1879. Duc, Esquisses, pp. 291-305. Bishop Ogerius Moriset (1411‚Äì1433) held a synod on 9 May 1424.

Bishop Andr√© Jourdain (1832‚Äì1859) presided over a diocesan synod held on 27‚Äì29 August 1835.Constitutions et instructions synodales du dioc√™se d'Aoste (Aoste: P. A. Ibertis 1836). Bishop Joseph Auguste Duc (1872‚Äì1907) held his first synod on 21 August 1874, his second in 1875, his third in 1876, and his sixth in September 1880.Statuta synodalia dioecesis Augustensis edita ab ill.mo et rev.mo D.D.

Cathedral and Chapter The cathedral of the Assumption in Aosta was served by a Chapter of regular clergy, presumably following the Rule of Saint Benedict until (perhaps) the second half of the 9th century, when the monastic discipline seems to have been relaxed; in 1133, under Bishop Humbertus, the rule of the Canons Regular was adopted.De Tillier, p. 74. Joseph Auguste Duc, (1879), \\"Le Chapitre de la cath√©drale d'Aoste a-t-il √©t√© autrefois r√©gulier?\\" In: , at p. 70. Bishop Humbertus was encouraged by Pope Innocent II, who was under the reforming influence of Bernard of Clairvaux. The Chapter consisted of two dignities, the Provost and the Archdeacon, and twenty Canons. One of the Canons served as Theologus. There were also fifty-two Perpetual Chaplains and six choir boys (called the Innocentes). A twenty-first Canon was added on 14 September 1721, through the generosity of Father Jean-Baptiste du Chatelard, Prior Commendatory of the Cathedral.De Tillier, Historique, p. 67. After the death of the donor, the right of nomination to the canonry was transferred to the Chapter. By 1743 there were twenty-three Canons.Saint- Marthe, Gallia christiana XII, p. 805. Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 104 note 1; VI, p. 106 note 1. In the filling of vacancies in the Chapter, an unusual system was followed. In the first month of each season of the year, the Pope had the right of appointment; in the second month of each season, the Bishop enjoyed the right; in the third month, the Chapter. This system lasted down until the administration of Bishop Filiberto Alberto Bailly (1659‚Äì1691), who traded his right to nominate in February, May, August, and November to the Pope, in exchange for the right to appoint to the cures in his diocese.De Tillier, Historique, p. 73-74. Bishops of Aosta to 1200 * Eustasius (c. 451 ?)Eustatius did not attend the provincial council of Milan under Bishop Eusebius in 451, but sent instead a priest named Gratus to represent him. Savio, pp. 71-72. Lanzoni, p. 1053. * Gratus (c. 470)Savio, pp. 72-74, points out that there is nothing but conjecture that identifies Bishop Gratus with the priest Gratus of the council of Milan of 451. Gratus is patron saint of the diocese. Lanzoni, pp. 1053-1055. Duchesne, p. 247, accepts the identification of the priest Gratus with the Bishop. * Jucundus (501, 502)Bishop Jucundus took part in the Councils of Rome in 501 and 502. Duchesne, p. 248. Savio, pp. 76-77, believes that he was the Bishop Jocundus who received a letter from Pope Gelasius I in 496. Lanzoni, p. 1055, rejects the attribution, believing that he was a suffragan bishop of Rome. Around 507‚Äì511 King Theodosius wrote to the Bishop of Milan that the Bishop of Aosta was not guilty of the charge of treason laid against him; Lanzoni believes that this bishop could be Jucundus. * Gallus (528‚Äì546)Diocesi di Aosta: Parrocchie di San Lorenzo in Aosta : [Ploceanus] (late sixth century?)Ploceanus is known from the fantastic hagiographical life of Saint Ursus (Orso), written in the 11th century (Savio, p. 78). Gams, p. 828, ignores him, as does Duchesne, 248. Lanzoni, p. 1056, questions him. He is said to have been an Arian who, according to the legend of Saint Ursus of Aosta, was strangled in his bed by two devils: Sant' Orso di Aosta * Rathbornus (c. 876 ‚Äì 877)Rathbornus took part in the recognition of Charles the Bald as King of Italy, at Pavia in 876.

The editors of Mansi point out that the knowledge of the council of Milan depends entirely on the report of Ughelli, who says nothing about his source(s). Ughelli's reported dates are confused and impossible. Savio, p. 86. * Anselmus (c. 990 ‚Äì 14 January 1026)Bishop Anselm was present at the Council of Ansa (diocese of Lyon), held under the presidency of Burchardus, Archbishop of Lyoon, in 990: Mansi, XIX, pp. 99-100.

Though it embraces certain tenets based in Eastern philosophy, OneTaste's central focus is female orgasm and sexuality, especially in a practice called Orgasmic Meditation. The organization has often been criticized for its cult-like operations, similar to Lafayette Morehouse, which influenced Daedone.  History  OneTaste was cofounded in San Francisco by Robert Kandell and Nicole Daedone in 2001. OneTaste originally operated two communal-style \\"urban retreat\\" centers, one in San Francisco's Soma District and the other on Manhattan's Lower East Side. OneTaste produces media, workshops, weekend retreats, and a coach training program. A \\"Buddhist Monk\\" supposedly introduced orgasmic meditation to Daedone before she started OneTaste. The New York Times portrays Daedone as leading a self-described \\"slow sex movement, one that places a near-exclusive emphasis on women‚Äôs pleasure ‚Äî in which love, romance and even flirtation are not required.\\" Daedone draws parallels between slow sex and the Slow Food movement associated with chef Alice Waters. With sex as with food, she says, people can overindulge without getting nourishment, or go from one extreme of consuming mindlessly to the other extreme of self-denial. In 2014 OneTaste received Inc. 5000 Honors for Top Health companies.  Description  The organization's stated goal is \\"to create a clean, well-lit place where sexuality, relationship, and intimacy could be discussed openly and honestly.\\" OneTaste produces media, workshops, weekend retreats, and a coach training program. Orgasmic meditation (OM) is a mindfulness practice in which the object of meditation is finger to genital contact. OM is practiced in pairs, with one practitioner stroking the genitals of the other, and both focusing their attention on the sensation with the stated goal of developing connective resonance between them. Although the practitioners can be of either sex, the focus of orgasmic meditation seems to be on the female orgasm through subtle and deliberate stimulation of the clitoris. Both partners, however, are said to share in the sensation and fulfillment via a kind of \\"pleasure by proxy.\\" Proponents state that orgasmic meditation encompasses more than just orgasm and that it encourages greater emotional awareness, connected relationships, and sense of fulfillment. Others describe the sensation as \\"a heady buzz, mixed with equal parts wooziness and intensity of focus.\\" Orgasmic Meditation borrows from other traditions including yoga, and other forms of meditation, and is a central element of the \\"Slow Sex Movement\\". Practitioners of orgasmic meditation claim the practice nourishes the limbic system, that bit of the mammalian brain for emotion, empathy, and motivation. After, both partners share their experiences, verbally. Controversies OneTaste has drawn international media attention and controversy; several journalists have compared OneTaste to a cult and pyramid scheme, while others have noted a push of orgasmic meditation into the mainstream. In March 2009, The New York Times featured OneTaste on the front page of its \\"Style\\" section. The article describes the organization as \\"the latest stop on this sexual underground, weaving together strands of radical individual freedom, Eastern spirituality and feminism.\\" An Indiana University sociology professor who has studied San Francisco's sexual subcultures, Elizabeth A. Armstrong, is quoted as saying ‚ÄúThe notion of a San Francisco sex commune focused on female orgasm is part of a long and rich history of women being public and empowered about their sexuality.‚Äù The article also notes, \\"as with many a commune before it, the leader of One Taste, Ms. Daedone, is a polarizing personality, whom admirers venerate as a sex diva, although some former members say she has cult like powers over her followers... Much of the community‚Äôs tone revolves around Ms. Daedone, a woman of considerable charm, although detractors regard her as a master manipulator.\\" In the New York Times interview, Ms. Daedone insists she does not aspire to guru status, while acknowledging that \\"there‚Äôs a high potential for this to be a cult.\\" The New York Times article led to several blog and opinion columns. Salon.com ran an essay that referenced the Times piece and discussed the merits of women joining a community dedicated to female orgasm, concluding that \\"within a mainstream sexual culture defined almost exclusively by dudely desires\\" that it might be healthy. A number of press accounts have since offered different perspectives on the organization including a 2013 Gawker article, also referencing online cult accusations, which documented the reporter's experience at a weekend conference hosted by OneTaste. An article in GoodTimes Weekly, 'The Big OM', refers to \\"cult allegations\\" by posters on Yelp.com, as did one on Vice and on Salon. A 2016 episode of the podcast Love + Radio is dedicated to the experience of a woman who had increasingly fraught relations with OneTaste. An article in The Cut stated that \\"some cult experts have linked Daedone with Victor Baranco,\\" the cult leader who ran Lafayette Morehouse, and also suggests that it may be a pyramid scheme. Similarly, an article in The Frisky described OneTaste as \\"Landmark Forum for the clitoris.\\" A Refinery 29 article cited the organization's \\"potentially aggressive sales tactics.\\" Playboy Magazine compared OneTaste to Scientology and Landmark Forum, saying it had a \\"pyramidal pricing structure\\"; a week-long training with Nicole Daedone had been advertised at $36,000. It said: \\"All I can think about is how easy it is to start a cult. .... the way the volunteers serve the leaders, jumping at their every demand to \\"get me water‚Äù and ‚Äúmove that stool‚Äù... the full-court sales pitch from the minute you walk in... I leave early and I'm furious\\". The author implies she was gaslighted when she disagreed with the leaders. She writes that she was re-traumatized \\"for weeks\\" as memories of her past sexual trauma were triggered by a business promising female empowerment but \\"people probably just want your money.\\" The book Sensation by Isabel Losada ends with a \\"Warning\\" about \\"'hard sell' techniques... 'One Taste' (like many businesses) offer a wide range of courses which are outside the price range of most bank accounts. I'll say it again. Please don't spend money that you don't have.\\" In June 2018, Bloomberg Businessweek published an article chronicling recent training changes and that was critical of how the company treated its employees and consultants, often pressuring them to take expensive courses, programs, and retreats that drove them into debt. Former members of the organization testifying about their experience at OneTaste said it \\"resembled a kind of prostitution ring\\", where managers frequently ordered staffers to engage in sexual relations with customers. In 2015, a former employee received a 6-figure settlement for sexual assault and harassment. Around universities, students are drawn to free OneTaste events with ad boards such as \\"Tired of Swiping Left? Let‚Äôs Talk Real Intimacy!\\" or \\"You Do Yoga. You Meditate. Now try #OrgasmicMeditation\\". A year-long, $60,000 premium membership is sold by the company since 2014. OneTaste teaches their members that money is just an emotional obstacle, which led some of them down to thousands of dollars in credit card debts.

The former Roman Catholic Diocese of Ypres, in present-day Belgium, existed from 1559 to 1801.Ypres (Ieper) (Diocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy] Its seat was Saint Martin's Cathedral in Ypres. In 1969 it was reconstituted as a titular see. History The diocese was originally part of the Diocese of Th√©rouanne, which had been established in the 7th or 8th century. In 1553 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor besieged the city of Th√©rouanne, then a French enclave in the Holy Roman Empire, in revenge for a defeat by the French at Metz. After he captured Th√©rouanne, he razed the city. In 1557, as a result of the war damage to its see, the diocese was abolished. This led to a reform of sees at the Council of Trent and the bishopric of Th√©rouanne was split between the Diocese of Saint-Omer, the Diocese of Boulogne and the Diocese of Ypres. With this, Saint Martin's Church was elevated to cathedral status, as it became the see of the new diocese. After the Concordat of 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII, Ypres was incorporated into the Diocese of Ghent, and Saint Martin's lost its status as a cathedral. Cornelius Jansen, the father of the theological movement Jansenism, was Bishop of Ypres from 1635 to 1638.

The members are characters from movies, books, cartoons, television, video games, and comics. To qualify for the list, members must be \\"both fictional (in the sense that we excluded mythological and folkloric figures) and characters (meaning they are part of a narrative story or series of stories),\\" in addition to being wealthy. The one exception to the rule was Santa Claus, a character whom Forbes decided to be an \\"irresistible\\" addition, although he has been absent from the list since 2006. Forbes stated, \\"We still estimate Claus's net worth as infinite, but we excluded him from this year's rankings after being bombarded by letters from outraged children insisting that Claus is real. We don't claim to have settled the ongoing controversy concerning Claus's existence, but after taking into account the physical evidence‚Äîtoys delivered, milk and cookies devoured‚Äîwe felt it was safer to remove him from consideration.\\" After Claus was excluded, Scrooge McDuck became the wealthiest member due to being portrayed as having a tower vault full of gold.. Carol Miller or \\"Mom\\" from Futurama is the wealthiest woman on the list, with an estimated $15.7 Billion. The wealth of fictional characters under consideration for the list is calculated by combining the fictional source texts with real-world information about stock and commodity prices.

It is a low latency, low cost alternative to exchange traded equities and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are listed on primary exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Euronext and OMX. Previously a multilateral trading facility (MTF), BATS Chi-X Europe received Recognised Investment Exchange (RIE) status from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in May 2013, and was from then authorised to operate a Regulated Market for primary listings alongside its existing business. Initially two separate entities, Chi-X Europe was the first pan-European equities exchange to launch in 2007; BATS Europe was launched in 2008. In February 2011, BATS Global Markets agreed to buy Chi-X Europe for $300 million. The deal was referred by the Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission in June 2011 for further investigation to \\"determine whether a substantial lessening of competition is probable as a result of the anticipated merger.\\" However, the Competition Commission approved the transaction in late November 2011, leading to BATS closing the deal on 30 November 2011. History Chi-X Europe Chi-X Europe was established in 2007 by Instinet. Ownership in Chi-X Europe was eventually broadened to include a consortium of major global financial institutions including BNP Paribas, Citadel, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Fortis, GETCO Europe Ltd, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Optiver, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale and UBS. However, on 1 December 2011, BATS Global Markets acquired the firm from the consortium. When it launched, Chi-X Europe was the first multilateral trading facility that launched in anticipation of the European Union's November 2007 Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which paved the way for the introduction of alternative trading venues in Europe. In February 2009, Peter Randall, who took over CEO duties from Chairman Tony Mackay shortly after launch, quit Chi-X Europe unexpectedly and was replaced by Alasdair Haynes in December 2009. Randall reportedly left for \\"personal reasons\\". Citadel LLC named Randall as chief executive of Equiduct Systems on 18 December 2009. Also in February 2009, The Wall Street Journal reported that \\"Chi-X performed 9.1% of trades in the 10 largest European markets, including 15% of trades in FTSE 100 stocks\\" and also that \\"In London, Europe's main equity center, Chi-X Europe is now trading nearly 15% of U.K. equities, a performance that has contributed to the London Stock Exchange's market share falling below 75% for the first time.\\" In February 2010, Chi-X Europe's chief operating officer Hirander Misra suddenly quit the firm to \\"pursue other interests\\". Misra had helped guide the company along with Randall, from its start until it became the second-largest market by share. Despite the management turnover, Chi-X Europe continued to grow, steadily increasing its market share and regularly introducing new products, such as the Chi-Delta dark book it introduced in April 2009. By mid-2010, the company had been profitable for several quarters and had reached a pan- European equities market share of nearly 20%, leading to an acquisition offer. BATS Europe BATS Trading Limited (BATS Europe) was established in 2008 by U.S. exchange operator BATS Global Markets. In April 2008, BATS named Mark Hemsley as chief executive officer and Paul O‚ÄôDonnell as chief operating officer. BATS Europe was launched later that year on 31 October 2008. By 2010, BATS Europe was the second-largest MTF, behind Chi-X Europe, leading to it acquiring the other company. Combined firm In April 2011, BATS Global Markets confirmed that Mark Hemsley, CEO of BATS Europe, will be appointed CEO of the combined entity following BATS‚Äô acquisition of Chi-X Europe. The joint entity, BATS Chi-X Europe, covered 1,800 stocks, in 25 indices and 15 European countries, as of early 2012. Between January and April 2012, BATS Chi-X Europe was the largest pan-European equities exchange in terms of value traded. In December 2011, BATS Chi-X Europe had a pan-European marketshare of more than 25% and 24.6% in April 2012. By April 2012 the technology integration between the two platforms was complete and Chi-X Europe customers were migrated onto the BATS Europe platform. In March 2013, after Europe's two largest cash equities clearing providers unveiled plans to merge, BATS Chi-X Europe announced it would take a 25% stake in the new entity, which will be called EuroCCP N.V.EMCF and EuroCCP (17 July 2013), Sale And Purchase Agreement Signed To Combine Emcf and Euroccp, retrieved 30 August 2013 During June 2016, it announced it was to offer a free UK index series with real-time information to private and retail investors which included FTSE 100 rival, the Bats UK 100. Regulatory environment Chi-X Europe is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to operate a multilateral trading facility (MTF), as defined under MiFID, for the trading of pan-European securities. Chi-X Europe meets the same level of regulatory standards as traditional exchanges and receives the same level of supervision as explained by the FCA: \\"we aim to ensure that Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) with a similar market impact or market share as Regulated Markets (i.e. exchanges) receive the same level of supervision as those markets, even though MTFs sit under a slightly different legal regulatory regime.\\" See also * London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange * Euronext * NYSE Euronext References  External links  BATS Global Markets Stock exchanges in the United Kingdom Financial services companies based in London ","title":"BATS Chi-X Europe"},{"id":"14393367","text":"The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) is the regulator of the capital market of Bangladesh, comprising Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE).

The former requires the player the mastery of upper register, as it is difficult to control especially with the distance.

Guadalc√°zar is a Mexican municipality, within the state of San Luis Potos√≠, Northeastern Mexico. Geography Guadalc√°zar municipality is north of the municipality of Cerritos. Most of the residents live in two towns within the municipality, El Quelital and Buenavista. It is among the biggest municipalities of Mexico (municipios) located in the state of San Luis Potos√≠. History The town was one of the many colonial establishments founded by Spanish explorer and Viceroy of New Spain, Juan Cordoba de Guadalcazar, Marquis of Guadalc√°zar, in 1620. In the decades following its founding, Guadalcazar flourished as a wealthy town. Its main exports were coal, iron, silver, and other industrial materials. This was because of the many hills surrounding the town were rich in mineral deposits. After the minerals were exhausted by 300 years of mining the hills, in the early twentieth century, the population slowly diminished. Mexican Revolution After the Mexican Revolution, the privately owned mines were taken over by the new government.(This information is from the genealogical history done by Mary Lou POSADAS Iverson as documented by Jose Posadas Posadas of Guadalc√°zar.) Modern economy and culture Guadalcazar changed little for nearly half a century in the latter 1900s, until the Mexican government recently recognized the churches that were built during the Spanish Colonial period as being of great architectural and historical importance. Since then, media attention has been increasing for Guadalcazar, making it a tourism destination. The re- population of Guadalcazar has also increased due to many American miners looking for precious minerals. Minerals have been located deep within hillsides, and the mining process is beginning once again. Despite this change in attention, Guadalcazar's population has hovered steadily between 500 and 900 residents, the majority being elderly. Events The main times of tourism are during the summer months beginning in June, and during the winter around Christmas. ;Winter In the winter, visitors come for the religious ceremonies that take place throughout the town. On Christmas Eve, virtually the entire community gathers at the town square to march throughout the town and outskirts saying Roman Catholic prayers. On Christmas Day, a large festival is held celebrating the birth of Jesus. The majority of visitors are from the United States, as the younger generations of original local Mexican families have moved for various reasons. This leaves 'U.S. American' impressions on the local population, resulting in a unique blend of cultures. ;Summer During the summer, there are festivals held in honor of the town and to celebrate the season. This event is commonly known as \\"La fiesta del Rancho\\" or the Ranch Festival. Government The small government is functional yet corrupt, so the community relies on its population to form non- narcotic trafficant's for seats of power.

The original settlers used the waters of Last Mountain Lake, which is 93 kilometres long, as a means of transportation. Supplies for the farmers were brought north up the lake and all the grain was taken down the lake in boats, then stored in elevators at the East End. This lake transportation system was abandoned when the early extension of the Canadian Pacific Railway Kirkella branch from Bulyea to Lanigan and on to Saskatoon was built, opening up more of the country to the settlers.

In 1291, she was betrothed to the Ilkhanate khan Arghun by the Mongol Great Khan Kublai, but married his son Ghazan when Arghun died by the time she had arrived in Persia in 1293. The account of the travel of the princess to Persia was given by Marco Polo.  Name  Note that, among the various English translations of Polo's book, there are at least ten spellings for this woman's name. Absent various accented characters here, the names include Cocachin, Cocacin, Cozotine, Kogatin, Kokachin, Kokechin, Kokejin, Kokochin, Kukachin, and Kukajin. Background Following the loss of Arghun's favourite wife Bolgana (\\"Zibeline\\"), Arghun sent a request to his grand-uncle Kublai Khan to send him a relative of his dead wife, saying that only one of her kinswomen should succeed her. Kublai chose the 17-year-old K√∂k√∂chin. \\"K√∂k√∂\\" may mean \\"blue\\" (especially \\"sky blue\\") or \\"dark\\" as in complexion, and \\"chin\\" or \\"jin\\" a suffix used for the name of a person, and the name \\"K√∂k√∂chin\\" may therefore be translated as \\"The Dark Complected\\". Kublai, from his capital of Khanbaliq (the Khan's city, modern day Beijing) entrusted Marco Polo with his last duty, to escort princess K√∂kechin to Arghun along with three envoys, Oulatai, Apusca and Coja. The party travelled by sea, departing from the southern port city of Quanzhou in the spring of 1291. There were 14 big ships in all, and each had 4 masts and 12 sails. They set out from Quanzhou, sailing to Sumatra where they were delayed for five months due to weather, and then to Persia, via Sri Lanka and India (where his visits included Mylapore, Madurai and Alleppey, which he nicknamed Venice of the East). They arrived around 1293. Arghun had died in the meantime however, and K√∂k√∂chin married Arghun's son Ghazan and became his principal wife. She died in June 1296.

She was also one of the incorporators of the organization in 1913. The sorority has continued to generate social capital for nearly 111 years. Boyd was an educator in Washington, D.C. public schools for more than thirty years, and expanded her students' worlds by taking them to Congressional hearings. She was one of the most politically active of the founders of Alpha Kappa Alpha, with interests both domestic and international. In 1938 Boyd established the Non-Partisan Council, the first group representing minorities to lobby the United States Congress. For her efforts in creating and guiding the Non-Partisan Council, in 1948 Boyd was named \\"Woman of the Year in the Field of Legislation\\" by the National Council of Negro Women. Boyd was active in a wide variety of organizations, including many with an international focus. Named a United Nations observer, Boyd represented the United States on several committees, as well as at a conference in Brazil. Early life Boyd was educated in public schools in Washington, D.C. In September 1906, Boyd was admitted to Howard University's College of Arts and Sciences, where she majored in math.Parker 1999, op. cit., p. 15. Howard University was the top historically black college in the nation. It was a time when only 1/3 of 1% of African Americans and 5% of whites of eligible age attended any college.James D. Anderson, The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860‚Äì1935. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1988, p.245 Boyd graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1910.Parker 1999, op. cit., p. 16. Career and later life A lifelong learner, over the years Boyd took graduate courses in education and public relations at Columbia University, New York University, University of California at Berkeley, Vermont's Middlebury College Language School, National Autonomous University of Mexico, American University and George Washington University. For more than thirty years, Boyd was an educator in public schools in Washington, D.C. Boyd would bring student council officers to congressional hearings, to educate them about the political process. She retired from teaching in 1948. Alpha Kappa Alpha Incorporation of the sorority At Howard University, Norma Elizabeth Boyd was one of seven sophomore initiates of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority in February 1908. She served as Alpha chapter's president at two different times. After some sisters left to start a sorority with a different focus, Boyd, Nellie Quander, Julia Evangeline Brooks, Minnie B. Smith, Nellie Pratt Russell, and Ethel Jones Mowbray incorporated Alpha Kappa Alpha on January 29, 1913. The dissenters formed another sorority called Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. Involvement in the sorority In 1913, Boyd was the corresponding secretary on the first Directorate of Alpha Kappa Alpha. She also was a regional director of the North Atlantic Region. Boyd chartered the Xi Omega chapter in Washington, D.C., where she served as president. In 1934, she raised funds for the first year of Alpha Kappa Alpha's Mississippi Health Project. During World War II, Boyd chaired two symposia at Howard University: \\"Labor and Women in the War Effort,\\" a three-day event, and \\"Defense Planning for the Future,\\" a five-day conference. Non-Partisan Council In 1938, Boyd established the \\"Non-Partisan Lobby for Economic and Democratic Rights\\" (NPC), which lobbied Congress on issues of public service, education, voting rights, and employment related to African-Americans. Later, the organization worked on civil, social, and political issues. The NPC reviewed all congressional bills, providing comments to Congress when necessary. In addition, the Non-Partisan Council helped to expand the Public Works Program and establish a minimum wage for laundry workers, and supported continuation of the American Youth Act. During World War II, the council lobbied for civil rights legislation. The Non-Partisan Council also lobbied agencies such as the Department of State, the United Nations, and national educational, scientific, and cultural organizations, to draw attention to the need for integration. Lasting ten years, the organization was dissolved on July 15, 1948, by Supreme Basileus Edna Over Gray-Campbell.McNealey 2006, op. cit., p. 157. The Non- Partisan Council worked with the NAACP, The Urban League, The United Office and Professional Workers of America, The National Association of Graduate Nurses, the American Federation of Churches, the Colored Women's Club, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Auxiliary, and the New York Voter's League.Parker 1999, op. cit., p. 195. Established in 1946, the American Council of Human Rights superseded the Non-Partisan Council.McNealey 2006, op. cit., p. 159. For her efforts in creating and guiding the Non-Partisan Council, in 1948 Boyd was named \\"Woman of the Year in the Field of Legislation\\" by the National Council of Negro Women. United Nations Involvement Norma Boyd c. 1982 Norma Boyd was named as a United Nations observer in 1949. She took part in several committees, such as the Advisory Committee to the American Delegate to the Inter-American Council of Women, the Pan-American Liaison Committee, and the East-West Association. In 1949 Boyd traveled to South America as an observer at the Inter-American Commission of Women in Buenos Aires, Argentina. At the conference, she was a delegate representing the United Nation's Non-Government Organizations, the International House Association, the People's Mandate Committee, and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. While in Brazil, Boyd also founded a chapter of International House. As an observer, Boyd was interested in children's rights and supported Principle 10 of the Declaration of Human Rights. To help educate her students, one year Boyd financed twenty-five of them for a trip to the United Nations' General Assembly in New York City. Later life In 1959, Boyd established the Women's International Religious Fellowship. The organization, which consisted of women from diverse backgrounds and cultures, helped to draw attention to children's safety and rights. Boyd traveled widely in her life, to cities in United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, and the British West Indies. She wrote an autobiography, A Love that Equals My Labor. Norma Elizabeth Boyd, the last surviving founder of Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA), died in Washington, D.C. on March 14, 1985. Membership in other organizations Boyd was active in a wide variety of organizations: #Professional: National Council of Mathematics Teachers, American Federation of Teachers, and American Teacher's Association; #International: International Committee of the Temple of Understanding, Women's International Religious Fellowship, Pan-American Liaison Committee, and Women's International League for Peace and Freedom; and #Political: Non- Partisan Council, East-West Association, and People's Mandate Committee. Boyd was also president of the International House Association in Washington, D.C. From 1958‚Äì1959 she chaired the World Fellowship Inter-Faith Committee at All Saints Unitarian Church of Washington, D.C.

R Family Vacations is a LGBT vacation entertainment company that provides luxury cruise ship trips with a focus on inclusive activities for children and services including same-sex marriage ceremonies. History In 2003, Rosie O'Donnell and her then partner Kelli Carpenter-O'Donnell partnered with travel entrepreneur Gregg Kaminsky to launch R Family Vacations catering to both gays and lesbians, \\"the very first all gay and lesbian family vacation packages\\" where \\"gays and lesbians can bring their kids, their friends, and their parents.\\" O'Donnell is not involved on a day-to-day basis, but provides marketing and promotional advice. She came up with the idea for the company when she filled in as a last-minute replacement headliner on a gay cruise being promoted by Kaminsky. Kaminsky's partner is a business partner of O'Donnell's. Maiden voyage (2004) The Norwegian Dawn docked in Saint Thomas, US Virgin Islands. On July 11, 2004, the first cruise was held aboard Norwegian Cruise Lines's Norwegian Dawn with 1600 passengers including 600 children. By the third year, the cruise was selling out to a maximum capacity of 2,600 passengers. In addition to traditional entertainment and recreational activities, the company partnered with Provincetown‚Äôs Family Pride, a 25-year- old Washington, D.C.-based organization that advocates for GLBT families, to host discussions on \\"adoption, insemination, surrogacy, and everything else that would be helpful to gay parenting. Metropolitan Community Church, the predominantly GLBT Christian denomination, had clergy on board to perform wedding ceremonies and conduct interfaith services and there was also discussion groups for kids and a panel discussion where teens could share their experiences of growing up with gay and lesbian parents. 2007 In 2007, the company considered making Bermuda one of its stops. Recalling a 2004 incident between Norwegian Cruise Lines' all gay cruises and Christian \\"protesters chanting anti-gay slogans\\" in Nassau, Bahamas,(via wayback machine as has expired) Kaminsky claimed that Bermuda, which he incorrectly believed had tourism as its main industry, would face economic repercussions if a similar event occurred in the British overseas territory, which has long held a reputation for being anti-gay and only the year before the local legislature refused to even consider outlawing sexuality-based discrimination. While the trip was supported by Premier and Minister of Tourism and Transportation Dr. Ewart Brown, it was opposed by one of his close political allies, Andre Curtis, the organiser of a controversial \\"Faith-Based Tourism\\" initiative, who organised some eighty churches into an interfaith group called \\"United by Faith\\" to oppose the planned visit alongside local African Methodist Episcopal churches. R Families decided to change the itinerary to replace Bermuda with two stops in Florida and a private island. Kaminsky stated Ironically, Bermuda has actually been the host of gay tourism for many years. The LGBT travel company Pied Piper, for example, has been organising trips ‚Äî albeit on a smaller scale ‚Äî to the country since 1990, without incident. 2008 Ross Mathews singing karaoke on R Family Vacations cruise with Rosie O'Donnell, in July 2007.

It is located near Redberry Lake, which consists of only salt water. History The first overseer was T.G. Bavin for the village of Hafford in 1914. The Hafford Village Council and Board of Trade requested a doctor, and Dr. Whitemarsh was appointed for the village. The early community was first served by Luxembourg Post Office. The early village had three lumber yards, a general store, I.H.C. agency, a poolroom, livery barn, hardware, and post office. In 1913 the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the first restaurant opened. The hotel and bar were established in 1914. Power came to Hafford in 1916, and the Hafford Rural Telephone Company was established in 1916. The Hafford hospital was built in 1922. Hafford was served by the Ukrainian Catholic Church established 1911, the Ukrainian Orthodox church built 1909, the Roman Catholic Church erected about the same time. The Anglican church was built in 1918, and the Methodist church which was erected in Hafford moved to Richard. The Dominion Government Illustration Station was operated between 1932-1955. This station tested grains, and fertilizers and improved livestock. Demographics Education The Hafford community was served firstly by the Whiteberry School District which constructed their school building over two years 1906-1908, opening in 1909 followed by the Rus School District opening 1910. In this area, the Alberton School District, Gooseberry School District, Slawa School District and the Craigmore School District were all organised in 1912. The Hafford School District and Nauka School Districts were organised in 1914, Langley School District 1916, and both the Lost Lake School District, and the Canada School District in 1918. Transportation Historically, the railroad connecting Prince Albert and North Battleford was laid in 1913, and upon the rail line, a site was chosen for the village of Hafford site. The community is served by Hafford Airport which is located 1 nautical mile (1.9 km) northwest and the Carlton Trail Railway that runs parallel to Highway 40.

Visually, each i-card has a card-shaped picture and a card name associated with it that enable people to organize their digital identities and to easily select one they want to use for any given interaction. The information card metaphor is implemented by identity selectors like Windows CardSpace, DigitalMe or Higgins Identity Selector. An identity metasystem is an interoperable architecture for digital identity that enables people to have and employ a collection of digital identities based on multiple underlying technologies, implementations, and providers. Using this approach, customers can continue to use their existing identity infrastructure investments, choose the identity technology that works best for them, and more easily migrate from old technologies to new technologies without sacrificing interoperability with others. The identity metasystem is based upon the principles in \\"The Laws of Identity\\". Overview Information cards shown in DigitalMe Identity Selector There are three participants in digital identity interactions using information cards: * Identity providers issue digital identities for you. For example, businesses might issue identities to their customers, governments might vouch for the identities of their citizens, credit card issuers might provide identities enabling payment, online services could provide verified data such as age, and individuals might use self-issued identities to log onto websites. * Relying parties (RPs) accept identities for you. Online services that you use can accept digital identities that you choose and use the information provided by them on your behalf, with your consent. * Subject is yourself, the party in control of all these interactions. The subject can choose which of its applicable digital identities to use with the relying party. Selectors Microsoft's Windows CardSpace implementation of an identity selector An identity selector is used to store, manage, and use their digital identities. Examples of identity selectors are Microsoft's Windows CardSpace, the Bandit Project's DigitalMe, and several kinds of Identity Selectors from the Eclipse Foundation's Higgins project. An identity selector performs the following user-centric identity management tasks: * Provides a consistent user experience for authentication (and in some cases other kinds of interactions) with an RP (also known as a Service Provider). * Provides a user interface that displays a set of information card icons from which the user selects their preferred i-card when authentication is required by a local application or relying party (e.g. a website's login page). * Provides a user interface to create and manage personal (also known as self-issued) information cards. * Provides a local security token service that is used to issue the security tokens for personal i-cards. * Provides a user interface to import and export information cards in standard file formats. * Is invoked by a browser extension or by a local rich client application. An identity selector may also allow the user to manage (e.g. create, review, update, and delete cards within) their portfolio of i-cards. Identity metasystems There are five key components to an identity metasystem: * A way to represent identities using claims. Claims are carried in security tokens, as per WS-Security. * A means for identity providers, relying parties, and subjects to negotiate. Dynamically negotiating the claims to be delivered and the security token format used enables the identity metasystem to carry any format of token and any kinds of claims needed for a digital identity interaction. Negotiation occurs using WS- SecurityPolicy statements exchanged using WS-MetadataExchange. * An encapsulating protocol to obtain claims and requirements. The WS-Trust and WS- Federation protocols are used to carry requests for security tokens and responses containing those tokens. * A means to bridge technology and organizational boundaries using claims transformation. Security token services (STS) as defined in WS-Trust are used to transform claim contents and formats. * A consistent user experience across multiple contexts, technologies, and operators. This is achieved via identity selector client software such as Windows CardSpace representing digital identities owned by users as visual i-cards. Generic qualities * I-cards are created by an entity known as a issuer. * I-cards display the name of the issuer (issuerName) in a text string. * I-cards have a text string to identify the card (cardName) that is initially set by the card issuer. Typically this card name is user-editable. * I-cards may have a (GIF or JPEG) background image (cardImage) set by the card issuer (user-editable). * In most i-cards the user is able to see the value of the claims. Sign-in capabilities The graphic used to indicate information card support Using i-cards, users can authenticate without needing a username and password for every website; instead, at sites accepting them, they can log in with an i-card, which may be used at multiple sites. Each information card utilizes a distinct pair-wise digital key for every realm where a key is requested. A realm may be a single site or a set of related sites all sharing the same target scope information when requesting an information card. The use of distinct pair-wise keys per realm means that even if a person is tricked into logging into an imposter site with an i-card, a different key would be used at that site than the site that the imposter was trying to impersonate; no shared secret is released. Furthermore, many identity selectors provide a means of phishing detection, where the HTTPS certificate of the relying party site is checked and compared against a list of the sites at which the user has previously used an information card. When a new site is visited, the user is informed that they have not previously used a card there. Types of i-cards The Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/1/a/11ac6505-e4c0-4e05-987c-6f1d31855cd2/Identity_Selector_Interoperability_Profile_V1.5.pdf (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft)http://www.oasis- open.org/committees/download.php/29979/identity-1.0-spec-cd-01.pdf specifies two types of information cards that an identity selector must support. * Personal Information Cards: (Also called self-issued) these cards allow you to issue claims about yourself to sites willing to accept them. These claims can include your name, address, phone numbers, e-mail address, web address, birth date, gender, and a site-specific key uniquely generated for each site where the card is used. * Managed Information Cards: These cards allow identity providers other than yourself to make claims about you to sites willing to accept them. These claims can include any information that an RP requests, an identity provider is able to provide, and you are willing to send between them. The Higgins project is defining two new kinds of i-cards as well: * Relationship cards (or R-cards) are used to establish an ongoing relationship between multiple parties. * Zero-knowledge cards (or Z-cards) However the Information Card format allows for custom types; The Bandit project demonstrated prototype managed cards backed by OpenIDs at the Novell BrainShare conference in March 2007. Personal cards The first kind of personal Information cards were also introduced as part of Microsoft‚Äôs Windows CardSpace software in November 2006. Their behavior is also defined by the same documents covering the Microsoft-defined managed cards (see above). Summary of characteristics: * Data format an XML file containing: set of claim type URIs as well as the (user-defined) values of these claims, cardImage, a unique cardID, etc. This data format is defined in the ISIP documents. * Issuer: The user's own Identity Selector. Personal cards can be described as self-issued * Genesis: Created by the user's Identity Selector. * Claims: 15 pre-defined claim types (e.g. firstname, surname, email address, etc.) are defined in the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft). * Authority: The user's Identity Selector is the authority for the issued token's set of claim values. * Data flow: On demand (e.g. as needed by a relying site), an STS local to the Identity Selector creates a security token with the current values. * Editability: The claim values are directly editable by the user. * Attribute data source: The personal card XML file contains claim values. When imported into an Identity Selector these data values are then managed internally by the selector. Managed information cards The first kind of managed card was introduced as part of Microsoft‚Äôs Windows CardSpace software in November 2006. The behavior, file format and interoperability characteristics of these kinds of managed cards are defined by Microsoft documents such as the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft; see self- issued.info for a more complete list), in combination with open standards including WS-Trusthttp://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/02/trust/WS-Trust.pdf and others. Summary of characteristics: * Data format: an XML file containing: network endpoint of the STS, set of claim type URIs, name of the card, cardImage, issuerName, a unique cardID, etc. The XML file format is defined in the ISIP documents. * Issuer: An external, third party token service (representing an external person or organization). * Genesis: A managed card is generated by a Security Token Service running at an Identity Provider site and imported into the user's Identity Selector. * Claims: The list of supported claim types (claim type URIs) is defined by the issuer. * Authority: The issuer is the sole authority for the claim values contained within the token it issues. * Data flow: Managed cards contain a network endpoint reference to an STS that, when requested by the Identity Selector (using WS- Trust, etc.) generates/provides a security token containing the required claims. * Editability: Underlying attribute data is not directly editable by the user. * Attribute data source: Determined by the issuer, and generally managed by the issuer. I-cards issued by third parties can employ any of four methods for the user to authenticate himself as the card owner: * a Personal Information Card (self-issued), * an X.509 certificate (which can either be from a hardware device such as a SmartCard or it can be a software certificate), * a Kerberos ticket, such as those issued by many enterprise login solutions, or * a username and password for the card. Additional methods could also be implemented by future identity selectors and identity providers. Managed i-cards can be auditing, non-auditing, or auditing-optional: * Auditing cards require the identity of the RP site to be disclosed to the Identity Provider. This can be used to restrict which sites the identity provider is willing to release information to. * Non-auditing cards will not disclose the identity of the RP site to the Identity Provider. * Auditing- optional cards will disclose the identity of the Relying Party site if provided by the RP, but do not require this disclosure. Relationship cards Relationship cards are under development by the Higgins project (see the report by Paul Trevithick). Summary of characteristics: * Data format: A managed card that supports a resource-udi claim. * Supported Claims: Like all managed (or personal) cards, r-cards include a list of supported claim types (expressed as URIs) as defined by the issuer. This set defines the maximal set of claims that issuer will include in its generated security token. These claims are inherited from underlying ISIP-m-card upon which it is based and are used for the same purposes. Beyond managed cards the resource-udi \\"meta\\" claim provides a reference to a set of attributes. * Authority: The issuer is the authority for the issued token's set of claim values (as per a normal managed or personal card). * Editability: The values of underlying attributes (referenced by the resource-udi claim) may be editable by parties other than the issuer. * Supported Attributes: The value of an r-card's resource-udi claim is an Entity UDIhttp://parity.com/udi (URI) that \\"points to\\" a data entity (representing a person, organization, or other object). The set of attributes of this data entity is distinct from (though usually a superset of) the \\"supported claims\\" mentioned above. =Reliance on the Higgins Data Model= Conceptually a managed card is essentially a human-friendly \\"pointer\\" to a Token Service‚Äîa web service (e.g. a STS) from which security tokens can be requested. A security token is a set of attribute assertions (aka claims) about some party that is cryptographically signed by the issuer (the token service acting as the authority). An r-card, contains a second \\"pointer\\" that points to a data entity whose attribute's values (i) shared by all parties to the r-card and (ii) form the underlying attributes that are consumed by the r-card issuer's STS and provide the values of the claims that this STS makes. By including this second \\"pointer\\" on the r-card, r-card holders have the potential to access and update some subset of these underlying attributes. The card issuer maintains an access control policy to control who has what level of access. This second pointer is an Entity UDI‚Äîa reference to an Entity object in the Higgins Context Data Model. Entity UDIs may be dereferenced and the underlying Entity's attributes accessed by using the Higgins project's Identity Attribute Service. Once resolved, consumers of this service can inspect, and potentially modify the attributes of the entity as well as get its schema as described in Web Ontology Language (OWL). In addition to basic identity attribute values like strings and numbers, the data entity referred to by an r-card can have complex attribute values consisting of aggregates of basic attribute types as well as UDI links to other entities. Claims Beyond being used to log into sites, Information Cards can also facilitate other kinds of interactions. The Information Card model provides great flexibility because cards can be used to convey any information from an Identity Provider to a Relying Party that makes sense to both of them and that the person is willing to release. The data elements carried in i-cards are called Claims. One possible use of claims is online age verification, with Identity Providers providing proof-of-age cards, and RPs accepting them for purposes such as online wine sales; other attributes could be verified as well. Another is online payment, where merchants could accept online payment cards from payment issuers, containing only the minimal information needed to facilitate payment. Role statements carried by claims can be used for access control decisions by Relying Parties. Interoperability and licensing The protocols needed to build Identity Metasystem components can be used by anyone for any purpose with no licensing cost and interoperable implementations can be built using only publicly available documentation. Patent promises have been issued by Microsoft, IBM, and others ensuring that the protocols underlying the Identity Metasystem can be freely used by all. The Information Cards defined by the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft) are based on open, interoperable communication standards. Interoperable i-card components have been built by dozens of companies and projects for platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, plus a prototype implementation for phones. Together, these components implement an interoperable Identity Metasystem. Information Cards can be used to provide identities both for Web sites and Web Services applications. Several interoperability testing events for i-cards have been sponsored by OSIS and the Burton Group, one was at the Interop at the October 2007 European Catalyst Conference in Barcelonahttp://identityblog.burtongroup.com/bgidps/2007/10/osis-user- centr.html and the most recent was at RSA 2008. These events are helping to ensure that the different Information Card software components being built by the numerous participants in the Identity Metasystem work well together. The protocols needed to build Information Card implementations based on the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft) can be used by anyone for any purpose at no cost and interoperable implementations can be built using only publicly available documentation. Patent promises have been issued by Microsoft, IBM, and others, ensuring that this Information Card technology is freely available to all. In June 2008, industry leaders including Equifax, Google, Microsoft, Novell, Oracle, PayPal and others created the Information Card Foundation in order to advance the use of the Information Card metaphor as a key component of an open, interoperable, royalty-free, user-centric identity layer spanning both the enterprise and the Internet. In his report on the Interop at the June 2007 Catalyst Conference in San Francisco,http://identityblog.burtongroup.com/bgidps/2007/08/recapping- the-c.html analyst Bob Blakley wrote: > The interop event was a milestone in the maturation of user-centric identity > technology. Prior to the event, there were some specifications, one > commercial product, and a number of open-source projects.

History of the terminology The term \\"information card\\" was introduced by Microsoft in May 2005 as a name for the visual information card metaphor to be introduced in its forthcoming Windows CardSpace software. Until early 2006, information cards were also sometimes referred to by the code-name ‚ÄúInfoCard‚Äù, which was not a name that was freely available for all to use. The name information card was specifically chosen as one that would be freely available for all to use, independent of any product or implementation. The name ‚Äúinformation card‚Äù is not trademarked and is so generic as to not be trademarkable. The term i-card was introduced at the June 21, 2006, Berkman/MIT Identity Mashup conference. The intent was to define a term that was not associated with any industry TM or other IP or artifact. At the time, Microsoft had not yet finished applying the Open Specification Promise to the protocols underlying Windows CardSpace and there was also a misunderstanding that the term information card was not freely available for use by all, so to be conservative, the term i-card was introduced. Mike Jones, of Microsoft, explained to participants of a session at IIW 2007b that Microsoft always intended the term information card to be used generically to describe all kinds of information cards and to be freely usable by all, and tried to correct the earlier misunderstanding that the term might apply only to the kinds of information cards originally defined by Microsoft. He made the case that the industry would be better served by having everyone use the common term information card, than having two terms in use with the same meaning, since there remains no legal or technical reason for different terms. In this case the term i-card would become just the short form of information card, just like e-mail has become the short form of electronic mail.

He was the 5th Secretary General of the Commonwealth of Nations from 2008 to 2016, having previously served as the High Commissioner for India in London. Early life and background Kamalesh Sharma is an alumnus of the Modern School, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi, St. Stephen's College in Delhi and King's College, Cambridge. Career Sharma was an officer in the Indian Foreign Service from 1965 to 2001. He served as India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, from Aug 1997 to May 2002, before his retirement from IFS. From 2002 to 2004, he served as UN Secretary General's special representative to East Timor. He was appointed as the High Commissioner of India to Britain in 2004. He is a Vice-President of the Royal Commonwealth Society. He has also been the Chancellor of Queen's University Belfast since July 2009. Commonwealth Secretary-General Sharma was elected to the position of secretary-general over Michael Frendo, foreign minister of Malta, during the biennial Commonwealth summit in Kampala, Uganda held from 22 to 24 November 2007. He took over from Sir Don McKinnon of New Zealand on 1 April 2008. Sharma was re- elected on 30 October 2011 at the 2011 CHOGM. He was unopposed, having been proposed by India and seconded by Pakistan. His second and final four-year term began on 1 April 2012 and ended 30 March 2016. Sharma has been criticised as a \\"decent but ineffective\\" Secretary-General by Hugh Segal, Canada's former special envoy to the Commonwealth, who commented that under Sharma's tenure, the organization has been \\"missing in action on Sri Lankan human rights, vicious anti-gay laws in some parts of Africa and continued weakness in the promotion of judicial independence and democracy.\\" Geoffrey Robertson QC described Sharma's tenure in the following terms: \\"...for eight years before 2016 it was led by an Indian diplomat who would not have known a human right if he fell over it. Sharma responded to such criticism stating: ‚ÄúThe most important point about the Commonwealth is that it engages with member states to advance the values template. I made five visits to Sri Lanka, but you can‚Äôt keep on talking about it in public for the reason that work has to be done below the radar to carry political conviction.\\" During his eight-year tenure as Commonwealth Secretary-General, Sharma focused on the empowerment of young people, the advancement of women's political and economic rights and raising international awareness of challenges facing small states as pressing priorities. Sharma was described by Arif Zaman, Executive Director of the Commonwealth Businesswomen's Network as \\"someone who has been a passionate, active and dedicated champion for women, combining advocacy with practical steps\\". On Sharma's tenure, The Rt Hon Hugo Swire, UK Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office commented that Sharma \\"helped to guide the Commonwealth through a period of significant challenges and he can be rightly proud of the important developments that have taken place under his leadership, such as the introduction of the Commonwealth Charter\\". At the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta, 27 November 2015, Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of Malta stated that Sharma had \\"done a very good job at providing leadership and introducing new initiatives during his tenure.\\" He gave thanks to Sharma \\"for his unflinching commitment to the Commonwealth\\", adding that \\"his legacy will undoubtedly be a positive one\\".  Chancellor of Queen's University, Belfast  On 9 July 2009, Sharma was appointed Chancellor of Queen's University Belfast after the retirement of Senator George J. Mitchell. Queen's says, he was responsible for cementing relations between Northern Ireland and India, which led to the country's investment in Northern Ireland businesses. The position is a largely honorary title and Sharma said he was enormously proud to be given the job at Queen's.

It can be used on materials for which a press setup would be prohibitively large or require an unreasonably high pressure, and is generally much cheaper than building a large enough and sufficiently high-pressure press; on the other hand, it is unavoidably an individual job production process, producing one product at a time and with a long setup time. There are various approaches; one is to place metal plate over a die, with the intervening space evacuated by a vacuum pump, place the whole assembly underwater, and detonate a charge at an appropriate distance from the plate. For complicated shapes, a segmented die can be used to produce in a single operation a shape that would require many manufacturing steps, or to be manufactured in parts and welded together with an accompanying loss of strength at the welds. There is often some degree of work hardening from the explosive-forming process, particularly in mild steel. Tooling Tooling can be made out of fiberglass for short-run applications, out of concrete for large parts at medium pressures, or out of ductile iron for high-pressure work; ideally the tooling should have higher yield strength than the material that is being formed, which is a problem since the technique is usually only considered for material which is itself very hard to work. History The first commercial industrial application of explosive forming in the United States began in 1950 and was used into the 1970's by The Moore Company in Marceline, Missouri. Purpose was to form proprietary shaped metal cylinders for use as the central structure of industrial axial vane fans. This is detailed in a 1967 N.A.S.A. publication \\"High-Velocity Metalworking - a survey\\" at pages 73, 82 & 83\\\\. This article misstates the name of company founder Robert David Moore Sr. as \\"E. R. Moore\\". Moore ultimately did hold some patents for involved processes. Explosive forming was used in the 1960s for aerospace applications, such as the chine plates of the SR-71 reconnaissance plane and various Soviet rocket parts; it continued to be developed in Russia, and the organising committees of such events as EPNM tend to contain many members from the former Soviet Union. It proved particularly useful for making high-strength corrugated parts which would otherwise have to be milled out of ingots much larger than the finished product. An example would be a yacht constructor who produced boat hulls by making a concrete \\"swimming pool\\" into which sheet-metal was placed, and when water filled and explosively fired, produced a complete hull-form. Other uses of explosives for manufacturing take advantage of the shaped charge effect, putting the explosive directly in contact with the metal to be worked; this was used for engraving of thick iron plates as early as the 1890s. See also explosively formed projectiles for a variety of military applications of the same kind of technology. Explosive forming of vacuum tube anode (plate) materials In the late 1950s, the General Electric company developed an application for five-layer sheet metal composites that had been created using the explosive forming process. GE engineers used this innovative composite material to produce multi-layer vacuum tube anodes (aka \\"plates\\") with superior heat transfer characteristics. This characteristic allowed GE to build significantly higher power vacuum tubes from existing designs without expensive engineering, design, and tooling changes, providing a substantial competitive market advantage to GE in the burgeoning Hi-Fi amplifier market. In January 1960 it was reported in contemporary GE technical literaturehttp://n4trb.com/AmateurRadio/GE_HamNews/issues/GE%20Ham%20News%20Vol%2015%20No%201.pdf that this five-layer material was the design breakthrough which made possible the new 6L6GC. The 6L6GC was a 6L6 variant able to dissipate 26% more power compared to the otherwise identically constructed 6L6GB. According to General Electric engineer R.E. Moe, then Manager of Engineering at G.E,'s Owensboro Kentucky facility,http://n4trb.com/AmateurRadio/GE_HamNews/issues/GE%20Ham%20News%20Vol%2015%20No%201.pdf these increases were made possible by the application of the improved multi- layer plate material. GE sourced this material from a Texas-based firm (Texas Instrumentshttp://www.audioasylum.com/cgi/vt.mpl?f=tubes&m;=252498) which is reported to be the source of the explosively forged five-layer raw material specified by General Electric engineers. This manufacturer used explosive sheet metal forging processes previously developed for another customer (possibly the U.S. Navy?) The explosively formed dissimilar materials had substantially improved evenness of heat transfer thanks to the copper center layer. GE engineers quickly saw the potential for improved heat transfer characteristics in several already popular pentode and beam tetrode vacuum tube designs, including the 6L6GB, the 7189, and eventually the 6550. The application of the five-layer (Al-Fe-Cu-Fe-Al) material to anode manufacture solved the problem of irregular heat buildup at high power levels in the anode plates of power pentodes, tetrodes, and triodes. This irregular heat buildup leads to physical distortion of the tube's plate. if allowed to continue, this spot overheating eventually results in warpage which allows physical contact and subsequent short circuits between the plate, grids, and beam formers in the tube. Such contact shorts destroy the tube. General Electric's novel application of this innovative composite led to the creation of the 7189A variant, released in late 1959, along with the 6L6GC and other variants. By 1969, the 6550A variant had also been developed to take advantage of explosively forged composites. GE's application allowed for improved power levels in a number of already popular tube designs, an innovation which helped pave the way for substantially higher power vacuum tube stereo and musical instrument amplifiers in the 1960s and early 1970s.

The Renaissance diocese since 1558 was suppressed in 1801 during the Napoleonic and Dutch eras and restored in 1834 a pre-diocesan stage as Apostolic vicariate since 1832. Its territory coincides with West Flanders. Its cathedral episcopal see is the Sint-Salvator Cathedral, dedicated to Our Savior, in Bruges (Brugge), West Flanders province, a minor basilica a minor World Heritage Site. Its patron saint however is Saint Donatian, hence the cathedral is also known as Sint-Salvators- en Donaaskathedraal after both saints.  Statistics  As per 2014, it pastorally serves 965,000 Catholics (82.1% of 1,174,752 total) on 3,145 km¬≤ in 362 parishes and 65 missions with 708 priests (499 diocesan, 209 religious), 91 deacons, 1,986 lay religious (290 brothers, 1,696 sisters) and 7 seminarians.  History  An earlier diocese of Bruges was established on 12 May 1558, on territory split off from the Diocese of Tournai, as part of the great Habsburg reform of the church in the then Spanish Low Countries. Its cathedral see, St. Donatian's Cathedral, was destroyed in a fire in 1799 during the aftermath of the French Revolution. During the Napoleonic Concordate-period reforms, it was suppressed on 1801.07.15 and its territory merged into the Diocese of Gent (Ghent). On 1832.12.17, shortly after the independence of Belgium, it was restored as (pre-diocesan) Apostolic Administration of West-Vlaanderen ('West Flanders', the name of the Belgian province it coincides with, as most Belgian bishoprics), regaining its territory from Ghent. On 1834.05.27, this was promoted to Diocese again and renamed after its see, Brugge, while the incumbent Apostolic Administrator was promoted Suffragan Bishop. On 1967.05.31 it lost a bit of territory to the Ancient Diocese of Tournai, shortly after a reshuffle of province borders involving a few municipalities, notably Moeskroen being transferred to Hainaut (which Tournai bishopric covers). In 1985 the diocese enjoyed a papal visit from Pope John Paul II, who on 17 May gave a homily on the horrors of war at Ypres as part of his pastoral visit to the Low Countries.https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul- ii/it/homilies/1985/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19850517_ieper.html A pederasty scandal saw its self-confessed, hardly remorseful bishop Roger Vangheluwe forced into 'early emeritate', traumatizing the entire Belgian church.

Club career Bilica is infamous for his statement during his time at Venezia when during a game against Brescia he claimed that he would break the legs of Roberto Baggio. Baggio wound up getting injured and stayed on the sidelines for several months, but the tackle was made by Antonio Marasco. Bilica made his debut at Bahia. He then later played for clubs including Palermo, K√∂ln and many more. In 2004, Bilica was approached by Goi√°s Esporte Clube, as part of the manager Celso Roth's preparations for the 2004 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A. However, the negotiations with the Goi√¢nia club did not go as expected. Bilica was then signed by the Porto Alegre club Gr√™mio. At Gr√™mio, F√°bio Bilica was part of the squad that was relegated to the S√©rie B. In a disastrous campaign, Gr√™mio was virtually relegated with four rounds to go to the end of the season, and Bilica was dismissed by the team after problems with the club, such as a verbal altercation with heckling fans, arguments with the coach Cl√°udio Duarte, and for the poor campaign and financial conditions of the club. Bilica was released by the club after the end of the season, amidst problems with the club president, Paulo Odone, and allegations of indiscipline and improper conduct. In November 2007, he arrived in Romania, at Universitatea Cluj, there he played in 17 matches and in the last game of the season which was the Cluj derby against CFR Cluj, Bilica fouled an opponent in his own penalty area, so CFR Cluj scored their winning goal. After this match, it was suspected that he did not play fair against CFR Cluj, helping them to win the Romanian championship instead of Steaua Bucharest. He later stated in an interview that he was contacted by some players from CFR Cluj with three days before the match who tried to convince him to \\"take it easy\\" against them, telling him they have a lot of money for him, but he refused. Bilica signed for Sivasspor in July 2008 and caught the attention of Fenerbah√ße. He later signed with Fenerbah√ße on 8 June 2009 in exchange for Yasin √áakmak and ‚Ç¨1.5 million.

The EP consists of four tracks recorded during sessions for their first album Mot√∂rhead, in 1977 at Escape Studios, Kent, England, but were previously unreleased. The EP was released by Big Beat Records, a subsidiary of Chiswick Records, who the band were signed to when the tracks were recorded in 1977. The release was not authorized by the band, though they did not oppose it. Background All four tracks were recorded during the 1977 Mot√∂rhead album sessions and were regarded as outtakes. As such, they only saw a belated release after Ace of Spades peaked at No. 4 on the UK Albums ChartBurridge, Alan Illustrated Collector's Guide to Mot√∂rhead Published: 1995, Collector's Guide Publishing p70. . in 1980. Despite the band's success at that time, the EP failed to make any impact on the UK charts. A few years later, Chiswick label boss Ted Carroll would again raid his label archives to give a retrospective release of a live recording from the same era, called What's Words Worth?. Lemmy has stated about Ted Carroll's Chiswick Records back catalogue releases: \\"He's a great geezer and if it wasn't for Ted there wouldn't be any Mot√∂rhead anyway, so Ted has carte blanche, he can do what he wants with the old catalogue.\\" Recording The original ZZ Top version of \\"Beer Drinkers & Hell Raisers\\", recorded for their 1973 album Tres Hombres, features vocal lines traded between guitarist Billy Gibbons and bassist Dusty Hill, with the two alternating each line. Mot√∂rhead's version replicated this arrangement, with bassist Lemmy and guitarist \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke trading lines. This marked Clarke's debut as a lead vocalist, and also represented one of the very few occasions in which a Mot√∂rhead song (the others being \\"Step Down,\\" \\"I'm Your Witchdoctor\\" and \\"Emergency\\") featured vocals from someone other than Lemmy. An earlier version of \\"On Parole\\" had been recorded by the band in 1975 for an album for United Artists that was ultimately shelved, and ex-guitarist Larry Wallis released a version as a B-side to his 1977 Stiff Records single \\"Police Car\\". The song was a mainstay in Mot√∂rhead's early setlist, as exemplified on What's Words Worth?, though it was dropped permanently sometime after 1979 as the band's repertoire grew. \\"I'm Your Witchdoctor\\" (\\"a great song,\\" Lemmy pronounces in his 2002 autobiography) is a John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers cover which was another mainstay of the band's setlist circa 1977-78. \\"Instro\\", the EP's only original composition, is a rare instrumental track from the band which is believed to have never been finished due to inadequate studio time during the 1977 sessions it was culled from. Release The vinyl EP was issued as a 7\\" pressing (NS61) and as a 12\\" pressing (SWT61), both formats were pressed in black, blue, orange, pink and white vinyl and there was also a 7\\" 'Radio Play' Sleeve.Burridge, Alan Illustrated Collector's Guide to Mot√∂rhead Published: 1995, Collector's Guide Publishing . Along with the Mot√∂rhead single's B-side, \\"City Kids,\\" the tracks from this EP were included on the 1988 CD reissue of Mot√∂rhead by Big Beat Records. In 1982 Big Beat Records released German and French editions that added the extra tracks \\"Vibrator,\\" \\"White Line Fever,\\" \\"City Kids,\\" \\"Keep Us on the Road,\\" \\"Lost Johnny\\" and \\"Mot√∂rhead.\\" It was released in the usual black vinyl (A 120 174) and as a picture disc (PD 120 174). It has been bonus tracks on the original album Mot√∂rhead since Big Beat Records reissue added them in 1988, and subsequently by Chiswick and Ace Records in 2001 for its remastered release. In his 2011 book Overkill: The Untold Story of Mot√∂rhead, biographer Joel McIver derides the EP's title, saying \\"This is an early example of many, many attempts by the various record companies who ruined, I mean handled, Mot√∂rhead's career to mould them into less sophisticated versions of themselves.\\" Track listing Track listing - 1982 Release Personnel Per the Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers liner notes. * Lemmy Kilmister ‚Äì lead vocals, bass * \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals, co-lead vocals on \\"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers\\" and \\"I'm Your Witch Doctor\\" * Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor ‚Äì drums Production *Speedy Keen ‚Äì producer *John Burns ‚Äì engineer *Adam Skeaping ‚Äì mastering *Mot√∂rhead ‚Äì executive producers References 1980 EPs Mot√∂rhead EPs ","title":"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers"},{"id":"14393851","text":"Morris Gachamba (born 1932) is a basement mechanic in Kenya, a country in East Africa.

The French attacked the archduke's forces, but they were resisted until the arrival of reinforcements decided the engagement in favor of the Austrians. The French retreated west toward the Rhine River. The action occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. W√ºrzburg is southeast of Frankfurt. The summer of 1796 saw the two French armies of Jourdan and Jean Victor Marie Moreau advance into southern Germany. They were opposed by Archduke Charles, who supervised two weaker Austrian armies commanded by Wilhelm von Wartensleben and Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour. At the Battle of Amberg on 24 August, Charles managed to concentrate superior numbers against Jourdan, forcing him to withdraw. At W√ºrzburg, Jourdan attempted a counterattack in a bid to halt his retreat. After his defeat, Charles forced Jourdan's army back to the Rhine. With his colleague in retreat, Moreau was isolated and compelled to abandon southern Germany.

Jourdan's plan was to attack Szt√°ray with the divisions of Generals of Division Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte and Jean √âtienne Championnet, leaving the divisions of Generals of Division Jacques Bonnaud and Paul Grenier in reserve. However, the early morning mist enabled Archduke Charles to bring up the division of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze as a reinforcement to Szt√°ray, effectively undoing what Jourdan thought to be a great numerical superiority for the French. Jourdan's imagined superiority diminished even more when the division of General-Major Anton von Elsnitz to the north kept the much larger force under General of Division Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre out of the battle. Meanwhile, Austrian engineers were laying pontoon bridges over the Main in order to let the remainder of the Habsburg army cross the river. The French attacked the Austrian position without success until the Austrian divisions of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Paul Kray and Feldzeugmeister Wilhelm von Wartensleben arrived and drove the French off the field. Result Army of the Lower Rhine The French suffered 2,000 killed and wounded, plus 1,000 men and 7 guns captured. The Austrians lost 1,200 killed and wounded, with 300 captured.Rothenberg, p 248. Rothenberg gives 44,000 as the Austrian strength, which may include Elsnitz's division. Smith's strengths were used instead. The Battle of W√ºrzburg determined the winner of the 1796 campaign in southern Germany. Charles pursued the beaten French, turning Jourdan's south flank and keeping between him and General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau's French Army of Rhin-et-Moselle in southern Germany. On 7 September, Charles forced the French to lift the siege of Mainz.Smith, p 122 By 16 September, the opposing armies were back on the Lahn River where they started the campaign in June. On that day, Kray with 11,000 Austrians defeated 15,000 Frenchmen of Jourdan's army at Limburg an der Lahn. The French general fell back to D√ºsseldorf and crossed to the west bank of the Rhine. The French gave up their siege of the Ehrenbreitstein fortress on 17 September. Charles left 30,000 soldiers with the Army of the Lower Rhine, placed them under the command Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz von Werneck, and hurried south.Smith, p 124 Army of the Upper Rhine Having disposed of Jourdan's army, the Austrian archduke forced Moreau's now-isolated army to retreat west through the Black Forest to France.Eggenberger, p 482 On 18 September, an Austrian division under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Petrasch stormed the Rhine bridgehead at Kehl, but was driven out by a French counterattack. At this time, Moreau's army was still south of Ulm. On 2 October, Moreau defeated Feldzeugmeister Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour's Army of the Upper Rhine at the Battle of Biberach. While French casualties numbered only 500, they inflicted 300 killed and wounded, while capturing 4,000 soldiers and 18 cannon.Smith, p 123 This slowed the southern Austrian pursuit, but with Charles rushing south to cut him off from France, Moreau retreated to the Rhine. On 19 October, Moreau with 32,000 soldiers fought Charles with 28,000 Austrians at the Battle of Emmendingen. The French suffered 1,000 killed and wounded, including General of Division Michel de Beaupuy killed. In addition, the Austrians captured 1,800 men and 2 cannons. The Austrians losses totaled 1,000, including Feldzeugmeister Wilhelm von Wartensleben killed.Smith, p 123‚Äì124 The French withdrew south and fought the Battle of Schliengen on 24 October. This time, the Austrians lost 800 while inflicting 1,200 casualties on the French. Both sides claimed victory, but Moreau retreated to the west bank of the Rhine. Moreau soon offered Charles an armistice, which the field marshal wanted to accept. At this time, the Austrian government made a huge error by refusing to ratify the agreement. That fall and winter, while Charles reduced the fortresses of Kehl and Huningen, the French government transferred 14 demi-brigades from Moreau to General of Division Napoleon Bonaparte to help the latter bring the Siege of Mantua to a successful conclusion.Smith, p 125‚Äì126 Notes References  * See also * Conflicts in 1796 Battles involving Austria 1796 in Austria 1796 in France Battles of the War of the First Coalition 1796 in the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Battle of W√ºrzburg"},{"id":"14393873","text":"The Diocese of Oppido Mamertina-Palmi () is a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical territory in southern Italy, existing under that name since 1979.

The Chapter of the Cathedral already existed in the 13th century. The Chapter maintained its right to elect a new bishop until 1338.Zerbi, pp. 98-99. The Chapter was composed of six dignities (the Archdeacon, the Dean, the Cantor, the Treasurer, the Archpriest, and the Ecclesiarch-Theologian) and fourteen Canons.D'Avino, pp. 505-506. In 1472 the see was united to that of Gerace, under Bishop Athanasius Calceofilo, by whom the Greek Rite was abolished, although it remained in use in a few towns. In 1536 Oppido became again an independent see, under Bishop Pietro Andrea Ripanti; among other bishops were Antonio Cesconi (1609) and Giovanni Battista Montani (1632), who restored the cathedral and the episcopal palace; Bisanzio Fili (1696), who founded the seminary; Michele Caputo (1852), who was transferred to the See of Ariano, where it is suspected that he poisoned King Ferdinand II; eventually, he apostatized. In 1748 the town of Oppido is estimated to have had 2,000 inhabitants.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 318, note 1. The town was heavily damaged by the earthquakes of 1783, in the first of which Oppido was at the epicenter, and the population decimated by the plague that followed.D'Avino, p. 507, column 2.

He was one of the founders of the Royal Society and served as its president from 1682 to 1683. Between 1685 and 1687 he also represented Herefordshire in the House of Commons. Life He was the eldest son of Sir Bennet Hoskyns, 1st Baronet, of Harewood and Morehampton Park, Herefordshire, and grandson of Serjeant John Hoskins, born in Herefordshire on 23 July 1634. He was educated in the rudiments of Latin by his mother, Anne, daughter of Sir John Bingley of Temple Combe, Somerset, and was later sent to Westminster School under Richard Busby. Sir John married Jane, eldest daughter of Sir Gabriel Lowe of Newark, Gloucestershire by Ann Hungerford of South Marston. They lived at Harewood End, as did Jane continue in widowhood until 1724 when she died, and was buried in the church there. They left a large family. Of these Sir Bennet Hoskyns succeeded as 3rd baronet. His brother Sir Hungerford was the 4th baronet married to Mary, daughter of the Lord Chandos. Younger brother John was MA and Rector of Peterstow. Hoskyns was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, and although he may have practised, acquired a reputation as a lawyer, and was made a master in chancery bench. In 1680 he succeeded his father in the baronetcy (having been knighted previously), and five years later was chosen Member of Parliament for Herefordshire; but was not active in politics. Hoskyns was elected President of the Royal Society in 1682, in succession to his friend Sir Christopher Wren. His friends included Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford, John Evelyn, and John Aubrey. Sir John was elected to parliament called on the death of Charles II for Herefordshire. He resigned the chair the following year, but from 1685 to 1687 was secretary. He died on 12 September 1705, and was buried at Harewood, Herefordshire. Family Hoskyns married Jane, daughter of Sir Gabriel Low, and his two sons, Bennet and Hungerford (d. 1766), were third and fourth baronets successively.

The phenomenon is rare compared to other forms of propagation (such as sporadic E propagation, or E-skip) but can reflect signals thousands of miles beyond their intended broadcast area, substantially farther than E-skip. F2-skip affects the upper ends of the high frequency (HF) spectrum and the low ends of the very high frequency (VHF) spectrum; only a small portion of F2's effective range overlaps frequencies used by consumer broadcast reception, also contributing to the phenomenon being rarely encountered. Solar activity has a cycle of approximately 11 years. During this period, sunspot activity rises to a peak and gradually falls again to a low level. When sunspot activity increases, the reflecting capabilities of the F1 layer surrounding earth enable high frequency short- wave communications. The highest-reflecting layer, the F2 layer, which is approximately 200 miles (320 km) above earth, receives ultraviolet radiation from the sun, causing ionisation of the gases within this layer. During the daytime when sunspot activity is at a maximum, the F2 layer can become intensely ionized due to radiation from the sun. When solar activity is sufficiently high, the MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency) rises, hence the ionisation density is sufficient to reflect signals well into the 30-60 MHz VHF spectrum. Since the MUF progressively increases, F2 reception on lower frequencies can indicate potential low band 45-55 MHz VHF TV as well as VHF amateur radio paths. A rising MUF will initially affect the 27 MHz CB band, and the amateur 28 MHz 10 meters band before reaching 45-55 MHz TV and the 6 meters amateur band. The F2 MUF generally increases at a slower rate compared to the Es MUF. Since the height of the F2 layer is some 200 miles (320 km), it follows that single-hop F2 signals will be received at thousands rather than hundreds of miles. A single-hop F2 signal will usually be around 2,000 miles (3,200 km) minimum. A maximum F2 single-hop can reach up to approximately 3,000 miles (4,800 km). Multi-hop F2 propagation has enabled Band 1 VHF reception to over 11,000 miles (17,700 km). Since F2 reception is directly related to radiation from the Sun on both a daily basis and in relation to the sunspot cycle, it follows that for optimum reception the centre of the signal path will be roughly at midday. The F2 layer tends to predominantly propagate signals below 30 MHz (HF) during a solar minimum, which includes the 27 MHz CB radio, and 28 MHz 10-meter amateur radio band. During a solar maximum, television, amateur radio signals, private land mobile, and other services in the 30-60 MHz VHF spectrum are also propagated over considerable distances. In North America, F2 is most likely to only affect VHF TV channel 2, in Europe and middle east channel E2 and E3 (and the now deprecated channel itA) and in eastern Europe channel R1. Television pictures propagated via F2 tend to suffer from characteristic ghosting and smearing. Picture degradation and signal strength attenuation increases with each subsequent F2 hop. Notable F2 DX receptions * In November 1938, 405-line video from the BBC Alexandra Palace television station (London, England) on channel B1 (45.0 MHz) was received in New York, USA. * In 1958, the FM broadcast radio DX record was set by DXer Gordon Simkin in southern California, United States, when he logged a 45 MHz commercial FM station from Korea via trans-Pacific F2 propagation at a distance of 5,000 miles (8,000 km). * In October 1979, Anthony Mann (Perth, Western Australia) received 48.25 MHz audio and 51.75 MHz video from the Holme Moss BBC channel B2 television transmitter. This F2 reception is a world record for reception from a BBC 405-line channel B2 transmitter. * During October to December 1979, United Kingdom DXers Roger Bunney (Hampshire), Hugh Cocks (Sussex), Mike Allmark (Leeds), and Ray Davies (Norwich) all received viewable television pictures from Australian channel TVQ 0 Brisbane (46.26 MHz) via multi-hop F2 propagation. * On January 31, 1981, Todd Emslie, Sydney, Australia, received 41.5 MHz channel B1 television audio transmitted from Crystal Palace Transmitter by the BBC's television service, 10,560 miles (16,990 km) away. This BBC B1 reception was also recorded on to audio tape. He has also received Dubai's DCRTV 48.25 MHz video on November 23, 1991 in the same place.

Description The village of Crosby is situated in the center of the parish of Marown on the primary A1 Douglas to Peel at the cross-road junction with the A23 Mount Rule Road and the B35 Garth Road. It has a population of about 900. The River Dhoo flows to the south of Crosby village through the main Douglas to Peel Central valley. Village Marown Old Church ‚Äì St Runius The old St Runius church, which was the original Marown parish church until the new church was built in 1859, is located in Crosby. Part of the old church dates back to the 12th century. It was expanded in 1754. When the new church was built, the original church was used as a mortuary chapel and part of the east side was demolished. The building was eventually restored and re-opened on 9 August 1959, with services now held regularly each summer and or major festivals. The village also has a Methodist chapel. Crosby Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was opened on 6 October 1833. Marown Language Centre (), a foreign language teaching facility and training centre for teachers on the island is located in Crosby, close to the old St Runius Church. The village's historic railway station opened on 1 July 1873 and last operated on 7 September 1968 when the line closed. It was on the Douglas to Peel line of the Isle of Man Railway which now forms the Heritage Trail, following the course of the old line. The station was demolished but the crossing keeper's cottage on the east side is now a shelter for walkers on the trail. Local amenities in Crosby include a children's play park, football and cricket pitch, chapel and pub, which is also a popular spectator spot for watching the Isle of Man TT. Sport Marown F.C. is a football club which competes in the Isle of Man Football League playing home games at the Memorial Playing Fields in Crosby. The village also has the Crosby Cricket Club which shares the same site. Founded in 1946, the club is part of the Isle of Man Cricket Association.

It has a population of 532. The parish includes the hamlets of Cole and Godminster. The village lies on the River Pitt and other streams that flow into the River Brue. Godminster Lane Quarry and Railway Cutting is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest important for study of the Inferior Oolite limestones of Middle Jurassic age. The rocks do contain the rich assemblage of fossil ammonites typical of the north Dorset/south Somerset area. It is also important as a reference site for three sub-divisions (zones) of the Inferior Oolite ‚Äî the laeviscula, discites and concavum Zones.English Nature citation sheet for the site (accessed 10 August 2006) History The name Pitcombe means \\"the marshy valley\\". Evidence of prehistoric activity has been found near Godminster Farm, where a Roman coin hoard was also discovered. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the manor was held by Turstin FitzRolf and already had two watermills. Pitcombe was part of the hundred of Bruton. It was on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, now disused. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wincanton Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Landmarks Hadspen house and garden is within the parish. The house was built for William Player in the late 17th century, but has undergone several major restorations. It is built of Cary stone ashlar, with a hipped Welsh slate roof behind parapets and stone chimney stacks. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. There is still a working quarry within the parish of pitcombe, notably Hadspen Quarry Ltd located in Higher Hadspen. They provide the stone to the locality which gives this area in South Somerset its local unique characteristics of honey coloured buildings. Gants Mill is an 18th-century watermill with 13th- century origins. It is a Grade II* listed building and now has a turbine producing hydroelectricity. Godminster Manor is a 15th-century manor house which underwent extensive restoration following a fire in 1924. Cole Manor dates from the 17th century. The dismantled Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway passes through the village over a viaduct. At the north of the village is the old Cole Railway Station. The village is the home of Bruton School for Girls. Religious sites The church, dedicated to St Leonard, has a 15th-century tower at the west end containing six bells. The church was rebuilt, with the exception of its tower, in 1858. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.

For output y, at date t and a vector of m input prices p, the generalized-Ozaki cost, c, is : c(p,y,t) = \\\\sum_i b_{ii} \\\\left( y^{b_{yi}}e^{b_{ti}t} p_i + \\\\sum_{j\\\\,:\\\\,j eq i} b_{ij} \\\\sqrt{p_ip_j} y^{b_y} e^{b_tt}\\\\right). Discussion In econometrics it is often desirable to have a model of the cost of production of a given output with given inputs--or in common terms, what it will cost to produce some number of goods at prevailing prices, or given prevailing prices and a budget, how much can be made. Generally there are two parts to a cost function, the fixed and variable costs involved in production. The marginal cost is the change in the cost of production for a single unit. Most cost functions then take the price of the inputs and adjust for different factors of production, typically, technology, economies of scale, and elasticities of inputs. Traditional cost functions include Cobb‚ÄìDouglas and the constant elasticity of substitution models. These are still used because for a wide variety of activities, effects such as varying ability to substitute materials does not change. For example, for people running a bake sale, the ability to substitute one kind of chocolate chip for another will not vary over the number of cookies they can bake. However, as economies of scale and changes in substitution become important models that handle these effects become more useful, such as the transcendental log cost function. The traditional forms are economically homothetic. This means they can be expressed as a function, and that function can be broken into an outer part and an inner part. The inner part will appear once as a term in the outer part, and the inner part will be monotonically increasing, or to say it another way, it never goes down. However, empirically in the areas of trade and production, homoethetic and monolithic functional models do not accurately predict results. One example is in the gravity equation for trade, or how much will two countries trade with each other based on GDP and distance. This led researchers to explore non-homothetic models of production, to fit with a cross section analysis of producer behavior, for example, when producers would begin to minimize costs by switching inputs, or investing in increased production.

The series was a QM Production in association with Selmur Productions, Inc. Synopsis The series stars Leslie Nielsen as the serious Lieutenant Price Adams who worked on \\"The Hot Shot Detail\\" of the LAPD's Metro Squad and former Major League Baseball player John Beradino as Sergeant Vince Cavelli. The script for the first episode, \\"No Fat Cops,\\" was written by Hank Searls, credited as the creator of the series.

It has existed as a diocese since the fourth or fifth centuries. In the 11th century it was elevated to an archdiocese. In 1203 it was united with the diocese of Matera to form the Archdiocese of Acerenza and Matera. This was separated again in 1954, recreating the Archdiocese of Acerenza, which briefly became the Diocese of Acerenza in 1976 before reverting to an archdiocese in 1977. Its metropolitan is the Archdiocese of Potenza-Muro Lucano-Marsico Nuovo. History Acerenza was certainly an episcopal see in the course of the fifth century, for in 499 we meet with the name of its first known bishop, Justus, in the Acts of the Roman Synod of that year. The town was known in antiquity as the \\"high nest of Acherontia\\".Horace, Odes, III, iv, 14 Acerenza was in early imperial times a populous and important town, and a bulwark of the territory of Lucania and Apulia. In the Gothic and Lombard period it fell into decay, but was restored by Grimoald II, Duke of Beneventum (687-689). An Archbishop of Acerenza (Giraldus) appears in 1063 in an act of donation of Robert Guiscard to the monastery of the Santissima Trinit√† in Venosa. For a few years after 968 Acerenza adopted the Greek Rite in consequence of an order of the Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus Phocas (963-969), whereby it was made one of five suffragans of the archdiocese of Otranto, and compelled to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople.Moroni, Dizionario, L, 63. Pope Urban VI (1378‚Äì89, Bartolommeo Prignano), was once Archbishop of Acerenza. Acerenza Cathedral is one of the oldest and most beautiful cathedrals in Italy, known for a bust long supposed to be that of Saint Canius, patron of the city, to whom the cathedral is dedicated, but now judged to be a portrait-bust of Julian the Apostate, though others maintain that it is a bust of the Emperor Frederick II, after the manner of the sculptors of the Antonine age.

The term is usually applied to blackjack but can apply to other games with hidden hole cards, like three card poker and Caribbean stud poker. So long as it does not involve the use of a device like a mirror or actions like touching the dealer's cards, in most jurisdictions hole carding is a legal form of advantage gambling in casino table games. In other games, like stud poker, casinos normally have rules against rubbernecking or having a confederate stand behind an opponent to signal hole cards. Blackjack players must usually make playing decisions based on only seeing one of the dealer's cards (the upcard). But if the dealer's hole card is spotted, a player who plays correctly has a theoretical advantage of up to 13% instead of the normal player disadvantage of around 0.5%. A hole-card player will often choose not to make certain plays, such as hitting a hard 19 against a dealer 20, so as not to reveal that he can see the dealer's hole card. This technique is not applicable in most games outside of the United States where the second dealer card is normally not dealt until all players have played. Strategies A normal blackjack strategy has ten columns, for an ace through dealer ten value card. Strategy tables for hole carding differ from normal blackjack tables as they include a column for each possible total dealer hand instead of simply the visible card. Below is a sample hole card hit/stand table for six decks, stand on soft-17. The columns are based on the dealer hand and the rows based on the player hand. Green denotes a hit. center First-basing and spooking One method of hole carding is to peek at the card when the dealer checks the hole card for blackjack. This is called \\"first-basing\\". A modification called \\"spooking\\" refers to a partner with a better view peeking at the hole card in the same circumstance and communicating the information to the player. Peeking devices have made these methods largely obsolete. Front-loading Front-loading refers to observing the hole card as it is slid under the upcard. Newer methods of hole-carding concentrate on observation before the down card is placed under the upcard. This provides information about the card even if the dealer upcard is not a ten or an ace. The advantage varies depending on the rules, the percentage of cards seen, and the strategies used. Partial information At times the player will see a corner of the hole card, but not enough to determine the exact card. For example, if there is no pip in the corner, the card may be an ace, 2 or 3. Or, if there is a pip in the corner, it is a 4-10, but not a face card. To make use of this additional information, a different set of strategy tables must be used depending on the set of possible cards in the hole. Below is a sample blackjack, partial hole card hit/stand table for two decks. The columns are based on the dealer upcard and the rows based on the player hand. Partial hole card tables contain ten columns as the dealer's total hand is not known with complete certainty. A different set of tables must be used depending on the information acquired from the hole card. In this table, the hole card is a six or seven. Green denotes a hit. One might note that this table bears little resemblance to standard blackjack strategy. center  Next card play  Hole carding generally refers to knowing the dealer‚Äôs hole card. Next card play refers to knowing the next card to be dealt. If a round has not started, and a player knows what his or her first card will be, one can simply alter one's bet depending on the value of that card. In a game like blackjack, if the dealer has already dealt a player's first two cards, and the player knows the next card to be dealt, it becomes possible for playing decisions to be altered to include this additional information. Strategies are significantly more complex as there exists a different strategy table for each possible next card. Strategies may also differ depending on a player's position in the dealing rotation: * First Seat ‚Äì If the player does not take the known card, another player gets it. * Last Seat ‚Äì If the player does not take the card, the dealer may draw it. This also applies in a situation where no player to one's left is likely to draw a card. * No hole card ‚Äì In a no- hole-card game, if the player does not take the card, it may become the dealer‚Äôs second card. Other methods * Warped cards ‚Äì In a casino where a blackjack dealer bends the hole card to check for a blackjack, the cards can become warped. The warps can be later used to determine the value of a face down card. This method is largely obsolete as most casinos use devices instead of bending cards to determine dealer blackjacks, and cards are regularly replaced with new decks. * Dealer tells ‚Äì When a blackjack dealer checks for a blackjack, some dealers may give clues as to the value of the down card, akin to Poker tells. Again, most casinos now use devices to check the down card, rendering this obsolete in most casinos. * Peeking at other players' cards ‚Äì Depending on the game and casino, this may or may not be acceptable and may aid player decisions. * Counting by inference ‚Äì In blackjack where player cards are dealt face down, the actions of other players can provide clues as to their hidden cards. This is less valuable in modern casinos due to the fewer number of single-deck games and reduction in penetration (how deeply the dealer deals before shuffling.)

Ehrenzweig was born into an eminent Jewish legal family in Vienna with Czech and Galician roots. He was the son of Emma (n√©e Bachrach) from Neuhaus in Southern Bohemia and Albert Rudolf Ehrenzweig, who was born in Vienna. His paternal grandfather and grandmother were from Lipn√≠k nad Beƒçvou (Leipnik) in Moravia and Lemberg, Galicia (now Lviv, Ukraine), respectively. He studied law, psychology and art in Austria and became a magistrate in 1936. He fled Austria immediately after the Anschluss with Germany in 1938 and settled in England with his brother (Albert Ehrenzweig) and parents following him later that year. In 1940 he was interned by the British authorities as an enemy alien & transported to Australia. He (along with all other Jewish internees) was released in 1942. He abandoned his law career after returning to London while his brother who left for America in 1939 started an entirely new career there in the Common Law and became an eminent Conflicts of Laws professor at Berkeley California. After working at the Central School of Arts & Crafts in Holborn London Anton Ehrenzweig eventually became a lecturer in Art Education at Goldsmiths College, University of London. He devoted his life's work to the study of the creative mind. Ehrenzweig had an instinct for recognizing upcoming artists when they were unknown and during his career he helped and advised Eduardo Paolozzi, Bridget Riley and Alan Davie among other artists. Ehrenzweig wrote The Psychoanalysis of Artistic Vision and Hearing (1953)Ehrenzweig A (1953) The Psychoanalysis of Artistic Vision and Hearing New York, Geo Braziller and The Hidden Order of Art (1967).Ehrenzweig A (1967) The Hidden Order of Art Paladin Ehrenzweig also published numerous journal articles.Ehrenzweig A (1949)'The Origin of the Scientific and Heroic Urge' Intern J Psychoanal 30/2, 1949Ehrenzweig A (1960) 'Alienation versus Self-Expression' The Listener LXIII 1613 1960Ehrenzweig A (1964) 'The Undifferentiated Matrix of Artistic Imagination' The Psychoanalytic Study of Society III 1964Ehrenzweig A (1965) 'Towards a Theory of Art Education' (A Report) Goldsmiths College University of LondonEhrenzweig A (1965) 'Bridget Riley's pictorial Space' Art International IX/I 1965 His ideas can be summarized as the discovery of the organizing role of the unconscious mind in any act of creativity and an analysis of the layered structure of the unconscious mind and of the dynamic mental processes which an artist undergoes in the creative act. The Hidden Order of Art, published posthumously, has been in continuous publication since 1967, and is considered one of the three classics of art psychology, along with Rudolf Arnheim's Art and Visual Perception and Herschel Chipp's Theories of Modern Art. Ehrenzweig wrote the introduction to the catalogue for an early show by Bridget RIley at London's Gallery One, May 1962. He also reviewed one of her exhibitions for \\"Art International\\" in February 1965. He died the following year in Hammersmith, London, of a sudden heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Gerda Hiller, whom he married in 1942. They had one child Anthony Ehrenzweig born 1945. Sir Herbert Read commented on Ehrenzweig's contribution following his death: > The Psychoanalysis of Artistic Vision and Hearing ... advanced an original > theory of the part played by-unconscious modes of perception in the creation > of the work of art. Essentially a merging of Freudian psycho-analysis and > Gestalt psychology, this thesis established the importance of the interplay > that takes place between our conscious and formal creation of images and our > undisciplined perceptive imagination.

Biography He began his writing career as a journalist for national newspapers, where he met Giovanni Verga and Luigi Capuana, the most prominent writers of the Verismo style. Verga introduced him into the literary circles of Milan. De Roberto authored two books of short stories: La Sorte (1887), Documenti umani (1888). His first novel, Ermanno Raeli, (1889) is largely autobiographical; deeper in psychological analysis is the second, L'illusione (1891). In 1894 his novel I Vicer√© was published. It was the result of years of hard work, but obtained little success upon its release. Disillusionment and nervous disorders induced De Roberto to resume journalistic work: he became a writer for the Corriere della Sera and the Giornale d'Italia. Only later, after some experience as a playwright, he returned to the novel, with L'Imperio, sequel to I Vicer√© (1908‚Äì1913, unfinished). I Vicer√© The novel consists of three parts and is based upon the story of a noble family of Catania, of Spanish origins. This family, the Uzeda princes of Francalanza, were during the previous Spanish rule \\"Vicer√©\\" (that is, they represented the monarch). The plot, fictional but very accurate in describing social and political background, follows the private history of the Uzedas during the last year of Bourbon domination in the kingdom of Two Sicilies and the first decades of Regno d'Italia. It portrays the evolution from feudal rule to a parliamentary system. De Roberto uses the literary style of Verismo (the Italian version of Naturalism). There is no privileged point of view (neither of the author nor others), but rather a plurality of voices. Mass scenes are powerful, and the description of various social backgrounds is rich and deep. The primary aim of all members of the Uzeda family is to retain power regardless of the changes that occur, even if this requires actions that the reader will undoubtedly judge to be cynical, or even absurd. De Roberto portrays a world undergoing fundamental change, but seemingly holds no hope for the future: no aspect of society is represented as free from corruption. Ths novel has been adapted to cinema by director Roberto Faenza in 2007.

Cast * Harold Lloyd as Billy Blazes * Bebe Daniels as Nell * Snub Pollard as Sheriff 'Gun Shy' Gallagher (as Harry Pollard) * Sammy Brooks * Billy Fay * Noah Young (uncredited) Synopsis In the misnamed western hamlet of Peaceful Vale, where gun play is commonplace, there has not been a murder in 20 minutes. The father and daughter co-proprietors of a local saloon are harassed by the leader of a violent mob who attempts to run the father out of the country while holding his pretty daughter, Nell, hostage. Heroic Billy Blazes arrives in time to free the father, rescue Nell, and escape with her to safety. The film's final scene, set \\"three years later\\", shows Nell and Billy as the parents of a large and happy family, whose children are clearly more than three years old. Although the film is only 13 minutes long, the title character does not appear until five minutes into film.

From 1882 to 1921 all of Ireland was represented by a single side, the Ireland national football team, organised by the Irish Football Association (IFA). In 1920 Ireland was partitioned into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. In 1922, The south of Ireland gained independence as the Irish Free State, later to become Republic of Ireland. Amid these political upheavals, a rival football association, the Football Association of Ireland (the F.A.I.), emerged in Dublin in 1921 and organised a separate league and later a national team. In 1923, during a period when the home nations had dis-affiliated from the governing body, Google books the FAI was recognised by FIFA as the governing body of the Irish Free State on the condition that it changed its name to the Football Association of the Irish Free State. At the same time, the IFA continued to organise its national team on an all-Ireland basis, regularly calling up Free State players. During this era at least one Northerner, Harry Chatton, also played for the Irish Free State and from 1936, the FAI began to organise their own all‚ÄìIreland team. Both teams now competed as Ireland and during this era at least 39 dual internationals were selected to represent both teams. Between 1928 and 1946 the IFA were not affiliated to FIFA and the two Ireland teams co-existed, never competing in the same competition. In April 1951, FIFA decreed that the IFA team could not select \\"citizens of Eire\\". An exception was for British Home Championship games, as a 1923 IFAB agreement at Liverpool prevented FIFA intervention in relations between the four Home Nations. However, the exception would only apply \\"if the F.A. of Ireland do not object\\", and was never availed of. At FIFA's 1953 congress, its Rule 3 was amended so that an international team must use \\"that title ... recognised politically and geographically of the countries or territories\\". The FAI initially claimed Rule 3 gave them the right to the name Ireland (see names of the Irish state), but FIFA subsequently ruled neither team could be referred to as Ireland, decreeing that the FAI team be officially designated as the Republic of Ireland, while the IFA team was to become Northern Ireland. The IFA objected and in 1954 was permitted to continue using the name Ireland in Home Internationals, based on the 1923 agreement. This practice was discontinued in the late 1970s.Matthew Taylor (2008). The Association Game: A History of British Football. Harlow:Pearson Education Ltd.

Cookers induction stove solar funnel cooker * AGA cooker ‚Äì a heat storage stove and cooker, which works on the principle that a heavy frame made from cast iron components can absorb heat from a relatively low-intensity but continuously-burning source, and the accumulated heat can then be used when needed for cooking. Originally heated by slow-burning coal, the Aga cooker was invented in 1922 by the Nobel Prize- winning Swedish physicist Gustaf Dal√©n (1869‚Äì1937), who was employed first as the chief engineer of the Swedish AGA company. * Cook stove ‚Äì heated by burning wood, charcoal, animal dung or crop residue. Cook stoves are commonly used for cooking and heating food in developing countries. * Electric cooker ‚Äì an electric powered cooking device for heating and cooking of food * Gas stove (British English) ‚Äì uses natural gas, propane, butane, liquefied petroleum gas or other flammable gas as a fuel source. Most modern stoves come in a unit with built-in extractor hoods. * Induction cooker ‚Äì heats a cooking vessel with induction heating, instead of infrared radiation from electrical wires or a gas flame as with a traditional cooking stove. For all models of induction cooktop, a cooking vessel must be made of a ferromagnetic metal such as cast iron or stainless steel or at least compounded with a steel inlay. Copper, glass and aluminum vessels can be placed on a ferromagnetic interface disk which enables these materials to be used. * Kitchen stove (British English) ‚Äì a kitchen appliance designed for the purpose of cooking food. Kitchen stoves rely on the application of direct heat for the cooking process and may also contain an oven, used for baking. * Pressure cooker ‚Äì heats food quickly because the internal steam pressure from the boiling liquid causes saturated steam (or \\"wet steam\\") to bombard and permeate the food. Thus, higher temperature water vapour (i.e., increased energy), which transfers heat more rapidly compared to dry air, cooks food very quickly. * Rice cooker ‚Äì also referred to as a rice steamer, is an electric kitchen appliance used to boil or steam rice. Electric rice cookers were developed in Japan, where they are known as suihanki (Jap.: ÁÇäÈ£ØÂô®). * Slow cooker ‚Äì also known as a Crock-Pot, (a trademark that is sometimes used generically in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand), is a countertop electrical cooking appliance that is used for simmering, which requires maintaining a relatively low temperature. It allows for the unattended cooking for many hours of pot roast, stews, soups, \\"boiled\\" dinners and other suitable dishes, including dips, desserts and beverages. * Solar cooker ‚Äì a device which uses the energy of direct sunlight to heat, cook or pasteurize food or drink. Many solar cookers presently in use are relatively inexpensive, low-tech devices, although some are as powerful or as expensive as traditional stoves, and advanced, large-scale solar cookers can cook for hundreds of people. * The Cooker is the given name to a coin- activated robot made out of an oven and storage cabinet that patrols the moon, as seen in the 1989 Wallace and Gromit short, A Grand Day Out. It is very protective of the moon and becomes hostile when it discovers that Wallace and Gromit have landed there. It secretly has a lifelong dream of skiing. As well as being called The Cooker, an audio adaptation of A Grand Day Out refers to it as The Moon Machine.

Regia Berolinensi. The Berlinka ('Berliner'), also Pruski skarb ('Prussian Treasure'), is the Polish name for a collection of German original manuscripts originally kept at the Prussian State Library in Berlin, which since the end of World War II are held by the Jagiellonian Library in Krak√≥w. The legal status of the documents is subject of an ongoing debate. History During the Second World War from September 1942 onwards, German authorities moved the material from Berlin to the seized abbey of Gr√ºssau (present-day Krzesz√≥w) in Prussian Lower Silesia, in order to protect it from Allied strategic bombing. When the Lower Silesian territory east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line fell under the administrative sovereignty of the Republic of Poland after the war, the Polish government secretly claimed the collection as war reparations. In the winter of 1945/1946, the inventories were removed by Polish milicja and thereafter transferred to Krak√≥w. In 1965, the Polish and the East German government signed an agreement on the return of large collections of the Prussian State Library; however, the Polish authorities kept the Berlinka's existence at the Jagiellonian Library a secret until 1977, when Polish First Secretary Edward Gierek presenting his East German counterpart Erich Honecker with seven pieces of sheet music, including Mozart's original score of The Magic Flute and Beethoven's notes for his Symphony No. 9,Der Spiegel: BEUTEKUNST-R√úCKGABE Polen stellt sich stur, 8 August 2007 as a gift. Debate Since the jurisdiction of the former eastern territories of Germany was withdrawn by the 1945 Potsdam Agreement, Poland claims that it should retain ownership of the Berlinka as compensation for Polish cultural assets destroyed or looted by Germans during the Second World War; the total worth of Polish cultural heritage destroyed by Nazi Germany, especially after the failed Warsaw Uprising in 1944, is estimated at 20 billion dollars. Rosjanie oddajƒÖ skradzione dzie≈Ça sztuki, Gazeta Wyborcza, 2007-10-14 Some German media have referred to the Berlinka as the \\"last German prisoner of war\\". The German government claims that Poland is in violation of Article 56 of the Hague Convention of 1907,Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: R√ºckgabe von Beutekunst - Die letzten deutschen Kriegsgefangenen, 26 July 2007, while the Polish side emphasizes the fact that the collections were not looted, but were situated on Polish territory after the war. After the Revolutions of 1989, the Polish‚ÄìGerman Treaty of Good Neighbourship was signed in 1991 and several negotiations have taken place in order to clarify and confirm the whereabouts of the Berlinka. Poland has undertaken several initiatives, such as in 2000 when Foreign Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski proposed establishing a Polish‚ÄìGerman foundation that would take possession of such disputed collections. However, the German government refused ‚Äì according to Bartoszewski, resulting from the fact that Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der did not realise the offer. While Germany each time is demanding that Poland return the Berlinka unconditionally, Poland refuses, claiming that Germany still has much Polish material looted during World War II, and that this should be returned to Poland in exchange. In summer 2007, Der Spiegel magazine quoted German Foreign Office representative Julia Gross as saying that proceedings over the disposition had reached a low point. Earlier, Poland had stated that return is out of the question. In 2014 Germany returned to Poland the looted painting Palace Stairs by Francesco Guardi. With this gesture, Germany hopes to restart negotiations for the return of Berlinka. Contents Jagiellonian Library, Krak√≥w The Berlinka comprises some of the most valuable holdings of the former Prussian State Library. It includes over 500,000 medieval manuscripts, early modern printings and autographs, including by Luther and Calvin, Goethe and Schiller, Hegel, and Herder. Among the holdings are notable letters from the large estate of Ludmilla Assing and her uncle Karl August Varnhagen von Ense, personal copies of the Deutsches W√∂rterbuch with hand-written notes by the Brothers Grimm German TV HR: Handexemplare des Grimmschen W√∂rterbuchs in Krakau gefunden and original musical scores by Johann Sebastian Bach (and his sons), Mozart (Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail), Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Schumann, Haydn, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Paganini, Busoni, Cherubini, and Telemann. On the other hand, the collections also comprise many manuscripts and incunables from Polish monasteries in Gniezno, Lubi≈Ñ, Mogilno, Pako≈õƒá, Parady≈º, Pelplin and Pozna≈Ñ, removed between 1820 and 1840 by Prussian authorities from the territories gained in the Partitions of Poland.(...) do s≈Çynnej Pruskiej Biblioteki Pa≈Ñstwowej w Berlinie w≈ÇƒÖczono starodruki pochodzƒÖce z klasztor√≥w w Gnie≈∫nie, Lubiniu, Mogilnie, Pako≈õci, Parady≈ºu, Pelplinie i Poznaniu.

This fetched far less than his best shells in the auctions of his collection after his death.Conchylomania Biography According to the RKD he was a pupil of Hendrik van Limborch, Carel de Moor, and Jan Wandelaar.Pieter Lyonet in the RKD He was secretary and translator (he spoke more than eight languages) for the government of the Dutch Republic. Initially he trained as a lawyer before choosing to specialize in the engraving of natural history and the work of dissection. He illustrated Theology of the insects, or demonstration of the perfections of God in all that relates to the insects (1742) of Friedrich Christian Lesser (1692‚Äì1754) and Treatise on the polyps (1744) of Abraham Trembley (1710‚Äì1784). He then decided to make his do own observations and to write his own monograph on the anatomy of the insects. His first work appeared in 1750 under the name of Anatomical treatise of the caterpillar which corrodes the wood of Willow. He illustrated 4,041 different muscles thus. He lacked the anatomical knowledge of Jan Swammerdam (1637‚Äì1680) and of Marcello Malpighi (1628‚Äì1694) and his observations show it. His book was received with scepticism which affirmed that Lyonnet imagined the details which he drew with so much precision. It was to counter these criticisms, that he put in the second edition which appears in 1752, a drawing of its instruments and a description of its method. Lyonnet planned to study the chrysalis and the adult but, sixty years old, the tiredness of his eyes obliged him to stop his projects. Lyonnet was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 14 January 1748.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVVZY00MZNrK2YCTTzVrbTFH2t3RxoAZah128gQR- NM/pubhtml References * ; Illustrations from Trait√© anatomique (1750): larva of the willow moth Image:Lyonnet 1.jpgLarva of the willow moth Image:Lyonnet 2.jpgCentral nervous system with the nerves Image:Lyonnet 3.jpgMuscles Image:Lyonnet 4.jpgHead Image:Lyonnet 5.jpgLarva of the willow moth Image:Lyonnet 6.jpgLyonet's dissecting outfit Literature * Wouter Hendrik van Seters, Pierre Lyonet, 1706‚Äì1789: Sa vie, ses collections de coquillages et de tableux ses reserches entomologiques (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1962). * Emile Hublard, Le naturaliste hollandais Pierre Lyonet: sa vie et ses oeuvres (1706‚Äì1789) d'apres des lettres in√©dites (Brussel: Leb√®gue, 1910). * Karl Maria Michael de Leeuw, Cryptology and statecraft in the Dutch Republic (Amsterdam: APA-Holland University Press, 2000) . * Koen Scholten, \\"Pierre Lyonet‚Äôs (1706‚Äì1789) Study of Insects: Displaying Virtue and Gaining Social Status through Natural History\\", Studium, vol. 11:4 (2018): 245‚Äì259. * \\"Van lezen en microscopen IV: Trembley en Lyonet\\" (Leiden: Museum Boerhaave, 1978) 1706 births 1789 deaths People from Maastricht Dutch illustrators Dutch entomologists Dutch naturalists Dutch engravers Fellows of the Royal Society Artists from Maastricht Dutch art collectors ","title":"Pierre Lyonnet"},{"id":"14395221","title":"Bahrain Air"},{"id":"14395231","text":"A Jazzed Honeymoon is a 1919 American short comedy film featuring Harold Lloyd.

She was a pioneer in Norwegian natural history education and nature conservation together with her sister, Hanna Resvoll-Holmsen. Biography Resvoll was born at V√•g√• in Oppland, Norway. She was the daughter of Hans Resvoll (1823‚Äì1908) and Julie Martine Deichman (1831‚Äì1902). She worked as a nurse in an upper-class home in Stockholm before commencing studies of natural history at the Royal Frederick University (now University of Oslo) in Kristiania 1894. She became an adept of the professor of botany, Axel Blytt. After her graduation in 1899, she went to Copenhagen where she worked at the University of Copenhagen's botanical laboratory under Professor Eugen Warming. In 1900, she returned to the University of Oslo. She was made an associate professor at the University Botanical Garden in 1902. She obtained her doctorate in 1918 on the basis of a thesis entitled On Plants Suited to a Cold and Short Summer, in which she presented studies on adaptations of alpine plants to the harsh environment. These studies were Warmingian of nature, that is they were based on meticulous observations of plant individuals--their clonal and sexual propagation, perennation etc. Thus, it was plant population ecology before that discipline was first conceived. Thekla Resvoll made a visit to Java and the botanic garden in Buitenzorg in 1923-24. She studied Fagaceous trees in the Javan flora. She found that they had hibernation buds and interpreted it as an unnecessary trait ‚Äì a rudiment from their temperate origin. She remained at the Botanical Laboratory until her retirement in 1936. Her botany classes made a resting impact on generations of Norwegian students. She also wrote a textbook on botany for high school pupils. Personal life Alongside her academic career, Thekla Resvoll took part in the women's equality movement in Norway. She was a head of the Norwegian Female Student‚Äôs Club and served on the board of the women's suffrage movement (Kvinnestemmeretsforeningen). She was married to mining engineer Andreas Holmsen (1869-1955) whose brother Gunnar Holmsen (1880‚Äì1976) was married to her sister Hanna. She was the third woman to become a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. She died in 1948 in Oslo. Selected scientific works * Resvoll, T. R., 1900.

Dewey's aesthetics have been found useful in a number of disciplines, including new media. Dewey had previously written articles on aesthetics in the 1880s and had further addressed the matter in Democracy and Education (1915). In his major work, Experience and Nature (1925), he laid out the beginnings of a theory of aesthetic experience, and wrote two important essays for Philosophy and Civilization (1931).Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  Overview  Dewey's theory is an attempt to shift the understandings of what is essential and characteristic about the art process from its physical manifestations in the ‚Äòexpressive object‚Äô to the process in its entirety, a process whose fundamental element is no longer the material ‚Äòwork of art‚Äô but rather the development of an ‚Äòexperience‚Äô. Experience is something that personally affects one's life. That is why these theories are so crucial to people's social and educational life. Such a change in emphasis does not imply, though, that the individual art object has lost significance; far from it, its primacy is clarified: one recognizes an object as the primary site for the dialectical processes of experience, as the unifying occasion for these experiences. Through the expressive object, the artist and the active observer encounter each other, their material and mental environments, and their culture at large. The description of the actual act of experiencing is drawn heavily from the biological/psychological theories Dewey expounded in his development of functional psychology. In Dewey's article on reflex arc psychology, he writes that sensory data and worldly stimulus enter into the individual via the channels of afferent sense organs and that the perception of these stimuli is a 'summation' (quote marks not needed. it was and is a valid conception of a well-researched phenomenon. it was treated generally by James in Principles of Psychology (1890) and specifically there in Chapter 3, under Summation of Stimuli: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/57628/57628-h/57628-h.htm): The biological sensory exchange between man, whom Dewey calls 'the Live Creature' in Art as Experience, and the environment, is the basis of his aesthetic theory: This quotation is a dramatic expansion of the bounds of aesthetic philosophy, for it demonstrates the connections of art with everyday experience and in doing so reminds people of the highest responsibilities that art and society and the individual have always owed to each other: To emphasize what is aesthetic about an experience is not to highlight what is apolitical or impractical or otherwise marginal about that experience; instead, it is to emphasize in what ways that experience, as aesthetic, is a 'manifestation, a record, and celebration of the life of a civilization, a means for promoting its development' and, insofar as that aesthetic experience relates to the kinds of experiences had in general, it is also the 'ultimate judgment upon the quality of a civilization.'Art as Experience p. 326 See his Experience and Nature for an extended discussion of 'Experience' in Dewey's philosophy.  Chapters  The Live Creature John Dewey offers a new theory of art and the aesthetic experience. Dewey proposes that there is a continuity between the refined experience of works of art and everyday activities and events, and in order to understand the aesthetic one must begin with the events and scenes of daily life. This idea stands in opposition to the aesthetic theories presented by Immanuel Kant and also the proponents of German Idealism, which have historically been shown to favor certain heavily classicized forms of art, known commonly as 'High Art' or Fine Art. Dewey argues for the validity of 'popular art' stating: The continuity of aesthetic experience must be recovered with the normal processes of living. It is the duty of the theorist to make this connection and its implications clear. If art were understood differently by the public, art would gain in public esteem and have wider appeal. His criticism of existing theories is that they \\"spiritualize\\" art and sever its connection with everyday experience. Glorifying art and setting it on a pedestal separates it from community life. Such theories actually do harm by preventing people from realizing the artistic value of their daily activities and the popular arts (movies, jazz, newspaper accounts of sensational exploits) that they most enjoy, and drives away the aesthetic perceptions which are a necessary ingredient of happiness. Art has aesthetic standing only as it becomes an experience for human beings. Art intensifies the sense of immediate living, and accentuates what is valuable in enjoyment. Art begins with happy absorption in activity. Anyone who does his work with care, such as artists, scientists, mechanics, craftsmen, etc., are artistically engaged. The aesthetic experience involves the passing from disturbance to harmony and is one of man's most intense and satisfying experiences. Art cannot be relegated to museums. There are historic reasons for the compartmentalization of art into museums and galleries. Capitalism, nationalism and imperialism have all played a major role. The Live Creature and Ethereal Things The title of the chapter is taken from John Keats who once wrote, in a letter to Benjamin Robert Haydon, In Dewey, this statement can be taken several ways: the term 'ethereal' is used in reference to the theorists of idealist aesthetics and other schools that have equated art with elements inaccessible to sense and common experience because of their perceived transcendent, spiritual qualities. This serves as a further condemnation of aesthetic theory that unjustly elevates art too far above the pragmatic, experiential roots that it is drawn from. Another interpretation of the phrase could be that the 'earth and its contents' being, presumably, the ingredients to form 'ethereal things' further expounds the idea of Dewey's pragmatist aesthetics. In other words, the 'earth and its contents' could refer to 'human experience' being used to create art, (the 'ethereal things') which, though derived from the earth and experience, still contains a godly, creative quality not inherent in original creation. Addressing the intrusion of the supernatural into art, mythology, and religious ceremony, Dewey defends the need for the esoteric in addition to pure rationalism. Furthermore, the human imagination is seen by Dewey to be a powerful synthesizing tool to express experience with the environment. Essentially, rationality alone can neither suffice to understand life completely or ensure an enriched existence. Dewey writes that religious behaviors and rituals were Art and (aesthetic) mythology, according to Dewey, is an attempt to find light in a great darkness. Art appeals directly to sense and the sensuous imagination, and many aesthetic and religious experiences occur as the result of energy and material used to expand and intensify the experience of life. Returning to Keats, Dewey closes the chapter by making reference to another of Keats's passages, Concerning the passage, Dewey addresses the doctrine of divine revelation and the role of the imagination in experience and art. Having an Experience John Dewey distinguishes between experience in general and \\"an\\" experience. Experience occurs continually, as people are always involved in the process of living, but it is often interrupted and inchoate, with conflict and resistance. Much of the time people are not concerned with the connection of events but instead there is a loose succession, and this is non-aesthetic. Experience, however, is not an experience. An experience occurs when a work is finished in a satisfactory way, a problem solved, a game is played through, a conversation is rounded out, and fulfillment and consummation conclude the experience. In an experience, every successive part flows freely. An experience has a unity and episodes fuse into a unity, as in a work of art. The experience may have been something of great or just slight importance. Such an experience has its own individualizing quality. An experience is individual and singular; each has its own beginning and end, its own plot, and its own singular quality that pervades the entire experience. The final import is intellectual, but the occurrence is emotional as well. Aesthetic experience cannot be sharply marked off from other experiences, but in an aesthetic experience, structure may be immediately felt and recognized, there is completeness and unity and necessarily emotion. Emotion is the moving and cementing force. There is no one word to combine \\"artistic\\" and \\"aesthetic,\\" unfortunately, but \\"artistic\\" refers to the production, the doing and making, and \\"aesthetic\\" to appreciating, perceiving, and enjoying. For a work to be art, it must also be aesthetic. The work of the artist is to build an experience that will be experienced aesthetically. The Act of Expression Artistic expression is not \\"spontaneous.\\" The mere spewing forth of emotion is not artistic expression. Art requires long periods of activity and reflection, and comes only to those absorbed in observing experience. An artist's work requires reflection on past experience and a sifting of emotions and meanings from that prior experience. For an activity to be converted into an artistic expression, there must be excitement, turmoil and an urge from within to go outward. Art is expressive when there is complete absorption in the subject and a unison of present and past experience is achieved. There are values and meanings best expressed by certain visible or audible material. Appetites know themselves better when artistically transfigured. Artistic expression clarifies turbulent emotions. The process is essentially the same in scientists and philosophers as well as those conventionally defined as artists. Aesthetic quality will adhere to all modes of production in a well- ordered society. The Expressive Object The fifth chapter Dewey turns to the expressive object. He believes that the object should not be seen in isolation from the process that produced it, nor from the individuality of vision from which it came. Theories which simply focus on the expressive object dwell on how the object represents other objects and ignore the individual contribution of the artist. Conversely, theories that simply focus on the act of expressing tend to see expression merely in terms of personal discharge. Works of art use materials that come from a public world, and they awaken new perceptions of the meanings of that world, connecting the universal and the individual organically. The work of art is representative, not in the sense of literal reproduction, which would exclude the personal, but in that it tells people about the nature of their experience. Dewey observes that some who have denied art meaning have done so on the assumption that art does not have connection with outside content. He agrees that art has a unique quality, but argues that this is based on its concentrating meaning found in the world. For Dewey, the actual Tintern Abbey expresses itself in Wordsworth's poem about it and a city expresses itself in its celebrations. In this, he is quite different from those theorists who believe that art expresses the inner emotions of the artist. The difference between art and science is that art expresses meanings, whereas science states them. A statement gives directions for obtaining an experience, but does not supply an experience. That water is tells how to obtain or test for water. If science expressed the inner nature of things it would be in competition with art, but it does not. Aesthetic art, by contrast to science, constitutes an experience. A poem operates in the dimension of direct experience, not of description or propositional logic. The expressiveness of a painting is the painting itself. The meaning is there beyond the painter's private experience or that of the viewer. A painting by Van Gogh of a bridge is not representative of a bridge or even of Van Gogh's emotion. Rather, by means of pictorial presentation, Van Gogh presents the viewer with a new object in which emotion and external scene are fused. He selects material with a view to expression, and the picture is expressive to the degree that he succeeds. Dewey notes that formalist art critic Roger Fry spoke of relations of lines and colors coming to be full of passionate meaning within the artist. For Fry the object as such tends to disappear in the whole of vision. Dewey agrees with the first point and with the idea that creative representation is not of natural items as they literally happen. He adds however that the painter approaches the scene with emotion-laden background experiences. The lines and colors of the painter's work crystallize into a specific harmony or rhythm which is a function also of the scene in its interaction with the beholder. This passion in developing a new form is the aesthetic emotion. The prior emotion is not forgotten but fused with the emotion belonging to the new vision. Dewey, then, opposes the idea that the meanings of the lines and colors in a painting would completely replace other meanings attached to the scene. He also rejects the notion that the work of art only expresses something exclusive to art. The theory that subject-matter is irrelevant to art commits its advocates to seeing art as esoteric. To distinguish between aesthetic values of ordinary experience (connected with subject-matter) and aesthetic values of art, as Fry wished, is impossible. There would be nothing for the artist to be passionate about if she approached the subject matter without interests and attitudes. The artist first brings meaning and value from earlier experience to her observation giving the object its expressiveness. The result is a completely new object of a completely new experience. For Dewey, an artwork clarifies and purifies confused meaning of prior experience. By contrast, a non-art drawing that simply suggests emotions through arrangements of lines and colors is similar to a signboard that indicates but does not contain meaning: it is only enjoyed because of what they remind people of. Also, whereas a statement or a diagram points to many things of the same kind, an expressive object is individualized, for example in expressing a particular depression. Substance and Form Consistent with his non-dualistic thinking, Dewey does not draw a sharp distinction between substance and form. He states that ‚Äúthere can be no distinction drawn, save in reflection, between form and substance.‚Äù For Dewey, substance is different from subject. One could say that Keats‚Äô Ode to a Nightingale has a nightingale for a subject, but for Dewey the substance of the poem is the poem. Substance represents the culmination of the artist‚Äôs creative efforts. Form for Dewey is the quality of having form. Having form allows the substance to be evoked in such a way that ‚Äúit can enter into the experiences of others and enable them to have more intense and more fully rounded out experiences of their own.‚Äù This process exemplifies Dewey‚Äôs triadic relationship between artist, art object, and creative viewer. Natural History of Form In this chapter, Dewey states that the ‚Äúformal conditions of artistic form‚Äù are ‚Äúrooted deep in the world itself.‚Äù The interaction of the living organism with its environment is the source of all forms of resistance, tension, furtherance, balance ‚Äì that is, those elements essential for aesthetic experience and which, themselves, constitute form. These elements of interaction are subsumed in one broad term for Dewey, rhythm. He states: ‚ÄúThere is rhythm in nature before poetry, painting, architecture and music exist.‚Äù Consequently, it makes sense for someone to see aesthetically according to Dewey. For example, the analogy of people seeing a building from a ferry. In this case, the person who sees aesthetically, is the one who is able to see like the artist, the one who recognizes the relations of the parts to the whole, etc. These larger rhythms of nature include the cycles of day and night, the seasons, the reproduction of plants and animals, as well as the development of human craft necessary for living with these changes in nature. This gives rise to the development of the rituals for planting, harvest, and even war. These rhythms of change and repetition have seated themselves deep in human subconsciousness. Via this path from nature, people find the essential rhythms of all the arts. Dewey writes: ‚ÄúUnderneath the rhythm of every art and of every work of art there lies, as a substratum in the depths of the subconsciousness, the basic pattern of the relations of the live creature to his environment.‚Äù The aesthetic deployment of these rhythms constitutes artistic form. Organization of Energies Energy pervades the work of art, and the more that energy is clarified, intensified, and concentrated, the more compelling the work of art should be. Dewey gives the example of young children intending to act a play. ‚ÄúThey gesticulate, tumble and roll, each pretty much on his own account, with little reference to what others are doing.‚Äù This is contrasted with the ‚Äúwell-constructed and well- executed‚Äù play. However, it does not necessarily follow that the latter play will be better than the former. This is merely an extreme case of contrasting aesthetic values based on different organizations of energy. The organization of energy manifests itself in patterns or intervals, now more now less. This patterning is related to Dewey‚Äôs earlier ideas on rhythm. He writes that instances of energy are ‚Äúpiecemeal, one replacing another‚Ä¶And thus we are brought again to rhythm.‚Äù However, the organization of energies is not the same as rhythm. The organization of energy is important as ‚Äúthe common element in all the arts‚Äù for ‚Äúproducing a result.‚Äù Artistic skill exemplifies skillful organization of energy. An over-emphasis of a single source of energy (at the expense of others sources of energy) in a work of art shows poor organization of energy. At the end of the chapter, Dewey states that art is, in fact, ‚Äúonly definable as organization of energies.‚Äù The power of art to ‚Äúmove and stir, to calm and tranquilize‚Äù is intelligible only when ‚Äúthe fact of energy‚Äù is made central to an understanding of art. The qualities of order and balance in works of art follow from the selection of significant energy. Great art, therefore, finds and deploys ideal energy. The Common Substance of the Arts In this chapter Dewey examines several qualities that are common to all works of art. Early in the chapter, Dewey discusses the feeling of a ‚Äútotal seizure‚Äù, a sense of ‚Äúan inclusive whole not yet articulated‚Äù that one feels immediately in the experiencing of a work of art. This sense of wholeness, of all the parts of the work coalescing, can only be intuited. Parts of the work of art may be discriminated, but their sense of coalescence is a quality of intuition. Without this ‚Äúintuited enveloping quality, parts are external to one another and mechanically related.‚Äù This sense of wholeness conveyed by the work of art distinguishes the work from the background in which it sits. Evidence of this idea of the artwork standing apart from its background is ‚Äúour constant sense of things as belonging or not belonging, of relevancy, a sense which is immediate.‚Äù Yet the background represents the ‚Äúunlimited envelope‚Äù of the world people live in, and the work of art, though seen as a discrete thing, is intimately connected with the larger background. People intuit this connection, and in this process there is something mystical. ‚ÄúAn experience becomes mystical in the degree which the sense, the feeling, of the unlimited envelope becomes intense ‚Äì as it may do in the experience of an art object.‚Äù Though this mystical quality may not be a common substance of all art objects, the sense of wholeness within the object and its relation to a background are. A further common substance to all works of art is related to the idea of means and ends. In aesthetic works and aesthetic experience, means and ends coalesce. Means are ends in the aesthetic. The non- aesthetic has a clear separation of means and ends: means are merely means, mechanical steps used solely to achieve the desired end. Dewey uses the idea of ‚Äújourneying‚Äù as an example. Non-aesthetic journeying is undertaken merely to arrive at the destination; any steps to shorten the trip are gladly taken. Aesthetic journeying is undertaken for ‚Äúthe delight of moving about and seeing what we see.‚Äù Extending non-aesthetic experience may lead to frustration and impatience, whereas drawing out aesthetic experience may increase a feeling of pleasure. Every artwork and art discipline has a ‚Äúspecial medium‚Äù that it exploits. In doing so, the different disciplines achieve the sense of wholeness in a given work, and the coalescing of ends and means in qualitatively different ways. ‚ÄúMedia are different in the different arts. But possession of a medium belongs to them all. Otherwise they would not be expressive, nor without the common substance could they possess form.‚Äù Dewey discusses another matter that is common to the substance of all works of art: space and time. Both space and time have qualities of room, extent, and position. For the concept of space, he identifies these qualities as spaciousness, spatiality, and spacing. And for the concept of time: transition, endurance, and date. Dewey devotes most of the remainder of the chapter to a discussion of these qualities in different art works and disciplines. In the final paragraphs, Dewey summarizes the chapter. He claims that there must be common substance in the arts ‚Äúbecause there are general conditions without which an experience is not possible.‚Äù Ultimately, then, it is the person experiencing the artwork who must distinguish and appreciate these common qualities, for ‚Äúthe intelligibility of a work of art depends upon the presence to the meaning that renders individuality of parts and their relationship in the whole directly present to the eye and ear trained in perception.‚Äù The Varied Substance of the Arts The Human Contribution The Challenge to Philosophy Criticism and Perception Art and Civilization  See also  *List of publications by John Dewey  Notes  1934 documents Aesthetics literature Works by John Dewey ","title":"Art as Experience"},{"id":"14395424","text":"The Recreation Grounds, opened in 1885, were the first home of St Johnstone F.C., a football club based in Perth, Scotland. It met their requirements for almost forty years, until the club moved to the other side of the town, opening Muirton Park in 1924. History The St Johnstone football club was formed by members of the town's cricket club, who were seeking a suitable sport to occupy them during the months when cricket was not in season. Well- known local curler George Valentine was the football club's first President. The twenty members of the newly formed football club contributed one Scottish pound each to lease suitable land at Craigie Haugh, near the South Inch park and across from where Perth Prison stands today.Official club website history section The land, leased from Sir Robert Moncrieffe, became known as the Recreation Grounds. The football ground was typical of its era but very basic by today's standard. A small grandstand and pavilion (described as \\"dilapidated\\" in the minutes of a 1924 meeting) was the only shelter for spectators; the rest of the crowd watched matches while standing on a grassy banking around the remainder of the pitch. The grandstand had not been built new in 1885 - it had previously housed spectators watching horse racing on the North Inch. The Recreation Grounds were officially opened on 15 August 1885;St. Johnstone origins - Perth and Kinross Council official website however, somewhat unusually, the home club didn't participate in the match. The now-defunct Our Boys, from the city of Dundee down the River Tay, were beaten 6-0 by Queen's Park from Glasgow. Gate receipts were ¬£50. It was at the Recreation Grounds that St Johnstone played its first match in the Scottish Football League. On Saturday, 19 August 1911, Arthurlie from East Renfrewshire were defeated 4-1 in a Division Two match. Ticket sales netted a profit of ¬£40. The club was also involved in some high-scoring matches in the early years of its existence. They achieved their record victory of 15-0 twice during their first decade. The club also suffered all of its record defeats at the Recreation Grounds. At a meeting in February 1924, during which shareholders met to discuss the club's options for a new football ground, the following is recorded in the minutes: > \\"Regarding the old or present site. Not being conversant with the history of > the club, nor of the reasons why such a situation was selected, it is > unnecessary for me to deal, beyond expressing some surprise that cramped > area with unprepossing surroundings along with an extremely bad access - > specially for vehicles should have been laid out as a football field by an > outstanding club.\\" At the end of the meeting, it was agreed unanimously to choose the Muirton Park site for the club's future. The club moved to its current location, McDiarmid Park, after selling the Muirton Park site to the Asda supermarket chain in the late 1980s. Facts and figures *Highest attendance: 12,000 (approx.) v.

Bronze statue of a Lar Title and Origins In his prologue to the spectators the author first says Aululariam hodie sumus acturi (‚ÄòWe are going to perform the Aulularia today‚Äô),Ranstrand p. 5, 1. then offers a choice of title: Querolus an Aulularia haec dicatur fabula, vestrum hinc iudicium, vestra erit sententia (‚ÄòWhether this play is called Querolus or Aulularia will be your judgement, your decision‚Äô).Ranstrand p. 5, 12-13. The archetype of the surviving manuscripts seem to have had the title Aulularia, along with a false attribution to Plautus, who had also written an Aulularia. Modern scholars generally use the title Querolus to avoid confusion with Plautus‚Äô Aulularia. Date and place of composition are uncertain.For discussion, see Cavallin (1951), 137-143; K√ºppers (1979). Mention of lawlessness ad Ligerem (‚Äòby the Loire‚Äô)Ranstrand p. 17, 13. suggests a Gallic origin and perhaps an early fifth-century date, if it refers to a Bagaudae uprising. The work is addressed and dedicated to a certain Rutilius (perhaps Rutilius Namatianus), a vir illustris of the highest senatorial rank and holder of imperial appointments as governor of Tuscany, vicar of Britain, Imperial Treasurer (comes sacrarum largitionum), Senior Legal Counsel (quaestor) to the emperor, and urban prefect of Rome in the years up to 414. He was of higher social standing than the author.Ranstrand p. 3, 1 Rutili venerande, p. 4, 18 vir illustris (vir is a conjectural supplement here, but the identification of Rutilius as a vir illustris does not depend on it). Metre and Language Although the text is printed as prose, the author was clearly trying to give the effect of the metres of Plautus.Cavallin (1951), 143-6. Sentences and phrases regularly end with the line endings of a trochaic septenarius or iambic senarius; and there is a tendency to trochaic sequences at the start of the next unit. In the middle however the metrical form of a Plautine verse is only occasionally preserved. The language used also has many reminiscences of early Latin comedy, both occasional archaisms and imitations or borrowings of whole phrases.Jacquemard-Le Saos (1994) conveniently annotates larger reminiscences where they occur. Subject Matter Plot The plot concerns the attempt by a pretended magician, Mandrogerus, to cheat the poor and grumpy Querolus of a treasure hidden in his house. Querolus‚Äô father Euclio, dying abroad, had confided the location of the treasure to Mandrogerus. After Euclio‚Äôs death Mandrogerus was supposed to show Querolus the treasure and receive a half share as reward. Instead he tricks Querolus into allowing him to remove his ‚Äòbad fortune‚Äô from his house ‚Äì the pot with the gold within it. On inspection, the pot seems to be a funerary urn, with only ashes inside it. Mandrogerus throws the pot back into Querolus‚Äô house. It breaks and reveals the gold hidden within. When Mandrogerus learns of the gold, he returns and attempts to claim his share by his agreement with Euclio; but his own account leaves him with a choice of a charge of theft or sacrilege. Finally Querolus takes pity on him and allows him to remain as his dependent. Dramatic technique It seems unlikely that the author of the work was expecting it to be performed on stage in its original context. More probably it may have been read out as an entertainment at a banquet.Ranstrand p. 3, 13-4 \\"nos fabellis atque mensis hunc librum (or more probably libellum) scripsimus\\" (\\"We wrote this book for talk and feasts\\"); p. 5, 7 \\"materia vosmet reficiet, si fatigat lectio\\" (\\"the material will revive you, if the reading tires you\\"). But it is clear that the play is written to be performable within the conventions of ancient drama; and many aspects of dramatic technique, such as the preparation and motivation of entrances and exits, are carefully observed.K√ºppers (1989), 88, with n. 25; Le Saos (1994), xxviii. Many scenes are extended far beyond the demands of the plot for their own interest. The play opens with an extended discussion between Querolus and the household Lar, who, in the style of popular philosophy, compels Querolus to admit that his dissatisfaction with life is unjustified and that there is nothing that he can reasonably desire. Querolus‚Äô slave, Pantomalus, has a long monologue complaining of his unreasonable master, which rather reveals his own idleness and dishonesty. Mandrogerus advises Querolus about the various occult powers from which one can seek aid, a scene mocking superstitious beliefs, but also, perhaps, covertly alluding to corrupt civil servants, whose favour must be sought with bribes. Models There are several similarities to Plautus‚Äô Aulularia in the play: the grumpy character of Querolus; a pot of gold; the appearance of the Lar of his house and his role in leading Querolus to discover the gold; a theft. In addition the grumpy house owner in Plautus is called Euclio, the name of Querolus‚Äô father; some see the work as a kind of sequel to Plautus‚Äô play.K√ºppers (1989), 100-1. Reception and Modern Editions The play had some success in the Middle Ages and provided Vitalis of Blois in the twelfth century with the model for his own Aulularia.Jacquemard-Le Saos (1994), xxxviii-xxxix. Since the renaissance, however, it has been largely neglected. One exception is the satirical novelist Thomas Love Peacock, who devoted an essay to it in his Horae Dramaticae of 1852.Fraser‚Äôs Magazine 45, 1852, 291-302, reprinted in The Works of Thomas Love Peacock vol. X (London: Constable, 1926), 4-38. The first printed edition is that of P. Daniel (Paris 1564).Jacquemard-Le Saos (1994), lxvii. There is no fully satisfactory modern critical edition: Ranstrand (1951) is generally cited, but fails to make use of an important witness, the seventeenth century copy of a lost manuscript from Reims.M.D. Reeve, ‚ÄòTricipitinus‚Äôs Son‚Äô, Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik 22, 1976, 21-31. The ending of the work is missing (although evidently the plot is complete and very little text has been lost). In the manuscripts, it is followed without a break by the (also fragmentary) Lex convivalis, which some regard as a part of the play. References *Editions **Ranstrand, G.

Its first president was Gregor Golobiƒç, former Secretary General of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia and former close advisor to the late Janez Drnov≈°ek, who had previously abandoned active political involvement due to disagreements with his party. Until October 2011, the party was called Zares - New Politics (Zares - nova politika), when the party adopted its current title.http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/golobic-zares-je-nepogresljiv-za- delovanje-parlamenta-ce-naj-bo-to- legitimno/268477http://delo.si/novice/politika/v-zares-spremenili-ime-a- ohranili-predsednika.html The party supported a social progressive and economically social-liberal agenda, strongly supported the European Union and was a staunch opponent of the former Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jan≈°a. Since 17 November 2007, Zares has been an observer member of the Liberal International, and was also a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). History Zares was founded in 2007 as the result of a split within the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia, when 6 MPs of the National Assembly, led by former Minister of Economy Matej Lahovnik, left their original party and founded a new parliamentary group. In the 2007 presidential election, the party supported Independent presidential candidate Danilo T√ºrk, who was elected President of Slovenia. The party's first election, Zares gathered 9.4% of the vote, gaining 9 parliamentary seats and became the third strongest party in Slovenia. Before the election the party allied itself with the Social Democrats and the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia in an unofficial coalition. From November 2008 till October 2011, Zares was part of the centre- left government led by Social Democrats party president Borut Pahor. At the 2011 Slovenian parliamentary election on 4 December 2011, Zares won 0.65% of the vote, thus not reaching the parliamentary threshold of 4%.

He was accused of misleading the media about his investment into that company during the campaign for the 2008 parliamentary election. According to allegations, the company had some 21 million euro of unsecured loans at the state-owned Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB). When the media examined the loans, it came out that Golobiƒç owns 10% of Ultra SUM, a Netherlands-based company which owns 70% of Ultra company. This was a fact that he had withheld from the public during the 2008 general election campaign. Golobiƒç publicly apologized for having misled the public, but refused to resign as the minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology.Slovenia Times article - July edition, page 6 - retrieved 2009-07-14 The Ultra Scandal was also one of the reasons for the decision of Matej Lahovnik, one of the co-founders of the party Zares, to leave the party in July 2010.

It runs through the suburbs of St. Andrew's, Bishopston and Horfield and is a part of the A38, a former coaching route north of Bristol to Filton and the M5 Motorway. The street is a focal point for local businesses, and is promoted by Bristol City Council as a centre of independent trade. The Bristol North Baths on Gloucester Road were popular for most of the 20th century, and the location was used in filming for several television shows. Numerous shops and bars have achieved popularity in the local press for their unique contribution to Bristol. Graffiti and stencil art is popular and encouraged by some business in the area. Geography The road is around long. It starts at the junction with Cheltenham Road, Zetland Road and Elton Road. Cheltenham Road is spanned by a railway viaduct (known locally as \\"the Arches\\") carrying the Severn Beach Line south of this junction. The first property on Gloucester Road (1‚Äì3) is the Maplin electronics shop (due to close in 2018) where the, now culverted, Cutler's Mills Brook joins the Horfield Brook. The difference between the two roads is further emphasised by the fact that Gloucester Road has the postal code of BS7 whilst Cheltenham Road is BS6. The road heads northeast through the suburbs of St. Andrew's, Bishopston and Horfield, ending at the edge of the 19th century Bristol County Borough by the site of Horfield Barracks. The road ahead through the suburbs is Filton Road, then Gloucester Road North towards the site of Filton Airport and the M5. The road is part of the A38, a cross- country route across England, though in this part of Bristol it is not a major through route. It is part of the Cotham, Redland and Gloucester Road Conservation Area, designated by Bristol City Council to conserve the local architecture and open space. Cycling and motorist groups have clashed about facilities on Gloucester Road; the former want a better provision of cycling lanes, while the latter would like better parking facilities. The situation has increased in the 2010s following Bristol becoming the first Cycling City in 2008 and encouraging more cycling. History Both the Bristol Flyer and Bristol North Baths on Gloucester Road were used for location filming in Only Fools and Horses. The road has been part of the coaching route from Bristol to Gloucester since the Middle Ages, as the name suggests, though the historic route south of it took a different route to the city centre via Cotham Road and Horfield Road, while traffic today goes via Cheltenham Road and Stokes Croft. It had become built-up along its length around 1888. Shops and traders settled on the road in the late 19th century. At the turn of the 20th, there were a high concentration of butchers and grocers, as was typical for the time, but these were gradually replaced by pubs, cafes and charity shops. The street was home to Rooted Records, the central location of the Bristol dubstep scene until closure in 2010. The Bristol North Baths were based on Gloucester Road, and the building is Grade II listed. Opening in 1915, they once included an annex for \\"slipper baths\\" that catered for individual bathing, as opposed to swimming in a group. The annex was demolished and became a car park in 2002, while the main baths closed in 2005. The building is awaiting redevelopment into flats. Along with the Bristol Flyer at No. 96 next door, the baths were used for location shots in the television sitcoms Only Fools and Horses and The Young Ones. Although Bristol City Council has invested ¬£3m in redeveloping the North Baths, progress has continually stalled, as hidden structural problems have been uncovered. In 2016, the council reported an extra ¬£1.5 million would be required to complete the project. Shopping The Hobgoblin pub, Gloucester Road Gloucester Road is well known for independent shops. In 2012, its only chain store was a branch of Somerfield. It has survived due to the concentration of middle class housing on either side of the road, whose occupiers prefer local goods. A Bristol Post report suggested \\"you can buy anything you could ever need\\" on Gloucester Road, and that it captured the independent spirit of the local community well. A Barratt Homes report has described Gloucester Road as having the longest row of independent shops in Europe. The Grape & Grind, an off licence at No. 101, was established in 2010, and includes an enomatic wine dispenser. Reclaimers Reclamation at No. 307, specialises in furniture recycled from other products, such as kitchen worktop made from the slate off a snooker table. Along with the craft shop Fig at No. 206, these shops were featured as part of the ten best independent shops in Bristol in a report by The Guardian. Crawford's Newsagents, at No. 200, has been trading since the Victorian era. The Drapers Arms, a pub, is at No. 447. It is currently being converted into a micropub with locally brewed beer and a lack of fruit machines and juke boxes. Culture Because Gloucester Road is popular with artists, creative works are encouraged by local businesses. The Golden Lion pub permits graffiti artists to draw on their walls, provided their artwork includes a lion. In 2014, a graffiti stencil of Cary Grant, who grew up in the local area, was drawn above Room 212 on Gloucester Road. Though Banksy's artwork features in many locations around Bristol, there is none on Gloucester Road; the nearest being \\"The Mild Mild West\\" further south on the A38 at Stokes Croft. An annual street party is held every Christmas on Gloucester Road. During the event, shops are encouraged to open late, and additional food and drink stalls are available. In 2014, Bristol City Council spent over ¬£23,000 on new Christmas lights on order to promote the party and related events. Public transport Ten bus routes operate on Gloucester Road; the 3A, 3B and 3X operated by Stagecoach West, and the 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, T2 and Severn Express operated by First West of England. The nearest railway station is Montpelier railway station on the Severn Beach Line. Future plans Studies produced by the West of England Combined Authority have deduced that journeys by bus along Gloucester Road are slow and unreliable as a result of slow-moving traffic along the route, which limits the potential to achieve modal shift from the car as public transport is not an attractive option for many journeys. Highway constraints on the road limit the ability to increase public transport capacity with additional bus services. Therefore, a fully segregated rapid transit route, potentially underground, is desired to address transport needs on the corridor.

In the game, the player does not directly control the avatar; instead, the player helps to guide the avatar via a system of cameras and remotely controlled equipment as a person who is sitting in front of a computer. The game is similar to the modern game Republique Gameplay With the use of a sophisticated security system the player helps the main character, Lea Nichols by telling her where to go, by turning lights on and off, opening doors, entering codes, controlling helper robots, and reading the torrent of files, email, and codes you are given. Not all the e-mail contain helpful information, neither are all the cameras useful, some having fallen objects obscure the view or being otherwise non-functional. The game keeps a log of real world play time with Lea noting how many days long you've kept her waiting since last playing. Plot The setting is a derelict ship stranded on a beach in the middle of the ocean. The player, an anonymous person, is mysteriously locked in the operations room with doctor Lea Nichols, the only survivor of the said ship. The player first finds Lea Nichols through the camera lens when she wakes up from her room. After a brief introduction of herself, she is reluctant to trust the player with valuable information (such as the login details to her computer account). However, since the player is the only person still alive beside her, she has to rely on them for her survival. During exploration with Nichols on the ship, she finds the remains of her old colleagues and occasionally, recollects some memory fragments of an experiment subject called \\"112\\". Development and release Outside of Europe, the game was released in February 2008 by The Adventure Company. In North America, Lea's appearance on the box art was changed considerably, but her in-game appearance was unaltered.French cover art vs. North American cover art Reception EXperience112 was met with mixed or average reviews. GamingShogun called the game a \\"very rewarding and challenging adventure/puzzle game which manages to create a hodgepodge of voyeurism, lateral thinking, and atmosphere that will surely give you the willies if played by yourself in a dark room\\".

The stone is a soft limestone known for its deep burnt-orange colour. It is an inferior oolite of the Garantiana Beds and dates to the Middle Jurassic. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building.  House  Hadspen House is said to have begun as a farmhouse, purchased by the London-lawyer William Player in 1687 on the Hadspen estate,[1 ] Player 'built the forefront of a gentleman's house in Byfleet Close, a barn two stables and ox house.' Player's expansion continued for 10‚Äì12 years. It included building walls around a court, adding a service wing, 'a stall for 24 cattle, a farm baliff's house, a brewhouse' and modern plumbing, with a leaded-pipe water supply. Player also begins the garden, planting extensively on both sides of the house and trees, behind, south and north of the house, that included beeches, elms, poplars, ashes and cherries. Hadspen is noted as Hatch-been on John Ward‚Äôs map around 1650. Yet Hadspen House and Hadspen are located on maps as early as 1736, as a gentleman's seat on the eastern edge of Castle Cary Manor. By 1822, Hadspen House and Hadspen are shown as a significant landed estate on C. & J. Greenwood's 1820-21 survey, the Nobility Clergy and Gentry of Somersetshire. Player sold Hadspen House to Vickris Dickinson 60 years later, in 1747. Twenty years later, in 1767 Vickris Dickinson sold it to Charles Medows and then to John Ford. Medows began its expansion and improvement in 1767, which Ford continued. In 1785 Henry Hobhouse II, Esquire a lawyer and head of the Bristol Bar purchased Hadspen and Hadspen House, significantly expanding the Hobhouse land ownership in Somersetshire and establishing the Hobhouse family seat. 'The Hobhouses were Bristol merchants who had recently established themselves as country gentlemen.' Henry Hobhouse I and his brother Isaac made their fortune as Bristol merchants in the slave, sugar and tobacco trades between Bristol, Africa, the West Indies and Virginia in the early- and mid-18th century. At the time of purchase in 1785 the Hadspen estate comprised 717 acres. Hadspen House was ‚Äòa modern stone-built House of Six rooms on a floor with marble chimney-pieces, stabling for 20 horses, a good garden and extensive woodland.' In 1786 and 1786 Henry Hobhouse II continued to expand the house and the furnishings. His alterations in 1786-87 include 'raising the ceilings of the front rooms, adding a new dining room to the north-east, three reception rooms, the drawing and library rooms and reroofing the house in grey Welsh slate. His alterations created Hadspen House into an the grandeur of the 18th century Georgian manor house for which it is known today. Major alterations to the rear were made by his heir, the Right Honorable Henry Hobhouse, in 1828. His son Henry, a land owner again made major alterations to the rear in 1886, as did his son Sir Arthur Lawrence, liberal politician and architect of national parks of England and Wales, in 1909. Within the original grounds are a coachhouse, cottage, granary, southwest lodge, stables summerhouse and a number of modern follies. The clock house barn was converted into a five- bedroom dwelling in 2000.  Landscape garden  In the early 18th century William Player created gardens a la fran√ßaise with geometric plantings with courts, fountains and three axes in the 300-acres surrounding the house. At the height of the landscape garden movement Henry Hobhouse Esquire had Player‚Äôs strict geometry cut with picturesque vistas and rolling hills. In the 1960s Penelope Hobhouse transformed the walled parabola vegetable garden, planting within and around it a 20th century Arts and Crafts garden. It opened to visitors in 1970 and is published in Penelope Hobhouse‚Äôs 1976 publication The Country Gardener. In 1987 the garden was leased to Canadian gardeners and authors Nori and Sandra Pope. In 2007 Niall Hobhouse sponsored a competition for its redesign.

It was founded in the 17th century when non-conformist churches were undergoing persecution in England, although Castle Hill itself escaped much persecution due to the protection offered by Lord Brooke of Warwick Castle. Due to the threat of persecution the church at first met in private houses. In 1655 the Midland Baptist Association (now termed the Heart of England Baptist Association) was founded at a meeting hosted by Castle Hill and attended by six other Baptist churches in the Midlands. In 1685 the church began meeting at its current site. It had been given a garden plot to act as a cemetery due to restrictions on non-Anglican burials in the graveyards of parish churches. For the next 15 years the church continued to meet in a house on the plot. However in 1700 the first purpose- built church building was constructed on the site. Other key developments of this period in the church's history include earliest date from which continuous church records exist (1697) and the introduction of hymn singing to the church around 1710. The first church building only lasted some 40 years and shortly afterwards John Cohen Rylands became the minister of the church. Ryland's son was a co-founder of the Baptist Missionary Society. During the 18th century the membership of the church fluctuated between 30 and 100. Church membership was only open to those who were baptised as adults, and this did not change until 1930. At the end of the 18th century the church began a Sunday school. This did not stop the early years of the 19th century being hard ones. By 1820 the church was near closure and only the efforts of Lawrence Tatham, a deacon of the church, saved it. In the early 1830s the extension of the vote to a much larger section of the population by the Reform Acts caused the church to split. However by a decade later the congregation had grown so much that an extension to the church building was necessary. Even this extension proved inadequate to the growing size of the church and in 1866 a much larger Gothic revival style church was built to replace the 1740s structure. That building was to serve the church for the next 120 years and it covered virtually the whole site, including the former graveyard. The 250th anniversary of the Midland Baptist Association in 1905 saw a refurbishment of the interior of the building and the fitting of a pipe organ. By the mid-20th century the condition of the 1866 church building was causing serious concern. Woodworm had ravaged parts of the structure and dry rot was becoming a constant problem. The church membership had again shrunk and there was a severe danger of a re-run of the problems of 1820. The question of what to do about the old building was a seemingly insolvable problem due to the lack of monetary resources of the church. In the end a new church building was erected, but the process of realising that project was a long one which began in 1970. In that year the pub which was then next door to the church came on the market. Through various trials, including the church secretary lending the church his pension fund, the pub and its accompanying car park were purchased. The purchase taxed the funds of the church to their utmost, limiting options until the loan was paid off. Further new premises were bought in 1976 when the church hall of the parish church of St Nicholas came on the market. The former pub saw use as general purpose church rooms, the church hall saw use for youth work and the car park was immensely helpful in the congested centre of Warwick. However the condition of the 1866 building was still deteriorating. By 1986 its condition had deteriorated so much that it was no longer safe to use for services. Sunday services were moved to the church hall in Gerard Street purchased a decade earlier. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw progress begin in earnest on the new building. In 1993 Warwick Town Council, backed by English Heritage, stated that the 1866 building must be preserved, given its historic nature. The planning application for the new building was rejected. After more struggles, including with the Royal Fine Art Commission, a revised planning application for the new building was approved in 1997. Funding for the estimated ¬£650,000 building cost was raised through a combination of congregation giving, charitable grants and bank loans. In April 1998 a final service was held in the old church before demolition. The new building was completed just under a year later. The church has undergone a renaissance in its new building and holds many events including two Sunday services, a playgroup, toddlers' group, prayer meeting and youth group. In 2019 it was decided that both the church and the church hall would undergo ¬£86,000 worth of re-furbishing in 2020. The current minister of the church is Reverend Peter Burns.

She studied painting under Hans Hofmann in New York, and her work was included in the Peggy Guggenheim collection. Life and work Admiral was born in Oregon, the daughter of Alice Caroline (n√©e Groman), a school teacher, and Donald Admiral, a grain broker. Admiral was raised as a Presbyterian but later became an atheist during her adulthood. Her father had English, French, and Dutch ancestry, and her mother was of German descent. In 1920, she was residing in Danville, Illinois, according to the census, with her parents and younger sister, Eleanor. By 1930, Virginia's parents had divorced and she was living with her mother and sister in Berkeley, California. While in Berkeley, her mother became a school teacher. Admiral studied at the Art Institute of Chicago under Hans Hofmann. In 1938, she worked on the Federal Art Project, in Oakland, California. While living in Berkeley, California, she had been part of an off-campus art, socialist, and literary scene. Having traveled together from California to Greenwich Village, New York, Admiral was an intimate friend of poet Robert Duncan throughout the 1940s as well as other artists and writers in the Village scene. Among them were Anais Nin and Kenneth Patchen. With Duncan, she produced an issue of the magazine Epitaph (later renamed The Experimental Review). Admiral, a painter, met Robert De Niro Sr., an aspiring artist, at one of Hans Hofmann's painting classes in Provincetown, Massachusetts. They first moved into an loft apartment on E. 14th Street, then later to an apartment on 8th Street, and then settled into one on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. They married in December 1942. In August 1943, Virginia gave birth to their son, award-winning actor and director Robert De Niro Jr.Robert De Niro - Biography, TalkTalk.co.uk For a time Admiral worked as a typist for Ana√Øs Nin. Both she and husband Robert wrote erotica briefly for Nin. She and Robert De Niro divorced in 1945, but remained close throughout their lives. When Robert Sr. was stricken with cancer, she took him in during his last years.http://www.theartstory.org/artist-de-niro-robert.htm Later, in New York, she wrote for True Crimes magazine. In 1942, Admiral exhibited her art in the Springs Salon for Young Artists at Peggy Guggenheim's \\"Art of This Century Gallery\\" in Manhattan. That same year she sold a painting to the Museum of Modern Art for $100. She was the first of her artist cohort to sell a painting to the Modern; Jackson Pollock had his first sale to the museum only two years later. She had a solo show at the same gallery in 1946 and her work was included in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection at the Venice Biennale in 1947. In later years, from 1973 to 1980, her art showed at Buecker and Harpsichords gallery. Admiral was active in political movements against the Vietnam War and for the rights of artists and the poor. In the 1960s she was instrumental in obtaining low-cost housing for artists working in the SoHo area of New York. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice.

However, he also composed instrumental music, two choral works, and four operas. Today, he is remembered almost exclusively for his 1881 song \\"Musica proibita\\" (\\"Forbidden Music\\"), still one of the most popular pieces of music in Italy. Gastaldon also wrote the lyrics for some of his songs, including \\"Musica proibita\\", under the pseudonym Flick-Flock. He was born in Turin and after a peripatetic childhood studied music there and in Florence. By 1900, he had settled permanently in Florence, where he died at the age of 77. In his later years he also worked as a voice teacher, music critic, and art dealer. Life and career Gastaldon was born in Turin on April 8, 1861 to Luigi Gastaldon and Luigia Grazioli. His father was an engineer from Lerino, a village near Torri di Quartesolo in the Veneto region of Italy. His mother was a Roman noblewoman who had married a wealthy land owner, Count Bernardo Genardini, at the age of 16. She met Luigi Gastaldon in 1854 when she was 23 and shortly thereafter abandoned her husband and four children to live with him. The family moved from one Italian city to another during Gastaldon's childhood and early youth while his father worked on a series of engineering projects. Part of his childhood was spent in San Vito Chietino in the Abruzzo region, where a street is now named for him and where his younger brother Guglielmo was born in 1864.Sbrocchi (April 18, 2003); Scaccetti (2002) p. 490. According to Scaccetti, no further mention of Gastaldon's younger brother has been found apart from his certificate of baptism. Cover of the 10th edition of \\"Musica proibita\\", Gastaldon's most enduring work Gastaldon studied music with the Turinese composer Antonio Creonti and with Torquato Meliani, an organist at the Florence Cathedral, as well as studying literature at the University of Florence.Sartori (1972) p. 94 He began composing songs at the age of 17, sometimes writing the lyrics himself under the pseudonym of \\"Flick- Flock\\".Scaccetti (2002) p. 494. In a 1903 profile of the minor Italian literary figure, Fausto Villa, published in La nuova fioritura to publicize his first novel, it was claimed that he had authored the words to \\"Musica probita\\". However, Scaccetti discounts this as does Rubboli (March 1989) pp. 70-71. Although it is not known for sure why Gastaldon chose \\"Flick-Flock\\", Italian musicologist Maria Scaccetti suggests that it probably derived from the popular ballet, Flick und Flock by Peter Ludwig Hertel, which had been performed at La Scala in 1861. Music from the ballet arranged as a military march became the official fanfare of the 12th Regiment of the Bersaglieri corps, which had been based in Turin.Scaccetti (2002) p. 494 Gastaldon was only 20 when the Florentine firm Venturini published his song \\"Musica proibita\\", which made his name as a composer and achieved an enduring popularity. Its success would also provide an entry to the most important salons in Italy, where many of his early songs were first performed. His musical fame preceded him when Gastaldon did his obligatory year of military service in 1883. He was assigned to be one of the \\"professors\\" of the 24th Infantry Regiment band.Scaccetti (2002) pp. 490-491; Sbrocchi (April 18, 2003) Libretto for Gastaldon's forgotten opera, Mala Pasqua!, 1890 When his military service ended, Gastaldon returned to Rome, where his parents were living at the time. Over the next four years he continued composing songs and short pieces of instrumental music and started work on his first opera, Fatma. However, in 1888, when the music publisher Sonzogno announced a competition for one-act operas, Gastaldon decided to enter with Mala Pasqua!, a setting of Giovanni Verga's popular short story (and later play), Cavalleria rusticana. Another young composer, Pietro Mascagni, entered the same contest with his opera Cavalleria rusticana, also based on Verga's story. Gastaldon withdrew his work early in the competition when he received an offer from Sonzogno's rival, Ricordi, to publish it and arrange a premiere at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. He expanded the opera to three acts, and Mala Pasqua! premiered on April 9, 1890 to modest success. Mascagni's opera eventually won the competition and premiered a month later on May 17 at the same theatre. Mascagni's work was an enormous success and completely eclipsed Gastaldon's. Nevertheless, he continued writing operas over the years, producing two one-act operas, Pater (1894) and Stellina (1905) and a three-act comic opera, Il Reuccio di Caprilana (1915). Like Mala Pasqua!, they premiered to moderate success but dropped almost immediately from the repertoire.Sbrocchi (April 18, 2003) After the premiere of Mala Pasqua! in 1890, Gastaldon lived in Orvieto for a time, and then settled in Florence, where he was to spend the rest of his life. There, in addition to composing, he taught singing and worked as a music critic for the Florentine paper Nuovo Giornale, as well as writing a column \\"Scattola Armonica\\" (\\"Music Box\\") for the children's periodical Il giornalino della Domenica.Almanacco Italiano (1903) p. 53 His associates in Florence were a circle of free-thinking artists and literary figures who gathered at the Gambrinus Halle caf√© in the Piazza Vittorio Emanauele (now called the Piazza della Repubblica). Gastaldon and his friends were out of sympathy with the rise of Italian Fascism in the 1920s, and he became increasingly marginalised.Scaccetti (2002) p. 492 Finding it difficult to make a living solely from his music, in the final years of his life he also worked as an art dealer, buying and selling paintings by his friends in the Gambrinus Halle. He never married and lived alone in his house on Via Montanara. On March 6, 1939, Gastaldon suffered a heart attack while walking across the Piazza Vittorio Emmauele and died the same day at the age of 77. He is buried in the Misericordia di Antella Cemetery near Florence.Guerrini (2007); Scaccetti (2002) pp. 492-493 Works During his lifetime, the vast majority of Gastaldon's works were published by two firms, Genasio Venturini in Florence (absorbed by Carisch & J√§nichen in 1905) and Ricordi in Milan. Although several biographical entries, including that in Enciclopedia della musica published by Rizzoli-Ricordi, say that he composed more than 300 songs, Scaccetti suggests that while Gastaldon was prolific, the actual number may be considerably less than this. The work he is almost exclusively remembered for today is his song \\"Musica proibita\\".Sartori (1972) p. 94; Scaccetti (2002) p. 494 \\"Musica proibita\\" \\"Musica proibita\\" (Forbidden Music) is a song within a song. A young woman tells of a handsome young man (\\"un bel garzone\\") who sings a love song beneath her balcony every night. She longs to sing it herself to re-live the thrill she felt, but her mother has forbidden her. Knowing that her mother has left the house, she sings it, and then recalling the last time she heard him, she sings it again even more intensely. The young man's song begins: > Vorrei baciare i tuoi capelli neri, > Le labbra tue e gli occhi tuoi severi... > (I want to kiss your raven hair, > Your lips and your solemn eyes...) A common misconception about the song's origin is that it is an aria from Gastaldon's opera, Mala Pasqua!, and the only surviving piece from the work.This misconception may have come from the entry for Giovanni Verga in the New Grove Dictionary of Opera where Barbara Reynolds lists among the operatic adaptations of his story \\"Cavalleria rusticana\\": \\"Music by Stanislao Gastaldon, with a libretto by Bartocci Fontana, performed in 1888 under the title Mala Pasqua; all that survives is a serenade, revived by Beniamino Gigli with the title 'Musica proibita' ('Forbidden Music')\\". Reynolds also has the date of the Mala Pasqua! premiere wrong, and seems to have been unaware of the many recordings of the song prior to Gigli's. In fact, it is neither. It was published as a salon song for solo soprano and piano in 1881, nine years before Mala Pasqua! premiered. The Mala Pasqua! score (and the libretto) were published by Ricordi in 1890 and copies are held in several libraries in the United States and Europe. Dedicated to the Italian baritone Felice Giachetti, \\"Musica proibita\\" was Gastaldon's second published work, and the first of six songs for which he also wrote the lyrics using the pseudonym \\"Flick-Flock\\". Its success was enormous. Ten years later, a journalist writing in the Gazzetta musicale di Milano recalled how the song soon became a way for timid young lovers all over Italy to express their affection in words that were both uninhibited and emotionally moving. He went on: > What an invasion, what an inundation, how deafening it was back then! In > every house, in every street, in every caf√©, everyone wanted to kiss their > raven hair, in every style and in every possible way of singing out of > tune.A. G. Corriere, Gazetta musicale di Milano, July 1890 quoted in > Scaccetti (2002) p. 494 Shortly after its publication in Italy, \\"Musica proibita\\" was published in English as \\"Unspoken Words\\" (with a text by D'Arcy Jaxone) and in French as \\"La chanson d√©fendue\\". It has since been arranged for every voice type as well as transcribed for flute and violin, violin solo, piano solo, guitar, mandolin, accordion, military band, and solo voice and orchestra. It was recorded in several different versions on early gramophone and cylinder recordings starting in 1900, and although the words express the thoughts of a young girl, \\"Musica proibita\\" became a staple of the tenor concert repertoire (sometimes with the text adjusted).Gramophone (February 1937) p. 37 Among the tenors who have recorded it over the years are Enrico Caruso in 1917, Beniamino Gigli in 1933, Richard Tauber in 1936, Aureliano Pertile, Mario Del Monaco, Mario Lanza in 1952 and 1959, Giuseppe di Stefano in 1961, Luciano Pavarotti in 1984, Placido Domingo, Jos√© Carreras (who also sang it in several Three Tenors concerts) in 1979 and 1993, Andrea Bocelli in 2002,For more on the earliest recordings of \\"Musica proibita\\" and notable later ones, see Scaccetti (2002) pp. 495-496 and Christian Ketter in 2014. \\"Musica proibita\\" was also the inspiration, title, and theme song of a 1943 Italian film directed by Carlo Campogalliani and starring Tito Gobbi, a tortuous story of a noblewoman who opposes the marriage of her niece to the son of a famous baritone who had once been the noblewoman's \\"forbidden love\\".Chiti and Lancia (2005) pp. 229-230 First edition of the score for \\"Amor non √® peccato\\", dedicated to Leonora Genina Mancini Other songs In 1882, Gastaldon wrote \\"Ti vorrei rapire\\" (I want to carry you away), a sequel to \\"Musica proibita\\" which is meant to be sung by the young man referred to in the original song. Like \\"Musica probita\\", the text was by \\"Flick-Flock\\". It had considerable success in its day and was recorded in 1910 by the Italian baritone Taurino Parvis for Columbia Records.American Record Guide (1991) p. 158 A variation on the theme came in 1885 with Gastaldon's \\"Musica non probita!\\" (Music not forbidden!) composed to a text by the theatre critic and poet Luigi Bevacqua Lombardo. Two of Gastaldon's other early songs, \\"Amor non √® peccato\\" (Love is not a sin) and \\"Fiori di sposa\\" (Bridal flowers) were set to texts by a poet identified only as \\"Faustina\\". The first of these was dedicated to Leonora Genina Mancini, daughter of the Italian statesman Pasquale Stanislao Mancini and the poet Laura Beatrice Mancini. Leonora's younger sister Flora ran a famous musical salon, and both sisters wrote poems that had been set by Gastaldon's contemporaries.Limongi (1999) p. 82. See also Scaccetti (2002) p. 501 Giovanni Domenico Bartocci-Fontana, who wrote the libretto for Gastaldon's opera Mala Pasqua!, also wrote the text for his song \\"Perch√© tacete\\" (Why are you silent?). Other poets whose texts were set by Gastaldon included Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer, Olindo Guerrini (under the pseudonym Lorenzo Stecchetti), Emilio Praga, Armando Perotti, Annie Vivanti, Fausto Salvatori, and Domenico Milelli (under the pseudonym Conte di Lara). Of all his songs, Gastaldon's favourite was reportedly \\"Mamma\\", dedicated to the memory of his mother, with lyrics by the poet and playwright Giovanni Arrighi.Scaccetti (2002) p. 499. For a chronological list of Gastaldon's songs see pp. 501-504 It was recorded by Renato Zanelli for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1921.University of California, Santa Barbara Libraries. Encyclopedic Discography of Victor Recordings: Matrix B-25392 In a departure from his usual genre of songs for solo voice and piano, Gastaldon also wrote two choral pieces, \\"Viva il Re\\" and \\"Inno della Dante Alighieri\\". The patriotic anthem \\"Viva il Re\\" (Long Live the King) with text by Giosu√® Carducci was published by Ricordi 1915.Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze. Catalogue: Gasaldon \\"Inno della Dante Alighieri\\" with text by Augusto Franchetti was written as an anthem for the Dante Alighieri Society. It was first performed on September 28, 1902 in the Piazza del Campo in Siena for the XIII Congress of the Societ√† Dante Alighieri and published the following year by the Florentine firm of Bemporad & Figlio.Biblioteca Civica del Comune di Riva del Garda. Catalogue: Gastaldon Stage works Although, Mala Pasqua was the first of Gastaldon's operas to be performed, he had previously composed Fatma, an opera-ballet in four acts and a prologue with a libretto by Marco Praga. According to The Monthly Musical Record of 1887, it had been accepted for performance at La Scala and in 1888, the French periodical Le M√©nestrel reported that it was nearly finished.The Monthly Musical Record (1887) p. 70; Le M√©nestrel (May 6, 1888) p. 149 However, it was never performed and does not appear to have been published. In 1891, after the premiere of Mala Pasqua!, he began work on what was to have been a three-act comedy loosely based on the Alexandre Dumas novel Twenty Years After. Initially called Rosa Minchon and then Mazzarinata, it too was never performed and was probably never finished.Scaccetti (2002) p. 491 (also the source for the premieres of Gastaldon's stage works) Although not an opera, and lasting only seven minutes, Gastaldon's Il sonetto di Dante, a setting of Dante's sonnet \\"Tanto gentile e tanto onesta pare\\", was written to be performed on stage by a tenor in the role of Dante, surrounded by scenery depicting 14th century Florence. According to the Revue Musicale de Lyon, it had little success despite the talent of Giuseppe Taccani, who sang the piece at its premiere.Revue Musicale de Lyon (December 16, 1906) pp. 315-316 ;Chronological list of performed stage works *Mala Pasqua! ‚Äì opera in three acts; libretto by Giovanni Domenico Bartocci-Fontana based on Verga's short story, \\"Cavalleria rusticana\\"; premiered April 9, 1890 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome *Pater ‚Äì opera in one act; libretto by Vittorio Bianchi based on Fran√ßois Copp√©e's play of the same name; premiered April 15, 1894 at the Teatro Manzoni in Milan *Stellina ‚Äì opera in one act; libretto by Vittorio Bianchi; published 1896, premiered March 25, 1905 in a double bill with Pater at the Teatro Niccolini in Florence *Il sonetto di Dante ‚Äì described as a visione scenica; text by Dante Alighieri from La Vita Nuova, \\"Tanto gentile e tanto onesta pare\\"; premiered November 17, 1906 at the Politeama Genovese in Genoa *Il Reuccio di Caprilana ‚Äì operetta in three acts; libretto by F√©licien Champsaur; premiered April 4, 1914 at the Teatro Balbo in Turin Notes and references Sources *Almanacco Italiano (1903). \\"Musica: S.

The size of the park is 26,485 hectares. Mokala is the Setswana name for the magnificent camel thorn, a tree species typical of the arid western interior and common in the area. There is currently 70 km of accessible roads in the national park. History The new park effectively replaces the Vaalbos National Park , which was deproclaimed to comply with land claims and diamond prospecting rights. In 1998, SANParks undertook a study of five areas to determine the best replacement locations. A 19 611-hectare tract of land, Wintershoek, was subsequently selected. In 2005, the land was purchased and plans for the re-introduction of game were formed. The first five animals, a group of giraffes, were released into the reserve in June 2006, and a year later it was officially proclaimed. The cultural diversity of the area consist of many San rock engravings and Anglo Boer War battlefields. Climate The Northern Cape is a dry region with fluctuating temperatures and differing topographies. The weather is typically that of desert and semi-desert areas. The annual rainfall is never high (between 300‚Äì500 mm, average 400 mm) and is always lower than the rate of evaporation. Summers (from December to February) are hot with temperatures usually between 33 ¬∞C and 36 ¬∞C. Although not common, summer temperatures in the Northern Cape can exceed 40 ¬∞C. During the summer months, the rainy season thunderstorms occurs in the central and eastern areas and is often accompanied by heavy thunderstorms, whereas winter rainfall occur mainly in the western region. During winter (June to August), day temperatures are generally mild to warm (22 ¬∞C), but at night it can be cold, often below 0 ¬∞C. Landscape This region is the transition zone of the savanna (Kalahari and Nama Karoo) biomes; the former being flat and sandy dotted with camel thorns, umbrella thorns, puzzle bushes and haystack-like sociable weaver nests constructed in the larger trees, and the latter characterised by rocky lava outcrops, calcrete and shales. The southern region of the park, closest to the entrance gate, is more plains-like, with isolated camel thorns and tall grasses. The central regions of the park consist of the Karoo-like habitats, with long rows of rocky outcrops interspersed with flat areas of grass and scrub. The base and lower slopes of the outcrops receive extra run-off and are better vegetated. Wildlife This park is home to a number of endangered species and the main purpose of the park is to protect these species. Cape buffalo, black rhino and roan antelope are to be found, besides a range of smaller species. There are mosquitoes during summer, but this is a malaria-free zone. * Aardvark (Orycteropus afer) * Black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) * Black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) * Blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) * Common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) * Eland (Taurotragus oryx) * Gemsbok (Oryx gazella) * Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) * Impala * Kudu * Mountain reedbuck * Plains zebra * Red hartebeest * Roan antelope * Southern African ground squirrel * Southern African hedgehog * Smith's red rock rabbit * Sable antelope * Springbok * Suricate * Tsessebe * White rhino Birding A bird list is available at reception. In summer, the best time to go birding in Mokala National Park is at sunrise, particularly between 07h30 and 09h00. The level of endemism at Mokala is high. The Kalahari sandveld habitats hold more bird species than the rocky areas, especially during times of higher rainfall. The endemic black- chested prinia thrives in the arid conditions of the park. Chestnut-vented warblers are attracted to the lawns surrounding the lodges. A fairly tame pair of Cape buntings frequent Mosu Lodge, using the buildings as an artificial nest structure, while greater striped swallows nest beneath the eaves of the restaurant's thatched roof. * Ashy tit * Cape penduline-tit * Southern fiscal * Crimson-breasted shrike * Familiar chat * Fawn-coloured lark * Fiscal flycatcher * Fork-tailed drongo * Grey-backed cisticola * Kalahari scrub-robin * Karoo scrub-robin * Lark-like bunting * Marico flycatcher * Mountain wheatear * Northern black korhaan * Orange River white-eye * Pririt batis * Red-headed finch * Rufous-eared warbler * Sabota lark * Scaly-feathered finch * Short-toed rock-thrush * Sociable weaver * Southern ant-eating chat * White- backed vulture * White-rumped swift * Yellow-bellied eremomela * Yellow canary Flora Trees * Acacia erioloba (camel thorn, kameeldoring in Afrikaans), * Acacia tortilis (haak-en-steek in Afrikaans), * Acacia mellifera (blackthorn, swarthaak in Afrikaans), * Ziziphus mucronata (buffalo thorn, blinkblaar-wag-'n-bietjie in Afrikaans).

Mosu Lodge overlooks a waterhole, which is intended to be a gathering place for game and birds. Besides the lodges, visitors can also stay at Stofdam Bird hide, Kameeldoorn Tree House and the rustic Motswedi camping site, utilizing their own camping gear. Sites at Motswedi each offer a private toilet, shower (solar geyser) and a built-in breakfast nook overlooking the waterhole. No power points are available here. Two restaurants are situated at Mosu Lodge and Lilydale; meals at both need to be pre-booked at reception and Lilydale only serves breakfast and lunch. Self- catering wilderness camps and luxury private camp sites are planned for the future. How to get there The park is at this point not well signposted, but from Kimberley is reached via the Hopetown road (N12), after 57 km right at the Hayfield/Heuningneskloof crossing (estimated time from Kimberley to Mokala 90 minutes). From Cape Town's direction, follow the N12 north past Hopetown, and turn left after 65 km at the crossing. After 21 km of gravel road, the gate of Mokala National Park is on the right hand side. Access through the main entrance is arranged by intercom, as the gate is remotely controlled from the main office. See also * Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park References * Anon. 16 Februarie 2007.

They did however, manage to baptise the people inside the stronghold. In spring 1211, a larger objective for the Livonian Brothers of the Sword was to take the stronghold of Viljandi. They plundered the neighbourhood, robbed their food supplies, and killed and kidnapped the villagers who were staying in the villages nearby. Some of the prisoners were brought in front of the stronghold where they were killed to frighten the defenders, before being cast off into the moat. In the first collision in front of the stronghold gate, the defenders managed to fend off with heavy casualties the attackers and equip themselves with the enemy's equipment. The besiegers built a turret, the moat was filled with wood and the turret was rolled onto it. From there they threw spears and crossbowmen fired upon the defenders. The Estonians also tried to light the turret. It was here the Germans first used a bricole on Estonian soil. With the bricole they threw rocks into the stronghold day and night, inflicting relatively serious damage. Soon the invaders managed to break one of the fortifications, but behind it there was another. Also, the Estonians were able to put out the fires lit on parts of the stronghold. Unable to take the stronghold in five days, the invaders started negotiating on the sixth day. Because there was a lack of water, many wounded and killed in the stronghold, the elders were willing to make peace with the besiegers. They allowed only the priests inside the stronghold, who were said to have sprinkled holy water on the stronghold, houses, men, and women. Massive baptism didn't occur, it was deferred because of \\"very enormous bloodspilling\\". Having sons of elders and noblemen as hostages, the German army retreated.

The Declaration was created by the Global Canopy Programme, and has been signed by over 200 NGOs, business leaders, scientists and conservationists. The Declaration was created as carbon credits from land use, land-use change and forestry were omitted from the Clean Development Mechanism for the First Commitment Period of the Kyoto Protocol despite contributing 18-25% of all emissions.1 Stern N. (2006). The Stern Review on the economics of Climate Change. Cambridge University Press. Rationale Deforestation in the next five years will release more carbon dioxide than all aircraft since the Wright Brothers until at least 2025; Forests First in the Fight Against Climate Change Global Canopy Programme, 2007 however, credits from reduced deforestation were omitted from the Clean Development Mechanism for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, so there is little incentive for forested countries to reduce their deforestation rates. The Forests NOW declaration seeks to establish new market based mechanisms to protect the ecosystem services that forests provide in biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and global and local hydrological and mineral cycles. Prescriptions The Declaration prescribes six changes to the existing carbon market frameworks: * Ensure that carbon credits for reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) and the protection of standing forests are included in all national and international carbon markets, especially those created by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. * Simplify and expand carbon market rules, including the Clean Development Mechanism, to encourage reforestation, afforestation and sustainable forest management. * Include tropical forest and land use carbon credits in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, while maintaining strong incentives to reduce industrial emissions. * Encourage mechanisms that recognise the value of carbon stocks and forest ecosystem services, and support appropriate voluntary carbon market standards. * Provide assistance for developing nations to build capacity to fully participate in the carbon markets, and to evaluate the ecosystem services their forests provide. * Incentivize the sustainable use of degraded land and ecosystems, and remove incentives that encourage forest destruction.

The commission is empowered to educate citizens about their civil rights, investigate alleged civil rights violations, and carry out studies and investigations. Amendments to its organic law also empowers it to appear as a \\"friend of the court\\" in cases that the commission deems to have an important effect on civil rights in Puerto Rico. Overview The commission was created in 1965 under governor Roberto S√°nchez Vilella as an independent agency under the Department of Justice. But it was not until 1996 that the commission was made part of the legislative branch, due, in part, to the efforts of governor Pedro Rossell√≥. The commission is known to speak to and educate children in Puerto Rico's elementary schools about their civil rights. Equal rights for the Puerto Rican LGBT community are defended by the commission. Structurally, the entity is composed of five members that are appointed to a six-years term by the governor of Puerto Rico, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. Its current members include its chair, Georgina Candal Segurola, Esther Vicente Rivera, Rosemary Borges Cap√≥, Ruth Miriam Perez Maldonado and Hiram A. Mel√©ndez Juarbe. Other individuals that have served in the commission include former Sen. Luis Mu√±oz Rivera, newspaper publisher Antonio Luis Ferr√©, former Resident Commissioner Baltasar Corrada del R√≠o, and the late Efra√≠n Gonz√°lez Tejera. In spite of complaints that the commission is chronically underfunded, the entity has had a significant influence in Puerto Rican government operations. In mid-2019, it requested Julia Keleher, the Secretary of Education, be investigated for comments she made about how contracts were being awarded. Keleher ended up being arrested for breaking the law and her arrest along with Telegramgate contributed to then Governor Ricardo Rossello having to resign from his position as governor. In late 2019, the commission demanded to know the number of inmate deaths that have occurred over the last five years, fearing that perhaps inmates' rights are being violated while incarcerated in Puerto Rico's prisons and jails. The commission also annually selects the recipients of the Thurgood Marshall Award, which recognizes the commitment to civil rights of one law student from each of Puerto Rico's three law schools.

After service in World War II, she was sold to the Royal New Zealand Navy and renamed HMNZS Kaniere (F426) in September 1948. After service in the Korean War, she was used as a training ship from 1957. She was sold in 1966 for breaking up in Hong Kong. HMS Loch Achray After sea trials Loch Achray joined the 8th Escort Group in March 1945 for service in the Western Approaches. On 12 April, in the Irish Sea, the Group forced the to the surface and engaged her with gunfire. The crew abandoned ship and the U-boat was taken in tow after being boarded, but sank the next day. After the German surrender in May 1945 Loch Achray took part in \\"Operation Deadlight\\", escorting surrendered German U-boats from Scapa Flow to Loch Ryan. In September 1945 Loch Achray joined the East Indies Escort Force in the Indian Ocean in supporting military operations and assisting with returning liberated prisoners of the Japanese to Singapore. The ship returned to Portsmouth in July 1946, and was placed in reserve. In 1948, she was part of a lot of six Loch-class frigates refitted and sold at a combined cost of ¬£232,750 to New Zealand. HMNZS Kaniere Kaniere was commissioned in Portsmouth, England on 27 September 1948, and arrived in Auckland, New Zealand in January 1949, joining the 11th Frigate Flotilla. Patrols and exercises occupied her until November 1951 when she was put in reserve. Recommissioned in November 1952, she joined the United Nations Naval Task Group based at Sasebo, carrying out her first patrol along the west coast of Korea in April 1953. She remained there after the declaration of the cease- fire in August, finally returning to Auckland in April 1954. In September the warship joined the 3rd Frigate Squadron, Far East Fleet, based at Singapore, as part of the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve. She was detached to UN support duties off Korea, based at Sasebo, from October 1954 until May 1955, and returned to Auckland in July. After a refit she rejoined the 3rd Frigate Squadron in March 1956, once again being engaged in UN support duties from June to July. From October 1956 until April 1957 Kaniere helped address the Malayan Emergency off Borneo, returning to Auckland in June to refit. Kaniere was then assigned as a training ship, taking part in exercises, training cruises and port visits. On 17 November 1958, Kaniere towed the coaster Port Waikato, which had engine failure near the Chatham Islands, to Port Lyttelton. On 3 August 1959 Kaniere collided with the ferry Makora in dense fog off Devonport. The ship was decommissioned in 1961, and served as a harbour training ship until 1965. Kaniere was sold for scrapping in 1966. Decommissioning and fate On 18 January 1967 Kaniere was paired with her sister ship and towed by the tug Daisy to Hong Kong for breaking up.

Career Born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Cozman became a fan of professional wrestling and often attended local house shows with his father growing up. Interested in pursuing a career in professional wrestling, he eventually became friends with wrestling photographer Bob Leonard. In 1984, Leonard introduced him to Archie Gouldie and began training under him soon after. Working with Gouldie during the next six months, he eventually made his professional debut in Stampede Wrestling in early 1985. Touring the Maritimes with Emile Dupr√©e's Grand Prix Wrestling with Gouldie and Leo Burke during the summer as \\"Danny Young\\", he also traveled to the United States following Gouldie and Burke to Texas where they wrestled for promoter Joe Blanchard. During the next five years, Cozman would work exclusively for Stampede Wrestling, feuding with Kerry Brown before the promotion closed in 1990. Retiring from professional wrestling, Cozman worked as a security guard during the next several years although, during 1995, he and Venom would spend three months training wrestlers for the Prairie Wrestling Alliance although the promoter later decided against starting the promotion. In 1997, he became involved in Wild West Wrestling when the promotion began holding events in Saskatchewan. Later that year, while at a WWF house show in Regina with Bob Leonard, Bruce and Owen Hart, an outline for an in-ring persona was discussed in order to arrange a tryout with the World Wrestling Federation. Cozman talked with Jim Cornette about entering the WWF, however, Cozman and Bruce Hart continued working on a character outline and later brought in Cozman with the character when he reopened Stampede Wrestling in 1999. Making his debut as \\"Principal\\" Richard Pound, Cozman soon began one of the most dominant \\"heels\\" in the promotion as leader of the stable The Honor Roll and later defeated Tiger Khan and Greg Pawluk in a three-way match for the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Champion in Calgary, Alberta on November 5, 1999. Cozman would become the first champion since the promotion closed in December 1989. Defeating Tatanka for the Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship in April 2000, he later lost the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight title to Tiger Mahatma Khan on June 2. The winner of the match would earn a match against Sabu for the Stampede Pacific Heavyweight Championship on June 9. Cozman would continue defending the Stampede North American title until losing to Bruce Hart on April 13, 2001. The following month, he was backstage with several other Canadian independent wrestlers such as \\"Wildman\\" Gary Williams at Monday Night Raw when the WWF toured Alberta in late May. Although he did not compete at the event, he was later invited by the WWF for a tryout match in Tacoma or Seattle, Washington in June. Appearing at the fourth annual Brian Pillman Memorial Show, he represented Stampede Wrestling in an interpromotional match losing to East Coast Wrestling Association veteran J.R. Ryder in Cincinnati, Ohio in August 2001. In negotiations with Sonny Onoo to tour Great Britain with WrestleXpress in March 2002, he later faced Bruce Hart on the undercard of the Stampede Wrestling 50th Anniversary Show at the Ogden Legion in Calgary, Alberta on May 1, 2003. In late 2004, he also faced Wavell Starr and Zack Mercury while in Renegade Wrestling. Leaving Stampede Wrestling in 2005, he toured Western Canada with various independent promotions and, in a tag team match with \\"Taylormade\\" Todd Myers, Cozman lost to Big Daddy Kash and The Honky Tonk Man in an event for High Impact Wrestling Canada in Regina on March 24, 2006. He again lost to the Honky Tonk Man in a singles match the next night thanks in part to outside interference by Bob Leonard. The following month, he made a guest appearance along with Emile Dupree, Hubert Gallant, Rick Martel, Butcher Vachon, promoters Al Zinck and Bob Leonard at a \\"Recognition Night\\" banquet honoring the Cormier brothers Leo, Yvon, Rudy Kay, and Bobby Kay. The banquet, held in the Cormier's hometown of Memramcook, New Brunswick, was also part of a bluegrass music festival and fundraiser for the local volunteer fire department. On July 19, after a two year absence, Cozman returned to High Impact Wrestling Canada at Pile O'Bones Rumble XVIII. He was one of the 30 participants in the Pile O'Bones Rumble itself. Cozman wrestled his final match in October 2013 in Regina, SK against longtime rival, King Kash. A couple of weeks following the match, Cozman was forced to retire due to illness. On Friday, October 23, 2015, at High Impact Wrestling's \\"Monster Brawl\\" event in Regina, SK, John Cozman was inducted into the HIW Hall of Fame by longtime friend, Bob Leonard.

David M. Cheney. Retrieved January 4, 2017 (in Latin) Life Tomb in Segovia Cathedral. Early years Covarruvias was born in Toledo, Spain, on 25 July 1512. His father was Alonso de Covarrubias (1488-1570), an architect who designed the New Kings chapel of the Cathedral of Toledo. Diego's younger brother, Antonio de Covarrubias (1514/24-1602), would be a professor of law at the University of Salamanca and served as consejero of Castile. Diego de Covarrubias was educated at the University of Salamanca, where he studied canon law under Mart√≠n de Azpilcueta and theology under Francisco de Vitoria and Domingo de Soto. At the age of twenty-one, Covarruvias was appointed professor of canon law in the University of Salamanca. Later on he was entrusted with the work of reforming that institution, already venerable for its age, and the legislation which he drew up looking to this end remained in effect long after his time. Such was the recognized eminence of his legal science that he was styled the Bartolus of Spain. His vast legal learning was always set forth with a peculiar beauty of diction and lucidity of style.Says von Scherer (see below). (note by Melody) His genius was universal, and embraced all the sciences subsidiary to, and illustrative of, the science of law. If report be true, the large library of Oviedo, where at the age of twenty-six he became professor, did not contain a single volume which he had not annotated. Episcopate On April 24, 1556, Covarruvias was designated by Charles V for the archiepiscopal see of San Domingo in the New World, whither, however, he never went. On January 26, 1560, he was appointed Bishop of Ciudad Rodrigo in Spain. On April 28, 1560, he was consecrated bishop by Fernando de Vald√©s y Salas, Archbishop of Sevilla with Mart√≠n P√©rez de Ayala, Bishop of Guadix, and Diego de los Cobos Molina, Bishop of √Åvila, as co-consecrators. In this capacity he attended the Council of Trent, where, according to the statement of his nephew, conjointly with Cardinal Ugo Buoncompagni (afterwards Gregory XIII), he was authorized to formulate the reform-decrees (De Reformatione) of the council. Pressure of other duties having prevented Buoncompagni from doing his part of the work, so the task devolved upon Covarruvias alone. The text of these decrees, therefore, formally approved by the council, we apparently owe to him.Von Scherer, in Kirchenlexikon, III, 1170, doubts the accuracy of this tradition. (note by Melody) Having returned to Spain, Covarruvias was in 1565 transferred to the See of Segovia. Up to this time his extraordinary talents had been discovered in matters more or less scholastic only; they were hereafter to reveal themselves also in practical affairs of state. Appointed in 1572 a member of the Council of Castile, he was two years later raised to the presidency of the Council of State. In the discharge of this office he was eminently successful. While president of the Council of State he was nominated by Philip II for the Bishopric of Cuenca, but death prevented him from assuming his duties. Covarruvias died in Madrid, on 27 September 1577. While Bishop, he was the principal co-consecrator of Pedro de la Pe√±a, Bishop of Quito. He was buried in a marble sarcophagus in Segovia Cathedral, near the old entrance to the cathedral built by the Catholic Monarchs, which today leads to the cloister. Works Opera omnia, 1734 (Milano, Fondazione Mansutti). The principal work of Covarruvias is his Variarum resolutionum ex jure pontificio regio et c√¶sareo libri IV. He wrote also on testaments, betrothal and marriage, oaths, excommunication, prescription, restitution, etc. Quite distinct in character from his other productions is his numismatic treatise, Veterum numismatum collatio cum his qu√¶ modo expenduntur, etc. (1594). His complete works have been several times edited, the Antwerp edition (5 vols., 1762) being the best.

He then went on to teach PE at St George's Academy, Sleaford but has since retired from that post. He began his career on schoolboy forms with Lincoln City whilst also making occasional appearances for hometown club Sleaford Town before playing for Heckington United in the Grantham League. After winning England caps at Schoolboy and Youth levels, Wallington signed for Walsall, turning professional in October 1971. After just 11 league appearances, Leicester City manager Jimmy Bloomfield paid ¬£30,000 to secure his services. Wallington began his time at Leicester as understudy to Peter Shilton and it was not until Shilton departed to Stoke City in 1974 that Wallington was able to establish himself. However, once recognised as the first-choice goalkeeper, Wallington was rarely out of the team for the next ten seasons, being an ever-present for six successive seasons from 1975‚Äì1981 and establishing a club record of 331 consecutive appearances. His long-service to the Foxes was recognised with a testimonial season, the highlight being a testimonial match with Nottingham Forest on 20 October 1982. He went on to make 460 appearances in all competitions for Leicester City, placing him equal third on their all-time appearance records. With Ian Andrews emerging as the number one choice at Leicester, Wallington moved on to Derby County in the summer of 1985, a fee of ¬£25,000 securing his services. In his first season, he helped the Rams secure promotion from the then Third Division before winning the Second Division title in 1986‚Äì87. Wallington would play no part in Derby's return to the top- flight as his place was taken by new-signing Peter Shilton whom Wallington had understudied at Leicester at the start of his career. In the summer of 1988, just a few weeks short of his 36th birthday, Wallington signed for Lincoln City, nearly twenty years after his initial association with the club as a schoolboy. He would remain at Lincoln for three seasons, being named \\"Player of the Season\\" in 1989/90 and elected number 64 in Lincoln's 100 league legends in 2006, before making his 577th and final league appearance against Blackpool in April 1991 at the age of 38 years and 201 days. At the time, this made him the second oldest player to appear for Lincoln in the league though he has now slipped to fifth position. He then returned to his home town of Sleaford to become a secondary school teacher whilst he also spent time coaching with the England U18 set-up. In September 1994 he came out of retirement to assist Grantham Town on a couple of occasions, before moving up to the role of Assistant Manager in January 1995, leaving the club at the end of the season.

They are natural products with strong antibacterial potency. So far, katanosin A and katanosin B (lysobactin) have been described. Sources Katanosins have been isolated from the fermentation broth of microorganisms, such as Cytophaga. or the Gram-negative bacterium Lysobacter sp. Structure Katanosins are cyclic depsipeptides (acylcyclodepsipeptides). These non-proteinogenic structures are not regular proteins from primary metabolism. Rather, they originate from bacterial secondary metabolism. Accordingly, various non-proteinogenic (non- ribosomal) amino acids are found in katanosins, such as 3-hydroxyleucine, 3-hydroxyasparagine, allothreonine and 3-hydroxyphenylalanine. All katanosins have a cyclic and a linear segment (‚Äúlariat structure‚Äù). The peptidic ring is closed with an ester bond (lactone). Katanosin A and B differ in the amino acid position 7. The minor metabolite katanosin A has a valine in this position, whereas the main metabolite katanosin B carries an isoleucine. Biological activity Katanosin antibiotics target the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. They are highly potent against problematic Gram-positive hospital pathogens such as staphylococci and enterococci. Their promising biological activity attracted various biological and chemical research groups. Their in-vitro potency is comparable with the current ‚Äúlast defence‚Äù antibiotic vancomycin. Chemical synthesis The first total syntheses of katanosin B (lysobactin) have been described in 2007.

The region's first theatre-in-the-round, it specialised in theatre for children and young people. The Round opened in September 2007, and was home to the Bruvvers Theatre Company. The building in which The Round was housed is a former flax mill designed by John Dobson in 1848. The 180-seat theatre slotted behind a listed facade in a courtyard space between warehouses on Lime Street. The Round was conceived by the Bruvvers Theatre Company artistic director Mike Mould who bought the derelict Cluny building in 1982 with the intention of creating a theatre within its walls. In 2005, Mould sent a letter to his friends asking each to donate ¬£1 to help fund the cost of building the theatre. Bruvvers director and television scriptwriter Julie Blackie suggested alternative methods of fundraising. The theatre had one wall with a fixed block of 40 seats and three balconies, with the remaining seats moveable according to the needs of each production According to the company, there was \\"one main route onto the stage for the performers, but also a few secret passages to add an element of surprise.\\" The company filed for voluntary liquidation in May 2008, just eight months after its launch. The Round Theatre had been built with capital funding from a consortium of parties in the Ouseburn district of Newcastle but had failed to secure funding for programming or administrative costs.

In all cases, the use of the term \\"capital\\" is to denote that the security is relatively junior in the issuing corporation's order of priorities in claims for its assets. Convertibles Capital notes are a form of convertible security exercisable into shares. They are equity vehicles. Capital notes are similar to warrants, except that they often do not have an expiration date or an exercise price (hence, the entire consideration the company expects to receive, for its future issue of shares, is paid when the capital note is issued). Capital notes may be issued in connection with a debt-for-equity swap restructuring: instead of promptly issuing the debt-replacing shares, the company issues convertible securities, in order to postpone the event of share dilution. Bonds Alternately, a capital note is a bond with a very long maturity horizon, reaching several decades (sometimes as much as 50 or 100 years). Unlike equity securities, these capital notes do mature at some point; therefore, they form part of the company's liabilities and not part of equity. However, since their maturity is so far in the future, they are treated as equity for practical purposes; the company keeps the money raised through them inside its balance sheet for a very long time. Banks and other financial institutions issue these bonds to satisfy regulatory demands regarding capital requirements, specifically under the Basel Accords. In the Basel \\"tiers\\" system, capital notes are treated as close to equity, as both reinforce the bank's \\"capital\\". Additionally, bank capital notes are usually not collateralized and are contractually subordinated, forming a junior class of debt. Similar terms might be found in redeemable preferred shares. Contrary to the warrant-like capital notes described above, these capital notes are usually not convertible, so they represent no current or future stake in the corporation's equity (share capital). Structured finance In structured finance, the capital note is the most junior security issued by a structured investment vehicle. It is comparable to the equity tranche of a CDO. Investors who buy the capital notes are the first in line to bear risk if the cash flows from the SIV's assets are insufficient to cover promised payments to all investors.

The centre was headed by Professor Klaus Scherer, is now headed by David Sander, and researches emotions in the areas of cognitive neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, economics, archaeology and affective computing. It has project focuses in cognitive appraisal, expression, social and legal regulation, norms and values and aesthetic emotions. Over 100 researchers from different universities attend in the NCCR Affective Sciences.http://www.affective-sciences.org/home The Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research tries to train as many new affective young scientists as possible. They have a program devoted to the Education and Training Program which helps train and prepare researchers in the affective sciences for the future. The goal of Education and Training Program is to encourage approach towards affective phenomena without losing the punitive profession required for a professional career between disciplines.http://www.affective-sciences.org/teaching-activities There is an annual program called the International Summer School in Affective Sciences (ISSAS) which is available for young researchers worldwide. The summer school tries to bring together arts and emotions of students using many methods including literature, neuroscience, psychology, and musicology. The Centre's main research goals include attempting to understand affective phenomena, such as emotions and motivation, through research and analysis. Affective phenomena are complex and difficult to understand. They are described as intricate events in human behaviour and experience. The centre focusses on three parts of emotions: emotions being complicated reactions to our surroundings, emotions as being disruptive and needing conscious control and regulation and emotions as being a regulating force of today‚Äôs society. Therefore, individual research projects are organized around three main categories of research relating to these aspects: emotion awareness and elicitation, emotion regulation and the social purposes of emotions.http://www.affective- sciences.org/research-program-overview Notes and references International summer school in affective sciences.

Douglas. The Early Castles of Mar, Proceedings of the Society: 102, 10 December 1928Hogan, C. Michael. Elsick Mounth, The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham (2007) Aboyne Castle was formerly derelict, but was restored by the present Marquess of Huntly in 1979. Architecture The castle was constructed by Bysets, Lords of Strathdee and Aboyne before 1233 as a motte-and-bailey. Edward I sent instructions for its fortification in 1307. It was later turned into a stone keep. in 1671, the west wing was rebuilt as a tower house by Charles, first Earl of Aboyne, parts of which are still visible. A mansion house was added in 1701. An east wing was added in 1801. In 1869, kitchen improvements were made using granite and stepped gables. The Mansion House was updated in the 1880s by Sir Cunliffe Brooks by adding baronial-style ornamentation. George Truefitt did some restoration work in the later part of the 19th century. It was remodelled in 1986 by Ian Begg. Historical picture of the castle The structure is three-storey with basement and attic. The east elevation is symmetrical, while the north (entrance), south, and west are asymmetrical. A heraldic panel is located between the second and third windows of the north elevation, as is a decorative ironwork finial and a weather-cock finial. There is a baronial tower house, an angled tower to the northwest, a four-storey basement, and an attic tower to the north. The oldest section of the castle is the northwest which incorporates a balustrade atop a five-storey circular tower that is corbelled to square. This tower was replicated later at the northeast. The castle is harled and lime washed. Eaves are course, there are several turrets, a possible secret passageway, and a monk's room. There are a number of small-pane windows, as well as a grey slate roof with tiled ridge. A doorway to the principal floor is reached by stone steps, and a small-pane glazed timber door is located to the right of the basement. Immediately to the north of the castle, there is a harled wall with an enclosed courtyard. Ownership In 1242, after the expulsion from Scotland of John and Walter Byset of Clan Bissett, who had been alleged of the murder of Patrick, Earl of Atholl, at Haddington, East Lothian, Aboyne Castle passed to the Knights Templar in that year. It passed next to the Frasers of Cowie, before passing yet again, this time by marriage, to Sir William de Keith, Great Marischal of Scotland around 1355. In 1449, De Keith's great granddaughter, Joan, brought the castle by marriage to Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly (1449). Its present owner is the Marquis of Huntly whose family has owned it since the early 15th century. Grounds There is a large extent of planted policies on both sides of the River Dee, including ornamental plantations and the Loch of Aboyne. On the Upper Dee, Aboyne Castle grounds are used as a fly fishing fish beat. It is fished in agreement with Glen Tanar Estate (Craigendinnie Beat). Within the Aboyne Castle Policies, there is included an artificial, islet-studded Loch of Aboyne measuring 3 √ó 2 fur. The burn of Aboyne has kept its ancient name, Allach, only near the castle where the Allach Bridge was built over the burn. Relic The Formaston Stone, a relic of historical importance, is preserved. Dating from between 800 and 1000, it has a mirror symbol, a decorated Celtic cross, and an Ogham inscription. Preservation Aboyne Castle, including its gateway, courtyard, and northern boundary walls became a category B listed building on 24 November 1972. Several other structures became listed building such as the early 19th century walled garden, garden house and the Wee House, listed at category C(s) on 30 March 2000; and the triple span, segmental-arched Allach Bridge, constructed in 1787 of coursed grey granite, category B on 30 March 2000.

However the venture was not a success, and the Pavilion closed after only six seasons following which Broadbent sold the land to the Palace and Derby Castle Company. Gaiety Theatre The new owners enlisted the services of Frank Matcham in order to carry out an extensive renovation of the venue with Matcham presenting his plans for the theatre to Douglas Corporation in March, 1899. Part of the plans saw the creation of a glass ceiling in order to afford maximum light together with an elegant and playful interior inside the narrow shell of the Pavilion's Belfast Roof and the remains of the Villa house. The stage was extended by and the resulting loss of seating was made up for by enlarging the circle and adding the third level. The under-stage machinery was installed by the Douglas firm of J.L. Killip & Collister of Tynwald Street. The new entrance facade, with its upstairs loggia, pedimented towers and flamboyant stucco decoration, took its inspiration from the buildings of the Italian Renaissance, while the interior, with its ceiling paintings and ornate plasterwork, combined Baroque and Elizabethan elements. An ingenious feature also found in Matcham's theatre in Buxton, Derbyshire, was what was known as a \\"sunburner\\". This consisted of a main roof air vent about a large circular glass window in which there was originally a gaslight. As the window heated up, it caused the air around it to rise and then fresh air would rush in through vents to replace it. The theatre opened on 16 July 1900 with a West End production of \\"The Telephone Girl\\" featuring Ada Blanche. The theatre enjoyed considerable success in the Edwardian era until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, but then much harder times set in after the war and the theatre fell into decline along with the Island's tourist industry. Various attempts were made to regain its former commercial success, including installation of cinema equipment in the 1920s and a 1938 ice show. The Second World War period and aftermath saw deterioration of the building outside the means of the owners to repair and by 1970 the theatre came \\"just one signature away\\" from being demolished. In 1971 the Isle of Man Government acquired the dilapidated building from the Palace and Derby Castle Company for the sum of ¬£41,000. It also granted a further ¬£9,000 for essential repairs, as the circle bar, toilets and stage all needed a revamp. Restoration In 1976 the restoration began under the direction of architect and theatre expert, Victor Glasstone. The theatre underwent further restoration, under the direction of Mervin Stokes, MBE, from the 1990s to replicate its 1900 opening condition in time for the centenary celebration in 2000. Exactly 100 years after opening, on 16 July 2000, the centenary was celebrated with a performance of \\"The Telephone Girl\\" which opened the Gaiety in 1900 and following which was a performance of \\"The Corsican Brothers,\\" a popular play which in Victorian times and a special 'Corsican Trap' was constructed for the performance. It is believed to be the only working Corsican Trap in the World. Another unique feature of the theatre is the working Act Drop depicting a dancing lady. The restoration of the Gaiety Theatre was directed over several years by the Theatre Manager of the day, Mervin Russell Stokes, who was later made an MBE for his contribution to the project. It was he who, with help, arranged for the funding and closely supervised the work done, carrying out some of it himself, always with a view to strict authenticity, even down to having the original paint colours, wallpaper and carpeting recreated. He went to great lengths to return the building to as near its original appearance as possible. He was responsible for the Gaiety's famous 'Corsican Trap,' and other period stage machinery, and it is to him, more than any other individual, that credit must be given. \\"A Full Circle - 100 Years of the Gaiety Theatre and Opera House\\" by Roy McMillan, Keith Uren Publishing, 2000, ISBN 0 - 9538628 - 0 - 1, and \\"Saving the Gaiety: And Other Misadventures of a Theatre Manager\\" by Mervin Russell Stokes, Lily Publications (1857), Foreword and introduction by Timothy West and Prunella Scales. Current use Today the theatre continues with productions by local companies and touring productions of musicals, drama and opera. It now forms a part of the Villa-Gaiety complex together with the Villa Marina, a nearby 1,500 seat auditorium.

After starting out at Sporting, he went on to play for a host of clubs in a variety of countries, without settling anywhere. Club career Born in Estoril, Lisbon District, Pa√≠m was once regarded as the most promising young player in Portugal by Cristiano Ronaldo, who said upon arriving at Manchester United: \\"If you think I'm good, just wait until you see F√°bio Pa√≠m\\". He joined Sporting CP's youth system at the age of 9, before making his professional debut in 2007 on loan at C.D. Olivais e Moscavide alongside Sporting teammate Bruno Pereirinha; he spent the 2007‚Äì08 season with two teams, making his Primeira Liga debut with F.C. Pa√ßos de Ferreira after starting with C.D. Trofense in the Segunda Liga. In August 2008, Pa√≠m moved on loan to Luiz Felipe Scolari's Chelsea in England, but only appeared for its reserves during a four-month spell. On 11 December he left the club and moved, yet again on loan, to Rio Ave FC. Coach Carlos Brito decided not to keep him mainly due to his high salary, and the player did not manage to attract any interest before the end of winter transfer window, spending the rest of the campaign unattached. On 25 September 2009, both Sporting and Real S.C. ‚Äì which had Filipe Ramos, a former Sporting player, as a coach, with the side competing in the third level ‚Äì agreed to a one-year loan deal until the end of 2009‚Äì10, making Pa√≠m the ninth Sporting player loaned out to that team. In the 2010 off-season, without any official appearances to his credit, 22-year-old Pa√≠m left Sporting for good, signing with another club in division three, S.C.U. Torreense. He left the team after only a couple of months, spending the following years in Angola with C.D. Primeiro de Agosto and S.L. Benfica (Luanda). For the 2012‚Äì13 season, Pa√≠m signed for C.F. Benfica in the Portuguese third division. After some months trying to regain match fitness, he made his official debut against C.D. Mafra; in December 2012, however, he moved teams and countries again, penning a two- year deal with Al Kharaitiyat SC of the Qatar Stars League. On 19 August 2014, Pa√≠m signed a two-year contract for Mosta F.C. in the Maltese Premier League. In April of the following year, he joined FK Nevƒó≈æis in Lithuania. In the summer of 2015, Pa√≠m moved to Union 05 Kayl-T√©tange in Luxembourg's second tier. He was dismissed from the team in September, for \\"unprofessional behavior\\". On 10 November 2017, after a fleeting spell in Brazilian amateur football, Pa√≠m signed with the reserves of Leix√µes S.C. in the Porto Football Association. International career Pa√≠m won 42 caps for Portugal all youth categories comprised, scoring seven goals. Of Angolan descent as his parents hailed from Huambo Province, he was eligible to represent its senior team and hoped to be selected to the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, but ultimately was not called. Pa√≠m's only appearance for the Portuguese under-21s was on 14 October 2008, when he came on as a 69th-minute substitute for Daniel Candeias in a 0‚Äì1 friendly loss to Ukraine held in Vila Nova de Gaia.

Life The old Amsterdam Conservatory concert hall in 1931 at the Bachstraat Dresden was born into a Jewish diamond-broking family and initially studied musical theory with Fred Roeske and composition with Bernard Zweers. On the strength of a promising piano piece, he was sent to study composition and conducting under Hans Pfitzner at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin between 1903-5 and was there encouraged to take an interest in Impressionist music. After returning to the Netherlands, he was until 1914 a choral conductor, as choirmaster at Laren, Amsterdam and Tiel. It was during this period that he married the noted alto Jacoba Dhont, by whom he was to have two sons. Then until 1926 he directed the nine-member Madrigal Society, which earned an international reputation for its painstaking performances of Renaissance, Baroque and contemporary choral music, and afterwards, from 1928 to 1940, a larger chamber choir in Haarlem. To the repertoire of all of these he contributed compositions and arrangements of his own. From 1915 he lectured on musical subjects, both in the Netherlands and in Belgium. In 1918, with Daniel Ruyneman and Henri Zagwijn, he founded the Society of Modern Dutch Composers (which, however, had ceased to exist by 1924). He began teaching composition at the Amsterdam Conservatory in 1919, achieving the post of director in 1924. From 1937-41 he served as director of the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, a post he was forced to leave after the Nazi take-over, and then again from 1945-49. Among his pupils were the composers Leo Smit, Willem van Otterloo, Jan Mul and Cor de Groot and the conductor Eduard van Beinum. After retiring from teaching in 1949, he devoted himself fully to composition and many of his better-known works were composed very late in his life. Dresden also wrote criticism for the newspaper De Telegraaf (1918‚Äì27) and wrote two books on modern music. Shortly before his death he converted to Roman Catholicism. Music The compositions written after Dresden returned from Berlin show largely French influences, as in the four suites for wind and piano composed for the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Sextet (1912‚Äì14) and the Sonata for Flute and Harp (1918). His later music is essentially tonal, but with variations of his own; it also shows the influence of his long involvement with Renaissance polyphony. Through his choral experience he became fascinated with traditional Dutch songs, of which he made many popular arrangements. In addition, he used these tunes to generate themes in original compositions. In the Chorus tragicus (1927), to a text by Vondel concerning the fall of Jerusalem, the Chorus symphonicus (based on Biblical psalms, 1943‚Äì56), the oratorio based on Gustave Flaubert's St Antoine (written for the 1953 international congress of church music in Augsburg), Psalm 84 (1954) and St Joris (1955), Dresden emerged as his country‚Äôs leading twentieth-century composer of oratorios and festive choral music. The Chorus symphonicus, his most monumental composition, was largely written during his internment in World War II. It contrasts with the operetta Toto (1945), written after his liberation, which is about a little dog concealed from the licensing authorities and a humorous representation of his own existence during the Occupation. Dresden‚Äôs last composition was the one-act opera Fran√ßois Villon, that his pupil Jan Mul orchestrated after his death, and the work was first performed during the 1958 Holland Festival.

A film adaptation loosely based on the novel was released in 1997.  Plot  High school senior Julie James receives a note from the mail that reads \\"I know what you did last summer.\\" The previous summer, Julie, her then-boyfriend Ray Bronson, Ray's best friend Barry Cox, and Barry's girlfriend Helen Rivers were driving home after partying in the mountains. They accidentally run over and kill a young bicycling boy named David Gregg. After Ray anonymously calls an ambulance for David, the four make a pact never to tell anyone about their involvement in the incident. Julie and Ray subsequently drift apart from one another, and Ray moves to California for work. Out of guilt, Julie anonymously sends yellow roses to David's funeral. After receiving the note, Julie visits Helen at her apartment. Barry is invited over, and he reassures the girls that it is just a prank and that anyone who knew about their involvement would go to the police instead of leaving notes. Ray returns home after a year away in California and tries to get back together with Julie. However, she is not interested and he learns that she is dating Bud, who recently served in the army. The next day, Helen is tanning at her apartment complex when she meets Collingsworth \\"Collie\\" Wilson, who moved into one of the apartments the day before. After this encounter, Helen finds a magazine cutout of a boy riding a bicycle taped to her apartment door. Ray also receives a newspaper clipping in the mail about David Gregg that same day. On Memorial Day, Barry gets a call from someone offering to sell a picture the caller says shows a car hitting David's bicycle. They agree to meet on the athletic field. When Barry gets there, he is shot in the stomach by an unknown person. The bullet becomes lodged in his spine and threatens to paralyze him. Julie and Ray meet to discuss the shooting and decide to visit the house of David's parents to see if they could have been involved. At the Greggs', Ray and Julie use the excuse of car trouble and Megan, David's sister, lets them in. Ray goes into the hallway and pretends to make a call while Julie talks to Megan. She tells Julie that their mother had a breakdown following David's death and was sent to a hospital in Las Lunas, and their father moved there to be close to her. When Ray and Julie leave, Julie tells Ray what she found out. Ray sneaks into the hospital to visit Barry. Barry lies about the shooting and tells him that someone was trying to rob him, and Ray passes this information along to Helen. When Barry finds out that he will be able to walk, he calls Helen because he wants to confess that the caller was the person who shot him and that she is in danger. Helen is out and misses the call; she is surprised to see Collie when she returns to her apartment. Collie says that he is David's older brother and that he shot Barry as revenge for his involvement in the accident. He explains that he found out who had run him down by questioning the saleswoman from whom Julie had bought the yellow roses. He determined Helen was involved in the hit-and-run when Julie went to Helen's apartment after Julie received the note. Helen realizes that Collie plans to kill her and locks herself in her bathroom. After Collie tries to take the door off its hinges, she breaks the bathroom window and manages to escape. That evening, Julie prepares for her date with Bud. However, her mother has an ominous premonition and asks Julie to stay home, to which she agrees. When Bud arrives, he convinces her to walk him back to his car so that they can have a talk. At his car, Bud tells her that his younger brother David had given him the name Bud because he could not pronounce \\"Collingsworth\\". He reveals that he knows Julie was involved in the hit-and-run and he begins to strangle Julie. Ray, who received a call from Barry warning that they were in danger, appears and beats Collingsworth unconscious with a flashlight. The police arrive after being sent by Helen to Julie's house. Julie and Ray agree that it is time to confess what they did last summer.  Background and publication history  I Know What You Did Last Summer was first published in October 1973 by Little, Brown and Company in hardcover. Duncan got the idea for the book while she was making dinner and her daughter Kerry was having a conversation with a friend in the kitchen. Kerry told her friend about a boy that interested her, and her friend was considering what to wear on her upcoming date. The two eventually found out they were talking about the same boy. Duncan began to wonder what would happen if \\"the boy had deliberately implanted himself in the lives of two girls he knew were friends\\" and if \\"he built up a different personality to present to each of them\\". Duncan later read a story about a hit-and-run in the newspaper, which led her to incorporate one into the novel. On October 5, 2010, Little, Brown reissued the novel in paperback with updates to modernize some of the content. I Know What You Did Last Summer was in the first group of 10 different titles that were updated and reissued with these changes. In the revised edition, Duncan gave her characters cell phones and updated some of her characters' clothing choices. The war Collingsworth had fought in was changed from the Vietnam War to the Iraq War. An audiobook, read by Dennis Holland, was released by Hachette Audio in 2010 and features the modernized text. Lizzie Matkowski from Booklist thought that early on in the audiobook, Holland \\"establishes a sense of normalcy in both the dialogue and narrative, which makes the revelations of what Julie and her friends did and their attempts to go on normally stand out starkly.\\" She stated that the characters are deeply flawed, but that \\"Holland manages to redeem them little by little by emphasizing their naivete, youth, and regret.\\"  Reception  A movie-tie in edition of the novel released by Pocket Books in October 1997 sold 517 thousand copies by November 1998. It was listed by Publishers Weekly as the top selling children's fiction book for the months of October, November and December 1997. A 1999 paperback edition published by Dell was selected as a 2005 Popular Paperback for Young Adults by the American Library Association. A reviewer from Kirkus Reviews felt that Barry and Helen \\"are so vacuous that one hardly cares whether they get murdered or not.\\" They stated that despite this, the \\"madman murderer is cleverly concealed among a bevy of red herrings and as he zeroes in for his revenge this turns into a high velocity chiller with a double identity twist.\\" Jennifer Moody writes in The Times Literary Supplement that \\"the mystery of who is responsible for the letters, the threats and the violence, is handled with skill and panache\\". She added that Duncan \\"makes illuminating contrasts between the relationships of Julie and Ray on the one hand and Helen and Barry on the other.\\" Complete Reviews M. A. Orthofer gave the story a B- rating, stating that the story was a \\"reasonably suspenseful guilt-ridden thriller\\", but that \\"the writing (and some of the plotting) is very, very basic.\\"  Film adaptation  The novel was adapted into a 1997 film of the same name directed by Jim Gillespie and starring Jennifer Love Hewitt as Julie, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Helen, Ryan Phillipe as Barry, and Freddie Prinze Jr. as Ray. Although the film retained the same premise of the novel, the story was re-envisioned as a slasher film with the four friends being hunted by a hook-wielding killer. In addition to featuring the deaths of several characters, unlike the novel, the film depicts the friends as accidentally running over a fisherman who secretly survives the hit-and-run and is ultimately revealed as the killer. Duncan was critical of the adaptation, stating in a 2002 interview she was \\"appalled\\" that her story was turned into a slasher film. The film was met with mixed reviews, but was a commercial success and spawned a film series consisting of a direct sequel in 1998 and a third film in 2006.

Playing career Born in Set√∫bal, Santos made his professional debut with his hometown club Vit√≥ria FC, also serving two loans with lowly teams (Caldas S.C. and CD Oper√°rio). His performances in the 1997‚Äì98 campaign attracted the attention of Leeds United, but he made no official appearances whatsoever for the Premier League side, returning to his country with S.L. Benfica. During his stint in Lisbon, Santos was almost always only third-choice, and went on to also serve several loans, including in Spain's CD Badajoz, playing no games in the second level during his four- month spell. Released by Benfica in June 2004 after a season-long loan spell at Vit√≥ria, he stabilised at C.D. Santa Clara ‚Äì which he had already represented on loan from Benfica ‚Äì starting in two of his three campaigns in the Azores. After one year in North America, appearing for both the Rochester Raging Rhinos and Toronto FC, Santos returned to Portugal and played in slightly more than half of the league's matches for Gondomar SC, with the club, also in division two, being relegated. In the summer, he dropped down to the third tier and joined F.C. Arouca. Coaching career Upon retiring at the age of 39, Santos worked as goalkeeper coach of the Canadian national team. In 2018, in the same capacity, he signed with Lille OSC of the French Ligue 1; in November 2019, still in that role, he moved to English club Tottenham Hotspur.

Early life Ann at 21, sketch by Gilbert Stuart, 1785. She was the eldest daughter of thirteen children born to Anne (n√©e McCall) Willing and Thomas Willing, the first president of the First Bank of the United States. Her paternal grandparents were Charles Willing, who twice served as mayor of Philadelphia, and Anne (n√©e Shippen) Willing (a granddaughter of Edward Shippen, who was the second mayor of Philadelphia). Her uncle, James Willing, was a Philadelphia merchant who later served as a representative of the Continental Congress. Her maternal grandparents were Samuel McCall and Anne (n√©e Searle) McCall. Legacy Correspondence with Thomas Jefferson Lady Liberty. She corresponded, among others, with President Thomas Jefferson. Bingham traveled widely alongside her husband, including to Paris, which was said she particularly loved. Writing to Bingham from Paris in a letter dated February 7, 1787, Jefferson argued that \\"the tranquil pleasures of America [were] preferable to the empty bustle of Paris.\\" \\"In Paris you're consumed with ennui, with no object beyond the present moment,\\" Jefferson wrote. \\"In America, on the other hand, the society of your husband, the fond cares for the children, the arrangements of the house, the improvements of the grounds, fill every moment with a healthy and an useful activity. Every exertion is encouraging, because to present amusement, it joins the promise of some future good.\\" Bingham also argued that women in the U.S. should play an active role in politics, putting women who did so at the time in France as an example. In a 1787 letter back to Jefferson, she wrote, \\"The Women of France interfere in the politics of the Country, and often give a decided Turn to the Fate of Empires...[T]hey have obtained that Rank of Consideration in society, which the Sex are intitled to...[Female Americans] are therefore bound in Gratitude to admire and revere them, for asserting our Privileges.\\" Bingham's letters reportedly led Jefferson to the construct of the United States Bill of Rights. Through many letters, she convinced Jefferson that the Constitution would not last and the individual citizens would have their rights impeded from the interests of the majority. Jefferson was finally convinced and in turn presented her ideas to James Madison (may not have used her name due to the nature of the ideas origin) and Madison agreed to the proposal. Madison then proposed the Individual Bill of Rights and Bingham's ideas were adopted by Congress. Purported model for American coinage Bingham was also the model for multiple portraits by painter Gilbert Stuart. It has been purported that Bingham was therefore the model for Lady Liberty on the American \\"Draped Bust\\" coinage (multiple denominations) during the first decade of the 19th century. Personal life Ann Willing Bingham's tombstone at St. Peter's Church, St. George's, Bermuda. Ann was married to wealthy William Bingham, a United States Senator from Pennsylvania. By the end of the American Revolution, he was regarded as one of the richest men in Pennsylvania, having made his fortune through trading and ownership of privateers. Together, they were the parents of two daughters and a son, including: * Ann Louisa Bingham (b. 1782), who married Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton in 1798. They were the parents of nine children. * Maria Matilda Bingham (1783-1849), who, at the age of 15, was briefly married to a French aristocrat, Jacques Alexandre, Comte de Tilly. Afterwards she married her sister's brother-in-law, Henry Baring. They were the parents of five children. Maria and Henry were divorced in 1824; she married the Marquis de Blaisel in 1826. * William Bingham (1800-1852), who married Marie-Charlotte Chartier de Lotbiniere (1805-1866), Seigneuresse de Rigaud, in 1822. Marie- Charlotte was the second of the three daughters and heiresses of Michel- Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbini√®re, by his second wife Mary, daughter of Capt. John Munro. They lived in Montreal, Paris and London; and were the parents of six children. William Bingham settled in England and died in Kent in 1852. A few weeks after having given birth to her last child, Bingham fell ill of \\"galloping consumption\\" and left for Madeira, but died en route in Bermuda, where she is buried in the Saint Peters Church Graveyard. Her husband continued to Europe and died of a stroke in England in 1804. Notes * The Golden Voyage: The Life and Times of William Bingham, 1762-1804 by Robert C.

It is found in very shallow water in both high and low- salinity habitats. It is a filter feeder and the female broods her eggs in a brood pouch beneath her cephalothorax. Description Neomysis integer is a slender opossum shrimp growing to a maximum length of about . The head has a pair of large, stalked eyes and two pairs of antennae, both of which are biramous (branched into two parts). The exopod (the outermost branch) of the second antenna forms an elongated scale with bristles round its edges and extends forward into a sharp point. The thorax has eight segments each bearing a pair of biramous limbs, the outer branches of which have a feathery appearance. The head and first six segments of the thorax are covered by a protective carapace which extends forward in a triangular plate with a depressed centre between the eyes. The abdomen bears short limbs and the last segment bears larger, flattened biramous limbs which form a tail fan. The telson (the last abdominal segment between the tail fan) is not forked, a fact emphasised by the specific name \\"integer\\". This opossum shrimp is semi- transparent, sometimes with a brownish tinge. Distribution and habitat Neomysis integer is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, its range extending from the Baltic Sea and North Sea to the Mediterranean. It is found just above the seabed in very shallow waters in coastal and estuarine habitats at a wide range of salinities and is able to adapt to changing salinity levels. It is not common in the open sea but is more often observed in high salinity pools on the foreshore and in non-tidal lagoons. It is often the commonest mysid shrimp in the low-salinity upper parts of estuaries. It is also present in lakes in Frisia that were originally linked to the sea but became isolated when the Afsluitdijk causeway was constructed in 1933. Over the succeeding years, the sea water gradually turned to freshwater and Neomysis integer was the only opossum shrimp that survived. Biology These opossum shrimps are frequently found in large numbers and filter small food particles out of the water, occasionally consuming larger prey. The diet consists largely of detritus, but water fleas and copepods are also consumed. Opossum shrimps themselves often fall prey to fish. In the Frisian Lakes these include the European perch (Perca fluviatilis), the European smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), the ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua), young pike-perch (Sander lucioperca) and sometimes the European eel (Anguilla anguilla). The females have a brood pouch under their thorax in which eggs and young develop.

Although the show was designated for children and teenagers, it was also popular with adults. The TV series was split into two parts eight and the eight the next generation Seasons Season 1 Amos Dvir, Avner HaLevy and Roberto, three scientists, investigate cerebral energy called \\"The Lambda Ripples\\". They want to have an experiment that will involve six gifted kids. However, Avner and Amos decide to delay it for a few years. Disappointed, Roberto co-operates with Lillie Dvir, Amos's wife, and the two conduct the experiment on Amos and Lillie's children, three-year-old Maya and Jonathan. The experiment doesn't work and explodes, but the kids stay alive. Roberto goes to jail for six years and Lillie leaves Israel after divorcing Amos. The show fast forwards to seven years later. Amos is dying of cancer, so he decides to grow his children into adolescence ‚Äì to the age of fifteen with his machine Turbo-Time, which can change age, and changes their names to Aya and Nini. Avner raises a project for gifted students and Amos is asking him to attach Aya and Nini to the project. Amos leaves to medical treatments in Switzerland, while Aya and Nini think he's dead. Avner forms \\"The Octette\\" and recruits eight gifted students to investigate the ripples. In addition to solving riddles and saving the countries and themselves from hostile forces, the octette acts like a typical class with loves and friendships. Surprisingly, Lillie comes back from abroad to raise her children. At the same time, she and Roberto co-operate and follow the project to avenge Amos and Avner. A substitute teacher named Dedi joins the school and begins a relationship with Dganit, the class teacher. At the same time Lillie gains control of the project and is ready to use the octette like batteries and pump the lambda energy from them. Lillie threatens the octette, almost kills Adam and Dganit, goes to jail and disappoints her two children. Aya and Nini are shocked to find out that their father is alive, and he is a person that they have known so far as their history teacher ‚Äì Dedi. In spite of the project's success, Avner and Dganit decide to end it because of the risk to the students and a possible public exposure of the project. The students are scattered in couples in the school's classes. Dganit and her son Ben-Ben move to Dedi, Nini and Aya's house. The season ends when Nini returns to be Jonathan. Season 2 The second season opens at the superior court, where Dedi and Avner stand trial for illegally using children. They are on the verge of insanity, but the testimony of Yair Noam, the Prime Minister (who had headed the project as the education minister) leads to their acquittal. Dedi, Dganit and Avner start a new project, this time with state approval. The Prime Minister sets up an elaborate watch tower at the top of the Azrieli Towers, where they can work undisturbed. The ostensible reason is solving some of the country's problems, but in fact, the state is trying to use their lambda energy. The project is well funded by the Prime Minister and his assistant, Muli Noam. Nini decides to be 15 again and Aya visits Lillie in jail and follows her to Patmos, her asylum. The plane to Patmos crashes and it is assumed that Aya has died in the crash, although no corpse is found. At the same time, Dganit meets an orphaned girl named Nitzan and adopts her. Nitzan sleeps in Aya's room and starts to spend time with the group. At first, she's dating Dori, but finally she's dating Adam, after he reconciles himself with Aya's death. Avner recognizes lambda ripples in Nitzan too and she joins the project, instead of Aya. At the same time, the viewer is shown that Aya is not dead, but in a desert in the middle of nowhere. Aya discovers that she had been kidnapped by Muli Noam, and confronts him. Muli is a member of a sect named \\"Scorpio\\", a destructive sect that wants to spread their ideas using the lambda ripples and seeks to dominate the world. The sect tries to pump Aya's energy and even threatens to hurt Adam's sister, Rotem. Later, they kidnap Dedi. At the same time, Daniel Harris, a 19-year-old millionaire, enters Natascha and Roni's life. He dates Roni and taking Natascha as an apprentice artist under his patronage. However, he is a member of Scorpio. Just before the season ends, it is revealed that Lillie is also a member of the sect. She saves her ex-husband and daughter, Dedi and Aya, but goes to jail again. The sect members kidnap the octette and bring them into the temple where Aya, Dedi and Lillie are held. Dedi shoots Muli and all the sect members are arrested by the police, except Daniel, who escapes. The octette members, and especially Adam, are shocked to see Aya alive. Aya comes back home, but she is broken- hearted and feels uncomfortable around her friends. Nitzan moves to Roni's house, instead of Roni's sister, Elli, who is flies to London as an MTV emissary. Dganit tells Dedi that she is pregnant, and they get married. Season 3 The third season starts in Mika's aunt's villa during the summer holidays. After a strange guest comes to the villa, everyone in the octette, except Aya, joins the police's secret organization called \\"The Council\\". Aya prefers to spend her summer holidays helping pregnant Dganit and reading books. The octette introduces itself to Alex, Lillie's sister and the head of \\"The Council\\", and the three procurators, Yoel, Dafi (the strange guest), and Omri. At the same time, Avi, who becomes the leader of the octette, breaks up with Mika and moves into Chekhov's place. Chekhov is an old friend and also a member of \\"The Council\\". Avi doesn't know that he was chosen to be commander because of his relationship with Chekhov. Roni and Nini get back together, and Nitzan and Adam maintain their relationship, although Adam still has feelings for Aya. At the same time Dganit's doctor, Julius Calderon, arouses suspicion in Aya, and it is exposed that he was the doctor of all the octette members' mothers, when they were pregnant. Julius combines Daniel Harris and Lina, who has escaped jail, and together they try to get the Crypton gene, the gene that makes a human with lambda ripples‚Äîa physically perfect human. Season 4 and 5 The fourth season (unofficially known as HaShminiya: The Next Generation) starts seven years after the end of Season 3. After receiving a mail from Avner HaLevy, saying that their memory was wiped. He also tells that he couldn't wipe the memory of his own son, Adam, and that he lived all-alone until he died, though it is suspected that he was murdered. He tells the remain seven - Natascha, Roni, Dori, Nini, Aya, Mika and Avi - that they have a mission - they have to find and train all-new six teenagers - Raphael, Hagar, Yotam, Gilli, Dennis and Leia. Tamar and Yaron Dvir, Aya and Nini's siblings, are seven years old, and are home-schooled by tablets and LSRs - and Avshalom, the new villain, using their lamda for his new corporation - \\"Good Thoughts cop\\". This corporation has very few workers - and apparently, Nitzan is one of them. The fourth season was split into two parts: Season 4 (24 episodes) and Season 5 (23 episodes).

The film then shifts to the story of \\"The Girl\\" and \\"The Boy,\\" she an aspiring actress and he an unpublished playwright. They are both humble artists struggling to make it big, and each are behind in their rent at a boarding house run by a stern landlady and a large, thuggish \\"bouncer.\\" Having romantic feelings for the girl, the boy gives her all of his money so she can pay the back rent.

While searching for the girl inside the club, the boy accidentally starts winning at roulette when he unwittingly places some found money on the table. Just as he bankrupts the casino, the place is raided by the police. After a series of chases and clever maneuvers, the boy is able to evade the police and is reunited with the girl. The film ends with the two engaged in a romantic kiss.

And even though Path√© was eager to release his first two-reel comedy featuring the \\"glasses\\" character, the company wanted to release all of the remaining one-reelers first. When the film was finally released in November 1919, it was met with great fanfare, partially due to the recent publicity surrounding its star after a prop bomb exploded during a photo shoot, damaging his eyes and severing his right thumb and forefinger. Miraculously, Lloyd managed to fully regain his eyesight and was able to attend the premiere of Bumping Into Broadway in New York City. In the end, the picture not only received great reviews, it broke several house records in theaters across the country, solidifying Lloyd's place as a top-billing comedy star.

The widow of former Governor Tom McCall, she became one of the most politically influential first ladies and former first ladies in Oregon's history. Following her husband's death in 1983, Audrey McCall championed a variety of political, social and environmental issues throughout the state. In particular, McCall sought to protect and expand the sweeping statewide land-use laws that had been implemented and signed into law by Governor McCall. She campaigned and fundraised on behalf of both Democratic and Republican political candidates. In 2017, Audrey McCall Beach, downtown Portland's newly constructed urban beach along the Willamette River, was named in honor of the former first lady. Biography McCall was born Audrey Grace Owen in Spokane, Washington, on February 26, 1915. Her mother sold real estate, while her father worked as a wholesaler grocer. Owen initially enrolled as a student at Washington State University, but left school to take a job offer as a home economist for Washington Water Power, based in Moscow, Idaho. Part of her new job required her to conduct cooking demonstrations and classes utilizing modern electric stoves. Owen was holding one of those classes when she met Tom McCall, a local reporter for the News-Review who had been assigned to pen a story for his newspaper. In a later interview with The Oregonian during the 1970s, McCall recalled her first meeting with him, telling the reporter \\"He was a very hungry reporter,\\" who ate her food following the cooking demo, \\"That's how we became acquainted.\\" The couple dated for three months before marrying on May 20, 1939, just one day after she accepted his marriage proposal. The small ceremony was held in Moscow with just two friends in attendance. The couple had two sons, Sam McCall and Thomas \\"Tad\\" McCall Jr., an environmental consultant. McCall served as the First Lady of Oregon from 1967 until 1975 during the administration of her husband. Led by Governor McCall, a Republican, Oregon became known for its innovative environmental and social policies during their two terms in office. Audrey McCall supported many of these policies during her tenure as first lady and after leaving the governor's mansion. Separate from the Governor, First Lady McCall became an influential figure within Oregon politics in her own right. She was also considered one of her husband's closest political advisers behind-the-scenes, while projecting a more traditional public image as a homemaker and first lady. Following former Governor McCall's death in 1983, Audrey McCall sought to preserve his political legacy. In particular, McCall used her influence and fundraising expertise to protect Oregon's landmark, statewide land-use laws, which Governor McCall had spearheaded and signed into law. During the early 2000s, Audrey McCall joined with other individuals in a lawsuit to stop Ballot Measure 7, a 2000 property-rights ballot measure that would have weakened the land-use laws introduced by Governor McCall in the 1970s. The courts eventually ruled in McCall's favor and the ballot initiative was defeated. She actively campaigned for and against several other ballot initiatives as well. She also campaigned on behalf of a variety of other causes, and supported a bipartisan slate of candidates from both parties who supported these initiatives. McCall also intervened during a dispute over the proposed location as a proposed memorial statue for Governor Tom McCall; both Portland and Salem, Oregon, wanted the statue to be placed in their cities. Audrey McCall agreed that the statue should be placed in Salem, the state capital, since that is where much of her husband's major initiatives were conceived. The statue now stands in Salem's Riverfront Park along the Willamette River. Audrey McCall remained active and in good health until she broke her hip in a fall in mid-August 2007. Shortly after her fall, she moved to a nursing home facility in Southwest Portland, Oregon, where she died on November 15, 2007, at the age of 92. She was survived by one of her two sons, Tad McCall, her sister, Phyllis Royer, and two grandchildren. She was buried in Redmond, Oregon, next to her husband and son, Sam McCall, on November 24, 2007. On October 13, 2017, the city of Portland and Mayor Ted Wheeler opened a new urban beach along the Willamette River in downtown Portland. The new beach was dedicated \\"Audrey McCall Beach\\" in the former first lady's honor. The Audrey McCall Beach, only the second urban beach to be acknowledged along the Willamette River, took four years to build. An estimated 19 tons of concrete was removed by Human Access Project in that time from the east side of the Portland waterfront to construct the new beach and access point to the river. The concrete removal was done without heavy mechanized equipment by Human Access Volunteers and collaboration with Multnomah County Inverness Jail Inmate workforce program Human Access Project successfully advocated with Portland Mayor Charlie Hales to find $300,000 to study the feasibility of a beach at this site.

In late 1983, she began appearing on Page 3 of The Sun and in British men's magazines. As a consequence, she was expelled from King Henry VIII School, Coventry, before she completed her O-levels. She went on to model for numerous other publications and also starred in a number of softcore videos. She retired from glamour modelling in 1996. Ashby subsequently expressed regret over her glamour modelling career. She noted that she suffered from bulimia for around seven years, that men frequently preyed sexually on young glamour models, and that she underwent therapy for four years. She supported the decision to remove Page 3 from The Sun, stating that if she had a daughter, she would not want her to become a glamour model. In 2018, aged 50, Ashby featured in a charity glamour pictorial in The Sun, appearing alongside other former Page 3 models to raise funds for a fellow former model's cancer treatment. She and the other models were photographed covering their breasts with their hands. Personal life Ashby had a controversial and widely publicised relationship with American actor Tony Curtis when she was 17 and he was 59, during which she spent time at his Palm Springs home.

This was the first film Lloyd made with frequent co-star (and future wife) Mildred Davis. A print of the film survives in the film archive of the British Film Institute. Plot A young woman stands to inherit a fortune, but a crooked lawyer deliberately does not tell her she must prove her claim before midnight. If she fails, the inheritance will go to her foster brother. As further insurance, the lawyer hires a man and his gang to kidnap her. Meanwhile, a penniless young man and an unrelated child (the waif) are both hungry. The waif's dog brings them some money (taken from a crap game), so they purchase some food. When the money turns out to be counterfeit, the man tries to flee, but is finally caught by a policeman. The heiress happens to be driving by. She generously pays for the food, and the young man is allowed to go his way. Later, he gets into trouble with the police again, this time over a wallet filled with money lying on the sidewalk. To escape, he hitches a ride on a passing car, which is carrying the kidnappers. The crooks decide to use the man as a scapegoat in their crime. They capture the woman (who thinks the man is a kidnapper too) and take her to their lair. Unable to stop them, he follows them to their hideout and overhears the lawyer explaining the situation. The man then tries to alert several policemen, but they just brush him off. He finally provokes them into chasing him and leads them to the crooks. During the ensuing melee, he and the woman get away. He takes her to the lawyer's office just in time to sign a document and secure her inheritance.

Early years Lee Allen was born in Muscatine, Iowa, then moved to Des Moines, where he graduated from East High School in 1928. He studied briefly with Iowa artist Charles Atherton Cumming at the Cumming School of Art, housed then on the upper floor of the Des Moines Public Library. In 1880, Cumming had launched the art department at Cornell College (Mount Vernon, Iowa) and, in 1909, had become the founding head of the art department at the University of Iowa (Iowa City), a position he continued to hold while also teaching in Des Moines. Encouraged by Cumming most likely, Allen enrolled in the School of Art at the University of Iowa in 1929. In 1932 and 1933 Allen was a student at the Stone City Art Colony and studied under Grant Wood. Murals Iowa artist Grant Wood became internationally known in 1930, with the completion of his painting called American Gothic, and in 1934, he was invited to join the faculty at the University of Iowa. Wood also served as the Iowa director for the Public Works of Art Project, in connection with which he called on Allen to assist him with various projects. Afterwards, in 1935, Allen went to Mexico, where he studied mural painting with Diego Rivera, to whom he had been introduced by Grant Wood. When he returned to Iowa, he received two additional government commissions from the Section of Fine Arts of the U.S. Treasury Department to make indoor murals for new post offices in two small Iowa communities. In 1938, Allen created a mural titled ‚ÄúSoil Erosion and Control‚Äù for the post office in Onawa, Iowa. In 1940, he produced a second mural called ‚ÄúConservation of Wild Life‚Äù for the post office in Emmetsburg, Iowa. Medical illustration In 1937, while looking for full- time employment, Allen accepted an appointment at the College of Medicine at the University of Iowa as a medical illustrator. He remained in that position for 39 years, during which he also published various scholarly papers about medical illustration as applied to ophthalmology.

Macular degeneration Around 1988, while in retirement, Allen began to experience symptoms of macular degeneration, an incurable dysfunction that had resulted in functional blindness for millions of senior citizens. In response, he made a series of diary-like drawings of the progression of his illness and its treatment with laser surgery. In 2000, at age 90, he produced a book about his twelve-year introspective watch of macular degeneration, titled The Hole in My Vision: An Artist‚Äôs View of His Own Macular Degeneration. The book contains his drawings of the changes in his vision, his annotations, with other observations by his medical colleagues and physicians.Lee Allen, James C. Folk and H. Stanley Thompson.

Life Hanna Resvoll-Holmsen suffered much from illness in her childhood and school attention after her 12th year was sporadic. She took a high school exam in 1902, at which time she had also an unhappy marriage behind her. She studied natural history at the Royal Frederik's University in Kristiania and graduated in botany in 1910. From 1921, she was docent in plant geography at the same university, a position she held until her retirement in 1938. Hanna Resvoll-Holmsen participated as a botanist in the Svalbard expedition in 1907 led by the oceanographer Prince Albert. The next year she went to Svalbard alone mainly to take photographs, partly in colour. These photographs constitute a unique early documentation of Svalbard‚Äôs nature. Her botanical observations were first published as Observations botaniques in Monaco, later in Norwegian as Svalbards Flora (1927) ‚Äì the first flora of this archipelago. Using Christen C. Raunki√¶r‚Äôs quantitative methods,Shimwell, D.W. (1971) The Description and Classification of Vegetation. Sidgwick & Jackson, London. she made a large vegetation survey of Norwegian alpine vegetation, published as Om Fjeldvegetationen i det √òstenfjeldske Norge (On the mountain vegetation in Norway east of the Scandes; 1920). She was particularly interested in the subalpine birch forests. She published an essay Om betydningen av det uensartede i v√•re skoger (On the significance of heterogeneity in forests), which made plead for the conservation of natural mountain forest and criticized its replacement by spruce plantations. This pamphlet caused much animosity against her among foresters. Together with the geologist Adolf Hoel, she was behind the first designation of a conservation area in Svalbard. She was a strong advocate for nature conservation in the Norwegian mountains. She is known in Norwegian conservation circles as the country's first green stocking. Resvoll-Holmsen was first married to Hans Dieset (divorced 1901), then from 1909 to state geologist Gunnar Holmsen (1880‚Äì1976), brother of her sister's husband. The buttercup species Ranunculus resvoll-holmseniae (Ranunculaceae) has been named to her honour.

Some common symptoms for aggressive lymphoma are weight loss, night sweats, nausea and recurrent fevers. Since these tumors are fast to grow and spread, immediate intervention is required after diagnosis. There are several subtypes of aggressive lymphoma. These include AIDS- associated lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common subtype as well as the most common type of Non- Hodgkin Lymphoma. Aggressive lymphoma accounts for approximately 60 percent of all Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma cases in the United States.  Risk factors  Some of the risk factors that increase the risk factor of aggressive lymphoma include: *Immunosuppressive medication used for organ transplant patients or autoimmune diseases. * Infection with certain viruses and bacteria such as HIV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). * Exposure to chemicals such as insecticides and pesticides. * Older age.  Symptoms & Diagnosis  The symptoms of aggressive lymphoma are similar to that of low-grade lymphomas. Patients may come in with painless swollen lymph nodes in their neck, armpits or groin. They can also describe symptoms such as abdominal pain, chest pain, persistent fatigue, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss depending on the stage of their tumor and its location. Since the signs and symptoms of aggressive lymphoma are similar to that of other types of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma it is important analyze the tumors morphologically and run immunohistochemical tests to ensure correct diagnosis. For aggressive lymphoma, swift and specific treatment dependent upon correct diagnosis can be the difference between life and death for the patient.  Types  The most common types of high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma are:  Diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)  Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of high-grade NHL which is the most common type of NHL worldwide at affecting 30-40 percent of all NHL cases. It is more prevalent in elderly patients with a median age of 70 years. Patients most often present with a rapidly growing tumor mass in single or multiple, nodal or extranodal sites. The most commonly diagnosed versions of DLBCL are germinal center B-cell like (GCB) and activated B-cell like (ABC) subtypes. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometry analysis is also necessary for the diagnosis of this disease. The DLBCL cells have found to express B-cell antigens such as CD19, CD20, and CD22 as well as the transcription factors PAX5, BOB.1, and OCT2. CD20 is especially relevant in diagnostics as well as therapeutics because it is the target of the Rituximab humanized monoclonal antibody that is used in the most common treatment strategy. In addition to this, the majority of cells also express surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulins, specifically IgM, IgG and IgA. While these analyses allow for diagnosis by displaying proof of B-cell lineage, they can also be used in treatment strategy and can give insight into prognosis of the specific case being considered. Burkitt Lymphoma  Burkitt Lymphoma  Burkitt lymphoma is named after the British surgeon Denis Burkitt. Dr.Burkitt identified this disease in 1956 in children in Africa. In Africa, Burkitt lymphoma is common in children also infected by malaria and Epstein-Barr virus. Outside of Africa, Burkitt lymphoma is less common. In the U.S., about 1,200 people are diagnosed each year, and the disease disproportionately affects those younger than the age of 40. Burkitt lymphoma is especially likely to develop in people infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Before highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) became a widespread treatment for HIV/AIDS, the incidence of Burkitt lymphoma was estimated to be 1,000 times higher in HIV- positive people than in the general population.  Peripheral T-cell lymphoma  Peripheral T-cell lymphomas are less common accounting for approximately 7% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. It represents a diverse group of diseases that lacks clear definition. These diseases may involve extranodal sites such as the liver, bone, marrow, intestinal tract and the skin. Due to its difficulties in classification, diagnosis and treatment is often regarded as \\"orphan diseases\\".  Rarer types of high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma  *AIDS-associated lymphoma * Angioimmunoblastic lymphoma * Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma * Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)  Treatment  For limited high grade lymphoma the typical treatment is chemotherapy and a targeted drug, followed by radiotherapy. While advanced high grade aggressive lymphoma patients receive similar treatments, the duration is extended. For advanced diffuse large B cell lymphoma the standard therapy for patients with DLBCL is the combination use of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). While this commonly used regimen results in 60-70 percent of patients with DLBCL to be cured of disease there is also a group of patients that relapse and do not respond well to R-CHOP. For these patients the current treatment strategies are insufficient in treating their cancer. In addition to this, alternative treatments continue to be research due to the highly toxic nature of R-CHOP. In contrast to mature B-cell neoplasms, therapeutic advances in peripheral T-cell lymphoma have generally lagged behind, particularly with regard to the introduction of immune therapies, which have impacted significantly and favorably on the prognosis of aggressive B cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. As such, it remains a heterogeneous entity with a generally unfavorable prognosis.  Prognosis  While there is no way of definitively predicting the outcome of an individual‚Äôs diagnosis of aggressive lymphoma, there are ways of best guessing the prognosis of the patient. These prognostic factors can be divided into three categories. The first category depends on the patient and can be their age and overall health. The second category is dependent upon the tumor and includes the stage, tumor burden, and extranodal involvement. Finally, the last category is dependent on aggressiveness indicators. Factors such as LDH serum level and proliferative fraction can give insight into the tumor microenvironment and proliferation potential which may impact the prognosis.  Research  Two promising immunotherapy approaches against diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy and therapeutic blocking of programmed cell death protein 1 pathway (PD-1/PD-L1). While CAR T-cells have shown promising efficacy in patients with DLBCL, there have been some unexpected toxicity related issues that have come up for further research. One proposal to improve research for treatment in aggressive lymphoma is to use canines as model animals. Canine lymphoma prevalence has been increasing over the years similar to the incidence of human lymphoma cases. Lymphoma represents the most frequent hematopoietic cancer in dogs with canine non-Hodgkin lymphoma (cNHL) having the highest incidence at 83% of all hematopoietic cancers. In addition to this diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most commonly seen subtype of NHL in both species. The advantages of using canines as model animals include spontaneous disease occurring without an isogenic background or genetic engineering; chronology of disease adapted to lifespan; shared environmental and societal status that allows dogs to be treated as ‚Äúpatients‚Äù, while at the same time being able to ethically explore translational innovations that are not possible in human subjects; and organization of dogs into breeds with relatively homogeneous genetic backgrounds and distinct predisposition for lymphomas. In addition to this, there have also been studies that suggest that breed type might influence disease progression and response to therapy which is very promising for human therapeutic research.

It utilizes in part the TNM scoring system: Tumor size, Lymph Nodes affected, Metastases. AJCC and TNM are in fact the same.  Cancer staging  Cancers are classified at different stages depending on how advanced tumours have progressed. Staging describes the extent or severity of an individual's cancer based on the extent of the original (primary) tumor and the extent of spread in the body. Knowing the state of the disease helps the doctor plan a treatment and determine a prognosis (likely outcome or course of the disease). Staging provides a common language with which doctors can communicate about a patient's case. Knowing the stage is important in identifying clinical trials that may be suitable for a particular patient. Common elements of staging systems Staging is based on knowledge of the way cancer develops. Some staging systems cover many types of cancer; others focus on a particular type. For most cancers, the stage is based on three main factors: * Location of the primary (original) tumor * Tumor size and number of tumors * Lymph node involvement (whether or not the cancer has spread to the nearby lymph nodes) * Presence or absence of metastasis (whether or not the cancer has spread to distant areas of the body) Cancers of the brain and spinal cord are classified according to cell type and grade. Different staging systems are used for many cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as lymphoma. Staging process Doctors gather different types of information about a cancer to determine its stage. The various tests used for staging depend on the type of cancer. Tests include the following: * Physical exams provide clues as to the extent of the cancer. The physical exam may determine the location and size of the tumor(s) and the spread of the cancer to the lymph nodes and/or to other organs. * Imaging tests such as x-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans produce pictures of areas inside the body and can show the location of the cancer, the size of the tumor, and whether the cancer has spread. These studies are important in determining stage. * Laboratory tests are studies of blood, urine, other fluids and tissues removed from the body. These tests can also provide information about the cancer. * Pathology reports may include information about the size of the tumor, the growth into other tissues and organs, the type of cancer cells, and the grade of tumor (how closely the cancer cells resemble normal tissue). Removing tumors or pieces of tumors and looking at them under the microscope often confirms the diagnosis of cancer, and can also stage the cancer. * Surgical reports tell what is found during surgery. Samples are removed during surgery to determine the size and appearance of the tumor and often include observations about lymph node and organ involvement. Different types of staging There are three different types of staging: * Clinical Staging determines how much cancer there is based on the physical examination, imaging tests, and biopsies of affected areas. * Pathologic Staging can only be done on patients who have had surgery to remove or explore the extent of the cancer. This type of staging combines the results of both the clinical staging (physical exam, imaging test) with the results from the surgery. * Restaging is used to determine the extent of the disease if a cancer comes back after treatment. This is done to determine what the best treatment option would be at the time. This type of staging is not common.  TNM Staging System  The TNM Staging System is one of the most commonly used staging systems. This system was developed and is maintained by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and adopted by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). The TNM classification system was developed as a tool for doctors to stage different types of cancer based on certain standard criteria. The TNM Staging System is based on the extent of the tumor (T), the extent of spread to the lymph nodes (N), and the presence of metastasis (M). The T category describes the original (primary) tumor. TX - Primary tumor cannot be evaluated T0 - No evidence of primary tumor Tis - Carcinoma in situ (early cancer that has not spread to neighboring tissue) T1‚ÄìT4 - Size and/or extent of the primary tumor The N category describes whether or not the cancer has reached nearby lymph nodes. NX - Regional lymph nodes cannot be evaluated NO - No regional lymph node involvement (no cancer found in the lymph nodes) N1-N3 - Involvement of regional lymph nodes (number and/or extent of spread) The M category tells whether there are distant metastases (spread of cancer to other parts of the body). MO - No distant metastasis (cancer has not spread to other parts of the body) M1 - Distant metastasis (cancer has spread to distant parts of the body) Each cancer type has its own classification system, so letters and numbers do not always mean the same thing for every kind of cancer. Once the T, N, and M are determined, they are combined, and an overall \\"Stage\\" of I, II, III, IV is assigned. Sometimes these stages are subdivided as well, using letters such as IIIA and IIIB. Stage I cancers are the least advanced and often have a better prognosis (outlook for survival). Higher stage cancers are often more advanced, but in many cases can still be treated successfully. Changes in cancer stage The formal \\"stage\\" of a cancer does not change over time, even if the cancer progresses. A cancer that returns or spreads is still referred to by the stage it was given when it first diagnosed. Sometimes, after a period of remission (cancer being undetectable) for certain cancers, if more treatment is planned, a doctor might restage the cancer. The same process that was done when the cancer was first diagnosed will be repeated: exams, imaging tests, biopsies, and possibly surgery to restage the cancer. If the cancer is restaged, the new stage will be recorded with a lower case \\"r\\" before the restaged designation. As previously stated, this is not done often.

An allergic response is a hypersensitive immune reaction to a substance that normally is harmless or would not cause an immune response in everyone. An allergic response may cause harmful symptoms such as itching or inflammation or tissue injury. Mechanism Allergies are an abnormal immune reaction. The human immune system is designed to protect the body from potential harm and in people who have allergies the immune system will react to allergens (substances that trigger an immune response). The immune system will produce immunoglobulin E, IgE, antibodies for each allergen. The antibodies will cause cells in the body to produce histamines. These histamines will act on different areas of the body (eyes, throat, nose, gastrointestinal tract, skin or lungs) to produce symptoms of an allergic reaction. The allergic response is not limited to a certain amount of exposure. If the body is exposed to the allergen multiple times the immune system will react every time the allergen is present. The reason why people get allergies is not known. The allergens are not passed down through generations. It is believed if parents have allergies the child is more likely to be allergic to the same allergens. Some common symptoms include itchiness, swelling, running nose, watery eyes, coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, hives, rashes, mucus production, or a more severe reaction anaphylaxis. Allergic responses and the severity vary from person to person. Many substances can trigger an allergic reaction. Common triggers of a reaction include foods, likes nuts, eggs, milk, gluten, fruit and vegetables; insect bites from bees or wasps (often a severe response occurs); environmental factors such as pollen, dust, mold, plants like grass or trees, animal dander; medications or chemicals. Some people experience an allergic response to cold or hot temperatures outside, jewelry or sunlight. There are daily treatments to reduce the severity of the allergic response. Often these treatments include an antihistamine oral pill, nasal spray, or eye drops. Other treatments include an allergy shot, which keep the allergic response to a minimum. For more severe reactions an epinephrine injection is carried around. This injection will be taken if the person is going into anaphylactic shock. The best treatment is avoidance of each allergen.

It contains about 70% of the species of the family. It is made of several tribes, including Astereae, Calenduleae, Eupatorieae, Gnaphalieae, Heliantheae, Senecioneae and Tageteae. Asteroideae contains plants found all over the world, many of which are shrubby. There are about 1,135 genera and 17,200 species within this subfamily; the largest genera by number of species are Helichrysum (500-600) and Artemisia (550). Asteroideae is said to have begun approximately 46-36.5 million years ago. Tribes This subfamily is composed of 21 tribes that are broken into 3 supertribes: Senecionodae, Asterodae, and Helianthodae. Senecioneae contains about 120 genera and more than 3200 species that are found in more temperate areas. Asterodae contains many economically important plants such as the chrysanthemums, common daisy, and the asters. The third super tribe is the Helianthodae, which is the largest of the three, containing 16 of the 21 tribes. Common characteristics This family will often have radiate style heads but some could have discoid or disciform. They contain ray florets that are three lobed and are also considered perfect flower implying that it is bisexual. Many contain stigmatic surfaces that are separated by two marginal bands and terminal sterile appendages with sweeping hairs. Uses The subfamily Asteroideae has many genera within the tribes that have economic uses. The Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem artichoke), Helianthus annuus (sunflower), Guizotia abyssinica (niger seed) are all used as oil seed crops. Artemisia dracunculus (tarragon) is used for culinary herb and Parthenium argentatum (guayule) is a rubber source. Some of the other genera are used as ornamentals; those are Dendranthema spp. (chrysanthemum), Callistephus, Cosmos, Tagetes (marigold), and many others.

It marked the final colloboration with frequent co-star Snub Pollard, who moved on to star in his own series of films following this release. This film was remade in 1927 as Long Fliv the King which featured Oliver Hardy. Plot The Prince of Razzmatazz (Gaylord Lloyd) is in America being educated. He receives a telegram telling him to travel to the Kingdom of Thermosa to vie with a drunken rival, the Prince of Roquefort (Snub Pollard), to marry \\"the fairest bud in the kingdom\\": Princess Florelle. The Prince of Razzmatazz is unhappy about this development because he would prefer to marry his female tutor. When the tutor sees that an American boy (Harold Lloyd) bears a striking resemblance to the prince, she convinces the American boy to take the Prince's place. His body guard accepts a large bribe to go along with the plan. Immediately after the American boy leaves, the prince informs his tutor that since he can no longer be a prince, he is cut off from all royal funds. The tutor quickly turns in him and throws him out of her home. Upon arriving in Thermosa, the American boy has to escape a violent anti-monarchist mob. Once he gets to the palace, he has second thoughts about replacing the Prince, but he changes his mind when he sees several pretty ladies-in-waiting and Princess Florelle. Florelle eventually chooses the American boy over the Prince of Roquefort. Shortly afterward, the real prince arrives and exposes the American boy as a fraud. The boy is thrown out onto the street just as the agitated anti-monarchist mob is attacking the royal palace. The American boy accidentally fires a cannon into the palace--winning himself the new job as the country's president as the monarchy topples. As president, he rushes back to inside the palace to rescue Florelle and her parents from the mob using his presidential powers.

Often, amelanotic melanomas are mistaken for benign lesions, including dermatitis, benign neoplastic processes, or a different malignancy such as basal-cell carcinoma or squamous-cell carcinoma. A poor prognosis is associated with amelanotic lesions, partially due to the difficulty in achieving a diagnosis; however, metastatic amelanotic melanoma has a worse prognosis than other subtypes. Survival after diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma was found in a 2014 seven-year study of 3,000 patients to be poorer than for pigmented melanoma, which was attributed to the more advanced stage at diagnosis due probably to difficulty of diagnosis.

His Cherokee name was Unaduti.Foreman, Carolyn Ross. \\"Aunt Eliza of Tahlequah.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 9, No. 1 (March, 1931). Retrieved June 19, 2013. As a young man, he was ordained a Baptist minister. A member of the John Ross faction of the Cherokee, he was dispatched by Ross in 1837 on a mission to the Seminole. Although Bushyhead opposed the federal policy forcing Indian Removal to west of the Mississippi River, he accepted the inevitable and led a party of about 1,000 people on the Trail of Tears. On his arrival in 1839 near present-day Westville, Oklahoma, he established the Baptist Mission. This marked the end of the Cherokee Trail of Tears. He became chief justice of the Cherokee nation in 1840 and remained in that office until his death. His eldest son, Dennis Bushyhead, held several offices in the Cherokee Nation, including as Principal Chief. He served from 1879 to 1887. Early life Jesse Bushyhead was born in September 1804 to a half-blood Cherokee woman named Nancy Foreman in a Cherokee settlement near the present city of Cleveland, Tennessee. His father was also of mixed-race Cherokee ancestry, John Bushyhead Stuart. He was educated at Candy's Creek Mission, and taught at several schools for boys in the Candy's Creek area.Routh, E. C. \\"Early Missionaries to the Cherokees.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 15, No. 4. Retrieved July 20, 2013. Career as a missionary Bushyhead was baptized as a Christian and became an avid member of the Baptist church in 1830. He began converting other Cherokee to Christianity, established a church at Amohee in Tennessee (then his home town), and became a close associate of noted Baptist missionary, Reverend Evan Jones. Jones preached in English, while Bushyhead translated the sermon into Cherokee. One writer claimed that Bushyhead was, \\"... the best interpreter in the nation.\\" In 1832, Reverend Jones recommended to the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions that Bushyhead be appointed as an assistant missionary. The appointment was made, and Bushyhead served in this role for the next eleven years. He is said to have been the first Cherokee to have been ordained as a Baptist minister. He continued to work closely with Jones, not only preaching to the Cherokees, but translating the Book of Genesis and other religious books into the Cherokee language, using the Cherokee Syllabary. He also served as pastor of the Amohee church.Hirschfelder, Arlene, and Paulette Molin. \\"Bushyhead, Jesse.\\" Encyclopedia of Native American Religions, Updated Edition. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2000. American Indian History Online. Facts On File, Inc. Family life Jesse Bushyhead married Eliza Wilkerson, who bore nine children. Jane was his oldest daughter and his oldest son, Dennis Bushyhead, was notable for serving as Principal Chief for two terms, from 1879 to 1887. His home in Cleveland was on Mouse Creek near the present- day Cleveland High School. Removal to Indian Territory Jesse Bushyhead had opposed removal of the Cherokees from their homeland in the Southeast. As the deadline approached when General Winfield Scott and the U.S. Army would escort the people to a new homeland in the Indian Territory, Rev. Bushyhead volunteered to lead one of the groups of emigres. The group who followed him was from a part of the nation where there was no capable leader. The group led by Bushyhead followed the same northern route taken by the group led by Evan Jones. The route led them north through Tennessee and Kentucky to an Ohio River crossing at Golconda, Illinois, then west to cross the Mississippi River near Cape Girardeau, Missouri. After that, they turned southwest to Indian Territory. At the start of the trek, the group numbered 950 people. During the journey, the group experienced 8 deaths and 6 births, including that of one of his daughters, Eliza Missouri Bushyhead, so that 898 arrived safely at their destination on February 23, 1838. The trek terminated at a place Bushyhead called Pleasant Hill, about north of the present day town of Westville, Oklahoma and about from Fort Smith, Arkansas. The Cherokees called the place \\"Breadtown\\" because food rations were distributed there. Later, they named the place \\"Baptist Mission.\\" Death and burial  Jesse Bushyhead died on July 17, 1844 after a brief, but unspecified illness. He was buried at the old Baptist Mission cemetery near Westville Jesse Bushyhead's grave at the Baptist Mission Cemetery is marked by a marble monument. His grave is the only surviving property associated with his life, and as such is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Adair County, Oklahoma. One side of the monument reads: \\"Sacred to the memory of Rev. Jesse Bushyhead, born in the old Cherokee Nation in East Tennessee, September, 1804; died in the present Cherokee Nation, July 17, 1844. 'Well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'\\" An inscription in Cherokee is at the bottom. The other side of the monument bears the following inscription: \\"Rev. Jesse Bushyhead was a man noble in person and noble in heart. His choice was to be a true and faithful minister of his Lord and Master rather than any high and worldly position.

He also served as vice governor and a member of the House of the Representatives from the Lone District of Quirino. Aside from his official work as a legislator, he is the Spokesperson and Ambassador of TAO - Trabaho at Oportunidad, a joint effort of public and private sector leaders to contribute to the provision of jobs and opportunities for the Filipino people.  Public Service  Dax, as he is more popularly known, started his career in public service at the age of 23. In 2001, he was elected as Vice Governor of the Province of Quirino becoming the youngest Vice Governor of the country at that time. In 2004, he won a second term as Vice Governor and continued to promote the interests of the youth to participate in the development of the province. His flagship program as Vice Governor, Movement for the Integrated Development of the Youth (MIDY) was aimed at developing the holistic well-being of the youth through scholarship programs, leadership seminars, academic contests, and sporting activities. In 2007, Dax ran and won as Governor of Quirino. As Governor, he prioritized education, health, livelihood, and infrastructure. After years of serving the province as Vice Governor, Dax observed that majority of the problems faced by the province can be traced back to the lack of jobs and opportunities. Before providing jobs and opportunities, it was necessary to improve the education and health of the people so that they can be productive. Infrastructure was also critical so that the goods and services of the province can be delivered to markets. As Governor, he is best remembered for launching I ‚ù§Ô∏è Quirino, a campaign to encourage Quirinians to take pride of their province. As part of the I ‚ù§Ô∏è Quirino, Dax regularly spent half of his time visiting each of the 132 barangays of the province. During each visit, he would bring the services of the Provincial Capitol with him. These included health and dental services, on-the-spot repair of unpaved roads, and other forms of assistance. Through his persistence in reaching out to every Quirinian, he was able to visit each barangay multiple times in a year. Aside from I ‚ù§Ô∏è Quirino, Dax launched Q LIFE or Quirino Livelihood for Everyone during his time as Governor. The program has two components: Rural Improvement Clubs and Livelihood Support. To kickstart micro entrepreneurship in the province, Dax supported the establishment of a Rural Improvement Club in every barangay. The women of each barangay organized themselves into a Rural Improvement Club that provided micro loans to their members for livelihood projects. They elected their own set of officers and established their own rules. The Provincial Government provided the clubs with seed money and audits the performance of each club annually so as to help them improve the management of their funds. To further assist the clubs, the Provincial Government coordinated with the Department of Trade and Industry for the provision of Shared Services Facilities (SSF), equipment that they use for their livelihood projects. Examples of successful livelihood projects funded through a Rural Improvement Club include processed foods such as fruit wine, vegetable chicharon, smoked fish, and longganisa. Under Q LIFE, Quirinians could also apply for Livelihood Support. They undergo an application process and are equipped with working capital and technical knowledge before they proceed with their livelihood project. Some examples of projects supported by Q LIFE include fish pens and corn planting. In 2010, Dax became the Representative of the Lone District of Quirino. Now on his third term, he continues to support the programs he initiated when he was Governor. He continues to prioritize education and is the principal author of RA 10230, which established Quirino State University (QSU) by integrating Quirino State College (QSC), Quirino Polytechnic College (QPC), and Maddela Institute of Technology (MIT). During his three years as Governor, he also launched Q LIFE or Quirino Livelihood for Everyone. finished elementary and secondary education at Xavier School in Greenhills. He graduated from the University of the Philippines with a degree in Business Administration. Dax Cua comes from a family of politicians. His father, Junie E. Cua, and his mother, Ma. Angela E. Cua, were former Representatives of the lone district of Quirino.  Personal life  He is the eldest son of Junie E. Cua and Ma. Angela E. Cua. Junie E. Cua is the current Governor of Quirino and previously served as its Representative for 20 years from 1987 to 1998 and from 2001 to 2010. Dax has been married since 2011 and has three children.

He is best known for a series of wins in major North American turf races in 1972, including the Canadian International Stakes and the Washington, D.C.

His dam was Pradella, whose damsire was Nearco, another undefeated European star and one of the most influential sires of the 20th century. Droll Role was trained by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Thomas J. Kelly. Racing career Droll Role's best performance in a major race at age two was a second-place finish in the 1970 Pimlico-Laurel Futurity. At age three, he had three second-place finishes in graded stakes races without a win. At age four, Droll Role developed into one of the top older horses in North America, winning on both dirt and turf. He ran third in the 1972 Man o' War Stakes, second in the Manhattan Handicap, and second to Quack in world-record time in the mile and a quarter Hollywood Gold Cup. Among his wins, Droll Role captured the Tidal Handicap in course-record time and the Hawthorne Gold Cup Handicap, the Massachusetts Handicap. He also defeated Hall of Fame filly Belle Geste in the Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack, which earned him an invitation to compete in the prestigious Washington, D.C.

Mackay was criticised by his former club Hearts in June 2011 on the official Hearts website. \\"Over a short space of time 4 players at our club have been on the wrong end of the law.

It was built ca. 1910 to carry the Canada Southern Railway over the river (click the link to see a discussion of companies who used the Canada Southern tracks over the years). It is a two-track bridge, although only one track remains in use today. It crosses the river at roughly a 45-degree angle. This bridge is visually similar to the Welland Canal, Bridge 15, although it is a Warren Truss, compared to the Baltimore Truss of Bridge 15.  Navigation on the river  The Welland River meets with the Welland Canal at Port Robinson, Ontario. When the very first canal opened in 1829, it ended at Port Robinson and all vessels followed the Welland River to the Niagara River at Chippawa, Ontario. The canal was extended through to Lake Erie in 1833, but the Welland River remained in service as a commercial shipping channel for approximately another century. It provided a route to the industries along the Niagara River and Buffalo, NY, as well as access to the Erie Canal without journeys through open water. During World War I, a military unit known as the \\"Welland Canal Force\\" (or, sometimes, the \\"Welland Canal Protection Force\\") was created to protect critical shipping links in Niagara, including this bridge. Images available from the Niagara Falls Library \\"Digital Niagara\\" collection show military forces on this bridge, as well as several other locations in the area. There is a level difference of about 8 feet between the Welland River and the Welland Canal, with the canal being the higher of the two. This was overcome via a lock at Port Robinson. This lock was of limited size. As ships increased in size, especially with the opening of the greatly expanded Fourth Welland Canal in 1932, the demand for navigation on the river diminished. A New York Central Railroad timetable published in April, 1936 mentions this bridge and associated interlocking. In an April, 1939 timetable, it is no longer mentioned, therefore it is assumed that the bridge had ceased to swing by that time.  The bridge today  Up until 2001, the bridge carried the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) Hamilton Subdivision to the Michigan Central Railway Bridge crossing the Niagara River to the United States. The line saw several trains per day. Late in that year, the Hamilton Subdivision was abandoned where it passed through the busy tourist area of Niagara Falls and trains were re-routed over a Canadian National Railway line to enter the United States via the International Railway Bridge. The track crossing the Montrose Swing Bridge was re-designated as the Montrose Subdivision. It now exists exclusively to service a couple of industries within the boundaries of the city of Niagara Falls and carries only one or two short trains per week.

Originally developed as a prototype for a tender to the German Army after World War II, the car never reached mass production after the DKW Munga was chosen over it for reasons of economics. The car was propelled by an induced air-cooled flat-four taken from the Porsche 356, located in the rear of the vehicle like the VWs and Porsches of the period; first in an amended version of the 1.5 litre, with a later bump to 1.6 in the l-model. This engine had an output of around 37 kW (50 HP). Together with a vehicle weight of 990 kilograms a maximum speed of around 100 kilometers per hour could be achieved. For transmission, a 5-speed manual box with additional on-the-fly two/four wheel drive shifter was provided. With its short wheelbase of 2,060 mm, the vehicle had the ability to climb steep grades of up to 65%. The prototype body of the car was manufactured by Porsche's own Stuttgart Body Works with later versions (stabilized with torsion bars) coming from Karmann coachworks. The monocoque shell came with no doors and high sills, meaning passengers needed to climb over them to enter and exit the vehicle; The upside of this design being that the body was buoyant and amphibious. Later versions of the body came with rigid doors and exhibit a more steeply dropping angle to the front wings/fenders and bonnet‚Äìhood. 1953 Porsche 597 prototype military vehicle (same as above); rear The Porsche 597 'Hunting Car', alongside the Goliath Type 31 (by the German Federal Armed Forces) were never commissioned for mass production, since, (in the case of the 597), the production costs were too high and the company could not easily supply the sheer numbers of units needed in proposed timescale. Instead the Auto-Union-built DKW Munga model won out for its relative simplicity, lower cost and Auto Union's ability to meet the Army's demand. A total of 71 Porsche 597s were manufactured, between 1955 and 1958, 49 of which were built for the civilian market (chassis numbers starting from 597-000101). Development costs for the vehicle amounted to approximately 1.8 million DM. In August 1959, there were still hopes within the Porsche company to produce an updated vehicle based on the 597 platform with a strengthened chassis, extended wheelbase of 2,400mm that could be made available in five different body-styles. However, the project was eventually cancelled, and the new vehicle never saw the light of day.

Therapeutic immunotoxins that use Pseudomonas exotoxin As of August 2009, several anti-CD22 immunotoxins are undergoing clinical trials. CAT-3888 and CAT-8015 CAT-3888 (or BL22) is an anti-CD22 immunotoxin and completed a Phase I clinical (human) trial for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia at the NIH in the U.S. Technically, CAT-3888 is an anti-CD22 immunotoxin fusion protein between a murine anti-CD22 disulfide-linked Fv (dsFv) antibody fragment and an edited copy of bacterial Pseudomonas exotoxin PE38. The toxin is activated intracellularly, by the low pH of the lysosome into which the entire protein was internalized via the CD22 receptor. The toxin kills the targeted cell through ribosome inactivation. CAT-3888 was initially designed and produced at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, one of the agencies which make up the NIH. Early development of BL22 was funded by California biotech Genencor. In 2001 results were reported of remissions in a phase I trial for leukemia. CAT-3888 was succeeded by moxetumomab pasudotox (CAT-8015, HA22), an anti-CD22 immunotoxin comprising a modified Pseudomonas exotoxin and an anti- CD22 antibody fragment.http://www.cambridgeantibody.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/10857/CAT-3888,_CAT-8015_and_CAT-5001_Nov06.pdf CAT URL Redirects to Medimmune home page Like CAT-3888, CAT-8015 changes three amino acids in the antibody fragment to increase the binding affinity for the target molecule. Both of these proteins are designed to bind to the same part of the CD22 receptor on the surface of B cells. Research is being carried on directly by Dr. Robert J. Kreitman at the National Cancer Institute. The patent holder is MedImmune, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca.

A copy of the film exists. Plot The Boy is the hedonistic son of wealthy eastern parents. One night when he returns home at 2 a.m. from a night of carousing at a dance hall, The Boy's strait-laced father sends him packing to his uncle's ranch in a small western community called Piute Pass. Upon arriving there, The Boy becomes smitten with a local girl. She and her father are seeking work from the villainous Tiger Lip Tompkins who owns half the town and terrorizes its people. He has lecherous plans for The Girl. When she rejects Tompkins' advances, Tompkins holds The Girl's father hostage in an upstairs room in a local saloon. The Boy frees The Girl's father and is hotly pursued by a large posse of Tompkin's white-hood clad hirelings who intend to run him out of the state. Using a number of evasive ploys, The Boy eludes the posse and escapes with The Girl. The film ends with The Boy drawing an engagement ring on The Girl's finger to signify his romantic intentions.

He also served terms as the President of the Corporation of Madras, and then as a Councillor till 1922.Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 146 He was the first non-official President of the Madras Corporation. He was one of the founder-members of the South Indian Chamber of Commerce and served as its President.Some Madras Leaders from 1910 to 1921. When the Industrial Conference came to Madras, Theagaraya Chetty was the Chairman of the Reception Committee. Theagaraya Chetty fought on behalf of the Indian Patriot newspaper and its editor Karunakara Menon against Dr T. M. Nair who later became his close associate. The Dravidian Movement The Madras Non-Brahmin Association was formed in 1909 by two lawyers from Madras city, P. Subramanyam and M. Purushotham Naidu. Sir Theagaroya Chetty did not involve himself in the movement until 1912, when the Madras United League (Later renamed as Madras Dravidian Association) was formed. At a meeting held in Madras in November 1916 by a group of about thirty people, including Theagaraya Chetti and Dr. T. M. Nair, it was resolved to start a company for publishing newspapers advocating the cause of the non-Brahmin community. The newspaper was named Justice and started publishing from 26 February 1917 onwards.Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 17 Dr. T. M. Nair was its first Editor. A political party was organised by the South Indian People's Association under the leadership of Sir P.Theagaroya Chetty and Dr. T. M. Nair and was named the South Indian Liberal Federation. It later came to be popularly known as the Justice Party after the English daily Justice which the party published. The Federation was organised in October 1917 and its objectives were defined as : Early Years of the Justice Party Theagaraya Chetty was elected the first President of the Justice Party and served as President until his death in 1925. A constitution was drawn on 17 October 1917.Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 141 District and city boards were established all over the Presidency.Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 151Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 153‚Äì155 In the initial stages, the Justice Party concentrated its energies on work of a social character than political. During this period, the Justice Party held all-India conferences to unite SCs and Its all over the country.Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 160‚Äì163 The Justice Party argued for separate electorates and reservations in government jobs and civil service for Dalits, at the British Parliament in London.Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 173‚Äì174 In 1919, Dr. T. M. Nair, the President of the Justice Party and leader of the delegation died in London at the age of fifty-one and was succeeded as President by Theagaraya Chetty. 1920 elections When elections were held in December 1920 in the Madras Presidency as per the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, the Justice Party obtained a comfortable majority by winning 63 seats out of 98. The Governor of Madras invited Theagaraya Chetty to form the Government. However, Theagaraya Chetty refused on account of the ethical rule that head of a political party can't hold a post in the cabinet too. As a result, A. Subbarayalu Reddiar was appointed Chief Minister. He served for a few months before being succeeded by the Raja of Panagal. Attitude towards Brahmins In his speech as the President of the Reception Committee of the First Non-Brahmin Confederation, Theagaraya Chetty spoke: Death and legacy History holds the fact that the credit of demolishing the influence of brahminism against the other communities belongs to the Justice Party and its successor party Dravidar Kazhagam. Theagaraya Chetty died on 28 April 1925 and was succeeded by the Raja of Panagal as the President of the Justice Party.Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 187 He is usually credited for the victories of the Justice Party in the 1920 and 1923 elections and for turning the Justice Party into a formidable force in the Presidency that continued to be so for a couple of decades. The locality T Nagar in Chennai is named after him. It is an important commercial centre today.

According to The Guardian, \\"it is an informal understanding, rather than a legally enforceable deal, but it is nevertheless treated with great seriousness within the services\\". It was coined in , and has now entered political discourse as a way of measuring whether the government and society at large have kept to their obligations to support members of the armed forces. The Covenant is a term used mainly by the British Army, other British armed forces and the media in relation to the question of adequate safeguards, rewards and compensation for military personnel who risk their lives in obedience to military orders derived from the policy of the elected civilian government. It is argued that armed forces personnel should expect to be treated fairly by the Crown and expect the support of the nation, society and the government. The Ministry of Defence. states \\"In putting the needs of the Nation, the Army and others before their own, they forgo some of the rights enjoyed by those outside the Armed Forces. So, at the very least, British soldiers should always expect the Nation and their commanders to treat them fairly, to value and respect them as individuals, and to sustain and reward them and their families.\\" Although the term \\"covenant\\" implies some form of legal guarantee or contract, there is in fact no basis in UK law, custom or history for such covenant. Members of the armed forces are recruited and maintained by successive quinquennial Armed Forces Acts as a specific, albeit continuing, derogation from the Bill of Rights 1689, which otherwise prohibits the Crown from maintaining a standing army. The Armed Forces Acts guarantee no such covenant, neither do the Notice Papers served on recruits when attested on enlistment. There has been increased media coverage of the so-called military covenant as the government has been accused of failing to meet it; this criticism came from not just the media, but also several previous Chiefs of the Defence Staff said the government needed to do more to help support injured troops and their families. The Covenant The introduction to ‚ÄòSoldiering - The Military Covenant‚Äô reads:.  History  Recognition of a special bond of mutual obligations between the state and its Armed Forces dates back more than 400 years: a 1593 Elizabeth I statute provided for a weekly tax on parishes not to exceed 6d on the pound, so that disabled army veterans \\"should at their return be relieved and rewarded to the end that they may reap the fruit of their good deservings, and others may be encouraged to perform the like endeavours\\",Soubry, A., MOD Welfare Conference - Speech by Anna Soubry, Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, 19 March 2014, accessed 15 August 2020 and it is thought that this \\"unspoken pact\\" may date back to the reign of Henry VIII.BBC Ethics Guide: Military Covenant, publishes 18 September 2007, accessed 15 August 2020 However, it was not until 2000 that the Army published 'Soldiering ‚Äì the Military Covenant', setting out the obligations on the soldier to make personal sacrifices in the service of the nation, and stated that the armed forces must be sustained by the nation. The code had been drafted over the course of three years by senior officers led by a Brigadier.. The main author was Major-General Sebastian Roberts.. The term 'Military Covenant' was heavily promoted by General Sir Richard Dannatt, who was Chief of the General Staff from 2006.. The existence of government obligations to the armed forces was accepted by the Prime Minister Tony Blair during a keynote lecture on Defence given on 12 January 2007 when he stated that the covenant needed to be renewed, and that \\"it will mean increased expenditure on equipment, personnel and the conditions of our armed forces, not in the short run but for the long term.\\".  Political debate  In September 2007 The Royal British Legion launched a campaign which accused the Government of failing to meet its commitments under the Covenant. The Legion highlighted the case of a 23-year-old paratrooper, injured in battle, who was awarded ¬£152,150 despite injuries requiring care for the rest of his life. It also criticised the practice of treating soldiers in wards alongside civilian patients. In his conference speech that October, Conservative Party leader David Cameron referred to the Covenant and said \\"Mr. Brown, I believe your government has broken it.\\"\\". Responding to the Royal British Legion's campaign, the Secretary of State for Health Alan Johnson announced in November 2007 that armed forces veterans would get priority treatment on the National Health Service, and those injured would be treated immediately in hospital rather than go through waiting lists. Prescription charges would also be waived.. A tight budget settlement for the Ministry of Defence in 2007 saw five former Chiefs of the Defence Staff launch personal criticism of Prime Minister Gordon Brown in a simultaneous House of Lords debate.. In upholding the claim of six Gurkha soldiers for the right to settle in Britain at the end of their service, Mr Justice Blake's judgment in September 2008 recited the Military Covenant before observing that granting them residence in Britain \\"would, in my judgment, be a vindication and an enhancement of this covenant\\".Paragraph 72, Limbu & Ors, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department & Ors 2008 EWHC 2261 (Admin; 30 September 2008). In opposition David Cameron asked Andrew Murrison MP to establish the Military Covenant Commission. Chaired by the author and ex-RAF pilot Frederick Forsyth CBE and with experts including the Falklands veteran Simon Weston OBE its report. heavily influenced the current government's thinking. On 25 June 2010, The Times newspaper reported that Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to enshrine the Military Covenant in law ‚Äì such a development would allow British servicemen and servicewomen to sue the State for breaches of the Military Covenant. In February 2011 the Conservative- Liberal Democrat government decided that there was no need to make the Covenant law, proposing instead to cover it in an annual report to parliament ‚Äì a Labour attempt in an opposition day debate to reverse this was defeated by 86 votes.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed August 8, 2011 tributary of the Susquehanna River in Northumberland and Schuylkill counties, Pennsylvania. There are at least 35 sources of acid mine drainage in the creek's watershed. Anthracite was mined in the upper part of the Mahanoy Creek watershed in the 19th and 20th centuries. Mahanoy Creek's tributaries include Schwaben Creek, Zerbe Run, Little Mahanoy Creek, Shenandoah Creek, and North Mahanoy Creek. Little Mahanoy Creek and Schwaben Creek are two streams in the watershed that are unaffected by acid mine drainage. Schwaben Creek has a higher number and diversity of fish species than the main stem. There are two passive treatment systems in the Mahanoy Creek watershed by the Mahanoy Creek Watershed Association. Coal mining has been done in the watershed since the 19th century and continues to some extent in the 21st century. The watershed is in the Western Middle Anthracite Coal Field. Course Girardville Mahanoy Creek in East Cameron Township, Northumberland County Mahanoy Creek's source is in strip mines in the eastern part of Schuylkill County, near Buck Mountain. It heads west for a short distance before crossing under Pennsylvania Route 54 and entering Mahanoy City, where it picks up the tributary North Mahanoy Creek. Mahanoy Creek continues westward, heading into Mahanoy Township again, and goes through more strip mines. It begins paralleling Bear Ridge for several miles, passing the communities of St. Nicholas and Boston Run before entering Gilberton. In Gilberton, the creek passes under Pennsylvania Route 924 and goes through by the former Mahanoy Plane. Upon leaving Mahanoy Township, the creek enters Butler Township. Soon after entering this township, the creek passes through Girardville, picking up Shenandoah Creek. It parallels Pennsylvania Route 54 for some distance into Ashland. Upon leaving Ashland, the creek stops paralleling Pennsylvania Route 54 and turns south through a gap in Ashland Mountain, leaving behind the strip mines. At Gordon, it picks up Little Mahanoy Creek and then turns west again, meandering out of Butler Township. The creek then briefly meanders through Barry Township before passing into Eldred Township. It flows on the northern side of a mountain in Weiser State Forest. Upon leaving Eldred Township, the creek enters Northumberland County. Mahanoy Creek enters Northumberland County in East Cameron Township. It flows westward for a number of miles through a valley with Line Mountain to the south and Mahanoy Mountain to the north. The creek passes under Pennsylvania Route 125 in this valley. The creek passes into West Cameron Township, flowing west and goes through the township for several miles. It then flows into Little Mahanoy Township. After a short distance, it leaves behind the Line Mountain/Mahanoy Mountain valley and picks up Zerbe Run. Mahanoy Creek then turns southwest and passes by Dornsife before cutting through a gap between Little Mountain and Line Mountain and exiting Little Mahanoy Township. At this point, the creek enters Jackson Township and picks up Schwaben Creek, its last tributary, after some distance. Mahanoy Creek then meanders west to its mouth on the Susquehanna River north of Herndon and ten miles south of Sunbury. Tributaries Mahanoy Creek's tributaries include Little Mahanoy Creek, Schwaben Creek, Shenandoah Creek, Waste House Run, North Mahanoy Creek, and Zerbe Run. There are also several unofficially named tributaries with local names, such as \\"Big Run\\" and \\"Big Mine Run\\". Only Schwaben Creek and Little Mahanoy Creek are unaffected by acid mine drainage. North Mahanoy Creek starts in unpolluted springs on Locust Mountain and meets the main stem in Mahanoy City. There are strip mines in this tributary's watershed. Shenandoah Creek, whose tributaries include Kehley Run and Lost Creek, also begins on Locust Mountain and its watershed has an area of 11.6 square miles. Shenandoah Creek is contaminated by sewage and mine drainage. The tributary Little Mahanoy Creek starts in Frackville and its watershed has an area of 11.6 square miles. No mining has been done in this watershed. Hydrology There are large quantities of dissolved iron and aluminum in the waters of Mahanoy Creek. Additionally, there are trace amounts of various metals, including cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, and lead, sulfates, manganese, and beryllium. There are traces of numerous other metals in the waters, but their concentrations conform to drinking water standards. Out of the 35 or more acid mine drainage sources in the Mahanoy Creek watershed, the four most significant ones are the Locust Gap Tunnel, the Packer #5 Breach, the Packer #5 Borehole, and the Girard Mine seepage. The 15 most significant sources have discharges of between 29,200 liters per minute and 680 liters per minute. The pHs of the sources range from 3.9 to 6.7. The iron concentrations at these sites ranges from 2.1 to 18 milligrams per liter. The concentrations of manganese ranges from 0.95 to 6.4 milligrams per liter. The pH of the stream itself ranges from 3.6 to 8.4, while the pH of the abandoned mine drainage ranges from 2.9 to 7.4. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in Mahanoy Creek ranges from 2.5 to 13.1 milligrams per liter, while the concentration in the watershed's abandoned mine drainage ranges from 0.1 to 9.7 milligrams per liter. The dissolved iron concentration in the stream ranges from under 0.01 milligrams per liter to 6.8 milligrams per liter. The dissolved iron concentration in the abandoned mine drainage ranges from 0.01 to 33 milligrams per liter. The amount of dissolved aluminum in the creek ranges from 0.01 to 8.9 milligrams per liter and the concentration in the abandoned mine drainage ranges from under 0.01 to 17 milligrams per liter. The dissolved manganese concentration in the stream water ranges from 0.01 to 9.2 milligrams per liter and in the abandoned mine drainage it ranges from under 0.01 to 9.7 milligrams per liter. The concentration of dissolved sulfates in the waters of Mahanoy Creek ranges from 4 to 597 milligrams per liter. In the abandoned mine drainage in the creek's watershed, it ranges from 18 to 787 milligrams per liter. The dissolved nitrates concentration in the stream waters ranges from less than 0.01 to 6 milligrams per liter. The concentration in the abandoned mine drainage ranges from less than 0.01 to 0.4 milligrams per liter. In the stream water, the concentration of dissolved phosphorus ranges from less than 0.01 to 0.3 milligrams per liter. In the abandoned mine drainage, the range is 0 to 139 milligrams per liter. The concentration of arsenic is above 0.2 micrograms per liter at most sites in the Mahanoy Creek watershed. The maximum concentration is 7 micrograms per liter. The concentration of barium is above 10 micrograms per liter at all sites in the watershed, and the maximum concentration is 75 micrograms per liter. The beryllium concentration is above 0.05 micrograms per liter at most sites in the watershed, and in some places is as high as 16 micrograms per liter. The cadmium concentration is above 0.02 micrograms per liter in most sites and can be up to 4 micrograms per liter. The maximum chromium concentration is 9 micrograms per liter. Most sites have a concentration of at least 0.02 micrograms per liter of cobalt, with a maximum concentration of 530 micrograms per liter. Most sites have a concentration of at least 0.5 micrograms per liter of copper, with a maximum concentration of 150 micrograms per liter. The lead concentration is above 0.05 micrograms per liter in most sites and can be up to 6.4 micrograms per liter. The maximum nickel concentration in Mahanoy Creek is 895 micrograms per liter and the maximum silver concentration is 0.9 micrograms per liter. The concentration of thallium does not exceed 0.02 micrograms per liter and the concentration of vanadium does not exceed 1 microgram per liter. The maximum concentration of zinc is 3.2 milligrams per liter. Some water from the Shamokin Creek watershed enters the Mahanoy Creek watershed via various mine tunnels, mainly the Doutyville, Helfenstein, the Locust Gap, and the Centralia Mine discharges. Water from Mahanoy Creek also flows through mine tunnels into Shamokin Creek. The discharge of the creek at various locations ranges from 0 to 320 cubic feet per second. The discharge of acid mine drainage in the creek ranges from 0 to 17.2 cubic feet per second. In 2001, the discharge was typically found to be higher in March than in August. While there are sewage-treatment plants in the larger communities in the Mahanoy Creek watershed, there are also leaky sewage disposal systems that discharge sewage into the stream's tributaries. The creek experiences atmospheric disposition, a type of runoff. Geology and geography Mahanoy Creek in East Cameron Township The watershed of Mahanoy Creek is in the Ridge and Valley Appalachians. The lower part of the creek's watershed is in the Northern Shale Valleys and Slopes Ecoregion. The Mahanoy Creek watershed is part of a synclinorium that runs from the northeast to the southwest, running between Hunter and Shenandoah. Rock formations in the watershed include the Pottsville Group and the Llewellyn Formation. These are found on the northern side of the creek's valley. There are 24 coal beds from the Pennsylvanian subperiod, which are part of the Llewellyn Formation and the Pottsville Formation. The coal beds are to thick. Mining of these coal beds has been done at depths of over underground. There are significant silt deposits on the creek downstream of Ashland. In the watershed, there are a number of close-to- parallel ridges and valleys. These tend to be oriented in the same direction as the creek itself, east to west. The highest elevation in the Mahanoy Creek watershed is above sea level in the eastern part of the watershed, not far from Delano. The lowest elevation in the watershed is at the mouth. The elevations of the ridges tend to be between and above sea level, while the valleys are between and lower. The stream bed of Mahanoy Creek has an iron crust near Girardville, but some fish live in that area. Minerals in the acid mine drainage areas of the Mahanoy Creek watershed include goethite, ferrihydrite, schwertmannite, amorphous aluminum-hydroxysulfates, quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, and gypsum. Red shale of the Mauch Chunk Formation is found in a substantial part of the watershed. The main rock types in the watershed are interbedded sedimentary rock, which occupies 70 percent of the watershed, and sandstone, which occupies 30 percent. A number of seeps, boreholes, and mine tunnels contribute water to Mahanoy Creek throughout large sections of the watershed. Mined areas in the upper part of the watershed have been said to \\"resemble a moonscape\\". There are numerous large spoil piles in the upper one-third of the watershed. Some buildings the Mahanoy Creek valley are damaged by subsidence due to underground mining. Watershed Mahanoy Creek near the Dornsife Gap Mahanoy Creek looking upstream near its mouth, from Pennsylvania Route 147 The area of Mahanoy Creek's watershed is 157 square miles (407 square kilometers). The watershed is in Schuylkill, Northumberland, and Columbia County. 42 square miles (109 square kilometers) are located in the Western Middle Anthracite Field. There are at least 35 sources of acid mine drainage in the watershed. The watershed has a population of close to 45,000 people as of July 2009. A tract of land in the Mahanoy Creek watershed has been converted by the Mahanoy Creek Watershed Association into a wetland known as \\"The Swamp\\". It serves as a passive treatment system. This organization has also performed cleanups of the creek at Ashland, Girardville, and Helfenstein. The main stem of the creek is divided into several basins. One basin is the Upper Basin, which is drained by Mahanoy Creek and its tributaries upstream of Shenandoah Creek. It has an area of 21.8 square miles. Another basin is the Ashland Basin, which is drained by Mahanoy Creek and its tributaries between Shenandoah Creek and Big Run, not including the Little Mahanoy Creek watershed. The Ashland basin has an area of 17.7 square miles. The next basin downstream is the Middle Basin, which drains the area where the creek flows between Mahanoy Mountain and Line Mountain, ending at Zerbe Run. This basin has an area of 38.7 square miles. The final basin of Mahanoy Creek is the Lower Basin, which is drained by Mahanoy Creek downstream of Zerbe Run. This basin has an area of 42.7 square miles. The Mahanoy Creek watershed is 66 percent forested land, 21 percent agricultural land, 9 percent barren mined land, and 4 percent developed land. However, the upper part of Mahanoy Creek is 50 percent forested land, 44 percent mined land, 5 percent developed land, and less than 1 percent agricultural land. There are six boroughs in the upper part of the watershed. There are a total of 28 municipalities in the watershed. The eastern edge of the Mahanoy Creek watershed is marked by Locust Mountain and Vulcan Hill. The southern edge is formed by Broad Mountain, Fisher Ridge, and Line Mountain. The northern edge is formed by Little Mountain, Locust Mountain, and Mahanoy Mountain. The drainage system of the watershed is a trellis pattern, a dentritic pattern, or an angular drainage pattern. The streams in the Mahanoy Creek watershed tend to meander relatively little, but the main creek meanders somewhat between Gordon and Lavelle and near its mouth. Mahanoy Creek's headwaters are close to the edge of the Susquehanna River watershed, near the Schuylkill River watershed. History Early history and naming Mahanoy Creek's name comes from a corruption of the Delaware Indian word \\"mahoni\\" or \\"maghonioy\\". The former word means \\"lick\\". The area was owned by the Iroquois before European settlers arrived. The community of Mahanoy City is named after Mahanoy Creek. Modern history Nathan Beach and several other people filed an application for 34 lots at the headwaters of Mahanoy Creek in 1794. The Danville and Pottsville Railroad had a terminus in Girardville, a community of Mahanoy Creek, by 1834. The Mahanoy Creek Navigation Company formed on March 22, 1827. The Mahanoy Creek Canal ran from the Susquehanna River to the coal mines in the upper part of Mahanoy Creek. A canal running from Chester County and Lancaster County to Pittsburgh with a course going through Mahanoy Creek was planned by 1832. In the late 19th century, a company piped waste from the production of illuminating gas (for gas lighting) into Mahanoy Creek. In Gilberton, Mahanoy Creek used to be underground, but surfaced before 1940. Anthracite was mined in the upper part of the Mahanoy Creek watershed from 1840 until 1950. However, farming was also done in the western part of the watershed in the early 20th century. Most of the deep mines ceased operation by 1960. Surface mines instead continued mining operations in the watershed. A total of 12 million short tons of anthracite were mined in the creek's watershed in 1917. This was 12% of the anthracite yield of the state of Pennsylvania in that year. In the 1910s, there were 40 washeries and collieries that drained into the creek. Large amounts of culm also flowed into it during this time. The layer of coal silt on the banks of the creek was by 1940. Several mines remain active in the 21st century, but they mostly reprocess coal waste. At least one covered bridge crosses Mahanoy Creek. It is called the Mahanoy Creek Bridge. It was built in 1940 in Northumberland County and is in length. Two passive treatment systems have been installed in the creek's watershed by the Mahanoy Creek Watershed Association. They are the Mahanoy Creek Aerobic Wetlands, which were created in 2000; and the Bolich Property Wetlands, which were created in 2006. Biology In the fall of 2000, twelve species of fish were observed during electrofishing. They included eastern blacknose dace, northern hognosed suckers, shiners, smallmouth bass, and rock bass. An October 2001 survey of Mahanoy Creek identified two species of fish each at Ashland and Girardville. There were 20 individuals at the latter location and 22 at the former. There were also 13 species and 134 individuals at Gowen City, and 14 species and 545 individuals at the creek's mouth. Additionally, 1003 individuals and 20 species of fish were observed at the mouth of the tributary Schwaben Creek. White Suckers were found at each of the aforementioned sites. Other fish species found on Mahanoy Creek and Schwaben Creek include the swallowtail shiner, the rosyface shiner, the river chub, the banded darter, and the shield darter. Brown trout, longnose dace, and eastern blacknose dace have also been observed in the watershed. Historically, deer came to the creek to consume salt. There are second-growth forests near Kehly Run, a tributary of Mahanoy Creek. Recreation The Pennsylvania State Game Land Number 84 is located immediately south of Mahanoy Creek between Helfenstein and Dornsife. The Sen. James J. Rhoades Nature Trail is a walking trail along the creek in Barry Township. It was dedicated to James J. Rhoades on May 8, 2010. Catch and release fishing of smallmouth bass and largemouth bass is permitted on the creek.

Symptoms used to diagnose the disease are angular, water soaked lesions and necrotic blotches. Aphelenchoides fragariae is the nematode pathogen that causes the disease. Its biological cycle includes four life stages, three of which are juvenile. The nematode can undergo multiple life cycles in one growing season when favorable conditions are present. They can infect the crowns, runners, foliage, and new buds of the plant via stylet penetration or through the stomata. The best management practices for this disease are sanitation, prevention of induction of the pathogen to the environment, and planting clean seed or starter plants. Importance Foliar nematodes are an important plant pathogen to agricultural crops and ornamental plants in the United States, Canada, and Europe.Jagdale, G. B. (2002).

Since 1991‚Äì1992, strawberry foliar nematode incidence numbers have been increasing in a variety of plants, but especially in strawberry and greenhouse plants such as Hosta.Grabowski, M.

Retrieved October 17, 2011 There are several causes for the increasing problem of foliar nematodes in agriculture, greenhouse nurseries, and personal lawns, but there are no systemic nematicides available to growers due to the hazards they pose to people handling the plants. Advancements in plant breeding have enabled nurseries to produce more vegetative plants, which may cause infection of new plants via propagation from infected plants. Plants are also moved long distance to growers across the country and internationally, thus nematodes can easily spread to new areas where infection was previously not a problem.Hartman, J. (2006, July). Plant Pathology Fact Sheet: Foliar Nematodes of Ornamentals. Retrieved October 11, 2010, from University of Kentucky College of Agriculture Cooperative Extension Service: http://www.ca.uky.edu/agcollege/plantpathology/ext_files/PPFShtml/PPFS- OR-H-3.pdf Agriculturally, foliar nematode can be devastating to alfalfa and strawberry. Strawberry is a major crop in California where fruit production is valued over $523 million. Foliar nematodes reduce fruit and plant yield because they feed on the leaves, crowns, and flower buds of the strawberry plant.Qui, J., Westerdahl, B., Buchner, R., & Anderson, C. (1993). Ref inement of Hot Water Treatment for Management of. Journal of Nematology, 25(4), 795‚Äì799. Ornamental plants are also a multimillion-dollar industry in the United States, and foliar nematodes destroy these plants as well. In less severe cases of nematode infection, the appearance of the plant is affected by the symptoms of disease, which gives an undesirable appearance in ornamental plants. This reduces the value of the plant and makes most infected plants unmarketable. It is difficult to quantitatively estimate the value of the amount of damage caused by nematodes because they are a persistent pathogen once they are introduced to the soil. However, in a multimillion-dollar industry, any amount of yield loss could result in loss of millions of dollars‚Äô worth of crop. Symptoms In fields, symptomatic plants are recognized in patches or rows. They appear dwarfed, stunted, and brown in comparison to healthy plants. Local symptoms appear above ground, and plant leaves are typically distorted in shape, crinkled, and discolored with hard surfaces. They often have reduced flower size. Diseased plants typically have dead crowns and a shortened internode of the runners.R.A.Dunn (2005.June) Foliar Nematodes as Pests of Ornamental Plants. Department of Entomology and Nematology, from Florida Cooperative Extension Service, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida. IPN: SP221: http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in036 A classic leaf symptom is the appearance of angular, water-soaked lesions between the veins. The angular appearance results where the lesion edge and vein meet. In leaves with parallel venation, the length of the lesion progresses parallel to the direction of the vein. As lesions enlarge and leaf damage progresses, symptomatic leaf edges become dry, dead, and crinkled. Because infected strawberry plants are less vigorous in growth, the stolon does not grow well, which results in reduced fruit size and number. If the nematodes infect early in plant development, specifically when the buds are forming, the plant morphology will be dwarfed and distorted. Once the nematodes destroy most of the leaf tissue, they leave the plant through wounds and natural openings in the leaf to find a new host to infect. The pathogen is easily transmitted through direct contact between the foliage of infected and non-infected plants. Nematodes can also move over large distances through soil transportation, as a result of human and animal movement, or through insect and bird travel. Angular lesion symptoms caused by foliar nematode Biology After the growing season, Aphalenchoides fragariae adults and juveniles may remain in soils for up to three months, while eggs may stay dormant for years until favorable conditions arise. Overwintering only occurs in dead plant tissues, and nematodes may successfully remain dormant in temperatures as low as 2 ¬∞C.Cobon, J and O'Neill, W. (2011, August).

However, if conditions become unfavorable, adult and juvenile nematodes may become dormant either in strawberry or nearby weed tissue until ideal conditions arise. Nematodes can be dispersed within an area through irrigation, direct contact of healthy plants with infected, or poor sanitation techniques. Foliar nematodes of a related species, Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi Feeding normally occurs via stylet penetration of epidermal cells, but sometimes nematodes can enter through stomatal openings and feed from within the mesophyll cell layer. A study showed that Aphalenchoides fragariae is more attracted to CO2 than oxygen emissions in a controlled environment using artificial stomatal openings which expelled each gas respectively. Researchers were able to make these conclusions based on the obvious accumulation of the nematodes on and within artificial stomates expelling CO2. This suggests these nematodes are able to locate stomata based on chemical sensing.Klingler, J. (1970). The Reaction of Aphelenchoides Fragariae To Slit-Like Micro-Openings and To Stomatal Diffusion Gasses. Nematologica, 16(3), 417‚Äì422(6). Management Strawberry foliar nematodes are difficult to manage due to their robust life cycle. While dormant, they are quite difficult to kill, and they remain viable in dry debris for more than one year. Adult nematodes can survive desiccation and lie dormant for several years. Eggs can stay dormant until survival conditions are optimal for growth. Once eggs or nematodes are present in the soil, they are nearly impossible to eradicate because they can move laterally in the soil to escape non-optimal conditions. They are found in most foliar tissue, including the leaves, stems, buds, and crowns, making it difficult to control the disease on the plant itself once it has been infected . Many plant diseases are managed chemically, but due to a ban of nematicides there are currently no nematicides available for any type of foliar nematode. Some insecticides, pesticides, and plant product extracts from plants such as Ficus and Coffee (of which many pesticides and nematicides are neem-based Mohammad Akhtar, Irshad Mahmood, Potentiality of phytochemicals in nematode control: A review, Bioresource Technology, Volume 48, Issue 3, 1994, Pages 189‚Äì201, ISSN 0960-8524, 10.1016/0960-8524(94)90146-5.) can be used to reduce the numbers of strawberry foliar nematode (a reduction of 67‚Äì85%), but none of these chemicals can completely eradicate the nematodes once they are present in the soil. These chemicals affect all stages of the life cycle because they target the nervous system. One chemical, ZeroTol, a broad-spectrum fungicide and algaecide, was shown be to 100% potent against nematodes living in a water suspension, but the study does not show how nematodes are affected in soil or outside of a laboratory environment. An alternative method of control is a hot water treatment, which affects all stages of the life cycle and can be used on whole plants. This treatment has been used for 60 years with some effect in greenhouse plants, but not on a widespread agricultural level. The difficulty in this treatment is that exposure times to hot water and the temperature of the water must be optimized so that the nematodes are killed, but the cultivar remains undamaged. One study, which researched five California strawberry cultivars including Chandler, Douglas, Fern, Pajaro, and Selva, demonstrated that the minimum-maximum exposure times and temperatures that killed the nematodes but did not harm the cultivars were: 20‚Äì30 minutes at 44.4‚Å∞C, 10‚Äì15 minutes at 46.1‚Å∞C, and 8‚Äì10 minutes at 47.7‚Å∞. The study also found that fruit production was more sensitive to the treatment than mere survival of the plant, so the minimum exposure times are recommended when using plants for fruit production, and the maximum time is recommended when using plants for propagation. One of the best and most practiced forms of management to reduce the local and geographical spread of the disease is sanitation. Removing the infected leaves of the plant can reduce spread in the individual plant, but because the nematode is found in most foliar tissue the nematodes may already be present in other tissues before the leaf symptoms appear. The nematodes can also move on the outside of the plant surface when water is present, so the nematodes can move around the outside surface of the plant and infect new tissues. Therefore, once plants show any signs of infection, they should be removed and destroyed. Reducing or eliminating overhead irrigation can prevent dispersal of the nematode through water splashing, and keeping the foliage dry prevents the nematodes from moving on the outside of the plant. Plants should be placed further apart to allow water to dry quickly after irrigation. In the greenhouse or nursery, soils, containers, and tools should be sterilized on a regular basis, and the floor and storage areas should be free from plant debris. The most important form of management is prevention of introduction of the nematode to the environment. One should avoid planting infected plants, and it is recommended that new plants (especially in a personal lawn or greenhouse) be planted in an isolated area to monitor the plant for the development of symptoms before transplanting the plant near established plants. This will prevent the established plants from getting infected from a new, infected plant. All symptomatic plants should be destroyed immediately. Dead plant material should also be handled with caution. Vermiform nematodes can survive and reproduce in compost piles of dead plant material by feeding on fungi that are commonly found in compost. As a result, infected plants should be burned and sterilized to prevent the nematodes from infecting soil (which results directly from burying the material), or other plants (from allowing the plant to remain rooted in the soil near other plants as it dies).

It was also the first of the 100 series to include a lithium-ion backup battery to preserve RAM contents when the battery is replaced, as well as the first Macintosh ever to use less expensive and larger IDE drives (formatting required a unique software application limiting the selection of compatible drives). This was the last PowerBook model to include a trackball. Like the 145B it replaced, the 150 could not be used in SCSI Disk Mode, unlike the Duo, 190 and 5300 which had HD Target Mode implemented.

Family Compton was the third but second eldest surviving son of Admiral William Compton, 4th Marquess of Northampton, and his wife Eliza, daughter of Admiral Sir George Elliot. William Compton, 5th Marquess of Northampton, was his elder brother. In 1886, he married Mary Evelyn Violet, daughter of Robert Charles de Grey Vyner (she was thereafter known as Lady Alwyne Compton). Military career He was educated at Eton and entered the 31st Foot as a sub-lieutenant on 18 March 1874. He exchanged to the Grenadier Guards on 12 May 1875. Promoted to supernumerary lieutenant, Compton again exchanged into the 10th Hussars on 20 August 1879. In May 1882, he became aide-de-camp to George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, Viceroy of India, until the latter left office in February 1884, and was appointed full lieutenant on 28 November 1883. Compton subsequently took part in the British campaign in the Sudan in 1884, and fought at El Teb and Tamai. He was appointed adjutant in March 1885, and resigned his adjutantcy on 20 October 1886. He reigned from the army and was appointed to the Reserve of Officers. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, Compton volunteered for service and was seconded to the Imperial Yeomanry, where he was appointed a captain on 17 February 1900. He was attached to the 28th (Bedfordshire) company of the 4th Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry. The company left Albert Docks in the SS Kent in early February 1900, Lord Alwyn in command as senior officer on the ship, and arrived at South Africa the following month. For his service, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in November 1900, and promoted to major in September 1901. Political career He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1895 general election as the Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for the Biggleswade division of Bedfordshire. Compton was re-elected unopposed in 1900, but at the 1906 general election he was defeated by the Liberal Party candidate Arthur Black. He was returned to the Commons at the January 1910 election as Unionist MP for Brentford,Craig, page 344 and held the seat until his resignation on 15 March 1911 by the procedural device of appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. He died in December 1911, aged 56. Lady Alwyne Compton died in October 1957.

The genotyping stage employs different techniques, including single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis chips (typically 0.02% of the genome), or partial or full genome sequencing. Once the genotypes are known, the individual's variations can be compared with the published literature to determine likelihood of trait expression, ancestry inference and disease risk. Automated high-throughput sequencers have increased the speed and reduced the cost of sequencing, making it possible to offer whole genome sequencing including interpretation to consumers since 2015 for less than $1,000. The emerging market of direct-to-consumer genome sequencing services has brought new questions about both the medical efficacy and the ethical dilemmas associated with widespread knowledge of individual genetic information.  In personalized medicine  Personalized medicine is a medical method that targets treatment structures and medicinal decisions based on a patient's predicted response or risk of disease. The National Cancer Institute or NCI, an arm of the National Institutes of Health, lists a patient's genes, proteins, and environment as the primary factors analyzed to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease through personalized medicine. There are various subcategories of the concept of personalized medicine such as predictive medicine, precision medicine and stratified medicine. Although these terms are used interchangeably to describe this practice, each carries individual nuances. Predictive medicine describes the field of medicine that utilizes information, often obtained through personal genomics techniques, to both predict the possibility of disease, and institute preventative measures for a particular individual. Precision medicine is a term very similar to personalized medicine in that it focuses on a patient's genes, environment, and lifestyle; however, it is utilized by National Research Council to avoid any confusion or misinterpretations associated with the broader term. Stratified medicine is a version of personalized medicine which focuses on dividing patients into subgroups based on specific responses to treatment, and identifying effective treatments for the particular group. Examples of the use of personalized medicine include oncogenomics and pharmacogenomics. Oncogenomics is a field of study focused on the characterization of cancer‚Äìrelated genes. With cancer, specific information about a tumor is used to help create a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. Pharmacogenomics is the study of how a person's genome affects their response to drugs. This field is relatively new but growing fast due in part to an increase in funding for the NIH Pharmacogenomics Research Network. Since 2001, there has been an almost 550% increase in the number of research papers in PubMed related to the search terms pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics. This field allows researchers to better understand how genetic differences will influence the body's response to a drug and inform which medicine is most appropriate for the patient. These treatment plans will be able to prevent or at least minimize the adverse drug reactions which are a, \\"significant cause of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States.\\" Overall, researchers believe pharmacogenomics will allow physicians to better tailor medicine to the needs of the individual patient. As of November 2016, the FDA has approved 204 drugs with pharmacogenetics information in its labeling. These labels may describe genotype-specific dosing instructions and risk for adverse events amongst other information. Disease risk may be calculated based on genetic markers and genome-wide association studies for common medical conditions, which are multifactorial and include environmental components in the assessment. Diseases which are individually rare (less than 200,000 people affected in the USA) are nevertheless collectively common (affecting roughly 8-10% of the US population). Over 2500 of these diseases (including a few more common ones) have predictive genetics of sufficiently high clinical impact that they are recommended as medical genetic tests available for single genes (and in whole genome sequencing) and growing at about 200 new genetic diseases per year.  Cost of sequencing an individual's genome  Typical cost of sequencing a human-sized genome, on a logarithmic scale. Note the drastic trend faster than Moore's law beginning in January 2008 as post-Sanger sequencing came online at sequencing centers. The cost of sequencing a human genome is dropping rapidly, due to the continual development of new, faster, cheaper DNA sequencing technologies such as \\"next-generation DNA sequencing\\". The National Human Genome Research Institute, an arm of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, has reported that the cost to sequence a whole human- sized genome has dropped from about $14 million in 2006 to below $1,500 by late 2015. There are 6 billion base pairs in the diploid human genome. Statistical analysis reveals that a coverage of approximately ten times is required to get coverage of both alleles in 90% human genome from 25 base pair reads with shotgun sequencing. This means a total of 60 billion base pairs that must be sequenced. An Applied Biosystems SOLiD, Illumina or Helicos sequencing machine can sequence 2 to 10 billion base pairs in each $8,000 to $18,000 run. The cost must also take into account personnel costs, data processing costs, legal, communications and other costs. One way to assess this is via commercial offerings. The first such whole diploid genome sequencing (6 billion bp, 3 billion from each parent) was from Knome and their price dropped from $350,000 in 2008 to $99,000 in 2009. This inspects 3000-fold more bases of the genome than SNP chip-based genotyping, identifying both novel and known sequence variants, some relevant to personal health or ancestry. In June 2009, Illumina announced the launch of its own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service at a depth of 30X for $48,000 per genome. In 2010, they cut the price to $19,500. In 2009, Complete Genomics of Mountain View announced that it would provide full genome sequencing for $5,000, from June 2009. This will only be available to institutions, not individuals. Prices are expected to drop further over the next few years through economies of scale and increased competition. As of 2014, nearly complete exome sequencing was offered by Gentle for less than $2,000, including personal counseling along with the results.{http://www.healthcarejournallr.com/the-journal/contents- index/features/563-what-a-tangled-web-we-weave.html} As of late 2018, over a million human genomes have been nearly completely sequenced for as little as $200 per person, and even under certain circumstances ultra-secure personal genomes for $0 each. In those two cases, the actual cost is reduced because the data can be monetized for researchers. The decreasing cost in general of genomic mapping has permitted genealogical sites to offer it as a service, to the extent that one may submit one's genome to crowd sourced scientific endeavours such as OpenSNP or DNA.land at the New York Genome Center, as examples of citizen science. The Corpas family, led by scientist Manuel Corpas, developed the Corpasome project, and encouraged by the low prices in genome sequencing, was the first example of citizen science crowd sourced analysis of personal genomes.  Ethical issues  Genetic discrimination is discriminating on the basis of information obtained from an individual's genome. Genetic non-discrimination laws have been enacted in some US states and at the federal level, by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). The GINA legislation prevents discrimination by health insurers and employers, but does not apply to life insurance or long-term care insurance. The passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 strengthened the GINA protections by prohibiting health insurance companies from denying coverage because of patient's \\"pre-existing conditions\\" and removing insurance issuers ability to adjust premium costs based on certain factors such as genetic diseases. Given the ethical concerns about pre-symptomatic genetic testing of minors, it is likely that personal genomics will first be applied to adults who can provide consent to undergo such testing, although genome sequencing is already proving valuable for children if any symptoms are present. There are also concerns regarding human genome research in developing countries. The tools for conducting whole genome analyses are generally found in high-income nations, necessitating partnerships between developed and developing countries in order to study the patients afflicted with certain diseases. The relevant tools for sharing access to the collected data are not equally accessible across low-income nations and without an established standard for this type of research, concerns over fairness to local researchers remain unsettled. Other issues  Genetic privacy  In the United States, biomedical research containing human subjects is governed by a baseline standard of ethics known as The Common Rule, which aims to protect a subject's privacy by requiring \\"identifiers\\" such as name or address to be removed from collected data. A 2012 report by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues stated, however, that \\"what constitutes 'identifiable' and 'de- identified' data is fluid and that evolving technologies and the increasing accessibility of data could allow de-identified data to become re-identified.\\" In fact, research has already shown that it is \\"possible to discover a study participant's identity by cross-referencing research data about him and his DNA sequence ‚Ä¶ [with] genetic genealogy and public-records databases.\\" This has led to calls for policy-makers to establish consistent guidelines and best practices for the accessibility and usage of individual genomic data collected by researchers. There is also controversy regarding the concerns with companies testing individual DNA. There are issues such as \\"leaking\\" information, the right to privacy and what responsibility the company has to ensure this does not happen. Regulation rules are not clearly laid out. What is still not determined is who legally owns the genome information: the company or the individual whose genome has been read. There have been published examples of personal genome information being exploited. Additional privacy concerns, related to, e.g., genetic discrimination, loss of anonymity, and psychological impacts, have been increasingly pointed out by the academic community as well as government agencies. Additional issues arise from the trade-off between public benefit from research sharing and exposure to data escape and re-identification. The Personal Genome Project (started in 2005) is among the few to make both genome sequences and corresponding medical phenotypes publicly available.  Personalized genome utility  Full genome sequencing holds large promise in the world of healthcare in the potential of precise and personalized medical treatments. This use of genetic information to select appropriate drugs is known as pharmacogenomics. This technology may allow treatments to be catered to the individual and the certain genetic predispositions they may have (such as personalized chemotherapy). Among the most impactful and actionable uses of personal genome information is the avoidance of hundreds of severe single-gene genetic disorders which endanger about 5% of newborns (with costs up to 20 million dollars), for example elimination of Tay Sachs Disease via Dor Yeshorim. Another set of 59 genes vetted by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG-59) are considered actionable in adults. At the same time, full sequencing of the genome can identify polymorphisms that are so rare and/or mild sequence change that conclusions about their impact are challenging, reinforcing the need to focus on the reliable and actionable alleles in the context of clinical care. Czech medical geneticist Eva Mach√°ckov√° writes: \\"In some cases it is difficult to distinguish if the detected sequence variant is a causal mutation or a neutral (polymorphic) variation without any effect on phenotype. The interpretation of rare sequence variants of unknown significance detected in disease-causing genes becomes an increasingly important problem.\\" In fact, researchers from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) project estimated the average person to carry 54 genetic mutations that previously were assumed pathogenic, i.e. having 100% penetrance, but without any apparent negative health presentation. As with other new technologies, doctors can order genomic tests for which some are not correctly trained to interpret the results. Many are unaware of how SNPs respond to one another. This results in presenting the client with potentially misleading and worrisome results which could strain the already overloaded health care system. In theory, this might antagonize an individual to make uneducated decisions such as unhealthy lifestyle choices and family planning modifications. Negative results which may potentially be inaccurate, theoretically decrease the quality of life and mental health of the individual (such as increased depression and extensive anxiety).  Direct-to-consumer genetics  microarrays for genotyping. The video shows the process of extracting genotypes from a human spit sample using microarrays as is done by most major direct-to-consumer genetics companies. There are also three potential problems associated with the validity of personal genome kits. The first issue is the test's validity. Handling errors of the sample increases the likelihood for errors which could affect the test results and interpretation. The second affects the clinical validity, which could affect the test's ability to detect or predict associated disorders. The third problem is the clinical utility of personal genome kits and associated risks, and the benefits of introducing them into clinical practices. People need to be educated on interpreting their results and what they should be rationally taking from the experience. Concerns about customers misinterpreting health information was one of the reasons for the 2013 shutdown by the FDA of 23&Me;'s health analysis services. It is not only the average person who needs to be educated in the dimensions of their own genomic sequence but also professionals, including physicians and science journalists, who must be provided with the knowledge required to inform and educate their patients and the public.Lunshof, Jeantine; Mardis Elaine [Retrieved from http://www.future- science-group.com/_img/pics/Mardis_Forward.pdf \\"Navigenics - How it works\\"].

A major use of personal genomics outside the realm of health is that of ancestry analysis, including evolutionary origin information such as neanderthal content. Popular culture The 1997 science fiction film GATTACA presents a near-future society where personal genomics is readily available to anyone, and explores its societal impact. Perfect DNA is a novel that uses Dr Manuel Corpas‚Äô own experiences and expertise as genome scientist to begin exploring some of these tremendously challenging issues.  Other uses  In 2018, police arrested Joseph James DeAngelo the prime suspect for the Golden State Killer or East Area Rapist and William Earl Talbott II as the prime suspect in the murder of Jay Cook and Tanya Van Cuylenborg in 1987. These arrests were based on the personal genomics uploaded to an open-source database, GEDmatch, which allowed investigators to compare DNA recovered from crime scenes to the DNA uploaded to the database by relatives of the suspect. In December 2018, FamilyTreeDNA changed its terms of service to allow law enforcement to use their service to identify suspects of \\"a violent crime\\" or identify the remains of victims. The company confirmed it was working with the FBI on at least a handful of cases meaning GEDmatch was no longer the only to do so. Since then nearly 50 suspects in crimes of assault, rape or murder have been arrested using the same method.https://slate.com/technology/2019/03/genetic-genealogy-law-enforcement- suspects-dna-privacy-gedmatch.html Personal genomics have also allowed investigators to identify previously unknown bodies using GEDmatch (the Buckskin Girl, Lyle Stevik and Joseph Newton Chandler III).

After a four-day manhunt that stretched across three states, all three suspects Dexter Bostic, Robert Ellis and Lee Woods were eventually apprehended and convicted‚Äîtwo of murder, and the third for weapons possession. At his widely attended funeral, Timoshenko was posthumously promoted to the rank of Detective. The case garnered national media attention because the weapons used were all illegally obtained handguns. This sparked widespread debate over gun control laws in New York City, and over the process by which firearms are traced by police departments. Murder Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, had been driving in a marked 71st precinct police car on patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the passenger, when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sport utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers scanned the BMW's license plate on a computer in their police car. When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to pull over. The driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle. Before the officers arrived at the front of the car, Dexter Bostic, 34, opened fire from the passenger's seat with a .45 caliber handgun, striking Timoshenko once in the face and once in the throat. Yan had been approaching on the driver's side, while Timoshenko was coming up from the passenger's side. From the back seat of the BMW, Robert Ellis, 34, shot Yan with a 9mm handgun, striking him in the arm and chest; Yan was saved by his ballistic vest and was able to return fire. A third suspect, 29-year-old Lee Woods, was driving the BMW at the time of the shooting. After firing at least seven rounds at the officers, the three suspects fled the scene. Police later found the abandoned car on Kingston Avenue, about four blocks from where the shooting occurred. Timoshenko was rushed to Kings County Hospital Center once medical personnel arrived at the scene. Each of the two bullets that struck Timoshenko cut across his spinal cord, just beneath his brain, which left him unable to breathe on his own or to move his muscles. According to doctors, he had no oxygen for 15 to 20 minutes after he was shot because of his initial paralysis. The loss of oxygen left him in a coma since the shooting, so he was placed on life support machines that allowed him to breathe. Tests conducted on July 14 determined that he had no brain activity (matching the definition of legal death in the state of New York); as a result, the doctors pronounced him dead at 4:14 p.m. and turned off the artificial respirator. He was 23 years old at the time of his death. Motive Media reports stated that the men committed the crime in an effort to avoid returning to prison, as all three had violent criminal records. Bostic previously served nine years in state prison for assault, robbery, and sodomy in 1990. He was sent to prison again in 2001 to serve three years for armed robbery (in which an accomplice fired shots), resulting in his second felony. In 1992, at the age of 19, Ellis was convicted of first- degree rape and sodomy. Woods was sent to prison in 1997, also at age 19, for illegal weapons possession and assaulting a police officer during his arrest. If the police identified Bostic even before the shooting occurred, he would have faced a two-year prison sentence for violating the terms of his parole, since he was out past his curfew. After the shooting, police discovered the BMW had been stolen from the Five Towns Mitsubishi car dealership in Inwood, Long Island, where Bostic worked as a salesman. A motor vehicle theft or gun possession conviction would have been Bostic's third felony, likely resulting in a lengthy prison sentence. Aftermath Manhunt Police apprehended Lee Woods at the home of his girlfriend, Nicole Bostic (Dexter Bostic‚Äôs sister), in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York, on July 10. He identified Bostic and Ellis as his accomplices, and told police that while he knew his friends had guns, he was unaware they were going to open fire on the officers. City detectives were tipped to the whereabouts of Bostic and Ellis on the afternoon of July 11, after being contacted by a man who, unaware of the suspects' fugitive status, assisted the suspects in their escape by driving them across Long Island, from Far Rockaway to Port Jefferson, New York, before riding a ferry across Long Island Sound to Bridgeport, Connecticut. They then drove west, stopping at a supermarket in Tarrytown, New York, where they purchased food and water, before continuing on to Pennsylvania, according to New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. Remnants of the same food the men purchased were found in a Pennsylvania forest, where investigators had eventually tracked the suspects. Hundreds of NYPD officers, U.S. marshals, and Pennsylvania State Troopers were involved in the manhunt, using helicopters and four police dogs to assist with the search. By July 11, 2007, the bounty for information leading to the whereabouts of Bostic and Ellis reached $64,000, with the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association proposing an additional $25,000. The driver initially dropped off Bostic and Ellis about 14 miles from where Bostic was finally arrested in Pocono Township, Pennsylvania. On July 11, a passing motorist spotted the fugitives by Interstate 80 and called police. The men fled when authorities arrived at the scene shortly after, but Bostic was tackled by a state trooper shortly after 6 p.m., while Ellis managed to escape. At 8 a.m. the next morning, Ellis was cornered near I-80 by two police dogs. Both men were extradited to New York from Pennsylvania on July 12. Police brought Timoshenko's handcuffs and used them to apprehend Ellis during his arrest. Police did not release the name of the driver who assisted the suspects. Mourning Over 30,000 people attended Timoshenko's funeral in Flatlands, Brooklyn, where Mayor Michael Bloomberg delivered the eulogy, praising the fallen officer, stating, \\"By stopping that car, he and Officer Yan helped us capture three career criminals whose appetite for evil knew no bounds‚Äîsaving who knows how many future victims, people who will never know how lucky they are.\\" Detective Timoshenko‚Äôs name is engraved on Panel 16-West, Line 26 of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC. Awards and recognition Timoshenko had served with the NYPD for 18 months. In a ceremony held on July 27, 2007, Timoshenko was posthumously promoted to the rank of Detective First Grade and his partner, Herman Yan, was promoted to Detective. Mayor Bloomberg called the promotion, \\"A small measure of our appreciation for the supreme sacrifice that Russel made, and to honor his life.\\" On June 16, 2008, Mayor Bloomberg and NYPD Commissioner Kelly bestowed the New York City Police Department Medal of Honor on Timoshenko and Yan. The award is the highest law enforcement medal given by the NYPD, which was awarded posthumously to Timoshenko and accepted by his parents in a ceremony held at the NYPD headquarters in New York. New York Governor David Paterson named the two officers Police Officers of the Year in New York State on July 24, 2009. The award, first given in 1983, recognizes a single police officer or team for \\"an exceptional act of valor symbolizing the service of police in New York State.\\" On October 6, 2009, Timoshenko's parents accepted the James S. Brady Law Enforcement Award (named after the former assistant to President Ronald Reagan), given to their son posthumously in recognition of his commitment to public safety through his outstanding law enforcement career. The award was presented by NYPD Commissioner Kelly. In November 2009, a local street, Durant Avenue, was renamed to Detective Russel Timoshenko Way in the detective's honor.Bay Terrace Street renamed for slain officer Incidentally, following the controversial decision to rename a street to Sean Bell Way for police shooting victim Sean Bell, some community members had recommended doing the same for Timoshenko. However, the latter case had attracted much less media attention. Trial All three suspects were arraigned and charged with aggravated first degree murder for the killing of Timoshenko, and other charges related to the wounding of Yan, including attempted murder and aggravated assault on a police officer. They faced life in prison if convicted of the first degree murder charges. The city's police union and other parties asked federal prosecutors to take over the case so that the three suspects could face the death penalty, but the case was tried by the Brooklyn district attorney on November 10, 2008, after federal officials refused to prosecute the case. Although the three defendants were being prosecuted simultaneously, there was a rare separate jury assigned to each of them. On December 17, 2008, Robert Ellis was found not guilty on the charges of aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder, but was found guilty on three charges of gun possession. On January 14, 2009, a judge sentenced Ellis to 15 years in prison on the gun possession charges. On December 19, 2008, Dexter Bostic was found guilty of aggravated murder, attempted aggravated murder, and three charges of gun possession; he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Lee Woods was tried twice, after his first trial ended in a mistrial due to a juror in her 20s falling ill. Wood's attorney, Samuel J. Karlin, told the judge his client wanted to continue with the ill juror, instead of using an alternate. At his second trial on March 16, 2009, Lee Woods was found guilty of aggravated murder, attempted aggravated murder, and 3 charges of gun possession. He was also sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.Convicted Cop Killer Gets Life Sentence Without Parole Prosecutors believed Nicole Bostic, 26 at the time, aided Lee Woods in hiding the guns found in the BMW that Timoshenko and Yan pulled over, dumping them in a nearby garage before police retrieved them; N. Bostic, however, only admitted to giving Woods a ride. She pled guilty to helping the three men escape, and originally faced seven years in prison for her role. She later accepted a plea bargain, pleading guilty to a misdemeanor count of hindering the prosecution in exchange for three years probation, thereby avoiding jail. Gun legislation Several press accounts reported that Timoshenko was shot by an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by a person with a criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought to make it easier for law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties. Senate hearings In September 2007, Senator Charles Schumer questioned Michael J. Sullivan, nominated to be the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing looking into why the NYPD's request for information on who had sold the gun (used to kill Timoshenko) was denied. The NYPD asked the ATF for data about which dealers in Virginia supplied the most crime guns‚Äîlike the one used to kill Officer Timoshenko‚Äîso they could identify the traffickers. The ATF refused that request for data, citing the Tiahrt Amendment, which restricts cities' access to and use of ATF trace data). The New York Daily News ran a headline editorial in support for repealing the amendment, entitled \\"Congress Owes This Hero.\\" At the Senate hearing in Washington D.C., Schumer stated, \\"If this is true, it is an outrage. If it is true, it is a horrible example of gun laws gone wrong.\\" Sullivan, then acting director of the ATF, replied to the criticism, stating, \\"I'm not sure why the request was turned down\\", and pledged to look into the matter and provide further clarification in writing. New gun laws for New York City The complications regarding the illegal firearms used in Timoshenko's murder inspired new laws passed in New York City, which authorized new penalties, touted as \\"part of the toughest illegal gun possession law in the country.\\" A public awareness campaign, named \\"GUNS=PRISON\\", featured posters calling attention to the 3 ¬Ω year prison sentence given to anyone caught carrying an illegal loaded handgun in New York. At a press conference, Mayor Bloomberg stated, \\"Police Officer Russell Timoshenko was just the latest victim killed by a gunman firing at close range. If the prospect of three and a half years in jail deters just one would-be killer from carrying a gun and taking the life of another police officer in another deadly confrontation, then the law and the efforts to publicize it are well worth it.\\" NFL player Plaxico Burress was charged with this new law due to an incident that occurred inside of a New York City nightclub. On August 20, 2009, Burress plead guilty to a gun possession charge and agreed to a two-year prison sentence.

The cemetery holds over 11,500 dead from both World War I and World War II. History √âtaples was the scene of much Allied activity during World War I due to its safety from attack by enemy land forces and the existence of railway connections with both the northern and southern battlefields. The town was home to 16 hospitals and a convalescent depot, in addition to a number of reinforcement camps for Commonwealth soldiers and general barracks for the French Army. Of more than 11,500 soldiers interred in √âtaples Military Cemetery, over 10,000 of these men were casualties of World War I who died in √âtaples or the surrounding area. The abundance of military infrastructure in √âtaples gave the town a capacity of around 100,000 troops in World War I and made the area a serious target for German aerial bombing raids, from which the town suffered heavily. The combination of withstanding these attacks and giving over their homes to the war effort led to √âtaples being awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1920. The Second World War once again saw Allied hospitals stationed in √âtaples, and with them the reopening of the cemetery to cope with the casualties of another war. 119 men were buried in √âtaples Military Cemetery in World War II, this low number attributable to the fact that the hospitals were only in place from January 1940 until the British withdrawal from the Continent in May of the same year. The cemetery Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, √âtaples Military Cemetery is the largest CWGC cemetery in France, and contains the remains of soldiers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India and Germany. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has only published the number of Commonwealth and German dead buried in √âtaples, although its records for the cemetery note that it contains 'a few war graves of other nationalities'. In total, the cemetery contains 10,792 Commonwealth burials of which only 73 are unidentified. There are also 658 German burials in the cemetery.

The actions drew widespread condemnation from the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia and from within France itself. The French National Assembly described the vandalism as 'barbaric, monstrous and utterly despicable', while French President Jacques Chirac wrote to the Queen to express his 'sincere regrets'.

Today it hosts a variety of general aviation aircraft operations, including a major facility for the restoration of classic military aircraft from the World War II era to flying condition. The airport has an operational control tower and a Category I instrument landing system (ILS) on its main runway. It is considered a general aviation reliever airport to Orlando International Airport. For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2001, the airport had 150,388 aircraft operations, an average of 412 per day: 98% general aviation, 2% air taxi, <1% military and <1% scheduled commercial. There are 206 aircraft based at this airport: 71% single-engine, 22% multi- engine, 4% jet and 3% helicopter. History : For the World War II use of the airport, see: Kissimmee Army Airfield The airport opened in April 1940 by the United States Army Air Forces. Known as Kissimmee Army Airfield, it was used as part of the Air University Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) tactical combat simulation school in Central and Northern Florida. Training was moved to southern California in January 1944, and the military use of the field was phased down. The airfield was closed on 7 July 1945 and returned to civilian use by the end of the year.

First defined in 1989, it is similar to Oja's rule in its formulation and stability, except it can be applied to networks with multiple outputs. The name originates because of the similarity between the algorithm and a hypothesis made by Donald Hebb about the way in which synaptic strengths in the brain are modified in response to experience, i.e., that changes are proportional to the correlation between the firing of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. Theory The GHA combines Oja's rule with the Gram-Schmidt process to produce a learning rule of the form :\\\\,\\\\Delta w_{ij} ~ = ~ \\\\eta\\\\left(y_i x_j - y_i \\\\sum_{k=1}^{i} w_{kj} y_k \\\\right), where defines the synaptic weight or connection strength between the th input and th output neurons, and are the input and output vectors, respectively, and is the learning rate parameter. Derivation In matrix form, Oja's rule can be written :\\\\,\\\\frac{d w(t)}{d t} ~ = ~ w(t) Q - \\\\mathrm{diag} [w(t) Q w(t)^{\\\\mathrm{T}}] w(t), and the Gram- Schmidt algorithm is :\\\\,\\\\Delta w(t) ~ = ~ -\\\\mathrm{lower} [w(t) w(t)^{\\\\mathrm{T}}] w(t), where is any matrix, in this case representing synaptic weights, is the autocorrelation matrix, simply the outer product of inputs, is the function that diagonalizes a matrix, and is the function that sets all matrix elements on or above the diagonal equal to 0. We can combine these equations to get our original rule in matrix form, :\\\\,\\\\Delta w(t) ~ = ~ \\\\eta(t) \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{y}(t) \\\\mathbf{x}(t)^{\\\\mathrm{T}} - \\\\mathrm{LT}[\\\\mathbf{y}(t)\\\\mathbf{y}(t)^{\\\\mathrm{T}}] w(t)\\\\right), where the function sets all matrix elements above the diagonal equal to 0, and note that our output is a linear neuron. Stability and PCA Applications The GHA is used in applications where a self-organizing map is necessary, or where a feature or principal components analysis can be used. Examples of such cases include artificial intelligence and speech and image processing. Its importance comes from the fact that learning is a single-layer process‚Äîthat is, a synaptic weight changes only depending on the response of the inputs and outputs of that layer, thus avoiding the multi-layer dependence associated with the backpropagation algorithm. It also has a simple and predictable trade-off between learning speed and accuracy of convergence as set by the learning rate parameter .

Creation There are many Mongol creation myths. In the most ancient one, the creation of the world is attributed to a Buddhist deity Lama. At the start of time, there was only water, and from the heavens, Lama came down to it holding an iron rod from which he began to stir. As he began to stir the water, the stirring brought about a wind and fire which caused a thickening at the centre of the waters to form the earth. Another narrative also attributes the creation of heaven and earth to a lama who is called Udan. Udan began by separating earth from heaven, and then dividing heaven and earth both into nine stories, and creating nine rivers. After the creation of the earth itself, the first male and female couple were created out of clay. They would become the progenitors of all humanity. In another example the world began as an agitating gas which grew increasingly warm and damp, precipitating a heavy rain that created the oceans. Dust and sand emerged to the surface and became earth. Yet another account tells of the Buddha Sakyamuni searching the surface of the sea for a means to create the earth and spotted a golden frog. From its east side, Buddha pierced the frog through, causing it to spin and face north. From its mouth burst, fire and its rump streamed water. Buddha tossed golden sand on his back which became land. And this was the origin of the five earthly elements, wood and metal from the arrow, and fire, water and sand. These myths date from the 17th century when Yellow Shamanism (Tibetan Buddhism using shamanistic forms) was established in Mongolia. Black Shamanism and White Shamanism from pre-Buddhist times survive only in far-northern Mongolia (around Lake Khuvsgul) and the region around Lake Baikal where Lamaist persecution had not been effective. Deities * Bai-Ulgan and Esege Malan are creator deities. * Ot is the goddess of marriage. * Tung-ak is the patron god of tribal chiefs. * Erlig Khan (Erlik Khan) is the King of the Underworld. * Daichi Tengri is the red god of war to whom enemy soldiers were sometimes sacrificed during battle campaigns. * Zaarin Tengri is a spirit who gives Khorchi (in the Secret History of the Mongols) a vision of a cow mooing \\"Heaven and earth have agreed to make Temujin (later Genghis Khan) the lord of the nation\\". * The sky god Tengri is attested from the Xiongnu of the 2nd century BC. The Xiongnu may not have been Mongol, but Tengri is common to several Central Asian peoples, including the Mongols. The wolf, falcon, deer and horse were important symbolic animals. Texts and myths The Uliger are traditional epic tales and the Epic of King Gesar is shared with much of Central Asia and Tibet. The Epic of King Gesar (Ges'r, Kesar) is a Mongol religious epic about Geser (also known as Buche Beligte), a prophet of Tengriism.
