He was one of the Soviet Union's leading physicists. Alikhanov studied X-rays and cosmic rays before joining the Soviet atomic bomb project. Between 1945 and 1968 he directed the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP) in Moscow, which was named after him in 2004. He led the development of both the first research and the first industrial heavy water reactors in the Soviet Union. They were commissioned in 1949 and 1951, respectively. He was also a pioneer in Soviet accelerator technology. In 1934 he and Igor Kurchatov created a \\"baby cyclotron\\", the first \\"cyclotron\\" operating outside of Berkeley, California. He was the driving force behind the construction of the 70 GeV synchrotron in Serpukhov (1967), the largest in the world at the time. His brother, Artem Alikhanian, was based in Soviet Armenia and led the Yerevan Physics Institute for many years. Early life Alikhanov was born Abraham Alikhanian () on in Elisabethpol (today Ganja, Azerbaijan) to Armenian parents. His father, Isahak Alikhanian (d. 1925), was a railroad engineer (train driver) in the Transcaucasus Railway, while his mother, Yulia Artemevna (n√©e Sulkhanova), was a housewife. His younger brother, Artem Alikhanian (1908‚Äì78), was also a noted physicist. They had two sisters: Araksia (b. 1906) and Ruzanna (b. 1913). His family lived in Alexandropol (today Gyumri) in 1912‚Äì13, where Abram attended a commercial college. The family then moved to Tiflis (today Tbilisi), where they lived until 1918. They again moved to live in Alexandropol until the Turkish‚ÄìArmenian War of 1920. They returned to Tiflis and Abram graduated from a Tiflis commercial college in 1921. He then enrolled in the Polytechnic Institute of Tiflis, but, for the most part, did not study in order to financially support himself and his family. He worked as a cashier and telephone operator. Early career in Leningrad (1927‚Äì41) In 1923 Alikhanov moved to Leningrad and enrolled in the chemistry department of the Polytechnic Institute. In 1924 he transferred to the department of physics and mechanics, founded by Abram Ioffe. Besides Ioffe, other prominent scientists taught there, including Nikolay Semyonov and Yakov Frenkel. In 1925‚Äì27 he worked at the Mechnikov Hospital as a radiographer. He graduated in 1929. He was awarded a PhD in Physical and Mathematical Sciences in 1935. He lectured at the St. Petersburg State Transport University in 1939‚Äì41 and chaired the Department of Physics there. =X-rays (1927‚Äì33)= In 1927 Alikhanov began working part-time at the Physical-Technical Institute in Leningrad as a researcher focusing on X-rays, X-ray diffraction, and solid-state physics. In 1929 he published his first paper on the use of X-ray analysis in investigating the crystal structure of the copper-aluminum alloy. In 1929, after graduating from the Polytechnic Institute, he was employed by the Physical-Technical Institute full-time. He began a long-time collaboration with his younger brother, Artem, and Lev Artsimovich in 1930. Under the supervision of Pyotr Ivanovich Lukirskii, head of the X-ray laboratory, Alikhanov and Artsimovich studied X-ray optics from 1930 to 1933. Results included a \\"study of total internal reflection of X-rays from thin layers of various substances.\\" He showed that aluminum does not undergo allotropic transformation when X-rayed at 550‚Äì600¬∞C. He also did a \\"study of the total internal reflection of X rays from thin layers and the estimation of the depth of their penetration into the medium. Alikhanov also proved that the laws of classical optics can be applied to the reflection of hard X rays.\\" Alikhanov summarized the results in a 1933 monograph titled X-Ray Optics (–û–ø—Ç–∏–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–Ω—Ç–≥–µ–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ª—É—á–µ–π). =Nuclear physics (1933‚Äì41)= Ioffe, Alikhanov and Kurchatov in the early 1930s Alikhanov switched to nuclear physics in 1933, following the discovery of the neutron and the positron in 1932. Abram Ioffe appointed Alikhanov head of the positron laboratory at the Department of Solid-State Physics at the Physical-Technical Institute. His group studied pair production and gamma rays and made observations of positrons using Geiger counters. According to Viktor Frenkel, their work became a \\"starting point for the application of radio engineering to experimental nuclear physics in the Soviet Union.\\" Above wrote that in 1933‚Äì34 Alikhanov and his colleagues were the \\"first to study in detail the spectrum of positrons from external pair conversion over the entire energy range. Among other things, they showed that, in accord with relevant theoretical results, the maximum of the spectrum occurs in the vicinity of the positron energy equal to half the endpoint energy.\\" He added, \\"those investigations made it possible to reveal gamma lines that had previously been unknown, whereby it was possible to reconstruct the diagrams of decays of excited nuclei.\\" They went on to study beta decay using not the usual Wilson cloud chamber, but a spectrometer developed by Alikhanov and Mikhail Kozodayev. It was a \\"radically improved\\" version of the \\"classical magnetic spectrometer with transverse field, fitting it with a system of coincidence- coupled gas-discharge counters. The use of this registration system was an important methodological novelty. It opened the way to development of Soviet nuclear electronics, which has been advanced in many of its aspects by Alikhanov's students. The new magnetic spectrometer was capable of registering the comparatively infrequent processes of positron production and could be used to investigate their energy spectra, the dependence of positron yield on Œ≥-quantum energy and on the atomic number of the element, etc.\\" In 1934 Alikhanov and Igor Kurchatov built a \\"baby cyclotron\\", which became the first \\"cyclotron\\" operating outside of Berkeley, California where Ernest Lawrence had invented it years earlier. It did not operate for long, though some experiments were conducted. The first proper cyclotron in the Soviet Union was built at the Radium Institute in Leningrad by 1936. Alikhanov \\"discovered that positrons were present even in the absence of a converter made from a heavy element, and this led him to the discovery of a new phenomenon‚Äîproduction of an electron-positron pair as a result of internal conversion of the energy of the excited nucleus.\\" This was later used in nuclear spectroscopy. Alikhanov's group also studied scattering of fast electrons in matter and beta spectra of radioactive substances. In 1938 Alikhanov discovered a new method of determining the rest mass of the neutrino using decay of the nuclei of 7Be. Cosmic rays (1941‚Äì42) Alikhanov planned to study cosmic rays, the only source of high-energy particles known at that time, in the Pamir Mountains in the summer of 1941, however, due to the approaching Nazi forces, Alikhanov and the Institute for Physical Problems were evacuated to Kazan in October 1941. In April 1942 he moved to Yerevan, Soviet Armenia with the intention to study cosmic rays at Mount Aragats. The expedition to Aragats resulted in the discovery of the \\"presence of an intense group of protons with comparatively small energies in the soft cosmic-radiation component\\" and \\"presence of a stream of fast protons in cosmic radiation.\\" Alikhanov and his group, including his brother Artem Alikhanian, also erroneously concluded in the existence of cosmic radiation particles, called by them varitrons, which supposedly possessed a broad spectrum of masses. Alikhanov-Alikhanian brothers were widely criticized for the claim. Turkevich noted in 1956 that \\"this claim was questioned in the West and attacked by a group of Soviet physicists, with a subsequent bitter polemic in the Soviet physics journals. The controversy has never been settled officially, and Soviet cosmic ray research has suffered a lack of prestige.\\" Career in Moscow (1942‚Äì68) After returning to Russia from Armenia, Alikhanov worked at the Institute for Physical Problems in Moscow from 1944 to 1946. Between 1947 and 1951 Alikhanov headed the Department of Structure of Matter at the Faculty of Physics and Technology of Moscow State University. He helped organize the Nuclear Physics Division of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Among Alikhanov's students were Boris S. Dzhelepov, Venedikt P. Dzhelepov, Mikhail S. Kozodaev, Sergey Ya. Nikitin, Pyotr E. Spivak. =Atomic bomb project= Alikhanov was involved in the Soviet atomic bomb project. After the Soviet authorities learned of the German, British and American programs of nuclear weapons in mid-1942, works began on the Soviet project led by Igor Kurchatov. At Laboratory no. 2, Alikhanov was assigned to develop a nuclear pile with heavy water. Lev Artsimovich, Isaak Kikoin, and Anatoly Alexandrov worked on electromagnetic isotope separation, gaseous diffusion process and thermal diffusion process, respectively. While Alikhanov led the research on the construction of a heavy- water reactor. In August 1945 the Special Committee under the Council of Ministers (Council of People's Commissars) was formed to oversee works on uranium. Lavrentiy Beria was named it head. The Scientific-Technical Council was headed by Boris Vannikov and included Alikhanov (initially as it scientific secretary), Igor Kurchatov, Pyotr Kapitsa, Abram Ioffe and others. =ITEP= The Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP) in Moscow On December 1, 1945 Laboratory no. 3 of the Soviet Academy of Sciences was established in Moscow with Alikhanov as its head. The laboratory was renamed to Heat-Engineering Laboratory (–¢–µ–ø–ª–æ—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –ª–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è) in 1949 and received its modern name, the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP), in 1958. Alikhanov lead the institute for 23 years, until he retired in 1968. Lev Landau and his student Isaak Pomeranchuk headed the theory division of the institute in 1945‚Äì46 and 1946‚Äì66, respectively. At ITEP, Alikhanov led research on and advanced scintillation techniques, bubble chambers, and spark chambers. Nuclear reactor The laboratory/institute initially focused on what Alikhanov had already begun working on: construction of a nuclear reactor based on heavy water. With a small staff, Alikhanov led the design of the first reactor by 1947. It was built in 1948 and successfully put into operation on April 25, 1949. Alikhanov was personally heavily involved in the project. He solved all the \\"physical and technical problems that arose in construction of the reactor,\\" and tackled the \\"dirtiest jobs without hesitation; thus the reactor was for the most part his creature.\\" It was the first heavy-water research reactor in the USSR. A number of studies and discoveries were done based on it. It was shut down in 1987. The reactor was not invented for nuclear power generation, but instead for experiments that would advance the design and construction of other reactors. In 1959 Alikhanov led the design of 10 MW experimental research heavy-water reactors, which were built in China and Yugoslavia under his supervision. Alikhanov also led the project of design the first industrial heavy-water reactor in the Soviet Union. Named OK-180, it was commissioned in October 1951 in Chelyabinsk-65. Its heat exchangers froze shortly after it began operating. It was decommissioned in 1965 and subsequently disassembled. Until the end of his career, Alikhanov \\"remained a renowned head and a strong advocate\\" of heavy- water reactors, though graphite-moderated reactors were given the preference for their price. Accelerators By 1952, after the completion of the heavy-water reactor, the main direction of Alikhanov's institute became construction of a high-energy accelerator. A proton accelerator with a strong focusing of 7 GeV (gigaelectronvolt) was completed and commissioned at the institute in 1961. The accelerator made it possible to conduct research on elementary particle physics on a broader scale at ITEP. Alikhanov led several studies and investigations based on the new instrument, most notably research on \\"pion scattering on nucleons with large momentum transfer.\\" The 7-GeV accelerator served as a prototype or an operating model for the 70-GeV accelerator in Serpukhov, which was advanced by Alikhanov. Alikhanov \\"became a motive force behind construction of the Serpukhov accelerator.\\" Alikhanov and his team participated in its design. The Serpukhov accelerator was commissioned in 1967 and became the largest proton accelerator in the world at the time. Mikhail Shifman noted that Alikhanov was the \\"driving force behind the decision to build the first strong focusing accelerators\\" in the Soviet Union: at ITEP and at IHEP in Protvino, near Serpukhov. The Serpukhov accelerator, construction on which had begun in 1960, was transferred to the Institute for High Energy Physics (IHEP). Abov noted that the decision by the Ministry of Defense was an \\"irreparable blow\\" for Alikhanov, because it \\"deprived the institute of any prospects for further development.\\" The Ministry had alleged that the construction of the accelerator was slow, however, according to Abov, the Ministry had made a decision to transfer it to the IHEP from the very beginning. Parity violation Between 1957 and 1960, following the Wu experiment, Alikhanov oversaw the research on parity violation in beta decay. Studies led by him confirmed Wu's findings and explored the structure of weak interaction. Alikhanov was the first Soviet physicist to investigate it. He measured the longitudinal polarization of electrons in Œ≤ decay. Personal life and death Alikhanov was known to his family and friends as \\"Abusha\\" (–ê–±—É—à–∞). His colleagues and students wrote that he was \\"extremely straightforward and generous in his dealings with people, irrespective of whether the matter was a scientific or a merely personal problem.\\" He was described as \\"hot-tempered.\\" Alikhanov married twice. He had two children with his first wife, Anna Grigorievna Prokofieva, who he married in 1925. His son, Ruben, was a physicist, while his daughter, Seda, was a writer. His second wife, Slava Solomonovna Roshal (b. 1916) was a violinist. They had two children: Tigran (b. 1943), a pianist, and Yevgenia (b. 1949), a violinist. Tigran served as rector (president) of the Moscow Conservatory in 2005‚Äì09. Alikhanov suffered a stroke in 1964. He resigned from his post as director of the ITEP in 1968. Alikhanov died in Moscow on December 8, 1970 at the age of 66. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Relationship with the Communist Party Alikhanov never joined the Communist Party. According to his colleague Boris L. Ioffe, Alikhanov \\"did not like the Soviet regime\\" and was \\"fairly outspoken.\\" He told his colleagues that Lavrentiy Beria was a \\"dreadful person\\" before Beria's downfall and was the only major physicist who visited Pyotr Kapitsa when he was sent into exile near Moscow on Stalin's orders. Alikhanov later signed a collective letter addressed to the Soviet leaders asking them to return Kapitsa to the head of the Institute for Physical Problems. He did not collaborate with the authorities during the antisemitic rootless cosmopolitanism and the Doctors' plot campaign in the post-war years when Jews were fired from their workplaces. Abov noted that Alikhanov protected his colleagues during the campaign, though \\"of course, there were victims, but he was able to minimize them.\\" In October 1955 Alikhanov was among a number of leading Soviet scientists who signed the \\"Letter of 300\\" criticizing Trofim Lysenko. In 1956 Alikhanov came under pressure when several members of the ITEP staff gave pro- democracy speeches at the institute's Communist Party organization. The party organization was disbanded. Alikhanov had a meeting with Khrushchev and the latter told him that he sought to prevent the arrest of the dissidents. In his turn, Alikhanov told the dissidents: \\"If you knew what you were doing, you're heroes. If you didn't, you're fools.\\" Yuri Orlov, one of the dissidents who was forced to leave ITEP, found work at the Yerevan Physics Institute, headed by Artem Alikhanian, Alikhanov's brother. Orlov noted that after Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956, Alikhanov was among \\"some 20-30 leading physicists\\" who \\"were very active in writing collective letters (not for publication, of course) to the [Soviet] leaders protesting attempts to restore or protect Stalinism\\" when \\"the majority of scientists [...] were afraid to participate in such activity.\\" In March 1966 he joined Pyotr Kapitsa, Andrei Sakharov and others calling on Leonid Brezhnev not to rehabilitate Stalin. Recognition The Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics, which Alikhanov led from its inception in 1945 until 1968, was named after Alikhanov in 2004. Alikhanov is widely recognized as one of the leading Soviet physicists. A 1974 obituary in Soviet Physics Uspekhi called Alikhanov \\"one of the founders of nuclear physics in our country.\\" Mikhail Shifman described Alikhanov as the founder of experimental nuclear and particle physics in the Soviet Union, along with Igor Kurchatov, and one of the \\"fathers\\" of Soviet particle physics, along with Lev Landau and Isaak Pomeranchuk. In a November 1945 letter to Stalin, Pyotr Kapitsa wrote: \\"Comrades Alikhanov, Ioffe, and Kurchatov are as competent as I or even more so.\\" Yuri Orlov opined that Alikhanov \\"was not such a genius as Landau or Kapitsa. But he was a distinguished scientist and honest man who gathered in his institute the same kind of men, and transmitted to us students his awesomely high standards.\\" According to Abov, Alikhanov's research in 1933‚Äì40 \\"were at the highest scientific level worthy of a Nobel prize.\\" The Armenian artist Martiros Sarian, a friend of his, painted a portrait of Alikhanov. =Honors= ;Awards *Stalin Prize/USSR State Prize (1941, 1948, 1953) *Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1964) *Order of Lenin (1945, 1953) *Hero of Socialist Labor (1954) ;Membership *Corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences: January 1939 *Full member (Academician) of the Soviet Academy of Sciences: 27 September 1943 *Full member (Academician) of the Armenian Academy of Sciences: 1943 *Foreign member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (1962) References ;Notes ;Citations Further reading PDF version 1904 births 1970 deaths Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences Soviet nuclear physicists Armenian nuclear physicists Russian nuclear physicists Scientists from Ganja, Azerbaijan People from Elisabethpol Governorate Azerbaijani Armenians Armenian inventors Soviet inventors 20th-century scientists Soviet physicists 20th-century physicists Recipients of the USSR State Prize Soviet Armenians Armenian scientists Armenian physicists Stalin Prize winners ","title":"Abram Alikhanov"},{"id":"18594589","text":"Vidya Prasarak Mandal, Thane, Maharashtra, India was established in 1935.

He chaired the inquiry into the Bradford City stadium fire, presided over the libel case brought by Jonathan Aitken MP against The Guardian newspaper which eventually led to Aitken's imprisonment for perjury, and was widely reported for asking \\"What is Linford's lunchbox?\\" during a case over which he was presiding, brought by Linford Christie. He played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and was president of the Marylebone Cricket Club from 1994-96. He wrote a book about his legal career. Personal life Popplewell's father was a civil servant. He is the father of four sons, the eldest of whom is the former Cambridge University and Somerset cricketer and now solicitor, Nigel Popplewell, and another of whom, Andrew Popplewell, is now a Lord Justice of Appeal. He has 13 grandchildren among whom are the actresses Anna Popplewell and Lulu Popplewell. A widower, Sir Oliver married Dame Elizabeth Gloster in March 2008. He is the godfather of Stephen Fry. Education Popplewell went to Charterhouse School as a scholar, where he played cricket with Peter May and future politician Jim Prior, and after spending two years of National Service in the Royal Navy, he went to Queens' College, Cambridge as an exhibitioner. He was awarded a BA degree in 1950 and an LL.B. in 1951. In 2003, Popplewell became one of the oldest mature students at the University of Oxford when he started reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Harris Manchester College. Cricket Popplewell was a right-handed wicket-keeper- batsman, playing 56 innings in 41 matches, scoring 881 runs for an average of 20.46 including two half-centuries.Oliver Popplewell at cricinfo.com He played for Cambridge University from 1949-51 at the time when the Rev David Sheppard was playing for the university, for MCC in 1953 and for the Free Foresters from 1952-60. His sole bowling stint was three ballsop cit. for MCC against Cambridge University in 1953. He was president of the MCC from 1994-96. Legal career Popplewell was called to the bar in 1951. He became a Queen's Counsel in 1969. After serving as Recorder of Burton upon Trent and Deputy Chairman of Oxfordshire Quarter Sessions, he was appointed as Recorder of the Crown Court in 1971. He was a High Court judge from 1983 until 2003. During this time, he chaired the Bradford Inquiry into Crowd Control and Safety at Sports Grounds in 1985. He was a judge of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, vice-chairman of the Parole Board, and a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators. Cases In 1975 he defended his godson Stephen Fry, who was 18 at the time, at his trial for credit card fraud. Popplewell and his wife had long been friends of Fry's parents. Stephen Fry writes about the event in his autobiography Moab Is My Washpot. Following the fire at Valley Parade, the Bradford City stadium, on 11 May 1985, Popplewell was chosen to chair an inquiry held under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. Following this inquiry, he was chosen to chair a Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds. In 1999, he donated the papers of the inquiry to the University of Bradford. A copy of the Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds' Interim Report is published online in PDF format by the Bradford City Fire website.Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds' Interim Report, bradfordcityfire.co.uk, 29 September 2012; accessed 7 April 2016. He presided over the libel case brought by Jonathan Aitken against The Guardian and Granada Television. While presiding over the High Court case brought by the athlete Linford Christie against former criminal John McVicar, the editor of Spike magazine, he was widely reported as asking, \\"What is Linford's lunchbox?\\". He later claimed that this was intended as a joke.Legal legend and the 'lunchbox' question, business.timesonline.co.uk, 20 May 2003. The question was in the tradition of British jurisprudence, in which the judge asks seemingly inane questions relevant to the facts of the case on the assumption that the jury, which cannot ask questions, is ignorant of them. Following this case, the name \\"Mr Justice Cocklecarrot\\" was revived by Private Eye magazine (it was originally the name of a character in the Beachcomber column in the Daily Express) which became the magazine's generic name for unworldly and out-of-touch judges, though Popplewell asserts that this description did not apply to him.The real world of Oliver Popplewell, guardian.co.uk, 20 May 2003. He upheld Reynolds Defence, established in the House of Lords in Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd in 1999, in an action against the Yorkshire Post for reporting that a local karate company was selling \\"rip-off\\" lessons. Since his retirement, Popplewell has spoken up for the right of judges to impose the sentences they see fit. He had an argument with Home Secretary David Blunkett who was seeking to introduce mandatory minimum sentences for some serious crimes.Blunkett branded 'a whiner', bbc.co.uk, 14 May 2003. Hillsborough controversy and the Bradford City stadium fire developments On 19 October 2011 he sparked fury by calling on the Liverpool families involved in the Hillsborough disaster to behave more like the relatives of victims of the Bradford City stadium disaster. He made the comments in a letter to The Times following the Commons debate on 17 October 2011 calling for all Cabinet papers on Hillsborough to be released. He said: \\"The citizens of Bradford behaved with quiet dignity and great courage. They did not harbour conspiracy theories. They did not seek endless further inquiries\\". His letter was published by the Times sister paper, The Sun, which is boycotted on Merseyside, the day after it was revealed to Parliament that senior policemen had changed the evidence of junior policemen whose evidence contradicted the official version given to the press by police spokesmen. Popplewell was widely criticised for his comments, including a rebuke from a survivor of the Bradford stadium disaster. In April 2015 Popplewell expressed the view that it was \\"bizarre\\" to suggest that the Bradford City stadium fire was anything other than accidental. This was in response to the publication of an article in The Guardian newspaper of an extract from a new book \\"Fifty-Six: The Story of the Bradford Fire\\" by Martin Fletcher, revealing new information about 8 previous fires allegedly connected to the Bradford City owner and chairman, Stafford Heginbotham (who died in 1995), Popplewell later qualified his remark and suggested that the police should look into the ‚Äúremarkable number‚Äù of fires allegedly connected to Bradford City‚Äôs then chairman ‚Äúto see if there was anything sinister‚Äù. He had earlier said that he remained convinced that the fire was ‚Äúundoubtedly‚Äù started by accident by a discarded match or cigarette, despite the new evidence.

After leaving the Kalins, in 1958, he wrote \\"Ev'ry Hour, Ev'ry Day of My Life\\", a hit for Malcolm Vaughan, and Frankie Avalon's Top Ten hit \\"Ginger Bread\\". Ballard's own recording career was less successful. In addition to recording several singles under his own name without much success, in 1960 he adopted the alias Buddy Clinton to cut a two-sided single featuring the songs \\"Take Me to Your Ladder (I'll See Your Leader Later)\\" and \\"Joanie's Forever\\", both co- written by then-unknown composer Burt Bacharach with his writing partner Bob Hilliard. Ballard wrote one of his most successful songs in 1963, \\"You're No Good\\", which was first recorded by Dee Dee Warwick. A competing version recorded by Betty Everett appeared weeks later and was a bigger hit, reaching the Top Ten of the US Billboard R&B; chart. A year later, the British group The Swinging Blue Jeans also recorded \\"You're No Good\\". Linda Ronstadt's version hit number one on the Billboard chart in 1975. Ballard's songs were often recorded by artists of the British Invasion. The Swinging Blue Jeans recorded \\"It Isn't There\\". In 1966, the Zombies recorded his \\"Gotta Get a Hold of Myself\\". Ballard wrote \\"I'm Alive\\" for The Hollies, which was number one in the UK Singles Chart in 1965. One of Ballard's best-known songs, \\"The Game of Love\\", was recorded by Manchester-based Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders in 1965. The single went hit number one in the US and peaked at number two in the UK. Ballard also wrote the subsequent Mindbenders' chart singles \\"Just a Little Bit Too Late\\" and \\"She Needs Love\\". Ballard later wrote songs for the Ricky Nelson film, Love and Kisses. He also wrote a series of commercial jingles, including a theme for Greyhound Lines. He died in Denton, Texas, in December 2008, two years after suffering a stroke. He is not to be confused with fellow songwriters Russ Ballard, Glen Ballard or Hank Ballard.

He was the first child of Stoencho Stambologlu, a teacher, and his wife, Dafina. On August 14, 1852, at the vigil of the Assumption of Mary, he was arrested because he helped the priest to use the new Semantron. At the request of influential Christians living in Kazanlak he was released. After this event he started thinking about a free Bulgaria. He began his post-secondary education in Kazanlak and in 1858 transferred to the Imperial Medical School in Istanbul, which trained surgeons for the Ottoman army. It was during this time that his interest in infectious diseases began. While still a student he helped treat victims of the Istanbul cholera epidemic of 1865.Yildirim, N., and Ulman, Y.I., \\"Great Cholera Epidemic of Istanbul in 1865\\" describes the epidemic but doesn't mention Stambolski. In 1867 Istanbul saw an outbreak of typhus and for his work during this epidemic he was awarded the Turkish Medjidie-Medal. He became well-known in Istanbul and knew many influential persons. He then used this as an opportunity to take a role in the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian church. He was a member of the temporary counsel of the Bulgarian Exarchate and president of the Bulgarian chitalishte in Istanbul. He worked not only with the supporters of the church struggle, including Ilarion Makariopolski, but also with the revolutionaries Georgi Rakovski and Vassil Levski. In 1877 he was exiled to Yemen, where he described the disease Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease).–•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ –°—Ç–∞–º–±–æ–ª—Å–∫–∏: –ê–≤—Ç–æ–±–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è, –¥–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–∏—Ü–∏ –∏ —Å–ø–æ–º–µ–Ω–∏.

While the album is not perfect, it shows some very exciting potential in very substantial present work. The album's most commercial cut is the opening 'It's a Jungle Out There' which has a different producer ‚Äì and feel ‚Äì than the rest of the album. It's more appealing, but less cerebral than the rest of the album, just as it was intended.\\" Another review stated: \\"Its sound is high- tech, pulsing and snappy, notably in 'It's a Jungle Out There.' The group is heavy on repetitious rhythms and light on substance, despite its claims otherwise.\\" As well as rating it 2¬Ω stars.

He emigrated to the United States at the age of twenty-four. Early life The Rhead family had operated and worked in the Staffordshire Potteries for at least three generations. Louis' father George W. Rhead worked in the pottery industry and was a highly respected gilder and ceramic artist. In the 1870s, George Rhead taught art and design in Staffordshire schools. He founded Fenton School of Art. The Quartier Latin: a magazine devoted to the arts. Advertising poster ca. 1895 Rhead in his studio circa 1920 Rhead exhibition in Salon des Cent, 1897 Read The Sun. 1900 \\"Fly fishing\\", a book-plate by Louis Rhead Louis and all his siblings attended their father's art classes and worked in the potteries as children. His brothers Frederick Alfred Rhead and George Woolliscroft Rhead Jr. (1855‚Äì1920) were also artistic, and Louis, later in his career, sometimes collaborated with them, for example in book-illustration projects. Louis was also the uncle of the potters Charlotte Rhead and Frederick Hurten Rhead. Because Louis demonstrated exceptional talent, when he was thirteen in 1872, his father sent him to study in Paris, France with artist Gustave Boulanger. After three years in Paris, Louis Rhead returned to work in the potteries as a ceramic artist at Minton and later at Wedgwood. In 1879 he gained a scholarship at the National Art Training School, South Kensington, London. After graduating from South Kensington in 1881, Louis Rhead worked briefly for Wedgwood and worked for the London publisher Cassell. U.S. career In 1883 at the age of twenty-four, Louis Rhead was offered a position as Art Director for the U.S. publishing firm of D. Appleton in New York City. He accepted and emigrated to the U.S. in the fall of 1883. In 1884 he married Catherine Bogart Yates, thus becoming an American citizen. Louis and Catherine lived in Flatbush, Brooklyn overlooking Prospect Park for forty years. In the early 1890s, Rhead became a prominent poster artist and was heavily influenced by the work of Swiss artist Eug√®ne Grasset. During the poster craze of the early 1890s, Rhead's poster art appeared regularly in Harper's Bazaar, Harper's Magazine, St. Nicolas, Century Magazine, Ladies Home Journal and Scribner's Magazine. In 1895 he won a Gold Medal for Best American Poster Design at the first International Poster Show in Boston. By the late 1890s, the popularity of poster art declined, and Rhead turned his skills to book illustration. Between 1902 and his death in 1926, Rhead illustrated numerous children's books published by Harpers and others. Most notable among these were editions of: Robin Hood, The Swiss Family Robinson, Robinson Crusoe, The Deerslayer, Treasure Island, Kidnapped and Heidi. Angling Rhead was an avid fly fisher and by his own account started fishing for trout in the U.S. sometime between 1888 and 1890. In 1901 he became interested in angling art and much of his later published works deal with fishing and fly fishing. Rhead was also a tackle dealer and sold his own line of artificial flies. His most famous and celebrated work is American Trout-Stream Insects (1916). At the time of its publication this was one of the first and most comprehensive studies of stream entomology ever published in America. Paul Schullery in American Fly Fishing‚ÄîA History (1987) says this about Rhead: > Louis Rhead was one of the most creative, fresh-thinking, and stimulating of > American fly-fishing writers, a man of extraordinary gifts. ... his major > effort was American Trout Stream Insects, a book based on several years of > trout fishing in the Catskills. Death Louis Rhead's death was somewhat unusual. He died from a heart attack at his retirement home in Amityville, Long Island. A portion of his obituary in The New York Times, Friday July 30, 1926: Exhibition Bernard Bumpus (1921‚Äì2004) was the leading authority on the Rhead family. In the 1980s Bumpus curated an exhibition Rhead Artists and Potters at the Geffrye Museum in London, which mainly featured works of art by the Rhead family, but also included examples of Louis Rhead's flies. It toured several UK Museums including the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery in Staffordshire. Bumpus hoped to take a version of the exhibition to the US, but, despite American interest in the Rhead family, this project foundered.Bernard Bumpus obituary, The Times London.

It was erected between Herndon in Northumberland County and Port Trevorton in Snyder County, Pennsylvania. The bridge was long, with a trestle leading up to it. It was originally built as a railroad bridge by the Trevorton and Susquehanna Railroad and, in 1885, the bridge was adapted for use as a road bridge as well as for trains. The bridge was most often used to cross the Susquehanna by cattle. The continuous crossing of cattle endangered the already weakened bridge (weakened from acid in the bark the pine used to construct the bridge).

She is the subject of many folk ballads and poems written since her time down to the present day. She fought in the Battle of Ballynahinch against the Yeomanry, and was killed in retreat along with her brother and lover, having her right hand cut off before being decapitated. Young David Maguire,(aka. Davy Mags) also from the Ballynahinch area, runs a fan club in her honour to this very day. She is a folk hero to both loyalists and republicans in Ulster, as typified by the centenary celebrations in 1898 where locals broke a monument to her sooner than let Nationalists, who travelled from Belfast, have a ceremony in her honour.Bartlett/Dawson/Keough: Thomas Bartlett, Kevin Dawson, Daire Keogh, The 1798 Rebellion: An Illustrated History, Roberts Rinehart, 1998, p.172Guy Beiner, Forgetful Remembrance: Social Forgetting and Vernacular Historiography of a Rebellion in Ulster (Oxford University Press, 2018), pp. 369-384 Betsy Gray's story still excites interest to the present day because the Enlightenment inspired United Irish movement is a pivotal episode, perhaps the pivotal, in the history of Ireland. It immediately resonates with the instincts of the common person for a better world. Betsy Gray acted so heroically for a reason. The United Irish movement at its best was resolutely non-sectarian and blind to religious affiliation. More than that it in many ways actively championed opposition to religious obscurantism per se, in tune with the radical Enlightenment. Betsy Gray in fiction  Betsy was featured in a novel which was semi-historical by Wesley Greenhill Lyttle, owner of a local newspaper The North Down Herald, and in a historic novel called The Star Man by Conor O'Clery, published in 2016 by Somerville Press.

Composed in Moscow in 1926‚Äì27, it was inspired by Alexander Pushkin's poem The Bronze Horseman, which tells of a young man whose fianc√©e is drowned by the disastrous flooding of Saint Petersburg by the River Neva in 1824 and who curses the prominent equestrian statue of Peter the Great, only to be pursued through the city by the statue until he too is drowned. The basic events of the poem may be discerned in Myaskovsky‚Äôs music, notably the flood in the opening passage (marked Tumultuoso), plus themes for the principal characters (the sole lyrical element, played Patetico on solo woodwind or violin, symbolizes the drowned fianc√©e) and the pursuit by the statue, a Presto Tempestoso fugue on a subject using ten of the twelve pitches of the chromatic scale. In fact Myaskovsky was not so much inspired by the poem as by Alexander Benois's illustrations to it.

Myaskovsky commented that the symphony was \\"filled with the deafening racket of four trumpets, eight horns and so on\\" and described it to Sergei Prokofiev as being \\"as massive as if it were made of iron\\". The premiere was given in Moscow on 2 April 1928 by the conductorless orchestra Persimfans, but the complexity of the music defeated them.

The New Zealand Agency for International Development funded a pilot scheme to turn animal waste into energy and fertilizer. According to the NZAID website, the project is \\"designed to bring substantial economic and environmental benefits to the people of Landhi\\". The purpose of the project was not only to curb the \\"pollution problem caused by animal waste, but also to lift the living standards and improve the environment of the local people.\\"‚ÄòWaste to energy' project launched in Pakistan NZAID History The Landhi Dairy Colony (LDC) is located in the suburbs of Karachi. It was established in 1958 within an area of for 15,000 animals. Today, it has about 1,500 farms spread over . It has a dairy animal population of about 400,000 (around 95% buffaloes and 5% cows, as well as an unknown number of sheep and goats), with a daily yield of about four million litres of milk and 7,200 tones of dung, making it world's largest dairy colony. Buffaloes are the biggest source of milk here, just as they are in rest of Pakistan. Individual farmers often own up to 200 animals each. The majority of the milking animals in LDC are kept only for one lactation phase and consequently approximately 10 to 12 percent of the population is replaced every month. After the lactation period, the majority of the animals are sold to breeders or for slaughter and only a few are kept by the dairy farmers for re-breeding. Most of the animals are brought to and from the animal rich districts of Punjab and Sindh. Waste to energy project The first gobar (cow dung) gas-fired power plant (25 MW) in Landhi Bhains Colony is on the cards. This will not only take care of a part of the colony's dung - turning a negative feature into a positive one - but also yield 1,500 tons of natural fertilizer daily. The project will resolve a significant environmental problem and simultaneously produce badly needed electricity in the city of Karachi, which is an immediate and pressing need. The importance and scale of the project is underscored by the inauguration of the project by H.E. Mr. Phil Goff, Minister for Trade of the Government of New Zealand together with the Karachi City Nazim, Syed Mustafa Kamal. On 15 April 2007, the inauguration of a project to convert the animal waste to fuel and fertilizer took place. The cattle produce 7,200 tons of waste per day; the lack of treatment caused enormous problems. The project prevented the dumping of waste in the sea and instead used the dung to produce methane gas for power generation (25 MW) as well as producing 1,400 tons of dried fertilizer per day.INAUGURATION_OF_LANDHI_CATTLE_COLONY_WASTE Syed Feroz Shah, the director of the National Engineer Corporation in a joint briefing with Tony Woods and Ann McLean of Empower Consultants said it was the second ever Carbon credit project for Pakistan.

He was a close associate of the republic's founding father, Sun Yat-sen, an active member of the Kuomintang (\\"Chinese Nationalist Party\\"), and a judge on the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Hague. Early life Wang was born in Hong Kong in 1881, and graduated in 1900 from Peiyang University (later merged with Tianjin University) where he studied law. After briefly teaching at Nanyang Public School, in 1901 he continued his study in Japan, and later traveled to the United States attending the University of California, Berkeley and Yale University. He received the degree of Doctor of Civil Law from Yale Law School in 1905. Wang was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1907. In the same year, his translation of the German Civil Code (of 1896) into English was published. During 1907 and 1911, he studied comparative law in Germany and France. He returned to China from London in the autumn of 1911, and when the anti-dynastic Xinhai Revolution of October 10 began, he became adviser to Chen Qimei, the revolutionary military governor of Shanghai. He represented Guangdong at the Nanking convention which elected Dr. Sun Yat-sen provisional president of the Republic of China. Shanghai In 1912, Wang was designated first minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of China. After the rise of Yuan Shih-k'ai, Wang was named minister of justice in the cabinet of T'ang Shao-yi. He participated in drafting the republic's provisional constitution of 1912. Tang resigned in June 1912, and a month later Wang did the same. He moved to Shanghai and assumed the roles of vice-chancellor of Futan University and chief editor of the Chunghua Book Company. Guangzhou Though he stayed out of some major political events during the early anti-Yuan era, in May 1916 he became deputy commissioner for foreign affairs of the military council in Canton, headed by Liang Ch'i-ch'ao and Ts'ai O. Wang served as chief justice of the Chinese supreme court in 1920 and justice minister of the \\"Peking\\" or \\"northern\\" government of Li Yuan-hung in June 1922. He briefly served as acting prime minister from September to November 1922. It was amid continued political power struggles and warlord rivalries that Wang gladly accepted an appointment as deputy judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Hage from 1923‚Äì1925. Beijing Wang Ch'ung-hui talks about the Sino-Japanese relationship with Japanese reporters as Foreign Minister of the Republic of China in March 1937. Wang returned to Peking in 1925. In 1926, he was elected to the Central Supervisory Committee of the northern government and he also briefly served as minister of education under prime minister W.W. Yen. In mid-1927, he left Peking and joined Chiang Kai-shek's Nanking government, serving as justice minister. He was fundamental in formulating the principles underlying the Republic of China's criminal and civil codes. When the Judicial Yuan was created in 1928, Wang was its first president. He retained that post, and became a member of the State Council, from 1928‚Äì31. During these years, he worked to rid China of the extraterritoriality imposed by European powers and Japan. A loyal follower of Sun Yat-sen, Wang also worked to move China into the \\"political tutelage\\" phase of the revolution which would pave the way for China to become a constitutional democracy. In 1930, Wang was elected judge on the Permanent Court of International Justice, but he delayed his acceptance as he was guiding the process of drawing up the provisional constitution of 1931. He assumed his post in the Hague in 1931, and served out his term until 1936. He returned to China that year and was seen as a moderating influence in Nanking during the Xi'an Incident in December of that year. Wang Ch'ung-hui served as foreign minister from March 1937 - April 1941, a painful time during which Japanese invasion would kill millions of Chinese civilians and force the ROC government to relocate from Nanking to a provisional capital in Chungking. On August 21, 1937, he signed the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact with Soviet foreign minister Bogomoloff. This guaranteed the Soviet Union's financial support to the Kuomintang government, though they continued supporting Communist insurgents too. In 1942, Wang became secretary general of the Chinese Supreme Defense Council. In this capacity, he accompanied President Chiang Kai-shek to India in 1942 and the Cairo Conference in 1943. In 1943, he also began serving on the People's Political Council. Taipei Dr. Wang was a member of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945. Upon his return to China, he served as director of the Far Eastern Branch Committee of the Commission for the Investigation of Pacific War Crimes. Wang then worked on the framing of the constitution of the Republic of China, which was promulgated on January 1, 1947. In 1948, he was elected member of the Academia Sinica and once again became minister of justice. When mainland China fell to the Communist Party of China in 1949, Wang relocated to Taipei, Taiwan. Upon his resettlement in Taiwan, Wang served on the Kuomintang's Central Reform Committee and its successor, the Central Advisory Committee. He continued to serve as president of the Judicial Yuan until his death on March 15, 1958. His son, Wang Da-hong, was an important Taiwanese architect, regarded as one of the pioneers of modernist architecture in Taiwan.

He is best known as the co-founder and co-artistic director of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company. Early years The second son of an Italian-Jewish family, Zane was born in the Bronx, New York on September 26, 1948. Zane graduated from Binghamton University (SUNY) with a degree in theater and art history. Not long afterward, Zane began pursuing an interest in photography. Though he is best known for being a dancer and choreographer, Zane began his career as a photographer. Zane was immensely interested in the human body, particularly its gestures, its movement, and its essence. Critic Jeffrey Green has characterized Zane‚Äôs portraits as ‚Äúbreaking down boundaries of race and age‚Äù. Zane's exploration of these themes is evidenced in his famous pictorials of a dancing Bill T. Jones. He met Jones, the man who would later become his lifelong partner, while visiting his Alma mater. The story goes that the 22-year-old Zane was immediately enamored of Bill T. Jones (a freshman studying dance and theater at SUNY) when he spied him across campus in 1971. During that spring semester, Zane convinced Jones to travel to Amsterdam with him and explore their burgeoning romantic relationship. After living and working together in Amsterdam, Zane and Jones eventually returned to New York City. Career in Dance and Choreography Zane‚Äôs interest in dance began when he and Jones took Lois Welk‚Äôs contact improvisation class at SUNY/Brockport. Welk‚Äôs improvisational workshop stressing the physical interdependence between dancers, fascinated Zane and sparked his passion for dance. The three (Zane, Jones, Welk) collaborated and formed the American Dance Asylum which was heavily influenced by the work of experimental dancers of the time, namely Yvonne Rainer and other members of Grand Union. Zane‚Äôs photographic interest in the body and his interest in visual design shaped his approach to choreography. Zane and Jones would utilize their physical differences (Zane was short and white, and moved with an agitated energy; Jones was tall and black, and moved with a generous grace) to create an image that was beautiful in its oddity. Their pieces would fuse Jones' power and grace with Zane‚Äôs quick and wiry movement. Indeed, the still pictures of their dances together are especially striking and memorable. After touring internationally for two years as a modern dance duo with the American Dance Asylum, they formed the Bill T. Jones-Arnie Zane Company in 1982. The next year, their company would appear at the Next Wave festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Over the years, the Bill T. Jones-Arnie Zane company has garnered much admiration for its creation of its own brand of postmodern dance which has become known for energetic dances set to narrative texts and postmodern music. Zane and Jones choreography often explored issues such as racism, religion, sexism, and the nuclear age. They created the trilogy Monkey Run Road, Blauvelt Mountain (both 1979), and Valley Cottage (1980) (for which Helen Thorington composed the sound scores). In 1984, Zane and Jones achieved box office success and created Secret Pastures. In Secret Pastures, Zane played a mad scientist who creates a fabricated man (Jones). Zane and Jones also collaborated on Ritual Ruckus (How to Walk an Elephant) for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in 1985. Awards Zane received his first award in the arts for photography when he received a Creative Artists Public Service (CAPS) Fellowship in 1973. He was also the recipient of a second CAPS Fellowship in 1981 for choreography, as well as two Choreographic Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts (1983 and 1984). In 1980, Zane was co-recipient, with Bill T. Jones, of the German Critics Award for his work, Blauvelt Mountain. Death Zane died on March 30, 1988 at the age of 39 of AIDS-related lymphoma at his home in Valley Cottage, N.Y.A Partner Exits, a Solo Begins, Jennifer Dunning, The New York Times, November 4, 1990. Following his death, Jones choreographed Absence, a piece that evoked the memory of his late lover and partner Arnie Zane. Absence addresses the varied feelings associated with mourning. After a 1989 performance of Absence, writer Robert Jones described the piece as \\"a shimmering, ecstatic quality that was euphoric and almost unbearably moving.\\" Tobi Tobias, dance critic for New York, said that the work took \\"its shape from Zane's special loves: still images and highly wrought, emotion-saturated vocal music.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Ingartists *New York Times *Mit Press Journals *Artists With AIDS American choreographers American male dancers Modern dancers 1948 births 1988 deaths People from the Bronx Binghamton University alumni Artists from New York City 20th-century American dancers AIDS-related deaths in New York (state) ","title":"Arnie Zane"},{"id":"18595050","text":"Peder Jensen Fauchald (15 November 1791 ‚Äì 1 July 1856) was a Norwegian politician.

It can also refer to the combining of African and other cultural elements found in Bolivian society such as religion, music, language, the arts, and class culture. The Afro-Bolivians are recognized as one of the constituent ethnic groups of Bolivia by the country's government, and are ceremonially led by a king who traces his descent back to a line of monarchs that reigned in Africa during the medieval period. They numbered 23,330 according to the 2012 census. History of slavery in Bolivia In 1544, the Spanish Conquistadors discovered the silver mines in a city now called Potos√≠, which is on the base of Cerro Rico (Rich Mountain) in Bolivia. Almost immediately, they began enslaving the natives as workers in the mines. However, the health of the natives working in the mines became very poor, which is why the Spanish began to look towards a new group for labor. By the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Spanish mine owners and barons began bringing in African slaves in high numbers to help work the mines with the natives who were still able.Afro-Bolivians Slaves were put to work in difficult conditions. Some slaves working in the mines survived no more than a few months. Initially, the slaves were not used to working at such a high altitude. Many of these Native and African workers' lives were cut short because of the toxic smelter fumes and mercury vapors they inhaled while working the mines. Slaves worked in the mines for 4 months on average. As such they had to be blindfolded upon leaving the mines to protect their eyes, which had become adapted to darkness. Although it was a requirement for Natives and Africans over 18 years of age to work in the mines for 12-hour shifts, younger children were still reputed to be put to work in the mines. These children worked fewer hours; however, they were still exposed to the same extremely harsh conditions of all the miners, including asbestos, toxic gases, cave-ins, and explosions. It is estimated that as many as eight million Africans and Natives died from working the mines between 1545, when the Spaniards first put the Natives to work, until 1825, the end of the colonial period. The Spaniards' way of fortifying the slaves against the harsh conditions in the mines was to provide them with coca leaves to chew. Coca, a very important element of Bolivian culture, is an agricultural product consumed in Bolivia that can also be processed into cocaine. By chewing coca leaves, the slaves numbed their senses to the cold, as well as dampening the feeling of hunger and alleviating altitude sickness. The Yungas After their emancipation in the 19th century, Afro-Bolivians would relocate to a place called the Yungas. The Yungas, which is not far north from the city of La Paz, is where most of the country's coca is grown. In parts of the Yungas such as Coroico, Mururata, Chicaloma, Calacala-Coscoma, and Irupana are a large number of Bolivians of African heritage. Before the Bolivians relocated to the Yungas, it was a place mostly inhabited by indigenous Aymara people and mestizos (European and Native mixed people). Keeping the culture Although these Afro-Bolivians were free, they still had a difficult battle in trying to maintain their culture. Many elements of their culture began to disappear, such as their feast, language, and spiritual sense to name a few. They had to fight very strongly against the colonial aggression and exclusion of their post-emancipation culture. One of the ways that they were able to hold on to this culture was through their music and dance. Saya music The biggest African influence in Bolivian culture is Saya music or La Saya. Saya, which is growing in popularity in Bolivia, is still very misunderstood. The reason for this lack of understanding of saya is because the interpretation of the instruments as well as the rhythm is very peculiar. It involves Andean instruments incorporated with African percussion. The primary instrument is the drum, which was passed on by their African ancestors, along with gourds, shakers, and even jingles bells that are attached to their clothing on the ankle area. During the performance of saya, the Afro-Bolivians wear Aymara style clothing. The women wear a bright multi- colored blouse with ribbons, a multi-colored skirt called a ‚Äúpollera‚Äù, with a ‚Äúmanta‚Äù (back cover) in their hand, and a bowler hat. The men on the other hand, wear a hat, feast shirt, an Aymara style sash around the waist, woolen thick cloth pants called ‚Äúbayeta pants‚Äù, and sandals. Every rhythm of Saya begins with the beating of a jingle bell by the Caporal (foreman) who guides the dance. This Caporal (also called capataz) guides the dancers with a cudgel (whip) in hand, decorated pants, and jingle bells near the ankles. The women, who have their own guide during this dance, sing while moving their hips, shaking their hands, as well as dialoguing with the men who play the bass drum and coancha. Afro-Bolivians today King Julio Pinedo, and Queen of the Afro-Bolivian communityhttps://www.casarealafroboliviana.org/fundamentos- juridicos.html in 2012 Even though Bolivia had the richest silver mine in the world in the 17th century, it is currently the 2nd poorest country in South America. Most Bolivians live in rural areas, are unable to acquire basic needs, and depend on farming for their survival. In fact, it was reported at Bolivia's national referendum in 2004, that Afro-Bolivians (as well as the indigenous people) face discrimination, disadvantages in health, life expectancy, education, income, literacy, and work under brutal conditions. It has been estimated that 25,000 Afro-Bolivians live in the Yungas. They are proud of their culture and have fought very hard to preserve it. In fact, in the town of Mururata, the Afro-Bolivians managed to maintain their traditional culture, to the point of maintaining a continuous Afro-Bolivian monarchy currently led by Julio Pinedo. Afro-Bolivians spread to the east in Cochabamba and Santa Cruz de la Sierra. In Santa Cruz there are more Afro-Brazilians than Afro-Bolivians. They are trying to put together African culture classes for the young people, in an attempt to maintain their African culture. Despite the Afro-Bolivian community fervently working to preserve their culture, many Afro-Bolivians have reported experiencing severe racism and feelings of isolation from society due to intolerance. Laws that actually criminalize racism and discrimination in Afro-Bolivia have slowly been ratified as the first anti-discriminatory law (law 45) was passed in 2010 and was met with violent protesting and rioting. In 2009 President Evo Morales added amendments to the national constitution that outlined the rights of Afro-Bolivians and guaranteed the protection of such liberties. The amendments also generally extended to indigenous peoples and officially recognized Afro-Bolivians as a minority group in Bolivia despite them not being included in the national census three years later. In addition to the country's constitution being updated in 2009, President Morales created the Vice Ministry for Decolonization to create policies that criminalize racism while working to improve literacy and create better race relations in Bolivia.The Vice Ministry for Decolonization also works to dismantle colorism and racism influenced by European colonization while also promoting the philosophy of \\"intercultural- ity\\" in which citizens of the nation recognize every ethnic groups' traditions and cultural practices as contributions to society.

It is proprietary software, commercialized by Kx Systems. Q serves as the query language for kdb+, a disk based and in-memory, column-based database. Kdb+ is based on the language k, a terse variant of the language APL. Q is a thin wrapper around k, providing a more readable, English-like interface. Overview The fundamental building blocks of q are atoms, lists, and functions. Atoms are scalars and include the data types numeric, character, date, and time. Lists are ordered collections of atoms (or other lists) upon which the higher level data structures dictionaries and tables are internally constructed. A dictionary is a map of a list of keys to a list of values. A table is a transposed dictionary of symbol keys and equal length lists (columns) as values. A keyed table, analogous to a table with a primary key placed on it, is a dictionary where the keys and values are arranged as two tables. The following code demonstrates the relationships of the data structures. Expressions to evaluate appear prefixed with the \`q)\` prompt, with the output of the evaluation shown beneath: q)\`john / an atom of type symbol \`john q)50 / an atom of type integer 50 q)\`john\`jack / a list of symbols \`john\`jack q)50 60 / a list of integers 50 60 q)\`john\`jack!50 60 / a list of symbols and a list of integers combined to form a dictionary john 50 jack 60 q)\`name\`age!(\`john\`jack;50 60) / an arrangement termed a column dictionary name john jack age  50 60 q)flip \`name\`age!(\`john\`jack;50 60) / when transposed via the function \\"flip\\", the column dictionary becomes a table name age ---- john 50 jack 60 q)(flip (enlist \`name)!enlist \`john\`jack)!flip (enlist \`age)!enlist 50 60 / two equal length tables combined as a dictionary become a keyed table name age  --- john 50 jack 60 These entities are manipulated via functions, which include the built-in functions that come with Q (which are defined as K macros) and user-defined functions. Functions are a data type, and can be placed in lists, dictionaries and tables, or passed to other functions as parameters. Examples Like K, Q is interpreted and the result of the evaluation of an expression is immediately displayed, unless terminated with a semi-colon. The Hello world program is thus trivial: q)\\"Hello world!\\" \\"Hello world!\\" The following expression sorts a list of strings stored in the variable x descending by their lengths: x@idesc count each x The expression is evaluated from right to left as follows: # \\"count each x\\" returns the length of each word in the list x. # \\"idesc\\" returns the indices that would sort a list of values in descending order. # @ use the integer values on the right to index into the original list of strings. The factorial function can be implemented directly in Q as {prd 1+til x} or recursively as {$[x=0;1;x*.z.s[x-1 } Note that in both cases the function implicitly takes a single argument called x - in general it is possible to use up to three implicit arguments, named x, y and z, or to give arguments local variable bindings explicitly. In the direct implementation, the expression \\"til x\\" enumerates the integers from 0 to x-1, \\"1+\\" adds 1 to every element of the list and \\"prd\\" returns the product of the list. In the recursive implementation, the syntax \\"$[condition; expr1; expr2]\\" is a ternary conditional - if the condition is true then expr1 is returned; otherwise expr2 is returned. The expression \\".z.s\\" is loosely equivalent to 'this' in Java or 'self' in Python - it is a reference to the containing object, and enables functions in q to call themselves. When x is an integer greater than 2, the following function will return 1 if it is a prime, otherwise 0: {min x mod 2_til x} The function is evaluated from right to left: # \\"til x\\" enumerate the non-negative integers less than x. # \\"2_\\" drops the first two elements of the enumeration (0 and 1). # \\"x mod\\" performs modulo division between the original integer and each value in the truncated list. # \\"min\\" find the minimum value of the list of modulo result. The q programming language contains its own table query syntax called qSQL, which resembles traditional SQL but has important differences, mainly due to the fact that the underlying tables are oriented by column, rather than by row. q)show t:([] name:\`john\`jack\`jill\`jane; age: 50 60 50 20) / define a simple table and assign to \\"t\\" name age ---- john 50 jack 60 jill 50 jane 20 q)select from t where name like \\"ja*\\",age>50 name age ---- jack 60 q)select rows:count i by age from t age rows  ---- 20  1 50  2 60  1 ReferencesFurther reading External links * , Kx Systems * , kdb+ * Online documentation and developer site * Online kdb Tutorials * qStudio an IDE with timeseries charting for kdb * Kx Developer, an IDE for kdb+ * kdb+ repositories on GitHub * Free online version of Q for Mortals * Q for All video tutorials * Technical Whitepapers * jq, an implementation of q on the JVM APL programming language family Array programming languages Data-centric programming languages Dynamic programming languages Function-level languages Proprietary database management systems ","title":"Q (programming language from Kx Systems)"},{"id":"18595075","text":"Ajuga chamaepitys is a species of flowering plant of the family Lamiaceae.

Background Munro was a Lisburn linen merchant and Presbyterian United Irishman who had no military experience but had taken over command of the Down organisation following the arrest of the designated leader, Rev. William Steel Dickson on 5 June. Upon hearing of the victory at Saintfield on 9 June, Munro joined the rebel camp there and then moved to Ednavady Hill, Ballynahinch to join the thousands who had gathered in support of the rebellion. The response of the British garrisons was to converge on Ballynahinch from Belfast and Downpatrick in two columns accompanied by several pieces of cannon. Battle of Ballynahinch The battle began on the night of 12 June when two hills to the left and right of Ballynahinch were occupied by the British who pounded the town with their cannon. During a pause when night fell, some rebel officers were said to have pressed Munro for a night attack but he refused on the grounds that it was unchivalrous. As a consequence many disillusioned rebels slipped away during the night. As dawn broke the battle recommenced with the rebels attacked from two sides and although achieving some initial success, confusion in the rebel army saw the United Irishmen retreat in chaos, pursued by regrouping British forces who quickly took advantage by turning retreat into massacre. Initial reports claimed four hundred rebels were killed, while British losses were around forty.Nugent, report to Dublin Castle 14 June 1798 James Thomson (mathematician), the father of the famous scientist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin was at the battle and published an eyewitness account. Aftermath Munro escaped the field of battle but was betrayed by a farmer who he had paid to conceal him and was hanged in front of his own house in Lisburn on 16 June. Ballynahinch was sacked by the victorious military after the battle with sixty-three houses being burned down. Cavalry scoured the surrounding countryside for rebels, raiding homes and killing indiscriminately, the 22nd Dragoons being guilty of some of the worst atrocities.p.224, The Summer Soldiers -The 1798 rebellion in Antrim and Down A.T.Q Stewart (Belfast 1995) The most famous victim was Betsy Gray, a young female rebel who, with her two brothers, was slaughtered in the post-battle massacre, ensuring her place in legend to this day. Following the suppression of the 1798 Rebellion and the passing of the Act of Union, the Presbyterian population in the area of Ballynahinch would subsequently become predominantly Unionist and the Orange Order would have a strong presence there. Nonetheless, historian Guy Beiner has shown that many local family traditions continued to preserve in private memories of their United Irish ancestors' participation in the battle.Guy Beiner, Forgetful Remembrance: Social Forgetting and Vernacular Historiography of a Rebellion in Ulster (Oxford University Press, 2018).

It is the simplest of the alkylsulfonic acids. Salts and esters of methanesulfonic acid are known as mesylates (or methanesulfonates, as in ethyl methanesulfonate). It is hygroscopic in its concentrated form. Methanesulfonic acid may be considered an intermediate compound between sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and methylsulfonylmethane ((CH3)2SO2), effectively replacing an ‚ÄìOH group with a ‚ÄìCH3 group at each step. This pattern can extend no further in either direction without breaking down the ‚ÄìSO2‚Äì group. Methanesulfonic acid can dissolve a wide range of metal salts, many of them in significantly higher concentrations than in hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. Applications Methanesulfonic acid is used as an acid catalyst in organic reactions because it is a non-volatile, strong acid that is soluble in organic solvents. It is convenient for industrial applications because it is liquid at ambient temperature, while the closely related p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) is solid. However, in a laboratory setting, solid PTSA is more convenient. Methanesulfonic acid can be used in the generation of borane (BH3) by reacting methanesulfonic acid with NaBH4 in an aprotic solvent such as THF or DMS, the complex of BH3 and the solvent is formed. =Electroplating= Solutions of methanesulfonic acid are used for the electroplating of tin and tin-lead solders. It is displacing the use of fluoroboric acid, which releases corrosive and volatile hydrogen fluoride. Methanesulfonic acid is also a primary ingredient in rust and scale removers.

A 1-hectare property was bought, and 4,000 square meters of it were allotted for the school. The Pre-school Department opened in June 1995 with 12 enrollees at the old site. Former parish priest Anselmo P. Pamintuan set up the Elementary Department in June 1996, with 250 students. Because of its notable increase in mid-1996, upon the instructions of the archbishop of ManilaJaime L. Cardinal Sin, the school was housed in the basement of the new church. As the CSBN grew, in the summer of 1997 a single- floor building with 5 classrooms was built to house the High School Department. By school year 1999-2000 the first students graduated at secondary level. In May 2003 Father Albert N. Delvo was appointed by the bishop emeritus of Novaliches, Teodoro C. Bacani, Jr. as superintendent, to succeed Rev. Msgr. Pamintuan as the school director. In July 2004 he was succeeded by Fr. Victor Emmanuel I. Clemen, who led the school for 3 years.

Due to increased population growth in both areas, the majority of the road is four lanes wide, with certain areas retaining the original two lane configuration. Route description Beginning at a bridge over the Savannah River, the route runs through a densely wooded area and crosses nearly two miles of marshes within the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge. At the site of a former truck weigh station, the route merges with US 17 and SC 170 is co-signed with US 17 for approximately two miles on a four lane, divided highway configuration. In Limehouse the highway branches off from US 17 to the east after running under a railroad bridge, and flanks the east side of that route momentarily until a fork on the road with Limehouse Road (which includes Levy Road slicing through both) where it curves onto Freedom Parkway. Freedom Parkway makes a slight curve to the right before terminating at SC 315 (formerly SC 170 Alternate), and SC 170 makes a left turn at Oaktie Highway. SC 170 rejoins its previous trajectory after the western terminus of the overlap with SC 46\\\\. SC 170 and SC 46 are co-signed for SC 46/170 Overlap (Google Maps) crossing the Beaufort County Line in the process where it becomes May River Road until reaching a traffic circle in Pritchardville. SC 46 continues to the east while SC 170 turns north onto four-lane Oaktie Highway. After the Bluffton Parkway, which provides direct access to Bluffton, it skirts the eastern edge of the Sun City Hilton Head development, then passes under a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 278, which is known locally as McGarvey's Corner. For the next approximately eight miles, the road runs along the Jasper-Beaufort County Line. The divided highway briefly ends at the intersection of a private road named \\"Heffallump Road\\" but remains four-lanes with a center-left turn lane provision only to become a divided highway again at the Oldfield Golf Club and Equestrian Center. Curving back to the east as it approaches the intersection with South Carolina Highway 462, the road later re-enters Jasper County at the two ends of Old Baileys Road, then runs along the Jasper-Beaufort County border again until it reaches the intersection of Snake Road and Callawassie Island's entrance road. Now fully in Beaufort County once again the road becomes more scenic, with panoramas of marshes and surrounding islands extending for miles. The divided highway ends again, as it approaches the Edgar C. Glenn Boat Ramp under the four-lane (with center-painted divider) bridge over the Chechesee River and enters Lemon Island. The road briefly becomes a four-lane divided highway again as it winds southeast through the island but the divider itself is short-lived. SC 170 leaves the island and enters Burton by crossing the Broad River over the , four-lane Edward Burton Rogers Bridge. The bridge was built in 2004 and replaced a two-lane drawbridge. Before returning to the mainland, the remains of the former drawbridge can be found on the north side of the existing bridge, and serves as a fishing pier, then a frontage road to the Broad River Boat Launching area.Beaufort County Boat Ramps (Saltchef.com) SC 170 is now known as Robert Smalls Parkway for approximately five miles as it travels in a northeasterly direction across Port Royal Island. The frontage road ends across from the intersection with SC 128, and later SC 170 intersects with US 21 and briefly becomes a divided highway at the crossing with the Spanish Moss Trail before turning straight north and finally ending at US 21 Business in Beaufort. History Established around 1931 as a new primary routing from US 17 (today Levy Road S-27-34) to SC 33 (today SC 46). In 1939, it was extended north to where US 278 exists today. In 1940, it was extended north again to SC 368, near Coosawhatchie; and again by 1942 to US 17 in Coosawhatchie. In 1949, SC 170 was extended west from Coosawhatchie to SC 128, near Gillisonville, a renumbering of SC 366. In 1958, SC 170 was rerouted to US 21 in Beaufort, via the Broad River Bridge, replacing part of SC 169; its old alignment north through Coosawhatchie was renumbered to SC 462. Around 1975, SC 170 was extended slightly south over an old alignment of US 17 as mainline US 17 was placed on a new bypass west of Limehouse. In 1995, SC 170 was extended south into Georgia, replacing of mainline US 17\\\\. Major intersectionsSpecial routes=Levy alternate route= Established around 1972 as a new primary routing from US 17 Alt to SC 170; an upgrade to secondary road S-27-117 (built in the late 1950s) and part of S-27-92 (Belinger Hill Road). Its existence created a rare alternate spur, but provided a more direct routing between Bluffton and Savannah. In 2010, it was renumbered as SC 315\\\\.

As a member of the Comet Line, she helped downed Allied airmen evade capture by German forces. After being betrayed in November 1942, she was sentenced to death and subjected to the 'Nacht und Nebel' policy designed to make such opponents of the Nazis 'disappear' in prison camps. She survived to tell her story to her family back in England and to receive awards for her work. Her teen age children, Elsie and Robert, also survived prison, but her husband Georges was executed. Early life Elsie Mary Bell was born on 21 June 1894 in Acton, Middlesex, the daughter of Robert Edward Bell and Alice Mary (n√©e Gowen). After attending school in Great Yarmouth, Elsie trained at Norwich Teacher Training College and, on leaving in 1915, was accepted as a teacher by the London County Council. While working in London during the First World War she met a young Belgian soldier, Georges Mar√©chal, who had been sent to a hospital in London to recover after contracting pneumonia while serving in the water-logged trenches of South West Belgium. They were married on 21 June 1920 and started married life in Koblenz, Germany where Georges was working. They had three children: Lilian Grace, who died as a toddler, Elsie, born about 1924, and Robert, born about 1926. In 1929 Georges returned with his family to Brussels. \\"Keswick Hall College,\\" , accessed 9 Oct 2019 World War II Germany invaded Belgium in May 1940 and soon occupied the country. Georges Mar√©chal initially resisted the German occupation as a member of an intelligence network collecting information about the German occupation and passing it along to the British. The Mar√©chal family lived near the family of Andr√©e de Jongh in Brussels and they began to collaborate with de Jongh (code named \\"D√©d√©e), the founder of what would become known as the Comet Line. The Comet Line was formed in 1941 to help Allied airmen who had been shot down over enemy territory evade capture and reach safety by smuggling them through France to neutral Spain. The two Elsies, mother and 18-year-old daughter, were bilingual in French and English and could communicate with downed airmen, few of whom could speak French. They sheltered in their home both downed airmen and fugitives from the Germans. Neave, Airey, Little Cyclone,, London: Biteback Publishing, p. 62 One technique that the Germans used to infiltrate and capture Comet Line helpers was by having English-speaking Germans pose as downed pilots and betray those Belgians who were helping them. Few Comet Line helpers were fluent in English, so the two Elsies were invaluable in evaluating the bonafides of a man who claimed to be a downed allied airman. Working for the leader of the Comet Line in Brussels, Jean Greindl (code name \\"Nemo\\"), the older Elsie traveled around Brussels and vicinity to solicit help for the Comet Line from priests, academics and others, and the Mar√©chals sheltered downed airmen in their home. \\"The Last Passage: Guia Didactica\\" [http://thelastpassagedocumental.blogspot.com/p/guia-didactica.html, accessed 9 Oct 2019 Capture On November 19, 1942, two men claiming to be American airmen appeared at the door of the Mar√©chal home, brought there by a Comet Line helper. This was contrary to the usual practice of the Comet Line and the young Elsie was immediately suspicious as the two didn't appear \\"American\\" to her. Their behavior was odd. However, the two Elsies had had little contact with Americans and were unsure. After eating and being interviewed, the two airmen said they wanted to take a walk and get some air and departed. Young Elsie left the house to find \\"Nemo\\" for instructions. When the two \\"airmen\\" returned to the Mar√©chal house an hour later they came with pistols and arrested the older Elsie, and subsequently arrested the younger Elsie, Robert, and Georges Mar√©chal, taking them to Gestapo headquarters. A young man, Victor Michiels, sent to the Mar√©chal home by Nemo to check on them was shot to death by the Gestapo.

Early life Tony Taccone was born on July 4, 1951 in Queens, New York, to an Italian-American father and a Puerto Rican mother.Hurwitt, Robert (July 5, 2006), \\"Tony Taccone: Riding high on his recent successes, theater veteran has big plans for Berkeley Rep\\". Chronicle Theater Critic. (accessed 2009-05-18) They encouraged their children to go into the arts; their daughter became a photographer, and both sons found careers in theater. Taccone, attended Boston College as an English major. He frequently participated in poetry readings, which led to performance art. After marrying, he accompanied his wife to the University of Colorado and became involved in the drama department. His acting troupe asked him to fill in for their sick director and stage the next play. Taccone called the gig the \\"closest thing I ever had to an epiphany,\\" and permanently went behind the curtain. After graduating, Taccone enrolled in UC Berkeley in the doctoral directing program, where he became close friends with fellow student Richard E.T. White. Career When White became artistic director of the Eureka Theatre, a converted warehouse in San Francisco's Mission District,McLaughlin, Ellen (September 2006), \\"In Cahoots with Tony Taccone\\". American Theatre. 23 (7):26-58 he invited Taccone along. In 1981, White left and Taccone replaced him as the artistic director. It was there that Taccone began his partnership with Tony Kushner, who he commissioned to write what Kushner thought would be a short chamber piece called Angels in America. Over Taccone's tenure there, the Eureka's annual budget grew from $60,000 to $780,000 as their subscriber number grew to 2,400 and the repertory moved to a new building because their theater was destroyed by an arsonist.Goodwin, Joy (March 2, 2008), \\"Left Coast Ideas, Floating East\\". New York Times. Despite the growth, they required $1.3 million in order to stay afloat, and talks began that the repertory could not sustain its artists with growing families. Taccone was extremely reluctant to leave, but announced his resignation in 1988. That year, Taccone became the associate artistic director of Berkeley Rep under Sharon Ott, again replacing White. Right around that time, Angels in America, which ended up becoming a two-part, seven-hour epic, was becoming a national sensation critically and otherwise, and a boon to the Eureka. Four years later (in 1992), he and Oskar Eustis co-directed the world premiere of the complete work at the Mark Taper Forum. In 1997, Berkeley Rep won a Tony for Best Regional Theater. That year, Ott left to become artistic director of Seattle Repertory, and Taccone became full artistic director,(May/June 2009), \\"KUSHNER'S BAC, AND THE GUTHRIE'S GOT HIM\\".

Established in 1971, Close Up offers programming to educate and encourage young people to participate in their civic affairs and government. About 850,000 students and teachers have participated in its programs. History After taking a group of American students abroad to study foreign government, Close Up founder and former State Department official Stephen A. Janger (1936-2015) noticed growing cynicism and critique of the American government among young people. As the events of the 1960s unfolded, Janger desired to help students gain a better understanding of their own government. With his wife Kathie and his brother Stanford, Janger founded the Close Up Foundation in 1971. During its first year, Close Up facilitated its first Washington High School Program with over 500 student participants from Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2007/04/11/AR2007041100170.htmlhttp://www.c-span.org/video/?187328-1/35th- anniversary-tribute-dinner  Programs  Close Up programs cater to various high and middle school audiences. Close Up also offers a program for New Americans, specialized programs for Native Americans, Teaching American History (TAH) programs for teachers, and several theme-based programs that enable participants to benefit from Washington's seasonality. Educators use Close Up programming to enhance classroom learning. Close Up curriculum complements Common Core (C3) Framework. = High School Program = The Washington High School Program aims to build students‚Äô sense of political efficacy. During this six-day/five-night program students meet with elected officials on Capitol Hill, participate in structured learning activities at Washington‚Äôs monuments and memorials, and engage in workshops about how our government works. = Middle School Program = The Washington Middle School Program provides students hands-on opportunities to interact with government and history. During this four day, three-night program students explore the links between history and the problems and prospects today. Emphasis will be placed on how the actions of ordinary citizens can directly affect public policymaking. = Teacher Program = Teachers and administrators can participate in an adult-learning program that runs parallel to student programming. The Teacher Program includes the study of some of Washington‚Äôs lesser-known monuments and memorials that provide a forum for educators to share best practices with peers. Upon completion, educators can earn Graduate Credits or Continuing Education Units. Outreach Close Up programs have hosted students and teachers from all 50 states and Abu Dubai, American Samoa, Canada, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Cura√ßao, Guam, Federated States of Micronesia, Puerto Rico, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Mexico, Republic of Palau and the United States Virgin Islands. Many schools send groups to Close Up every year. Additionally, many students decide to attend on their own or with friends. Programs are offered year-round, including summer. Close Up also serves teachers and students nationwide though its mix of Washington-based and local, as well as classroom-based learning tools such as publications, lesson plans, TV series, and videos. Its flagship publication is Current Issues. Current Issues is an annual supplemental textbook that provides insightful coverage of public policy topics. Its \\"pro-con\\" format intends to stimulate debate among students and for helping students appreciate multiple points of view.  Program Components  * Capitol Hill Day ‚Äì Some groups may meet with offices of their Congressional delegation. Students also get the opportunity to visit other sites on Capitol Hill, such as the Supreme Court, Library of Congress, and Capitol Visitors Center. * Mock Congress ‚Äì Prior to ‚ÄúHill Day,‚Äù groups participate in a large group activity that uses mock legislative bills on current policy controversies and issues to help students better understand how the legislative process works through simulation. * Current Issues Debate ‚Äì Students will deliberate upon available policy options and consider how the government should weigh and act on competing priorities. * Domestic Issues Debate ‚Äì Students explore a variety of current controversial domestic issues during this large question-and-answer session with two professionals from both a liberal and conservative background.

A young Horatio Nelson served aboard her as a midshipman on an expedition to the Arctic in 1773. Design and construction Plan showing the inboard profile, sections, upper deck and hold for Carcass (1759), an 8-gun, sloop- rigged bomb vessel. The Infernal class were designed by Thomas Slade. Carcass was ordered from Stanton & Wells, Rotherhithe on 21 September 1758 and launched on 27 January 1759, having been named over a week previously on 19 January. Carcass was commissioned as a sloop at Deptford Dockyard on 27 June 1759, having cost ¬£3,757.14.6d to build, and a further ¬£2,144.8.1d spent on fitting out. Career Carcass‚Äôs first commander was Charles Inglis, who took her to join Admiral George Rodney's squadron in the English Channel. The vessel was present at the bombardment of Le Havre on 3 July 1759, and the following year captured the 10-gun Mercury off La Rochelle. She was refitted in March 1760 for ¬£531.15.1d, and again in 1761. The sloop was recommissioned in January 1762 under the command of Lord William Campbell, before being refitted again, this time as a bomb vessel between February and March 1762. She came under the command of Robert Fanshawe in August 1762, before being paid off in 1763. A series of repairs and refits were carried out over the next two years, before Carcass was recommissioned in August 1765 under Captain Mark Pattison. Pattison sailed her to Jamaica in October 1765, and by September 1766 she was under Thomas Jordan. Further repairs at Deptford followed, before she was recommissioned in June 1771 under Commander Skeffington Lutwidge, serving in the Irish Sea. Carcass was paid off in April 1773, before undergoing a refit at Sheerness in preparation for an expedition to the Arctic. The refit cost ¬£2,895.8.8d, and on its completion, she joined Constantine Phipps's expedition. Horatio Nelson was assigned to Carcass as a midshipman, through the influence of his uncle, Maurice Suckling. They managed to reach within ten degrees of the North Pole, but were forced back by the ice, and returned to Britain in September 1773. By 1800 Lutwidge began to circulate a story that while the ship had been trapped in the ice, Nelson had seen and pursued a polar bear, before being ordered to return to the ship. Lutwidge's later version, in 1809, reported that Nelson and a companion had given chase to the bear, but on being questioned why, replied that \\"I wished, Sir, to get the skin for my father.\\"Sugden 2004, p. 75. After the conclusion of the Arctic expedition, Carcass was again paid off, recommissioning again in January 1775 under Commander James Reid for service on the African coast. She was again paid off, in September that year, followed by another series of refits. Carcass sailed to North America in May 1776 under Commander Robert Dring, who was succeeded by John Howorth in February 1777. After a period under the command of Thomas Barker, the vessel came under the command of Edward Edwards, who took her to the West Indies with William Hotham in 1780. She was under John Young, off the Leeward Islands by the end of 1780, and was paid off in December 1781. The vessel was finally sold at Woolwich for ¬£320 on 5 August 1784.

At the Dissolution of the Monasteries the church and chapter house range were pulled down but the domestic buildings were left intact. Parts of the south and west ranges of the monastery survive with the south range now being a museum owned by Exeter City Council.  History  In 1068, William the Conqueror laid siege to Exeter, where the mother of Harold Godwinson, whom he had just defeated in the Battle of Hastings, was living. After her hasty departure William gave the church of St Olave at Exeter to Battle Abbey. Monks, who were sent from Battle to administer the church and its possessions, set about building a monastery with its own church, which was dedicated to Saint Nicholas in 1087. In the 12th and 13th centuries the Priory gathered gifts of land and property and new monastic buildings were erected as funds permitted. Hospitality was built into the monastic rule and a guest house or wing was essential within a monastery. The monks provided hospitality for pilgrims and other travellers and accommodation for important guests. The Priory had a very important and lively life within the city until the dissolution of the smaller monasteries by King Henry VIII in 1536, when the monks were pensioned off and their church and cloisters were pulled down. The remaining buildings and precinct were then sold by the Crown. Between 1575 and 1602, the building was turned into an impressive Elizabethan town house. After that the building became subdivided into houses and businesses. Between 1820 and 1913, the Priory was divided into five lots of premises and all were given entrance doors and new windows. Exeter Corporation bought the Priory in 1913 in order to restore it to show its original monastic architecture. It was opened to the public as a small museum three years later. Repairs and reinterpretation were undertaken in 2007 with funding from the HLF and Renaissance. During the 2007 development, the Priory was partially restored to how it looked when it was a wealthy Tudor merchants house with methods used at the same period 500 years ago. Then, at the beginning of 2009, the priory had further maintenance, which was carried out by Devon-based Sub- Lime Renovations. It is designated as a Grade I listed building by Historic England.  Museum  As of 1916, the priory has been used as a museum. It is currently furnished as an Elizabethan town house, home of the wealthy Hurst family, in 1602. It has replica furniture and it is painted in the bright colours used in the Elizabethan period. It gives an insight into Tudor life from Exeter's collection of artefacts. It has been enhanced with modern amenities such as toilets and a gift shop. After being closed as a result of structural problems from 2015. until 2018, it has now repopened under the Exeter Historic Buildings Trust, who also own the north range of the building. It will be open every Sunday 1pm until 4pm and on special event days throughout the year.

In archaeology In archaeology anthropic units are strata or deposits of material containing a high proportion of man-made detritus. For example:Massimo Vidale (1990). Study of the Moneer South East Area A Complex Industrial Site of Moenjodaro. East and West. Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente (IsIAO). 40(1/4): 301-314.

Confrontation of cosmological theories with observational data; Proceedings of the Symposium, Krakow, Poland, September 10‚Äì12, 1973. Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing. pp. 291-298. units of measurement that are on a human scale are occasionally referred to as \\"anthropic units\\", as for example here:Brian William Petley (1985). The fundamental physical constants and the frontier of measurement. Bristol; Boston: A. Hilger. p. 120. In social studies In fields of study such as sociology and ethnography, anthropic units are identifiable groupings of people. For example:J. J. Thomson (1896).

The Street of Armenian Patriarchate Interior of St. James Church The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem also known as the Armenian Patriarchate of Saint James ( , literally \\"Apostolic See of Saint James in Jerusalem\\") is located in the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem. The Armenian Apostolic Church is officially recognised under Israel's confessional system, for the self- regulation of status issues, such as marriage and divorce. Archbishop Nourhan Manougian, served the Armenian Church as the Grand Sacristan and the Patriarchal Vicar of the Patriarchate, when he was elected as the 97th Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem on January 24, 2013. Manougian succeeded Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, who died on October 12, 2012 after serving 22 years in the office. The Patriarch, along with a Synod of seven clergymen elected by the St. James Brotherhood, oversees the Patriarchate's operations. During World War I, survivors of the Armenian Genocide received shelter in the Armenian Convent in Jerusalem. The Armenian population of Jerusalem reached at that time 25,000 people. But political and economic instability in the region have reduced the Armenian population. Most Armenians in Jerusalem live in and around the Patriarchate at the St. James Monastery, which occupies most of the Armenian Quarter of the Old City. Apart from Jerusalem, there are Armenian Communities in Jaffa, Haifa and Nazareth, and in the Palestinian Territories. The Jerusalem Armenian community uses the Old Julian calendar, unlike the rest of the Armenian Church which use the Gregorian calendar. History In 638, after Saint Sophronius died and the Greeks did not appoint another bishop for Jerusalem, the Armenian Apostolic Church began appointing its own bishops for Jerusalem. The office has continued, with some interruptions, down to this day. The Bishops were later elevated in stature and became Patriarchs. The Armenian Patriarch is independent and self-governing. The Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem recognizes the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin as having pre- eminent supremacy in all spiritual matters. After the end of the Crusader period, the Armenian Patriarchs sought to establish good relations with the Muslim rulers. The Armenian Patriarch Sarkis I (1281‚Äì1313) met the Mamluk governor in Egypt and subsequently returned to his community in Jerusalem, hoping to usher in a period of peace for his people after the Crusades. In the 1340s the Armenians were permitted to build a wall around their quarter. The Mamluk government also engraved a protective declaration in Arabic on the western entrance to the quarter. The Armenian quarter in this period kept creating \\"facts on the ground\\" by the constant small expansions and consolidations. In the 1380s Patriarch Krikor IV built a priests' dining room across from the St. James Cathedral. Around 1415 the olive grove on the Mount of Olives, the Garden of Gethsemane, was purchased. In 1439, Armenians were removed by the Greeks and from the Golgotha chapel in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, but the Patriarch Mardiros I (1412‚Äì1450) purchased the ‚Äúopposite area‚Äù as compensation, and named it second Golgotha. This remains in the Patriarch's possession to this day. Because of the rights of the Armenian Church on the Golgotha Chapel, in the afternoon processions in the Holy Sepulcher, the Armenian Church has liturgy there. At times, the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem became politicized by struggles within the Armenian Church. The Armenian Patriarchate, due to its proximity to the Holy places and isolation from the main Armenian population, played an important role in the schism that began to affect the Armenian leaderships in Constantinople and Etchmiadzin (seat of the Armenian church). Significantly Bishop Eghiazar assumed the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem and in 1644 declared himself for a short period of time as \\"Catholicos\\" (\\"Leader\\") of all the Armenian church. In the 17th century, the Armenians were allowed after much pleading to enlarge the St. James Monastery. At the same time the Armenian Patriarch Hovhannes VII purchased a large parcel of land south of the St. James Cathedral, called ‚ÄúCham Tagh‚Äù. By 1752 the Patriarchate was busy renovating the entire quarter, and in 1828 further renovations took place after an earthquake. In 1850 the seminary complex at the south end of the St. James convent was completed. In 1833, the Armenians established the city's first printing press, and opened a theological seminary in 1843. In 1866, the Armenians had inaugurated the first photographic studio and their first newspaper in Jerusalem. In 1908, the Armenian community built two large buildings on the north-western side of the Old City, along Jaffa Street. As the Armenian diaspora spread throughout Europe and America, wealthy Armenians donated generously for the prosperity and continuity of the Patriarchate. The oil magnate and philanthropist Calouste Gulbenkian came to endow the Gulbenkian Library in the Armenian quarter that was named in gratitude in his name, today holding one of the great collection of ancient Armenian manuscripts including endless copies of the various Firmens, Ottoman edicts that granted the quarter protection and rights under Muslim rule. By the 1920s, most of the Armenian quarter had ‚ÄúEuropean style gable roofs‚Äù as opposed to the domes preferred in the Muslim quarter. In 1922 Armenians made up 8% of Jerusalem's Christians, bringing their total number to about 2,480 people. It is also noted that non-Armenians found comfort in the protection of the walled Armenian \\"compound\\". In the 1930s and 1940s, the Armenian quarter saw further renovations. The end of World War II brought also the division of Mandate Palestine and the establishment in 1948 of Israel. The numbers of Armenians residing at the time in the Holy Land totaled about 8,000. The Armenians who lived in Haifa and Jaffa, which became part of Israel, got the Israeli citizenship; whereas the huge majority of Palestinian Armenians lived in the Armenian Quarter, and the Armenian Patriarchate and its properties came under Jordanian rule. The Armenian community was further reduced after the 1967 Six-Day War and occupation, with many emigrating to Jordan and some to Europe and the United States, leaving around 2,000-3,000 in Jerusalem and the West Bank. The Patriarchate Complex The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem is the home of the Brotherhood of St. James, a monastic order of the Armenian Apostolic Church with about 60 members worldwide. Within the compound of the Patriarchate, also lie the private residences of Armenian families. This residential enclave was, at one time, the largest single compound that housed Armenians, and represented the demographic and spiritual core of Armenian presence in the Holy Land. The compound of the Patriarchate, which enforces a strict curfew of 10 p.m. when the massive doors are closed and locked until the early morning, also houses the administrative offices and residences of the Patriarch and the clergy. It also comprises: *The Cathedral of St. James *The Church of the Archangels, another important Armenian church in Jerusalem *The Church of St. Toros, which is home to the precious illuminated Armenian manuscript collection, the second largest in the world (over 4,000). Other branches of the Patriarchate located within the compound include: *The Theological Seminary of the Patriarchate, a complex located a hundred yards from the entrance of the compound, a gift of the late Armenian-American philanthropists Alex Manoogian and his wife Marie Manoogian. Armenian youths from all over the world, including the United States and Armenia, come to study for the priesthood here, and after ordination, help infuse new blood into the ranks of Armenian clergy worldwide. *The \\"Calouste Gulbenkian Library\\" of over 100,000 volumes, half in Armenian and the rest in English and other European languages.S.

Other facilities=Printing press and media= The Patriarchate also runs a printing press, the first to be established in Jerusalem, which has now become capable of undertaking commercial color printing. This was the first facility within the Armenian compound to adopt the concept of computerization on a dedicated scale. The official organ of the Patriarchate is the long-running periodical Sion (in Armenian ’ç’´’∏’∂) named after the Armenian name of Mount Zion. The students in the seminary also publish their own official organ Hay Yerusaghem (in Armenian ’Ä’°’µ ‘µ÷Ä’∏÷Ç’Ω’°’≤’ß’¥ meaning the Armenian Jerusalem) =Medical services / Clinic= Medical services against a symbolic fee are provided at a clinic donated by the Jinishian Medical Fund. Free meals to the aged and invalid pensioners and indigent members of the community are also provided. Jurisdiction The Patriarchate enjoys a semi-diplomatic status and is one of the three major guardians of the Christian Holy Places in the Holy Land (the other two are the Orthodox and Latin Patriarchates). Among these sites under joint control of the Armenian Patriarchate and other churches, chapels and holy places are: *The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City (Jerusalem) *The Chapel of the Ascension on the Mount of Olives *Tomb of the Virgin Mary in the Valley of Gethsemane *The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The Armenian Patriarchate also has jurisdiction over the Armenian Apostolic (Orthodox) communities in Palestine, Israel and Jordan.

Rothwell on October 4, 1880 Denver, Colorado and died on April 10, 1927) is a boxer who held the World Featherweight championship. He took the name \\"Young Corbett II\\" in honor of James J. Corbett, a heavyweight champion. Corbett was posthumously inducted into the Ring Magazine Hall of Fame in 1965 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2010. Pro career=World featherweight champion= Corbett became a professional boxer in 1896 and was undefeated in his first 13 fights with a record of 9-0-3-1. In 1901, Corbett defeated George Dixon for the Western featherweight title in Denver, Colorado. In his next fight, Corbett faced world featherweight champion Terry McGovern in Hartford, Connecticut. Corbett knocked out McGovern in the second round and took the title. He defended the title four times, including a rematch against McGovern, which Corbett also won by knockout. During this time he also engaged in a number of non-title matches, including one against Young Erne and two against Jimmy Briggs, both of which Corbett won. Attempts to match British World Featherweight Champion Ben Jordan with Young Corbett were not successful. During this time there is some dispute as to Corbett's claim on the featherweight title. Corbett had trouble making the featherweight limit of 126 pounds, and some sources claim he relinquished his title and moved to the lightweight division in December 1902. Abe Attell then claimed the featherweight title. Other sources show that Corbett defended his featherweight title at weights above 126 pounds with Attell defending the title at 126 pounds. =Later career= Regardless, Corbett continued to fight. He met future world champion Battling Nelson in two consecutive fights in 1904 and 1905, losing both by technical knockout. He then met old nemesis Young Erne in two more fights in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The first fight they fought to a draw. The second fight Corbett lost by decision. He had a mixed record over the five years remaining in his career. Aurelio Herrera knocked him out in 1906, Harlem Tommy Murphy defeated him via decision, but he defeated Young Erne by decision in 1907. His last fight was in 1910.

It was launched on May 12, 2008.http://www.t4tcolorado.org/story/nutritious-rice-worldResearch Projects Page on World Community Grid The objective of this project is to predict the structure of proteins of major strains of rice. The intent is to help farmers breed better rice strains with higher crop yields, promote greater disease and pest resistance, and utilize a full range of bioavailable nutrients that can benefit people around the world, especially in regions where malnutrition is a critical concern. Determining the structure of proteins is an extremely difficult and expensive process. Though it is possible to computationally predict a protein's structure from its corresponding DNA sequence, there are thousands of distinct proteins found in rice. This presents a computational challenge that a single computer cannot solve within a reasonable timeframe.Project Page on World Community Grid Website Once that the entire rice genome had been sequenced, the effort shifted to identifying genes that are involved in increased yield, disease resistance and nutritional value. This problem is made more difficult because very few cereal plants have been sequenced, and therefore, many of the rice genes do not resemble any genes of known function. The Computational Biology Research Group at the University of Washington developed the Protinfo software, which can produce protein structures at a fraction of the cost and time. Protinfo is being used to create three-dimensional models of the tens of thousands of rice proteins. These models are then used to predict the function of each protein and to understand the role of the gene that encodes it. The models, and any analysis resulting from examining them, will be housed at the Bioverse database and webserver, which is a comprehensive framework to relate molecules such as proteins and DNA to an organism's pathways and systems. Volunteers' computers on World Community Grid will run the Protinfo software to create models of all proteins encoded by the rice genome whose structure can be predicted reliably. These models will be analyzed to choose the best ones. From the resulting structures, prediction tools will determine the function of each protein and the role of the gene that encodes it. Using the power of Protinfo, World Community Grid will initially examine over 10,000 genes, and produce 100,000 models per gene. Eventually, the structures of 30,000 to 60,000 proteins will be studied. Generating one billion models on the 320 CPU cluster at the Computational Biology Research Group was anticipated to take about 30 years to accomplish; however, using World Community Grid took only about two years working at 167 TFLOPS. The distributed computing function was suspended in April 2010 while in-house analysis of results continues. The DC function will resume when funding is secured for further phases. The resulting knowledge base will hopefully lead to the development of improved hybrids of rice strains with higher yield, greater disease and pest resistance, and a full range of bioavailable nutrients. This knowledge can also be extended to other food crops such as wheat and maize.About The Project page on WCG  System Requirements  The project has minimum system requirementsNutritious Rice for the World FAQ that the computer that does calculations for the project must comply to, which include: * At least 128 MB RAM (with virtual memory enabled) * 200 MB Hard Disk Drive with at least 50 MB available for use * The ability to display 8-bit graphics at 640x480 resolution * An Internet connection with minimum 28kbit/s speed * Operating System: Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista, Linux, or Mac OS X using an Intel or PowerPC processor  See also  *Grid computing *World Community Grid *Monte Carlo method  References  Rice ","title":"Nutritious Rice for the World"},{"id":"18595984","text":"Mitzi Shore (n√©e Saidel; July 25, 1930 ‚Äì April 11, 2018) was an American comedy club owner. Her husband, Sammy Shore, co-founded The Comedy Store in Los Angeles in 1972 and Mitzi became owner two years later. Through the club, she had a huge influence on the careers of up-and-coming comedians for decades. Shore also founded Comedy Channel Inc. in 1982. Early life Shore was born Lillian Saidel on July 25, 1930 in Michigan to a Jewish family. Her parents were Fanny and Morris Saidel, a traveling salesman. She grew up near Green Bay, Wisconsin. She attended Green Bay East High School. Shore was educated at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison; she studied art but left to marry Sammy Shore after meeting him in 1950.  The Comedy Store  Sammy Shore co-founded the Comedy Store in 1972. When Sammy and Mitzi divorced in 1974, Mitzi acquired complete ownership as part of their divorce settlement. Sammy Shore was later quoted in 2003 by the Los Angeles Times as explaining that he \\"relinquished control of the club to lower his alimony payments\\". Shortly after she took full control, Shore obtained a significant cash loan from comedian Shecky Greene to help ensure continued operations. She was not only involved in day-to-day management but also in the recruitment and development of talent. Now-famous comedians including Robin Williams, Garry Shandling, Jay Leno, David Letterman, Chevy Chase, Sam Kinison, Marc Maron, Andrew Dice Clay, Jim Carrey, Joe Rogan, Bobcat Goldthwait, Bill Burr, Bobby Lee, Joey Diaz and John Witherspoon have worked at the Comedy Store for Shore. = 1979 strike and picket = Shore with Richard Belzer at the Comedy Store Shore refused to pay comics who performed in her club, insisting that the venue was a sort of \\"college of comedy\\" where comedians learned their craft rather than a money-making enterprise. However, in 1979, after the club had been expanded extensively, comedians began to insist that they be paid for their work. Shore refused and the performers picketed the establishment in what became a bitter six week strike action. Among those involved in leading the strike were Jay Leno, David Letterman (the club's emcee), and Tom Dreesen. After several months of picketing, and an incident in which Leno was injured by a car attempting to rush the picket line, Shore relented and agreed to pay comics $15 (an amount equal to $ today)https://westegg.com/inflation/ per set. The settlement set a precedent that resulted in New York City comedy clubs beginning to pay their talent as well, and other comedy clubs across the U.S. followed suit by paying comics to perform. = Belly Room = As early as 1978, Shore had converted the upstairs section of The Comedy Store into the Belly Room: a 50-seat audience for which she exclusively booked female comedians. At the time, professional comedy was very much a \\"boys' club\\", and bookings for female comedians were rare; opportunities for women to perform their own stand-up material with the most popular comics in the U.S. were unheard of. Shore's liberal risk-taking with booking talent continued for decades. In the 1990s, once female comics had become more established, Shore continued to cross boundaries with her audience by creating specialty nights for Latino, gay and lesbian performers. = Comedy Channel Inc. = Shore owned and operated Comedy Channel Inc. from 1982 until her death‚Äîa company established to create and sell video tapes of performances at The Comedy Store. In 1989, HBO launched its premium cable service The Comedy Channel. Shore's suit claimed HBO's service was an \\"indirect unauthorized use\\" of the name and trademark Comedy Channel. Mitzi Shore retained counsel James Blancarte and sued HBO for copyright infringement. The channel merged with Viacom's competing Ha! channel two years later, first under the name CTV: The Comedy Network, and then under its current name Comedy Central. Depictions in media The character Goldie on the Showtime TV show I'm Dying Up Here is based loosely on Shore. Joe Rogan dedicated his 2018 Netflix special 'Strange Times' to Shore. Personal life and death Her marriage with Sammy Shore lasted from 1950 until it ended in divorce in 1974. The couple had four children: Peter, Scott, actor Pauly, and daughter Sandi. Shore died of an unknown neurological disorder while under hospice care in Los Angeles on April 11, 2018, at the age of 87. She suffered from Parkinson's disease in her later years.

Location of Washington on the Brazos, Texas. The Star of the Republic Museum, in Washington, Texas, United States, is the only museum in the state of Texas created specifically to collect and interpret the culture and history of the Republic of Texas from 1836-1846.Beverly (1983), p. 86.Danilov (2002), p. 687. Within the Museum's two floors of exhibits, visitors can learn about the history of the time period through media experiences, as well as informative exhibits. The site of the Star of the Republic Museum was selected at Washington on the Brazos where elected delegates gathered on March 2, 1836 to declare Texas‚Äô independence from Mexico.Beverly (1983), p. 86.Danilov (2002), p. 687.Dixon (1924), pp. 27-28. Mission The Star of the Republic Museum was created by the Texas Legislature and is administered by Blinn College as a cultural and educational institution. Its purpose is to collect and preserve the material culture of the Texas Republic (1836‚Äì1846) and to interpret the history, cultures, diversity, and values of early Texans. The Museum strives to inspire interest, understanding and appreciation of Texas heritage for students, teachers, scholars, and the general public through exhibits, tours, programs, web activities, and outreach. History In 1969, the State of Texas created the Star of the Republic Museum through House Bill No. 634, of the Sixty-first Texas Legislature. The Museum officially opened on Texas Independence Day, March 2, 1970 and was transferred from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to Blinn College, located in Brenham, Texas. In 1972, the Star of the Republic Museum achieved accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums. As an accredited facility, the Museum is certified in adhering to the standards set forth by the museum profession, providing quality service to the public, and maintaining the collections in a responsible manner. Of the approximate 8,500 museums in the nation, only around 800 are accredited. In 1992 the Museum began a long-range plan for major facility renovations. The plans included renovations to the building, a building addition, and renovations to the Museum's exhibits. Through the efforts of this plan, The Republic of Texas exhibition was finished in 2002. This permanent exhibit allows visitors to view over 1,000 objects from the collection depicting the culture of early 19th century Texas. Exhibits Star of the Republic Museum Exhibits. The museum's exhibits are displayed on two floors, the first of which is in the shape of a five-point Texas starDanilov (2002), p. 687. and the second floor in a pentagon shape. The exhibits on the first floor present a chronological history of early Texas, beginning with the first Texans, the Native Americans, and continuing to the Texian soldiers who fought for Texas independence. Intriguing artifacts on the first level include: The Reading of the Texas Declaration of Independence, a 1936 painting by Charles and Fanny Normann of the men who signed the Texas Declaration of IndependenceMcGaugh (2011), p. 2. and the Lone Star Flag, the oldest known Texas flag from the period of 1839-1846. Personal artifacts once belonging to signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence also comprise a significant portion of the first floor exhibits. The second floor exhibits depict the social and multicultural history of the 1830s and 1840s. Through impressive design, the exhibits portray the daily life and practices of the settlers of the Republic of Texas. The second level's attractions include: a simulated riverboat trip down the Brazos River and an observation deck to view the of the Washington on the Brazos State Historic Site. Annual events ;Texas Independence Day Celebration The largest event for the entire park is the Texas Independence Day Celebration. This celebration occurs every year on the weekend closest to March 2, the actual anniversary of Texas Independence from Mexico. During the celebration weekend visitors are able to tour all the sites in the park free of charge. During the Texas Independence Day celebration visitors will find costumed interpreters, historical re-enactors, special performances, and a variety of demonstrators relating to the Republic of Texas time period. Next year's Texas Independence Celebration will be held on Saturday, March 2, and Sunday, March 3, 2019. ;Juneteenth Heritage Celebration On the 19th of June 1865, Union General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston and made a declaration of freedom ending the bondage of approximately 250,000 enslaved men, women and children in Texas. Since that time, Juneteenth has been celebrated and remembered by picnics, parades, family reunions, pageants, barbecues and games. The Brazos Valley has a rich history in celebrating Juneteenth, including the Juneteenth parade in Brenham, TX, which began in the early 1870s and continues to this day. Washington on the Brazos will observe this important occasion with its Juneteenth Heritage Celebration from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, June 23, 2018 at the park. This family friendly event will include artifact exhibits; music; art displays; prominent guest speakers and historians; church choir performances; food. ;Christmas on the Brazos Begin the holiday season by spending special time at Washington on the Brazos. Activities commence in the early afternoon at Independence Hall and the Star of the Republic Museum and extend into the evening, bringing an 1850s Christmas alive for all. The highlight of the celebration is Candlelight Christmas, from 5:30 p.m. ‚Äì 9 p.m. at Barrington Living History Farm. Meet St. Nick; fall in with some noisy, rowdy revelers; experience the Jones family lighting the Christmas tree; attend an evening service with a traveling minister; and discover how the enslaved people celebrated Christmas. Allow at least one hour to complete the full experience, reservations are highly recommended. Location The Star of the Republic Museum is one of three venues located within the Washington on the Brazos State Historic Site in Washington, Texas. The other two venues located on the Washington-on-the- Brazos State Historic Site are Independence Hall where the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico was signed in 1836; and Barrington Living History Farm, the home of Anson Jones, the last President of the Republic of Texas.Krane (1999), p. 28. The Washington on the Brazos State Historic Site is located in Washington County, Texas. The Star of the Republic Museum is located at 23200 Park Road 12, Washington, Texas. Descendants of the signers Beginning in 2010, the Star of the Republic Museum established a registry of documented lineal descendants of the 60 signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence.McGaugh (2011), p. 1. 59 of these men were elected delegates to the Convention of 1836.

It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1992.Fulford Place, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaFulford Place, National Register of Historic Places History The Italianate garden, designed by the Olmsted Brothers Ontario Heritage Trust plaque After purchasing a patent for Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People in 1890 and making a fortune selling the pills, the Fulfords had a mansion built for them in Brockville, on the shore of the St. Lawrence River where several other beautiful estates were located, many of which were owned by other successful business people. In 1898, the Fulfords commissioned their estate to be built on the King‚Äôs Highway, on the eastern edge of Brockville. Architect Albert W. Fuller from Albany, New York, designed Fulford Place, and it was elaborately decorated in the Beaux-Arts style. It was built between 1899 and 1901, and had 35 rooms making up 20,000 square feet. Since Fulford was an important figure in both the political world and the business scene, entertaining was one of Fulford Place‚Äôs primary functions. The house thus contains a grand hall, a dining room to seat over thirty guests, a spacious veranda, and a rococo-style drawing room for the ladies. A Moorish-style smoking room was adjacent to a billiard room for the gentlemen. Notably, the grounds at Fulford Place were designed by the Olmsted Brothers, and the recently restored formal Italianate garden is a rare and important example of a privately owned Olmsted-designed garden. The property was reduced to three of its original when George Taylor Fulford II was forced to section off prime lots of real estate to sell in order to afford the maintenance of the house. He remained proprietor of Fulford Place until his death, when he bequeathed it to the Ontario Heritage Foundation (now Ontario Heritage Trust). All of its original contents were later donated by his widow and his son, George Taylor Fulford III. Fulford family George Taylor Fulford was born in Brockville in 1852 and attended school in Belleville for business, when he met his future wife, Mary Wilder Fulford ( White). Mary was a Wisconsin socialite and had a ten year courtship with George through letters before they married in 1880. They had three children: Dorothy Marston Fulford (1881‚Äì1949), Martha Harris Fulford (1883-1910), and George Taylor Fulford II (1902-1987). In 1900 George Fulford was appointed to the Senate by Prime Minister Sir Wilfried Laurier, making George both Business man and Senator; however, in 1905 George Fulford passed away after an automobile accident while on a business trip in Newton, Massachusetts. He was the first Canadian to die in a car accident. His daughter Dorothy married Arthur Charles Hardy in 1904, while Martha was married twice before passing away in childbirth in 1910. Mary Fulford lived at Fulford Place with her son George until her passing in 1946. George Fulford II married Josephine Weller and the two resided at Fulford Place with their three children; Martha, Dwight and George III. Museum The Trust did extensive restoration on the house, and opened it to the public as a historic house museum in 1993. It has been interpreted to how it looked in the Edwardian era; this was done relatively accurately because of the existence of early photographs of rooms (taken for insurance purposes) and a collection of original artifacts (not reproductions). Among the original furnishings and artifacts are; a butterfly Steinway piano gifted to Mary Fulford by her husband, and a Tiffany Dragon Fly Lamp. The opulent and lavishly furnished mansion has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada, and is a major tourist attraction in the Brockville area.Ontario Heritage Trust - Fulford Place (Brockville) The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

The first publication, Istorik-Marksist () was published from 1926 to 1941. The second publication, begun in 1931, was known as Bor'ba Klassov (), but in 1937 changed its name to Istoricheskii Zhurnal (). Istorik-Marksist was merged into Istoricheskii Zhurnal in 1941. In 1945 the journal's name was changed to the current Voprosy Istorii. In 1957 the Russian historian √âdourd Burdzhalov was dismissed as deputy editor of the journal after he published an article about the Bolshevik's confusion following the February Revolution in 1917. At that time, it was one of just three journals available to Soviet historians, the others being Istoricheskie Zapiski, which specialised in medieval and modern Russian history, and Vestnik drevnei istorii which dealt with ancient history.Banerjee, Arup.

It was designed by Microchip Technology. MiWi uses small, low- power digital radios based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, and is designed for low-power, cost-constrained networks, such as industrial monitoring and control, home and building automation, remote control, wireless sensors, lighting control, and automated meter reading.MiWi Protocol  Microchip Technology The MiWi protocol is supported on Microchip's SAMR30 (sub- gigahertz) and SAMR21 (2.4 GHz) ARM Cortex-M0+ devices and modules. Legacy MiWi protocol code supporting PIC and dsPIC microcontrollers has been frozen and is no longer recommended for new designs; however, it is still available in the Microchip Library for Applications (MLA) for the MPLAB Integrated Development Environment. The latest, supported protocol stack is available at no cost in the Advanced Software Framework for the Atmel Studio integrated development environment. Protocols Microchip Technology has released a Quick Start Guide, MiWi Software Design Guide and Migration Guide, which present technical information on MiWi.AN1066 MiWi Wireless Networking Protocol Stack, describing the Microchip MiWi stackAN1204 Microchip MiWi P2P Wireless Protocol, focusing on MiWi P2P These are not primarily protocol specifications and are focused on implementing the MiWi protocol on Microchip microcontrollers. As of 2019, interoperable third party implementations have not appeared. Unless they do, it will not be clear if those specifications are complete or accurate enough to serve roles other than supporting Microchip's code or being one more proprietary example of a lightweight WPAN stack. Many developers trying to use WPAN technologies have observed that the competing Zigbee WPAN protocol seems undesirably complex. Accordingly, there exists a technical niche for simpler protocols, of which MiWi is a proprietary example. Software The MiWi protocol is a small foot-print alternative (3K-32K) to Zigbee (40K-180K), which it useful for cost-sensitive applications with limited memory. Although the MiWi software can all be downloaded for free from its official website, it is a proprietary solution that requires use with only with Microchip microcontrollers. The MiWi protocol stack supports star and peer-to-peer wireless-network topologies, useful for simple, short-range, wireless node-to-node communication. Additionally, the stack provides sleeping-node, active-scan and energy-detect features while supporting the low-power requirements of battery-operated devices.

He played hurling at various times with his local clubs Ballyhogue , Oylgate-Glenbrien and Rapparees and with the Wexford senior inter-county team from 1961 until 1974. Playing career=Club= Wilson began his club hurling career with the Ballyhogue club before later moving to Oylgate-Glenbrien. Here he enjoyed his first success by winning a senior county title in 1963. Wilson later moved to the newly formed Rapparees club in Enniscorthy where he won a second county title in 1978. =Inter-county= Wilson first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with the Wexford senior team in 1961. He made his debut that year, however, Wexford were defeated by Kilkenny in the Leinster final. In 1962, Wilson tasted success for the first time when he captured a first Leinster medal as Kilkenny fell by 3-9 to 2-10. A second All-Ireland final meeting with Tipperary in two years beckoned for Wexford and Wilson. The Leinster men got off to a bad start as Tom Moloughney and Se√°n Moloughney scored two goals for Tipp inside the first minute. Wexford fought back and the game remained level for most of the rest of the match. Jimmy O'Brien scored a remarkable goal from all of seventy yards to even up the game again. It was not enough for Wexford as Tipperary won the game by 3-10 to 2-11. Wexford were outclassed in Leinster for the next two years, however, 1965 saw Wilson add a second provincial medal to his collection as arch-rivals Kilkenny fell once again. Yet again Wexford faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. Of all their meetings in recent years this proved to be the most one-sided. Tipp won easily with two unorthodox hand- passed goals by Se√°n McLoughlin. Tipp also scored seven unanswered points in the last quarter to win the game by 2-16 to 0-10. Wilson won his only All-star this year. In 1967, Wilson played a key role in helping Wexford to capture the National Hurling League title. The following year he won his third Leinster title. Kilkenny, who were the reigning All-Ireland champions, were accounted for in the provincial decider on a score line of 3-13 to 4-9. For the fourth time of the decade Wexford subsequently faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final with the Munster men leading by two victories to one. Wilson, however, had never ended up on the winning side. At half-time it looked as if Tipp were cruising to another victory as they took an eight-point lead. Just after the restart Wexford had a Christy Jacob goal disallowed before Tony Doran scored a goal after just six minutes. Tipp fought back; however, it was too late as Wexford won by 5-8 to 3-12. It was Wilson‚Äôs first All-Ireland medal. In a similar pattern to previous years Wexford lost their provincial crown the year after reaching the All-Ireland final. Wilson, however, won a fourth Leinster medal in 1970 as All-Ireland champions Kilkenny fell in the provincial final. Galway were defeated in the penultimate game of the championship, setting up an All-Ireland final meeting with Cork, Wexford‚Äôs nemesis at underage levels. For the first time ever the final would be contested over eighty minutes instead of the usual sixty. The game itself was an exciting affair with a record sixty-four scores and eleven goals in all, however, Wilson did not make the starting fifteen. After a free-flowing game Cork emerged victorious by 6-21 to 5-10. Wilson played in his next Leinster final in 1971. The Kilkenny team of that era, a team often described as the greatest of all-time, provided the opposition on that occasion. In fact, it was the first of five successive defeats at the hands of Kilkenny in Leinster finals for Wexford. In spite of a lack of success in the championship Wilson collected a second National League medal as a substitute in 1973. He retired from inter-county hurling at the start of 1974. =Provincial= Wilson also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province in 1964 as Leinster defeated Munster to take the Railway Cup. Wilson added further Railway Cup medals to his collection in 1965 and 1972.

The club plays in the domestic National League 2 North having won promotion from National League 3 North as champions at the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. The club also competes in the Yorkshire Cup competition and play its home matches at Lockwood Park, which has a capacity of 1,500 with seating for 500. HRUFC also has an academy squad, feeding the senior team with new players. History Rugby football was first played in Huddersfield in 1869 and the club established in 1870. Matches were initially played at the Rifle Field in Trinity Street and then, with the amalgamation of the St John's Cricket Club, at Fartown from 1879. Huddersfield was playing in the top ranks of English clubs when, in August 1895, the town hosted a meeting at the George Hotel and was one of the 20 clubs that resigned from the Rugby Union to set up The Northern Rugby Football Union, which allowed players to be compensated for 'Broken Time.' This meant they could claim for wages lost by playing on Saturdays. They were not allowed to make a living from the game ‚Äì they were not 'professional.' A new club was re-formed and named Huddersfield Old Boys in 1909. The club's first ground was at the United Cricket Club in Luck Lane with changing facilities at the Croppers Arms. World War I blew the whistle on the sport and games were not restarted until 1919 on a ground at Salendine Nook initially before the club took a lease on land at Waterloo. It was here that the club established their current colours of white, claret and gold. A stand was built and changing rooms completed for exclusive rugby use a luxury in those days. But the ground was plagued with drainage problems and another move was contemplated. In the event it was decided to buy the ground outright for ¬£700 and invest in drainage. In 1935 ¬£370 was invested in a new pavilion and bar and ladies were welcomed to a hitherto male bastion and they themselves began the tradition of aftermatch tea making. By 1964 the original pavilion was falling to bits and a new one, costing ¬£11,000, was officially opened by Huddersfield's then MP J P W Mallalieu, himself a former Oxford Blue. In 1946 the club changed their name to Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club. The club sold part of its Waterloo property for ¬£1.4 million to W Morrison's to help fund the purchase of the former brewery estate at Lockwood Park from Bass in 1996 to create a major sports complex backed by a ¬£1.84 million Sport Council lottery grant. The club won the Yorkshire Cup in 2011 for the first time in its history, beating Hull RUFC 25‚Äì18 at York RUFC. The Huddersfield team which won the cup in 1890 was the direct antecedent of the Huddersfield Giants and is unconnected to the current Huddersfield RUFC.

Poulett was the fourth son of John Poulett, 1st Earl Poulett and was born on 11 July 1711. He received his unusual first name in honour of Queen Anne, who was his sponsor at his baptism. Poulett initially stood for election at Bridgwater in the 1768 general election, and although he was initially declared defeated the result was reversed on petition in 1769. He was returned unopposed in the 1774 general election and headed the poll at contested elections in 1780 and 1784. Throughout his career he was generally a supporter of Lord North, though occasionally voting against him. In 1780 Poulett presented to St Mary's Church in Bridgwater a magnificent 17th-century painting of The Descent from the Cross, apparently captured when a Spanish warship was taken a prize. The artist is unknown, although it has been controversially attributed to Murillo. The picture is now used as the altarpiece of the church. On 2 May 1785, he presented to parliament a petition from his constituents for the abolition of the slave trade, making Bridgwater the first town to submit such a petition. However it was largely ignored. Poulett died on 5 July 1785.

The film was directed by Robert Stevenson from a screenplay by Lowell S. Hawley freely based upon Jules Verne's 1868 adventure novel Captain Grant's Children.IN SEARCH OF THE CASTAWAYS Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 29, Iss. 336, (Jan 1, 1962): 171. In Search of the Castaways was Hayley Mills' third film in the series of six for the Disney Studios. Plot In England in the 19th century, Professor Paganel (Maurice Chevalier), a whimsical French geography professor, finds a bottle containing a note which he believes to have been written by the missing Captain John Grant (Jack Gwillim). Paganel and Grant's two teenaged children, Mary (Hayley Mills) and Robert (Keith Hamshere), approach John Glenarvan (Michael Anderson, Jr.) and his father, the wealthy shipping magnate Lord Glenarvan (Wilfrid Hyde-White), the owner of Captain Grant's ship, and persuade them to finance a search expedition. The expedition sets sail and ventures halfway around the world to South America. In the Andes, an earthquake sends them down a mountain on a glacier. A giant condor snatches up Robert but Thalcave (Antonio Cifariello), an Indian chief, rescues him. He later claims to know the whereabouts of Captain Grant. After surviving a tidal wave and a lightning storm, the group discovers that the well-meaning Thalcave was mistaken. Meanwhile, a budding romance develops between young Mary Grant and Lord Glenarvan's son John. They then depart for Australia, where Paganel feels sure they will find Captain Grant. In Melbourne they meet a treacherous gunrunner, Thomas Ayerton (George Sanders), who produces evidence that Captain Grant is in New Zealand. Unaware that Ayerton is the third mate who caused a mutiny on Grant's ship, the search party once more sets sail. Ayerton causes another mutiny and sets the group adrift. They are captured by Maori cannibals, and are imprisoned along with Captain Grant‚Äôs shipmate, Bill Gaye (Wilfrid Brambell), who helps them escape to a volcano. They evade their pursuers by starting an avalanche which triggers an eruption. They finally find Captain Grant, overcome Ayerton and his mutineers, and sail for home. As they all sit around talking, the note that Professor Paganel initially found (and that was supposedly in Captain Grant‚Äôs handwriting) is brought up. Captain Grant states that he never wrote any note, to which Bill says: ‚ÄúThe voice be the voice of a God-fearing man. But the hands are the hands of a forger‚Äù, implying that he imitated Captain Grant‚Äôs handwriting and wrote the note himself. In the final scene, the Professor points out John and Mary stargazing out at the railing, clearly falling for one another.

He worked in film, television, radio and on the stage, starring in Sam Thompson's 1960 play Over the Bridge. Early life Joseph Tomelty was born in Portaferry, the eldest of seven children. His father was known as 'Rollickin' James' for his skill on the fiddle. He left his local primary school aged 12 and was apprenticed to the trade of housepainter, his father's trade. He moved to Belfast and attended classes at Belfast Technical College. Career Tomelty first acted with St Peter's Players and with others in 1937 and 1938 took part in discussions which led to the formation of the Northern Ireland Players on a more professional basis. Radio plays Barnum is Right and Elopement were broadcast in December 1938 and February 1939 respectively. The Northern Ireland Players chose the stage version of Barnum is Right for their first major commercial venture at the Empire Theatre in June 1939. In 1940 the Northern Ireland Players joined forces with the Ulster Theatre and the Jewish Institute Dramatic Society to form the Group Theatre, and in 1942 Tomelty became its general manager remaining in the post until 1951. His play, Idolatry at Innishargie, enjoyed a short run at the Group Theatre in 1942, but The End House, a controversial political play, did not even appear there. The play dealt with, what he described as 'the inhumanity that resulted from the Special Powers Act'. It was however performed at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin in 1944. Meanwhile, his career as a character actor had rapidly developed and a successful stage and film career was underway. In 1948 he was commissioned by the BBC in Belfast to write the weekly radio comedy drama series The McCooeys. This radio series lasted for seven years with Tomelty writing 6,000 word scripts for each episode. He continued to write plays, including his masterpiece, and a modern Irish theatre classic, All Souls' Night in 1948. In England in 1954 he suffered a car accident and, while he recovered, he was never as productive again. Family His brother, Peter Tomelty, was a tenor and recording artist. He married Lena Milligan in 1942,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaryjoseph-to melty-1586249.html They had two daughters together; Frances Tomelty is an actress and the first wife of singer and musician Sting, while Roma Tomelty is also an actress.

She began writing poetry at the age of seven. At seventeen she made her d√©but as a poet by the publication of a poem in the literary magazine TakƒÅpu, edited by Mansur KushƒÅn. Since then she has regularly contributed to literary magazines inside Iran. She has studied Persian Literature at University of Tehran. Pegah Ahamdi has published four books of poetry, On the Final Sol G (1999), Cadence (2001), Writing Footnotes on the Wall of the Family Home (200?), and My These Days Is Throat The actual title of this book is In RuzhƒÅ'yam Galust (ÿß€åŸÜ ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤Ÿáÿß€åŸÖ ⁄ØŸÑŸàÿ≥ÿ™). The accuracy of the translation My These Days Is Throat is to be ascertained. (2004). Her fifth book of poems, To Find Faults The actual title of this book is ƒÄhu KhƒÅni (ÿ¢ŸáŸàÿÆŸàÿßŸÜ€å). Since the writer of these lines is not familiar with this book, the translation To Find Faults is likely to be inaccurate. The following considerations have underlined this translation. According to Dehkhoda in Loghat'nƒÅmeh-ye Dehkhoda (3rd Edition, Tehran University Press, 2006), ƒÄhu (not to be confused with the same word in the meaning of Gazelle) consists of ƒÄ and Huk, where ƒÄ negates the meaning of Huk. Thus ƒÄhu means Fault, Shortcoming, Error or Wrongdoing. The word KhƒÅni refers to KhƒÅndan, To Read. It is therefore very conceivable that ƒÄhu KhƒÅni refers to the disagreeable act or habit of reminding others of their shortcomings or mistakes. Whence the present translation To Find Faults. will be published in the course of this year (2008). She has further published two works of translation from English into Persian, one an anthology of the poems by Sylvia Plath, with the title The Love Song of the Insane Girl (2000), and the other, a translation of the book Haiku: Poetry Ancient and Modern, by Jackie Hardy, with the title Hundred and One Haikus, From Past to Present (2007).

In May 2008, crews constructed two tunnel boring machines at Giardinetti, and two months later the old Rome-Pantano railway was truncated at Giardinetti to allow restructuring part of the old surface line, which forms a part of the new metro. This section, from Montecompatri-Pantano to Parco di Centocelle, opened in 2014. The section between Parco di Centocelle to Lodi opened on 29 June 2015, one further station (San Giovanni) opened in May 2018. The section of Line C further west is partly under construction (to Fori Imperiali-Colosseo with one further station in between) and is due to open in 2024. Planning for an additional station at Piazza Venezia is currently in the planning phase and funding has been secured. Project planning for further extensions crossing the city centre (from Venezia to Clodio- Mazzini) was suspended in 2010. A shortened extension to Ottaviano (thus providing a second interchange with Line A) is again under discussion. In 2009, during preliminary excavations for the station at Piazza Venezia (near the Capitoline Hill) workers found remains of what has been identified as emperor Hadrian's Athenaeum. Route Line C operates on of route (of which is at grade), and serves 22 stations. Of the entire route, about are underground, while the rest is located in the open air. Initially, the planned termini were Pantano (a frazione of the comune of Monte Compatri) in the east and Clodio-Mazzini in the north, but in March 2007, a northward extension along the Via Cassia was announced, with nine more stations to Grottarossa. A depot has been built at Graniti. Once construction is complete, the line will cross Line A not only at San Giovanni but also at Ottaviano, and Line B at Colosseo. At Pigneto, a new railway station is currently being constructed on the FL1 line. At the Colosseo stop a public museum was to be constructed in the station to display archaeological material that was excavated during construction, but the project has been scrapped due to the lack of funds. Instead, a portion of the ruins of the barracks used by the Praetorian Guard will be viewable through a large glass window. The initial plan featured a station at Largo di Torre Argentina in the city center. However, archaeological remains on the site were even more extensive than expected and the station was cancelled. Extensions The following extensions have been studied: * Northward (towards Rome's rail ring) and the Rome-Viterbo railway, which would be connected to the Metro line at Tor di Quinto; this extension would have five stations and would allow for interchange with the FL5 line at Vigna Clara and Tor di Quinto; * A southward extension of one station to Tor Vergata, where a secondary depot might be built; * A northward extension of the east branch from Teano to reach Ponte Mammolo allowing interchange with Line B, with five new stations. This extension would also meet FL2 at Togliatti. Rolling stock Line C is served by 30 AnsaldoBreda Driverless Metro convoys. The metro depot of Line C, the Deposito di Graniti, which extends over 21.7 hectare, is located between the station Graniti and the Eastern terminus Monte Compatri-Pantano. It additionally serves as the maintenance and control center of Line C.

The film is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by J. L. Carr, and stars Colin Firth, Kenneth Branagh, Natasha Richardson and Patrick Malahide. The screenplay was by Simon Gray. Set in rural Yorkshire during the summer of 1920, the film follows a destitute World War I veteran employed to carry out restoration work on a Medieval mural discovered in a rural church while coming to terms with the after-effects of the war. The film was shot during the summer of 1986 and featured an original score by Howard Blake. The film has been neglected since its 1987 cinema release and it was only in 2004 that an original 35 mm film print was discovered, due to the intervention of a fan.Hilary Whitney \\"How I found Branagh's lost movie \\" in The Daily Telegraph, 21 February 2005 Plot Set in 1920, the film follows the experiences of Tom Birkin (Colin Firth), who has been employed under a bequest to carry out restoration work on a Medieval mural discovered in a church in the small rural community of Oxgodby, Yorkshire. The escape to the idyllic countryside is cathartic for Birkin, haunted by his experiences in World War I. Birkin soon fits into the slow-paced life of the remote village, and over the course of a summer uncovering a painting begins to lose his trauma-induced stammer and tics. In particular, he forms a close friendship with archaeologist James Moon (Kenneth Branagh), another veteran, who like Birkin has been emotionally scarred by the war. Moon is employed in the village under the same bequest, working to uncover a mysterious lost grave, but is more interested in discovering the remains of an earlier Saxon church building in the field next to the churchyard. Birkin becomes accepted into the Nonconformist family of Mr Ellerbeck the station master (Jim Carter), with whom he dines on Sundays; the hospitality of the chapel congregation is contrasted against the established church, which has consigned the penniless Birkin to sleep in the church belfry. Ellerbeck's children eventually persuade Birkin to preach a sermon at a nearby Methodist chapel. Birkin also forms an emotional, albeit unspoken, attachment to Alice Keach (Natasha Richardson), the young wife of the vicar. The vicar (Patrick Malahide) is portrayed unsympathetically as an obstruction to the work in the church, viewing the medieval painting as symptomatic of the superstition prevalent in the community. Cast A Month in the Country featured film debuts or early roles of several notable British actors. Although it was the third cinema feature film to cast Colin Firth, it was his first lead role. Similarly, it was Kenneth Branagh's first cinema film, and Natasha Richardson's second. Conversely, it was the last role of David Garth who died in May 1988.Cast information at amitc.org.

In contrast to the book, which is narrated as a recollection by Birkin as an old man, the film is set entirely in the 1920s, except for a brief moment towards the end. In initial drafts of the screenplay, Gray had included a narrator, but O'Connor felt this was not the correct way to present the story: > I felt that if I couldn't do it in the present, suggesting internal pain by > performance, then I wouldn't really want to do it at all.Screenplay at > amitc.org.

Levisham railway station on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway and the surrounding countryside was the setting for the Ellerbeck's house. To compensate for the lack of budget, a very tight shooting schedule was planned over 28 days, during which Kenneth Branagh was only available for two weeks and was performing on-stage nightly in London. Despite being set in Yorkshire, the majority of location filming was moved to Buckinghamshire, although Levisham railway station and the surrounding area in North Yorkshire were used.

Interiors were shot at Bray Studios in Berkshire. The church, which is a main location for the film, was substantially set-dressed. Despite having several original medieval wall paintings, the largest addition was the creation of the medieval mural by artist Margot Noyes.

Retrieved 6 August 2008 =Music= The soundtrack of the film was written by Howard Blake, and is scored entirely for string orchestra in the style of early 20th Century British music. Blake notes that the style chosen was intended to complement and contrast recordings of classical music during particular scenes: Verdi's Quattro pezzi sacri was used during the uncovering of the mediaeval mural and a flashback montage of the First World War which opened the film used an excerpt from Schubert's Deutsche Messe (D. 872) \\"Zum Sanctus: Heilig, heilig ist der Herr\\". Howard Blake recalls: \\"I went to a viewing and saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I explained that I loved the film and I thought the choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small ‚Äî and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only.\\"Score at amitc.org. Retrieved 31 July 2008 Blake decided to compose his score to match the key of the Schubert Mass, in order for the music to continue seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key.Howard Blake Official Website . Retrieved 22 July 2008 Due to the small budget of the film, Blake agreed \\"in lieu of a reasonable fee\\" to retain the copyright to his music.

His brief term also saw several scientific enterprises being initiated: he was, for instance, Alexander von Humboldt's sponsor for his American expedition. He was instrumental in sending Valentin de Foronda as General Consul of Spain in Philadelphia, (1801‚Äì1807), and as Spanish Plenipotentiary Minister in the USA 'til the nomination by the \\"Junta\\" of Luis de Onis in 1809. Resenting the conservative and ultra-catholic policies of the Spanish court, he embraced the pro-French government of Jos√© I Bonaparte once Napoleon invaded Spain and replaced the Bourbon dynasty with his own brother Joseph (Jos√©). After publicly acknowledging Jos√© I as lawful King of Spain, Urquijo was called back to court and became Prime Minister again. He remained in office during all of the reign of Jos√© I, from 7 July 1808 to 27 June 1813. However, the failed Napoleonic invasion resulted in Spain being led into a state of war, and he was unable to carry out any policy apart from helping the French forces of Jos√© I, brother of Napoleon, undertake an ineffective war against the Spanish people. Upon the French defeat, Urquijo fled along with Joseph I across the Pyrenees to France into exile, embracing the French nationality. Outlawed in Spain, he died in exile in Paris, in 1817.

Shortly after his birth the family moved to 'Galahill' which overlooks part of the Borderland known as 'Scotland's Eden'. The family then moved to Selkirk when he was still an infant. His father, Henry Brown, was one of the pioneers of the woollen industry in the district - responsible for building the first part of Ettrick Mills. Together with his brother James, he founded the firm J & H Brown & Co. in 1835. Their father William was also associated with the venture and in 1837 the three men were created honorary burgesses of Selkirk in recognition of the benefits they had brought to the town and the people. J.B. was educated at Selkirk Grammar School and the Edinburgh Institution before joining his father's firm where he proved an excellent designer. From an early age he studied music and architecture. In addition to poetry, he received lessons from the late Arthur Piegal R.S.A.. and had a picture of St Mary's Loch hung at the exhibition of the Royal Scottish Academy.  Works  His first love though was poetry. He wrote prose and verse for various papers and periodicals, his first efforts being printed in The Scotsman. Longham, Green & Co. London in 1869 also published a volume of his poems. A new and enlarged version was published in 1883 by Kegan Paul, Trench & Co. London and another by Blackwood in 1896.

His writings cover a fairly wide variety of themes - love, death, sorrow, regret, longing, religion, nature, philosophy and patriotism etc. as well as hymnology and political speeches. Undoubtedly the most popular of his poems is \\"Auld Selkirk Toon\\" the words of which were put to music by G. R. Colledge and adopted as one of the town's songs at Selkirk's great annual festival - the common riding.  Marriage  In 1858 J.B. Selkirk married Agnes Brown Bucham, a daughter of Mr and Mrs Robert Bucham of Hardacres, Kelso. They lived at 'Cascade', a house overlooking the Tweed midway between Selkirk and Galashiels before moving to Thornfield, Selkirk which was built by himself in 1870. he also built a villa in Cannes which he named Yarrow. Agnes to whom he was totally devoted was his incentive to write. The influence of her strong character helped and upheld him and to her memory were written some of his finest yet saddest poems.  Later life  J.B. Selkirk was twice invited to become provost of Selkirk after the passing of the education act he was returned as member of the Selkirk school board. He was the last Deacon and the last surviving member in the year 1899 of the ancient cooperation of Selkirk weavers, who obtained custody of the English flag from Flodden field. He was also responsible for the preservation of the parchment and seal of the cooperation which dated back to 1600. Agnes died in 1874 aged 37 after bearing him 9 children. the early death of his wife was the deterioration of J.B. Selkirk. Full of sadness he seemed unable to sustain effort in his writings. For many years his health was very poor. Several years before his death he was a complete invalid. He died on Christmas Day 1904 his resting place is beside that of his wife in the old churchyard of his dearly loved ' Auld Selkirk Toon'. A memorial was erected in September 1931 in honour of J.B.

History On June 30, 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed Public Law 96-288 authorizing the Bogue Chitto National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Washington and St. Tammany Parishes, Louisiana, and Pearl River County, Mississippi. Since that time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been acquiring bottomland hardwood habitat in the Pearl River Basin. On December 13, 1989, Congress authorized a boundary expansion for Bogue Chitto NWR that included an additional of bottomland hardwoods in St. Tammany Parish. To date, some have been placed under refuge management. The refuge is still in an acquisition phase. Access Access is primarily by boat on the refuge's Louisiana side and road access is available on the refuge's Mississippi side. In the summer of 2002, a new walking trail was unveiled on the Louisiana side of the Refuge that allows access into the interior of Bogue Chitto's habitat. Wildlife and habitat The refuge is home to hundreds of bird species. The most abundant species are the Neotropical migrants, including the prothonotary and Swainson's warblers, tyrant flycatchers, yellow-billed cuckoo, and white-eyed vireo. In smaller numbers found on the refuge are migratory game birds such as American woodcock and wild turkey, wading birds such as egrets and herons, waterfowl such as wood duck, and raptors such as hawks and owls. Endangered and threatened species found on the refuge are bald eagle, ringed map turtle, gopher tortoise, inflated heelsplitter, and Gulf sturgeon. White-tail deer, squirrel, turkey and wild boar hunting and fishing are offered to the public. Bogue Chitto NWR is primarily composed of bottomland hardwood habitat interlaced by the Bogue Chitto and Pearl river systems. Numerous sloughs, bayous and lakes are located on the refuge. Water levels fluctuate by several feet from their low point in the summer to winter/spring flood stage. Over 90% of the refuge can be flooded during seasonal high river periods. The mixed hardwood forest includes Water oak, Overcup Oak, American Elm, Sweetgum, and Red Maple on higher elevations and Bald Cypress, Water Tupelo, and Black Tupelo along the wettest areas. Mid-story in mixed hardwoods includes American Hophornbeam, Southern Arrowwood, Virginia Sweetspire and reproduction of the overstory. Typical mid-story plants along the sloughs and bayous are Buttonbush, Eastern Swampprivet, and Water Elm.

It is nicknamed the Alleluia Symphony because of Haydn's use of a Gregorian Alleluia chant in the opening movement. Description The Alleluia chant of the first movement has been confused with the principal melodic line in the finale of Mozart's Symphony No. 41 in C major.Peter Brown, \\"Eighteenth-Century Traditions and Mozart's \\"Jupiter\\" Symphony K.551\\" The Journal of Musicology 20 2 (2003): 187, footnote 65. Mozart did use this Alleluia chant melody for his Alleluia Canon, K. 553, written shortly after he completed his C major symphony.HC Robbins Landon, _Haydn: Chronicle and Works_ , 5 vols, (Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 1976-) v. 1, _Haydn: the Early Years, 1732-1765_ The Alleluia theme of the first movement The work is scored for flute, two oboes, bassoon, two horns, trumpets, timpani,H. C. Robbins Landon, The Symphonies of Joseph Haydn. London: Universal Edition & Rockliff (1955): 661. \\"Pts. for 2 clarini (trpts.) and timp. possibly authentic (as yet no copies of these pts. have been found.\\" and strings with continuo. The use of timpani in this symphony remains an unresolved matter. In his cycle, for example, Antal Dorati omits them.Hodgson (1976): 58, footnote. Several more recent performances, however, have included timpani. The work is in three movements: #Allegro, #Andante, in G major #Tempo di Menuet, pi√π tosto allegro, The Alleluia motif dominates the first movement. It is the first theme; the second theme is also derived from it and it is also included in the closing material of the exposition. In the development, after the first theme is restated, the first three notes of the motif (do-re-mi) are repeated seven times at different pitch levels against sixteenth-note accompaniment.Brown, A. Peter, The Symphonic Repertoire (Volume 2). Indiana University Press (), pp. 96 (2002). The second movement contains numerous solo concertante passages for the flute.Daniel Heartz, Haydn, Mozart, and the Viennese School, 1740-1780, Norton 1995 , The rare choice of the dominant key for a second movement (subdominant was more common in Haydn) was likely because G major was a favorable key for the flute. Mark Ferraguto has discussed Haydn's deliberate use of spare instrumental scoring and minimal melodic material in the trio of the symphony.

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the New York Giants and Boston Braves. Baseball career He began his professional baseball career in at the age of 18 with the Winston-Salem Twins of the Piedmont League. In he joined the Wilkes-Barre Barons where he posted a .333 batting average in 98 games, winning the Most Valuable Player Award for the New York‚ÄìPennsylvania League. The Barons sold Spohrer's contract to John McGraw's New York Giants for $10,000, a record for a Class B player at the time. Spohrer made his major league debut with the New York Giants on April 13, 1928 at the age of 25 but, after only two games, he was traded along with Virgil Barnes, Ben Cantwell and Bill Clarkson to the Boston Braves for Joe Genewich. He served as a backup catcher for the Braves working behind Zack Taylor in 1928. In 1929, Taylor was traded to the Chicago Cubs and Spohrer became the Braves starting catcher, posting a .272 batting average with 21 doubles and 48 runs batted in. Although he led National League catchers in errors, he finished second in games caught and third in putouts. Spohrer had his best season offensively in 1930 when he posted a .361 on-base percentage, a .441 slugging percentage and led the Braves with a .317 batting average in 112 games. That season, a lively ball wound with special Australian wool was used by major league baseball, resulting in a league batting average that was above .300 for the only time in baseball history. In , the National League introduced a new, heavier ball to counteract the prodigious offensive statistics of the previous year. The raised stitching on the ball allowed pitchers to grip the ball better and throw sharper curveballs. From 1933 to 1935 Spohrer shared catching duties with Shanty Hogan who had been obtained from the New York Giants. In February 1936, Spohrer was released to the Columbus Red Birds of the American Association. He decided to retire as a baseball player at the age of 32 rather than play in the minor leagues. Spohrer is remembered for a game in against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field when, he tried to distract one of baseball's greatest hitters during an at bat. Rogers Hornsby, who had been Spohrer's teammate on the Braves in before being traded to the Cubs, was known for his love of a good steak dinner. As Hornsby stepped up to home plate to take his turn at bat, Spohrer made an attempt to distract him from his hitting by talking about the great steaks available from a butcher back home in Boston. Hornsby replied, \\"Is that so?\\" as the first pitch was a called strike. Spohrer proceeded to tell Hornsby that his wife was also an extremely capable cook as strike two was called. Spohrer continued with his ruse by telling Hornsby that during his next visit to Boston, he was welcome to the Spohrer household to try one of these steaks whereupon, Hornsby proceeded to hit the next pitch out of the park for a home run. After rounding the bases and touching home plate, Hornsby was said to have asked Spohrer, \\"What night shall we make it, Al?\\" In January , Spohrer tried his hand at boxing, losing in four rounds by technical knockout to Chicago White Sox player Art Shires at the Boston Garden. Coincidentally, the two players became roommates when Shires joined the Braves in 1932. Career statistics In an 8-year major league career, Spohrer played in 756 games, accumulating 575 hits in 2,218 at bats for a .259 career batting average along with 6 home runs, 199 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .301.

It is designed for children between the ages of 8 and 14 years old and has a focus on teamwork, cooperation and collaborative play. The company received funding from well-known investors including Shelby Bonnie (co-founder and former CEO of CNET Networks) and Charles River Ventures. Dizzywood was launched into public beta in November, 2007 and has grown rapidly, reaching over 400,000 monthly global visitors. Most visitors come from the United States and other English-speaking countries. The game is a visual chat and social game application similar to Club Penguin or Habbo Hotel, with adventure and quest components similar to RuneScape and other MMO games. It was free to play until the introduction of bonuses and extras that required paying to be a \\"Gold\\" or \\"Silver Explorer\\". The game officially closed December 31, 2010. The Avatars Players can select and customize an avatar upon registration and are immediately placed in-world. The avatars appear as stylized cartoon depictions of human children while many of the non-player characters in Dizzywood appear as anthropomorphic animals. The exploration theme of Dizzywood is immediately apparent as new avatars are equipped with hiking clothes and a backpack. A distinguishing feature of Dizzywood is that players can completely alter their appearance at any time using a feature called Change Your Look. Players can express their thoughts and feelings via online chat or visually through the use of emotes (happy, angry, etc.) that can be sent to other players. You can now write a message below your name after you become a paying member. Gold Explorers can do many things such has \\"gold only\\" missions. They also get to buy certain clothes and get a mansion with 6 rooms (8 including the main room and the grounds) to decorate any way they choose. Environment Dizzywood's environment ranges from forest to jungle to beaches. There is even a town in the sky and an underground hideout. Each place has a host that updates players on the latest things happening around town. Activities and Events There are many activities and events in Dizzywood. Most activity takes place in the form of mini-games and group events such as growing a plant or tree or finding a treasure in a rock pile. The site also produces several daily events, called Dizzy Activities, that follow short story-arcs and typically unfold over a four-day period each week. Most of the story-driven activities involve players attempting to defeat the game's arch-villain, Emperor Withering. For example, a recent story-line encouraged players to clean up pollution and fix broken machines that were destroyed by Withering's henchmen. From finishing a mission you can receive a special item, coins, or it can unlock other related missions. Closing Dizzywood was said to close on December 31, 2010, but it remained in the US until January 12, 2011. App On September 20, 2012, Dizzywood posted an app at the iTunes store. This app was later updated on October 10, 2012 with new levels. This app is a game in the style of Dizzwood, where the player moves around the 'diamonds' to get three or over in a row. If you get a certain kind and number of one of the coloured diamonds, you earn enough points to destroy the swamp creatures. The objective of this game is to 'save the swamp' and there are many levels to do so. This was designed by the creators of Dizzywood, Rocket Paper Scissors.

Using steam power, riverboats were developed during that time which could navigate in shallow waters as well as upriver against strong currents. After the development of railroads, passenger traffic gradually switched to this faster form of transportation, but steamboats continued to serve Mississippi River commerce into the early 20th century. A small number of steamboats are used for tourist excursions into the 21st century. Delta Queen at Paducah, Kentucky, 2007. \\"Saloon of Mississippi River Steamboat Princess\\" (Adrien Persac, 1861), showing elaborate interior of an prewar Mississippi steamboat Geography The Mississippi is one of the world‚Äôs great rivers. It spans of length as measured using its northernmost west fork, the Missouri River, which starts in the Rocky Mountains in Montana, joining the Mississippi proper in the state of Missouri. The Ohio River and Tennessee River are other tributaries on its east, and the Arkansas, Platte and Red River of Texas on the west. The Mississippi itself starts at Lake Itasca in Minnesota, and the river wends its way through the center of the country, forming parts of the boundaries of ten states, dividing east and west, and furthering trade and culture. Background Steamboats on the Mississippi benefited from technology and political changes. The US bought the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803. At the time, a semi-bankrupt Napoleon was attempting to extend his hegemony over Europe in what came to be known as the Napoleonic Wars. As a result, the US was then free to expand westward out of the Ohio valley and into the Great Plains and the Southwest. The success of the Charlotte Dundas in Scotland in 1801 and Robert Fulton's Clermont on the Hudson River in 1807 proved the concept of the steamboat. At this time, walking beam mill engines, of the Boulton and Watt variety, were dropped onto wood barges with paddles to create an instant powerboat. The overhead engines of the \\"walking beam\\" type became the standard Atlantic Seaboard paddle engine for the next 80 years. For smaller boats, Watt perfected the side-lever engine with the engine cut down using side bell-cranks to lower the center of gravity. Sidewheel paddlers were the first to enter the scene. In 1811 the steamer New Orleans was built in Pittsburgh for Fulton and Livingston. Fulton started steamboat service between Natchez and New Orleans. The War of 1812 caused political upheaval in the south, particularly with the Royal Navy blockade of the US Gulf Coast ports but after the Treaty of Ghent and resumption of peace, New Orleans was firmly American, after passing through French and Spanish hands. New Orleans became the great port on the mouth of the Mississippi. Golden age of steamboats \\"Enterprise on her fast trip to Louisville, 1815\\" The historical roots of the prototypical Mississippi steamboat, or Western Rivers steamboat, can be traced to designs by easterners like Oliver Evans, John Fitch, Daniel French, Robert Fulton, Nicholas Roosevelt, James Rumsey and John Stevens.Johnson, pp. 1-16 In the span of just six years the evolution of the prototypical Mississippi steamboat would be well underway. *New Orleans, or Orleans, was the first Mississippi steamboat. Launched in 1811 at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for a company organized by Robert Livingston and Robert Fulton, her designer, she was a large, heavy side-wheeler with a deep draft.. An image of a model replica of the New Orleans reveals her form. Her low-pressure Boulton and Watt steam engine operated a complex power train that was also heavy and inefficient. *Comet was the second Mississippi steamboat.. \\"The second steamboat of the West was a diminutive vessel called the 'Comet.' Daniel D. Smith was the owner, and D. French the builder of this boat. Her machinery was on a plan for which French had obtained a patent in 1809.\\" Launched in 1813 at Pittsburgh for Daniel D. Smith, she was much smaller than the New Orleans. With an engine and power train of Daniel French's design and manufacture, the Comet was the first Mississippi steamboat to be powered by a light weight and efficient high-pressure engine turning a stern paddle wheel.. \\"The first departure from the Boulton and Watt type of engine was the French oscillating cylinder engine with which the first three steamboats built by the Brownsville group were equipped- the Comet (25 tons, 1813), the Despatch (25 tons, 1814), and the Enterprise (75 tons, 1814). The first of these was not a success, and the Despatch made no name for herself; but the Enterprise was one of the best of the early western steamboats.\\" *Vesuvius was the third Mississippi steamboat.. \\"The Vesuvius is the next in this record. She was built by Mr. Fulton, at Pittsburgh, for a company, the several members of which resided at New York, Philadelphia, and New Orleans. She sailed under the command of Capt. Frank Ogden, for New Orleans, in the spring of 1814.\\" Launched in 1814 at Pittsburgh for the company headed by Robert Livingston and Robert Fulton, her designer, she was very similar to the New Orleans.. \\"The first steamboats were too heavy and required too much power and too much depth of water to be practicable on most parts of the Mississippi-Ohio River system.\\" *Enterprise, or Enterprize, was the fourth Mississippi steamboat.. \\"The Enterprise was No. 4 of the Western steamboat series.\\" Launched in 1814 at Brownsville, Pennsylvania for the Monongahela and Ohio Steam Boat Company, she was a dramatic departure from Fulton's boats. The Enterprise - featuring a high- pressure steam engine, a single stern paddle wheel, and shoal draft - proved to be better suited for use on the Mississippi than Fulton's boats.. \\"She had a shallow draft; Latrobe, inspecting a shoal the Enterprize passed daily, wrote [to Robert Fulton on 9 August 1814] that no boat of greater than 2' 6\\" could pass in low water.\\" The Enterprise clearly demonstrated the suitability of French's design during her epic voyage from New Orleans to Brownsville, a distance of more than performed against the powerful currents of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. *Washington was launched in 1816 at Wheeling, West Virginia for Henry Shreve and partners.. George White built the boat and Daniel French constructed the engine and drive train at Brownsville. She was the first steamboat with two decks, the predecessor of the Mississippi steamboats of later years. The upper deck was reserved for passengers and the main deck was used for the boiler, increasing the space below the main deck for carrying cargo. With a draft of , she was propelled by a high-pressure, horizontally mounted engine turning a single stern paddle wheel. In the spring of 1817 the Washington made the voyage from New Orleans to Louisville in 25 days, equalling the record set two years earlier by the Enterprise, a much smaller boat.. \\"Not only was the Washington the largest steamboat on the western rivers at the time of her construction, but she outperformed all previously built steamboats and established a high reputation for herself and for Shreve.\\" The Kate Adams, built in 1898 (the third boat of that name), was the fastest and best equipped on the river, and one of the most successful - with her steel hull, she survived until 1927. At one time she was under the command of famed Captain Grant Marsh.Hanson, Joseph Mills. The Conquest of the Missouri: Being the Story of the Life and Exploits of Captain Grant Marsh, pp. 421-2, Murray Hill Books, New York and Toronto, 1909, 1937, 1946. In the 1810s there were 20 boats on the river; by the 1830s there were more than 1200. By the 1820s, with the Southern states joining the Union and the land converted to cotton plantations so indicative of the Antebellum South, methods were needed to move the bales of cotton, rice, timber, tobacco, and molasses. The steamboat was perfect. America boomed in the age of Jackson. Population moved west, and more farms were established. In the 1820s steamers were fueled first by wood, then coal, which pushed barges of coal from Pittsburgh to New Orleans. Regular steamboat commerce began between Pittsburgh and Louisville. Construction of the vessels Vessels were made of wood‚Äîtypically ranging in length from 40 to nearly in length, 10 to wide, drawing only about one to five feet of water loaded, and in fact it was commonly said that they could \\"navigate on a heavy dew.\\" The boats had kingposts or internal masts to support hogchains, or iron trusses, which prevented the hull from sagging. A second deck was added, the Texas Deck, to provide cabins and passenger areas. All was built from wood. Stairs, galleys, parlors were also added. Often the boats became quite ornate with wood trim, velvet, plush chairs, gilt edging and other trimmings sometimes featured as per the owner's taste and budget. Wood burning boilers were forward center to distribute weight. The engines were also amidships, or at the stern depending on if the vessel was a sternwheeler or sidewheeler. Two rudders were fitted to help steer the ship. Vessels, on average, only lasted about five years due to the wooden hulls being breached, poor maintenance, fires, general wear and tear, and the common boiler explosion. Early trips up the Mississippi River took three weeks to get to the Ohio. Later, with better pilots, more powerful engines and boilers, removal of obstacles and experienced rivermen knowing where the sand bars were, the figure was reduced to 4 days. Collisions and snags were constant perils. The steamers Natchez The Belle of Louisville flying the Jolly Roger during the 2006 Great Steamboat Race. =Natchez I= The first Natchez was a low pressure sidewheel steamboat built in New York City in 1823. It originally ran between New Orleans and Natchez, Mississippi, and later catered to Vicksburg, Mississippi. Its most notable passenger was Marquis de Lafayette, the French hero of the American Revolutionary War, in 1825. Fire destroyed it, while in New Orleans, on September 4, 1835. =Natchez II= Natchez II was the first built for Captain Thomas P. Leathers, at Crayfish Bayou, and ran from 1845 to 1848. It was a fast two-boiler boat, long, with red smokestacks, that sailed between New Orleans and Vicksburg, Mississippi. It was built in Cincinnati, Ohio, Leathers sold it in 1848. It was abandoned in 1852. =Natchez III= Natchez III was funded by the sale of the first. It was long. Leathers operated it from 1848 to 1853. On March 10, 1866, it sank at Mobile, Alabama due to rotting. =Natchez IV= Natchez IV was built in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was long, had six boilers, and could hold 4,000 bales of cotton. It operated for six weeks. On January 1, 1854, the ship collided with the Pearl at Plaquemine, Louisiana, causing the Pearl to sink. A wharf fire on February 5, 1854 at New Orleans caused it to burn down, as did 10-12 other ships. =Natchez V= Natchez V was also built in Cincinnati, as Captain Leathers returned there quickly after the destruction of the third. It was also six boilers, but this one could hold 4,400 cotton bales. This one was used by Leathers until 1859. In 1860 it was destroyed while serving as a wharfboat at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. =Natchez VI= Natchez VI was again a Cincinnati-built boat. It was long. The capacity was 5,000 cotton bales but the power remained the same. It helped transport Jefferson Davis from his river plantation home on the Mississippi River after he heard he was chosen president of the Confederacy. Even after the war, Davis would insist on using Leather's boats to transport him to and from his plantation, Brierfield. Natchez VI was also used to transport Confederate troops to Memphis, Tennessee. After Union invaders captured Memphis, the boat was moved to the Yazoo River. On March 13, 1863, it was burned either by accident or to keep it out of Union hands at Honey Island. Remains were raised from the river in 2007. =Natchez VIII= Natchez VIII was launched August 2, 1879 by the Cincinnati Marine Ways. It was long, with a beam of , floor, and hold depth. It had eight steel boilers that were long and had a diameter of , and thirteen engines. It had 47 elegant staterooms. Camp scenes of Natchez Indians wardancing and sunworshipping ornamented the fore and aft panels of the main cabin, which also had stained glass windows depicting Indians. The total cost of the boat was $125,000. Declaring that the War was over, on March 4, 1885, Leathers raised the American flag when the new Natchez passed by Vicksburg, the first time he hoisted the American flag on one of his ships since 1860. By 1887 lack of business had stymied the Natchez. In 1888 it was renovated back to perfect condition for $6000. In January 1889 it burned down at Lake Providence, Louisiana. Captain Leathers, deciding he was too old to build a new Natchez, retired. Jefferson Davis sent a letter of condolences on January 5, 1889, to Leathers over the loss of the boat. Much of the cabin was salvageable, but the hull broke up due to sand washing within. Improved navigation In 1824 Congress passed an \\"Act to Improve the Navigation of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers\\" and \\"to remove sand bars on the Ohio and planters, sawyers, and snags on the Mississippi\\". The Army Corps of Engineers was given the job. In 1829, there were surveys of the two major obstacles on the upper Mississippi, the Des Moines Rapids and the Rock Island Rapids, where the river was shallow and the riverbed was rock. The Des Moines Rapids were about long and, traveling upriver, began just above the mouth of the Des Moines River at Keokuk, Iowa. The Rock Island Rapids were between Rock Island and Moline, Illinois. Both rapids were considered virtually impassable. The Army Corps of Engineers recommended the excavation of a deep channel at the Des Moines Rapids, but work did not begin until after Lieutenant Robert E. Lee endorsed the project in 1837. In 1848, the Illinois and Michigan Canal was built to connect the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan via the Illinois River near Peru, Illinois. The Corps later also began excavating the Rock Island Rapids. By 1866, it had become evident that excavation was impractical, and it was decided to build a canal around the Des Moines Rapids. That canal opened in 1877, but the Rock Island Rapids remained an obstacle. St. Louis The St. Louis levee in 1857 St. Louis became an important trade center, not only for the overland route for the Oregon and California trails, but as a supply point for the Mississippi. Rapids north of the city made St. Louis the northernmost navigable port for many large boats. The Zebulon Pike and his sisters soon transformed St. Louis into a bustling boom town, commercial center, and inland port. By the 1830s, it was common to see more than 150 steamboats at the St. Louis levee at one time. Immigrants flooded into St. Louis after 1840, particularly from Germany. During Reconstruction, rural Southern blacks flooded into St. Louis as well, seeking better opportunity. By the 1850s, St. Louis had become the largest U. S. city west of Pittsburgh, and the second-largest port in the country, with a commercial tonnage exceeded only by New York. James Eads was a famed engineer who ran a shipyard and first built riverboats in the 1850s, then armed riverboats and finally the legendary bridge over the Mississippi. His Mound City Ironworks and shipyard was famous, and featured often in the naming of vessels. Memphis Historic aerial view of Memphis (1870) Memphis became another major port on the Mississippi. It was the slave port. Hence the city was contested in the Civil War. The First Battle of Memphis was a naval battle fought on the Mississippi River immediately above the city of Memphis on June 6, 1862, during the American Civil War. The engagement was witnessed by many of the citizens of Memphis. It resulted in a crushing defeat for the Rebels, and marked the virtual eradication of a Confederate naval presence on the river. Despite the lopsided outcome, the Union Army failed to grasp its strategic significance. Its primary historical importance is that it was the last time civilians with no prior military experience were permitted to command ships in combat. Tom Lee Park on the Memphis riverfront is named for an African-American riverworker who became a civic hero. Tom Lee could not swim. Nevertheless, he single- handedly rescued thirty-two people from drowning when the steamer M.E. Norman sank in 1925. Washington, Louisiana Washington, Louisiana, is not located directly on the Mississippi River; it is more than 30 miles west of the Mississippi on Bayou Courtableau. Nevertheless, the port there was the largest between New Orleans and St. Louis during much of the 19th century. Products such as cotton, sugar, and livestock were brought to Washington overland or by small boat and then transferred to the steam packets for shipment to New Orleans. By the mid-19th century, Washington developed a thriving trade and became the most important port in the vicinity of St. Landry Parish. This can be seen in the number of steamers that used the port and in the volume of freight. In 1860 there were 93 steam packets operating in the Bayou Courtableau trade, as compared with 90 in Bayou Lefourche and 94 in Bayou Teche. An 1877 tabulation showed the total quantity of goods shipped from Washington to New Orleans: 30,000 bales of cotton, 32,000 sacks of cotton seed, 3,000 hogsheads of sugar, 5,800 barrels of molasses, 30,000 dozen poultry, As many as 93 packets came to Washington during the steamboat era which ended in 1900. Mark Twain Many of the works of Mark Twain deal with or take place near the Mississippi River. One of his first major works, Life on the Mississippi, is in part a history of the river, in part a memoir of Twain's experiences on the river, and a collection of tales that either take place on or are associated with the river. Twain's most famous work, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, is largely a journey down the river. The novel works as an episodic meditation on American culture with the river having multiple different meanings including independence, escape, freedom, and adventure. Twain himself worked as a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi for a few years. A steamboat pilot needed a vast knowledge of the ever-changing river to be able to stop at any of the hundreds of ports and wood-lots along the river banks. Twain meticulously studied 2,000 miles (3,200 km) of the Mississippi for two and a half years before he received his steamboat pilot license in 1859. While training, he convinced his younger brother Henry to work with him. Henry died on June 21, 1858, when the steamboat he was working on, the Pennsylvania, exploded. Boiler explosions Between 1811 and 1853, an estimated 7,000 fatalities occurred as a result of catastrophic boiler explosions on steamboats operating on the Mississippi and its tributaries. Due to a combination of poor boiler construction and unsafe operation, steamboat explosions were a frequent occurrence. Charles Dickens remarked on the issue in his 1842 travelogue American Notes, writing, \\"...[American] steamboats usually blow up one or two a week in the season.\\" Boilers used in early Mississippi steamboats were constructed from many small pieces of riveted cast iron, as the process to produce larger, stronger sheets of metal had not yet been developed. Most suffered from poor workmanship in their construction, and were prone to failure. The inherent danger of these boilers was further compounded by widespread unsafe practices in their operation. Steamboat engines were routinely pushed well beyond their design limits, tended by engineers who often lacked a full understanding of the engine's operating principles. With a complete absence of regulatory oversight, most steamboats were not adequately maintained or inspected, leading to more frequent catastrophic failures. Due to the vast superiority riverboats then held over all forms of land transportation, passengers were willing to accept the high risk of a boiler explosion. Boat operators were not required to carry and kind of insurance and were not held liable for accidents, and so had little incentive to improve safety. Only after a great number of tragedies would this situation change. In 1825, the explosion of the \\"Teche\\" killed 60. The \\"Ohio\\" and the \\"Macon\\" both exploded the following year in 1826; the \\"Union\\" and the \\"Hornet\\" in 1827; the \\"Grampus\\" in 1828; the \\"Patriot\\" and the \\"Kenawa\\" in 1829; the \\"Car of Commerce\\" and the \\"Portsmouth\\" in 1830; and the \\"Moselle\\" in 1838. Mark Twain described a boiler explosion which occurred aboard the steamboat \\"Pennsylvania\\" in 1858. Among the injured passengers was his brother, Henry Clemens, who had been fatally scalded by steam. Henry was taken to an improvised hospital, but died shortly after while accompanied by Twain. Twain later wrote of his brother's death, recounting, \\"For forty-eight hours I labored at the bedside of my poor burned and bruised but uncomplaining brother...and then the star of my hope went out and left me in the gloom of despair...\\" On February 24, 1830, as the \\"Helen McGragor\\" prepared to pull away from the Memphis waterfront the starboard boiler exploded, most likely due to a failure to relieve excess pressure built up while the boat was stationary. The blast itself and flying debris killed a number of people, while about 30 others were scalded to death. On April 27, 1865, a damaged boiler on the \\"Sultana\\" exploded seven miles north of Memphis while carrying a massively overweight load of released Union army POWs. The initial blast along with the fire that immediately followed killed at least 1,192, making it the deadliest maritime disaster in U.S. history. Gambling Mississippi Riverboats being loaded on the Memphis waterfront (1906) Gambling took many forms on riverboats. Gambling with one's life with the boilers aside, there were sharks around willing to fleece the unsuspecting rube. As cities passed ordinances against gaming houses in town, the cheats moved to the unregulated waters of the Mississippi aboard river steamers. There was also gambling with the racing of boats up the river. Bets were made on a favorite vessel. Pushing the boilers hard in races would also cause fires to break out on the wooden deck structures. Regulation One of the enduring issues in American government is the proper balance of power between the national government and the state governments. This struggle for power was evident from the earliest days of American government and is the underlying issue in the case of Gibbons v. Ogden. In 1808, Robert Fulton and Robert Livingston were granted a monopoly from the New York state government to operate steamboats on the state's waters. This meant that only their steamboats could operate on the waterways of New York, including those bodies of water that stretched between states, called interstate waterways. This monopoly was very important because steamboat traffic, which carried both people and goods, was very profitable. Aaron Ogden held a Fulton-Livingston license to operate steamboats under this monopoly. He operated steamboats between New Jersey and New York. However, another man named Thomas Gibbons competed with Aaron Ogden on this same route. Gibbons did not have a Fulton-Livingston license, but instead had a federal (national) coasting license, granted under a 1793 act of Congress. The United States at this time was a loose confederation of states. The federal government was weak, and so regulating vessels, even for gaming statutes, was an imposition on States Rights. The Interstate Steamboat Commerce Commission was finally set up in 1838 to regulate steamboat traffic. Boiler inspections only began in 1852. Steamboat Act of May 30, 1852 The 1838 law proved inadequate as steamboat disasters increased in volume and severity. The 1847 to 1852 era was marked by an unusual series of disasters primarily caused by boiler explosions, however, many were also caused by fires and collisions. These disasters resulted in the passage of the Steamboat Act of May 30, 1852 (10 Stat. L., 1852) in which enforcement powers were placed under the Department of the Treasury rather than the Department of Justice as with the Act of 1838. Under this law, the organization and form of a federal maritime inspection service began to emerge. Nine supervisory inspectors were appointed, each of them responsible for a specific geographic region. There were also provisions for the appointment of local inspectors by a commission consisting of the local District Collector of Customs, the Supervisory Inspector, and the District Judge. The important features of this law were the requirement for hydrostatic testing of boilers, and the requirement for a boiler steam safety valve. This law further required that both pilots and engineers be licensed by the local inspectors. Even though time and further insight proved the Steamboat Act inadequate, it must be given credit for starting legislation in the right perspective. Probably the most serious shortcoming was the exemption of freightboats, ferries, tugboats and towboats, which continued to operate under the superficial inspection requirements of the law of 1838. Again, disasters and high loss of life prompted congressional action through the passage of the Act of February 28, 1871. Showboats Union Troops arrive at Louisville, 1862 A showboat (or show boat) was a form of theater that traveled along the waterways of the United States, especially along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. A showboat was basically a barge that resembled a long, flat-roofed house, and in order to move down the river, it was pushed by a small tugboat (misleadingly labeled a towboat) which was attached to it. It would have been impossible to put a steam engine on it, since it would have had to have been placed right in the auditorium. British- born actor William Chapman, Sr. created the first showboat, named the \\"Floating Theatre,\\" in Pittsburgh in 1831. He and his family performed plays with added music and dance at stops along the waterways. After reaching New Orleans, they got rid of the boat and went back to Pittsburgh in a steam boat in order to perform the process once again the year after. Showboats had declined by the Civil War, but began again in 1878 and focused on melodrama and vaudeville. Major boats of this period included the New Sensation, New Era, Water Queen, and the Princess. With the improvement of roads, the rise of the automobile, motion pictures, and the maturation of the river culture, showboats declined again. In order to combat this development, they grew in size and became more colorful and elaborately designed in the 20th century. These boats included the Golden Rod, the Sunny South, the Cotton Blossom, the New Showboat, and the Minnesota Centennial Showboat. Jazzmen Louis Armstrong and Bix Biederbecke played on Mississippi River steamers. In Oklahoma As the federal government removed the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Creek Nations to Oklahoma, the new immigrants and the military forces demanded supplies, creating a vigorous steamboat trade to the Mississippi River down to New Orleans or upstream to points north. At the peak of steamboat commerce, in the 1840s and 1850s, there were twenty-two landings between Fort Smith in present- day Arkansas, and Fort Gibson, with the most difficult point at Webbers Falls. Civil War Service USS Cairo The American Civil War spilled over to the Mississippi with naval sieges and naval war using paddlewheelers. The Battle of Vicksburg involved monitors and ironclad riverboats. The USS Cairo is a wrecked survivor of the Vicksburg battle. Trade on the river was suspended for two years because of a Confederate blockade. The triumph of Eads ironclads, and Farragut's seizure of New Orleans, secured the river for the Union North. The worst of all steamboat accidents occurred at the end of the Civil War in April 1865, when the steamboat Sultana, carrying an over-capacity load of returning Union soldiers recently freed from Confederate prison camp, blew up, causing more than 1,000 deaths.The exact number of casualties is unclear. Compare The Sultana on fire, from Harpers Weekly Reconstruction With the Union Victory and occupation of the south, transport was administered by the US Army and Navy. The year 1864 brought an all-time low water mark on Upper Mississippi mark for all subsequent measurements. Stern wheelers proved more adaptable than side wheelers for barges. Immediately after the war, passenger steamboats become larger, faster and floating palaces began to appear; on the freight barges salt, hay, iron ore, and grain were carried. A few boats specialized in pushing huge log rafts downstream to lumber mills. By 1850, a system of moving barges and log rafts lashed alongside and ahead of the towboat was developed which allowed greater control than towing on a hawser. This type of service favored sternwheel propelled boats over sidewheelers and promoted other improvements as well. Towboats became a distinct type by 1860. Sand and gravel for construction was dredged up from river bottoms, and pumped aboard cargo barges. Simple hydraulic dredging rigs on small barges did the work. Towboats moved the dredge and sand barges around as needed. The Great Race Steamboat Robert E. Lee, by August Norieri. Natchez VII was built in 1869. It was long, had eight boilers and a 5,500 cotton bale capacity. In its -year service, it made 401 trips without a single deadly accident. It became famous as the participant against another Mississippi paddle steamer, the Robert E. Lee, in a race from New Orleans to St. Louis in June 1870, immortalized in a lithograph by Currier and Ives. This Natchez had beaten the previous speed record, that of the J. M. White in 1844. Stripped down, carrying no cargo, steaming on through fog and making only one stop, the Robert E. Lee won the race in 3 days, 18 hours and 14 minutes. By contrast, the Natchez carried her normal load and stopped as normal, tying up overnight when fog was encountered. Despite this she berthed only six hours later. When Leathers finally dismantled the boat in Cincinnati in 1879, this particular Natchez had never flown the American flag. Competition from the railroads Railroads were rebuilt in the south after the Civil War, the disconnected small roads, of broad gauge, were amalgamated and enlarged into big systems of the southern Illinois Central and Louisville and Nashville. Track was changed to the American Standard of 4 feet 8 and one half inches. This ways cars could travel from Chicago to the south without having to be reloaded. Consequently, rail transport became cheaper than steamboats. The boats could not keep up. The first railroad bridge built across the Mississippi River connected Davenport and Rock Island, IL in 1856, built by the Rock Island Railroad. Steamboaters saw nationwide railroads as a threat to their business. On May 6, 1856, just weeks after it was completed, a pilot crashed the Effie Afton steamboat into the bridge. The owner of the Effie Afton, John Hurd, filed a lawsuit against The Rock Island Railroad Company. The Rock Island Railroad Company selected Abraham Lincoln as their trial lawyer. Rise of barge traffic Barge traffic exploded with the growth of trade from the First World War. Freight tonnage on the Upper Mississippi fell below 1 million tons per year in 1916 and hovered around 750,000 tons until 1931. A number of factors had led to this decline. Log rafts and raft towboats had disappeared and river cargo service had shifted to short-haul instead of long distance hauling. The First World War made crewmen scarce and helped to make the railroads stronger. The deficiencies of railroad transportation during World War I led to the Transportation Act of 1920. In spite of these problems, the heavy transportation needs of wartime could not be met by railroads and river transport took off some of the pressure. In 1917, the United States Shipping Board allocated $3,160,000 to the Emergency Fleet Corporation to build and operate barges and towboats on the Upper Mississippi. Federal control was augmented by the Federal Control Act of 1918. The U.S. Railroad Administration formed the Committee on Inland Waterways to oversee the work. All floating equipment on the Mississippi and Warrior River systems was commandeered and $12 million was appropriated for new construction. Service was provided primarily on the Lower Mississippi. New floating equipment was designed by prominent naval architects, and built by boat yards known for high-quality work. Modern terminal facilities were constructed to handle bulk and package freight. A special rate system was put into place to reflect the lower cost of river transportation in comparison with railroads. In spite of their innovative approach, the Railroad Administration lost money on river services and in 1920 the Federal Barge Fleet was transferred to the War Department. Lithograph of the Mississippi River Squadron running the Confederate blockade at Vicksburg on April 16, 1863. The name was changed to the Inland and Coastwise Waterways Service and the experiment continued. The Waterways Service lost less money than the Railroad Administration and in 1924 was modified yet again to allow even more economical operation in a less restrictive environment. The government transferred $5 million worth of floating equipment to provide the capital stock for the new Inland Waterways Corporation. Compression ignition or diesel engines were first used about 1910 for smaller sternwheel towboats, but did not gain ascendancy until the late 1930s, when diesel-powered propeller boats appeared. The introduction of screw propellers to the rivers came late because of their vulnerability to damage and the greater depth of water required for efficient operation. The Federal Barge Lines experiment was successful in restarting the river transportation industry. Congress created the Inland Waterways Corporation (1924) and its Federal Barge Line. The completion of the nine-foot channel of the Ohio River in 1929 was followed by similar improvements on the Mississippi and its tributaries and the Gulf Intra-Coastal Canals. Each improvement marked a giant step by the U.S. Army Engineers (Corps of Engineers) in promoting inland waterways development. Private capital followed these improvements with heavy investments in towboats and barges. In the years before World War II, towboat power soared steadily from 600 to 1,200 to 2,400. The shift from steam to diesel engines cut crews from twenty or more on steam towboats to an average of eleven to thirteen on diesels. By 1945, fully 50 percent of the towboats were diesel; by 1955, the figure was 97 percent. Meanwhile, the paddlewheel had given way to the propeller, the single propeller to the still-popular twin propeller. Traffic on the Mississippi system climbed from 211 million short tons to more than 330 million between 1963 and 1974. The growth in river shipping did not abate in the final quarter of the century. Traffic along the Upper Mississippi rose from 54 million tons in 1970 to 112 million tons in 2000. The change from riveted to welded barges, the creation of integrated barges, and the innovation of double-skinned barges have led to improved economy, speed, and safety. Shipping on Mississippi barges became substantially less expensive than railroad transport, but at a cost to taxpayers. Barge traffic is the most heavily subsidized form of transport in the United States. A report in 1999 revealed that fuel taxes cover only 10 percent of the annual $674 million that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spends building and operating the locks and dams of the Mississippi River. Barges figured there were a lot more corn and soybeans in Iowa than there was scrap iron! Until then, some had limited themselves to pushing scrap downstream and coal upriver, but those commodities were dwarfed by the potential downstream grain business. Overcoming the challenges of expansion, more players jumped into the booming barge industry. Today 60% of U.S. grain exports travel by barge down the Mississippi River system to the Gulf. The barge industry handles 15% of the nation's inter-city traffic for just 3% of the nation's freight bill. Barge transportation is the safest surface mode of transportation and is more fuel efficient than rail. A single barge carries the equivalent of 15 railcars and on the Lower Mississippi some tows handle up to 40 plus barges. Flood of 1927 The Mississippi 1927 flood began when heavy rains pounded the central basin of the Mississippi in the summer of 1926. By September, the Mississippi's tributaries in Kansas and Iowa were swollen to capacity. On New Year's Day of 1927, the Cumberland River at Nashville topped levees at . The Mississippi River broke out of its levee system in 145 places and flooded or about . The area was inundated up to a depth of . The flood caused over $400 million in damages and killed 246 people in seven states. The flood affected Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee. Arkansas was hardest hit, with 14% of its territory covered by floodwaters. By May 1927, the Mississippi River below Memphis, Tennessee, reached a width of . Mississippi River Commission Battle of Fort Hindman The Mississippi River Commission was established in 1879 to facilitate improvement of the Mississippi River from the Head of Passes near its mouth to its headwaters. The stated mission of the Commission was to: *Develop and implement plans to correct, permanently locate, and deepen the channel of the Mississippi River. *Improve and give safety and ease to the navigation thereof. *Prevent destructive floods. *Promote and facilitate commerce, trade, and the postal service. For nearly a half century the MRC functioned as an executive body reporting directly to the Secretary of War. The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 changed the mission of the MRC. The consequent Flood Control Act of 1928 created the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project (MR&T;). The act assigned responsibility for developing and implementing the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project (MR&T;) to the Mississippi River Commission. The MR&T; project provides for: *Control of floods of the Mississippi River from Head of Passes to vicinity of Cape Girardeau, Missouri. *Control of floods of the tributaries and outlets of the Mississippi River as they are affected by its backwaters. *Improvement for navigation of the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Cairo, Illinois. This includes improvements to certain harbors and improvement for navigation of Old and Atchafalaya Rivers from the Mississippi River to Morgan City, Louisiana. *Bank stabilization of the Mississippi River from the Head of Passes to Cairo, Illinois. *Preservation, restoration, and enhancement of environmental resources, including but not limited to measures for fish and wildlife, increased water supplies, recreation, cultural resources, and other related water resources development programs. *Semi-annual inspection trips to observe river conditions and facilitate coordination with local interests in implementation of the project. The President of the Mississippi River Commission is its executive head. The mission is executed through the Mississippi Valley Division, U.S. Army Engineer Districts in St. Louis, Memphis, Vicksburg, and New Orleans. US Army Corps of Engineers The United States Army Corps of Engineers is a federal agency and a major Army command made up of some 34,600 civilian and 650 military personnel, making it the world's largest public engineering, design and construction management agency. Although generally associated with dams, canals and flood protection in the United States, USACE is involved in a wide range of public works. *Navigation. Supporting navigation by maintaining and improving channels was the Corps of Engineers' earliest Civil Works mission, dating to Federal laws in 1824 authorizing the Corps to improve safety on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and several ports. Today, the Corps maintains more than of inland waterways and operates 235 locks. These waterways‚Äîa system of rivers, lakes and coastal bays improved for commercial and recreational transportation‚Äîcarry about 1/6 of the Nation's inter-city freight, at a cost per ton-mile about 1/2 that of rail or 1/10 that of trucks. USACE also maintains 300 commercial harbors, through which pass 2 billion tons of cargo a year, and more than 600 smaller harbors. *Flood Damage Reduction. The Corps was first called upon to address flood problems along the Mississippi river in the mid-19th century. They began work on the Mississippi River and Tributaries Flood Control Project in 1928, and the Flood Control Act of 1936 gave the Corps the mission to provide flood protection to the entire country. Neither the Corps nor any other agency can prevent all flood damages; and when floods cause damage, there is sure to be controversy. The Corps maintained its own fleet of river steamers, derricks, dredges and cranes, all steam powered, for many years. See Montgomery (snagboat) The Feds Step In: the Tennessee Valley Authority Project Typical modern snagboat On May 18, 1933, Congress passed the Tennessee Valley Authority Act. Right from the start, TVA established a unique problem-solving approach to fulfilling its mission-integrated resource management. Each issue TVA faced‚Äîwhether it was power production, navigation, flood control, malaria prevention, reforestation, or erosion control‚Äîwas studied in its broadest context. By the end of the war, TVA had completed a navigation channel the length of the Tennessee River and had become the nation‚Äôs largest electricity supplier. Again the TVA project needed the services of steamers to haul cement for the dams. World War II LST construction LCT being lowered into the water The Second World War put huge demands on shipping. Every floating vessel was put to work, retired or old. The Gulf Coast was turned into a huge industrial works. Shipbuilding, steel making in Alabama, forestry, and landing craft building in the Plains towns. The Prairie boats were moved down the river for re-staging in New Orleans. The Higgins boat put its mark on shipping. The need for Landing Ships, Tank (LST), was urgent in the war, and the program enjoyed a high priority throughout the war. Since most shipbuilding activities were located in coastal yards and were largely used for construction of large, deep-draft ships, new construction facilities were established along inland waterways of the Mississippi. In some instances, heavy-industry plants such as steel fabrication yards were converted for LST construction. This posed the problem of getting the completed ships from the inland building yards in the Plains to deep water. The chief obstacles were bridges. The US Navy successfully undertook the modification of bridges and, through a \\"Ferry Command\\" of Navy crews, transported the newly constructed ships to coastal ports for fitting out. The success of these \\"cornfield\\" shipyards of the Middle West was a revelation to the long-established shipbuilders on the coasts. Their contribution to the LST building program was enormous. Of the 1,051 LSTs built during World War II, 670 were constructed by five major inland builders. The most LSTs constructed during WWII were built in Evansville, Indiana, by Missouri Valley Bridge and the International Iron & Steel Co. The end of steamboats The Str. Natchez in New Orleans The Great Depression, the explosion of shipbuilding capability on the river because of the war, and the rise of diesel tugboats finished the steamboat era. Boats were tied up as they had time expired, being built in the First World War or 1920s. Lower crew requirements of diesel tugs made continued operation of steam towboats uneconomical during the late 1940s. The wage increases caused by inflation after the war, and the availability of war surplus tugs and barges, put the older technology at a disadvantage. Some steam-powered, screw- propeller towboats were built but they were either later converted to diesel- power or retired. A few diesel sternwheelers stayed on the rivers after steam sternwheelers disappeared. Jack Kerouac noted in On the Road seeing many derelict steamers on the River at this time. Many steam vessels were broken up. Steam derricks and snagboats continued to be used until the 1960s and a few survivors soldiered on. The Str. American Queen in Dubuque, Iowa Today, few paddlewheelers continue to run on steam power. Those that do include the Belle of Louisville, Natchez, Minne-Ha-Ha, Chautauqua Belle, Julia Belle Swain, and American Queen. Other vessels propelled by sternwheels exist, but do not employ the use of steam engines. Overnight passage on steamboats in the United States ended in 2008. The Delta Queen could resume that service, but it requires the permission of the United States Congress. The American Queen was in the US Ready Reserve fleet and was purchased and relaunched in April 2012 and now carries passengers on 4 to 10 night voyages on the Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers as the flagship of the American Queen Steamboat Company. On October 18, 2014, the Belle of Louisville became the first Mississippi River-style steamboat to reach 100 years old. To celebrate the unprecedented achievement there was a five-day festival in Louisville, KY called Belle's Big Birthday Bash. Current Natchez The ninth and current Natchez, the Str. Natchez, is a sternwheel steamboat based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Built in 1975, she is sometimes referred to as the Natchez IX. She is operated by the New Orleans Steamboat Company and docks at the Toulouse Street Wharf. Day trips include harbor and dinner cruises along the Mississippi River. It is modeled not after the original Natchez, but instead by the steamboats Hudson and Virginia. Its steam engines were originally built in 1925 for the steamboat Clairton, from which the steering system and paddlewheel shaft also came. From the S.S. J.D. Ayres came its copper bell, made of 250 melted silver dollars. The bell has on top a copper acorn that was once on the Avalon, now known as the Belle of Louisville, and on the Delta Queen. It also features a steam calliope, made by the Frisbee Engine Company, that has 32 notes. The wheel is made of white oak and steel, is by , and weighs 26 tons.[2] The whistle came from a ship that sank in 1908 on the Monagabola River. It was launched from Braithwaite, Louisiana. It is long and wide. It has a draft of six feet and weighs 1384 tons. It is mostly made of steel, due to United States Coast Guard rules.[3] In 1982 the Natchez won the Great Steamboat Race, which is held every year on the Wednesday immediately before the first Saturday in May, as part of the Kentucky Derby Festival held in Louisville, Kentucky.[4] It has partaken in other races, and has never lost.[5] Those it has beaten include the Belle of Louisville, the Delta Queen, the Belle of Cincinnati, the American Queen, and the Mississippi Queen.

This was the location of the temporary Banbury Road terminus, which was used until the facilities at Oxford were ready.Mitchell & Smith, fig.

Two of these halts (including Oxford Road Halt) were opened on 9 October 1905; all three closed on 1 January 1917, reopened 5 May 1919 and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway finally closed them on 25 October 1926.Mitchell & Smith, figs. 24,27,28Waters, p.128Simpson, p.107 In 1935 the Oxford Road level crossing was replaced by a bridge to the north- east, which crosses the railway over the site of the former halt.Mitchell & Smith, figs.

NAMFREL's goal is to ensure \\"free, orderly and honest elections\\" in the Philippines. It is a non-partisan organization with over 250,000 member-volunteers from different religious, civic, business, professional, labor, youth, educational, and non-government organizations. The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has accredited NAMFREL as its \\"citizens' arm\\" since 1986 to conduct manual parallel counts, which it called \\"Operation Quick Count.\\" In 1986, NAMFREL mobilized 500,000 volunteers nationwide to guard the snap presidential elections. President Ferdinand Marcos declared himself the winner of the election; the NAMFREL count, however, showed that Corazon Aquino won. In the days that followed, the EDSA People Power revolt took place, sweeping Aquino to power. For the May 2010 automated Philippine presidential elections NAMFREL was not accredited to conduct its own count. Instead, the organization conducted a nationwide election observation mission called \\"Bantay ng Bayan\\" (\\"sentinels of the people\\"). Presently, NAMFREL is also active internationally, its officers and volunteers having worked as trainers, observer team members, election administrators and resource persons in 35 countries, and have sent its volunteers as the official Philippine observer delegation to Cambodia during the 1998 parliamentary elections there, as well as in Indonesia in 1999 for the Presidential elections after the fall of Suharto.http://www.namfrel.com.ph/v2/aboutus/history.php In 1998, NAMFREL representatives attended the International IDEA conference in Copenhagen.

He was also the chairman of the IUPAP Cosmic Ray Commission. Biography and scientific career Aleksandr Chudakov was born on 16 June 1921, and graduated from Moscow State University (MSU) in 1948 . In 1953 his experimental confirmation of the existence of the transition radiation, which was predicted by Ginzburg and Ilya Frank in 1945, and the effect of decreasing ionization losses for narrow electron-positron pairs, known as the Chudakov Effect, are among Chudakov's famous works. Phenomena similar to Chudakov Effect have been observed in quantum chromodynamics also. Chudakov was the author of series of experiments carried out in the 1950s, which focused on investigation of the cosmic rays outside of the atmosphere with rockets and first satellites. As a result, during the third Soviet sputnik, he discovered the Earth's radiation belts in collaboration with S. N. Vernov. In 1961 Chudakov and G. T. Zatsepin suggested the air Chernkov method for the gamma-ray astronomy and carried out a pioneering experiment at Katsively, Crimea. From the mid-1960s Chudakov headed the design and construction of the Baksan Underground Scintillation Telescope, which was put into operation in 1978 and considered to be one of the first large multipurpose facilities for underground physics.

History  In Los Infantes captain Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado had discovered that the rebels had constructed a pukara close by, establishing a blockade of the city. Lorenzo Bernal ordered a reconnaissance patrol and he observed that the natives under the toqui Illanguli√©n had chosen an impregnable position in a marsh and chose to retire. Illanguli√©n's troops then moved to a second position, nearer to Angol, to which captain Lorenzo Bernal responded with a new reconnaissance. Finding that this new position also was impregnable he again retired. Feeling victorious and believing the destruction of Angol was imminent, a Mapuche detachment located themselves in a third position awaiting reinforcements from their main body at the old position. This time, seeing their dangerous proximity to Los Infantes, captain Bernal chose to attack the position before more Mapuches arrived. In the battle the Spanish drove the Mapuche out of their pukara and pursued them down to the river bank and drove them into the river, where they were trapped and 1,000 Mapuches were killed, including the toqui Illanguel√©n, and many more were wounded or captured. Bernal ordered some of the captives killed and others lost hands or feet. When the news reached the rest of the Mapuche army coming to attack Angol, they dispersed.

He is best known as the creator and subsequent Design and Art Director of Br√∏derbund's Living Books series, one of the first lines of children's interactive book software on CD-ROM. Schlichting was Design and Art Director for Living Book's first interactive CD-ROM book adaptation, Mercer Mayer‚Äôs Just Grandma and Me, which was one of the first software titles accredited as a school textbook and used as a product demonstration by Apple CEO John Sculley. Br√∏derbund‚Äôs Living Books Schlichting began working at Br√∏derbund as a freelance animator, where he suggested his idea of creating interactive software based on existing children‚Äôs books with each illustrated page of the digital version of the book filled with clickable, interactive \\"hot spots\\". He soon became head of the team of the new division called Living Books, where they first began adapting Mercer Mayer‚Äôs Just Grandma and Me and Marc Brown‚Äôs Arthur‚Äôs Teacher Trouble into interactive children‚Äôs software. The software imitated the real-life experience of reading these books but with enhanced computer features and the ability to read them in multiple languages. These interactive animated digital children's books were the first of their kind and included the option of a ‚Äúread-through‚Äù, where the user could digitally turn the illustrated ‚Äúpages‚Äù and hear a narrator read the text, and the ‚Äúinteractive‚Äù version, where users could click around on each page to find and activate dozens of animated sequences, often accompanied by music, sound effects, or dialogue. NoodleWorks Interactive In 2000 Schlichting founded NoodleWorks Interactive, which specializes in children's interactive design, development, and design consulting. Under Schlighting's supervision, NoodleWorks Interactive has worked with children's learning and entertainment companies and projects such as LeapFrog, eScore - Learning Centers, Pearson Broadband (Educational Division, London), Fisher/Price, Snicker Interactive Toys, Serosity, Electronic Arts (EA), LBS Alchemy, and more. In November 2011, Schlichting released Noodle Words, an iPad app for children where they may choose a word from a box and tap it to see animated bee characters act out the word's meaning. Noodle Words received the Kids At Play Interactive, or KAPi, Award for Best Educational Product of The Year, the Parent's Choice Gold Award, a KAPi Pioneer Legend Award for Schlichting, and the Children's Technology Review Editor's Choice Award, among others. Wanderful Apps In 2012, Schlichting was Chief Creative Officer of the Wanderful interactive storybooks, where he worked with his former Br√∏derbund and Living Books colleague Mickey W. Mantle to adapt several of his Living Books CD-ROM titles into apps for touchscreen devices. Wanderful released app versions of the Living Books titles The Tortoise and the Hare, Arthur's Teacher Trouble, Little Monster at School, Ruff's Bone, and Schlichting's own children's book Harry and the Haunted House. Book and Software Authorship Schlichting is the author and illustrator of Harry and the Haunted House, which he has released in various forms- as a children's book, a Living Books interactive CD-ROM, and, in 2012, an app from Wanderful interactive storybooks. For the iOS app, Schlichting worked with Wanderful in adapting the original Living Books CD-ROM to take advantage of the new touch-screen format, so that \\"virtually everything\\" on a page that looked \\"tappable\\" could be tapped to \\"come to life\\" and activate an animation, sound, or other interactive element, including tapping on the individual words of the text. The Wanderful book app can be in either English or Spanish, and can be purchased to include French as well. Schlichting released a new nonfiction book in October 2016 on the psychology and art form of interactivity, titled Understanding Kids, Play, and Interactive Design: How to Create Games Children Love.

Partial regression plots are also referred to as added variable plots, adjusted variable plots, and individual coefficient plots. When performing a linear regression with a single independent variable, a scatter plot of the response variable against the independent variable provides a good indication of the nature of the relationship. If there is more than one independent variable, things become more complicated. Although it can still be useful to generate scatter plots of the response variable against each of the independent variables, this does not take into account the effect of the other independent variables in the model. Calculation Partial regression plots are formed by: #Computing the residuals of regressing the response variable against the independent variables but omitting Xi #Computing the residuals from regressing Xi against the remaining independent variables #Plotting the residuals from (1) against the residuals from (2). Velleman and Welsch express this mathematically as: : Y_{\\\\bullet[i]}\\\\mathrm{\\\\ versus\\\\ }X_{i\\\\bullet[i]} where :Y‚Ä¢[i] = residuals from regressing Y (the response variable) against all the independent variables except Xi :Xi‚Ä¢[i] = residuals from regressing Xi against the remaining independent variables. Properties Velleman and Welsch list the following useful properties for this plot: #The least squares linear fit to this plot has the slope \\\\beta_{i} and intercept zero. #The residuals from the least squares linear fit to this plot are identical to the residuals from the least squares fit of the original model (Y against all the independent variables including Xi). #The influences of individual data values on the estimation of a coefficient are easy to see in this plot. #It is easy to see many kinds of failures of the model or violations of the underlying assumptions (nonlinearity, heteroscedasticity, unusual patterns). . Partial regression plots are related to, but distinct from, partial residual plots. Partial regression plots are most commonly used to identify data points with high leverage and influential data points that might not have high leverage. Partial residual plots are most commonly used to identify the nature of the relationship between Y and Xi (given the effect of the other independent variables in the model). Note that since the simple correlation between the two sets of residuals plotted is equal to the partial correlation between the response variable and Xi, partial regression plots will show the correct strength of the linear relationship between the response variable and Xi. This is not true for partial residual plots. On the other hand, for the partial regression plot, the x-axis is not Xi. This limits its usefulness in determining the need for a transformation (which is the primary purpose of the partial residual plot).

Interpreting these metrics meaningfully requires context, and this context is frequently implicit and depends on the field and the problem under consideration. This article describes a number of important pieces of context and how they affect metrics.  Definitions of variables  Metrics are usually described in terms of variables that are a function of the input. For example, the statement that insertion sort requires O(n2) comparisons is meaningless without defining n, which in this case is the number of elements in the input list. Because many different contexts use the same letters for their variables, confusion can arise. For example, the complexity of primality tests and multiplication algorithms can be measured in two different ways: one in terms of the integers being tested or multiplied, and one in terms of the number of binary digits (bits) in those integers. For example, if n is the integer being tested for primality, trial division can test it in Œò(n1/2) arithmetic operations; but if n is the number of bits in the integer being tested for primality, it requires Œò(2n/2) time. In the fields of cryptography and computational number theory, it is more typical to define the variable as the number of bits in the input integers. In the field of computational complexity theory, the input is usually specified as a binary string (or a string in some fixed alphabet), and the variable is usually the number of bits in this string. This measure depends on the specific encoding of the input, which must be specified. For example, if the input is an integer specified using unary coding, trial division will require only Œò(n1/2) arithmetic operations; but if the same input is specified in binary (or any larger base) the complexity rises to Œò(2n/2) operations, not because the algorithm is taking any additional time, but because the number of bits in the input n has become exponentially smaller. In the other direction, succinct circuits are compact representations of a limited class of graphs that occupy exponentially less space than ordinary representations like adjacency lists. Many graph algorithms on succinct circuits are EXPTIME-complete, whereas the same problems expressed with conventional representations are only P-complete, because the succinct circuit inputs have smaller encodings. Output-sensitive algorithms define their complexity not only in terms of their input but also their output. For example, Chan's algorithm can compute the convex hull of a set of points in O(n log h) time, where n is the number of points in the input and h is the number of points in the resulting convex hull, a subset of the input points. Because every input point might be in the convex hull, an analysis in terms of the input alone would yield the less precise O(n log n) time. The complexity of some algorithms depends not only on parameters of the input but also parameters of the machine the algorithm is being run on; as mentioned in #Metric being measured below, this is typical in analyzing algorithms that run on systems with fixed cache hierarchies, where the complexity may depend on parameters such as cache size and block size.  Abstract machine  To analyze an algorithm precisely, one must assume it is being executed by a particular abstract machine. For example, on a random access machine, binary search can be used to rapidly locate a particular value in a sorted list in only O(log n) comparisons, where n is the number of elements in the list; on a Turing machine, this is not possible, since it can only move one memory cell at a time and so requires Œ©(n) steps to even reach an arbitrary value in the list. Moreover, different abstract machines define different primitive operations, which are operations that can be performed in constant time. Some machines, like Turing machines, only permit one bit at a time to be read or written; these are called bit operations, and the number of bit operations required to solve a problem is called its bit complexity. Bit complexity generalizes to any machine where the memory cells are of a fixed size that does not depend on the input; for this reason, algorithms that manipulate numbers much larger than the registers on ordinary PCs are typically analyzed in terms of their bit complexity. Put another way, the bit complexity is the complexity when the word size is a single bit, where word size is the size of each memory cell and register. Another commonly used model has words with log n bits, where n is a variable depending on the input. For example, in graph algorithms, it is typical to assume that the vertices are numbered 1 through n and that each memory cell can hold any of these values, so that they can refer to any vertex. This is justified in problems where the input uses Œ©(n) words of storage, since on real computers, the memory cell and register size is typically selected in order to be able to index any word in memory. Operations on these words, such as copies and arithmetic operations, are assumed to operate in constant time, rather than O(log n) time. The number of word operations required to solve a problem in this model is sometimes called its word complexity. In computational complexity theory, researchers intentionally define complexity classes in a way intended to make them machine-independent - that is, if a problem lies in a particular class relative to a particular \\"reasonable\\" machine, it will lie in that class relative to any \\"reasonable\\" machine. For example, as mentioned above, the time complexity of binary search depends on whether a Turing machine or a random access machine is used; but regardless of the machine choice, it lies in P, the class of polynomial-time algorithms. In general, P is considered a machine-independent class because any operation that can be simulated in polynomial time can be assumed to require constant time, since it can be treated as a subroutine without exceeding the polynomial-time bound. Oracle machines are machines that have a specific operation that they can perform in constant time; this operation can be arbitrarily complex and can dramatically affect the complexity of algorithms performed on the machine. For example, if one has an oracle to solve any NP-complete problem, then any problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time (whereas without the oracle, no polynomial-time algorithm is known for many of these problems). Oracle machines are impractical to construct but useful in theory for determining which proof techniques will be effective.  Metric being measured  It's typical to say without qualification that insertion sort requires O(n2) time; however, it doesn't make sense to say that the bit complexity of insertion sort is O(n2), unless the elements being sorted are of constant size. If the elements are assumed to be integers between 1 and n, then the word complexity where words have log n bits would be O(n2), but it's preferable to have a model that allows sorting of lists other than lists of small integers, such as lists of strings. In this case, instead of measuring the number of time steps the abstract machine takes, it's preferable to define a particular metric appropriate to the problem at hand. For comparison sort algorithms, which examine the input using only comparisons and modify it using only exchanges (swaps), the typical metric is either the number of element comparisons performed, the number of element exchanges performed, or the sum of these. Different comparison sort algorithms can be compared using these metrics, but for useful comparison with non-comparison sorting algorithms, such as radix sort, a different metric must be used, and the set of elements must be restricted. Because disk operations are orders of magnitude slower than accesses to main memory, the typical metric used in disk-based algorithms is the number of disk seeks or the number of blocks read from the disk, which depend on both the input and the parameters of the disk. RAM accesses and CPU operations are \\"free.\\" Similarly, in many models used to study data structures, such as the cache-oblivious model, operations on cached data are considered \\"free\\" because they are typically orders of magnitude faster in practice than access to main memory. Consequently, the typical metric used is the number of cache misses, which depends on both the input and parameters of the cache.

Since the foundation of the Club in 1954, Longford Slashers were without a home of their own and depended on the goodwill of Longford County Board to play many of their games in Pearse Park. They also rented some fields locally at other times over the years. In 1978 they purchased an initial at Farneyhoogan on the outskirts of Longford town. Following extensive development work, the first two pitches were opened on 8 June 1980 - the first competitive game was a Leader Cup match V Ardagh. The Club grounds, Clubhouse and other facilities were officially opened by the then President of Cumann Luthchleas Gael, Padraic McFlynn, on the 12 October 1980. On 25 April 2005 another milestone was reached when a new floodlit all- weather playing pitch was opened on an additional of land that the club purchased. On 6 October 2013, Slashers won their 16th county title, defeating Dromard by 1-11 to 1-9, and are now the most successful Gaelic football team in County Longford. Additional Longford Slashers are based in Michael Fay Park, Longford Town, Co. Longford. They have won the Longford Senior Football County Championship 16 times (more than any other team in Longford) They also are home to the Backstage Theatre Longford, a clubhouse and a gael scoil. They are currently the only club in the county fielding teams at football, ladies football, hurling and cam√≥gie. Adult Teams The senior football manager is Noel O'Brien, former St. Brigid's team manager. Slashers also have a Junior team, a Hurling team and a Ladies team.

Under-Age There are 8 under-age football teams in the club: u-8s, u-10s, u-12s, two u-14s, two u16s & minor, and they have enjoyed great success. Longford Slashers have enjoyed success at U-21 level in the county, with their most recent success coming in 2004.

Notable players Dessie Barry is Slashers most well known and arguably greatest player. Barry won his first county championship in 1979 at the age of 17. He went on to win five more senior championships in 1980, '89, '90, '91 and '94 receiving man-of-the- match for each of the three in a row (1989 - '91). Although he was an exceptional footballer for most of his career, playing for Longford County from 1982 to 2000, it was the period around 1990 where he was at the peak of his powers. As well as his success at the local level he was selected on successive Railway Cup teams between 1988 and 1990 and was nominated for an All-Star in those same three years. His highest national achievement came when he was picked to represent his country in the International Rules series against Australia in 1985. He is one of only three Longford players to have done so. He retired from senior football in 2001 and soon after became manager of Slashers senior team. He left the role in 2006 having helped lay the foundation for the team's success later in the decade. Dessie Barry was pick for Longford County's team of the Millennium. Barry was also nominated as one of Leinster's best footballers in the 25 year period 1984-2009.

They live primarily in and around the Khorezm Oasis. History The Choudor are thought to belong to the original Turkmen group and the left flank of Oghuz Khan‚Äôs army. They lived by the Caspian Sea since approximately the beginning of the second millennium. Abul Ghazi tells us they arrived in Mangyshlak as early as the 11th century. Prior to the rise of Toghrul Bek (the first Seljuk ruler, 1038 until 1063), many tribes followed the lead of their tribal leaders Kilik bek, Kazan bek and Karaman bek and settled in Mangyshlak. Most of them were members of the Imir, Dukur, D√ºker (D√∂ger), Igdir, Chavuldur, Karkin, Salor or Agar (Ajar) tribes. In 1219, the Mongols crushed the Khwarazm Shah and his Turkmen/Azeri allies. Two years later, in 1221, the Mongol conquest pushed the Oghuz tribes including the Choudur from the Syr Dara region into the Kara Kum area and along the Caspian Sea. Many Choudur appear to have stayed on the Mangyshlak Peninsula from then through the Timurid and the Shaybanid Uzbek periods, beginning the Turco-Mongol transformation of these originally Oghuz people. In the early 16th century, the Choudur were a confederate or aymaq in the Salar Sayin Khani confederation. The Choudur were primarily concentrated in the Mangyshlak Peninsula on the northeastern Caspian coast. The Kalmuks moved into the Mangyshlak Peninsula, the Sayin Khan confederation broke up and the Choudur ended up southeast of Khiva loosely confederated, but under the authority of the Yomud. There are indications that some Choudur ended up in the mid Amu Darya region near north of Charjui. Under the Khiva Khanate during the nineteenth century, Choudur included the Igdir, Bozachi, Abdal, and Arabachi tribes. In 1743, the Yomud captured Khiva briefly and again in 1767, but that time they held it for three years. In 1770, the Muhammad Amin Inaq of the Qungrats, defeated the Yomuds and founded the Qungrat dynasty. Part and parcel of this was the breakup of the Yomud which gave the Choudur autonomy from the Yomud, but still under the Khiva/Khwarezem Khans. Lifestyle Turkmen living in the Murgab River delta (Margiana oasis) traditionally farmed and herded karakul and fat-tailed sheep with some goats. Camels were herded separately. Herders (chovdur in Turkmen) covered an area around the oasis to the north. Each chovdur knew the wells, the temporary summer camps (yazlag) and the winter houses or camps (gyshlag) which were grouped in villages in the oasis. The gyshlags were all located in the cultivated areas, where herders could find late forage and reeds for shelters. The Choudur tribe, particularly those members who settled in Khorezm oasis' Kalinin district also speak the Choudur dialect. It is considered one of the major dialects spoken in modern Turkmenistan along with Arsari, Goklen, Teke, Salir, Sarik, and Yomud. ReferencesSources *Wixman.

It is computed as: : \\\\left(\\\\mathrm{PL}_j\\\\right)_i = \\\\frac{\\\\left(X_{j\\\\bullet[j]}\\\\right)_i^2}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^n\\\\left(X_{j\\\\bullet[j]}\\\\right)_k^2} where :j = index of independent variable :i = index of observation :Xj*[j] = residuals from regressing Xj against the remaining independent variables Note that the partial leverage is the leverage of the ith point in the partial regression plot for the jth variable. Data points with large partial leverage for an independent variable can exert undue influence on the selection of that variable in automatic regression model building procedures. In statistics, high-leverage points are those that are outliers with respect to the independent variables. In other words, high-leverage points have no neighbouring points in \\\\mathbb{R}^{p} space, where p is the number of independent variables in a regression model. This makes the fitted model likely to pass close to a high leverage observation. Hence high-leverage points have the potential to cause large changes in the parameter estimates when they are deleted‚Äîi.e., to be influential points. Although an influential point will typically have high leverage, a high leverage point is not necessarily an influential point. The leverage is typically defined as the diagonal of the hat matrix, which is : H = X(X'X)^{-1}X'. \\\\, See also * Partial residual plot * Partial regression plot * Variance inflation factor for a multi-linear fit References  External links * Partial Leverage Plot, Dataplot manual, Statistical Engineering Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology Regression diagnostics ","title":"Partial leverage"},{"id":"18597439","text":"Sunset Grill may refer to: *\\"Sunset Grill\\" (song), a song by Don Henley, first released on his 1984 album Building the Perfect Beast *Sunset Grill (film), a 1993 film starring Peter Weller, Lori Singer, and Stacy Keach *Sunset Grill (restaurant), a restaurant in West Hollywood, California *Sunset Grill (Canadian restaurant chain), a restaurant chain throughout the province of Ontario See also * Sunset Bar and Grill * Sunset (disambiguation) ","title":"Sunset Grill"},{"id":"18597440","text":"Several Canadian naval units have been named HMCS Columbia. * (I) was a that was originally commissioned as until transfer to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1940 by way of the Royal Navy. * (II) was a that served in the RCN and Canadian Forces from 1959-1974.

John was born about 1450 to Lionel de Welles, 6th Baron Welles and Margaret Beauchamp. He was a maternal half-brother of Margaret Beaufort, and thus an uncle of the half-blood of Henry VII. John died and was buried in February 1498 in Westminster, England. War of the Roses John's father, Lionel de Welles, 6th Baron Welles, was slain at the Battle of Towton in 1461, and his elder half-brother, Richard Welles, 7th Baron Welles, inherited the Welles barony. Richard Welles and his son and heir, Robert Welles, 8th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, were both beheaded in March 1470 for involvement in an uprising against Edward IV in Lincolnshire. After the death of Robert Welles, the Welles barony was inherited, in her own right, by his only sister, Joan Welles. However shortly after Joan Welles' death in about 1474/5, both her father, Richard Welles, and her brother, Robert Welles, were attainted by Act of Parliament, five years after their executions. As a result of the attainders, John Welles was not able to enjoy the title to the Welles barony until the attainders were reversed by Parliament under Henry VII. A pardon in 1478 did not prevent Welles from participating in Buckingham's rebellion. He escaped to his nephew, the future Henry VII, in Brittany after its collapse. Henry knighted him on 7 August 1485 and he was created Viscount sometime between 15 July and 25 November 1486CPR 1485-1494, pg. 491 and given substantial grants. Marriage Some time in December 1487 John married Princess Cecily of York, the daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville, making him a member of the Royal Family. Princess Cecily of York was born on 20 March 1469 in Westminster, England and died on 24 August 1507 either on the Isle of Wight or at Hatfield. The apparent aim of Henry VII was to reward his uncle for loyalty and keep Cecily from marrying a more ambitious man. John and Cecily had three children,Robert Welles (1484-1558) Elizabeth Welles (c. 1489‚Äì1498) and Anne Welles (c. 1491‚Äìc.1499). He died 9 February 1498 in London. Anne died soon after.

The association was founded on 18 April 1958, and it campaigns for the preservation, restoration and good management of the tidal and inland waterways in East Anglia. One of its early projects was an investigation into the complex legal status of the staithes or landing stages on the Norfolk Broads, which was carried out in the 1960s.

Set in a futuristic dystopia, a nuclear holocaust creates mutants who inhabit the radioactive areas. One man emerges as the leader of a group of survivors called \\"Muties\\". The main character, portrayed by Dack Rambo, is looking for zirconium which is used to make bombs to prevent aliens from destroying Earth. This B list film is notable for its excessive use of stock footage and its poor quality. Some footage comes from other New Horizons films such as Lords of the Deep, Crime Zone, Battletruck, Battle Beyond the Stars, Wheels of Fire and Dune Warriors. In fact, even a sex scene comes from stock footage, as the character in the scene has long, blond hair, while Dack Rambo's hair is dark and short. The Concorde theatrical release was filmed in Peru and was later cut up for the VHS release. Plot A failed space based defense system kills millions in a nuclear disaster. In the subsequent chaos, the wealthy developed cities run by brutal military fascists, while the poor roam the radioactive deserts created by the nuclear fallout. Many turn to extreme violence and slavery to survive. The weaker mutated victims of these violent bandits are called Muties. In 2058 Kansas City, Rudolph Kenner is staying at a casino/strip bar when he receives a message notifying him that a zirconium mine on Mars was lost to rebel forces. He is ordered to complete his mission and to take care of his trainee, Phil, the son of a zirconium business leader. The next morning, Kenner, Phil, and Phil's girlfriend Sheila, head east to Oblivion, a desolate area once known as the Atlantic seaboard. Kenner finds a young Mutie stuck in a trap and returns her to her colony. While he is there bandits attack the colony, killing Phil and capturing Kenner and Sheila. Kenner is taken to a bandit base, the Colosseum. He is brought before Bishop, the leader of the bandits, who knows Kenner's mission and plans to kill him during a gladiator battle. Fortunately, Kenner escapes from the base with a group of Muties in a bandits‚Äô car. Later, Kenner explains to Grace, one of the Muties, about his mission. He is to take radioactivity readings to see if they can zirconium around Oblivion. The precious mineral is important in fighting aliens from a parallel universe who transforms planets into stars. To thwart them, scientists developed a zirconium bomb which was used to destroy an alien starship. Kenner's mission is to find more zirconium. When Kenner asks about Grace's family, she explains her parents were eaten by subterranean, cannibalistic mutants called ‚ÄúWhities‚Äù. Eventually, Kenner and the Muties make their way back to camp, which is soon attacked by bandits. However, Kenner sits in the open and draws the bandits into the Mutie shelter. Meanwhile, the Muties hijack the bandits‚Äô vehicles and Kenner escapes. The Muties demolish their shelter, crushing the bandits inside. They capture Elijah, a stranger who was helping the bandits and who Kenner encountered earlier. The Mutie spiritual leader, Uncle Lazarus, puts Kenner in charge and reveals that he is part of an unfolding prophecy. Later, Uncle Lazarus kills himself. Initially, Kenner is reluctant about his new role but soon adapts to it. The Bishop calls the bandit patrol over on one of the vehicles' radio and Kenner answers back, pretending to be a bandit. He then decides to take the hijacked convoy to the Colosseum disguised as a patrol. Later, Kenner and Grace talk about the world Kenner comes from and the two make love. The band of Muties arrive at the Colosseum, but Elijah runs screaming out of the convoy and is shot. A firefight erupts between the Muties and the bandits. Kenner finds Sheila along with other prisoners, and then searches for the Bishop. Kenner and the Muties are ambushed by the bandits. They finally corner Bishop and discover he is actually a Mutie himself. During this confrontation, the Bishop escapes. In the end, Kenner writes back to his employers stating the conditions in Oblivion are too radioactive to mine, so they would have to buy the zirconium from the resident Muties. Grace tells Kenner she does not feel at home in the city, and Kenner agrees. The film ends with them driving back into Oblivion.

During space flight, a craft's attitude must be controlled for reasons dependent upon the craft's mission. Keeping a spacecraft slewed properly is vital toward ensuring that its high- gain antenna remains oriented toward Earth for sending and receiving data and commands. Additionally with many craft, keeping their solar arrays angled toward the Sun optimizes their power absorption and reduces the craft's reliance on internal power systems. Thermal heating and cooling of a craft and its subsystems can also be controlled by the craft's orientation. Cameras or other sensing equipment that are fixed into position upon the craft need to be aimed by slewing the craft. A spacecraft can either be spin stabilized or 3-axis stabilized to maintain proper orientation. For spin-stabilized spacecraft, slewing is accomplished by applying a (significant) torque to the spacecraft, in general by operating a thruster in synchronous or asynchronous direction to its spin to adjust its spin rate. This results in a precession and slews for this kind of spacecraft are therefore also called \\"precession manoeuvre.\\" The slew of 3-axis stabilized spacecraft is typically in closed loop control with thrusters or electrically-powered reaction wheels maintaining or altering the craft's attitude based on sensor measurements. A typical example is a space telescope that should be turned to observe a new celestial object. But also for 3-axis stabilized spacecraft for which the normal attitude is not inertially fixed the spacecraft is said to make a slew if the attitude is changed in another way and with another, mostly higher, rate than when in the basic attitude control mode. An example is the Magellan probe that once per orbit interrupted the scanning of the Venus surface making a large turn to direct its high gain antenna to the Earth for data transmission.

Radio and media  After a chance encounter with a radio program director at a function in Hobart in early 2007, Argenti was offered the host position of the drive show on Heart 107.3 in Hobart, Tasmania. The following day, Argenti debuted on radio and remained in that position until January 2009, when he moved to Melbourne to join Crocmedia as host of All Night Appetite on sports talk radio station 1116 SEN.New Host Joins SEN's All Night Appetite , Crocmedia Newsletter, March 2009. Argenti remains a regular commentator and analyst on the station, generally covering football (soccer) and mixed martial arts. In February 2010, Argenti was poached by Southern Cross Austereo to host the networked talkback show Talking Back the Night, broadcasting to 35 stations nationally on the broadcaster's LocalWorks network. In 2010 and 2011, he also hosted the national drive sports radio show 'The Home Straight' with former AFL player Peter 'Spida' Everitt and former NRL player Scott Sattler on the network across Australia. The radio industry's governing body in Australia acknowledged Argenti's work when it announced him as a finalist in the category of 'Best Talk Presenter' for the Australian Commercial Radio Awards (ACRAS) in 2011 and again in 2012 alongside veterans Neil Mitchell, Ray Hadley, Paul Murray and John Stanley. Argenti and his radio show can be heard in every state and throughout a significant portion of regional & provincial Australia each weeknight. Argenti has become well known and at times criticised for his opinionated style and the heavy criticism he regularly broadcasts targeting federal politicians & the federal government often referring to them as 'those clowns' or 'buffoons in Canberra'. In 2012, Argenti has strengthened a personal 'campaign' against political correctness in Australian society in 2012 and what he calls the 'erosion of free speech and plain speaking in this country', which are two of the more noticeable cornerstones of the show.

Based in Wilmington, Delaware, it operated from 1848 to 1959. Shipbuilding was the primary focus from 1853 until the end of World War II, when the company converted the shipyard to production of machinery for paper manufacturing. The yard built more than 500 ships, from large cargo vessels to small warships and yachts, including ‚ÄúVolunteer‚Äù, the winner of the 1887 America‚Äôs Cup. History The company began in 1848, when Joshua L. Pusey and John Jones formed a partnership in Wilmington, Delaware, to run a machine shop in space rented from a whaling company. The shipyard sat between the Christina River and the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1851, Edward Betts and Joshua Seal, who were operating an iron foundry in Wilmington, purchased an interest in the business, and the name of the company became Betts, Pusey, Jones & Seal. In 1854, Pusey and Jones built the first U.S. iron-hulled sailing vessel, the schooner \\"Mahlon Betts\\". At the beginning of the Civil War the company began building vessels for the U.S. military. The first was a sloop of war, which required immediate expansion of the workforce. The company also built engines and boilers for other shipbuilding firms. In 1887, the company built the first steel-hulled yacht to win the America‚Äôs Cup, \\"Volunteer\\". During World War I, the firm grew to more than 2,000 employees. A second shipyard was added in Gloucester City, New Jersey, which was initially called Pennsylvania Shipbuilding Company but was soon changed to Pusey & Jones. After producing 19 ships, the name was changed to New Jersey Shipbuilding Company. The yard was closed after the war. After the business slump of the early 1920s, the company reorganized in 1927 under businessman Clement C. Smith, becoming Pusey and Jones Corporation. The company focused on building large luxury steam and motor yachts for wealthy patrons. As World War II approached, military orders increased. The highest employment was reached during World War II, when more than 3,600 employees worked in the shipyards, plants and offices of the company. Pusey and Jones built 19 Type C1 ships for the U.S. Maritime Commission. Other craft such as minesweepers were built, along with specialty and smaller vessels. Many commercial and private vessels originally built by the company were also converted to military use. On Liberty Fleet Day -- September 27, 1941 -- the yard launched one of the first Liberty ships, SS Adabelle Lykes. After World War II, Pusey and Jones converted the shipyard's facilities to manufacture papermaking machinery. The company closed in 1959.

It can be either chronic or acute and may vary widely in severity. A chronic sleep-restricted state adversely affects the brain and cognitive function. However, in a subset of cases, sleep deprivation can, paradoxically, lead to increased energy and alertness and enhanced mood; although its long-term consequences have never been evaluated, it has even been used as a treatment for depression. Few studies have compared the effects of acute total sleep deprivation and chronic partial sleep restriction. Complete absence of sleep over long periods is not frequent in humans (unless they suffer from fatal familial insomnia or specific issues caused by surgery); it appears that brief microsleeps cannot be avoided. Long- term total sleep deprivation has caused death in lab animals. Physiological effects Main health effects of sleep deprivation.

In 2005, a study of over 1400 participants showed that participants who habitually slept few hours were more likely to have associations with type 2 diabetes. However, because this study was merely correlational, the direction of cause and effect between little sleep and diabetes is uncertain. The authors point to an earlier study which showed that experimental rather than habitual restriction of sleep resulted in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). =On the brain= One study suggested, based on neuroimaging, that 35 hours of total sleep deprivation in healthy controls negatively affected the brain's ability to put an emotional event into the proper perspective and make a controlled, suitable response to the event. The negative effects of sleep deprivation on alertness and cognitive performance suggest decreases in brain activity and function. These changes primarily occur in two regions: the thalamus, a structure involved in alertness and attention; and the prefrontal cortex, a region sub-serving alertness, attention, and higher-order cognitive processes. This was the finding of an American study in 2000. Seventeen men in their 20s were tested. Sleep deprivation was progressive with measurements of glucose (absolute regional CMRglu), cognitive performance, alertness, mood, and subjective experiences collected after 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours of sleep deprivation. Additional measures of alertness, cognitive performance, and mood were collected at fixed intervals. PET scans were used and attention was paid to the circadian rhythm of cognitive performance. A noted 2002 University of California animal study indicated that non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) is necessary for turning off neurotransmitters and allowing their receptors to \\"rest\\" and regain sensitivity which allows monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine) to be effective at naturally produced levels. This leads to improved regulation of mood and increased learning ability. The study also found that rapid eye movement sleep (REM) deprivation may alleviate clinical depression because it mimics selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This is because the natural decrease in monoamines during REM is not allowed to occur, which causes the concentration of neurotransmitters in the brain, that are depleted in clinically depressed persons, to increase. Sleep outside of the REM phase may allow enzymes to repair brain cell damage caused by free radicals. High metabolic activity while awake damages the enzymes themselves preventing efficient repair. This study observed the first evidence of brain damage in rats as a direct result of sleep deprivation. Animal studies suggest that sleep deprivation increases levels of stress hormones, which may reduce new cell production in adult brains.No sleep means no new brain cells . BBC (10 February 2007) =On growth= A 1999 study found that sleep deprivation resulted in reduced cortisol secretion the next day, driven by increased subsequent slow-wave sleep. Sleep deprivation was found to enhance activity on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (which controls reactions to stress and regulates body functions such as digestion, the immune system, mood, sex, or energy usage) while suppressing growth hormones. The results supported previous studies, which observed adrenal insufficiency in idiopathic hypersomnia. =On attention and working memory= Among the possible physical consequences of sleep deprivation, deficits in attention and working memory are perhaps the most important; such lapses in mundane routines can lead to unfortunate results, from forgetting ingredients while cooking to missing a sentence while taking notes. Performing tasks that require attention appears to be correlated with number of hours of sleep received each night, declining as a function of hours of sleep deprivation. Working memory is tested by such methods as choice-reaction time tasks. The attentional lapses also extend into more critical domains in which the consequences can be life- or-death; car crashes and industrial disasters can result from inattentiveness attributable to sleep deprivation. To empirically measure the magnitude of attention deficits, researchers typically employ the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) which requires the subject to press a button in response to a light at random intervals. Failure to press the button in response to the stimulus (light) is recorded as an error, attributable to the microsleeps that occur as a product of sleep deprivation. Crucially, individuals' subjective evaluations of their fatigue often do not predict actual performance on the PVT. While totally sleep-deprived individuals are usually aware of the degree of their impairment, lapses from chronic (lesser) sleep deprivation can build up over time so that they are equal in number and severity to the lapses occurring from total (acute) sleep deprivation. Chronically sleep-deprived people, however, continue to rate themselves considerably less impaired than totally sleep-deprived participants. Since people usually evaluate their capability on tasks like driving subjectively, their evaluations may lead them to the false conclusion that they can perform tasks that require constant attention when their abilities are in fact impaired. =On driving ability= The dangers of sleep deprivation are apparent on the road; the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) reports that one in every five serious motor vehicle injuries is related to driver fatigue, with 80,000 drivers falling asleep behind the wheel every day and 250,000 accidents every year related to sleep, though the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration suggests the figure for traffic accidents may be closer to 100,000. The AASM recommends pulling off the road and taking a 15- or 20-minute nap to alleviate drowsiness. According to a 2000 study published in the British Medical Journal, researchers in Australia and New Zealand reported that sleep deprivation can have some of the same hazardous effects as being drunk. People who drove after being awake for 17‚Äì19 hours performed worse than those with a blood alcohol level of 0.05 percent, which is the legal limit for drunk driving in most western European countries and Australia. Another study suggested that performance begins to degrade after 16 hours awake, and 21 hours awake was equivalent to a blood alcohol content of 0.08 percent, which is the blood alcohol limit for drunk driving in Canada, the U.S., and the U.K. Fatigue of drivers of goods trucks and passenger vehicles have come to the attention of authorities in many countries, where specific laws have been introduced with the aim of reducing the risk of traffic accidents due to driver fatigue. Rules concerning minimum break lengths, maximum shift lengths and minimum time between shifts are common in the driving regulations used in different countries and regions, such as the drivers' working hours regulations in the European Union and hours of service regulations in the United States. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill was the second largest oil spill in the United States. This accident occurred when an Exxon oil tanker struck a reef at the Prince William Sound in Alaska. Approximately 10.8 million gallons of oil spilled into the sea. The accident caused great environmental damage including the death of hundreds of thousands of birds and sea creatures. Fatigue and sleep deprivation were the major contributors to the accident. The captain of the ship was asleep after a night of heavy drinking; he was severely fatigued and had been awake for 18 hours. The entire crew was suffering from fatigue and inadequate sleep. =On sleep transition= Sleep propensity (SP) can be defined as the readiness to transit from wakefulness to sleep, or the ability to stay asleep if already sleeping.Schulz, H., Bes, E., Jobert, M. (1997). Modelling Sleep Propensity and Sleep Disturbances. In: Meier-Ewert K., Okawa M. (eds) Sleep‚ÄîWake Disorders. Springer. doi:10.1007/978-1-4899-0245-0_2 Sleep deprivation increases this propensity, which can be measured by polysomnography (PSG), as a reduction in sleep latency (the time needed to fall asleep). An indicator of sleep propensity can also be seen in the shortening of transition from light stages of non-REM sleep to deeper slow-waves oscillations can also be measured as indicator of sleep propensity. On average, the latency in healthy adults decreases by a few minutes after a night without sleep, and the latency from sleep onset to slow-wave sleep is halved. Sleep latency is generally measured with the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In contrast, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) also uses sleep latency, but this time as a measure of the capacity of the participants to stay awake (when asked to) instead of falling asleep. =On sleep-wake cycle= Research studying sleep deprivation shows its impact on mood, cognitive and motor functioning, due to dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle and augmented sleep propensity. Multiple studies that identified the role of the hypothalamus and multiple neural systems controlling circadian rhythms and homeostasis have been helpful in understanding sleep deprivation better. To describe the temporal course of the sleep-wake cycle, the two-process model of sleep regulation can be mentioned. This model proposes a homeostatic process (Process S) and a circadian process (Process C) that interact to define the time and intensity of sleep. Process S represents the drive for sleep, increasing during wakefulness and decreasing during sleep, until a defined threshold level, while Process C is the oscillator responsible for these levels. When being sleep deprived, homeostatic pressure accumulates to the point that waking functions will be degraded even at the highest circadian drive for wakefulness. =Other effects= The National Sleep Foundation identifies several warning signs that a driver is dangerously fatigued. These include rolling down the window, turning up the radio, trouble keeping eyes open, head-nodding, drifting out of their lane, and daydreaming. At particular risk are lone drivers between midnight and 6:00am. Sleep deprivation can negatively impact overall performance, and has led to major fatal accidents. Due largely to the February 2009 crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407, which killed 50 people and was partially attributed to pilot fatigue, the FAA reviewed its procedures to ensure that pilots are sufficiently rested. Air traffic controllers were under scrutiny when in 2010 there were 10 incidents of controllers falling asleep while on shift. The common practice of turn-around shifts caused sleep deprivation and was a contributing factor to all air traffic control incidents. The FAA reviewed its practices of shift changes and the findings saw that controllers were not well rested. A 2004 study also found medical residents with less than four hours of sleep a night made more than twice as many errors as the 11% of surveyed residents who slept for more than seven hours a night. Twenty-four hours of continuous sleep deprivation results in the choice of less difficult math tasks without decreases in subjective reports of effort applied to the task. Naturally caused sleep loss affects the choice of everyday tasks such that low effort tasks are mostly commonly selected. Adolescents who experience less sleep show a decreased willingness to engage in sports activities that require effort through fine motor coordination and attention to detail. Great sleep deprivation mimics psychosis: distorted perceptions can lead to inappropriate emotional and behavioral responses. Astronauts have reported performance errors and decreased cognitive ability during periods of extended working hours and wakefulness as well as due to sleep loss caused by circadian rhythm disruption and environmental factors. Microsleeps Microsleeps occur when a person has a significant sleep deprivation. Microsleeps usually last for a few seconds and happen most frequently when a person is trying to stay awake when they are feeling sleepy. The person usually falls into microsleep while doing a monotonous task like driving, reading a book, or staring at a computer. Microsleeps are similar to blackouts and a person experiencing them is not consciously aware that they are occurring. An even lighter type of sleep has been seen in rats that have been kept awake for long periods of time. In a process known as local sleep, specific localized brain regions went into periods of short (~80 ms) but frequent (~40/min) NREM-like states. Despite the on and off periods where neurons shut off, the rats appeared to be awake, although they performed poorly at tests. Weight gain  In rats, prolonged, complete sleep deprivation increased both food intake and energy expenditure with a net effect of weight loss and ultimately death. This study hypothesizes that the moderate chronic sleep debt associated with habitual short sleep is associated with increased appetite and energy expenditure with the equation tipped towards food intake rather than expenditure in societies where high-calorie food is freely available. Several large studies using nationally representative samples suggest that one of the causes of high obesity rates in the United States might be a corresponding decrease in the average number of hours that people are sleeping.Does the lack of sleep make you fat? , Bristol University Press Release, 7 December 2004 The findings suggest that this might be happening because sleep deprivation could be disrupting hormones that regulate glucose metabolism and appetite. Leptin is one of the hormones that communicate with one's brain to indicate that the body is full. When one becomes sleep deprived, leptin levels decrease, resulting in a more aggressive appetite. The association between sleep deprivation and obesity appears to be strongest in young and middle-age adults. Other scientists hold that the physical discomfort of obesity and related problems, such as sleep apnea, reduce an individual's chances of getting a good night's sleep. Sleep loss is currently proposed to disturb endocrine regulation of energy homeostasis leading to weight gain and obesity. For instance, laboratory sleep deprivation studies in young men have demonstrated that one night of wakefulness (typically found in shift workers) exerts significant effects on the energy balance the next morning, including reduced energy expenditure, enhanced hedonic stimulus processing in the brain underlying the drive to consume food, and overeating that goes beyond satiety. Further recent studies have shown that a reduction of sleep duration to four hours for two consecutive nights has been shown to decrease circulating leptin levels and to increase ghrelin levels, as well as self-reported hunger. Similar endocrine alterations have been shown to occur even after a single night of sleep restriction. In a balanced order, nine healthy normal-weight men spent three nights in a sleep laboratory separated by at least two weeks: one night with a total sleep time of seven hours, one night with a total sleep time of 4.5 hours, and one night with total sleep deprivation (SD). On a standard symptom-rating scale, subjects rated markedly stronger feelings of hunger after total SD than after seven hours of sleep (3.9 ¬± 0.7 versus 1.7 ¬± 0.3; P = 0.020) or 4.5 hours sleep (2.2 ¬± 0.5; P = 0.041). Plasma ghrelin levels were 22 ¬± 10% higher after total SD than after seven hours of sleep (0.85 ¬± 0.06 versus 0.72 ¬± 0.04 ng mL(‚àí1); P = 0.048) with intermediate levels of the hormone after 4.5 hours sleep (0.77 ¬± 0.04 ng mL(‚àí1)). Feelings of hunger as well as plasma ghrelin levels are already elevated after one night of SD, whereas morning serum leptin concentrations remain unaffected. Thus, the results provide further evidence for a disturbing influence of sleep loss on endocrine regulation of energy homeostasis, which in the long run may result in weight gain and obesity. Uses=To facilitate abusive control= Sleep deprivation can be used to disorientate abuse victims to help set them up for abusive control.Sleep Deprivation Used as Abuse TacticFamily and Domestic Violence - Healthy Work Healthy Living Tip Sheet =Interrogation= Sleep deprivation can be used as a means of interrogation, which has resulted in court trials over whether or not the technique is a form of torture. Under one interrogation technique, a subject might be kept awake for several days and when finally allowed to fall asleep, suddenly awakened and questioned. Menachem Begin, the Prime Minister of Israel from 1977 to 1983, described his experience of sleep deprivation as a prisoner of the NKVD in Soviet Union as follows: Sleep deprivation was one of the five techniques used by the British government in the 1970s. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the five techniques \\"did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture ... [but] amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment\\", in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.Ireland v. the United Kingdom paragraph 102 The United States Justice Department released four memos in August 2002 describing interrogation techniques used by the Central Intelligence Agency. They first described 10 techniques used in the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, described as a terrorist logistics specialist, including sleep deprivation. Memos signed by Steven G. Bradbury in May 2005 claimed that forced sleep deprivation for up to 180 hours ( days) by shackling a diapered prisoner to the ceiling did not constitute torture, nor did the combination of multiple interrogation methods (including sleep deprivation) constitute torture under United States law. These memoranda were repudiated and withdrawn during the first months of the Obama administration. The question of extreme use of sleep deprivation as torture has advocates on both sides of the issue. In 2006, Australian Federal Attorney-General Philip Ruddock argued that sleep deprivation does not constitute torture. Nicole Bieske, a spokeswoman for Amnesty International Australia, has stated the opinion of her organization thus: \\"At the very least, sleep deprivation is cruel, inhumane and degrading. If used for prolonged periods of time it is torture.\\" =Depression= Studies show that sleep restriction has some potential in the treatment of depression. Those who suffer from depression tend to have earlier occurrences of REM sleep with an increased number of rapid eye movements; therefore, monitoring patients' EEG and awakening them during occurrences of REM sleep appears to have a therapeutic effect, alleviating depressive symptoms. This kind of treatment is known as wake therapy. As many as 60% of patients, when sleep- deprived, show immediate recovery, although most relapse the following night. The effect has been shown to be linked to increases in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). It has been shown that chronotype is related to the effect of sleep deprivation on mood in normal people: those with morningness preference become more depressed following sleep deprivation while those with eveningness preference show an improvement in mood. A comprehensive evaluation of the human metabolome in sleep deprivation in 2014 found that 27 metabolites are increased after 24 waking hours and suggested serotonin, tryptophan, and taurine may contribute to the antidepressive effect. The incidence of relapse can be decreased by combining sleep deprivation with medication or a combination of light therapy and phase advance (going to bed substantially earlier than ones normal time). Many tricyclic antidepressants suppress REM sleep, providing additional evidence for a link between mood and sleep.Disorders That Disrupt Sleep (Parasomnias) . eMedicineHealth Similarly, tranylcypromine has been shown to completely suppress REM sleep at adequate doses. = Insomnia = Sleep deprivation can be implemented for a short period of time in the treatment of insomnia. Some common sleep disorders have been shown to respond to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. One of the components is a controlled regime of \\"sleep restriction\\" in order to restore the homeostatic drive to sleep and encourage normal \\"sleep efficiency\\". The main goal of stimulus control and sleep restriction therapy is to create an association between bed and sleep. Taken on its own, sleep restriction therapy measures have not yet proven to show efficacy. Sleep restriction therapy does show efficacy when applied as an element of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Causes=Insomnia= Insomnia, one of the six types of dyssomnia, affects 21%-37% of the adult population. Many of its symptoms are easily recognizable, including excessive daytime sleepiness; frustration or worry about sleep; problems with attention, concentration, or memory; extreme mood changes or irritability; lack of energy or motivation; poor performance at school or work; and tension headaches or stomach aches. Insomnia can be grouped into primary and secondary, or comorbid, insomnia. Primary insomnia is a sleep disorder not attributable to a medical, psychiatric, or environmental cause. There are three main types of primary insomnia. These include: psychophysiological, idiopathic insomnia, and sleep state misperception (paradoxical insomnia). Psychophysiological insomnia is anxiety-induced. Idiopathic insomnia generally begins in childhood and lasts the rest of a person's life. It's suggested that idiopathic insomnia is a neurochemical problem in a part of the brain that controls the sleep-wake cycle, resulting in either under-active sleep signals or over-active wake signals. Sleep state misperception is diagnosed when people get enough sleep but inaccurately perceive that their sleep is insufficient. Secondary insomnia, or comorbid insomnia, occurs concurrently with other medical, neurological, psychological and psychiatric conditions. Causation is not necessarily implied.Biological Rhythms, Sleep and Hypnosis by Simon Green Sleep is known to be cumulative. This means that the fatigue and sleep one lost as a result, for example, staying awake all night, would be carried over to the following day. Not getting enough sleep a couple days cumulatively builds up a deficiency and that's when all the symptoms of sleep deprivation come in. When one is well rested and healthy, the body naturally spends not as much time in the REM stage of sleep. The more time one's body spends in REM sleep, causes one to be exhausted, less time in that stage will promote more energy when awakened. Voluntary Sleep deprivation can sometimes be self-imposed due to a lack of desire to sleep or the habitual use of stimulant drugs. Sleep deprivation is also self-imposed to achieve personal fame in the context of record-breaking stunts. =Sleep apnea= Obstructive sleep apnea is often caused by collapse of the upper airway during sleep, which reduces airflow to the lungs. Those who suffer from sleep apnea may experience symptoms such as awakening gasping or choking, restless sleep, morning headaches, morning confusion or irritability and restlessness. This disorder affects between 1 and 10 percent of Americans. It has many serious health outcomes if untreated. Positive airway pressure therapy using a CPAP (Continuous positive airway pressure), APAP or BPAP devices is considered to be the first line treatment option for sleep apnea.Spicuzza L, Caruso D, Di Maria G. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and its management. Therapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease. 2015;6(5):273-285. doi:10.1177/2040622315590318. Mandibular displacement devices in some cases can reposition the jaw and tongue to prevent the airway from collapsing. For some patients supplemental oxygen therapy may be indicated. Nasal problems such as a deviated septum will shut down the airway and increase swelling in the mucus lining and nasal turbinates. Corrective surgery (septoplasty) in some cases may be an appropriate choice of treatment. Central sleep apnea is caused by a failure of the central nervous system to signal the body to breathe during sleep. Treatments similar to obstructive sleep apnea may be used as well as other treatments such as Adaptive Servo Ventilation and certain medications. Some medications such as opioids may contribute to or cause central sleep apnea. =Mental illness= The specific causal relationships between sleep loss and effects on psychiatric disorders have been most extensively studied in patients with mood disorders. Shifts into mania in bipolar patients are often preceded by periods of insomnia, and sleep deprivation has been shown to induce a manic state in susceptible individuals. Sleep deprivation may represent a final common pathway in the genesis of mania, and sleep loss is both a precipitating and reinforcing factor for the manic state. The symptoms of sleep deprivation and those of schizophrenia are paralleled, including those of positive and cognitive symptoms. =School= The National Sleep Foundation cites a 1996 paper showing that college/university-aged students got an average of less than 6 hours of sleep each night. A 2018 study highlights the need for a good night's sleep for students finding that college students who averaged eight hours of sleep for the five nights of finals week scored higher on their final exams than those who didn't. In the study, 70.6% of students reported obtaining less than 8 hours of sleep, and up to 27% of students may be at risk for at least one sleep disorder. Sleep deprivation is common in first year college students as they adjust to the stress and social activities of college life. A study performed by the Department of Psychology at the National Chung Cheng University in Taiwan concluded that freshmen received the least amount of sleep during the week. Studies of later start times in schools have consistently reported benefits to adolescent sleep, health and learning using a wide variety of methodological approaches. In contrast, there are no studies showing that early start times have any positive impact on sleep, health or learning. \\"Astronomical\\" data from international studies demonstrate that \\"synchronised\\" start times for adolescents are far later than the start times in the overwhelming majority of educational institutions. In 1997, University of Minnesota research compared students who started school at 7:15 am with those who started at 8:40 am. They found that students who started at 8:40 got higher grades and more sleep on weekday nights than those who started earlier. One in four U.S. high school students admits to falling asleep in class at least once a week. It is known that during human adolescence, circadian rhythms and therefore sleep patterns typically undergo marked changes. Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies indicate a 50% reduction of deep (stage 4) sleep and a 75% reduction in the peak amplitude of delta waves during NREM sleep in adolescence. School schedules are often incompatible with a corresponding delay in sleep offset, leading to a less than optimal amount of sleep for the majority of adolescents. = Hospital stay = A study performed nationwide in the Netherlands found that general ward patients staying at the hospital experienced shorter total sleep (83 min. less), more night-time awakenings, and earlier awakenings compared to sleeping at home. Over 70% experienced being woken up by external causes, such as hospital staff (35.8%). Sleep disturbing factors included noise of other patients, medical devices, pain, and toilet visits. Sleep deprivation is even more severe in ICU patients, where the naturally occurring nocturnal peak of melatonin secretion was found to be absent, possibly causing the disruption in the normal sleep-wake cycle. However, as the personal characteristics and the clinical picture of hospital patients are so diverse, the possible solutions to improve sleep and circadian rhythmicity should be tailored to the individual and within the possibilities of the hospital ward. Multiple interventions could be considered to aid patient characteristics, improve hospital routines, or the hospital environment. = Internet = Study published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organisation found out that the broadband internet connection was associated with sleep deprivation. The study concluded that the people with a broadband connection tend to sleep 25 minutes less than those without the broadband connection, hence they are less likely to get the scientifically recommended 7‚Äì9 hours of sleep. Treatment Sleep deprivation is not a disease but rather a symptom of illnesses such as insomnia. Several strategies are common in attempting to increase alertness and counteract the effects of sleep deprivation. Caffeine is often used over short periods to boost wakefulness when acute sleep deprivation is experienced; however, caffeine is less effective if taken routinely. Other strategies recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine include prophylactic sleep before deprivation, naps, other stimulants, and combinations thereof. However, the only sure and safe way to combat sleep deprivation is to increase nightly sleep time. The Center for Disease Control suggests the following tips to improve sleeping habits. Firstly, have a consistent sleep schedule, wake up and go to bed at the same time everyday including the weekends. Secondly, removing computers, televisions, and other smart devices from a persons bedroom to avoid the use of electronics before bed. Finally, attempt to remain active throughout the day and avoid ingesting large meals and caffeine before bed. Recovery of cognitive function is accomplished more rapidly after acute total sleep deprivation than after chronic partial sleep restriction. Chronic deprivation is the more common in everyday life. Just one night of recovery sleep can reverse adverse effects of total sleep deprivation. Recovery sleep is more efficient than normal sleep with shorter sleep latency and increased amounts of deep and REM sleep. For long term involuntary sleep deprivation, cognitive behavioral therapy for Insomnia (CBT-i) is now commonly recommended as a first-line treatment, after exclusion of physical diagnosis (f.e. sleep apnea). CBT-i contains five different components: cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation. These components together have shown to be effective in adults, with clinical meaningful effect sizes As this approach has minimal adverse effects, and long-term benefits, it is often preferred to (chronic) drug therapy.  Changes in American sleep habits  National Geographic Magazine has reported that the demands of work, social activities, and the availability of 24-hour home entertainment and Internet access have caused people to sleep less now than in premodern times.\\"U.S. Racking Up Huge \\"Sleep Debt\\"\\" , National Geographic Magazine, 24 February 2005 USA Today reported in 2007 that most adults in the USA get about an hour less than the average sleep time 40 years ago. Other researchers have questioned these claims. A 2004 editorial in the journal Sleep stated that according to the available data, the average number of hours of sleep in a 24-hour period has not changed significantly in recent decades among adults. Furthermore, the editorial suggests that there is a range of normal sleep time required by healthy adults, and many indicators used to suggest chronic sleepiness among the population as a whole do not stand up to scientific scrutiny. A comparison of data collected from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' American Time Use Survey from 1965‚Äì1985 and 1998‚Äì2001 has been used to show that the median amount of sleep, napping, and resting done by the average adult American has changed by less than 0.7%, from a median of 482 minutes per day from 1965 through 1985, to 479 minutes per day from 1998 through 2001. Longest periods without sleep Randy Gardner holds the scientifically documented record for the longest period of time a human being has intentionally gone without sleep not using stimulants of any kind. Gardner stayed awake for 264 hours (11 days), breaking the previous record of 260 hours held by Tom Rounds of Honolulu. LCDR John J. Ross of the U.S. Navy Medical Neuropsychiatric Research Unit later published an account of this event, which became well known among sleep-deprivation researchers. The Guinness World Record stands at 449 hours (18 days, 17 hours), held by Maureen Weston, of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire in April 1977, in a rocking-chair marathon. Claims of total sleep deprivation lasting years have been made several times, but none are scientifically verified. Claims of partial sleep deprivation are better documented. For example, Rhett Lamb of St. Petersburg, Florida was initially reported to not sleep at all, but actually had a rare condition permitting him to sleep only one to two hours per day in the first three years of his life. He had a rare abnormality called an Arnold‚ÄìChiari malformation where brain tissue protrudes into the spinal canal and the skull puts pressure on the protruding part of the brain. The boy was operated on at All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg in May 2008. Two days after surgery he slept through the night. French sleep expert Michel Jouvet and his team reported the case of a patient who was quasi-sleep-deprived for four months, as confirmed by repeated polygraphic recordings showing less than 30 minutes (of stage-1 sleep) per night, a condition they named \\"agrypnia\\". The 27-year-old man was suffering from Morvan's fibrillary chorea, a rare disease that leads to involuntary movements, and in this particular case, extreme insomnia. The researchers found that treatment with 5-HTP restored almost normal sleep stages. However some months after this recovery the patient died during a relapse which was unresponsive to 5-HTP. The cause of death was pulmonary edema. Despite the extreme insomnia, psychological investigation showed no sign of cognitive deficits, except for some hallucinations. Fatal familial insomnia is a neurodegenerative disease eventually resulting in a complete inability to go past stage 1 of NREM sleep. In addition to insomnia, patients may experience panic attacks, paranoia, phobias, hallucinations, rapid weight loss, and dementia. Death usually occurs between 7 and 36 months from onset.

Turner's viewpoints typically encompass Holocaust denial, conspiracy theory, white supremacy, and have included calls for assassination of government officials. In August 2010, he was convicted for making threats against three federal judges with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, for which he spent two years in prison. Turner has sporadically hosted The Hal Turner Show, usually on shortwave radio station WBCQ, since 2002, as well as a corresponding blog, which has changed URLs frequently and has spread hoaxes and fake news. Early life Turner was born in Jersey City and raised in Union City and from age five in Ridgefield Park, where he attended Ridgefield Park High School.\\"What makes Hal Turner run?\\", The Hudson Reporter, March 20, 2000. Accessed November 26, 2019. \\"Turner was born in Jersey City and lived in Union City until he was five years old, when his family moved to Ridgefield Park, where he was raised and attended high school.\\" Prior to working on radio, Turner worked as a driver and a salesman. Early career Identifying himself as \\"Hal from North Bergen\\", Turner became notable in American conservative circles as a frequent caller to and supporter of WABC radio talk show hosts Bob Grant and Sean Hannity. Turner parlayed this fame into a role as the northern New Jersey coordinator for Patrick J. Buchanan's 1992 presidential campaign. Turner claims he established a friendship with Sean Hannity, on whose radio program he had once been a frequent presence. In 2008, while Hannity and Malik Zulu Shabazz of the New Black Panther Party were debating Barack Obama's association with Jeremiah Wright, Shabazz asked Hannity if he should \\"be judged by (his) promotion and association with Hal Turner\\". Hannity began to say that he didn't know Turner, but then said he was someone he had banned from his radio program ten years before. Turner subsequently gave an account of their association on his website, in which he said of Hannity's response: \\"I was quite disappointed when Sean Hannity at first tried to say he didn't know me. In fact, Sean does know me and we were quite friendly a few years ago.\\" Phil Boyce, Program Director of WABC, disputed the account, which described a friendship developing between Turner and Hannity in 1993, three years before Hannity was actually hired at WABC. Turner became a talk radio host, joining fellow regular callers Frank from Queens and John from Staten Island to start the program The Right Perspective. Turner left the program in 2002, citing artistic differences. In 2002, Turner became a solo host, purchasing a time slot on shortwave radio station WBCQ, over which he broadcast for approximately four years. On WBCQ on March 22, 2004 he left the show \\"after harshly criticizing his supporters, listeners, and WBCQ.\\" The show lacked financial support and Turner had health problems,Turner was in the hospital a number of times in 2003 and 2004 (dead link) leading to the temporary closure of his website and show. Activism and assault claims In the 2000 US congress election, Turner sought the Republican Party nomination for election to the United States Congress from New Jersey's 13th congressional district. He received 18.6% of the vote, losing to Theresa de Leon. Turner has identified himself as the \\"Chairman of the Republican Party of Hudson County, NJ Corp,\\" a group which has no connection to the official Hudson County Republican Party recognized by the state and national party. According to news reports, Hudson County Republican officials have stated that Turner's party is a \\"paper corporation with little or no membership\\". In response to an October 7, 2005, assault against a white student by a black student at Kingston High School, Turner, working with the white nationalist group National Vanguard, organized a rally which he called a \\"rally against violence\\". He characterized the rally as both \\"pro-white\\" and \\"against violence\\". The victim's mother chose not to attend the rally. In response, local residents, including political and religious leaders, organized a number of \\"Unity Rallies\\" with a tolerance theme. When the rally occurred on November 19, 2005, Turner and the National Vanguard attracted approximately 50 demonstrators, compared to the 100 counter-demonstrators. Turner called for the attacker to be charged with a hate crime, but the case resulted in the perpetrator being indicted as an adult with two felony counts: assault and attempted assault instead. On April 12, 2006, Turner had a physical altercation with Jaime Vazquez, a former Jersey City Deputy Mayor and a member of the Jersey City Council, who was the Jersey City Commissioner of Veterans Affairs at the time. The North Bergen Reporter quoted Turner as saying \\"(t)he illegal immigrants are breaking the law, and people like me should break the law as well by shooting them down.\\" In response, Vazquez picketed with a sign reading \\"Hal Turner ‚Äî shoot me! Racists and bigots like you are cowards.\\" This was followed by a physical confrontation, during which Vazquez suffered a back injury and a fractured wrist. Turner and Vazquez later filed criminal charges against each other. On July 16, 2006 North Bergen Municipal Court Judge Joseph Romano found both men to be equally credible and thus neither criminally liable. Broadcasting and website issues In 2002, Turner started broadcasting, but quit the show in July 2008 and resumed broadcasting it in April 2009 as the Turner Radio Network. In August 2008 his website also closed. Although he retained a blog, it was shut down by his host, Google's Blogger, for violations of terms of service. =Origin of China eminent domain hoax= In February 2009, Turner posted an article on his blog entitled: \\"FEDS GRANT EMINENT DOMAIN AS COLLATERAL TO CHINA FOR U.S. DEBTS!\\" claiming that a secret agreement had been made to allow China to physically take U.S. land, in the event of a U.S. default. The story created \\"hundreds of identical Internet replications\\" according to Snopes.\\"the story appears only in the blog of former radio host Hal Turner ... and in hundreds of identical Internet replications\\" =Anonymous website raid= Turner stated that in December 2006 and January 2007 individuals who identified themselves as members of the group Anonymous took Turner's website offline, costing him thousands of dollars in bandwidth bills. On January 19, 2007 Turner sued 4chan, eBaum's World, 7chan, Abjects IRC network, and other websites for copyright infringement. On January 22, 2007 he lost his plea for an injunction. In February 2007 4chan responded to the lawsuit. In April 2007, the judge asked the parties to submit information to schedule proceedings. However, Turner failed to respond. Mail from the court to Turner was returned as \\"Undeliverable\\". The judge dismissed the case in December 2007. =FBI informant= Turner was a paid informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for several years, supplying information about right-wing groups to federal agents. The original allegations that Turner acted as an informant for the FBI surfaced in 2008 after unidentified hackers claimed on Turner's website's forums that they had read email correspondences between him and an FBI agent, apparently his handler. This led to a discussion on a neo- Nazi website on January 10, 2008, in which Turner revealed that he was quitting political work, ending his radio show and separating \\"from the 'pro- White' movement\\". The FBI has declined to comment on the matter. The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League reported on the emails that \\"a neo-Nazi Website had posted material reportedly found by the hackers, including alleged exchanges between himself and law enforcement agents which indicated that Turner had been providing information to them.\\" On July 28, 2009 in a Chicago courtroom, Turner's defense lawyer said that Turner worked as a paid informant for the FBI. In December 2009, The Record published an investigative report on Turner's \\"complex\\" relationship with the FBI and Federal U.S. Marshal Service, noting that all parties broke off contact at several points. Turner's information led to the arrests of the Hutaree militia, with Turner's FBI handler serving as the prosecution's witness. Michael A. Orozco, Turner's lawyer said, \\"I don't think he was a racist. He was doing a lot of those things at the behest of the FBI.\\" =Return to radio= On October 7, 2015, Turner returned to radio for the weekly, two hour Hal Turner Show, broadcast on shortwave radio station WBCQ and over the internet. For a time in 2015, Turner promoted another broadcast over \\"Superstation 95,\\" a pirate radio station in the New York City area. The show aired until February 1, 2017, and then resumed on July 5, 2017, eventually adding another shortwave affiliate, WRMI. Turner stated at the end of March 2019 that he had run out of funds to keep the show on WBCQ and WRMI. An associated fundraising appeal was a success, and Turner expanded his broadcast to a daily show. Turner also claims KYAH in Delta, Utah as a standard AM radio affiliate. KYAH, which broadcasts at low power during Turner's show, lists the time slot in its program schedule as \\"TBA.\\" Threats against judges and political figures Turner has a history of making threats against various public figures. In 2005, Turner publicized the names of three federal court judges who handled lawsuits involving Matt Hale, a white supremacist convicted of soliciting the murder of a federal judge. Turner posted the judges' names and addresses on his Web site.Haunted by Threats, U.S. Judge Finds New Horror New York Times March 2, 2005 On December 6, 2006, Turner announced on his website: > We may have to ASSASSINATE some of the people you elect on Nov. 7!

He alleged that his website has been the target of denial of service attacks, and subsequently filed a pro se lawsuit.Dallas Morning News. Hate-talk radio host down in mouth . February 6, 2007Hal Turner's blog (defunct as of 11-07-07) On April 4, 2008, Turner encouraged violence against Lexington, Massachusetts school superintendent Paul Ash for establishing a new curriculum supporting homosexuals. On his website, he stated: > I advocate parents using FORCE AND VIOLENCE against Superintendent Paul B. > Ash as a method of defending the health and safety of school children > presently being endangered through his correct indoctrination into deadly, > disease-ridden sodomite lifestyles.Lexington superintendent threatened by > radio host - Framingham, MA - The MetroWest Daily News He went on to provide Ash's personal information, including his address. Fourteen months later, on June 2, 2009, Turner posted on his blog > Let me be the first to say this plainly: These judges deserve to be killed. > Their blood will replenish the tree of liberty. A small price to pay to > assure freedom for millions. The next day Turner posted information on how to find Chief Judge Frank Easterbrook and Judges Richard Posner and William Joseph Bauer. =Arrests, trials, and conviction= On June 3, 2009, Turner was arrested in New Jersey and charged with inciting injury to two politicians in Connecticut and a state ethics official. The warrant issued was for inciting his website's readers to \\"take up arms\\" against the officials. Two weeks later, Turner was re-arrested on June 24, 2009 at his New Jersey home for making threats against the judges of the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago. When he was arrested, FBI officials seized 200 rounds of ammunition as well as three handguns and one shotgun. In the federal case, Turner was denied bail. On June 30, 2009, the website for Turner's blog was shut down and replaced with a notice stating that the site had been taken down by Turner's family, directing interested parties to a blog for the Family of Hal Turner, with entries by his mother. United States v. Turner On July 28, 2009 in the case of United States v. Turner in Chicago, Turner pleaded not guilty to threatening to kill three federal appellate judges there and then sought his release from custody, saying he had been an informant for the FBI. The judge gave Turner ten days \\"to produce concrete evidence of Turner's help to the FBI or federal marshals.\\" On August 11, Turner was denied bail again. The judge cited the fact that Turner, from his prison cell, recorded and posted on the internet a telephone conversation that included the names of his arresting FBI agents. The judge said that Turner's act \\"tells me something about the disposition of Mr. Turner.\\" His lawyer said the defense would use \\"Turner's background as an FBI informant\\" and argue that he was \\"trained by the FBI\\" as \\"an agent provocateur\\" to incite people.\\" In late October 2009 Turner was freed on $500,000 bond, and was ordered not to use a computer or any device that can access the Internet. His trial started on November 30, 2009 and ended on December 4, 2009, with the defense opting not to call any witnesses. After two hours of deliberation, the jury announced it was deadlocked. Three days later the judge declared a mistrial, and a retrial was set for March 1, 2010. This second trial, overseen by Western District of Louisiana judge Donald Walter, was moved from the Northern District of Illinois to the Eastern District of New York: since the prosecution was to call the three judges to the stand, the defense felt that Turner would not get a fair hearing if the trial was conducted in the same city where the judges worked. A mistrial was declared on March 10. In August 2010, his third trial began and on August 31, after three days of testimony, the jury found Turner guilty.\\"Local shock jock sentenced to almost three years in prison\\", Year in Review: The Hudson Reporter, December 26, 2010, page 13 On 21 December 2010, he was sentenced to 33 months in prison. Upon completion of his sentence, he was barred from participating in Internet or satellite radio programming for three years. In his sentencing memorandum, U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald made the following comment: > For years, Turner has engaged in a campaign of intimidation against public > officials and private citizens alike. Even Turner's arrest in this case > failed to deter him. Turner continued his tactics by using intimidation > against a key witness in the government's case against him. All the while, > Turner has displayed defiance and no regret for his actions. Turner remains > utterly incapable of acknowledging the genuine fear experienced by his > innumerable victims ‚Äì that is, except when he is the victim of a perceived > threat. Turner has committed a serious crime, engaged in witness > intimidation, lied repeatedly under oath, and has shown no regret > whatsoever. After his conviction, Turner was incarcerated in the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn,United States of America vs Harold Turner, Government's Sentencing Memorandum 2010 and was later moved to the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute. In May, he sent letters to The Jersey Journal saying he is one of 38 people housed in Communication Management Unit in the prison Terre Haute with terrorists, like John Walker Lindh, and fears for his life once fellow prisoners find out he was a government informant. During his incarceration, Turner declared bankruptcy, and his wife filed for divorce. In August 2011, Turner filed an appeal for his conviction. He claimed that the government \\"failed to substantiate the charge\\" and asked to be released pending the appeal. Connecticut v. Turner In July 2009 the Connecticut case was handed to a division of the state court that handles more serious matters. In early February 2011, Turner appeared in a Hartford court for the Connecticut v. Turner pre-trial hearing on three counts of inciting injuries to persons. The three felony counts Turner faced each carried one to 10 years in prison. In late February 2011, the federal government reported that e-mails \\"show it appears Turner plans to pursue judicial and law-enforcement officials after he's released from prison.\\" On February 2, Turner wrote \\"when I get out, I'm gonna go after some 'problems' and take care of them in a manner that will be horrific.\\" On March 25, 2011, Turner appeared in Hartford asking the court to be allowed to change his attorney, telling the judge, \\"I have no confidence in his ability to defend me.\\" The judge reluctantly allowed him to change his private attorney for a public defender citing Turner's unusually bad year. On April 7, with a public defender at his side, Turner pleaded not guilty and the case will go to trial. In July 2011, Turner's public defender asked for the case to be dismissed, saying Turner's statements were free speech and that Connecticut courts did not have jurisdiction because his threats were made in New Jersey. Prosecutor Thomas Garcia responded that Turner himself wrote that his intent behind the writing was to \\"foment direct action\\" against the lawmakers \\"personally.\\" In September 2011, Turner asked Judge Carl J. Schuman for permission to represent himself after disagreeing with his public defender, John Stawicki, about defense strategy. Judge Schuman agreed, but Stawicki remained as stand-by counsel. That same week jury selection began. On September 16, 2011 after three hours of deliberation, Turner was found not guilty of \\"felony inciting injury to people and misdemeanor threatening.\\" After hugging his family, Turner was \\"escorted back into custody\\" to continue serving his sentence in the federal case. Turner was released from prison on October 5, 2012.Harold Charles Turner, inmate # 30057-050; ReferencesExternal links * HalTurnerRadioShow.com (Turner's current site as of 2019) * www.halturnershow.com (defunct) archived at Archive.org * Blog with updates on his status * Follow-up interview with The Nation: \\"Max Blumenthal Probes Hannity's History With Talk Radio's 'Angry White Men' -- and Fanning the Flames of Racial Politics\\" * Anti-Defamation League: \\"Turner in his own words\\" * Southern Poverty Law Center: \\"The Host of Hate: Harold C.

The first installment in the Metroid series, it was originally released in Japan for the Family Computer Disk System peripheral in August 1986. North America received a release in August 1987 on the Nintendo Entertainment System in a ROM cartridge format, with the European release following in January 1988. Set on the planet Zebes, the story follows Samus Aran as she attempts to retrieve the parasitic Metroid organisms that were stolen by Space Pirates, who plan to replicate the Metroids by exposing them to beta rays and then use them as biological weapons to destroy Samus and all who oppose them. Metroid was developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 (Nintendo R&D1;) and Intelligent Systems. It was produced by Gunpei Yokoi, directed by Satoru Okada and Masao Yamamoto, and scored by Hirokazu Tanaka. The game's style, focusing on exploration and the search for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas, influenced other video games. Its varied endings for fast completion times made it a popular game for speedrunning. It was lauded for being one of the first video games to feature a female protagonist, though the player must complete the game in under five hours for this to be revealed, with the game's English-language instruction manual even using \\"he\\" to refer to the protagonist. It was both a critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised its graphics, soundtrack, and tight controls. Nintendo Power ranked Metroid 11th on their list of the best games for a Nintendo console. On Top 100 Games lists, it was ranked 7th by Game Informer and 69th by Electronic Gaming Monthly. The game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004 as part of the Classic NES Series. It was emulated for the Virtual Console service on various Nintendo platforms since 2007. It is currently available to play through Nintendo Switch Online. Gameplay alt=A video game screenshot of a protagonist in a powered exoskeleton, traveling through a cave while winged monsters fly down from the ceiling. Metroid is an action-adventure game in which the player controls Samus Aran in sprite-rendered two-dimensional landscapes. The game takes place on the fictional planet of Zebes, a large, open-ended world with areas connected by doors and elevators. The player controls Samus as she travels through the planet's caverns and hunts Space Pirates. She begins with a weak power beam as her only weapon, and with only the ability to jump. The player explores more areas and collects power-ups that grant Samus special abilities and enhance her armor and weaponry, allowing her to enter areas that were previously inaccessible. Among the power-ups that are included in the game are the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to curl into a ball to roll into tunnels; the Bomb, which can only be used while in ball form and can open hidden floor/wall paths; and the Screw Attack, a somersaulting move that destroys enemies in its path. In addition to common enemies, Samus encounters two bosses, Kraid and Ridley, whom she must defeat in order to progress. Ordinary enemies typically yield additional energy or ammunition when destroyed, and the player can increase Samus's carrying capacities by finding storage tanks and defeating bosses. Once Kraid and Ridley have both been defeated, the player can shoot their statues to open the path to the final area and confront the Mother Brain. Plot In the year 20X5, the Space Pirates attack a Galactic Federation-owned space research vessel and seize samples of Metroid creatures‚Äîthe parasitic lifeforms discovered on the planet SR388. Dangerous floating organisms, the Metroids can latch on to any organism and drain its life energy to kill it. The Space Pirates plan to replicate Metroids by exposing them to beta rays and then using them as biological weapons to destroy all living beings that oppose them. While searching for the stolen Metroids, the Galactic Federation locates the Space Pirates' base of operations on the planet Zebes. The Federation assaults the planet, but the Pirates resist, forcing the Federation to retreat. As a last resort, the Federation decides to send a lone bounty hunter to penetrate the Pirates' base and destroy Mother Brain, the biomechanical life-form that controls the Space Pirates' fortress and its defenses. Considered the greatest of all bounty hunters, Samus Aran is chosen for the mission. Samus lands on the surface of Zebes and explores the planet, travelling through the planet's caverns. She eventually comes across Kraid, an ally of the Space Pirates, and Ridley, the Space Pirates' commander, and defeats them both. Eventually, Samus finds and destroys Mother Brain. A timed bomb is then placed to destroy the lair, and she must escape before it explodes. Development Yoshio Sakamoto, a character designer for Metroid, speaking at the 2010 alt=Portrait of Yoshio Sakamoto, making a public speech. After Nintendo's release of commercially successful platforming games in the 1980s, including Donkey Kong (1981), Ice Climber (1985), and Super Mario Bros. (1985), as well as the critically acclaimed adventure game The Legend of Zelda (1986), the company began work on an action game. The game was dubbed Metroid, which is a portmanteau of the words \\"metro\\" and \\"android\\". It was co-developed by Nintendo's Research and Development 1 division and Intelligent Systems, and produced by Gunpei Yokoi. Metroid was directed by Satoru Okada and Masao Yamamoto (credited as \\"Yamamoto\\"), and featured music written by Hirokazu Tanaka (credited as \\"Hip Tanaka\\"). Makoto Kano (credited under his last name) was tasked to create the scenario, and Hiroji Kiyotake (credited under his last name), Hirofumi Matsuoka (credited as \\"New Matsuoka\\") and Yoshio Sakamoto (credited as \\"Shikamoto\\") designed the game's characters. The character design for Samus Aran was created by Kiyotake. The production was described as a \\"very free working environment\\" by Tanaka, who stated that, despite being the composer, he also gave input for the game's graphics and helped name the game's areas. Part way through development, one of the developers asked the others, \\"Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?\\" This idea was incorporated into the game, though the English-language instruction manual for the game uses the pronoun \\"he\\" many times in reference to Samus. Ridley Scott's 1979 horror film Alien was described by Sakamoto as a \\"huge influence\\" on Metroid after the game's world had been created. The development staff was affected by the work of the film's creature designer H. R. Giger, and found his creations to be fitting for the Metroid universe. Still, there were problems in progressing the development in spite of the approaching release date that eventually led Sakamoto to be \\"forcefully asked to participate\\" by his superiors, hoping his previous experience could help Metroid team get the job done. Sakamoto stated he figured out a way to bypass the limited resources and time to leverage existing assets \\"to create variation and an exciting experience\\". Nintendo attempted to set Metroid apart from other games by making it a nonlinear adventure-based game, in which exploration was a crucial part of the experience. The game often requires that players retrace their steps to progress, forcing the player to scroll the screen left in addition to moving it right, as was the case in most contemporary games. Metroid was also considered one of the first video games to impress a feeling of desperation and solitude on the player. Following The Legend of Zelda, Metroid helped pioneer the idea of acquiring tools to strengthen characters and help progress through the game. Up until that point, most ability-enhancing power-ups like the Power Shot in Gauntlet (1985) and the Starman in Super Mario Bros. offered only temporary boosts to characters, and they were not required to complete the game. In Metroid, however, items were permanent fixtures that lasted until the end. In particular, missiles and the ice beam were required to finish the game. After defeating Mother Brain, the player is given an end screen based on the time it took them to get there. Metroid is one of the first games to contain multiple endings, with five in total. In the third, fourth, and fifth endings, Samus Aran appears without her suit, and for the first time, reveals herself to be a woman. In Japan, the Disk Card media used by the Disk System allowed players to save up to three different games in Metroid, similar to the three save slots in The Legend of Zelda in the West. Use of an internal battery to manage files was not fully realized in time for Metroids international release. The Western versions of Metroid use a password system that was new to the industry at the time, in which players write down a 24-letter code and re-enter it into the game when they wish to continue a previous session. Codes also allow for changes in gameplay; the \\"NARPAS SWORD\\" grants Samus infinite ammunition, health, all power-ups, and a modified Ice Beam. The \\"JUSTIN BAILEY\\" code lets the player play as Samus without her Power Suit, which was thought by some to be the only way to use the feature; however, it is available simply by beating the game quickly enough to reveal Samus wearing a leotard at the ending sequence. =Music= Tanaka said he wanted to make a score that made players feel like they were encountering a \\"living organism\\" and had no distinction between music and sound effects. The only time a melodic theme is heard is when Mother Brain is defeated in order to give the victorious player catharsis. During the rest of the game, the melodies are more minimalistic, because Tanaka wanted the soundtrack to be the opposite of the \\"hummable\\" pop tunes found in other games at that time.  Release  Famicom Disk System package art Officially defined as a scrolling shooter video game, Nintendo released Metroid for the Famicom Disk System in Japan on August 6, 1986. An arcade version of the game was released in August 1986 as part of Nintendo's PlayChoice-10. It was released on the Nintendo Entertainment System a year later on August 15, 1987 in North America, and on January 15, 1988 in Europe. =Emulation= The game was re-released several times after its original launch via emulation. Linking the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion (2002) with the GameCube's Metroid Prime (2002) using a link cable unlocks the full version of Metroid on the GameCube. The game was also available as a bonus upon completion of Metroid: Zero Mission (2004). Additionally, a stand-alone version of Metroid for the Game Boy Advance, part of the Classic NES Series collection, was released in Japan on August 10, 2004, in North America on October 25, 2004, and in Europe on January 7, 2005. The game arrived on the Wii's Virtual Console in Europe on July 20, 2007, in North America on August 13, 2007, and in Japan on March 4, 2008. Metroid was released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on March 1, 2012. At E3 2010, Nintendo featured Metroid amongst other games from the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System on a tech demo called Classic Games, to be released for the Nintendo 3DS. Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aim√© said \\"not to think of them as remakes\\". Miyamoto said that these classics might be using \\"new features in the games that would take advantage of the 3DS' capabilities\\". These later became the 3D Classics series which did not include Metroid. . =Remake= The game was reimagined as Metroid: Zero Mission with a more developed backstory, enhanced graphics, and the same general game layout. Reception=Critics= Metroid received largely positive reviews from critics and sold relatively well. In Nintendo Power NES retrospective in 1990, Metroid was rated 5/5 for Graphic and Sound, 4.5/5 for Play Control, 5/5 for Challenge and 5/5 for Theme Fun. In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked Metroid as the 11th-best game on its list of the Top 200 Games on a Nintendo video game console. Two years later, the magazine also named Metroid the fifth-best game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in its Best of the Best feature, describing it as a combination of Super Mario Bros.s platforming and The Legend of Zeldas exploration and character upgrades. The game was ranked 44th on Electronic Gaming Monthlys original 100 best games of all time in 1997, Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. dropped to 69th in 2001, but was ranked 11th on its \\"Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time\\" in 2006, which as the name suggests was a list which ranked games based on how much impact they made at the time (whereas EGMs earlier lists ranked games based on lasting appeal, with no consideration given to innovation or influence). Game Informer ranked it 6th best game of all time in 2001 then 7th in 2009, saying that it \\"started the concept of open exploration in games\\". GamesRadar ranked it the fifth best NES game ever made. The staff felt that it had aged after the release of Super Metroid but was \\"fantastic for its time\\". Metroids multiple endings enticed players to race through the game as fast as possible, a method of play commonly known as speedrunning. Entertainment Weekly picked the game as the #18 greatest game available in 1991, saying: \\"The visuals are simplistic, but few games make you think as much as the five-year-old Metroid. Try not to consult Nintendo's hint book, which provides detailed maps of the terrain your hero has to navigate in order to complete his mission.\\"https://ew.com/article/1991/11/22/video-games-guide/ In a retrospective focusing on the entire Metroid series, GameTrailers remarked on the original game's legacy and its effect on the video game industry. They noted that starting with Metroid, search and discovery is what continues to make the franchise popular. The website felt that the combination of detailed sprites, original map designs, and an intimidating musical score \\"generated an unparalleled ambience and atmosphere that trapped the viewer in an almost claustrophobic state\\". They also noted that the Morph Ball, first introduced in Metroid, \\"slammed an undeniable stamp of coolness on the whole experience and the franchise\\", and they enjoyed the end segment after defeating Mother Brain, claiming that the race to escape the planet Zebes was a \\"twist few saw coming\\". The game brought \\"explosive action\\" to the Nintendo Entertainment System and a newfound respect for female protagonists. Noting that Metroid was not the first game to offer an open world, nor was it the first side-view platformer exploration game, and neither was it the first game to allow players to reach new areas using newly acquired items, Gamasutra praised Metroid for being perhaps the first video game to \\"take these different elements and rigorously mold them into a game-ruling structure\\". Reviewing the original NES game, AllGame awarded Metroid with a five stars, their highest rating. The review praised the game over Metroid II: Return of Samus and Super Metroid, stating that \\"Metroid's not just a classic because of its astounding graphics, cinematic sound effects, accurate control and fresh gameplay, but also because of its staying power.\\" Reviewing the Classic NES Series version of the game, GameSpot noted that 18 years after its initial release, Metroid \\"just doesn't measure up to today's action adventure standards\\", giving the game a rating of 5.2 out of 10, for \\"mediocre\\". For the Wii Virtual Console version, IGN commented that the game's presentation, graphics, and sound were basic. However, they were still pleased with Metroids \\"impressive\\" gameplay, rating the game 8.0 out of 10, for \\"great,\\" and giving it an Editor's Choice award. The review stated that the game was \\"still impressive in scope\\" and that the price was \\"a deal for this adventure\\" while criticising the number of times it has been re-released and noting that it takes \\"patience\\" to get past the high initial difficulty curve. In GameSpot's review of the Virtual Console version, they criticized its \\"frustrating room layouts\\" and \\"constantly flickering graphics\\". In particular, the website was disappointed that Nintendo did not make any changes to the game, specifically criticizing the lack of a save feature. Metroids gameplay, focusing on exploration and searching for power-ups to reach new areas, influenced other series, mostly the Castlevania series. The revelation of Samus being a woman was also lauded as innovative, with GameTrailers remarking that this \\"blew the norm of women in pieces, at a time when female video game characters were forced into the role of dutiful queen or kidnapped princess, missile-blasting the way for other characters like Chun-Li [from the Street Fighter series] and Lara Croft [from the Tomb Raider series]\\". To date, Metroid has shipped 2.73 million units worldwide. Music In his book Maestro Mario: How Nintendo Transformed Videogame Music into an Art, videogame scholar Andrew Schartmann notes the possible influence of Jerry Goldsmith's Alien score on Tanaka's music‚Äîa hypothesis supported by Sakamoto's acknowledgement of Alien's influence on the game's development. As Schartmann notes, \\"Much like Metroid, the movie owes some of its tensest moments to silence.\\"Schartmann, Andrew. Maestro Mario: How Nintendo Transformed Videogame Music into an Art . New York: Thought Catalog, 2013. Schartmann further argues that Tanaka's emphasis on silence was revolutionary to videogame composition: This view is echoed by GameSpot's History of Metroid, which notes how the \\"[game's music] superbly evoked the proper feelings of solitude and loneliness one would expect while infiltrating a hostile alien planet alone.\\" NotesReferencesFurther reading * (Details the internal reception of the game's music)  External links  * Metroid at the Metroid Database 1986 video games Famicom Disk System games Game Boy Advance games Metroid games Metroidvania games Nintendo arcade games Nintendo Entertainment System games Nintendo games Nintendo Research & Development 1 games PlayChoice-10 games Single-player video games Video games featuring female protagonists Virtual Console games Virtual Console games for Wii U Video games developed in Japan Video games directed by Satoru Okada Video games produced by Gunpei Yokoi Video games scored by Hirokazu Tanaka Video games set in the 21st century Video games set on fictional planets Nintendo Switch Online NES games ","title":"Metroid (video game)"},{"id":"18597993","text":"Unicorn mantis is a common name for several species of praying mantis across different genera with horn-like protrusions on their heads including: *Phthersigena unicornis (Timor unicorn mantis) *Phyllovates chlorophaea (Texas unicorn mantis, Mexican unicorn mantis) *Pseudovates arizonae (Arizona unicorn mantis) *Zoolea (Paraguay unicorn mantis, etc.) See also *List of mantis genera and species Animal common name disambiguation pages ","title":"Unicorn mantis"},{"id":"18597999","text":"Thomas Leonard \\"Tommy\\" Pardoe (14 April 1911 - 7 December 1992) was an English boxer who competed for Great Britain in the 1932 Summer Olympics.

At the 1930 Empire Games he won the silver medal in the flyweight class after losing the final to Jacob Smith. Tommy Pardoe was born on 14 April 1911 and lived at 8 Church Walk, Ward End Birmingham, one of fifteen children. He became Amateur Flyweight Champion of Great Britain (ABAE) on 20 March 1929, also winning the title on a further five occasions. He fought in the 1932 summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles and finished fourth. In boxing, if one of the semi-final losers is knocked out, he can't box again for a certain time period as a safety precaution, and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to take away his chance at a bronze medal just because his semi-final opponent was so much better than the others, in all other cases the losing semi-finalists both get a bronze in Olympics and other games because, there are no qualifying events before the main events. Pardoe competed for England and finished second in the 1930 British Empire Games Flyweight class after losing the final to Jacob Smith. He turned professional and on 11 December 1933 won his first fight with Bert Kirby, whom he again defeated on 12 March 1934 in the British (Southern Area) Flyweight Title. On 11 June 1934, he beat Joe Mendiola and then fought Benny Lynch 15 April 1935. He put up a tremendous fight against Lynch in an eliminator for British Flyweight title, winning five of the last six rounds, but bearing in mind Lynch‚Äôs superior experience (82 professional fights), he was knocked out in the fourteenth round.

The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used. The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. History The Roman cookbook of Apicius (4th century) has a recipe for deep-fried chicken called Pullum Frontonianum. Walter M. Hill, De Re Coquinaria of Apicius (1936), p. 153. Apparently the recipe was named after a certain Frontone who lived in the time of Septimius Severus (2nd century). The American English expression \\"fried chicken\\" is first recorded in the 1830s, and frequently appears in American cookbooks of the 1860s and 1870s.etymonline.com; The United States Cook Book: A Complete Manual for Ladies, Housekeepers and Cook (1865), p. 104. Marion Harland, Common Sense in the Household: A Manual of Practical Housewifery (1874), p. 90. The origin of fried chicken in the southern states of America has been traced to precedents in Scottish quoted at . and West African cuisine.Worral, Simon (December 21, 2014) \\"The Surprising Ways That Chickens Changed the World\\" . National Geographic: \\"When slaves were brought here from West Africa, they came with a deep knowledge of the chicken, because in West Africa the chicken was a common farm animal and also a very sacred animal. The knowledge that African- Americans brought served them very well, because white plantation owners for the most part didn't care much about chicken. In colonial times there were so many other things to eat that chicken was not high on the list.\\" Scottish fried chicken was cooked in fat (though unseasoned) while West African fried chicken was seasoned (but battered and cooked in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and African seasoning techniques were used in the American South by African slaves. Fried chicken provided some means of independent economy for enslaved and segregated African-American women, who became noted sellers of poultry (live or cooked) as early as the 1730s. Because of this and the expensive nature of the ingredients, it was, despite popular belief, a rare dish in the African-American community reserved (as in Africa) for special occasions. Homemade lard made from pig fat After the development of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and in a relatively short period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic and caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken. When it was introduced to the American South, fried chicken became a common staple. Later, as the slave trade led to Africans being brought to work on southern plantations, the slaves who became cooks incorporated seasonings and spices that were absent in traditional Scottish cuisine, enriching the flavor.History of Fried Chicken through the Ages .

Since most slaves were unable to raise expensive meats, but generally allowed to keep chickens, frying chicken on special occasions continued in the African American communities of the South. After the abolition of slavery, it gradually passed into common use as a general Southern dish. Since fried chicken traveled well in hot weather before refrigeration was commonplace, it gained further favor in the periods of American history when segregation closed off most restaurants to the black population. Fried chicken continues to be among this region's top choices for \\"Sunday dinner\\". Holidays such as Independence Day and other gatherings often feature this dish.History of Fried Chicken : I Am Welcoming You to Kik Culinary Corner and History of Some Story & Experience .

Since the American Civil War, traditional slave foods like fried chicken, watermelon, and chitterlings have suffered a strong association with African-American stereotypes and blackface minstrelsy. This was commercialized for the first half of the 20th century by restaurants like Sambo's and Coon Chicken Inn, which selected exaggerated depictions of blacks as mascots, implying quality by their association with the stereotype. Although also being acknowledged positively as \\"soul food\\" today, the affinity that African-American culture has for fried chicken has been considered a delicate, often pejorative issue. While the perception of fried chicken as an ethnic dish has been fading for several decades, with the ubiquity of fried chicken dishes in the US, it persists as a racial stereotype. Before the industrialization of chicken production, and the creation of broiler breeds of chicken, only young spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying, making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool and dry, and then fried. Description Paschal's fried chicken, Atlanta, Georgia Fried chicken has been described as being \\"crunchy\\" and \\"juicy\\", as well as \\"crispy\\". In addition, the dish has also been called \\"spicy\\" and \\"salty\\". Occasionally, fried chicken is also topped with a chili like paprika, or hot sauce to give it a spicy taste. This is especially common in fast food restaurant chains such as KFC. The dish is traditionally served with mashed potatoes, gravy, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, corn and/or biscuits. The dish is renowned for being greasy, especially when coming from fast food outlets. It has even been reported that some of those who enjoy eating the food limit themselves to eating it only a certain number of times a year, to keep their fat intake reasonably low. Out of the various parts of the animal used in fried chicken, the wings generally tend to contain the most fat, with almost of fat for every . However, the average whole fried chicken contains only around 12% fat, or per every . As well as this, of fried chicken generally contains around 240 calories of energy. Preparation alt=Chicken wings being fried in a pan filled with corn oil Generally, chickens are not fried whole. Instead, the chicken is divided into its constituent pieces. The white meat sections are the breast and the wings from the front of the chicken, while the dark meat sections are the thighs and legs or \\"drumsticks\\" from the rear of the chicken. The breast is typically split into two pieces, and the back is usually discarded. Chicken fingers, which are boneless pieces of chicken breast cut into long strips, are also commonly used. To prepare the chicken pieces for frying, they are typically coated in a flour-based batter that may contain eggs or milk, or they may be dredged in flour or breadcrumbs. Seasonings such as salt, black pepper, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, or onion powder can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or dipping in buttermilk, the acidity of which acts as a meat tenderizer. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. Traditionally, lard is used to fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, soybean oil, or other vegetable oils are also frequently used. The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use.What is Southern Fried Chicken? . Wisegeek.com. Retrieved on January 30, 2012. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting. Fried chicken Pan frying (or shallow frying) requires a frying pan of sturdy construction and a source of fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces have been added to the hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy. Deep frying requires a deep fryer or other device in which the chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it at a very high temperature. The pieces are prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process. Broasting uses a pressure cooker to accelerate the process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in a pressure cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid is placed on the pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.Fried Chicken Recipes .

The derivative phrases \\"country fried\\" and \\"chicken fried\\" often refer to other foods prepared in the manner of fried chicken. Usually, this means a boneless, tenderized piece of meat that has been floured or battered and cooked in any of the methods described. Chicken fried steak is a common dish of that variety. Such dishes are often served with gravy. Variants * Barberton chicken, also known as Serbian Fried Chicken, is a version created by Serbian immigrants in Barberton, Ohio, that has been popularized throughout that state. * Chicken Maryland is a form of pan-fried chicken, often marinated in buttermilk, served with cream gravy and native to the state of Maryland. The recipe spread beyond the United States to the haute cuisine of Auguste Escoffier and, after heavy modification, found a place in the cuisines of Britain and Australia. The dish is made when a pan of chicken pieces and fat, as for pan frying, is placed in the oven to cook, for a majority of the overall cooking time, basically \\"fried in the oven\\". * Popcorn chicken, also known as chicken bites or other similar terms, are small morsels of boneless chicken, battered and fried, resulting in small pieces that resemble popcorn. * Chicken and waffles, is a combination platter of foods traditionally served at breakfast and dinner in one meal, common to soul food restaurants in the American South and beyond. * Hot chicken, common in the Nashville, Tennessee area, is a pan-fried variant coated with lard and cayenne pepper paste. Racial stereotype In the United States, fried chicken has stereotypically been associated with African-Americans. The reasons for this are various. Chicken dishes were popular among slaves before the Civil War, as chickens were generally the only animals slaves were allowed to raise on their own. Minstrel shows and the film The Birth of a Nation led to a prevalent stereotype associating African-Americans with fried chicken. On two occasions the golfer Tiger Woods has been the target of remarks regarding fried chicken. The first occurred in 1997 when golfer Fuzzy Zoeller said that Woods should avoid choosing fried chicken for the Masters champions' dinner the following year; the second when golfer Sergio Garc√≠a was asked in a press conference in 2013 whether he would invite Woods to dinner during the U.S. Open to settle their ongoing feud. Garc√≠a, a Spaniard who was unaware of the existence of this stereotype in American society, committed a gaffe saying: \\"We will have him round every night . . . We will serve fried chicken\\", which Woods said was \\"wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate\\". Both Zoeller and Garc√≠a subsequently apologized to Woods. In 2011, a Beijing restaurant named \\"Obama Fried Chicken\\" opened in reference to then President Barack Obama. It faced legal action from KFC and was renamed soon afterwards. At a dinner during Black History Month, an NBC chef, Leslie Calhoun, served fried chicken. The drummer of the Roots, Questlove, was angered by this and thought it both offensive and ignorant. In 2012, Burger King released a commercial which featured Mary J. Blige singing about a crispy chicken wrap. The advertisement was controversial due to the racial stereotypes surrounding fried chicken, and prompted Burger King to remove it from YouTube and Blige to apologize for appearing in it. In 2019, Will Hurd, an African-American Congressman, appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher. There, he said that while he was in the CIA he \\"was the dude in the back alleys at four o'clock in the morning collecting intelligence on threats to the homeland.\\" Bill Maher responded by saying \\"That's where you'd collect it, huh? Wow. By the Popeyes Chicken?\\" Maher was accused of being racist for making that remark. See also * John T.

Life Celina Szymanowska, daughter of Mickiewicz's late friend the pianist Maria Agata Szymanowska, married the 14-years-older Adam Mickiewicz in Paris on 22 July 1834. The couple had six children: daughters Maria and Helena; and four sons, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Mickiewicz (1838‚Äì1926), J√≥zef Mickiewicz (1850‚Äì1938), Aleksander Mickiewicz and Jan Mickiewicz. Celina roused the dislike of other Polish √©migr√©s, including the Romantic poet Zygmunt Krasi≈Ñski. She was accused of extravagance, poor cooking skills, a desire to dominate her husband, and mental instability. In 1838 Celina declared herself a prophet, an incarnation of the Mother of God, and redeemer of Poland, of Polish √©migr√©s and of the Jews. She also claimed to possess a power to heal, which she said she had successfully applied to the gravely ill Adolf Zaleski. For a time, Adam Mickiewicz cared for his wife himself; but marital discord and Celina's mental illness drove him to attempt suicide on 17 or 18 December 1838 by jumping out a window. When he found that Celina's mental state was getting worse, Mickiewicz had her committed to a mental hospital at Vanves, where she underwent sleep-deprivation, cold-water and mental-shock therapies. Celina was freed from the hospital by Andrzej Towia≈Ñski, who claimed to have miraculously cured her. She believed his assurances that she had regained her mental health, and to the end of her life she remained under his influence and that of the Circle of God's Cause (Ko≈Ço Sprawy Bo≈ºej). Upon her death in 1855, she was interred at Paris' P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery. Exhumed, her remains were transferred to Les Champeaux Cemetery at Montmorency. The Mickiewicz family tomb exists there to the present day. After Celina's death and the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1855, Adam Mickiewicz left his under-age children in Paris and went to Istanbul, Turkey, to organize legions to fight for Poland's independence from the Russian Empire. At Istanbul he contracted cholera and died. References *Jadwiga Maurer, \\"Celina Szymanowska as a Frankist,\\" The Polish Review, vol.

Published in 2006 by Knopf/Anchor, the novel tells the story of the Biafran War through the perspective of the characters Olanna, Ugwu, and Richard. Plot The novel takes place in Nigeria prior to and during the Nigerian Civil War (1967‚Äì70). The effect of the war is shown through the relationships of five people's lives including the twin daughters of an influential businessman, a professor, a British citizen, and a Nigerian houseboy. After Biafra's declaration of secession, the lives of the main characters drastically change and are torn apart by the brutality of the civil war and decisions in their personal lives. The book jumps between events that took place during the early and late 1960s, when the war took place, and extends until the end of the war. In the early 1960s, the main characters are introduced: Ugwu, a 13-year-old village boy who moves in with Odenigbo, to work as his houseboy. Odenigbo frequently entertains intellectuals to discuss the political turmoil in Nigeria. Life changes for Ugwu when Odenigbo's girlfriend, Olanna, moves in with them. Ugwu forms a strong bond with both of them, and is a very loyal houseboy. Olanna has a twin sister, Kainene, a woman with a dry sense of humor, tired by the pompous company she runs for her father. Her lover Richard is an English writer who goes to Nigeria to explore Igbo-Ukwu art. Jumping four years ahead, trouble is brewing between the Hausa and the Igbo people and hundreds of people die in massacres, including Olanna's beloved auntie and uncle. A new republic, called Biafra, is created by the Igbo. As a result of the conflict, Olanna, Odenigbo, their infant daughter, whom they refer to only as \\"Baby\\", and Ugwu are forced to flee Nsukka, which is the university town and the major intellectual hub of the new nation. They finally end up in the refugee town of Umuahia, where they suffer and struggle due to food shortages, the constant air raids and the environment of paranoia. There are also allusions to a conflict between Olanna and Kainene, Richard and Kainene and between Olanna and Odenigbo. When the novel jumps back to the early 1960s, we learn that Odenigbo has slept with a village girl, Amala, who then has his baby. Olanna is furious at his betrayal, and sleeps with Richard in a moment of liberation. She goes back to Odenigbo and when they later learn that Amala refused to keep her newborn daughter, Olanna decides that they would keep her. During the war, Olanna, Odenigbo, Baby, and Ugwu live with Kainene and Richard, where Kainene was running a refugee camp. Their situation is hopeless, as they have no food nor medicine. Kainene decides to trade across enemy lines, but does not return, even after the end of the war a few weeks later. The book ends ambiguously, with the reader not knowing if Kainene lives. Characters Ugwu ‚Äì The novel starts and ends with Ugwu. He is a village boy from Opi who later becomes a servant in Odenigbo's house. Under Odenigbo and Olanna's guidance, Ugwu is able to continue his education and his literary skills progress throughout the novel. He tries to maintain contact with his mother and sister, Anulika, back in his home village, and is constantly looking out for his mother's health and wellbeing. His free time is often dominated by his love interests, which include Nnesinachi, Eberechi, and Chinyere. His life is violently interrupted when he is forcibly conscripted into the Biafran Army. There, he witnesses and participates in gruesome battles and a rape. Odenigbo ‚Äì Odenigbo starts the novel as Professor of Mathematics at Nsukka University. His strong opinions result in some characters labeling him as a ‚Äúrevolutionary.‚Äù He favors socialism and tribalism to capitalism and Pan-Africanism or nationalism. After the war forces him to vacate his position at Nsukka University, Odenigbo becomes active in the war cause under Manpower Directorate . His personal life is dominated by his relationship and later marriage to Olanna. He is the father of Baby, though Amala, not Olanna, is Baby's biological mother. Odenigbo also has a strong, albeit turbulent, relationship with his mother. ‚ÄúMama‚Äù affects his relationship with Olanna, and Mama's death starts Odenigbo on a dark path of alcoholism and depression. Olanna ‚Äì Olanna is one of three characters through which the novel is told. She is the daughter of Chief Ozobia and twin of Kainene. Olanna was raised in Nigeria, and later attended university in the United Kingdom. She is described as ‚Äúillogically beautiful,‚Äù and her appearance often dictates how others treat her. For example, her parents try to offer sex with her as a bribe to help secure business deals. Consequently, her connection with her parents is weak and she gravitates towards her Aunt Ifeka and Uncle Mbaezi in Kano. Mohammed is her ex-boyfriend and Odenigbo is her husband, and she is the adopted mother of Baby. Professionally, she is a Professor of Sociology at Nsukka University before the war begins. She later works as a school teacher in Umuahia and finally helps her sister care for refugees in Orlu. Kainene ‚Äì Kainene, Olanna's twin, seems to be at first very different from Olanna.

However, after she witnesses the war's cruelty, she changes completely as a character and instead of running her father's business, she runs a refugee camp. She remains fearless and in the end decides to trade with the enemy, putting her life at risk. Richard Churchill ‚Äì Richard is an English writer who comes to Nigeria to explore Igbo-Ukwu art.

Richard is glad to witness Biafra's birth, thinking it would actually make him Biafran. He starts writing a book about the war, but soon realizes that it is not his story to tell. Adichie has said in an interview that the idea of Richard came from Frederick Forsyth, a staunch supporter of Biafra: ‚ÄúRichard isn‚Äôt at all like him, of course, but just the sense of an Englishman who became more Biafran than Biafrans themselves, was really an idea that came from him, Forsyth.‚Äù http://www.themorningnews.org/article/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie Ugwu's aunty ‚Äì Cleaner at Nsukka University, she introduces Ugwu to Master Odenigbo.

The war broke out due to political and ethnic struggles, partly caused by the numerous attempts of the southeastern provinces of Nigeria to secede and form the Republic of Biafra. Political conflict between the Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa and Fulani people erupted into two deadly military coups. The Igbo tried to break away from Nigeria to become the Republic of Biafra, but were met with little support. From 1968 onward, the war fell into a form of deadlock, with Nigerian forces unable to make significant advances into the remaining areas of Biafran control. Nigeria cut off humanitarian aid to Biafra, resulting in hundreds of thousands of civilians dying from starvation and disease. Many lives and resources were lost during the war, including Adichie's grandfathers; and even today there are still tensions between the different ethnic and religious groups of Nigeria. The story in Half of a Yellow Sun centres on the war. Adichie grew up in the aftermath of the war: \\"The need to write about it came from growing up in its shadow. This thing that I didn't quite understand was my legacy. It hovered over everything\\". She has stated she believes that many of the issues that caused the war remain today. She further commented that the war is talked about \\"in uninformed and unimaginative ways\\", and that the war is as important to the Igbo people her book features today as it was then. Because none of the major political events were changed in the book, Adichie said that the book contained \\"emotional truth\\", and that the book showed the war had a significant impact upon the people of Nigeria. Politics and identity in post- colonial Africa The social gatherings at Odenigbo's house are full of debates on Africa's political future. Here, the usefulness of various forms of African governance are discussed amongst the Nigerian intelligentsia. One particularly noteworthy debate involves Odenigbo defending the tribe as the ideal unit for African, as other characters stress the need for pan-Africanism or nationalism. He is quoted as proclaiming: ‚Äúthe only authentic identity for the African is the tribe...I am Nigerian because a white man created Nigeria and gave me that identity. I am black because the white man constructed black to be as different as possible from his white. But I was Igbo before the white man came.‚Äù Role of Westerners in post-colonial Africa Although there is a clear accusation of Western influence on Biafran war (mostly England's involvement in the war), a more subtle critique is found in Richard's character. Richard, although with good intentions, tries too hard to be part of first Nigeria, and later Biafra. His fascination with the culture and his wish to be part of Biafra leads to him speaking for Biafrans by attempting to write two novels, one about the art, and the second one about the Biafran war. Richard is unable to complete either, and concludes that these are not his stories to tell. However, he is effective when he writes about the war for the Western press, which actually helps Biafra's cause. Adichie herself has said in an interview, that ‚Äúmaybe [Richard‚Äôs character] is my subtle way of slipping in my politics that maybe it‚Äôs time that Africans wrote about Africa.‚Äù Relevance of academia in everyday life Many of the main characters in Half of a Yellow Sun are professors, including Olanna and Odenigbo. Odenigbo regularly hosts fellow professors from Nsukka University for political discussions on the weekends. Over the course of the novel, Half of a Yellow Sun seems to criticize both these professors and their opinions. It does this by juxtaposing the high-minded political opinions of Odenigbo and his companions from the ‚ÄúEarly Sixties‚Äù sections against the political realities of the ‚ÄúLate Sixties‚Äù sections. The novel also uses the same professors from the ‚ÄúEarly Sixties‚Äù sections and puts them in the ‚ÄúLate Sixties‚Äù sections. Also, Kainene's business mind helps her successfully run a refugee camp, whereas Olanna and Odenigbo seem ineffectual. Adichie seems to emphasize the reality of action over the ephemeral nature of opinion. Rule of Western journalism Half of a Yellow Sun is heavily critical of the Western media's coverage of the Biafran War. The rule of Western journalism is obvious when Richard meets with the foreign journalists: \\"Richard exhaled. It was like somebody sprinkling pepper on his wound: Thousands of Biafrans were dead, and this man wanted to know if there was anything new about one dead white man. Richard would write about this, the rule of Western journalism: One hundred dead black people equal one dead white person.\\" Since it is clear that white journalists have a greater influence, Madu asks Richard to write about the war for the Western press: ‚ÄúThey will take what you write more seriously because you are white. If you really want to contribute, this is the way that you can. The world has to know the truth of what is happening, because they simply cannot remain silent while we die.‚Äù Women empowerment Although Half of a Yellow Sun does not have the conflict between a woman and patriarchy typical of feminist novels, it does show the agency of women. In one of the pivotal moments, Olanna is disappointed by Odenigbo's betrayal and goes to Kano to seek comfort from her family there. Aunty Ifeka says: ‚ÄúYou must never behave as if your life belongs to a man. Your life belongs to you and you alone.‚Äù Later on, even after forgiving Odenigbo, she confronts him about his betrayal and does not accept him justifying his actions by blaming his mother. On the other hand, when Olanna's father cheats on her mother, Olanna's mother does not confront him about it. She only asks Olanna to tell her father to do it more subtly. Marriage Marriage is a recurrent theme in Half of a Yellow Sun. For the most part of the novel, Olanna and Kainene both live with men without it being question of marriage. Olanna refuses to get married many times at first, fearing that marriage would ‚Äúflatten [their bond] to a prosaic partnership.\\" It is only during the war, when Odenigbo is invited to a town meeting in Abba and Olanna is not, that they talk again about marriage. Olanna accepts, but the wedding is done hastily and is interrupted by an air raid. Although Richard never asks Kainene to marry him, he does mention his wish for her to be his wife many times. Arize who is poor and uneducated, admires Olanna for postponing marriage but waits eagerly for a husband herself: ‚ÄúIt is only women that know too much Book like you who can say that, Sister. If people like me who don‚Äôt know book wait too long, we will expire.‚Äù Adichie seems to be saying that marriage is a pragmatic choice and women who don't need to get married might chose not to even when their boyfriends are willing. Reception Half of a Yellow Sun received the 2007 Orange Prize for Fiction. The award is given annually for the best original full-length novel written by a woman in English; Adichie's prize amounted to ¬£30,000. The novel was well received by critics and included in the New York Times‚Ä≤s \\"100 Most Notable Books of the Year\\". In a review for The Seattle Times, Mary Brennan called the book \\"a sweeping story that provides both a harrowing history lesson and an engagingly human narrative\\". The New York Times had a more mixed review of the book, noting that \\"at times Adichie‚Äôs writing is too straightforward, the novel‚Äôs pace too slack\\" but also that \\"whenever she touches on her favorite themes ‚Äî loyalty and betrayal ‚Äî her prose thrums with life.\\" The Washington Post states: ‚ÄúChimamanda Ngozi Adichie certainly lives up to the hype in her second novel, Half a Yellow Sun. She wowed us with this transcendent tale about war, loyalty, brutality, and love in modern Africa. While painting a searing portrait of the tragedy that took place in Biafra during the 1960s, her story finds its true heart in the intimacy of three ordinary lives buffeted by the winds of fate. Her tale is hauntingly evocative and impossible to forget.‚Äùhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/half-of-a-yellow-sun-chimamanda- ngozi-adichie/1100619131?ean=9781400095209 Rob Nixon's review addressed the historical side of the novel: ‚ÄúHalf of a Yellow Sun takes us inside ordinary lives laid waste by the all too ordinary unraveling of nation states. When an acquaintance of Olanna‚Äôs turns up at a refugee camp, she notices that ‚Äì he was thinner and lankier than she remembered and looked as though he would break in two if he sat down abruptly. ‚Äì It's a measure of Adichie‚Äôs mastery of small things ‚Äì and of the mess the world is in ‚Äì that we see that man arrive, in country after country, again and again and again.‚Äù Writing for The Guardian, Maya Jaggi called the book \\"a landmark novel.\\" A√Øssatou Sidim√© from San Antonio Express-News called Adichie's writing \\"alluring and revelatory, eloquent, prize-winning Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is quickly proving herself to be fearless in the tradition of the great African writers.\\" Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe commented: ‚ÄúWe do not usually associate wisdom with beginners, but here is a new writer endowed with the gift of ancient storytellers,\\" and said about Adichie: \\"She is fearless, or she would not have taken on the intimidating horror of Nigeria's civil war.\\" In 2019, Half of a Yellow Sun was ranked by The Guardian as the 10th best book since 2000. On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Half of a Yellow Sun on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

He co-wrote the screenplay for the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, one of the most influential films of all time.Ranked number 15 by the American Film Institute. Ranked #6 by the British Film Institute. Clarke was a science writer, an avid populariser of space travel, and a futurist of a distinguished ability. He wrote more than a dozen books and many essays for popular magazines. In 1961, he received the Kalinga Prize, a UNESCO award for popularising science. Clarke's science and science-fiction writings earned him the moniker \\"Prophet of the Space Age\\". His science-fiction writings in particular earned him a number of Hugo and Nebula awards, which along with a large readership, made him one of the towering figures of the genre. For many years Clarke, Robert Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov were known as the \\"Big Three\\" of science fiction. Clarke was a lifelong proponent of space travel. In 1934, while still a teenager, he joined the British Interplanetary Society. In 1945, he proposed a satellite communication system using geostationary orbits. He was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946‚Äì1947 and again in 1951‚Äì1953. Clarke emigrated from England to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1956, to pursue his interest in scuba diving. That year, he discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient Koneswaram Temple in Trincomalee. Clarke augmented his popularity in the 1980s, as the host of television shows such as Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World. He lived in Sri Lanka until his death. Clarke was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1989 \\"for services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka\\". He was knighted in 1998 and was awarded Sri Lanka's highest civil honour, Sri Lankabhimanya, in 2005. Biography=Early years= Clarke was born in Minehead, Somerset, England, and grew up in nearby Bishops Lydeard. As a boy, he lived on a farm, where he enjoyed stargazing, fossil collecting, and reading American science-fiction pulp magazines. He received his secondary education at Huish grammar school in Taunton. Some of his early influences included dinosaur cigarette cards, which led to an enthusiasm for fossils starting about 1925. Clarke attributed his interest in science fiction to reading three items: the November 1928 issue of Amazing Stories in 1929; Last and First Men by Olaf Stapledon in 1930; and The Conquest of Space by David Lasser in 1931.Clarke, Arthur C., 1983, Of Sand and Stars: New York Times Book Review, 6March 1983, reprinted in Clarke, Arthur C., 1984, 1984: Spring / A Choice of Futures: New York, Ballantine Books, p. 151‚Äì157. In his teens, he joined the Junior Astronomical Association and contributed to Urania, the society's journal, which was edited in Glasgow by Marion Eadie. At Clarke's request, she added an Astronautics Section, which featured a series of articles written by him on spacecraft and space travel. Clarke also contributed pieces to the Debates and Discussions Corner, a counterblast to an Urania article offering the case against space travel, and also his recollections of the Walt Disney film Fantasia. He moved to London in 1936 and joined the Board of Education as a pensions auditor. Some fellow science- fiction writers and he shared a flat in Gray's Inn Road, where he got the nickname \\"Ego\\" because of his absorption in subjects that interested him, and would later name his office filled with memorabilia as his \\"ego chamber\\". =World War II= During the Second World War from 1941 to 1946, he served in the Royal Air Force as a radar specialist and was involved in the early- warning radar defence system, which contributed to the RAF's success during the Battle of Britain. Clarke spent most of his wartime service working on ground-controlled approach (GCA) radar, as documented in the semiautobiographical Glide Path, his only non-science-fiction novel. Although GCA did not see much practical use during the war, it proved vital to the Berlin Airlift of 1948‚Äì1949 after several years of development. Clarke initially served in the ranks, and was a corporal instructor on radar at No.2 Radio School, RAF Yatesbury in Wiltshire. He was commissioned as a pilot officer (technical branch) on 27 May 1943. He was promoted flying officer on 27 November 1943. He was appointed chief training instructor at RAF Honiley in Warwickshire and was demobilised with the rank of flight lieutenant. =Post- war= After the war, he attained a first-class degree in mathematics and physics from King's College London. After this, he worked as assistant editor at Physics Abstracts. Clarke then served as president of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946 to 1947 and again from 1951 to 1953. Although he was not the originator of the concept of geostationary satellites, one of his most important contributions in this field may be his idea that they would be ideal telecommunications relays. He advanced this idea in a paper privately circulated among the core technical members of the British Interplanetary Society in 1945. The concept was published in Wireless World in October of that year. Clarke also wrote a number of nonfiction books describing the technical details and societal implications of rocketry and space flight. The most notable of these may be Interplanetary Flight: An Introduction to Astronautics (1950), The Exploration of Space (1951), and The Promise of Space (1968). In recognition of these contributions, the geostationary orbit above the equator is officially recognised by the International Astronomical Union as the Clarke Orbit. Following the 1968 release of 2001, Clarke became much in demand as a commentator on science and technology, especially at the time of the Apollo space program. On 20 July 1969, Clarke appeared as a commentator for the CBS News broadcast of the Apollo 11 moon landing. =Sri Lanka and diving= Clarke lived in Sri Lanka from 1956 until his death in 2008, first in Unawatuna on the south coast, and then in Colombo. Initially, his friend Mike Wilson and he travelled around Sri Lanka, diving in the coral waters around the coast with the Beachcombers Club. In 1957, during a dive trip off Trincomalee, Clarke discovered the underwater ruins of a temple, which would subsequently make the region popular with divers. He subsequently described it in his 1957 book The Reefs of Taprobane. This was his second diving book after the 1956 The Coast of Coral. Though Clarke lived mostly in Colombo, he set up a small diving school and a simple dive shop near Trincomalee. He dived often at Hikkaduwa, Trincomalee, and Nilaveli. The Sri Lankan government offered Clarke resident guest status in 1975. He was held in such high esteem that when fellow science-fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein came to visit, the Sri Lanka Air Force provided a helicopter to take them around the country. In the early 1970s, Clarke signed a three-book publishing deal, a record for a science-fiction writer at the time. The first of the three was Rendezvous with Rama in 1973, which won all the main genre awards and spawned sequels that along with the 2001 series formed the backbone of his later career. Marconi International Fellowship Award from Prince Claus of the Netherlands in 1982. In 1986, Clarke was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America. In 1988, he was diagnosed with post-polio syndrome, having originally contracted polio in 1962, and needed to use a wheelchair most of the time thereafter. Clarke was for many years a vice-patron of the British Polio Fellowship. In the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours, Clarke was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) \\"for services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka\\". The same year, he became the first chancellor of the International Space University, serving from 1989 to 2004. He also served as chancellor of Moratuwa University in Sri Lanka from 1979 to 2002. In 1994, Clarke appeared in a science-fiction film; he portrayed himself in the telefilm Without Warning, an American production about an apocalyptic alien first-contact scenario presented in the form of a faux newscast. Clarke also became active in promoting the protection of gorillas and became a patron of the Gorilla Organization, which fights for the preservation of gorillas. When tantalum mining for mobile phone manufacture threatened the gorillas in 2001, he lent his voice to their cause. The dive shop that he set up continues to operate from Trincomalee through the Arthur C Clarke Foundation. =Television series host= In the 1980s and early 1990s, Clarke presented his television programmes Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World, Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers, and Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe. =Personal life= On a trip to Florida in 1953, Clarke met and quickly married Marilyn Mayfield, a 22-year-old American divorcee with a young son. They separated permanently after six months, although the divorce was not finalised until 1964.McAleer, Neil. \\"Arthur C. Clarke: The Authorized Biography\\", Contemporary Books, Chicago, 1992. \\"The marriage was incompatible from the beginning,\\" said Clarke. Clarke never remarried, but was close to a Sri Lankan man, Leslie Ekanayake (13 July 19474July 1977), whom Clarke called his \\"only perfect friend of a lifetime\\" in the dedication to his novel The Fountains of Paradise. Clarke is buried with Ekanayake, who predeceased him by three decades, in Colombo's central cemetery.Wilson, Scott.

In his biography of Stanley Kubrick, John Baxter cites Clarke's homosexuality as a reason why he relocated, due to more tolerant laws with regard to homosexuality in Sri Lanka. In 1998, the Sunday Mirror reported that he paid Sri Lankan boys for sex, leading to the cancellation of plans for Prince Charles to knight him on a visit to the country. The accusation was subsequently found to be baseless by the Sri Lankan police and was retracted by the newspaper. Journalists who enquired of Clarke whether he was gay were told, \\"No, merely mildly cheerful.\\" However, Michael Moorcock wrote: In an interview in the July 1986 issue of Playboy magazine, when asked if he had had a bisexual experience, Clarke stated, \\"Of course. Who hasn't?\\" In his obituary, Clarke's friend Kerry O'Quinn wrote: \\"Yes, Arthur was gay ... As Isaac Asimov once told me, 'I think he simply found he preferred men.' Arthur didn't publicise his sexualitythat wasn't the focus of his lifebut if asked, he was open and honest.\\" Clarke accumulated a vast collection of manuscripts and personal memoirs, maintained by his brother Fred Clarke in Taunton, Somerset, England, and referred to as the \\"Clarkives\\". Clarke said some of his private diaries will not be published until 30 years after his death. When asked why they were sealed, he answered, \\"Well, there might be all sorts of embarrassing things in them.\\" =Knighthood= On 26 May 2000, he was made a Knight Bachelor \\"for services to literature\\" at a ceremony in Colombo. The award of a knighthood had been announced in the 1998 New Year Honours list, but investiture with the award had been delayed, at Clarke's request, because of an accusation by the British tabloid the Sunday Mirror of paying boys for sex. The charge was subsequently found to be baseless by the Sri Lankan police. According to The Daily Telegraph, the Mirror subsequently published an apology, and Clarke chose not to sue for defamation. The Independent reported that a similar story was not published, allegedly because Clarke was a friend of newspaper tycoon Rupert Murdoch. Clarke himself said, \\"I take an extremely dim view of people mucking about with boys,\\" and Rupert Murdoch promised him the reporters responsible would never work in Fleet Street again. Clarke was then duly knighted. =Later years= Clarke at his home in Sri Lanka, 2005 Although he and his home were unharmed by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tsunami, his \\"Arthur C. Clarke Diving School\\" (now called \\"Underwater Safaris\\") at Hikkaduwa near Galle was destroyed. He made humanitarian appeals, and the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation worked towards better disaster notification systems. Because of his post-polio deficits, which limited his ability to travel and gave him halting speech, most of Clarke's communications in his last years were in the form of recorded addresses. In July 2007, he provided a video address for the Robert A. Heinlein Centennial in which he closed his comments with a goodbye to his fans. In September 2007, he provided a video greeting for NASA's Cassini probe's flyby of Iapetus (which plays an important role in the book of 2001: A Space Odyssey). In December 2007 on his 90th birthday, Clarke recorded a video message to his friends and fans bidding them good-bye. Clarke died in Sri Lanka on 19 March 2008 after suffering from respiratory failure, according to Rohan de Silva, one of his aides.Writer Arthur C Clarke dies at 90, BBC News, 18 March 2008Sci-fi guru Arthur C. Clarke dies at 90, NBC News, 18 March 2008 His aide described the cause as respiratory complications and heart failure stemming from post-polio syndrome. Just hours before Clarke's death, a major gamma-ray burst (GRB) reached Earth. Known as GRB 080319B, the burst set a new record as the farthest object that can be seen from Earth with the naked eye. It occurred about 7.5 billion years ago, the light taking that long to reach Earth. Larry Sessions, a science writer for Sky and Telescope magazine blogging on earthsky.org, suggested that the burst be named the \\"Clarke Event\\". American Atheist Magazine wrote of the idea: \\"It would be a fitting tribute to a man who contributed so much, and helped lift our eyes and our minds to a cosmos once thought to be province only of gods.\\" A few days before he died, he had reviewed the manuscript of his final work, The Last Theorem, on which he had collaborated by e-mail with contemporary Frederik Pohl. The book was published after Clarke's death. Clarke was buried alongside Leslie Ekanayake in Colombo in traditional Sri Lankan fashion on 22 March. His younger brother, Fred Clarke, and his Sri Lankan adoptive family were among the thousands in attendance. Science- fiction writer Clarke's novella \\"The Road to the Sea\\" was originally published in Two Complete Science-Adventure Books in 1951 as \\"Seeker of the Sphinx\\". =Beginnings= While Clarke had a few stories published in fanzines, between 1937 and 1945, his first professional sale appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in 1946: \\"Loophole\\" was published in April, while \\"Rescue Party\\", his first sale, was published in May. Along with his writing, Clarke briefly worked as assistant editor of Science Abstracts (1949) before devoting himself in 1951 to full-time writing. Clarke began carving out his reputation as a \\"scientific\\" science-fiction writer with his first science- fiction novel, Against the Fall of Night, published as a novella in 1948. It was very popular and considered ground-breaking work for some of the concepts it contained. Clarke revised and expanded the novella into a full novel, which was published in 1953. Clarke later rewrote and expanded this work a third time to become The City and the Stars in 1956, which rapidly became a definitive must-read in the field. His third science-fiction novel, Childhood's End, was also published in 1953, cementing his popularity. Clarke capped the first phase of his writing career with his sixth novel, A Fall of Moondust, in 1961, which is also an acknowledged classic of the period. During this time, Clarke corresponded with C. S. Lewis in the 1940s and 1950s and they once met in an Oxford pub, the Eastgate, to discuss science fiction and space travel. Clarke voiced great praise for Lewis upon his death, saying the Ransom trilogy was one of the few works of science fiction that should be considered literature. =\\"The Sentinel\\"= Clarke's novelette \\"Jupiter Five\\" was cover-featured on the May 1953 issue of If. In 1948, he wrote \\"The Sentinel\\" for a BBC competition. Though the story was rejected, it changed the course of Clarke's career. Not only was it the basis for 2001: A Space Odyssey, but \\"The Sentinel\\" also introduced a more cosmic element to Clarke's work. Many of Clarke's later works feature a technologically advanced but still-prejudiced mankind being confronted by a superior alien intelligence. In the cases of Childhood's End, and the 2001 series, this encounter produces a conceptual breakthrough that accelerates humanity into the next stage of its evolution. This also applies in the far-distant past (but our future) in The City and the Stars (and its original version, Against the Fall of Night). In Clarke's authorised biography, Neil McAleer writes: \\"many readers and critics still consider Childhood's End Arthur C. Clarke's best novel.\\" But Clarke did not use ESP in any of his later stories, saying, \\"I've always been interested in ESP, and of course, Childhood's End was about that. But I've grown disillusioned, partly because after all this time, they're still arguing about whether these things happen. I suspect that telepathy does happen.\\" A collection of early essays was published in The View from Serendip (1977), which also included one short piece of fiction, \\"When the Twerms Came\\". Clarke also wrote short stories under the pseudonyms of E. G. O'Brien and Charles Willis. Almost all of his short stories can be found in the book The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke (2001). =\\"Big Three\\"= Clarke as depicted in Amazing Stories in 1953 Clarke's novelette \\"The Songs of Distant Earth\\", the cover story for the June 1958 issue of If, was expanded to novel length almost three decades later. For much of the later 20th century, Clarke, Asimov, and Heinlein were informally known as the \\"Big Three\\" of science-fiction writers. Clarke and Heinlein began writing to each other after The Exploration of Space was published in 1951, and first met in person the following year. They remained on cordial terms for many years, including visits in the United States and Sri Lanka. Clarke and Asimov first met in New York City in 1953, and they traded friendly insults and gibes for decades. They established an oral agreement, the \\"Clarke‚ÄìAsimov Treaty\\", that when asked who was better, the two would say Clarke was the better science-fiction writer and Asimov was the better science writer. In 1972, Clarke put the \\"treaty\\" on paper in his dedication to Report on Planet Three and Other Speculations. In 1984, Clarke testified before Congress against the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Later, at the home of Larry Niven in California, a concerned Heinlein attacked Clarke's views on United States foreign and space policy (especially the SDI), vigorously advocating a strong defence posture. Although the two later reconciled formally, they remained distant until Heinlein's death in 1988. =2001 series of novels= 2001: A Space Odyssey, Clarke's most famous work, was extended well beyond the 1968 movie as the Space Odyssey series. In 1982, Clarke wrote a sequel to 2001 titled 2010: Odyssey Two, which was made into a film in 1984. Clarke wrote two further sequels which have not been adapted into motion pictures: 2061: Odyssey Three (published in 1987) and 3001: The Final Odyssey (published in 1997). 2061: Odyssey Three involves a visit to Halley's Comet on its next plunge through the Inner Solar System and a spaceship crash on the Jovian moon Europa. The whereabouts of astronaut Dave Bowman (the \\"Star Child\\"), the artificial intelligence HAL 9000, and the development of native life on Europa, protected by the alien Monolith, are revealed. Finally, in 3001: The Final Odyssey, astronaut Frank Poole's freeze- dried body, found by a spaceship beyond the orbit of Neptune, is revived by advanced medical science. The novel details the threat posed to humanity by the alien monoliths, whose actions are not always as their builders had intended. 2001: A Space Odyssey Clarke's first venture into film was 2001: A Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick and Clarke had met in New York City in 1964 to discuss the possibility of a collaborative film project. As the idea developed, they decided to loosely base the story on Clarke's short story, \\"The Sentinel\\", written in 1948 as an entry in a BBC short-story competition. Originally, Clarke was going to write the screenplay for the film, but Kubrick suggested during one of their brainstorming meetings that before beginning on the actual script, they should let their imaginations soar free by writing a novel first, on which they would base the film. \\"This is more or less the way it worked out, though toward the end, novel and screenplay were being written simultaneously, with feedback in both directions. Thus, I rewrote some sections after seeing the movie rushesa rather expensive method of literary creation, which few other authors can have enjoyed.\\" The novel ended up being published a few months after the release of the movie. Due to the hectic schedule of the film's production, Kubrick and Clarke had difficulty collaborating on the book. Clarke completed a draft of the novel at the end of 1964 with the plan to publish in 1965 in advance of the film's release in 1966. After many delays, the film was released in the spring of 1968, before the book was completed. The book was credited to Clarke alone. Clarke later complained that this had the effect of making the book into a novelisation, and that Kubrick had manipulated circumstances to downplay Clarke's authorship. For these and other reasons, the details of the story differ slightly from the book to the movie. The film contains little explanation for the events taking place. Clarke, though, wrote thorough explanations of \\"cause and effect\\" for the events in the novel. James Randi later recounted that upon seeing the premiere of 2001, Clarke left the theatre at the intermission in tears, after having watched an eleven-minute scene (which did not make it into general release) where an astronaut is doing nothing more than jogging inside the spaceship, which was Kubrick's idea of showing the audience how boring space travels could be. In 1972, Clarke published The Lost Worlds of 2001, which included his accounts of the production, and alternative versions of key scenes. The \\"special edition\\" of the novel A Space Odyssey (released in 1999) contains an introduction by Clarke in which he documents the events leading to the release of the novel and film. 2010: Odyssey Two In 1982, Clarke continued the 2001 epic with a sequel, 2010: Odyssey Two. This novel was also made into a film, 2010, directed by Peter Hyams for release in 1984. Because of the political environment in America in the 1980s, the film presents a Cold War theme, with the looming tensions of nuclear warfare not featured in the novel. The film was not considered to be as revolutionary or artistic as 2001, but the reviews were still positive. Clarke's email correspondence with Hyams was published in 1984.Arthur C. Clarke and Peter Hyams. The Odyssey File. Ballantine Books, 1984. Titled The Odyssey File: The Making of 2010, and co-authored with Hyams, it illustrates his fascination with the then-pioneering medium of email and its use for them to communicate on an almost daily basis at the time of planning and production of the film while living on opposite sides of the world. The book also included Clarke's personal list of the best science- fiction films ever made. Clarke appeared in the film, first as the man feeding the pigeons while Dr. Heywood Floyd is engaged in a conversation in front of the White House. Later, in the hospital scene with David Bowman's mother, an image of the cover of Time portrays Clarke as the American President and Kubrick as the Soviet Premier. =Rendezvous with Rama= Clarke's award- winning novel Rendezvous with Rama (1973) was optioned for filmmaking in the early 21st century but this motion picture was in \\"development hell\\" . In the early 2000s, actor Morgan Freeman expressed his desire to produce a movie based on Rendezvous with Rama. After a drawn-out development process, which Freeman attributed to difficulties in getting financing, it appeared in 2003 that this project might be proceeding, but this was very dubious. The film was to be produced by Freeman's production company, Revelations Entertainment, and David Fincher has been touted on Revelations' Rama web page as far back as 2001 as the film's director. After years of no progress, Fincher stated in an interview in late 2007 (in which he also credited the novel as being influential on the films Alien and Star Trek: The Motion Picture) that he is still attached to helm. Revelations indicated that Stel Pavlou had written the adaptation. In late 2008, Fincher stated the movie is unlikely to be made. \\"It looks like it's not going to happen. There's no script and as you know, Morgan Freeman's not in the best of health right now. We've been trying to do it but it's probably not going to happen.\\" In 2010, though, the film was announced as still planned for future production and both Freeman and Fincher mentioned it as still needing a worthy script. Science writer Clarke published a number of nonfiction books with essays, speeches, addresses, etc. Several of his nonfiction books are composed of chapters that can stand on their own as separate essays. =Space travel= In particular, Clarke was a populariser of the concept of space travel. In 1950, he wrote Interplanetary Flight, a book outlining the basics of space flight for laymen. Later books about space travel included The Exploration of Space (1951), The Challenge of the Spaceship (1959), Voices from the Sky (1965), The Promise of Space (1968, rev. ed. 1970), and Report on Planet Three (1972) along with many others. =Futurism= His books on space travel usually included chapters about other aspects of science and technology, such as computers and bioengineering. He predicted telecommunication satellites (albeit serviced by astronauts in space suits, who would replace the satellite's vacuum tubes as they burned out). His many predictions culminated in 1958 when he began a series of magazine essays which eventually became Profiles of the Future, published in book form in 1962. A timetable up to the year 2100 describes inventions and ideas including such things as a \\"global library\\" for 2005. The same work also contained \\"Clarke's First Law\\" and text that became Clarke's three laws in later editions. In a 1959 essay, Clarke predicted global satellite TV broadcasts that would cross national boundaries indiscriminately and would bring hundreds of channels available anywhere in the world. He also envisioned a \\"personal transceiver, so small and compact that every man carries one\\". He wrote: \\"the time will come when we will be able to call a person anywhere on Earth merely by dialing a number.\\" Such a device would also, in Clarke's vision, include means for global positioning so \\"no one need ever again be lost.\\" Later, in Profiles of the Future, he predicted the advent of such a device taking place in the mid-1980s. ABC interview with Clarke in which he describes a future of ubiquitous computing reminiscent of the modern Internet In a 1974 interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the interviewer asked Clarke how he believed the computer would change the future for the everyday person, and what life would be like in the year 2001. Clarke accurately predicted many things that became reality, including online banking, online shopping, and other now commonplace things. Responding to a question about how the interviewer's son's life would be different, Clarke responded: \\"He will have, in his own house, not a computer as big as this, [points to nearby computer], but at least, a console through which he can talk, through his friendly local computer and get all the information he needs, for his everyday life, like his bank statements, his theatre reservations, all the information you need in the course of living in our complex modern society, this will be in a compact form in his own house ... and he will take it as much for granted as we take the telephone.\\" An extensive selection of Clarke's essays and book chapters (from 1934 to 1998; 110 pieces, 63 of them previously uncollected in his books) can be found in the book Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds! (2000), together with a new introduction and many prefatory notes. Another collection of essays, all previously collected, is By Space Possessed (1993). Clarke's technical papers, together with several essays and extensive autobiographical material, are collected in Ascent to Orbit: A Scientific Autobiography (1984). Geostationary communications satellite Geostationary or Clarke orbit Clarke contributed to the popularity of the idea that geostationary satellites would be ideal telecommunications relays. He first described this in a letter to the editor of Wireless World in February 1945 and elaborated on the concept in a paper titled Extra-Terrestrial RelaysCan Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?, published in Wireless World in October 1945. The geostationary orbit is now sometimes known as the Clarke Orbit or the Clarke Belt in his honour. It is not clear that this article was actually the inspiration for the modern telecommunications satellite. According to John R. Pierce, of Bell Labs, who was involved in the Echo satellite and Telstar projects, he gave a talk upon the subject in 1954 (published in 1955), using ideas that were \\"in the air\\", but was not aware of Clarke's article at the time. In an interview given shortly before his death, Clarke was asked whether he had ever suspected that one day communications satellites would become so important; he replied: \\"I'm often asked why I didn't try to patent the idea of a communications satellite. My answer is always, 'A patent is really a license to be sued.'\\" Though different from Clarke's idea of telecom relay, the idea of communicating via satellites in geostationary orbit itself had been described earlier. For example, the concept of geostationary satellites was described in Hermann Oberth's 1923 book Die Rakete zu den Planetenr√§umen (The Rocket into Interplanetary Space), and then the idea of radio communication by means of those satellites in Herman Potoƒçnik's (written under the pseudonym Hermann Noordung) 1928 book Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraumsder Raketen-Motor (The Problem of Space TravelThe Rocket Motor), sections: Providing for Long Distance Communications and Safety, and (possibly referring to the idea of relaying messages via satellite, but not that three would be optimal) Observing and Researching the Earth's Surface, published in Berlin. Clarke acknowledged the earlier concept in his book Profiles of the Future. Undersea explorer Clarke was an avid scuba diver and a member of the Underwater Explorers Club. In addition to writing, Clarke set up several diving-related ventures with his business partner Mike Wilson. In 1956, while scuba diving, Wilson and Clarke uncovered ruined masonry, architecture, and idol images of the sunken original Koneswaram templeincluding carved columns with flower insignia, and stones in the form of elephant headsspread on the shallow surrounding seabed. Other discoveries included Chola bronzes from the original shrine, and these discoveries were described in Clarke's 1957 book The Reefs of Taprobane. In 1961, while filming off Great Basses Reef, Wilson found a wreck and retrieved silver coins. Plans to dive on the wreck the following year were stopped when Clarke developed paralysis, ultimately diagnosed as polio. A year later, Clarke observed the salvage from the shore and the surface. The ship, ultimately identified as belonging to the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb, yielded fused bags of silver rupees, cannon, and other artefacts, carefully documented, became the basis for The Treasure of the Great Reef. Living in Sri Lanka and learning its history also inspired the backdrop for his novel The Fountains of Paradise in which he described a space elevator. This, he believed, would make rocket-based access to space obsolete, and more than geostationary satellites, would ultimately be his scientific legacy.Personal e-mail from Sir Arthur Clarke to Jerry Stone, Director of the Sir Arthur Clarke Awards, 1November 2006 Views=Religion= Themes of religion and spirituality appear in much of Clarke's writing. He said: \\"Any path to knowledge is a path to Godor Reality, whichever word one prefers to use.\\" He described himself as \\"fascinated by the concept of God\\". J. B. S. Haldane, near the end of his life, suggested in a personal letter to Clarke that Clarke should receive a prize in theology for being one of the few people to write anything new on the subject, and went on to say that if Clarke's writings did not contain multiple contradictory theological views, he might have been a menace. When he entered the Royal Air Force, Clarke insisted that his dog tags be marked \\"pantheist\\" rather than the default, Church of England, and in a 1991 essay entitled \\"Credo\\", described himself as a logical positivist from the age of 10. In 2000, Clarke told the Sri Lankan newspaper, The Island, \\"I don't believe in God or an afterlife,\\" and he identified himself as an atheist. He was honoured as a Humanist Laureate in the International Academy of Humanism. He has also described himself as a \\"crypto- Buddhist\\", insisting Buddhism is not a religion. He displayed little interest about religion early in his life, for example, only discovering a few months after marrying that his wife had strong Presbyterian beliefs. A famous quotation of Clarke's is often cited: \\"One of the great tragedies of mankind is that morality has been hijacked by religion.\\" He was quoted in Popular Science in 2004 as saying of religion: \\"Most malevolent and persistent of all mind viruses. We should get rid of it as quick as we can.\\" In a three-day \\"dialogue on man and his world\\" with Alan Watts, Clarke said he was biased against religion and could not forgive religions for what he perceived as their inability to prevent atrocities and wars over time. In his introduction to the penultimate episode of Mysterious World, entitled \\"Strange Skies\\", Clarke said: \\"I sometimes think that the universe is a machine designed for the perpetual astonishment of astronomers,\\" reflecting the dialogue of the episode, in which he stated this concept more broadly, referring to \\"mankind\\". Near the very end of that same episode, the last segment of which covered the Star of Bethlehem, he said his favourite theory was that it might be a pulsar. Given that pulsars were discovered in the interval between his writing the short story, \\"The Star\\" (1955), and making Mysterious World (1980), and given the more recent discovery of pulsar PSR B1913+16, he said: \\"How romantic, if even now, we can hear the dying voice of a star, which heralded the Christian era.\\" Despite his atheism, themes of deism are a common feature within Clarke's work. Clarke left written instructions for a funeral: \\"Absolutely no religious rites of any kind, relating to any religious faith, should be associated with my funeral.\\" =Politics= Regarding freedom of information Clarke believed, \\"In the struggle for freedom of information, technology, not politics, will be the ultimate decider.\\" Clarke also wrote, \\"It is not easy to see how the more extreme forms of nationalism can long survive when men have seen the Earth in its true perspective as a single small globe against the stars.\\" Clarke opposed claims of sovereignty over space stating \\"There is hopeful symbolism in the fact that flags do not wave in a vacuum.\\" =Technology= Regarding human jobs being replaced by robots, Clarke said: \\"Any teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be!\\" Clarke supported the use of renewable energy, saying: \\"I would like to see us kick our current addiction to oil, and adopt clean energy sources... Climate change has now added a new sense of urgency. Our civilisation depends on energy, but we can't allow oil and coal to slowly bake our planet.\\" =Intelligent life= Clarke believed, \\"The best proof that there's intelligent life in outer space is the fact that it hasn't come here... the fact that we have not yet found the slightest evidence for lifemuch less intelligencebeyond this Earth does not surprise or disappoint me in the least. Our technology must still be laughably primitive; we may well be like jungle savages listening for the throbbing of tom-toms, while the ether around them carries more words per second than they could utter in a lifetime.\\" He also believed, \\"Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.\\" =Paranormal phenomena= Early in his career, Clarke had a fascination with the paranormal and said it was part of the inspiration for his novel Childhood's End. Citing the numerous promising paranormal claims that were shown to be fraudulent, Clarke described his earlier openness to the paranormal having turned to being \\"an almost total sceptic\\" by the time of his 1992 biography. During interviews, both in 1993 and 2004‚Äì2005, he stated that he did not believe in reincarnation, saying there was no mechanism to make it possible, though \\"I'm always paraphrasing J. B. S. Haldane: 'The universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it's stranger than we can imagine.'\\" He described the idea of reincarnation as fascinating, but favoured a finite existence. Clarke was well known for his television series investigating paranormal phenomenaArthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World (1980), Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Power] (1985), and Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe (1994)enough to be parodied in an episode of The Goodies in which his show is cancelled after it is claimed that he does not exist. In Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World, he gives three kinds of \\"mysteries\\": * Mysteries of the First Kind: Something that was once utterly baffling but is now completely understood, e.g. a rainbow. * Mysteries of the Second Kind: Something that is currently not fully understood and can be in the future. * Mysteries of the Third Kind: Something of which we have no understanding.Arthur C Clarke's Mysterious Universe Themes, style, and influences Clarke's work is marked by an optimistic view of science empowering mankind's exploration of the Solar System and the world's oceans. His images of the future often feature a Utopian setting with highly developed technology, ecology, and society, based on the author's ideals. His early published stories usually featured the extrapolation of a technological innovation or scientific breakthrough into the underlying decadence of his own society. A recurring theme in Clarke's works is the notion that the evolution of an intelligent species would eventually make them something close to gods. This was explored in his 1953 novel Childhood's End and briefly touched upon in his novel Imperial Earth. This idea of transcendence through evolution seems to have been influenced by Olaf Stapledon, who wrote a number of books dealing with this theme. Clarke has said of Stapledon's 1930 book Last and First Men that \\"No other book had a greater influence on my life ... [It] and its successor Star Maker (1937) are the twin summits of [Stapledon's] literary career.\\" Clarke was also well known as an admirer of Irish fantasy writer Lord Dunsany, also having corresponded with him until Dunsany's death in 1957. He described Dunsany as \\"one of the greatest writers of the century.\\" He also listed H. G. Wells, Jules Verne, and Edgar Rice Burroughs as influences. Awards, honours, and other recognition Clarke won the 1963 Stuart Ballantine Medal from the Franklin Institute for the concept of satellite communications, and other honours. He won more than a dozen annual literary awards for particular works of science fiction. * In 1956, Clarke won a Hugo Award for his short story, \\"The Star\\". * Clarke won the UNESCO‚ÄìKalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science in 1961. * He won the Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1963. * Shared a 1969 Academy Award nomination with Stanley Kubrick in the category Best Writing, Story and ScreenplayWritten Directly for the Screen for 2001: A Space Odyssey. * The fame of 2001 was enough for the Command Module of the Apollo 13 craft to be named \\"Odyssey\\". * Clarke won the Nebula (1973) for his novella, \\"A Meeting with Medusa\\". * Clarke won both the Nebula (1973) and Hugo (1974) awards for his novel, Rendezvous with Rama. * Clarke won both the Nebula (1979) and Hugo (1980) awards for his novel, The Fountains of Paradise. * In 1982, he won the Marconi Prize for innovation in communications and remote sensing in space. * In 1985 the Science Fiction Writers of America named him its 7th SFWA Grand Master. * In 1986, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering For conception of geosynchronous communications satellites, and for other contributions to the use and understanding of space * In 1988, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Letters) by the University of Bath. * Readers of the British monthly Interzone voted him the all-time second best science fiction author in 1988‚Äì1989. * He received a CBE in 1989, and was knighted in 2000.

Code-named \\"Tube\\", it was the first touchscreen- equipped S60 device by Nokia - essentially it was the first device to run Symbian^1, also known as S60 5th Edition, the touch-specific S60-based platform created by the Symbian Foundation. The touchscreen features tactile feedback (though it does not use Nokia's Haptikos technology).http://www.mobile-review.com/review/nokia-5800-2-en.shtml Review of GSM/UMTS-smartphone Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Nokia 5800 XpressMusic has a 3.2-inch display with a resolution of 640x360 pixels, and has many features standard to the Nokia Nseries, such as GPS, HSDPA and Wi-Fi support.https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/Nokia-5800-XpressMusic- Review_id2093 It was a highly anticipated device in 2008http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/reviews/item/Nokia_5800_Xpress_Music_Review.phphttps://www.slashgear.com/nokia-5800-xpressmusic- gets-hands-on-0521448/ and went on to become a commercial success with 8 million units sold a year after release. It was praised for its supplied stylus and low price, but was viewed negative by critics for its camera and software issues. History stylus302px The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is not the first touchscreen device in Nokia's range. In 2004, the Nokia 7700 was announced, a Nokia Series 90 device that was cancelled before it reached the market. This was followed by the Nokia 7710 which was an upgraded version of the 7700 and became available during 2005. Nokia also produced the UIQ-based Nokia 6708 phone in 2005, but this was not an in-house development and was bought in from Taiwanese manufacturer BenQ. Nokia have also produced a range of Maemo-based Internet tablets which have a touchscreen interface, but are not mobile phones by themselves (one can connect and use a phone via Bluetooth). The 5800 is, however, Nokia's first Symbian S60 touchscreen device. The 16:9 aspect ratio display was the first among mobile phones. It has a compatibility mode for Java applications that are not touchscreen-aware. It works by using part of the screen for displaying the essential buttons required by the program. The 5800 idle screen, featuring the newly redesigned S60 5th Edition, especially designed for touchscreens The launch of the 5800 XpressMusic in January 2009 was followed-up with the release of the Nokia N97 in May and June 2009, followed by the Series 40 based Nokia 6208c in January 2009. The device, as well as the Nokia Music Store, launched in South Africa on 24 April 2009. On the market, the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic would compete with other touchscreen devices such as Sony Ericsson Xperia X1, Sony Ericsson Satio, iPhone 3G, HTC Touch Diamond, LG Renoir, LG Arena (KM900), BlackBerry Storm 9500, Samsung Pixon and Samsung i900 Omnia. In early February 2009 the website Mobile-Review.com, which was initially very enthusiastic about the handset, published its research and concluded that the Nokia 5800 had a design flaw. Specifically, when phones were used on a daily basis, their earpieces, produced for Nokia under contract by a third party, would cease to function in a very short time. Repairs performed under warranty would only temporarily fix the problem. The defect was found to be in the earpiece design. Nokia's public relations department had admitted that the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic contained this design defect. According to Nokia, they switched to another earpiece manufacturer, so all 5800's produced during February 2009 or later should be free from defect, with previously produced earpieces eligible for free warranty repair. New earpiece parts have also been supplied to Nokia service centres and future phone repairs should permanently fix the defect. =Navigation Edition= On 21 August 2009, Nokia announced a new variant named Nokia 5800 Navigation Edition. In addition to the normal Nokia 5800, it has the latest version of Nokia Maps pre-installed. It also comes with a car charger and car kit inside the box because the GPS decreases the battery life. Both the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and the 5800 Navigation Edition, however, have free lifetime navigation, due to the new version of Ovi Maps. The service was available at nokia.com. Marketing A prototype of this handset was seen in the 2008 Batman movie, The Dark Knight and a number of music videos such as Christina Aguilera's \\"Keeps Gettin' Better\\", \\"Womanizer\\" by Britney Spears, Flo Rida's \\"Right Round\\", Pitbull's \\"Shut It Down\\", The Pussycat Dolls' \\"Jai Ho!\\" and \\"Hush Hush\\", Katy Perry's \\"Waking Up in Vegas\\" and Cobra Starship's \\"Good Girls Go Bad\\". The phone has received generally positive reviews, with UK phone magazine Mobile Choice awarding it a full 5 stars in its 7 January 2009 issue. Sales On 23 January 2009, Nokia announced it had shipped the millionth 5800 XpressMusic device, even though it still had not been fully released worldwide.

However, improved overall performance can be observed since firmware version 30. On 13 January 2010, Nokia released a major firmware update, version 40.0.005. The update includes bug fixes, speed improvements and new features. The most visible are kinetic scrolling to all menus (except the main and applications menus) and an improved home screen that was first introduced on the Nokia 5530. This software update also saw the removal of alphanumeric keypad in landscape view during text input, which was replaced by a full QWERTY keyboard. The new home screen provides a contacts carousel, with up to 20 contacts and program shortcuts on screen at the same time. There is a change on option selecting in every menus, but hard to notice; if one selects and holds on that selection, it will be in white, but normal colours when selecting an option is still being red like in v20. On 19 April 2010, firmware version 50.0.005 was released. This new major update brought some new features available in Nokia N97, such as an upgrade to the existing web browser to version 7.2 and full kinetic scrolling and auto-full screen while browsing the web; a new music player with mini-album art in the song list and the album list, initial letter filtering of track titles in the music player while scrolling using the scroll-bar. As a result, the search function was removed from the music player. A new application called Ovi Sync was installed and the Nokia Music Store received a revamped user interface and was renamed to \\"Ovi Music\\". In some regions, Quick Office 4.2.374 is integrated with full free license.

Pharmaceuticals that contain levoamphetamine are currently indicated and prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obesity, and narcolepsy in some countries. Levoamphetamine is the levorotatory stereoisomer of the amphetamine molecule. While pharmaceutical formulations containing enantiopure levoamphetamine are no longer manufactured, levomethamphetamine (levmetamfetamine) is still marketed and sold over-the-counter as a nasal decongestant.  Chemistry  Levoamphetamine is the levorotatory stereoisomer of the amphetamine molecule. Racemic amphetamine contains two optical isomers, dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine.  Formulations = Racemic amphetamine = The first patented amphetamine brand, Benzedrine, was a racemic (i.e., equal parts) mixture of the free bases or sulfate salts of both amphetamine enantiomers (levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine) that was introduced in the United States in 1934 as an inhaler for treating nasal congestion. It was later realized that the amphetamine enantiomers could treat obesity, narcolepsy, and ADHD. Because of the greater central nervous system effect of the dextrorotatory enantiomer (i.e., dextroamphetamine), sold as Dexedrine, prescription of the Benzedrine brand fell and was eventually discontinued. However, in 2012, racemic amphetamine sulfate was reintroduced as the Evekeo brandname. = Adderall = Adderall is an amphetamine pharmaceutical that contains equal amounts (by weight) of four salts: dextroamphetamine sulfate, amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate and amphetamine (D,L)-aspartate monohydrate. This results in a 3.1:1 mixture of dextro- to levo- amphetamine base equivalent. In other words, it contains 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine. = Evekeo = Evekeo is an FDA- approved medication that contains racemic amphetamine sulfate (i.e., 50% levoamphetamine sulfate and 50% dextroamphetamine sulfate). It is approved for the treatment of narcolepsy, ADHD, and exogenous obesity. The orally disintegrating tablets are approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents aged six to 17 years of age. = Others = Products using amphetamine base are now marketed. Dyanavel XR, a liquid suspension form became available in 2015, and contains about 24% levoamphetamine. Adzenys XR, an orally dissolving tablet came to market in 2016 and contains 25% levoamphetamine. Enantiopure levoamphetamine succinate was sold in Hungary between 1952 and 1955 under the brand name Cydril.

Following a car accident, Keenan became penniless and addicted to painkillers, and he eventually hatched the kidnap-for-ransom scheme and enlisted others to help. Keenan, along with Johnny Irwin and Joe Amsler, conspired to kidnap Frank Sinatra, Jr. Keenan had a psychiatric condition in which he heard voices, and felt that his plan was blessed by God; since he intended to eventually pay the money back, he did not think the kidnapping was immoral. After successfully nabbing Sinatra Jr. from the Harrah's Lodge at South Lake Tahoe, Keenan made contact with Frank Sinatra, Sr. to make ransom arrangements. Sinatra initially offered one million dollars, but Keenan demanded significantly less instead, $240,000. Despite the nature of the crime, Keenan felt that he was bringing the Sinatra family closer together and assisting the Sinatras in other intangible ways. Sinatra paid the ransom and the three men released his son. Within days, all three conspirators were apprehended by the FBI. Keenan was sentenced to life plus seventy-five years in prison for his crimes, but only served four and a half years before he was released, because it was determined that he was legally insane at the time of the crime. After his release, Keenan became successful as a real estate developer. The kidnapping was the basis for Stealing Sinatra, a Showtime movie released in 2003 starring David Arquette and William H. Macy. In 2020, Keenan will be played by Grant Gustin in Operation Blue Eyes.https://deadline.com/2020/03/flash-grant-gustin-frank- sinatra-jr-barry-keenan-operation-blue-eyes-joe-mantegna-directing-1202880133/ Keenan was interviewed about the affair by Ira Glass in a February 2002 episode of the WBEZ radio show This American Life.

She served the U.S. Pacific Fleet with her protective anti-submarine nets, and returned home safely after the war. Built in Washington YN-59 was laid down on 16 December 1942 at Everett, Washington, by the Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company; launched on 16 August 1943; sponsored by Miss Marian Swalwell; redesignated AN-40 and named Anaqua on 20 January 1944; and placed in commission on 21 February 1944. World War II service=Service in the frigid North Pacific= After conducting shakedown training in Puget Sound, the net laying ship got underway for Alaska and reached Dutch Harbor on 20 May. She then began her assignment of tending nets in waters off Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. On 16 October, while the ship was hauling net gear from Cold Bay to Dutch Harbor, she encountered a severe storm with high winds. The damage Anaqua sustained was so extensive that she was ordered to return to the United States for availability. The battered vessel arrived at Seattle, Washington, on 20 December and entered drydock at the Lake Washington Shipyard, Kirkland, Washington. Upon completion of the repairs, she got underway on 5 February 1945 for the Naval Net Depot, Tiburon, California. While en route to that port, she encountered a storm off the coast of Oregon. The ship sprung numerous leaks through the main deck and the boat deck. Moreover, several electrical fires broke out and caused considerable damage. Upon her arrival at Tiburon, the ship was sent to the Martinolich Shipyard in San Francisco for repairs to her new damage. =Assigned to the western Pacific= On 11 March, Anaqua again stood out to sea and arrived back at Tiburon safely and took on a load of amphibious gear before sailing for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. During her voyage across the eastern Pacific, the ship experienced several steering engine failures. She reached Pearl Harbor on 26 March, unloaded her net gear, and entered a drydock at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard where, in addition to repair of her steering system, her hull was re- caulked to eliminate persistent leaks. Anaqua resumed operations late in May, took on a cargo, and, on 25 May, sailed for the Mariana Islands. After a brief stop en route at Eniwetok, the net tender reached Guam on 16 June, discharged her cargo, and then proceeded to Tinian to lay gasoline tanker moorings. She completed this job on 22 June and sailed on to Ulithi. She arrived there on the 26th and spent the next four months in the lagoon of that atoll maintaining anti-torpedo nets in conjunction with five other net tenders. This duty was interrupted briefly by a trip to Yap Island following the surrender of Japan to load Japanese ordnance gear for transportation back to Ulithi. =End-of-war operations= Following her return to the atoll, Anaqua assisted in closing down the large fleet anchorage at Ulithi. The vessel helped remove of anti-torpedo net. This salvage work was completed by 17 October, when she headed home with a barge in tow. The ship paused at Saipan to unload nets being transported by the barge and then proceeded to Hawaii. During this passage, rough seas and inclement weather slowed her progress, and Anaqua headed for Midway Islands to refuel. The vessel finally reached Pearl Harbor on 12 November. The net tender left Hawaii on the 16th and reached San Diego, California, on 25 November. Shortly thereafter, she sailed to San Pedro, California, where preparations to deactivate the ship began. Post-war decommissioning Anaqua was decommissioned at San Pedro on 7 February 1946, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 February 1946. The ship was sold on 6 March 1946 to Mr. Robert J. Heffner, Santa Ana, California.

It is a close relative of the desert locust, which is in the same genus. This grasshopper is native to southern North America including Mexico and the southwestern United States from California to Texas. Can also be found in parts of mid atlantic states. Recently found on Long Island New York. It is also present in parts of Central America. It lives in many habitats including desert, woodland, and lower elevation mountainous areas. It is a large grasshopper, reaching lengths of 4 to 7 centimeters. It is mostly brown and gray spotted or patched in cryptic coloration. This species is known as a pest on ornamental plants and many types of crop plants. Hawaiian population It is a troublesome invasive species in Hawaii. This grasshopper is usually solitary, but it has been known to swarm as locusts. A particularly destructive swarming event occurred on the Hawaiian island of Nihoa in 2004, wiping out some 90% of the vegetation on the island.Lockwood, J. A. & A. V. Latchininsky. (2008). Confessions of a Hit Man. Conservation Magazine 9:3. It was probably introduced to Hawaii several decades ago and then spread through the archipelago by flying; it has the ability to fly at least 300 miles across ocean. Life cycle The grasshopper becomes sexually mature at 3 to 4 months of age. Any stage of its life cycle can be seen at any time of the year, but the adult is less active during the winter and fall. Mating usually occurs on warm nights in summer, and often around bright lights.

During his career, and continuing after his retirement in 1989, he published just over a hundred scientific papers and held administrative posts in government, academic and corporate institutions. Werner graduated from the University of Vienna Medical School in 1945, and continued studies in mathematics, theoretical physics, and later Psychoanalysis. He joined the World Health Organization (WHO) and served in Calcutta, India and Sao Paulo, Brazil. He worked at Cornell Medical College and Johns Hopkins University with Vernon Mountcastle. He was instrumental in introducing the neuropharmacological use of Succinylcholine. Werner became Chairman of the Pharmacology Department, and later Dean of the Medical School, at the University of Pittsburgh. In 1984, Werner was awarded the Alexander von Humboldt Prize to study temporal signal correlations in the brain in a collaboration with Heribert Reitboeck at Philipps University of Marburg / Germany. Werner also served in the Veterans Administration (VA) in Pittsburgh, and later was a consultant to Motorola. As a member of the National Institute of Health (NIH), he was involved in the early development of the prototype for the personal computer during the LINC project. At the University of Pittsburgh, he helped develop an early AI-driven medical expert system - the PROPHET system. He had a long-standing interest in the theoretical grounding of brain-related dynamical systems. After encountering the constructivist concepts of Humberto Maturana, Werner moved away from representationalism as a way to explain the nature of how brain and mind enable knowledge of reality. Like Walter Freeman and the late Francisco Varela, Werner espoused dynamical systems theory in place of representationalism. Vision neuroscientist J. Anthony Movshon of New York University credited Werner and Vernon Mountcastle with introducing Alan Turing's statistical approach to making decisions into neuroscience in the 1960s. Dr. Werner was an adjunct professor with the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Werner died on March 26, 2012 at the age of 90. > The origin and current use of the concepts of computation, representation > and information in Neuroscience are examined and conceptual flaws are > identified which vitiate their usefulness for addressing the problem of the > neural basis of Cognition and Consciousness.

In 1941, he began his academic career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, becoming an assistant professor the following year. From 1943 to 1945 he served in the United States Army as a war correspondent. After the war, in 1945 he returned to MIT and in 1948 was made an associate professor. In that year, he was married. In 1953, he published an authoritative edition of Galileo Galilei's Dialogue on the Great World Systems. In 1954, he became a full Professor of the History of Science in the School of Humanities in 1954. His Galileo project led him to write, and to publish in 1955, The Crime of Galileo. In 1969, he published his book Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time with Dr. Hertha von Dechend. This book focused on the understanding of the connection between the mythological stories of Pharaonic Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Christianity, etc. and ancient observations pertaining to the stars, planets, and, most notably, the 26,000 year precession of the equinoxes.

J. Cronin's 1935 novella Country Doctor, the storylines centred on a general medical practice in the fictional Scottish town of Tannochbrae during the late 1920s. Cronin was the primary writer for the show between 1962 and 1964.  Characters  The main characters were Dr. Finlay, the junior partner in the practice, played by Bill Simpson, Dr. Cameron, the craggy senior partner, played by Andrew Cruickshank and Janet, their unflappable housekeeper and receptionist at Arden House, played by Barbara Mullen. Other recurrent characters included Dr. Snoddie, Finlay's crusty detractor and Janet's admirer, played by Eric Woodburn and gossipy Mistress Niven (the district nurse whose formal title was mistress midwife), played by Effie Morrison.  Cast  *Bill Simpson as Dr. Alan Finlay *Andrew Cruickshank as Dr. Angus Cameron *Barbara Mullen as Janet MacPherson *Eric Woodburn as Dr. Alexander Snoddie *Effie Morrison as Mistress Niven [Her formal title: mistress midwife] *Neil Wilson as Sgt.

It was the ducks and swans on that loch that formed part of the opening sequence of the programme. The preceding shot is of the Red Bridge over the River Teith. Other outdoor scenes were filmed in Kilbarchan, Church Street in particular has changed little since filming took place. Red Bridge In one of those first episodes, Dr. Finlay (Bill Simpson) crashed his old Bullnose Morris into the wall of Arden House‚Äîand that was not in the script. Another episode, filmed at night along Mugdock Road, found the local policeman, somewhat inebriated, on his bicycle in a scene with Dr. Snoddie. Episode 1 of series 8 was filmed in Kippen Stirlingshire using the local grocers and butchers shops and also the school. The interior scenes were shot in BBC studios in London and Glasgow.  Radio  From 1970 until 1978, episodes from Dr. Finlay's Casebook were broadcast on BBC Radio 4 with some of the same actors from the television programme. These episodes were adapted for radio from the original television scripts by the original writers, where possible. Twenty episodes were broadcast on BBC 7 in the autumn of 2003. In 2001 and 2002, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a version of the original Cronin stories using the titles, The Adventures of a Black Bag and Doctor Finlay ‚Äì Further Adventures of a Black Bag; these have been rebroadcast by BBC 7. The adaptations are set in Levenford, the original setting chosen by Cronin, rather than Tannochbrae. The role of Dr. Finlay was played by John Gordon Sinclair. Dr. Cameron was played by Brian Pettifer, and Janet was played initially by Katy Murphy, and then by Celia Imrie. David Tennant was a frequent guest actor. In 1991 BBC Enterprises produced a double cassette copy of four of the radio broadcasts (as of 13 November 2016 a copy of the cover is the profile picture on this listing). The Four episodes are: Out Of The Blue (TV episode Series 6 Broadcast 11 February 1968) (Radio episode 2 June 1970) The Comical Lad (TV episode Series 5 Broadcast 8 January 1967) (Radio episode 19 february 1973 The Honours List (TV episode Series 7 Broadcast 16 March 1969) (Radio episode 4 December 1973) Charlie is My Darling (TV episode Series 2 Broadcast 19 January 1964) (Radio episode 16 January 1975) The television versions of all these episodes are recorded as missing as of 13 November 2016.  Music  The programme's famous theme tune was Trevor Duncan's march from A Little Suite. The other two movements from the Suite were often used as background music. The characters from the series are featured in a song entitled Dr. Finlay by Andy Stewart, which was a minor Top 50 hit in 1965.  DVD and archive status  Simply Media TV released the first series of Dr Finlay's Casebook in March 2013, and the second series was released in April 2014. Only 10 episodes survive of the second series. The surviving episodes of series 3 and 4 were issued in 2015 and the remaining episodes series 5, 6 & 7 were released in January 2016. The nine surviving episodes from series 8 were released in April 2016. Of a complete run of 191 episodes, 122 are believed to no longer exist. Controversies Cronin received copies of the scripts, and he wrote a blunt letter to the series' script editor in 1964, expressing his dissatisfaction with the progression of the show. Word leaked to the media, and in June 1964, stories appeared in the national press suggesting that the author wanted the series to end. One newspaper even accused the author of \\"maliciously doing millions out of legitimate enjoyment.\\" The outcry from the viewing public was immediate, and sackfuls of mail were dispatched to Cronin's home in Switzerland. He issued a statement on 7 June to refute the charges made against him: By the following year, the series was a national institution. A Bill Simpson Fan Club was set up, Andy Stewart's Dr Finlay was in the Hit Parade for five weeks, and Andrew Cruickshank was invited as a guest of honour at the British Medical Association's annual dinner to speak on medical matters as if he were a real GP.Haining, Peter.

It was directed by Stephen Roberts, and starred Ronald Colman, Joan Bennett, and Colin Clive. The screenplay was written by Nunnally Johnson and Howard Smith, based on a play by Ilya Surgutchoff and Frederick Albert Swan. The film was inspired by the song of the same name popularised by Charles Coborn. Plot In Monte Carlo, Paul Gaillard, an impoverished Russian exiled aristocrat, has a fabulous run of luck, breaking the bank at the baccarat table. His winnings, ten million francs, are so vast he needs a suitcase (which he brought with him) to carry away the banknotes. The management desperately tries to entice him to stay, strewing various signs of good luck (four-leaf clovers, a horseshoe, even a hunchback) in his path, to no avail. Even worse from their viewpoint, Paul is quoted in the newspapers advising people to stay away from Monte Carlo. On the train, Paul encounters the beautiful Helen Berkeley when they share a table in the dining car. He overhears her and her male companion talking about Switzerland. In Paris, he goes to the Cafe Russe, where he shares the money with the staff. They scrimped and saved for ten years to build up their initial stake. The next day, Paul and his servant Ivan take the train to Interlaken, Switzerland. By chance, Helen is mistakenly placed in Paul's compartment. He takes the opportunity to try to charm her, but is rebuffed. He is delighted, however, to learn that the man with her is her brother Bertrand. Paul pursues her with great persistence, and it finally pays off. They spend time together. Then Helen confides that she is unhappy because she is going to marry a 63-year-old for money, not for herself, but for her brother, who needs 5 million francs. Paul offers her nearly 4 million, his share of the winnings. She does not accept, but asks him to spend a week with her in Monte Carlo. He agrees. It turns out she is a back street music hall performer who was hired to lure him back, but she cannot go through with it, having fallen in love with him. Too ashamed to face Paul again, she secretly departs for Paris. When he discovers she has vanished, he makes a bargain with her brother: he will get the money Bertrand supposedly needs desperately in return for his sister's location. Bertrand lies and tells him that she went to Monte Carlo. Helen runs into Bertrand at the train station and learns what he has done. She rushes to Monte Carlo. Paul returns to the baccarat table. When Helen enters the club to try to stop him, she is intercepted by the management and kept a virtual prisoner. Paul loses nearly all his money, but then his luck changes and he goes on another winning streak and he is on the verge of breaking the bank again. However, he loses everything on the very last bet. When Paul leaves, he sees Helen and Bertrand emerge from the manager's office; he congratulates them. He returns to work driving a taxi. By chance, he takes a fare to a nightclub where Helen is performing. He dons his black tie and tails and goes inside. He dances one dance with Helen and pretends to still be fairly well off, before driving away. Helen chases after him in another taxi, finally catching up with him at the Cafe Russe. When she discovers he is the driver, not a passenger, she is ecstatic. Now that he is poor, she can tell him that she loves him. They embrace. Then he takes her inside the closed Cafe Russe, where he and the staff, Russian nobility like him, are privately celebrating the late Czar Nicholas II's birthday in a grand manner.

Green's criticism of the film came mainly from the plotline involving the White Russians. According to Green, \\"I can never appreciate the pathos of princes who have become taxi-drivers and drink coffee essence instead of champagne; unlike other taxi-drivers they have had their champagne\\".

Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n (July 10, 1910 - July 28, 1987) was a renowned Vietnamese author. Current literature books for public school in Vietnam rank him as one of the nine biggest authors of contemporary Vietnamese literature. He is known for his essays on multiple subjects, with a clever and creative way in using the language. Hanoi has a street named after him, in the Thanh Xuan district.Eastern Culture - Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n (1910-1987) Biography Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n was born on July 10, 1910, on H√†ng B·∫°c street in Hanoi. His family lived in Th∆∞·ª£ng ƒê√¨nh hamlet, Nh√¢n M·ª•c commune (commonly known as M·ªçc village), today part of Nh√¢n Ch√≠nh ward, Thanh Xu√¢n district, Hanoi. His family adhered to the traditional Confucianism, but by the time of his childhood, Confucianism and traditional Chinese-influenced education had started to decline, replaced by more modern French-influenced culture. In 1929, during his last year of the intermediate schooling (the equivalence of ninth grade in junior high school), Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n was suspended because of his participation in a petition against a few French teachers, who demeaned Vietnamese people. Shortly after, he was imprisoned for illegally crossing the border of colonial French Indochina to Thailand. Upon his release, he started writing as a journalist and an author. Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n began his writings in the early 1930s, but only gained public recognition from 1938 with several essays and reports such as Vang B√≥ng M·ªôt Th·ªùi (Echo and Shadow Upon a Time), M·ªôt Chuy·∫øn ƒêi (A Trip), etc. In 1941, he was again imprisoned, this time for his communication with the political revolutionaries. After the August Revolution in 1945, Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n joined the Communist party and kept working as a writer. From 1948-1958, he held the position of Chief Secretary of Vietnamese Art & Literature Association. His works during this time feature mostly the scenery and cultural color of Vietnam, such as the collection of essays S√¥ng ƒê√† (River ƒê√†) (1960), a diary from the Vietnam War (1965‚Äì1975), among others. Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n died in Hanoi in 1987, leaving his readers a collection of exceedingly creative and artistic work. In 1996 he was awarded the Ho Chi Minh Award for Art and Literature. A vignette of the character Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n was first a patriot, who expressed deep love for traditional values and cultural beauties. Having a great appreciation of the Vietnamese language, he admired not only masterpieces from famous authors such as Nguy·ªÖn Du, ƒêo√†n Th·ªã ƒêi·ªÉm, T√∫ X∆∞∆°ng, T·∫£n ƒê√†..., but also the arts of the common people, like ca tr√π, a form of theatrical singing of northern Vietnam. The interest did not stop at being just a spectator, but helped him study and become knowledgeable at various topics, ranging from painting, sculpture, theater arts, to film. Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n was also one of the first actors of Vietnamese motion picture industry, with his participation in the first Vietnamese movie C√°nh ƒê·ªìng Ma (The Haunted Field). Unlike the traditional Vietnamese people whose life and perception were often enclosed by the border of their village, Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n was an adventurer. His early works, such as Thi·∫øu Qu√™ H∆∞∆°ng (Without a Homeland), depict a strong character yearning for change and adventure, to learn about the world outside one's comfort zone, and to improve oneself. He is said to claim that his personality is guided by the principle of ch·ªß nghƒ©a x√™ d·ªãch (\\"motionism\\"), having coined the term himself. He also envisioned himself as having a mindset greater than that of the society at the time, which provoked dispute from readers and the government officials. The conceited Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n gradually gave way to a calmer character as he aged, which showed in the change of tone in his works, going from self- centered to seldom self-humored and mostly observant and descriptive of the surroundings. Throughout his life, Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n stressed and highly valued individualism. Literary career and the main topics of interest Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n was not a successful writer from the beginning of his career. Having tried a variety of forms and techniques, such as poetry, journal, realist satire in the form of short story, he only realized his forte in essays in early 1938. This resulted in several successes: M·ªôt Chuy·∫øn ƒêi (A Trip), Vang B√≥ng M·ªôt Th·ªùi (Echo Shadow Upon A Time), Thi·∫øu Qu√™ H∆∞∆°ng (Without Homeland), Chi·∫øc L∆∞ ƒê·ªìng M·∫Øt Cua (The Crab-Eyed Copper Censer)... Before the August Revolution of 1945, the main topics of Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n's work revolved around \\"motionism\\", the beauty of the past, and the corrupted life style. The idea of \\"motionism\\" was first created from his frustration and helplessness toward the historical period and its society. As he traveled, or \\"moved\\", however, his appreciation for nature and culture of the country grew, and was documented in his work (M·ªôt Chuy·∫øn ƒêi) with care. The beauty of the past is portrayed in Vang B√≥ng M·ªôt Th·ªùi, with stories about old traditions, the old life style, which he collected from his trips. This collection of essays and short stories are written in a narrative voice of the Confucianists, whose roles were receding to the past and replaced by the new French-influenced culture. An example of this character type is Hu·∫•n Cao, in the short story Ch·ªØ Ng∆∞·ªùi T·ª≠ T√π (Penmanship of A Death Row Prisoner); Hu·∫•n Cao is another name of the historical figure Cao B√° Qu√°t, a revolutionary against French control in Vietnam. Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n's work during this period of time shows a disbelief in the present and the future. On the other hand, corrupt lifestyle is a common topic among the realist writers of the time, and Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n was not an exception. In his work involving this topic, the narrator was often confused and lost. Nonetheless, the characters, despite living in poor conditions, wish for a pure lifestyle and maintain their respectable traditional values. Such characteristics make Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n's work, Chi·∫øc L∆∞ ƒê·ªìng M·∫Øt Cua for example, different from other realists. After the August Revolution of 1945, Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n's work was heavily influenced by socialism and communism, as to be suitable for publication under the Communist government control. Although the stories and characters were changed, the style remained clever and honed to perfection. The main theme was still an illustration of his patriotism, with strong focus now shifted to the common people, farmers, workers, and military men, in a newly constructed society. Literary style Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n mastered the journal free style, with a tone easily distinguished from other authors. Before the August Revolution in 1945, his style can be summarized as free will with a dash of eccentricity. Every subject of his essays was described with artistic remarks and knowledgeable observations. After 1945, his works no longer seek the contrast between the old traditional values and the new life, but the tone still had the light combination of quaintness and youthful. Because Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n praised the idea of \\"motionism,\\" his characters are full of willful emotions; even the settings of his works usually reflected a sense of confidence and a majestic spirit, that is said to be higher than those of his surrounding environment and of his time (an example is the character B·∫°ch in Thi·∫øu Qu√™ H∆∞∆°ng (Without Homeland). Strongly emphasized, the self in Nguy·ªÖn Tu√¢n's works also carries careful thoughts and examination of the surroundings. The aloofness in early works was replaced by a more subtle self-humor, an indication of the maturity in his literary style and life.

World War II service Redesignated a net laying ship, AN-39, on 20 January 1944, Bitterbush completed outfitting on 26 February 1944, reported for duty to the Commander, Operational Training Command, Pacific, and departed Seattle, Washington, for San Diego, California, that same day. Following shakedown training, Bitterbush reported for duty to the Commandant, 12th Naval District, arriving at San Francisco, California, on 20 March. The ship worked the submarine nets at Tiburon, California, and San Francisco over the next eight months, before departing San Francisco Bay on 29 November 1944. Bitterbush made stops at Port Hueneme, Terminal Island, and San Pedro, California, before setting out across the Pacific Ocean on 5 December 1944. Proceeding to Pearl Harbor, the ship reported on 5 January 1945 to the Commander, 5th Amphibious Force, for duty. Underway from Oahu on 24 January 1945, the ship sailed via Eniwetok and Guam to Iwo Jima. After voyage repairs, Bitterbush worked on the submarine net line at the recently conquered island through the end of hostilities with Japan. End-of-war decommissioning  On 17 September 1945, she sailed for the United States. Proceeding via Saipan, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor, the ship reached San Francisco by 20 October 1945. Entering drydock soon after her arrival, the net layer‚Äîalthough at one time considered for use removing anti- submarine nets in the 12th Naval District‚Äîremained drydocked at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard until decommissioned on 4 January 1946. Deemed surplus to Navy needs, Bitterbush was struck from the Navy List on 21 January 1946. Transferred to the U.S. Maritime Commission for disposal on 6 May 1947, she was sold and converted for merchant service, in which capacity she operated from 1948 until destroyed by fire off Puerto Rico on 27 May 1954.

It is located not far where Zbruch falls into Dniester. The town is first mentioned after its fortress that was built in 1360s - 1370s. After the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia was torn apart between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the city was secured by the Lithuanian family of Koriatovychi, but later in the 15th century it was passed to the Polish Crown with which it stayed except Ottoman rule between 1672 and 1699 until the First partition of Poland in the late 18th century.

A stiftung foundation exists to give effect to the stated, non-commercial wishes of its founder, as set out in a foundation deed and the articles of association (statutes). In effect, the assets with which the foundation is endowed become a separate legal entity. A stiftung foundation has no shares or members and is set up by a founder(s) in most cases to ensure the continuation of family assets.http://pointonpartners.com.au/international-inheritance-wealth- planning-issues/Robert Gordon, Cross border Estate Planning: Juggling overseas assets and other international issues ‚Äì a question of jurisdiction?. A stiftung foundation can have beneficiaries, and in that way they are in some way similar to the common law notion of trusts. The founders also have the right to transfer and terminate the foundation. Stiftung are purely not for profit enterprises and commercial activities are generally not permitted to be conducted by them. This is the primary difference between an anstalt and a stiftung. Stiftung are usually administered by a board of trustees,http://www.lawandtax-news.com/html/liechtenstein/jlilatcos.html and there is no registration required to establish them. Theory yield n from the donated capital without taking into account future donations. The idea of a foundation is that in spite of the continuous use of the income for the purpose of the foundation (ie, not for compound interest), the total amount after a certain time exceeds the funded foundation stock. With a yield of, for example, four percent (lilac line), the sum of the income earned the founding capital after 25 years, after which the sum of the income is greater than the basic stock capital (green area in the upper right corner). History Stiftung have a long tradition. Plato had established his academy as a foundation and it lasted from 347 BC to 529 AD.Rupert Graf Strachwitz: Stiftungen in Deutschland: Geschichte und Gegenwart. Die Idee des Guten ‚Äì eines der obersten Ziele Platons. In: Stiftungen. (Gr√ºnenthal GmbH., Aachen 1996), p 90‚Äì96, hier p90. In the early Middle Ages, many nobles founded towns as stiftung-like legal entities, a technique which was soon used to establish hospitals, orphanages and other non-profit organizations. It was the establishment of monastic communities, however, mostly in the southern and eastern border regions of the Holy Roman Empire, where the theory of stiftung developed most. Many famous church buildings and monasteries were early foundations of stiftung activity. Many of the 9th century foundations survive today notably in Wemding, Bavaria which dates back to the 10th century. Otto I donated the lady's donation at Quedlinburg Abbey which lasted from 936 to 1802. When Roman law began to take root in Germany during the 13th century, many social structures changed including considerable urbanization. Numerous Stiftung foundations were created at this time and many have survived the vicissitudes of history. Stiftung foundations took on a distinctly non-profit nature in response to the invention of corporations under the legal scholar and Pope, Innocent IV. Burger Hospital and wine shop *The stiftung foundation of B√ºrgerspital zum Heiligen Geist in W√ºrzburg is a good example of how they function. Founded in 1316, it is only one of about 250 examples of foundations that are older than 500 years which still exist today. The foundation provides geriatric services for the citizens of the burger, and is funded by the vineyard on the foundations estates. *The well-known social housing stiftung, Fuggerei in Augsburg, which is regarded as the oldest still existing social housing settlement, was founded in 1519, by the leading inhabitants of the town (foundation letter of 1521) and is therefore a few years younger than the social housing foundation of Valentin Ostertag. *The St√§delsche Kunstinstitut and St√§dtische Galerie (museum and art gallery) in Frankfurt am Main is one of the most important German art museums with a collection of more than 4000 paintings from the Middle Ages to Modern and Contemporary Art. The early modern era saw the foundation of Francke Foundation in Halle in the year 1698, the Foundation St√§delsches Kunstinstitut, 1815 and the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung in 1889. The 20th century was a low point for stiftung. The hyperinflation of the 1920-1930s, the rise of the third Reich and the division of Germany, especially communist control of East Germany saw the decline in the formation of new stiftung, and many older foundations run their course. Changes in the charitable law and the foundation civil law (as of 2000) and the associated broader public debate on the meaning and value of foundations, together with the strong growth of private assets and the re-emergence of the concept of citizenship, have ensured that today in one year about as many foundations are formed as were in a decade at the end of the 20th century. In addition to private donor personalities, companies, associations, associations and local authorities are also increasingly active as founders. Geographic distribution Stiftung are a civil law construct, found mostly in German- speaking areas. Civil law stiftung foundations have developed in Austria, Cyprus, Italy, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands (Stichting), Netherlands Antilles, Spain, Sweden (Stiftelse), Switzerland, Panama (1975), and more recently in St Kitts (2003), Nevis (2004), Bahamas (2005), Anguilla (2006), Antigua and Barbuda (2006), Malta (2006), Jersey(2009), and Labuan, Malaysia (2010).

Golden Shears competition 2007 It was founded in Masterton, New Zealand, and has been held in the town's War Memorial Stadium each March since 1961. It initially comprised competition in three shearing classes, including the Open championship, which is the most revered of all single shearing titles worldwide. In the final, sometimes referred to as shearing's equivalent of the Wimbledon Open in tennis, six shearers each shear 20 second-shear sheep, for which the fastest time was 15min 27.4sec, shorn in 2003. But the competition is about more than just the fastest time, and the winner is decided on time and quality penalty points, the winner being the shearer with the lowest score. Other events have expanded the programme over the years, with competition now held in five shearing classes, four woolhandling classes and three woolpressing classes, along with other events. The McSkimming Memorial Triple Crown final was added to the programme in 1973, and in various sponsorship guises has become the unofficial New Zealand multiwools national championship. Currently known as the PGG Wrightson National Circuit, it is shorn in five qualifying stages in which points are accrued for shearing finewooled merino sheep, fullwooled strongwool sheep, coarse-wooled Corriedales, lambs and second-shear sheep. In the final, six competitors shear three of each type. The Golden Shears in Masterton spawned Golden Shears championships in other countries, including the United Kingdom, where a Golden Shears of Great Britain was held at the Royal Bath and West Show, and Australia, which became involved in an annual home-and-away transtasman test series, staged alternately at Masterton, and at Euroa, Vic. Suspended for some years after industrial disturbances in Australia, the Australian legs of the series are now held at differing venues in conjunction with the Australisan national championships. While machine shearing contests have been held at least since 1902, when an event was held at the Hawke's Bay A and P Show, Hastings, New Zealand, the Golden Shears is credited with the spread of shearing as a world-wide sport, including a Golden Shears World Championships, held first in England in 1977. Despite the advent of a World Championships every 2‚Äì4 years, the Golden Shears in Masterton every year remains the mecca for sheep shearers worldwide, and entries in all classes have in peak years exceeded 600. The Golden Shears World Shearing & Wool Handling Championships is a global competition featuring over 30 countries.

In July 2015 she was reportedly stealing again and was believed to have stolen a $33,000 (US) ring, although this has not been proven. On October 23, 2015 she was caught on security cameras putting Christian Dior earrings valued at $690.00 in her pocket at an Atlanta, Georgia Saks Fifth Avenue store. She was arrested and charged with shoplifting by Officers from the Atlanta Police Department. Payne has openly spoken about her crimes and has used at least 20 aliases, at least ten social security numbers and at least nine dates of birth. It is alleged in Charlotte, North Carolina, that on July 11, 2015, Payne visited a jewelry store at SouthPark Mall. After she left, store employees realized a diamond ring valued at $33,000 was missing from a showcase. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department did not issue an official statement or APB, but local ABC affiliate WSOC-TV obtained a copy of an email sent to all area jewelers regarding the alleged crime and alerting them to be on the lookout. An arrest warrant was issued for Payne in August 2015, by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg sheriff's department. In Atlanta, Georgia, on December 13, 2016 she was again arrested on larceny charges. On July 17, 2017 she was arrested for stealing $86.22 worth of merchandise from an Atlanta area Wal- Mart, while wearing the ankle bracelet from her previous arrest. In popular culture There is a documentary film about her life, entitled The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne, in which Payne describes in detail many of her crimes, from the earliest thefts in her youth, up to her arrest in 2011, at age 80, for stealing a diamond ring from a Macy's department store. The trial for this crime is chronicled in the documentary, and her last interview in the film takes place in prison, as she was convicted of the crime. Updates during the credits, however, inform the audience that she had since been released, only to commit, and be convicted of, another jewelry theft soon after at age 83. A hidden-camera scenario on the show What Would You Do? had a character based on Payne. A film of Payne's life is being developed by Codeblack Films.

It is a zoonotic pathogen transmitted to humans by the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum). It is the causative agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis. Genetic studies support the endosymbiotic theory that a subset of these organisms evolved to live inside mammalian cells as mitochondria to provide cellular energy to the cells in return for protection and sustenance. ATP production in the rickettsiae is biochemically identical to that in mammalian mitochondria; all multi-cellular eukaryotes have mitochondria in their cells, including birds, fish, reptiles, invertebrates, plants, and fungi in addition to mammals. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by E. chaffeensis is known to spread through tick infection primarily in the Southern, South-central and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. In recent years, the lone star tick has expanded its range along the East Coast to New England, putting more humans at risk for tick-borne infections.Little, S. E. (2007, January). New developments in managing vector-borne diseases. Retrieved from http://www.iknowledgenow.com/tocnavc2007smallanimal.cfm It is named for Fort Chaffee, where the bacterium was first discovered in blood samples of infected patients. Transmission cycle E. chaffeensis is maintained in nature through a complex zoonotic relationship. The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is known to be the main competent reservoir for E. chaffeensis and the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) is the principal vector for human transmission. Some evidence shows that other organisms may serve as reservoirs for the bacteria such as domestic goats, domestic dogs, raccoons, and coyotes. E. chaffeensis can be transmitted to uninfected tick larvae when feeding on the blood from an infected host. The infection is then maintained and can be transmitted to a reservoir organism or humans at the nymphal stage. Adult ticks can maintain the infection or be infected from feeding on the blood of an infected reservoir organism and may also pass E. chaffeensis to humans or other uninfected reservoir organisms. Transovarial transmission is not known to occur, so eggs and unfed larvae are not believed to be infected. Pathogenesis Ehrlichia chaffeensis E. chaffeensis causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis and is known to infect monocytes. It has also been known to infect other cell types such as lymphocytes, atypical lymphocytes, myelocytes, and neutrophils, but monocytes appear to best harbor the infection. E. chaffeensis has also been shown to infect canines both naturally and artificially.Baneth, G. (2010). Ehrlichia and anaplasma infections. Paper presented at World small animal veterinary congress. Retrieved from http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/wsava/2010/d12.pdf Symptoms in canine infections are hard to differentiate between E. chaffeensis infection and E. canis, which is the species of Ehrlichia that most commonly affects canines.

Some patients may also have myalgias or arthralgias, and an estimated 10‚Äì40% of patients may develop coughing, pharyngitis, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and changes in mental status. Diagnosis or detection A variety of procedures have been used to detect E. chaffeensis in humans and reservoir organisms. Most commonly, serologic testing and PCR amplification are used. Treatment E. chaffeensis is susceptible to tetracyclines.

It has recently been associated with human infection, and can be detected via PCR serological testing. The name Ehrlichia ewingii was proposed in 1992.  Taxonomy and characterization = Taxonomy = The current classification is Bacteria, Proteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Rickettsiales, Anaplasmataceae, Ehrlichia ewingii. Classification of different members of the genus Ehrlichia has been disputed, however, it is generally agreed that close relatives of Ehrlichia ewingii are Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia canis. It is also closely related to Wolbachia, Anaplasma, and Neorickettsia bacteria, with Rickettsia as a more distant genus. = Characterization = Species in the family Anaplasmataceae have unique characteristics that can help differentiate them from other families including: sensitivity to mechanical stress, changes in osmolarity, and thawing. All Ehrlichia sp. are gram-negative and spherical with a rippled outer membrane that shows no peptidoglycan layer or any lipopolysaccharides.  History = Discovery = In 1971 Ewing et al. detected a new Ehrlichia strain, which was thought of as another Ehrlichia canis strain. Ehrlichia canis is usually found in lymphocytes and monocytes, but this new strain was found in granulocytes.Ewing, S. A., W. R. Roberson, R. G. Buckner, and C. S. Hayat. 1971. A new strain of Ehrlichia canis. J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. 159:1771-1774. Due to the variable location, this strain was called Canine Granulocytic Ehrlichia (CGE). = Method of identification = A field study was conducted by Anderson et al. on June 18, 1987 using a canine diagnosed with granulocytic ehrlichiosis: an infection of the granulocytes by a member of the Ehrlichia sp. The blood from this canine was infused in another specimen to ensure the blood transmission of the intracellular parasite. This transmission was then completed using ticks of the species Amblyomma americanum by exposing them to infected dogs and then to susceptible ones. From blood samples, 16S rRNA genes were amplified using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the genes were analyzed using gel electrophoresis and a GAP (Genetic Analysis Program) system. This data was compared to all other Ehrlichia species, and Anderson et al. found that CGE is most closely related to E. chaffeensis and E. canis. These three‚ÄîE. ewingii, E. chaffeensis, and E. canis‚Äîform a group in terms of relatedness within the genus Ehrlichia. Despite being related, due to the level of divergence between CGE and the other species, it has been determined that CGE deserves to have species level recognition. The name was proposed to be Ehrlichia ewingii, named after S.A. Ewing who initially identified the parasitic organism.  Metabolism and genomics = Genomics = This organism mostly uses host cell machinery to replicate its genome. Although the genome itself has not been sequenced, the use of the host cell for replication is known based on comparisons to other Ehrlichia sp. Since Ehrlichia ewingii is unable to synthesize all the organic compounds required for growth, also known as an auxotroph, the bacterium requires a host for growth and survival. = Metabolism = No specific studies on E. ewingii metabolism have been conducted so far. However, the organism is assumed to have a similar metabolism to members of the genus due to the high similarity between functional 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the highly related infections they cause within cells.  Ecology  All Ehrlichia sp. are obligate intracellular parasites that are transmitted by ticks to vertebrate animals; Ehrlichia ewingii is specifically transmitted by the North American Tick, Amblyomma americanum. This bacterium then infects granulocytes in canines and humans. Currently, Ehrlichia ewingii cannot be cultivated in a number of cell lines, meaning that study of this organism is dependent on extraction from arthropod and vertebrate hosts.  Disease and treatment  Ehrlichia ewingii is a human pathogen which results in a serious infection if not treated in a timely manner. Ehrlichiosis, the disease caused by E. ewingii and E. chaffeensis, presents with fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. These symptoms are extremely unspecific which makes the infections difficult to diagnose. Doxycycline is effective when administered early in the infection, but despite this, the estimated fatality rate is still 1.8%. This is partially due to the difficulty diagnosing the causative agent of infection, however further Ehrlichia ewingii research could allow better diagnostic tests to identify ehrlichial infections before they progress to severe cases.

Whittaker says \\"one of the ideas I had was to invite listeners to send their poems or lyrics to me and I would make songs out of them. We got a million replies, and I did one each week for 26 weeks.\\"Hyatt, Wesley (1999). The Billboard Book of #1 Adult Contemporary Hits (Billboard Publications) Ron A.

These ticks also transmit Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The bacteria infect white blood cells called neutrophils, causing changes in gene expression that prolong the life of these otherwise short-lived cells. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms may include: * fever * severe headache * muscle aches (myalgia) * chills and shaking, similar to the symptoms of influenza * nausea * vomiting * loss of appetite * unintentional weight loss * abdominal pain * cough * diarrhea, * aching joints * sensitivity to light * weakness * fatigue * change in mental status (extreme confusion, memory loss, inability to comprehend environment- interaction, reading, etc.) * temporary loss of basic motor skills Symptoms may be minor, as evidenced by surveillance studies in high-risk areas. Gastrointestinal tract symptoms occur in less than half of patients and a skin rash is seen in less than 10% of patients. It is also characterized by a low number of platelets, a low number of white blood cells, and elevated serum transaminase levels in the majority of infected patients.Murray, Patrick R.; Rosenthal, Ken S.; Pfaller, Michael A. Medical Microbiology, Fifth Edition. United States: Elsevier Mosby, 2005 Even though people of any age can get HGA, it is usually more severe in the aging or immune-compromised. Some severe complications may include respiratory failure, kidney failure, and secondary infections. Cause A. phagocytophilum is transmitted to humans by Ixodes ticks. These ticks are found in the US, Europe, and Asia. In the US, I. scapularis is the tick vector in the East and Midwest states, and I. pacificus in the Pacific Northwest. In Europe, the I. ricinus is the main tick vector, and I. persulcatus is the currently known tick vector in Asia. The major mammalian reservoir for A. phagocytophilum in the eastern United States is the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus. Although white-tailed deer and other small mammals harbor A. phagocytophilum, evidence suggests that they are not a reservoir for the strains that cause HGA. A tick that has a blood meal from an infected reservoir becomes infected themselves. If an infected tick then latches onto a human the disease is then transmitted to the human host and A. phagocytophilum symptoms can arise. Anaplasma phagocytophilum shares its tick vector with other human pathogens, and about 10% of patients with HGA show serologic evidence of coinfection with Lyme disease, babesiosis, or tick-borne meningoencephalitis. While it is rare, it is possible for HGA to be transmitted human-to-human via a blood transfusion, in which case it is called Transfusion-Transmitted Anaplasmosis (TTA). = Major surface proteins = Many MSPs are found in Anaplasma and those which interact with Anaplasma can mainly be found in A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum. There are many different phenotypic traits that are associated with MSPs, because each MSP can only infect certain animals in certain conditions. A. phagocytophilum infects the most vast array of living things, including humans, and all around the world. A. marginale evolved to be more specific in infecting animals, such as deer and cattle in the subtropics and tropics. The main difference between these two MSPs is that the host cell for A. phagocytophilum is the granulocyte, while the host cell for A. marginale is erythrocytes. It is likely that these MSPs coevolved, because they had previously interacted via tick-pathogen interaction. Anaplasma MSPs can not only cooperate with vertebrates, but also invertebrates, which make these phenotypes evolve faster than others, because they have a lot of selective forces acting on them. Diagnosis Clinically, HGA is essentially indistinguishable from human monocytic ehrlichiosis, the infection caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and other tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease may be suspected. As Ehrlichia serologies can be negative in the acute period, PCR is very useful for diagnosis. Prevention Currently, there is no vaccine against human granulocytic anaplasmosis, so antibiotics are the only form of treatment. The best way to prevent HGA is to prevent getting tick bites. Treatment Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. If anaplasmosis is suspected, treatment should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive laboratory confirmation, as prompt doxycycline therapy has been shown to improve outcomes. Presentation during early pregnancy can complicate treatment. Doxycycline compromises dental enamel during development. Although rifampin is indicated for post-delivery pediatric and some doxycycline- allergic patients, it is teratogenic. Rifampin is contraindicated during conception and pregnancy. If the disease is not treated quickly, sometimes before the diagnosis, the person has a high chance of mortality. Most people make a complete recovery, though some people are intensively cared for after treatment. A reason for a person needing intensive care is if the person goes too long without seeing a doctor or being diagnosed. The majority of people, though, make a complete recovery with no residual damage.  History  The first outbreak of Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis (HGA) in the United States was in a patient in early 1990 in Wisconsin. He was kept in the hospital in Minnesota for testing, but died without a diagnosis. Over the next couple of years, many people within the same area of Wisconsin and Minnesota had come down with the same symptoms. It was discovered in 1994 that it was Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE), later to be known as HGA. Epidemiology From the first reported case in 1994 until 2010, HGA's rates of incidence have exponentially increased. This is likely because HGA is found where there are ticks that carry and transmit Lyme disease, also known as Borrelia burgdorferi, and babesiosis, which is found in the northeastern and midwestern United States, which has seemingly increased in the past couple of decades. Before 2000, there were less than 300 cases reported per year. In 2000, there were only 350 reported cases. From 2009-2010, HGA experienced a 52% increase in the number of cases reported.

They speak the Digor dialect of the Eastern Iranian Ossetian language, which in USSR was considered a separate language until 1937. Starting from 1932 it is considered just a dialect of Ossetian language. The speakers of the other dialect - Iron - do not understand Digor, although the Digor usually understand Iron, as it was the official language of the Ossetian people and officially taught in schools. In the 2002 Russian Census 607 Digors were registered, but in the 2010 Russian Census their number was only 223. It was estimated that there are 100,000 speakers of the dialect, most of whom declared themselves Ossetians. The Digor mainly live in Digorsky, Irafsky, Mozdoksky districts and Vladikavkaz, North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania, also in Kabardino-Balkaria, Turkey and Syria.  History  Among the tribal names given in \\"Ashkharatsuyts\\" there is an ethnonym ashtigor, which is considered to be the name of the Digors. This fact, and other linguistic considerations, have led experts to believe that Digor dialect became separated from Proto- Ossetian during the Mongol conquests. In \\"Ashkharatsuyts\\" Ashtigors are given separately from Alans - the ancestors of present-day Ossetians. Also starting from the 18th century the ethnonym digor is widely used by travelers and in Russian official documents. Based on these facts, Ossetian Soviet linguist- Iranist Vasily Abaev suppose that the Digors could be an iranized Circassian tribe and the first part of the name - dig- can have the same roots with the Circassian endonym Adyge and -or can be just a prefix for plurality as in many contemporary Caucasian languages. Digors make the majority of the Ossetians in Digoria - the western part of the North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania (Digorsky and Irafsky districts) and in Kabardino-Balkaria. In the beginning of the 19th century some families from Digoria resettled in Mozdoksky District and there are 2 large settlements of them. Digoria was annexed to the Russian Empire quite late compared to the rest of Ossetia. The Digors were converted to Sunni Islam in the 17-18th centuries under the influence of the neighboring Kabarday people who introduced Islam to them. In the second half of the 19th century large numbers of Muslim Digors emigrated to the Ottoman Empire. (see: Ossetians in Turkey) During World War II, North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania was occupied by German armies in 1942. While under Nazi occupation the Ossetians remained unmoved, after the Germans were forced out of the region the Muslim Digors, like other Muslim peoples, were accused of Collaboration with the Germans and deported to Central Asia. Estimates say 50% of the Digors died during deportation. Their reputation was rehabilitated in the mid 1950s, and they were allowed to return to their homelands.

It connects Via dei Pettinari in the Rione of Regola to Piazza Trilussa in Trastevere. The construction of the current bridge occurred between 1473 and 1479, and was commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV (r. 1471-84), after whom it is named, from the architect Baccio Pontelli, who reused the foundations of a prior Roman bridge, the Pons Aurelius, which had been destroyed during the early Middle Ages. Currently traffic on the bridge is restricted to pedestrians. (According to Mandell Creighton's History of the Papacy, the Sistine Bridge was built of blocks from the Coliseum. Further, that Sixtus was mindful of the disaster which had occurred in the Jubilee of 1450 through the crowding of the Bridge of S. Angelo, which was the only available means of communication with S. Peter's.)  Roman Pons Aurelius  The Fontanone di Ponte Sisto (1612) presently in Piazza Trilussa, facing the bridge at the south bank of the Tiber. The predecessor bridge to Ponte Sisto, the Pons Aurelius, was first mentioned by authors in the 4th and 5th centuries and was later known in the Middle Ages as \\"Pons Antoninus,\\" \\"Pons Antonini in Arenula,\\" and \\"Pons Ianicularis id est pons ruptus vulgariter nominatus et Tremelus et Antoninus.\\"The \\"Antonine Bridge\\", the Bridge of the Antonines in via Arenula\\", and the \\"Bridge to the Janiculum, that is, the broken bridge commonly called both 'Tremelus' and 'Antonine'\\". The Pons Antoninus was partially destroyed in 772, at the time the Lombard king Desiderius took Rome, and rebuilt in its current form by Pope Sixtus IV, whose name it carries to this day.  Renaissance Ponte Sisto  The bridge is architecturally characteristic because of the \\"oculus\\" or eye lightening the masonry of its central spandrel: this was erected to diminish the river's pressure on the bridge in case of flood. On the left bridge head are placed the copies of two marble slabs (removed in the 1990s after continued vandalism) bearing an elegant Latin inscription composed by Renaissance humanist Bartolomeo Platina in honour of Sixtus IV in occasion of the construction of the bridge. They recite: :XYSTVS IIII PONT MAX :AD VTILITATEM P RO PEREGRINAEQVE MVLTI :TVDINIS AD JVBILAEVM VENTVRAE PONTEM :HVNC QVEM MERITO RVPTVM VOCABANT A FVN :DAMENTIS MAGNA CVRA ET IMPENSA RESTI :TVIT XYSTVMQVE SVO DE NOMINE APPELLARI VOLVIT Detail of an arch and :MCCCCLXXV :QVI TRANSIS XYST QVARTI BENEFICIO :DEVM ROGA VT PONTEFICEM OPTIMVM MAXI :MVM DIV NOBIS SALVET AC SOSPITET BENE :VALE QVISQVIS ES VBI HAEC PRECATVS :FVERIS On the corner of via dei Pettinari and via Giulia once stood a fountain (the Fontanone di Ponte Sisto or dei Cento Preti), which relayed water from the great fountain called the Acqua Paola, derived originally from a Roman aqueduct brought back to working order by Pope Paul V (r. 1605-21): the water was brought from Lake Bracciano to Trastevere and from there over the Ponte Sisto to the Campo Marzio. The bridge still carries the water of the Acqua Paola across the river in eight large pipes. Baroque and Modern age The bridge at night with Saint Peter's dome in background On 20 August 1662, a brawl erupting between some Corsican soldiers controlling the bridge and Frenchmen belonging to the retinue of the French ambassador triggered the Corsican Guard Affair and had as effect the disbanding of the Corsican Guard, a corp of mercenaries originating from the island having police duties in Rome. After the Unification of Italy in 1870, the buildings surrounding the mostra dell'acqua paola were destroyed for the erection of the Lungotevere along the river side, and the fountain itself was relocated to Piazza Trilussa on the other side of the bridge, where it delivers water to this day. In 1877, two large cast-iron pedestrian gangways resting on marble consoles were added to the sides of the bridge. After considerable controversies, Rome\`s mayor Francesco Rutelli let them be demolished in 2000, restoring Ponte Sisto\`s pristine silhouette, and since then traffic on the bridge has been restricted to pedestrians. The Ponte Sisto connects the lively and popular Campo de' Fiori area (reached through via dei Pettinari) and via Giulia with Piazza Trilussa in Trastevere across the river, where many young Romans and tourists gather for an aperitivo on a Friday night.

This bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogen affecting monocytes and macrophages. Symptom and signs The most common symptoms are fever, headache, malaise, and muscle aches (myalgia). Compared to human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, rash is more common. Laboratory abnormalities include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver tests. The severity of the illness can range from minor or asymptomatic to life- threatening. CNS involvement may occur. A serious septic or toxic shock-like picture can also develop, especially in patients with impaired immunity. Cause This disease is known to be caused by tick bites. Diagnosis Tick exposure is often overlooked. For patients living in high-prevalence areas who spend time outdoors, a high degree of clinical suspicion should be employed.Ehrlichia serologies can be negative in the acute period. PCR is therefore the laboratory diagnostic tool of choice. Treatment If ehrlichiosis is suspected, treatment should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive laboratory confirmation, as prompt doxycycline therapy has been associated with improved outcomes. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. Presentation during early pregnancy can complicate treatment.Rifampin has been used in pregnancy and in patients allergic to doxycycline. Epidemiology In the US, HME occurs across the south-central, southeastern, and mid-Atlantic states, regions where both the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum) thrive. HME occurs in California in Ixodes pacificus ticks and in Dermacentor variabilis ticks. Nearly 600 cases were reported to the CDC in 2006. In 2001‚Äì2002, the incidence was highest in Missouri, Tennessee, and Oklahoma, as well as in people older than 60.

A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and the Internet. 3. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2007. Page 351. . This phenomenon has been brought about largely due to the creation of social networking sites such as Digg and Newsvine. The effect of democratic journalism is that it promotes news based on the popular opinion of the majority, or the \\"wisdom of the crowd\\". This differs from more traditional approaches, such as the one commonly used in the newspaper industry, where an editor would decide whether to print a particular news story. Some authors look at democratic journalism as taking in rights to free speech, assembly, human rights, the rule of law and other mechanisms to check abuses. It also takes in civic consciousness and social solidarity. Journalism then has a clear link with democracy, and is shaped accordingly. This would also have different meanings in First, Second and Third World nations. The democratic role of journalism should transcend excessive commercialism, sensationalism, and manipulation by media elites.Grave New World?

Problems A common problem faced by democratic journalism is the unreliability and bias of the voting system used, which may not reflect the actual opinions of the majority. Many of the mediums which help enable democratic journalism suffer from problems such as gaming, bias, censorship, and lack of professional review. However, other approaches will also suffer from many of these problems. In order to get a set of news stories, at some point, something must decide one story's rank over another using some criteria.

While still stranded, Ailanthus was reassigned to the newly constituted 17th Naval District (the Alaskan portion of the old 13th Naval District to which she had originally been assigned). Finally, she was declared a total loss, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 9 June 1944.
