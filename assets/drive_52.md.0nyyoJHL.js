It addresses Mary, the mother of Jesus, to be imitated living the theological virtues of faith, hope and love. The song is included in song books and the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob.  History  The poem was written by the Franciscan Helmut Schlegel in 2009. It is in three similar stanzas, each with five uneven lines without rhyme. It addresses Mary, the mother of Jesus and refers to biblical scenes from her life. The text has been set to music by Joachim Raabe. The hymn appears in the regional part of the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob of the Diocese of Limburg as GL 885. It is also part of Junges Gotteslob, the hymnal for young people, and of the choral songbook Die Tr√§ume h√ºten (Guarding the dreams) in the section Maria, published by the Dehm-Verlag. The song was included in a four-part setting with orchestra by Peter Reulein in his oratorio Laudato si', which premiered in 2016 at the Limburg Cathedral.  Text and melody  The first stanza is the model for the others. In the first short line, Mary is addressed, \\"Glauben k√∂nnen wie du\\" in the first stanza, \\"Hoffen k√∂nnen wie du\\" in the second, \\"Lieben k√∂nnen wie Du\\". Glauben, Hoffen, Lieben relates to the teaching of Paul the Apostle about the theological virtues of faith, hope and love. The speaker or singer acknowledges that Mary is able to believe, hope and love, and wishes to be able to do the same. The second and third line, both much longer, describe more precisely what the action comprises. The long fourth line leads to a biblical quotation. This is in the first stanza \\"Gro√ües hat er getan.\\" () from the Magnificat, in the second stanza \\"Was er euch sagt, das tut.\\" () from the Wedding at Cana, and finally \\"Mir geschehe dein Wort\\" () from the Annunciation. The final short line of a stanza is the first to use \\"ich\\" (I) and expresses the wish of the singer to imitate Mary: \\"So will ich glauben (hoffen, lieben), Maria\\" (I want to believe (hope, love) like this, Mary.). The melody is in F major and 6/8 time. It is built in six phrases of mostly two measures. The first and last lines end on long notes, while the second and third line carry their longer text in mostly even eighth-notes. The announcement of the biblical quotation is an extra measure, then the quotation is represented by a rising line which ends on the longest note of the song. The last line is a gentle downward line. The melody has been described by Manuel Braun, organist in the Diocese of Limburg, as easy to learn.

He attended the University of Illinois and Northwestern University. Career Blake left college and became the accompanist for Anita O'Day, a jazz singer, and for Lord Buckley, a comedian. He also played for Bud Freeman, Stuff Smith, June Christie and Chris Connor. In the 1950s Blake, up until that time a petty thief (\\"the world's most inept burglar\\"), became a literary sensation when he published his letters in the Paris Review. Blake, who was gay, was a kept man of a Charleston aristocrat, whose name Blake did not reveal in his letters. In 1971, he published them in The joint: Letters from Prison. A section of The Joint and a short story, The Widow, Bereft, appeared in Esquire Magazine and the short story was selected by Martha Foley and Whit Burnett and included in Best American Short Stories of 1971.

It was the first railway bridge in Belgrade and today is one of two across the Sava, and three in general. It is not operational since the summer of 2018.  Location  From the old, ≈†umadija section of the city, it crosses the Sava between the southern extension of the Bara Venecija neighborhood, just north of the Belgrade Fair complex. On the Syrmian side, it enters New Belgrade next to the industrial neighborhoods of Savski Nasip and Mala Ciganlija. It is located between the Gazela Bridge on the north and the New Railroad Bridge on the south.  History   Origin  At the 1878 Congress of Berlin, Principality of Serbia was de jure recognized as an independent state from the Ottoman Empire and the great powers of the day decided that Serbia should construct the railway. Not economically developed to begin with, Serbia was additionally pauperized after the Serbian-Ottoman wars from 1876 to 1878, so it lacked the funds. Prince Milan Obrenoviƒá and the government announced the request for tender and the bidding was won by a French company. Popular story goes that prince Milan took a bribe of 1 million francs in gold, in order to give the job to the French, but that was never proven.  Construction  The concession included the construction of the Belgrade‚ÄìNi≈° railway, the railway bridge over the Sava and a railway which will connect Belgrade to Zemun, at the time, the border town of Austria- Hungary. Serbian state had the obligation to build the railway station but the works on the building lagged behind the construction of the railway and the bridge, so when the time came for the first train to pass through Belgrade, the object wasn't finished. It had to be ceremonially open, even though it was still covered with scaffolds. The first train from this station departed towards Zemun with courtly honors, on , at 3 p.m.Srpske novine, 21 August 1884 As Serbia was declared a kingdom in 1882, the first passengers were now King Milan, Queen Natalie and the Crown Prince Alexander, on the way to Vienna. Construction of the bridge, however, began in January 1882 and was finished in 31 months, which was a great accomplishment. It was finished in the summer of 1884. The load test was organized on and the day after. 24 carts loaded with pebble and 9 locomotives tested it. The state technical inspection was done one day later, when the royal train crossed the bridge. When constructed, the long bridge on six, cuboid-shaped stone pillars, weighted 7,200 tons. The bridge was under the joint ownership of Serbia and Austria-Hungary.  World War I  Demolished bridge The bridge was demolished in both World Wars (three times only in the World War I) and the present construction was placed after the World War II ended. When the World War I broke out on 28 July 1914, the bridge was the only connection between Serbia and the Austria-Hungary who already positioned its army near the bridge. On 29 July 1914, at 1:30 a.m., captain Mihailo Aliƒá, with his platoon of pontoniers blew up the bridge. When the powerful explosion resounded, the entire city trembled. Three parts of the steel construction fell into the river. Cutting off the only link was instrumental in the defense of the city during the inaugural period of the war. Austro-Hungarians were now forced either to invade using boats or to try to secure a foothill on the Ada Ciganlija island, which they attempted during the Battles of Ada Ciganlija. The Hungarian ship \\"Alkotm√°ny\\" was beneath the bridge when it collapsed. As the pillars and foundations were left unharmed, the bridge was restored by the end of 1914, but the Austro-Hungarian army damaged it in 1915. After occupying Belgrade, the military authorities restored the bridge in 1916, building also a new railroad which directly connected the bridge with the Topƒçider railway station, so that trains coming from Zemun didn't have to go through the Belgrade Main Station. The bridge was demolished again on 1 November 1918 by the retreating occupational army and several parts of the construction fell into the river. The pillars, however, again remained almost undamaged, so the bridge was open for traffic in October 1919.  Interbellum  Even though being operational, the works on the bridge continued. The grid-like steel construction was added by 1920, while all the works were completed only by 1922. Despite losing its international status and becoming an internal bridge with the creation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in 1918, the importance of the bridge grew as the amount of traffic greatly increased.  World War II  When Germany attacked Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, the High Command decided to demolish all three existing bridges in Belgrade, including the railway bridge. Military commander of Belgrade, general Vojislav Nikolajeviƒá, was ordered to demolish them, and the order for the Old Railway Bridge was executed by sub-lieutenant Oskar Klan≈°ƒçek. That didn't stop the invading army, so already by the end of April 1941, Germans began the reconstruction. They employed the specialized engineering units and the Polish prisoners. Provisional reparations were completed the same spring, from 23 April to 29 May, and the bridge was renamed the General Will Bridge (General Will-Br√ºcke). The bridge was inaugurated by the General Joachim von Kortzfleisch and the train decorated with flowers crossed over it. In 1942, in order to expand the capacity of the railway traffic, Germans began building another, parallel bridge, downstream from the old bridge. The works progressed to a certain degree, but the twin bridge was never finished. In 1944 both constructions were damaged, partly in the massive Allied bombings and partly by the withdrawing German army on 19 October 1944. Both bridges were significantly damaged, the old one much more so. Because of that, the original plan was to fix the new, unfinished bridge to become operational, but after 7 months the decision was changed and the government opted for the reconstruction of the old bridge. The steel construction of the new bridge practically just slid into the Sava, so it was used for the old bridge. The long steel construction, with the spans between the main carriers, was open in December 1945. Some works extended into 1946 and the reconstruction was funded by the war reparations.  After 1945  View on the bridge from the Belgrade Fair promenade along the Sava Though projected as a temporary link in 1945, the bridge was reconstructed in 1986, when the tracks were replaced. Minor repairs on the bridge have been done in 1995 and 1996. In any of its incarnations, the bridge was never fully painted. Popular story says that it is because the planners forgot to calculate the weight of the paint needed for the entire bridge. Also, in different periods the bridge had an arched construction, a grid-like one and the combined arched-grid construction. It partially lost importance when the New Railroad Bridge, part of the projected Belgrade railway junction, was open in 1979, but it became almost completely obsolete with the shutting down of the Belgrade Main railway station on 30 June 2018 and discontinuation of the railway traffic around the Belgrade Fortress. It was announced that the bridge will be occasionally used for the next 7-8 months, but that in 2019 the traffic across the bridge will be discontinued. However, the traffic was effectively discontinued already in the summer of 2018. Within the scopes of the Belgrade Waterfront project, it was planned for the bridge to become a combined pedestrian and bicycle bridge, with coffeehouses and scenic viewpoints.  Importance  It was the first modern bridge in the state. This was the only railway bridge in Belgrade until 1935 when the Bridge of King Peter II, predecessor of the modern Panƒçevo Bridge was built across the Danube, and the only one across the Sava until 1979 when the New Railroad Bridge was open. The first train departing from the Belgrade Main Station in 1884 crossed the bridge, so as the last one in June 2018 to Budapest, before the station was closed.

It is nematophagous, forming loops of hypha to trap nematodes, on which it then feeds. Description The species has a whitish spreading mycelium of branched, hyaline hyphae (thread-like filaments) some 2 to 4 Œºm wide. The conidia (non-motile spores) are borne on specialized stalks called conidiophores which are hyaline, erect and 200 to 550 Œºm long. These taper upwards and expand into a knob-like tip which is a distinguishing feature of this species. The conidia are hyaline, tapering towards the base and 20 to 52 Œºm long. Biology A. dactyloides has the ability to form rings of hypha that can constrict sharply and catch a nematode in the loop. Each ring is a short branch of the hypha containing three cells, separated by three \\"T-shaped\\" areas of cell wall. When stimulated by the movement of a nematode inside the loop (or by heat, or by the tip of a researcher's needle), the three cells inflate suddenly, rather like balloons, and the nematode is trapped in a vice-like grip, its body constricted into two parts. Now branches of hypha invade the nematode on either side of the loop and digest and absorb the soft tissues. Within a few hours the nutrients from these are available to the mycelium of the fungus. Unlike some other species of nematophagous fungi which create sticky nets, A. dactyloides is able to form constricting ring- traps immediately after emerging from the conidia. These are known as conidial traps and may constitute a survival mechanism under adverse conditions. Under normal conditions, a hypha is formed on germination of the conidia; this grows and branches to form a mycelium, and loop traps form on the hyphae in the mycelium. Uses The fungus is being researched for use in biological control of root-knot nematodes. Compared to other nematophagous fungi it is rather slow growing. A. dactyloides has been mass-reared in liquid culture but because it is sensitive to desiccation, it has not been possible to use fast drying procedures. However, this problem has been overcome and it can now be formulated as granules which can be sprinkled on the soil close to plants. In greenhouse experiments it proved up to 96% effective at reducing root-knot nematodes.

Unlike Mother's Day and Father's Day, it is not federally recognized. History The U.S. holiday was originally conceived by Smokey Robinson to honor his relationship with his six daughters. In human development the relationship between fathers and sons overshadows the bond with daughters. This holiday promotes the development of young women through their father. Robinson stated: ‚ÄúThere are many different kinds of families today, and we know that all parental relationships are important to the healthy development of children, but the father/daughter bond is unique and one that is near to my heart. The father/daughter relationship shapes a young woman‚Äôs perspective of men and what to expect from them. I believe that female empowerment begins in the home and fathers must set a healthy example through their personal actions and interactions.‚Äù Celebration Examples of commemoration during Father‚ÄìDaughter Day can be both commercial or intangible. Nonmaterial examples of observances during this day include embracing one another with hugs, spending quality time together, and honoring their presence in your life. In September 2017, Rockabye Baby! Music released a lullaby version of Smokey Robinson's \\"My Girl\\" to support the holiday. In October 2017, greeting card company American Greetings announced their plan to release a line of eCards with Smokey Robinson to celebrate the launch of Father-Daughter Day. Father absence in the United States Fifteen million U.S. children live without a father. While father absence mainly results from parental divorce and separation, other factors such as family poverty, developmental difficulties have been associated with father absence, the effects of which have been explained by various theoretical approaches. Fathers are traditionally deemed a provider of protection and support for the child's development. Early maturing girls have been found to be at risk for teenage pregnancy, drinking and weight problems, and giving birth to low birth weight infants.

Early life Kate Allen Tryon was born in the village of Naples, Maine, on March 18, 1865. She was the daughter of Charles A. Allen, of Portland, Maine. She attended the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Career For three years after their marriage, Tryon's husband was local editor of Portland and Bangor newspapers, and Tryon, as his associate, gained a wide experience in journalism. In the fall of 1889 Tryon's husband was able to fulfill his long-cherished plan of studying at Harvard University and they moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. As member of the staff of the Boston Advertiser and its allied evening paper, the Boston Record, Tryon's name became well-known to the newspaper-readers of New England. In 1891 she lectured upon the subject of New England's wild song-birds, her field being mostly in the scores of literary and educational clubs which abounded in Massachusetts. She supplemented her lectures by illustrations in the shape of water-color drawings of each bird made by herself, showing its characteristic attitude and background. When not actively engaged in newspaper work in Boston, she was especially happy as an interviewer. She first visited Swindon, Wiltshire, in 1910, and she returned 5 other times: \\"The lark, the nightingale and Richard Jefferies ‚Äì those are the three things that brought me to England\\"; the output of these visits is a vast array of paintings. Richard Jefferies (1848‚Äì1887) was a Swindon poet. Personal life In school in Portland she met James Libbey Tryon and became his wife in Massena, New York. She died in 1952. Legacy In 1963 her daughter Sylvia Kramer donated 35 paintings of her mother to the Richard Jefferies Museum at Coate Farmhouse; some of these paintings are now at the Swindon Museum and Art Gallery. In 1997 her granddaughter Kate Schneider donated to the Richard Jefferies Society an unpublished typed manuscript based on Tryon's visits to Swindon.

Due to the location of the tibia, it is frequently injured. Thus it is the most commonly fractured long bone in the body.  Signs and symptoms  Patients with tibial shaft fractures present with pain and localized swelling. Due to the pain they are unable to bear weight. There may be deformity, angulation, or malroation of the leg. Fractures that are open (bone exposed or breaking the skin) are common.  Mechanism  Since approximately one third of the tibia lies directly beneath the skin, open fractures are common compared to other long bones. These open fractures are most commonly caused by high velocity trauma (e.g. motor vehicle collisions), while closed fractures most commonly occur from sports injuries or falls. Osteoporosis can be a contributing factor. Skiing and football (soccer) injuries are also common culprits.  Diagnosis   Examination  Prior to realignment and splinting an assessment is performed to ensure there are no open wounds, soft-tissue contusions, or neurovascular injuries.  Radiography  Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs the include the entire length of the lower leg (knee to ankle) are highly sensitive and specific for tibial shaft fractures.  Classification  Two systems of fracture classification are commonly used to aid diagnosis and management of tibia shaft fractures: * Oestern and Tscherne Classification * Gustilo- Anderson Classification Management is dependent on the determination of whether the fracture is open or closed.  Management   Nonoperative treatment  Nonsurgical treatment of tibia shaft fractures is now limited to closed, stable, isolated, minimally displaced fractures caused by a low-energy mechanism of injury. This treatment consists of application of a long-leg cast.  Operative treatment  Surgical treatment is typically indicated for high-energy trauma fractures. Intramedullary nailing is a common technique, but external fixation may have equivalent outcomes.  Epidemiology  Tibia shaft fractures are the most common long bone fractures. They account for approximately 4% of the fractures seen in the Medicare population.

Early life Pat Boy was born in a small village of Pino Suarez in the municipality of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. He grew up speaking Maya as his first language although he started exploring his indigenous past only when he became older. Growing up, Pat Boy often listened to rap CDs brought home by his older brother. However, he got tired of listening to English and Spanish music and eventually, along with another young rapper, El Cima Atte, decided to start producing rap songs in Maya in the homemade studio of his friend, Jes√∫s Alejandro Cach. Career Pat Boy's first album Mi Primer Paso/In Y√°ax Xinbaal was released in 2011. It immediately gained attention for its Mayan lyrics, although not all the reactions were positive. Some people considered the usage of the traditional language in rap, vulgar or too rebellious. Pat Boy's first hit song was called \\"Sangre Maya\\" (Maya blood) which he did with El Cima Atte. As of 2013, it is one of the most listened-to indigenous rap songs. Pat Boy and El Cima Atte made several other rap songs together, mostly in Mayan, before the latter's 2014 death from cancer. In 2017, Pat Boy and singer Yazm√≠n Novelo released the song \\"X√≠imbal Kaaj\\" (Walkers of the land), which was produced by labels 4 Mayan Seasons and Jabu Studio. The song and the music video were praised for the visuals and upbeat message regarding indigenous identity. Influences and themes Pat Boy says that his main motivation is to make people proud of their Maya culture and for the young to not be ashamed of using their language. Most of Pat Boy's songs focus on the struggles and traditions of Maya life. Some songs such as \\"k¬¥axil ts¬¥√≠imin\\" have environmental messages, while other songs such as \\"La Perlita\\" have Christian themes. Pat Boy says that his favorite rappers and influences are 50 Cent, Lil Wayne and Cam'ron.

It was built to the designs of James Lockyer in 1842 after a medicinal spring was discovered on the site four years earlier. The building closed as a pump room in the early 1850s and was used for other purposes, including a Baptist chapel, billiard hall, and a clothing factory; the pump room is now in private ownership. History Robert Clay and his wife, Letitia,Benton, p. 297. an ageing couple from Cheltenham, retired to Hockley in Essex, in 1838. The Clays, who had been users of Cheltenham's natural waters, rented a cottage and dug a water well in its garden. Letitia, a chronic asthmatic, found relief in drinking the water and declared it to be medicinal; they renamed their cottage Hockley Spa Lodge. In order to capitalise on their discovery, and to emulate the kind of success that spas in Bath and Royal Tunbridge Wells had, they sought advise from a local businessman, William Summersall, who later became the manager of the spa, on how to build a pumping room to access larger amounts of water for the wider public.Hembry, pp. 95‚Äì96. On Summersall's advice, they invited Dr. A. B Granville, an author who become notable for his many books on the medicinal properties of the world's natural spas, to test the water.\\"Hockley Spa Pump Room open\\", The Bury and Norwich Post, 14 Jun 1843, p. 2. Granville was impressed and sent the samples to Sir Richard Phillips, a leading authority on natural consumables. It was Granville's mention of Hockley Spa in his book, The Spas of England, that brought Hockley's waters to national interest.\\"Hockley Spa Pump Room\\", The Essex County Standard, 16 Jun 1843, p. 2. The Pump Room, c.1910 The Clays appointed the London-based architect James Lockyer (1796‚Äì1875)The Pump Room, Hockley Spa, Essex: perspective view, RIBA archive, accessed 8 May 2019. to design a pumping room, which was completed in 1842. Lockyer designed it in the Italian style. Inside, there was wainscot panelling with oak features. The tables were made of marble and rosewood and the walls had gold leaf detailing. The chimney pieces were marble. The pump was located in a circular recess opposite the landing and was made mostly of satinwood and glass. It was mounted on a veined marble table and had a yellow glass handle and silver spout. The foundation stone was laid at the back of the pump in the head of the recess.\\"Hockley Spa Pump Room description\\", The Bristol Mercury and Daily Post, 1 Jul 1843, p. 7.

The Clay's spa business flourished and the water became so much in demand that it was sent to a depot in Jewin Street, Cripplegate, London, where it was bottled and distributed to other countries.\\"Hockley Spa\\", The Morning Post, 2 May 1844, p. 8.\\"Hockley Spa Bottled Water 1843\\", London Age, 11 June 1843, p. 6.

It is the ruin of a hill castle.R√∂misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz (publ.): F√ºhrer zu vor- und fr√ºhgeschichtlichen Denkm√§lern - Das Osnabr√ºcker Land III, Vol. 44, Verlag Philipp von Zabern, Mainz, 1979, pp.122ff It was the third hill castle in Osnabr√ºck Land along with the Iburg and the Wittekindsburg near Rulle.  History  The Holter Burg was the family seat of the lords of Holte. Their most important representatives were Wigbold of Holte, Archbishop of Cologne and Arch-Chancellor of the Empire, the Essen prince-abbess, Beatrice of Holte, and the bishops of M√ºnster, Burchard of Holte, William I of Holte and Ludolf of Holte. The castle was probably initially destroyed as early as 1147 by the Bishop of Osnabr√ºck, Philip of Katzenelnbogen (1141 to 1173), and the counts of Ravensberg in a feud with the lords of Holte. It may have been destroyed for the last time between 1308 and 1315, although the latest archaeological investigations suggest an earlier date, because a fire layer found in the ground dates the mid-13th century. Schloss Ledenburg in the municipality of Nemden (part of Bissendorf) was built as the \\"New\\" Holter Burg.  Description  The Holter Burg was initially built as a tower castle on a plateau with a diameter of around 50 metres located on a rocky hill spur. It was guarded by a section of moat with a roughly 20-metre-wide and up to 10-metre-deep ditch. A roughly 2-metre-thick enceinte protected the castle. In the east the height difference between the top of the wall and the bed of the moat was around 16 metres. In the west there was no moat due to the steep hillside. The castle's first building stage, probably around 1100, consisted of the mighty round tower and the enceinte. Later, a castle chapel and palas were added. Today only wall remains may be seen along with the plan of a round tower. The deep moats may also be made out. Within the double ditch system, the site has an area of about 5,000 square metres. In 1997 and 2006 there were archaeological excavations and safety measures in order to preserve the castle and make it attractive for visitors.

It was built in 1688, spanning across the Sava river.  History  The Greek historian Zosimus mentions the bridge in Belgrade (at that time, Singidunum) already in the 5th century, which is the oldest historical mention of any bridges in the city. Other historical records observe other bridges, like in 1521, 1595 or 1717, but they were all temporary, pontoon bridges, constructed solely for the purpose of conquering the city during the numerous battles and sieges of Belgrade in history.  Location  The bridge was constructed further to the south from the city, near the village of Ostru≈ænica on ≈†umadija side of the river. As the Syrmian side across the Sava was a vast marsh at the time (modern New Belgrade), the bridge didn't stop at the bank but continued for some length above the swamp. Because of that, the people also called it the Bridge above the marsh (Most preko moƒçvare).  Construction  1688 Siege of Belgrade Just like all the previous temporary bridges, the Long Bridge was also built by the Austrians to help them conquer Belgrade from the Ottomans during the 1688 Siege of Belgrade. According to the records, a seasoned Belgrade master craftsman ƒêorƒëeviƒá \\"in only one month, with the help of his 400 workers, built the Long Bridge, using 2,000 tree trunks, 1,100 wooden piles, 15,500 bundles of palings and 12,000 palisade pickets.\\"  Demolition  If not before, the bridge had to be demolished by 1691 when the Ottomans reconquered Belgrade.  Importance  The Long Bridge is the first permanent bridge in Belgrade history. Right next to it, bit closer to the island of Ada Ciganlija, the Austrians constructed another, classical pontoon bridge, which \\"leaned on the Long Bridge\\". Maps show another pontoon bridge, on the boats, directly connecting the road from Zemun to the Belgrade Fortress.Map of Zemun 1688  References  Bridges completed in 1688 Buildings and structures in Belgrade Bridges in Belgrade Bridges over the Sava in Serbia ","title":"Long Bridge, Belgrade"},{"id":"55409768","text":"Rosa Castillo Araujo (born 14 February 1956 in Barcelona) is a former Spanish women's basketball player, member of the Spain women's basketball team.

Club career  Rosa Castillo played in the Spanish League for 18 years, winning 11 League titles and 11 Cup titles.

It consists in a virtual gallery and a virtual archive containing background information about the female sex and femininity. Various representations of female sexual organs indicate the existence of a female role model in social systems and allow conclusions to be drawn as to the importance of women in different environments. This project aims at promoting the artistic creation and debate about the female sex. It supports the positive meanings and appreciation of the words and body parts such as the vagina, vulva, and clitoris. The museum is considered the first to be devoted to the vagina.  About  The Vaginamuseum communicates informations and is an educational platform. Experts of art history, health care, medical science, as well as artists of all disciplines, are creating this platform. The archive displays conceptual and historical texts and other articles and contributions about the vagina, the vulva and the clitoris. The curated gallery shows selected artworks which stimulate new thinking about the female genital and lead to new perspectives. Rajnar's vision is that the museum can help improve people's negative attitudes about the vagina which are shaped through culture and media. The Vaginamuseum elaborated concepts on the topic: Art and Culture and Life and Limb _ the positive Power of Feminity. Vaginamuseum is registered at the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO).  Exhibitions in the gallery   Vagina 2.0  The virtual opening exhibition curated by the media artist and curator Doris Jauk-Hinz broaches the issue of current terms and subjective meanings of the female sexual organs. Reflections in dealing with the term vagina are based on ideas, expectations, attributions, associations and emotions by means of art. The artistic inputs range from earlier depictions of vulva symbols in different civilizations and times to the life and work on social media platforms and sex-positive feminism in cyberspace.

The artistic contributions address natural and artificial processes that create life within a cultural dynamic. They depict desires for the composition of ‚Äúcreation‚Äú and range from the metaphoric realization in artistic processes to the ‚Äúself-design‚Äú of life. Articles on the topic of birth complete the exhibition.

It gives an overview of the depiction of the female sex starting from the European Paleolithic up to present day art. The texts about different periods serve as an introduction to offer information on the political and cultural events of the time, on the women's role and stilistic characteristics relating to art. Around 100 art works of particular periods were chosen to exemplify particular times. They illustrate the style of the period and serve as documents for particular stages of development.  Vaginalogy  This contribution was developed by the physician Jana Studnicka. It offers insights into the topics of woman, body, sexuality and society. Not only medical, but also social and psychological aspects of femininity are discussed. The content changes between gender identity, sexual orientation, external and internal female sexual organs, contraception, reproduction, menstruation, sexual medicine, violence against women, etc. This contribution reflects the current state of research as well as different perspectives on various issues and problem areas. It clarifies present thought patterns and presents the latest scientific insights. The newly created term Vaginalogy doesn't yet exist in the general language and consists of the word Vagina and the suffix -logy. The idea was to set a counterpoint to the medical term gynecology. Because gynecology is primarily concerned with the teaching of the diseases of the female body.  Press  In 2014, the Jetzt-Magazin of the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung published an interview with Kerstin Rajnar and with Hjortur Gisli Sigurdsson, director of the Icelandic Phallological Museum in Reykjav√≠k. In the interview Rajnar reported that the Vaginamuseum had been heavily criticized even before the opening, also because of state funding. Stephanie Johne wrote on the website Refinery29: \\"Gender paradigms must be questioned critically and overcome once and for all. The virtual Vaginamuseum makes a crucial contribution to a more positive perception of the female sex, to such a degree as art contributes to its acceptance on a broader level. This is why its online presence determines its offline presence at the end of the day!\\"  Financing  The bilingual Vaginamuseum, translated by Christine Wilhelm is supported by the art department of the Austrian government, the Cultural Department of Styria, the Department for Women, anti-discrimination and equal treatment of Burgenland and by the cities of Vienna and Graz.

Edmonton police constable Mike Chernyk was hit and stabbed by 30-year-old Abdulahi Sharif, who then struck four pedestrians with a rental truck during a police chase. All four injured survived and were hospitalized. The incident was investigated as a possible Islamist terrorist attack, with police confirming the presence of an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant flag in the van that rammed the police officer. Sharif was convicted of eleven criminal charges including five counts of attempted murder, but was not charged with terrorism-related offenses. Attack and pursuit On September 30, 2017, a military appreciation night football game between the Edmonton Football Team and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers was being held. During the game, a driver deliberately rammed into Edmonton police constable Mike Chernyk, who was standing between a barricade and his police car near Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton at around 8:15 p.m. After exiting his car, the driver stabbed Chernyk before fleeing the scene. Around midnight, a U-Haul rental truck was pulled over at a police checkpoint on Wayne Gretzky Drive and 112 Avenue during a manhunt. After officers identified the driver as Chernyk's attacker, he drove off with a dozen police vehicles in pursuit. While fleeing police, the man drove into four pedestrians, two of them in an alleyway near 109 Street and Jasper Avenue, and the other two near 107 Street and Jasper Avenue. Eventually, the rental truck was PIT maneuvered by police at the intersection of 107 Street and 100 Avenue, and the driver was arrested. Police investigated the incident as an act of terrorism. Victims The first victim of the attack, Edmonton police constable Mike Chernyk, faced several injuries, including stab wounds to his face and hands. He was released from the hospital the following day, returned to work 18 days later, and has claimed things have \\"returned to normal\\". The four pedestrians hit by the rental truck suffered various injuries ranging from \\"broken arms to brain bleeds\\". Two of them were released from the hospital after treatment the following day. Of the remaining two still hospitalized, one was upgraded from critical condition to stable, and the other suffered a fractured skull but has since regained consciousness. Perpetrator The perpetrator, 30-year-old Abdulahi Hasan Sharif,Huffington Post: Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, Edmonton Suspect, Was Ordered To Leave U.S. In 2011 is a Somali national and refugee. In 2011, Sharif was detained by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for four months pending deportation to Somalia. He was released with an \\"order of supervision\\", but in January 2012, ICE lost track of him. He subsequently claimed refugee status in Canada. He was reported by a colleague to the Police after he expressed his hatred for Shia Muslims, polytheists, and expressed support for the Islamic State, which led the RCMP and Edmonton police to investigate him in 2015 for extremism, and was deemed \\"not a threat\\". He was arrested for offenses including participation in a terrorist attack, commission of an offence for a terrorist group, five counts of attempted murder, dangerous driving, criminal flight causing bodily harm, and possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose. However, the Crown did not lay any terrorism-related charges against Sharif. In 2019, Sharif was put on trial for eleven criminal charges: five counts of attempted murder, four counts of criminal flight from police causing bodily harm, one count of aggravated assault and one count of dangerous driving. He pled not guilty to all charges, but was ultimately convicted on all eleven offenses. During the trial, he did not retain legal counsel, did not testify in his own defence, or call any witnesses. On December 13, 2019, Sharif was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 28 years, found entitled to 3.3 years of pre-sentence credit, leaving 24.7 years to serve. Responses Domestic The attack was quickly condemned by Edmonton mayor Don Iveson, who expressed shock and sadness, thanking first responders and urging citizens to remain calm. Alberta premier Rachel Notley, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, also condemned the attacks and praised efforts of first responders. Many other politicians issued statements condemning the attacks. Naheed Nenshi, the mayor of Calgary, Alberta condemned the attack, calling it a \\"terrible act of violence and hatred\\", and expressed Calgary's solidarity with Edmonton. The National Council of Canadian Muslims condemned the attack. International * : The White House issued a statement on October 1 condemning the attack, with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders describing the attack as \\"cowardly\\" and wished victims \\"a speedy and full recovery\\". Vice President Mike Pence condemned the attack expressed his condolences to the people of Edmonton on Twitter, stating, \\"Our hearts and prayers are with the victims & the people of Edmonton & we condemn the cowardly terror attacks that occurred late last night.\\" See also *Terrorism in Canada *Air India Flight 182 *2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa References 2017 crimes in Canada 2017 in Alberta 2017 road incidents 2017 attack Crime in Edmonton Road incidents in Canada September 2017 crimes in North America Stabbing attacks in 2017 Terrorist incidents in Canada Terrorist incidents involving vehicular attacks Vehicular rampage in Canada ISIL terrorist incidents in Canada Terrorist incidents in Canada in the 2010s Terrorist incidents in North America in 2017 ","title":"2017 Edmonton attack"},{"id":"55409883","text":"Xie Shouchang (; 19 November 1897 ‚Äì 22 December 1971) known by his courtesy name Xie Guansheng () was a Chinese jurist who served as Minister of Justice from 1937 to 1948.

Canales. The purpose of the hearing was to \\"investigate the activities and necessity for a continuance of the force.\\" The investigations surfaced several allegations of wrongdoing, from murder to intimidation charges, with varying degrees of evidence. The committee absolved the Texas Rangers of all legal wrongdoing while acknowledging a track record of abuse, and commended the adjutant general of the Texas Rangers. Nonetheless, the investigation sparked internal reform of the Texas Rangers aimed to increase professionalism and accountability. Background The 1910 Mexican Revolution had raised tensions along the border of Texas and Mexico. Immigration into the southern US states from Mexico rose, with nearly one million Mexicans entering the United States at the turn of the century. Land redistribution efforts in Mexico made Anglo- Americans nervous about disputed land claims between the United States and Mexico. This tension, mixed with fears that Mexico would side with Germany in the first World War, created extraordinary tension on the border. Texas Governor James Edward Ferguson nearly doubled the size of the ranger force, from 13 to 24 men, from 1913 to 1916. With rumors of an organized insurrection and word of the Mexican insurrectionist Plan de San Diego spread, the governor declared a punishment of execution of insurrectionists. The Texas Rangers thus began a campaign of racial profiling and ethnic violence against Mexicans in Texas. One Texas judge, James Wells, estimated in later testimony that Texas officers and vigilantes were responsible for the executions of up to 300 Mexican men in just two counties. The Texas Rangers and hundreds of other temporary military police known as \\"Loyalty Rangers\\" may have killed between 300 and 5,000 Mexican and Tejano men through 1919. Widespread claims of abuse of authority and vigilantism would spark the investigation of the Texas Rangers by Jose Tomas Canales in 1919. House Bill 5 Representative J. T. Canales, the only Hispanic state lawmaker in Texas at the time, introduced legislation to regulate Ranger activity after being threatened by a Ranger, Frank Hamer, in the course of an investigation. Canales wrote a formal letter to Texas Governor William P. Hobby, who promised an investigation. Hamer was forced to apologize but was not removed. Following the incident, Canales introduced legislation, House Bill 5, which would, among other measures, limit the number of Texas Rangers to 24 officers, increase pay and professionalism (with requirements for age and prior service). It also called for Rangers to hand over prisoners to local authorities immediately, rather than detain them. Discussion of the bill inspired heated and emotional rhetoric in defense of the Rangers, with Canales making charges that the group was responsible for the abuse of prisoners and a number of murders. During the debate, Adjutant General James A. Harley intervened to request an investigation into the \\"motives that actuate men to make complaint,\\" intending an investigation into Canales and those who were perceived as impugning the reputation of the Ranger Force, but also to articulate a final argument in defense of the force's existence. Charges Photograph of Brite Ranch, near Marfa, Texas, circa 1918, shows the ranch headquarters complex and a small two story fort (at right) built for Texas Rangers to protect against Mexican raiders The hearings, which convened on January 31, 1919, were formally \\"The Joint Committee of the Senate and the House in the Investigation of the Texas Ranger Force.\\" It included two state senators and three state representatives, and was chaired by Lubbock representative W.H. Bledsoe. The panel heard from 80 witnesses over 12 days of testimony amounting to 1,605 printed pages. The defense, on the side of the Rangers, was represented by former legislator Robert E. Lee Knight and Texas Cattle Ranchers Association Attorney Dayton Moses. The defense focused on the mental health of Canales, arguing that he suffered delusions. Canales, on the offense, introduced six charges, which would swell to 19 charges, many of which were vague and worded in ways that would be impossible to prove. Canales proposed that support for the Texas Rangers was a result of German propaganda, designed to inflame tensions against Mexico to distract the United States from entering World War I. Many witnesses testified with both acknowledgment and ambivalence to the Rangers' acts of violence. One, Judge James B. Wells, testified both that he believed Rangers were responsible for a mass murder of 11 Mexican men whose corpses he had personally discovered on the side of the road in a state of decay. Nonetheless, he testified, \\"I thought it was my duty and I never took a cent of compensation. Defended several for murder.\\" Massacre The Porvenir massacre was an incident on January 28, 1918 in Presidio County, Texas in which the Rangers and local ranchers killed 15 Mexican villagers. The Texas Rangers Company B was sent to the area to stop banditry after the Brite Ranch raid. However, despite having no evidence that the Porvenir villagers were involved, witnesses testified that ‚ÄúAmerican soldiers, Rangers, and Texas Ranchmen‚Äù executed fifteen men. Porvenir resident Rosenda Mega testified that the Rangers \\"took them about one-quarter of a mile from said ranch, and then in a very cowardly manner, and without examining any of them, shot them.‚Äù Murder Canales highlighted the murder of Lisandro Mu√±oz and the disappearance of Florencio Garcia. Canales had brought the murder of Lisandro Mu√±oz to the committee, charging that Ranger John J. Edds had murdered Mu√±oz on October 6, 1918. Edds admitted he had entered the home of a deserter without a warrant, and that he was overpowered by Mu√±oz, arguing that the murder was in self-defense. Regarding Florencio Garcia, two rangers had taken Garcia into custody for a theft investigation. The next day they let Garcia go, and were last seen escorting him on a mule. Garcia was never seen again. A month after the interrogation, bones and Garcia's clothing were found beside the road where the Rangers claimed to have let Garcia go. The Rangers were arrested for murder, freed on bail, and acquitted due to lack of evidence. Another murder investigation lead one Ranger to confess to collecting $10 a week from brothels and bars, on order of the city marshal. The case had been addressed but the charges previously dismissed as lacking evidence. The Ranger resigned. During the trial, two rangers became intoxicated and shot each other during a poker game with four other rangers and two women, resulting in one fatality. The officers were all discharged, and the committee decided it would not invite witnesses to testify or hear further details of the incident. Intimidation The counsel also heard the testimony of Jesus Villareal, who testified that two Rangers had pistol-whipped him, suffocated him, put a gun into his mouth and planned to plant evidence unless he confessed to the crime of transporting Mexican immigrants across the border. Canales acknowledged he had no further evidence for this charge aside from the testimony. Another Ranger admitted to pistol-whipping an attorney in a courtroom in Falfurrias, while testimony of waitstaff from the San Francisco Cafe in San Antonio suggested that a Ranger had pistol-whipped a waiter. Canales acknowledged that the Ranger had been dismissed, but suggested that evidence had been tampered with to suggest he had been dismissed prior to the incident with the waiter. Canales also argued that he had anonymous testimony from dozens of claimants, whom he would not reveal, who claimed that they had not brought charges against Rangers for known misbehavior because they had no faith that the crimes would not simply be covered up. Canales argued mostly of his own experience being threatened by Hamer, and argued that Hamer should have been dismissed for threatening an elected official, rather than simply asked to apologize. The committee had little concern with Hamer's behavior, and openly mocked Canales, asking whether Hamer \\"should go into hiding\\" whenever Canales came to Austin. Leadership failures Canales argued that repeated Ranger violations of state statutes under Harley were cause for Harley's dismissal and replacement. The committee ruled that this was beyond the scope of their investigation. Harley responded to Canales' allegation with a vulgar statement accusing Canales' of trying to sodomize the Rangers. The charge was dismissed. Conclusions The committee disbanded on February 13. On February 18, it issued a verdict absolving the Rangers of wrongdoing and suggested the force be allowed to continue, despite supporting the claim that Garcia had been murdered by agents, and other evidence of \\"gross violation of both civil and criminal laws.‚Äù It argued that the Rangers had violated the laws in searching homes without warrants and that it had illegally seized firearms. Nonetheless, it offered praise to General Harley, head of the Ranger Force, declaring him \\"entitled to the commendation of the Senate and House for the able, efficient, impartial, and fearless manner in which he has discharged the duties placed upon him.\\" The committee backed Canales' bill, calling for a reduction of the force and higher pay. The House scratched Canales' proposal in favor of a new bill which raised pay, set a cap of 75 Rangers, and otherwise reinforced existing laws; it passed 87‚Äì10 with Canales in the minority opposition. Nonetheless, the bill was collectively referred to as \\"the Canales reforms,\\" though they bore little resemblance to Canales' proposal. Reforms The so-called Canales Reforms introduced a smaller force with higher pay standards and a minimum and maximum age requirement for Rangers. It opened a process for filing formal complaints against Ranger misdeeds, which would be directed to the adjutant general of the Rangers; this was a formalization of the process that had already existed. The Rangers were reorganized into four companies of 16 Rangers, each with one captain, and one headquarters with six men and a captain. Internally, the Rangers voluntarily adopted increased bureaucracy, requiring daily scout reports and identification badges. A code of conduct was introduced, forbidding drinking, gambling, obscene language and public criticism of fellow Rangers; guns could be worn but were to be hidden in public areas when off duty.

Additional terms with nuanced meanings include viewing,Madeline Harrison Caviness, Visualizing Women in the Middle Ages: Sight, Spectacle, and Scopic Economy (2001), p. 18. watching,John Mowitt, Sounds: The Ambient Humanities (2015), p. 3. eyeing,Charles John Smith, Synonyms Discriminated: A Complete Catalogue of Synonymous Words in the English Language (1871), p. 100-01. observing,Ty Clement, Being Ourself (2009), p. 25. beholding, and scanning. Looking is both a physical act of directing the focus of the eyes, and a psychological act of interpreting what is seen and choosing whether to continue looking at it, or to look elsewhere. Where more than one person is involved, looking may lead to eye contact between those doing the looking, which raises further implications for the relationship established through that act. Looking versus seeing \\"Looking\\" and \\"seeing\\" are traditionally contrasted in a number of ways, although their usage often overlaps. Looking can be characterized as \\"the action precedent to seeing\\". Any kind of looking or viewing actually implies \\"seeing\\" certain things within the range of view, while not \\"seeing\\" others, because they are unimportant at the moment. Thus, things that are within the range of view, but which are unimportant to the viewer, may be treated by the brain as if they are transparent, by being looked over, past, and around.Mark Changizi, The Vision Revolution: How the Latest Research Overturns Everything We Thought We Knew About Human Vision (2010), p. 75. The distinction between \\"looking\\" and \\"seeing\\" has been compared to the distinction between hearing and listening, with one being a rote activity and the other requiring a conscious and thoughtful effort to understand what is being seen or heard.Jonathan R√©e, I See a Voice: Deafness, Language and the Senses--A Philosophical History (1999). p. 52.Frances Guerin, On Not Looking: The Paradox of Contemporary Visual Culture (2015), p. 35. Because of the breadth and flexibility of both words, different authors may reverse the relationship in contrasting them, with one suggesting that a person can \\"look at\\" something without truly \\"seeing\\" it, while another might suggest that a person might be \\"seeing\\" something, but not truly \\"look at\\" it.See, e.g., Damian Hine, David Carson, Innovative Methodologies in Enterprise Research (2007), p. 19: \\"Looking but not seeing; hearing but not listening; speaking but not communicating; touching but not feeling; smelling but not detecting. In many ways our senses play tricks on us\\".Frances Guerin, On Not Looking: The Paradox of Contemporary Visual Culture (2015), p. 35: \\"[James] Elkins bemoans the tendency to not look, to look without seeing, and in its place proposes ways of looking\\".R. G. Gordon, Personality (2005), p. 277: \\"Apart from the actual presence of the sensation, perception is markedly deficient or totally absent, the idiot sees but does not look, hears but does not listen, and feels touch and pain but does not refer them in space and time\\".Evan Marshall, Eye Language: Understanding the Eloquent Eye (1983), p. 82: \\"In simple terms, the schizophrenic sees but does not look ‚Äî contrary to the popular belief that schizophrenics do not see their surroundings\\". Both arrangements suggest that the person is directing their vision towards the thing, but failing to give sufficient attention to notice specific characteristics or implications of what is in the visual field. Looking in intense, pronounced, or prolonged ways A number of troponyms exist to illustrate kinds of looking that are either intentionally or unconsciously done in intense, pronounced, or prolonged ways. \\"Staring\\" is an intense form of looking in which the eyes of the person looking remain fixed on the subject for an extended period, and is generally considered rude. \\"Gazing\\" has historically implied intensity, but not aggressiveness, and may imply \\"wonder, fascination, awe, or admiration\\".Pamela B. DeVinne, The Right Word III: A Concise Thesaurus (1990), p. 88. In the twentieth century, however, sociologists began to use the term to suggest a power relationship between the person who is gazing and the subject of the gaze, with the former exercising an ability to define the latter. By contrast, glaring does suggest aggressiveness and confrontation.Emil Coccaro, Aggression: Psychiatric Assessment and Treatment (2003), p. 98. \\"Eyeing\\" implies looking at something with some feeling involved, such as desire or wariness. \\"Observing\\" implies looking at a specific object or area for a prolonged period specifically for purposes of observation, with the purpose of looking specifically being to obtain information about the thing being observed without necessarily either judging it or interfering with it. \\"Watching\\" implies a similar prolonged focus, but can also imply looking at something in a distracted or absentminded manner, such as watching television. \\"Gaping\\" and \\"gawking\\" also indicate prolonged acts of looking, but suggest that the person doing the looking is so mentally distracted by the subject being observed that they become unaware of their own conduct. At the extreme, rubbernecking is the physical act of craning one's neck, performed in order to get a better view, and has been described as a human trait that is associated with morbid curiosity. \\"Ogling\\" is an \\"impertinent\\" form of staring \\"often in a way that indicates improper interest\\". Looking in quick, subtle, or hidden ways A number of troponyms exist to illustrate kinds of looking that are either intentionally or unconsciously done in a quick, subtle, or hidden way. \\"Glancing\\" and \\"glimpsing\\" are terms that imply looking at things in a subtle way, or seeing things very briefly before they move out of the range of vision. Although the two are often confused, a glance is more commonly a quick movement of the eye, whereas a glimpse is more often a result of the object being watched quickly moving out of sight.Sol Steinmetz, Semantic Antics: How and Why Words Change Meaning (2009), p. 84-85. \\"Scanning\\" suggests quickly looking over an area \\"to get a general impression\\", accomplished \\"by rapidly noting one point after another\\". Glance appeared as a word prior to 1450, from Old French glacer or glacier, a reference to the quick movement of slipping on ice, and was first recorded as appearing with its current meaning in 1582. Glimpse appeared as a noun with its current meaning in 1580, from Middle English glimsen, and as a verb in 1779, although it was originally associated with seeing bright or shiny things. Playwright Eugene O'Neill was fond of using glance as a stage direction. \\"Peeking\\" and \\"peeping\\" suggest looking at something that one is not supposed to be looking at, and doing so in a way that is intended to hide the fact that the person doing the peeking or peeping is looking. There is \\"an illegitimacy associated with peeping\\".Tracy B. Strong, \\"On Religion and the Strangeness of Speech\\", in Corey McCall, Tom Nurmi, Melville among the Philosophers (2017), p. 110. An aspect of the story of Lady Godiva is Peeping Tom ‚Äî a tailor who spied on Godiva as she rode naked through her town to protest taxation ‚Äî and subsequently was punished. Peeping \\"is in close relation to 'Peeking' ‚Äî one peeps typically at sexual matters and 'peeks' when one wants surreptitiously to know what something is without being seen\\".

He was the secretary general of the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT) from 1971 to 1988. He was dismissive of strike actions and supported a more equal division of labour. Early life Edmond Maire was born on 24 January 1931 in √âpinay-sur-Seine near Paris. His father was a railroad employee for the SNCF at the Gare du Nord, and his mother was a housewife. He was raised as a devout Roman Catholic alongside six siblings. Maire was educated at the Coll√®ge-lyc√©e Jacques-Decour in Paris and did not go to university. He began working at 18 and took evening classes in chemistry at the Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers. He subsequently did his military service. Career Maire began his career as a chemist for Pechiney in Aubervilliers near Paris. He quit his job to focus on activism. After he retired from the CFDT, he became the chief executive of Villages Vacances Familles, a chain of affordable holiday villages later known as Belambra Clubs. Activism Maire first joined the French Confederation of Christian Workers in 1954. In 1964, he was a co-founder of a secular splinter group, the French Democratic Confederation of Labour. Maire succeeded Eug√®ne Descamps as the secretary general of the CFDT from 1971 to 1988. He took on a more centrist approach, which led more left-wing labour leaders like Jacques Julliard to criticize him. For example, Maire dismissed strike actions as \\"old labour mythology.\\" Instead, he was a proponent of a more equal division of labour. In 1981, he complained that French public intellectuals were not sufficiently supportive of his efforts. He was succeeded by Jean Kaspar. Maire joined the Socialist Party in 1974. He was close to Pierre Mend√®s France, Michel Rocard and Jacques Delors. He was a supporter of the 35-hour workweek passed by the Socialist government under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in 2000. Death and legacy Maire died on 1 October 2017. One of his sons, Jacques Maire, is a member of the National Assembly for En Marche!

In 1848 he served as Honorary Secretary to the Cambridge Architectural Society.Songs of Christian chivalry, etc. He received the degree of BA in 1849, and MA in 1852. In 1849 he was ordained as a deacon at Chichester in West Sussex and as a priest in 1850. Fellow of College of St Nicolas Between 1849 and 1852 he was an assistant master and a Fellow of the Society of the College of St Nicolas, at Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, a college of 17 priests founded in 1848 by Nathaniel Woodard, a member of the Oxford Movement and curate of Shoreham-by- Sea, who in that year also founded \\"Shoreham Grammar School\\". This was a fellowship of priests formed with the vision of founding \\"one middle-class school in every diocese\\". The College of St Nicolas later became Lancing College. He left in 1852 having been rebuked by Woodard for \\"a flagrant piece of insubordination\\", whereupon he determined to found his own school where he could manage things according to his own more extreme Anglo-Catholic ideals, including the requirement for systematic and regular confession. Founds Bloxham School In January 1853 Hewett was appointed curate to Rev. J. Hodgson, the Anglo-Catholic vicar of Bloxham, in Oxfordshire. His main responsibility was to serve the small dilapidated medieval chapel at nearby Milcombe, where in February 1853 he founded his school, which he named All Saints' Grammar School,Smith, p.4Old Bloxhamist Society, 'J. W. Hewett:1853-1857', A History of Bloxham School (H.E. Boddy & Co. Ltd, Banbury, 1978), 1-12. also known as \\"Hewett's School\\". His plan was ambitious as he intended the school to be \\"the same to the poorer clergy and gentry as Radley & Bradfield are to the richer\\".Smith, p.8 The school was supported by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, a member of the Oxford Movement who shared his interest in education, who commissioned the diocesan architect George Edmund Street to draw up plans for the new school buildings.Sherwood & Pevsner, The Buildings of England: Oxfordshire (Penguin Books Ltd, 1974), p. 480-1. Street's design was described by The Gentleman's Magazine as the 'most beautiful modern Gothic buildings ever devoted in England to a scholastic purpose'. The foundation stone was blessed by Wilberforce on 7 June 1855. Hewett's plans were for a school for 100 commoners, 40 scholars and an unspecified number of choristers. In February 1855 a trust for the school was established, naming it \\"All Saints' Grammar School\\", with the intent of providing for \\"the liberal education of the sons of the clergy, gentry, Naval, Military and professional men and others\\". Unknown to the trustees, Hewett was at that time personally insolvent, which made the trust legally invalid, and later allowed his creditors to seize the school's assets.Smith, p.9 Hewett contributed his own extensive library and the bulk of the funds for the ambitious building project. He was not however a wealthy man, but had recently inherited a modest legacy from his mother, which he invested in the project. It is said that he gave the impression to his business associates and prospective creditors that he was a man of substantial personal means, which persuaded them to trust him.Smith, pp.4,6 Bankruptcy Having incurred large debts due to his extravagance and poor business acumen, on 27 February 1857 Hewett filed a petition for bankruptcy, following a meeting of his creditors, including his builder and several local tradesmen, a week before in Banbury where his debts were reckoned at about ¬£5,300. The school had failed to attract sufficient numbers of pupils, whom he had expected to pay unusually high fees. Hewett's school, with several dozen pupils and incomplete buildings, was closed in April 1857. The school trust approached Nathaniel Woodard for help, but he refused to support the school. By 1859 the school had been \\"broken up\\" and in the autumn of that year the property was due to be sold by auction, but was purchased and resurrected by Rev. Philip Reginald Egerton, then a curate of nearby Deddington,Smith, History of Bloxham School, Preface who successfully refounded the school, today surviving as Bloxham School. Later career The failure of his school totally ruined him and he \\"went forth as literally bare as the bailiffs could wish\\". He later admitted: \\"I was too sanguine. Too blindly sanguine. I ought to have known it was impossible. I ought to have known that no promise of success justified incurring debt, especially on so large a scale, or the involving friends, though I am sure I never reckoned that they would be losers by me'.Smith, p.11 After his bankruptcy, he managed to obtain successive posts as curate in various parishes until 1874 when he was appointed Senior Classical Master in the North London College School, a girls' school founded in 1850, which post he retained until 1878. Marriage and children He married in about 1855 and had 4 children.Smith, p.12 Death & assessment He died on 20 April 1886 at Claybrooke, near Lutterworth in Leicestershire. In 1907 one of his friends, Rev. W. D. Macray wrote of him in connection with his venture of Bloxham School: :\\"He had great enthusiasm but he had not some of the other qualities necessary for carrying out such a work. In faith he gave literally his all and died poor, disheartened, and what the world would perhaps call a failure\\". However the present school does acknowledge that: :\\"In spite of all, however, the School is there and but for his devotion would never have been. Hewett chose its name and its motto, both of which are still in use. He chose and bought the site and erected there the first range of school buildings, in stone and built by one of the best Victorian architects. Still today it is the most prominent school building seen from the main road approaching the school, and most boys have entered the school for the first time through its doorway \\" List of works Antiquarian works *Remarks on the Monumental Brasses and Certain Decorative Remains in the Cathedral Church of St Peter, Exeter, to which is Appended a Complete Monumentarium, (a full listing of monuments and transcription of inscriptions in Exeter Cathedral), published in Transactions of the Exeter Diocesan Architectural Society, Volume 3, Exeter, 1846-9, pp. 90‚Äì138 *Editor of The Sealed Copy of the Prayer Book, 1848; *A Brief History and Description of the Cathedral Church of St Peter, Exeter.

The painting measures and is displayed at the Gare de l'Est railway station in Paris, where it is suspended some high on a wall in the Hall d'Alsace. Herter's work was intended as a memorial to his elder son Everit, also a painter, who volunteered to join the US Army in September 1917, some months after the US joined the First World War. Everit Herter joined the camouflage section of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Sergeant Herter was killed in June 1918 near Ch√¢teau-Thierry in Aisne, while serving in France with the American Expeditionary Force, and is buried in the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery. He had spent time in Europe with his parents before the war, including a period studying at a secondary school in France. Herter channelled his grief into this mural, which depicts many poilus (French infantrymen) leaving for the Western Front. Over 3 million French citizens were mobilised in the summer of 1914, and many left from this hall at the Gare de l'Est. The upper half of the frieze shows young men in uniform on the train awaiting departure. One to the right carries the French tricolour, and the young man at centre, holding aloft his cap and a rifle with a bouquet of flowers, is a portrait of Everit. The lower half shows men, women and children saying their farewells. The man at far right with the bouquet of flowers is a self-portrait of Herter, and the woman in white at the far left is a portrait of Herter's wife Adele (n√©e McGinnis). The work was painted in 1925-26 at the Chateau de Versailles. Herter donated the mural to the people of France, and it was unveiled in the departure hall at the Gare de l'Est on 8 June 1926, in the presence of the former French Commander-in-Chief Marshal Joffre, the French Minister of War and former Prime Minister Paul Painlev√©, the Minister of Arts Anatole de Monzie, and the US Ambassador to France Myron T. Herrick. At the same ceremony, Herter was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur. The painting was removed from the Gare de l'Est in 1948, to be cleaned of the dirt deposited by years of smoke from steam trains. It returned in 1964, but was removed again in 2006 to allow the station to be adapted for the TGV Est. After restoration, it was reinstalled in early 2008 in the Hall d'Alsace.

Alice formed on from a tropical disturbance at both an atypically low latitude near the equator and during a time of year climatologically unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis. The system strengthened as it tracked northwest, reaching tropical storm strength on . Alice then began to move erratically through the Marshall Islands, causing heavy rainfall and gusty winds that destroyed crops throughout the archipelago. Significant damage occurred in Majuro and Enewetak Atoll, where gusts of were reported and one person was injured. Nuclear cleanup operations on Enewetak in the wake of postwar nuclear tests there were disrupted, with repair of cleanup facilities lasting several months. The damage toll was estimated at between US$50,000‚Äì$500,000. After January 6, Alice strengthened into a typhoon and took a westward course, strengthening to its peak intensity with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) two days later. A weakening trend began thereafter as the storm tracked south of Guam on January 10, prompting thousands to evacuate to shelters though ultimately causing minor damage. After passing the island Typhoon Alice reintensified to a secondary peak intensity before strong wind shear induced rapid weakening, resulting in the storm's dissipation on January 15. Meteorological history The origins of Alice were traced back to a tropical disturbance over the Gilbert Islands on , during a climatologically unfavorable time for tropical cyclone formation. The disturbance was segmented into two components directly north and south of the equator. Initially, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) believed that the disturbance's placement near the equator meant further storm development was unlikely. However, the system progressively organized and was classified as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) by 12:00 UTC on December 31. The JTWC followed suit in the upgrade twelve hours later, and soon after declared a tropical cyclone formation alert at 03:00 UTC on January 1, 1979. Tracking towards the northwest, atmospheric conditions became more favorable for intensification farther from the equator. The tropical depression became sufficiently organized to be named Tropical Storm Alice by the JTWC at 18:00 UTC that day. Over the next several days, Alice meandered through the Marshall Islands without much change in strength, steered by a transient shortwave trough. The trough's influence soon abated, allowing a nearby ridge of high pressure to restrengthen and induce a westerly bearing to Alice's motion that would continue for five days. Alice strengthened into a typhoon on January 6 and continued to intensify thereafter, reaching a peak intensity on January 8 with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg). Concurrently, the typhoon accelerated to a forward speed of and began to weaken. An area of wind shear southeast of Guam, described by the JTWC as a \\"frontal shear-line\\", slowed Alice's movement on January 9. A region of cooler and drier air north of this region was entrained also into the storm, causing Alice to lose some organization and weaken further. Two days later, a second trough over eastern Asia resulted in Alice curving north. During this trek, the typhoon restrengthened and reached a secondary peak intensity with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) on January 11, with satellite imagery indicating robust outflow. However, this second peak was short-lived as Alice's circulation began to vertically decouple in the face of strong wind shear, exacerbated by Alice's low-level circulation moving directly into the westerly wind flow aloft. The typhoon degenerated into a tropical storm on January 13 and weakened further into a tropical depression 18 hours later; these remnants dissipated by January 15. Preparations, impact, and aftermath Satellite image of Enewetak Atoll in 2014 In its earlier stages of development, Alice passed near several of the Marshall Islands. At the time, nuclear waste cleanup operations were ongoing at Enewetak Atoll following the United States' postwar nuclear tests there. On January 4, storm preparations were ordered for military assets on the atoll, beaching boats, evacuating cargo ships, and securing buildings. Most personnel stationed at Lojwa Camp were evacuated to Enewetak Camp. The center of the storm tracked within northeast of Kwajalein Atoll on the morning January 4 before passing within south of Enewetak two days later. Rough surf at Kwajalein damaged breakwaters and piers. Sustained winds there reached with gusts to . Significant shoreline damage occurred along the lagoon-facing shores of the Kwajalein Missile Range, compounded by Alice's nearly stationary movement. Gusts of were measured at Enewetak where \\"considerable\\" damage was observed; the tropical storm battered the atoll for over six hours. The damage was worst at Enewetak Camp and minor at Japtan and Lojwa Camps on the atoll. A water tower was blown down and sheet metal was torn from the roofs and walls of buildings. Some buildings collapsed due to the winds. Large rocks were washed onto the runway at Enewetak Auxiliary Airfield. Storm surge inundated the Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory grounds under of water and washed out roads. A few boats, including a Landing Craft Utility and LCM-8, sustained minor damage. The storm cut off all power, forcing nuclear waste cleanup crews on the atoll to use emergency generators. \\"Extensive\\" damage was reported in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, and crops were destroyed throughout the archipelago. One person suffered minor injuries at Enewetak, and the damage toll was estimated at between US$50,000‚Äì$500,000. Population density and species richness of the sea snail genus Conus decreased as a result of the typhoon. Alice's presence also disrupted U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue operations for a missing sailboat with two onboard, preventing search planes from departing out of Kwajalein Atoll. U.S. President Jimmy Carter declared the Marshall Islands a disaster area, with federal disaster assistance activated for eight atolls. Initial recovery efforts following Alice at Enewetak lasted three weeks and cost over $264,000, while longer-term repair and replacement of nuclear cleanup facilities lasted several months. With Typhoon Alice expected to track near Guam, the island's civil defense force was placed on alert. All schools were closed aside from 20 used as shelters, housing thousands of evacuees. The United States Navy evacuated a submarine tender and submarines from the island. The United States Air Force was evacuated 14 B-52 bombers and five tanker planes from Andersen Air Force Base to Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa. Alice ultimately moved within south of Guam on January 10, causing minor damage as strong winds and large waves affected the island.

Like a standard CRISPR-Cas9 system, dCas9 activation systems rely on similar components such as Cas9 variants for modulation or modification of genes, gRNAs to guide Cas9 to intended targets, and vectors for introduction into cells. However, while a standard CRISPR-Cas9 system relies on creating breaks in DNA through the endonuclease activity of Cas9 and then manipulating DNA Repair mechanisms for gene editing, dCas9 activation systems are modified and employ transcriptional activators to increase expression of genes of interest. Such systems are usable for many purposes including but not limited to, genetic screens and overexpression of proteins of interest. Components dCas9 Cas9 Endonuclease Dead, also known as dead Cas9 or dCas9, is a mutant form of Cas9 whose endonuclease activity is removed through point mutations in its endonuclease domains. Similar to its unmutated form, dCas9 is used in CRISPR systems along with gRNAs to target specific genes or nucleotides complementary to the gRNA with PAM sequences that allow Cas9 to bind. Cas9 ordinarily has 2 endonuclease domains called the RuvC and HNH domains. The point mutations D10A and H840A change 2 important residues for endonuclease activity that ultimately results in its deactivation. Although dCas9 lacks endonuclease activity, it is still capable of binding to its guide RNA and the DNA strand that is being targeted because such binding is managed by other domains. This alone is often enough to attenuate if not outright block transcription of the targeted gene if the gRNA positions dCas9 in a way that prevents transcriptional factors and RNA polymerase from accessing the DNA. However, this ability to bind DNA can also be exploited for activation since dCas9 has modifiable regions, typically the N and C terminus of the protein, that can be used to attach transcriptional activators. Guide RNA See: Guide RNA, CRISPR A small guide RNA (sgRNA), or gRNA is an RNA with around 20 nucleotides used to direct Cas9 or dCas9 to their targets. gRNAs contain two major regions of importance for CRISPR systems: the scaffold and spacer regions. The spacer region has nucleotides that are complementary to those found on the target genes, often in the promoter region. The scaffold region is responsible for formation of a complex with (d)Cas9. Together, they bind (d)Cas9 and direct it to the gene(s) of interest. Since the spacer region of a gRNA can be modified for any potential sequence, they give CRISPR systems much more flexibility as any genes and nucleotides with a sequence complementary to the spacer region can become possible targets. Complementary base pairing between the sgRNA and genomic DNA allows targeting of Cas9 or dCas9 Transcriptional activators See: Transcriptional Activator, Transcription Factor Transcriptional Activators are protein domains or whole proteins linked to dCas9 or sgRNAs that assist in the recruitment of important co-factors as well as RNA Polymerase for transcription of the gene(s) targeted by the system. In order for a protein to be made from the gene that encodes it, RNA polymerase must make RNA from the DNA template of the gene during a process called transcription. Transcriptional activators have a DNA binding domain and a domain for activation of transcription. The activation domain can recruit general transcription factors or RNA polymerase to the gene sequence. Activation domains can also function by facilitating transcription by stalled RNA polymerases, and in eukaryotes can act to move nucleosomes on the DNA or modify histones to increase gene expression.Ma, J. (August 2011). Transcriptional activators and activation mechanisms. Protein and Cell, 2(11), 879-888. These activators can be introduced into the system through attachment to dCas9 or to the sgRNA. Some researchers have noted that the extent of transcriptional upregulation can be modulated by using multiple sites for activator attachment in one experiment and by using different variations and combinations of activators at once in a given experiment or sample. Expression system An expression system is required for the introduction of the gRNAs and (d)Cas9 proteins into the cells of interest. Typically employed options include but are not limited to plasmids and viral vectors such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector or lentivirus vector. Specific activation systems VP64-p65-Rta The VP64-p65-Rta, or VPR, dCas9 activator was created by modifying an existing dCas9 activator, in which a Vp64 transcriptional activator is joined to the C terminus of dCas9. In the dCas9-VPR protein, the transcription factors p65 and Rta are added to the C terminus of dCas9-Vp64. Therefore, all three transcription factors are targeted to the same gene. The use of three transcription factors, as opposed to solely Vp64, results in increased expression of targeted genes. When different genes were targeted by dCas9, they all showed significantly greater expression with dCas9-VPR than with dCas9-VP64. It has also been demonstrated that dCas9-VPR can be used to increase expression of multiple genes within the same cell by putting multiple sgRNAs into the same cell. dCas9-VPR has been used to activate the neurogenin 2 (link) and neurogenic differentiation 1 (link) genes, resulting in differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into induced neurons. A study comparing dCas9 activators found that the VPR, SAM, and Suntag activators worked best with dCas9 to increase gene expression in a variety of fruit fly, mouse, and human cell types. The dCas9-VPR activator increases transcription at the gene that it targets. Synergistic activation mediator To overcome the limitation of the dCas9-VP64 gene activation system, the dCas9-SAM system was developed to incorporate multiple transcriptional factors. Utilizing MS2, p65, and HSF1 proteins, dCas9-SAM system recruits various transcriptional factors working synergistically to activate the gene of interest.The dCas-SAM system uses msgRNA that has attached aptamers for different transcriptional factors (MS2,p65 and HSF1) to bind. In order to assemble different transcriptional activators, the dCas9-SAM system uses a modified single guide RNA (sgRNA) that has binding sites for the MS2 protein. Hairpin aptamers are attached to the tetra loop and the stem loop 2 of the sgRNA to become binding sites for dimerized MS2 bacteriophage coat proteins. As the hairpins are exposed outside of the dCas9-sgRNA complex, other transcriptional factors can bind to the MS2 protein without disrupting the dCas9-sgRNA complex. Thus, the MS2 protein is engineered to include p65 and HSF1 proteins. The MS2-p65-HSF1 fusion protein interacts with the dCas9-VP64 to recruit more transcriptional factors onto the promoter of the target genes. Employing the dCas-SAM system, Zhang et al. (2015) successfully reactivated the latent HIV gene to over-express viral proteins from the HIV host cells. They were able to over-express viral proteins substantially to trigger apoptosis of HIV-1 latent cells due to the toxicity of viral proteins. In another dCas-SAM system experiment, Konermann et al. (2015) found genes in melanoma cells that give resistance to a BRAF inhibitor through activating candidate genes via dCas system. Thus, the dCas9-SAM system can further be employed to activate latent genes, develop gene therapies, and discover new genes. SunTag The SunTag activator system uses the dCas9 protein, which is modified to be linked with the SunTag. The SunTag is a repeating polypeptide array that can recruit multiple copies of antibodies. Through attaching transcriptional factors on the antibodies, the SunTag dCas9 activating complex amplifies its recruitment of transcriptional factors. In order to guide the dCas9 protein to its target gene, the dCas9 SunTag system uses sgRNA. Tanenbaum et al.(2014) are credited for creating the dCas9 SunTag system. For the antibodies, they employed GCN4 antibodies which was bound to transcriptional factor VP64. In order to transport the antibodies to the nuclei of the cells, they attached NLS tag. To confirm the nuclear localization of the antibodies, sfGFP was used for visualization purpose. Therefore, the GCN4-sfGFP-NLS-VP64 protein was developed to be interact with dCas SunTag system. The antibodies successfully bound to SunTag polypeptides and activated target CXCR4 gene in K562 cell lines. Comparing with the dCas9-VP64 activation complex, they were able to increase the CXCR4 gene expression 5-25 times greater in K562 cell lines. Not only was there a greater CXCR4 protein overexpression but also CXCR4 proteins were active to further travel on the transwell migration assay. Thus, the dCas9-SunTag system can be used to activate genes that are present latently such as virus genes. The use of the Suntag system allows multiple antibodies fused to VP64 to bind to dCas9-Suntag. That in turn recruits RNA polymerase and increases gene expression. Applications The dCas9 activation system allows a desired gene or multiple genes in the same cell to be expressed. It is possible to study genes involved in a certain process using a genome wide screen that involves activating expression of genes. Examining which sgRNAs yield a phenotype suggests which genes are involved in a specific pathway. The dCas9 activation system can be used to control exactly which cells are activated and at what time activation occurs. dCas9 constructs have been made that turn on a dCas9-activator fusion protein in the presence of light or chemicals. Cells can also be reprogrammed or differentiated from one cell type into another by increasing the expression of certain genes important for the formation or maintenance of a cell type. Greater control over gene expression One research group used a system in which dCas9 was fused to a particular domain, C1B1. When blue light is shined on the cell, the Cry2 domain binds to C1B1. The Cry2 domain is fused to a transcriptional activator, so blue light targets the activator to the spot where dCas9 is bound. The use of light allows a great deal of control over when the targeted gene is activated. Removing the light from the cell results in only dCas9 remaining at the target gene, so expression is not increased. In this way, the system is reversible. A similar system was developed using chemical control. In this system, dCas9 recruits an MS2 fusion protein that contains the domain FKBP. In the presence of the chemical RAP, an FRB domain fused to a chromatin modifying complex binds to FKBP. Whenever RAP is added to the cells, a specific chromatin modifier complex can be targeted to the gene. That allows scientists to examine how specific chromatin modifications affect the expression of a gene. The dCAs9-VPR system is used as an activator by targeting it to the promoter of a gene upstream of the coding region. A study used various sgRNAs to target different portions of the gene, finding that the dCas9-VPR activator can act as an activator or a repressor, depending on the location it binds. In a cell, sgRNAs targeting the promoter could allow dCas9-VPR to increase expression, while sgRNAs targeting the coding region of the gene result in dCas9-VPR decreasing expression. Genome wide activation The versatility of sgRNAs allows dCas9 activators to increase the expression of any gene within an organism's genome. That could be used to increase expression of a protein coding gene or a transcribed RNA. A paper demonstrated that genome wide activation could be used to determine which proteins are involved in mediated resistance to a specific drug. Another paper used genome wide activation of long, noncoding RNAs and observed that increasing the expression of certain long noncoding RNAs conferred resistance to the drug vemurafenib. In both cases, the cells that survive the drug could be studied to determine which sgRNAs they contain. That allows researchers to determine which gene was activated in each surviving cell, which suggests which genes are important for resistance to that drug. Use in organisms A dCas9 fusion with VP64, p65, and HSF1 (heat shock factor 1) allowed researchers to target genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and increase transcription to a similar level as when the gene itself is inserted into the plant's genome. For one of the two genes tested, the dCas9 activator changes the number and size of leaves and made the plants better able to handle drought. The authors conclude that the dCas9 activator can create phenotypes in plants that are similar to those observed when a transgene is inserted for overexpression. Researchers have used multiple guide RNAs to target dCas9 activation system to multiple genes in a specific mouse strain in which dCas9 can be turned on in specific cell lines using the Cre recombinase system. Scientists used the targeting and increased expression of several genes to examine the processes involved in regeneration and carcinomas of the liver.

She served as vice chair of the in 1910 and on the board of numerous nursing facilities. She is recognized as one of the pioneers of the profession in Sweden. Early life Crown Princess Lovisa Children's Hospital Agda Sofia Meyerson was born as a twin with on 1 February 1866 in Stockholm, Sweden to Betty (n√©e Hirsch) and Herman August Meyerson. Her parents were Swedish Jews and belonged to the Mosaic Assembly. Her mother had been educated and though she participated in the mikveh before marriage, she did not shave her head. Herman was a wholesaler, who later worked as the Assistant Director of the Scandinavian Bank. Her paternal grandfather, Lesser Meyerson (also Meijerson) was a manufacturer and leader in the Mosaic community. Her maternal grandparents, Simon and Th√®r√©se (n√©e Suber) Hirsch were of German and French heritage and also operated a factory. The twins were the only daughters in the family, with two older brothers and one younger brother. The children were born in their grandfather Meyerson's home and moved several times to various locations around the city. The girls attended the √Öhlin Girls' School until 1882. Meyerson then attended the lecture courses of Otto Salomon to learn handicrafts and practical knowledge, before entering nurse's training in 1896 at Sabbatsberg Hospital. Without graduating, she then studied child care at the Crown Princess Lovisa Children's Hospital (sv) and Samaritan Children's Hospital (sv). Career After completion of her training, in 1897, Mayerson joined the Swedish Red Cross and then from 1898 to 1907 she worked as an overseer at the Bernhardt Hospital. In 1906, her mother died and Meyerson used her inheritance to purchase a five-story stone house at #56 Brahegatan, which was used as a nursing facility with a three-room apartment, which she and Gerda shared. She directed the operations at this nursing facility until 1917. It is unclear whether she paid herself a salary, or whether she provided her services free of charge at Sister Agdas Nursing Home. In 1910 the was founded and Meyerson was elected as its first deputy chairman. Between 1911 and 1922, she coordinated classes for nurses training from throughout the Nordic countries and served as a lecturer, as well as the organizer of the communications and accommodations for the participants in the courses. The weekly courses typically had over 200 participants and were both continuing education classes and practical skills practices. Assisting in the presentations were Dr. Ada Nilsson, who taught about women's diseases and Meyerson's twin, Gerda, who discussed social aspects. In 1912, Meyerson made a six-week investigative trip through Denmark, eastern Germany, and Finland for the government to evaluate education and working conditions of women who were working in the healthcare industry. She worked as secretary of the team for this comparative study from 1912 to 1916. The analysis also included information on the conditions and licensing requirements in Austria, England, Norway, the United States and western Germany. Between 1916 and 1918, Meyerson also worked with a team of doctors, nurses and politicians to evaluate working conditions for district nurses. Because there were no requirements for nursing education, Meyerson pressed for standards to be established for nursing schools and urged that they come under the regulating authority of the Medical Board. During World War I she helped develop a network of nurses who cared for 120 German nurses recuperating from fatigue or illness, who had been housed with various Swedish families by the Swedish Nursing Association. Between 1917 and 1924, Meyerson was the director of the nursing facility operated by the Swedish Nursing Association. In 1920, based largely upon the proposals made by the committee reviewing nursing conditions, the Riksdag passed legislation to establish nursing inspectors and conduct surveys on standardization. In 1921, she made another trip traveling through Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. She published an article in Travel Impressions on the educational requirements and hospital facilities she encountered on her trip. Over the course of her career, Meyerson published approximately thirty articles in Sjuksk√∂tersketidningen (Nursing Magazine), primarily having to do with increasing the competency and professionalism for nurses throughout Sweden. She was also instrumental in pressing for provisions to care for retired nurses. Death and legacy Meyerson died on 27 December 1924 at her home in Stockholm. She left a legacy to the Israeli Sickness and Funeral Society. She is remembered as the first vice-chair of the Swedish Nursing Association when it was formed in 1910. She was the driving force in providing for the social needs of patients in nursing facilities and concerned with the fate of retired nurses, proposing the Comrade Fund, to support aging nurses. The fund currently provides assistance for medical, eye or dental care.

He was suffect consul for the nundinium of June to July AD 99 as the colleague of Publius Sulpicius Lucretius Barba.Alison E. Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 467 Afer is known primarily from inscriptions. Memmius Afer's origins are disputed. Edward Champlin believes he was \\"almost certainly African and perhaps from Thugga\\",Champlin, Fronto and Antonine Rome (Cambridge: Harvard, 1980), p. 146 n. 45 while John Grainger suggests that his origins were in Spain. Ronald Syme, noting Afer's tribe was \\"Galeria\\", states that it is attested for only one city in North Africa, Hadrumetum, while later members of the gentilicum Memmius \\"tend to come from Bulla Regia or Gigthis\\"; on the other hand, Syme states the cognomen Afer is well-attested in Spain, while he counted eighteen instances of the gentilicum Memmius in the Spanish provinces.Syme, \\"Spaniards at Tivoli\\", Ancient Society, 13/14 (1982/1983), p. 250 Afer was the father-in-law of Tiberius Catius Caesius Fronto, the son of the poet Silius Italicus.John Grainger, Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96‚Äì99 (London: Routledge, 2003), p. 121 Two inscriptions, one from Tibur, the other from North Africa, name his son, Lucius Memmius Tuscillus Senecio; the North African inscription describes Afer as pronepoti and Senecio as nepoti, indicating that the family continued for two more generations. His cursus honorum is known only from the Tibur inscription, which has preserved only two of the offices Memmius Afer held. The first on the list is the imperial province of Gallia Aquitania; Werner Eck dated his tenure as governor from 94 to 96.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 322-324 Next he was proconsular governor of Sicily, which Eck dated to the years 97/98.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 328f However, Paul Leunissen notes that the order of these two offices is not certain, so it is possible his governorship of Sicily may have preceded that of Aquitania.Leunissen, \\"Direct Promotions from Proconsul to Consul under the Principate\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 89 (1991), p. 221 The men selected to be consuls in the year 99 numbered more than usual, and can be considered to reflect the emperor Trajan's choices, and the factions in the Senate he looked to for support. Both the ordinary consuls, Quintus Sosius Senecio and Aulus Cornelius Palma Frontonianus, were military men, each going on to enjoy the exceptional honor of a second consulate. Of the possibly as many as ten suffect consuls for that year, five are known; of these, two are provincials, two Italians, all of them active in government; the fifth, Afer's colleague Lucretius Barba, is only a name.Grainger, Nerva, pp. 100f Afer fades from history after his consulship.

The women, 20-year-old and 21-year-old cousins, were attacked by an illegal immigrant from Tunisia using a knife. Patrolling soldiers shot him dead at the scene. The brother of the attacker was later arrested and faced preliminary charges of suspicion of involvement in the train station attack. French police were cautious as to whether it was a terrorist attack, but it was later classified as jihadist terrorism by Europol. Attack Surveillance video showed the perpetrator sitting on a bench for a few minutes outside the station, then rising and stabbing a woman several times then running away while screaming Allahu akbar, before returning to attack the second woman. A female passerby attempted to intervene. The perpetrator then attempted to attack two soldiers patrolling the station, but was shot dead with two bullets. Police described the weapon used as a knife approximately 20 cm long. The victims were cousins, a 20-year-old medical student at Aix-Marseille University and a 21-year-old studying nursing in Lyon; one was stabbed while the other had her throat cut. The Prosecutor of France, Fran√ßois Molins, later confirmed that the perpetrator twice shouted \\"Allahu akbar\\". French prosecutors opened a preliminary investigation for \\"murders in connection with a terrorist enterprise\\" and \\"attempted assassination of persons holding public authority\\", but investigators remained cautious about the nature of the incident. Central, rather than anti- terrorist, police handled the investigation. French interior minister G√©rard Collomb said: \\"It might be a terrorist act, but at this point we can‚Äôt say so with certainty\\". Perpetrator On 30 September, the day before the attack, the perpetrator had been arrested in Lyon on suspicion of shoplifting. He was held overnight; however, he was not on the terror watch list and police released him. The perpetrator was found to have used multiple identities, but his real identity was established using fingerprints which matched those taken in seven previous incidents registered by French police since 2005. Authorities in Lyon had considered deporting him, but hesitated due to the uncertainty of his identity. He was carrying a Tunisian passport when arrested in Lyon on the day before the attack, but not carrying any ID at the time of the attack. He was in France illegally. Tunisian authorities have identified him as Ahmed Hanachi; he had been arrested for various offences there and a dozen times in France, and had admitted to police that he was addicted to drugs. French authorities said there was no outward evidence that the attacker had been radicalised. The investigators announced that no ties were found between the perpetrator and any terror group, though it was later classified as jihadist terrorism by Europol. The ISIS-related Amaq News Agency claimed that the perpetrator was a \\"soldier\\" of the Islamic State. The perpetrator's friends and family dismissed the notion that he was radicalised, saying that he was a drug addict who had lost his way. Investigators found jihadist videos on the attacker's phone.. Other arrests On 8 October, Italian police arrested a younger brother of the attacker, identified as 25-year-old Anis Hanachi in the town of Ferrara, after an international arrest warrant had been issued by France. He was being held on suspicion of complicity in the attack and of membership in a terrorist group. He had reportedly fought in Syria, and had previously been expelled from Italy in 2014 after arriving in Sicily illegally on a smuggler boat. On 10 October, Swiss police detained two Tunisians in the town of Chiasso near the Swiss-Italian border, including another brother of the attacker who was \\"known to foreign police services for his links to jihadist terrorist movements\\". The couple, a man and a woman who were seeking asylum in Switzerland were due to be sent back to Tunisia. The man's role in the Marseille attack, \\"if any, is not clear\\", Swiss police said. Tunisian authorities said two other siblings of the attacker living in Bizerte had been held for questioning. Reactions Both French President Emmanuel Macron and local politician Samia Ghali praised the efficiency of the Op√©ration Sentinelle soldiers who stopped the attack, with Ghali telling local radio \\"If the military had not been there, we would have had a lot more deaths.\\"  References  21st century in Marseille 2017 murders in France Crime in Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur Islamic terrorism in France Islamic terrorist incidents in 2017 October 2017 crimes October 2017 events in France Op√©ration Sentinelle Stabbing attacks in 2017 Stabbing attacks in France Terrorist incidents involving knife attacks Terrorist incidents in France in 2017 ","title":"2017 Marseille stabbing"},{"id":"55410720","text":"Kƒ±rƒ±kkale YHT railway station, short for Kƒ±rƒ±kkale Y√ºksek Hƒ±zlƒ± Tren railway station (), is a railway station located just north of Kƒ±rƒ±kkale, Turkey, that is under construction.

According to Jim Townsend, the game was launched in \\"roughly\\" 1976. Gameplay The Tribes of Crane was a turn-based game where players took on the role of leader of a tribe on the planet of Crane, and attempted to accumulate warriors, gold, and other resources. It was the first commercial play-by-mail game that was moderated by a human game master instead of a computer, although later the game master was assisted by a computer. A new player started by picking what type of tribe they wished to lead (herdsmen, warriors, merchants or sea people), and what type of climate and terrain they wanted to start in. The player would then be sent details of how many people and livestock were in the tribe. The player would mail a monthly turn, which consisted of a movement or stand-in-place order, a combat order, a transaction order, and any special orders. Special orders were unusual for play-by-mail games, which were often moderated by a computer. As reviewer Jeff Neufeld noted, \\"Properly utilized, this is the best part of the game... What can be done here is virtually unlimited. For instance, you can push development of a better crossbow, or breed faster horses. The big advantage of having a [human] gamesmaster is that he can decide on the feasibility of new ideas.\\" Knowledge of the world and other tribes was gained through moving from place to place, meeting other tribes and trading knowledge, or asking questions of the game master. There were up to 1200 players in each game, using a large map with 4600 sectors, 100 cities, and over a thousand non-player characters. When The Tribes of Crane began, the cost was $1 to join a game, and $1.50 for each monthly turn, with unlimited special orders. After several years, the number of turns increased to two per month, and the cost rose to $2.50 per turn. A charge of $1 per turn for special orders was also initiated, increasing the possible monthly cost for two turns to $7. Publication history Shannon Appelcline noted that games like Tribes of Crane were competitive with the PBM games from Flying Buffalo for a period of time, but that Flying Buffalo outlasted its competitors. Reception In the June 1979 edition of Dragon (Issue 26), Jeff Neufeld lauded the human gamemaster, the addition of special orders, and the gamemasters' habit of sending a self-addressed stamped envelope when replying to a player's turn. His one disappointment was the lack of interaction with other players, but overall, he believed that \\"Tribes of Crane is an excellent game and worth every penny it costs to play. However, in the July 1980 issue of The Space Gamer (Issue 29), Forrest Johnson disagreed that a human gamemaster was necessarily a good thing, noting, \\"[It] is the largest open-ended correspondence game around. But how open is it when an inexperienced GM appraises your turn, so that a sophisticated special action comes back marked simple 'noted,' or ignored altogether? How open is it when a different GM handles every turn, so the elaborate preparations of a previous turn are forgotten? The more involved a player is in Crane, the more frustrated he becomes.\\" In the April 1983 edition of Dragon (Issue 72), Michael Gray stated \\"This is a long-running, well-established game. If you are very creative, you can enjoy it for a long time.\\" In the July 1983 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #43), Trevor Graver liked the enjoyment that came from \\"discovering things. The amount of information one can acquire about Crane is staggering, information on anything from city life, through to details on an obscure religion all come together to paint a brilliant fantasy.\\" However, Graver did warn about the high cost of play: \\"Many prospective [Play-by- Mailers] flinch when they compare the cost of playing the game for a year, with say, the cost of the AD&D; works.\\" However, Graver concluded that \\"Tribes of Crane is well worth playing, and could very easily become an obsession.\\" In The Space Gamer 1979 Game Survey, readers rated Tribes of Crane 6.4 out of 9.

He rose to the rank of Lieutenant General. Like many other Irish officers in the decades following the Flight of the Earls in 1607, O'Farrell served in the Spanish Army. He was commissioned into an Irish Regiment and developed battle experience while serving under the veteran Owen Roe O'Neill. In 1641 a major rebellion broke out in Ireland, led by northern Catholics such as Sir Phelim O'Neill and Lord Maguire. While continuing to pledge allegiance to Charles I, they launched attacks on Protestant inhabitants. While much of Ulster and Connaught was seized, an attempt to capture Dublin failed. O'Farrell was one of many exiled officers who returned to join the army of the rebels, who established their own government in Kilkenny. He arrived at Wexford in the company of Rosa O'Neill and Henry Roe O'Neill, the wife and daughter of his former commander Owen Roe O'Neill.Casway p.75 Although appointed Colonel of a Longford regiment, O'Farrell's men were soon attached to the Ulster Army of O'Neill.Casway p.85 In 1646 he commanded his regiment during O'Neill's victory at the Battle of Benburb.Casway p.131-33 During the Siege of Dublin, O'Farrell was routed by troops led by Lord Inchiquin while attempting to bring a relief convoy to the beleaguered garrison of Dundalk. General Farrell was called upon to defend the besieged city of Waterford Siege of Waterford. Having isolated Waterford from the east and north, Cromwell arrived before the city on 24 November 1649. However, Waterford still had access to reinforcements from the west and up to 3000 Irish soldiers (from the Confederate's Ulster Army) under General Richard Farrell were fed into the city in the course of a week. Farrell, having been a successful officer in the Spanish army, was highly trained and experienced in siege warfare from battles in Flanders. Cromwell had came up against a superior minded soldier and commander, and could not himself take the city. Eventually Cromwell had to call off the first siege on 2 December and go into winter quarters at Dungarvan. When Owen Roe died in 1649, O'Farrell was one of the candidates to replace him as commander of the Ulster Army, although he did not receive the post.Casway p.264-65 He fought at the Battle of Scarrifholis the following year, which ended in the destruction of the army.Casway p.266 While many other officers were captured of killed, O'Farrell managed to escape and took shelter in Charlemont with Sir Phelim O'Neill.Casway p.266-267 He surrendered to the English Republican forces in 1652.

Life Early Pastoral Life Basil was born on May 16, 1915 in Jdita- Chtaura, in the Beqaa Governorate of Lebanon to his father, Economos Girgeos Kazan and mother, Tamam (Shehadey) Kazan. In 1935, Basil received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the Patriarchal School in Damascus, Syria. From 1939 to 1943, Kazan was a Professor at the Melkite Catholic seminary of Mar Yohanna in Khenchara, Lebanon. Then he was a professor at the Melkite Basilian Oriental College, in Zahle, Lebanon from 1943-1945. In the mid 1940s, Kazan moved to Beirut and served as a professor at the American University of Beirut from 1945-1947. After the end of the war, Basil served as the Secretary to Patriarch Alexander III of Antioch from 1947 to 1950. From there, Kazan moved to Athens, where he served as a Priest (and later became an Archimandrite), and a theological student at the University of Athens from 1950-1956. He graduated from the University of Athens in 1956, receiving a Diploma in Theology. First Journey to America, 1957-1967 In 1957, Basil Kazan moved to the United States of America. This was during the episcopacy of Metropolitan Anthony Bashir, who served as Archbishop of the North American archdiocese for the Church of Antioch from 1936 until his death in 1966. In America, he served as pastor of several parishes, including St. Michael Orthodox Church of Louisville, KY and St. George Orthodox Church in Cleveland, OH. He lived in the United States, serving various parishes from 1957 until 1964, when he returned to Lebanon. Moving back to Beirut, Kazan operated a bookstore there from 1964 to 1967. Second Journey to America While living in Beirut, in 1967, Kazan received a request to return to America from the newly appointed Metropolitan Philip Saliba, who succeeded Metropolitan Anthony as the Archbishop of the North American archdiocese. Metropolitan Philip's request, was for Basil Kazan to undertake a project of composing music for the entire year, and for all services. The composition was to be in English, and to follow the tradition Byzantine Chant, but to be composed in the English language, and in Western musical staff notation. This task would be the defining work of Basil's career, and would last for another 28 years until his retirement in 1995. In order to be close to the Archdiocesan center in Englewood, NY for his work in composing, Basil Kazan moved to New York, and served as head chanter at St. Mary's Antiochian Church in Brooklyn, NY. In 1970, Kazan resigned from the Priesthood, and married Viola Habeeb. The couple stayed in Brooklyn, and Kazan continued to serve as head chanter of St. Mary's Church until his death in 2001. Also in 1970, Kazan began to serve as a translator at the Berlitz School and Translation Service, where he worked for 10 years until 1980. He also served, from 1973 to 1980, as an advisor to the Consulate General of Lebanon in New York City. In 1974, the very first edition of the Byzantine Project was published. The first edition was entitled Phase I, Saturday Great Vesper Service, and was completed in February of that year. The volume included the hymns, in all Eight Byzantine Tones, for the Saturday Great Vespers service. This volume represents the first major publication of this type that had been made, up to that point, in English, and in the United States. Also in 1974, Bishop A. Shadrawi, the patriarchal Vicar General of Mexico and Central America asked Kazan to begin to compose music for the Divine Liturgy in Spanish. He also began to serve as the Assistant Examiner of the Board of Education in Brooklyn, which he did until 1984. In 1976, the second phase of the Byzantine Project was published. This added the service of Sunday Matins to the Saturday Great Vespers volume. Later Years Throughout the 1980s & early 1990s, Basil Kazan's work continued. His major works included settings for the feasts in the Menaion, Pentecostarion and Holy Week. It also included more smaller projects such as settings for Weddings, Funerals, Memorials, Akathists, Paraklesis, Presanctified Liturgy and the Holy Unction Service. Interestingly, Basil Kazan's work never included a full series of settings for the Divine Liturgy, possibly due to the prevalence of western-style choirs in Antiochian parishes. In 1992, he received the Antonian Gold Medal of Merit from Metropolitan Philip Saliba, marking his 25th year of work on the Byzantine Music Project. Basil Kazan's work on the \\"Byzantine Project\\" continued up until 1995, when his work was finally concluded with his retirement. By 1995, Kazan's work included 12-volumes of publications including the Menaion, Pentecostarion, Holy Week, Matins & Vespers. In 2001, the Antiochian Archdiocese decided to digitize Basil Kazan's work, which up to that point, had been either copies of handwritten scores, or typewritten scores, the effort to digitize his publications continued up into the late-2010s. Basil Kazan died on November 11, 2001 preceding his wife Viola, who died 11 years later on July 1st, 2012; they were buried together in Oceanview Cemetery on Staten Island in New York. 1915 births 2001 deaths Greek Orthodox Christians from Lebanon Lebanese composers Lebanese emigrants to the United States American University of Beirut faculty People from Zahle District ","title":"Basil Kazan"},{"id":"55411449","text":"Second Lake may refer to: *Second Lake (New York), part of the Fulton Chain of Lakes *Second Lake (Bisby Lakes, New York) *Second Lake, Nova Scotia ","title":"Second Lake"},{"id":"55411450","text":"Butchers Creek is a locality in the Tablelands Region, Queensland, Australia.

The album represented a significant change in direction for the band, as it was the first not produced by Wayne Bickerton and Tony Waddington - instead the Rubettes took on production responsibilities themselves, with Alan Blakley (formerly of the Tremeloes) as co-producer. The band made the decision due to the disappointing sales of their previous two Bickerton/Waddington singles and the desire to forge new musical directions.Liner notes from CD box set Rubettes - The Albums 1974-77 The Rubettes were a four-piece band by the time Sign Of The Times was recorded, as keyboardist Bill Hurd departed earlier in 1976.

The book is a culmination of his fifty years of work, and ibn Ashur poured in all of his innovative and reformist approaches toward hermeneutical engagement.

She holds several firsts in post-independence Kenyan politics, as the first female to climb up the ranks of the political system, defying cultural barriers. She was the first Kenyan female mayor, after she replaced Mathias Ondiek as the Kisumu Mayor in 1965. She was also the first female Member of Parliament in post- independence Kenya after she was elected to represent Kisumu Town Constituency in 1969. In Parliament, Grace Onyango was the first woman to sit on the speaker's chair as temporary deputy speaker, and served as Deputy Speaker from 1979 to 1984. Her political career ended after she lost her parliamentary seat in 1984. Onyango also served as the first female secretary-general of the Luo Union.  Early life and education  Born in Sakwa, in Nyanza Province, as the second of nine children, Grace Onyango went to Ng'iya Girls School. She then joined Vihiga Teachers Training College from where she graduated in 1955. She was posted back to her high school, Ng'iya Girls, as a teacher. Three years later, she was recalled to Vihiga Teachers Training College to work as a trainer. She married a teacher and journalist, Onyango Baridi, who died in 1969, leaving her with six children. She has 17 grandchildren and 11 great- grandchildren.  Political career  Grace Onyango elected councillor of Kaloleni Ward in Kisumu. After the death of Kisumu Mayor Mathias Ondiek in 1965, she joined the race to replace him. There were originally two other women in the race but they both dropped out \\"because of the hostile environment and abuses from male competitors.\\" That left Grace as the only female candidate in a field with six opponents, all male. She was elected mayor of the city of Kisumu in 1965. As Mayor, Grace Onyango fought for women's place in leadership and politics. She launched a policy where, if a serving male employee of the council died, his wife or a female relative would be employed to replace him. She advocated for this policy even at the top level, attending official functions with Phililia Olang, her predecessor's wife. She also Africanised Kisumu Town streets, naming them for key political leaders such as Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Paul Mbuya, and Milton Obote. In 1969, she ran for the Kisumu Town constituency parliamentary seat. All her opponents were male, and had significantly more financial resources than her. Her supporters coined the campaign slogan \\"Kura kwa Mama, Chakula kwa Khan\\" [Votes to Mama, Feeding at Khan's] meaning they would vote for her despite taking Remhat Khan's, her main challenger, money. She defeated Khan in the elections, marking the first time in post-independence politics that a woman had won a parliamentary seat. Asked by a journalist if she would not be 'lost' being the only woman in Parliament, she retorted \\"\\"I have always worked fearlessly along with men. And how do you expect me to feel afraid working with them this time?‚Äù  Parliamentary career  Of her career as a parliamentarian, Grace Onyango told The Standard in July 2018 that she \\"...was the minority in Parliament, standing up against 158 male MPs. But I dominated the debates\\". In one instance in November 1970, she asked Minister of State Mbiyu Koinange why the state had arrested a witchdoctor known as \\"Kajiwe\\" for oathing people at the Coast, but had not arrested those who organised oathing in Central Province the year before. In 1975, Grace Onyango was a member of the committee tasked with investigating the assassination of Josiah Mwangi Kariuki. When the committee chair, Elijah Mwangale tabled the report, she pointed out that it had been doctored at State House, by Jomo Kenyatta himself prior to publication. She and another Member of Parliament, Martin Shikuku, had hidden a copy of the original report in Room 7 in Parliament. The original report contained the names of Mbiyu Koinange and Wanyoike Thungu, Jomo Kenyatta's aide and enforcer. She also successfully lobbied for the abolishment of bicycle taxes. In her decade and a half in Parliament, a few other women were elected to the House. They included Dr. Phoebe Asiyo and Chelagat Mutai. She lost her parliamentary seat in 1983 to Robert Ouko, who would be assassinated less than a decade later.

It aired in the United States on Fox on October 1, 2017. The episode places the citizens of Springfield in a medieval fantasy kingdom called Springfieldia. This was the first Simpsons episode to be scored by composing team Bleeding Fingers Music since longtime composer Alf Clausen, who had scored the show since 1990, was dismissed from that position in August 2017. To date, this episode marks the final time that Apu is voiced by series cast member Hank Azaria. Plot In the kingdom of Springfieldia, the Serfsons visit Jacqueline Bouvier at The Webs at Giant Spider Acres, a retirement forest, of which Marge discovers, to her shock, that Jacqueline is freezing over. At Barber Hibbert's Surgery, Jacqueline is found with progressive frozen mortification after having being bitten by an ice walker, which converts the victim's flesh to ice in the span of a week. To save her, he proposes a treatment, buying an Amulet of Warmfyre. However the cost for it is too high, and Marge sends Homer to grab the necessary money. Azzlan appears trying to get the Serfsons to convert to Christianity only to be driven away by Marge. At the Springfieldia Human Power Plant, Homer attempts, unsuccessfully, to ask Lord Montgomery for the money. Seeing her father's plight, Lisa solves the problem by magically converting lead into gold. However, Lisa cannot perform magic in public as then she would be taken by King Quimby and get forced to become one of his evil wizards. At home, Marge gives the amulet to Jacqueline, who refuses at first, recognizing the futility of life, though she decides to wear it. At that moment, King Quimby's wizards appear and take Lisa away, charging her with witchcraft. To rescue her, Homer rallies the town's peasants into revolt. Upon scaling the castle, the peasants defeat King Quimby's wizards only to face a dragon. Jacqueline decides to remove the amulet, turning her into an ice-compository human and sacrifice herself to defeat the dragon of which she succeeds. However, it is revealed that the dragon was the source of all magic in the kingdom including all magical creatures. Lisa suggests that the kingdom can now base their lives on science, to everyone's dismay. Homer decides to light coals in an attempt to revive the dragon. This succeeds only for the dragon to burn the village down. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- stating, \\"‚ÄôThe Serfsons‚Äô is, for what it is, a serviceable goof of an episode whose biggest flaw is its utter disposability, especially as a way to kick off the new season. The show has done a gimmick episode as a season premiere more than once, and they‚Äôre perhaps intended to snag viewers with a few unambitious pop culture references. Fair enough. ‚ÄòThe Serfsons,‚Äô on its own, has a healthy handful of such things, as‚Äîdispensing with any framing device or rationale for the fanciful outing‚ÄîThe Simpson family is the downtrodden peasant Serfson family in sort of a 'Game of Thrones', 'Lord of the Rings', 'Dungeons & Dragons' mashup extravaganza.\\" \\"The Serfsons\\" scored a 1.4 rating with a 5 score and was watched by 3.26 million people, making it Fox's second highest rated show of the night.

Opened on December 15, 2006, it is located inside Palazzo Santa Margherita, in Modena, Italy.  History  The Collectible cards museum was born for the collector's will and passion by Giuseppe Panini, the founder of the Panini Group and the creator of the renewal of the collectible cards in the modern sense, who wanted to support his product through a small print story gathering, since the beginning of his business, hundreds of thousands of small prints from all over the world, similar to the figurine for technique or function. The collection expanded to such an extent as to become, in 1986, a museum located within the company itself. In 1992 Giuseppe Panini decided, in agreement with the company and the Municipality of Modena, to donate the collection, which has become one of the most important in the world in its city, the world's capital of the collectible cards, a museum that could document its origins and development to the most modern production techniques. Over the years to follow, the museum's activities focused on the cataloging of the collection, consisting of about 500,000 cards, on its expansion and its dissemination through publications and thematic exhibitions.  The rooms  The layout includes a permanent section divided into the following main areas: * The antecedents: recurring iconographic themes; * Chromolithography: the advent of chromolithographic printing and the path from the sketch to the card; * The birth and spread: from the dawn of the card in the second half of the nineteenth century in France until the prizes in Italy in the thirties of the twentieth century; * Liebig: the world's most famous collection of cards; * Not just collectible cards: barber calendar, cigarette cards, placemarks, menus, sealing stamps, hotel labels and other smaller collections; * The modern collectible cards: the cards dedicated to the world of sport, especially to football, and the spread of albums in the post-war period. The museum is set up in a large exhibition hall, where there are six cabinets, corresponding to six large albums to browse. In them, the whole story of cards has been traced back to the most innovative production techniques. Each wardrobe corresponds to a precise path, marked by original prints and objects, for a total of 2,500 pieces, which are part of the museum's heritage (about 500,000 cards in total). In addition to the real cards that represent the main part of the collection, Giuseppe Panini wanted to represent the whole world of small color prints: English cigarettes cards, cigar cords, boxes matches, menus and hotel labels, candy papers, barber calendar, and 80,000 stamp stamps. For the exhibition purpose, the Museum usually organizes temporary exhibitions, which propose a specific theme. There is also a workshop for didactic activities and a specialized library in the Museum.

Biography  Duncan received his Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude from Louisiana State University and his Juris Doctor from the Paul M. Hebert Law Center at Louisiana State University, where he was inducted into the Order of the Coif and served as executive senior editor of the Louisiana Law Review. Duncan subsequently earned a Master of Laws from Columbia Law School. After graduating from law school, Duncan clerked for Louisiana-based Circuit Judge John M. Duh√© Jr. of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. From 2008‚Äì2012, Duncan served as Appellate Chief for Louisiana's Attorney General's office. Some media have incorrectly stated that Duncan served as Solicitor General of Louisiana during his time at the Attorney General's office, but the title of Solicitor General did not yet exist during the time that Duncan worked there. From 2012‚Äì2014, Duncan served as general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, where he managed Becket's nationwide public-interest litigation. He has been a member of the Federalist Society since 2012. Duncan spent four years as an assistant professor of law at the University of Mississippi Law School. He also spent two years as an associate-in-law at Columbia University Law School, three years as an Assistant Solicitor General in the Office of the Solicitor General in the Texas Attorney General's Office, and one year in the appellate practice group at Vinson & Elkins LLP. Duncan has argued two cases before the Supreme Court of the United States, and has acted as lead counsel in numerous other cases in that Court, including Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S.Ct. 2751 (2014), in which he successfully led litigation challenging the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate on behalf of Hobby Lobby stores.President Donald J. Trump Announces Eighth Wave of Judicial Candidates\\" White House, September 28, 2017 Before becoming a judge, Duncan practiced at the Washington, D.C., firm of Schaerr Duncan LLP, where he was a partner alongside Gene Schaerr and Stephen S. Schwartz.  Federal judicial service  On September 28, 2017, President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate Duncan to an undetermined seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On October 2, 2017, he was officially nominated to the seat vacated by Judge W. Eugene Davis, who took senior status on December 31, 2016. On November 29, 2017, a hearing was held on his nomination before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On January 3, 2018, his nomination was returned to the President under Rule XXXI, Paragraph 6 of the United States Senate. On January 5, 2018, President Donald Trump announced his intent to renominate Duncan to a federal judgeship. On January 8, 2018, his renomination was sent to the Senate. On January 18, 2018, his nomination was reported out of committee by a party-line 11‚Äì10 vote. Duncan's nomination was generally opposed by Democrats and supported by Republicans. On April 23, 2018, the Senate voted to invoke cloture on Duncan's nomination by a vote of 50‚Äì44. On April 24, 2018, his nomination was confirmed by a vote of 50‚Äì47. He received his judicial commission on May 1, 2018.  Notable cases  Duncan wrote for the court in In Re: Larry Swearingen, No. 19-20565, denying the fourth habeas corpus petition and a delay of execution for Larry Swearingen, who was convicted of the 1998 murder of Melissa Trotter. While Swearingen maintained his innocence, Duncan stated that the latest petition did not meet the requirements for a federal habeas corpus petition. The latest appeal was made based upon two letters from Brady Mills, director of the Texas crime lab. Mills' first letter noted that the criminologist used the terms \\"unique\\" and \\"to the exclusion of others\\" to describe the piece of pantyhose found in Swearingen's home matching the piece of pantyhose used to murder Trotter. Mills noted this was \\"common language throughout the forensic community, at the time\\" but would not be used today. Mills' second letter addressed the testimony regarding blood found under Trotter's fingernails that did not match Swearingen's as being a product of contamination. The letter stated that the blood could have been from contamination but also could have been evidence. The court noted that these \\"'new' claims in this latest phase could not possibly have made any difference to the outcome of his trial\\" and have \\"not come close to establishing that 'no reasonable fact-finder' would have found him guilty.\\" Following a failed petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, Swearingen was executed by the State of Texas on August 22, 2019. In United States v. Norman Varner, Duncan denied a pro se motion to change the name on the judgment from Norman Varner to Kathrine Nicole Jett.United States v. Norman Varner The opinion attracted attention for also rejecting a request to refer to Varner with feminine pronouns, and going at length into perceived problems with granting such a request. Judge James L. Dennis, a Clinton appointee, dissented and wrote that Duncan misconstrued the motion. In Dennis's view, it was merely a polite request that this specific proceeding use Varner's pronouns, usually granted as a courtesy; not an overarching demand requiring six pages of obiter dictum about the threat of courts being forced to use custom pronouns everywhere. Dennis also wrote that there was no need to rule on the matter at all. The ruling attracted attention from LGBT advocates, who saw it as confirmation of their warnings about Duncan prior to his confirmation as a judge. Duncan penned the court's opinion in Hill v. Washburne regarding Albert Hill III's challenge to the validity of his late father Albert Hill Jr.'s will. Hill III is the great-grandson of late Texas oil tycoon H.L. Hunt and had previously agreed to a nine-figure settlement in exchange for not contesting the will of his father, Hill Jr. This is one of many challenges resulting from the estate of H.L. Hunt, who died in 1974, and the fifth challenge to the Hill Jr./Hill III settlement agreement. Hill III's sisters asked the court to enforce the settlement agreement and permanently enjoin any challenges to their father's will, the district court agreed. Hill III challenged the district court's injunction but Duncan and the Fifth Circuit affirmed the injunction and remanded the case to the district court to determine if Hill III's sisters are entitled to additional costs and fees. Duncan penned the Fifth Circuit's April 2020 opinion granting mandamus to uphold an order by Texas Governor Greg Abbott that temporarily banned abortions during the coronavirus pandemic.

She is a member of the Brain Research Institute (BRI) at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and is the director of its Multiple Sclerosis Program. Voskuhl has published numerous scientific articles in academic journals and has served in the role of principal investigator for several treatment trials investigating potential treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS).  Research   Approach and Research Model  Voskuhl has described her research as \\"bedside to bench to bedside\\", meaning observations made in clinical settings are used as a basis for the investigation of the relevant biological mechanisms of action. The information discovered is then applied in a clinical setting, typically through a drug therapy.  MS and Female Sex Hormones  Due to well-documented differences in prevalence of MS in males and females, significant research on the autoimmune condition has turned to the neuropreservative effects of sex hormones. Evidence of suppression of MS symptoms in pregnant women in the third trimester ultimately led to a focus on the female sex hormone estriol. = The Mouse Model: Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) = In 2001, Voskuhl published an article outlining discrepancies in EAE between male and female mice; she noted that females were more susceptible to EAE, mirroring the sex- based difference in MS in humans. It was found that the neuroprotective effects of testosterone contributed most to this discrepancy in mice. However, this sex difference is reduced during late pregnancy in females, when estriol levels are significantly higher than other periods of life. Her article established high levels of estriol as a possible explanation for the reduction in EAE symptoms observed during late pregnancy. = Estriol Treatment for Women with MS = In 2002, Voskuhl was part of the investigative team that found that treating non-pregnant women with 8 mg/day estriol helped to relieve symptoms, including lesion number and volume. Upon cessation of treatment, lesion number and volume returned to pre-treatment levels. After reinstituting treatment, lesion number and volume again decreased significantly. Cognitive ability, evaluated by the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), also improved in those treated with estriol. In the authors' abstract, they indicated that this result warranted further experimentation through a placebo-controlled clinical trial. This experiment was small, with only six women with relapse remitting MS (RRMS) and four women with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) finishing the trial. The authors noted that estriol generally improved symptoms in women with RRMS, but not in those with SPMS. = Molecular Basis for Estrogen's Neuroprotective Activity = In a 2011 research article, Voskuhl published data revealing that the estrogen receptor Œ± (ERŒ±) on astrocytes, not neurons, was responsible for the reduction of clinical EAE symptoms in mice. Using a gene knockout system Cre-Lox, the research team was able to remove ERŒ± from neurons and in separate mice, remove ERŒ± from astrocytes. It was found that the mice with ERŒ± knocked out in astrocytes experienced an increase in clinical disease symptoms, macrophage and T-cell inflammation in the central nervous system, and axonal loss. These symptoms were not observed in those mice who had ERŒ± removed from neurons. = Phase II Trial of Estriol as a Treatment for Women with RRMS = In 2016, the results of a Phase II Trial, in which Voskuhl participated, were released, detailing an experiment in which women with RRMS were treated daily with 8 mg estriol or placebo, combined with 20 mg injectable glatiramer acetate - an immunomodulator currently used to treat MS. It was found that women with the estriol treatment had significantly less relapses than the placebo group (0.25 relapses/year and 0.37 relapses/year, respectively), with similar amounts of serious adverse health events. The success of this trial convinced the authors to report that a Phase III Trial was warranted.  MS and Male Sex Hormones  In 2008, Voskuhl, together with Dr. Stefan Gold et al., published a study that revealed the effects of treating men with MS with a 10g gel containing 100 mg testosterone. Based upon the shift in cellular and chemical composition, particularly a decrease in IL-2 cell production, an increase in production growth factor TGFŒ≤1, a decrease in CD4+ T cells, and an increase in NK (natural killer) cells, it was found that testosterone may play an important role in immunomodulation and neuroprotection. In a 2009 review article discussing the effects of sex hormones on MS, Voskuhl and Gold noted that one small trial conducted by a research team headed by Dr. Nancy Sicotte suggested testosterone could be effective in preserving cognitive performance and reducing brain atrophy. However, this trial yielded no significant effect on the formation of brain lesions.  In Media   NPR Morning Edition  In 2014, Voskuhl participated in an interview discussing estriol as a potential treatment for women with MS. The article discussed how estriol was identified as a potential candidate for drug treatment, including an anecdote about Melissa Glasser, a woman who experienced a reduction in her MS symptoms during each of her four pregnancies.  NPR Berlin  In 2016, Voskuhl was quoted in an article addressing gender bias in scientific study; she noted that male and female mice had different disease progression in the animal MS model.

The case, brought by the Texas Democratic Party as lead plaintiff, was later resolved on the merits by a different panel of the Fifth Circuit, but solely on the Twenty-sixth Amendment age discrimination claim, which the court rejected. With the agreement of the plaintiff-appellees, the other claims were remanded to the district court, with some guidance regarding the treatment of the equal protection claim that the plaintiffs had asserted independently of their 26th Amendment claim. On June 16, 2020, the Plaintiffs- Appellees filed a petition for certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, urging solely their 26th Amendment claim, which remains pending. Having declined to overturn the Fifth Circuit's stay order on an emergency basis prior to that court's decision on the merits. On October 12, 2020, Ho wrote a concurring opinion on another motions panel faced with a voting rights controversy on an emergency basis.

In 1978, he retired as Professor Emeritus, after 31 years in the Department of Theoretical & Applied Mechanics (TAM) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His interests were centered on dimensional analysis, spanning fluid to solid mechanics, and specific research areas included aircraft structures, plates and shells, and buckling theory.  Early life  Langhaar was born on October 14, 1909 in Bristol, Connecticut. He attended high school in Hackettstown, New Jersey. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering from Lehigh University in 1931 and 1933, respectively. From 1933‚Äì1936, Langhaar worked as a Test Engineer for the Ingersoll-Rand Corporation, and from 1936-1937 as a seismographer with the Carter Oil Company. While working with Carter Oil in Anthony, Kansas, he met his future wife, Isabelle Babcock, a school teacher, whom he married in 1937. He returned to Lehigh University later that year and in 1940 obtained his Ph.D. in mathematics. His thesis title was \\"Steady Flow in the Transition Length of a Cylindrical Conduit.\\"H. L. Langhaar, \\"Steady flow in the transition length of a cylindrical conduit,\\" Ph.D. dissertation, Lehigh Univ., Allentown, PA, 1940. Langhaar was an instructor in mathematics at Purdue University during 1940‚Äì1941, where he also took classes in mechanics offered by the eminent theoretical physicist and applied mathematician Cornelius Lanczos. Langhaar would remark later in life: \\"Lanczos‚Äô epistemology and the harsh realities of engineering problems did much to shape my attitudes towards mechanics.\\"H. L. Langhaar, \\"Highlights in the professional career of Henry L. Langhaar,\\" unpublished. Langhaar worked as a structural engineer from 1941-1947 at Consolidated-Vultee AirCraft Corporation (Convair) in San Diego, California. At Convair he worked on aircraft design problems involving plates and shells, buckling, diagonal tension beams, plate-stringer combinations, cut-outs in shells, and fuselages.  Career at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  In 1947, Langhaar took a position as an Associate Professor of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and advanced to Professor two years later. He developed many of the graduate-level TAM courses, including Dimensional Analysis, Theory of Shells, Theory of Buckling, and Energy Methods, and he directed 30 students toward doctoral degrees. Langhaar‚Äôs academic achievements earned him international recognition for numerous areas of solid mechanics and applied mathematics.W. H. Hager, Hydraulicians in the USA 1800-2000: a biographical dictionary of leaders in hydraulic engineering and fluid mechanics. Boca Raton: CRC Press, 2015. He authored two widely used graduate textbooks: Dimensional Analysis and the Theory of Models, and Energy Methods in Applied Mechanics. Dimensional Analysis and the Theory of Models, written in 1951, became a \\"classic text\\" in the field.\\"Distinguished Alumni Awards,\\" Engineering at Illinois. [Online]. Available: http://engineering.illinois.edu/engage/distinguished-alumni-and- friends/distinguished/article/5721. [Accessed: 04-Sep-2017]. He also coauthored an elementary text, Engineering Mechanics. Langhaar was the author or coauthor of more than 40 technical papers covering a broad spectrum of applied mechanics and mathematics, including hydrodynamics, structural analysis, aircraft structures, plate and shell theories, stability of mechanical systems, buckling theory, dimensional analysis, stress functions, numerical methods, applied elasticity theory, elastic stability theory, viscoelasticity, vibrations, complementary energy, strength of cooling towers, population theory, and engineering education.H.

She is a co-founder of the Theater Three Collaborative in New York City, and teaches theater at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. She is also the editor of a notable anthology, Women and Theater: Compassion and Hope (1984).  Biography  She was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, to a Jewish mother and an Italian-American father. Because of her dual background, Malpede has said, she never quite fit in with any one group, and that has had a freeing effect on her as a dramatist. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Wisconsin and a Master of Fine Arts degree in theater at the Columbia University School of the Arts. Malpede's first play, A Lament for Three Women, was published in A Century of Plays by American Women (Richards Rosen Press, 1979), and she has been writing and producing plays ever since. In 1995, she co-founded the Theater Three Collaborative with her husband, George Bartenieff, and the late Lee Nagrin, both actors. The purpose was to enable them \\"to produce plays that could not be produced elsewhere\\" because of their social justice themes. Her play Extreme Whether, for example, depicts the struggle of scientists to tell the truth about climate change in the face of opposition from the fossil fuel industry, while Another Life is about the U.S. government torture program. Malpede's one-man play, I Will Bear Witness, is adapted from the diaries of Victor Klemperer, a German Jew who documented the persecution of Jews in Dresden between 1933 and 1945. The production, which she directed, won Obie Awards for acting and set design. Malpede's short stories, reviews, and other writings have been published in New Theatre Quarterly, the Women's Review of Books, the Kenyon Review, and other periodicals; and in anthologies such as Helen Barolini's The Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian American Women (1985).

Originally founded in 1904, they competed in the Junior grade from 1923 until folding in 1962. History Origins and early years The club was initially formed as a team for former pupils of Queen Mary Street School in Bridgeton in the East End of Glasgow. The reason for choosing the title Waverley is uncertain, although there was a public house of that name situated very close to the school. They played at Juvenile level before disbanding during World War I; upon reforming they became a powerful force at that level, winning the Glasgow Juvenile Cup five times and the Scottish Juvenile Cup three times in succession between 1922 and 1924 (the only team ever to achieve this feat). Juniors: at Shawfield The success at Juvenile level convinced the Bridgeton Waverley committee to seek a place in the Junior leagues, having been permitted by senior club Clyde F.C. and their manager Frank Thompson to play fixtures at their Shawfield Stadium ground in Rutherglen as they sought a local home ground of their own. At that time the city of Glasgow was densely populated and heavily industrialised, and there were many clubs already established in the area. The most notable was the giants Celtic F.C., although their Irish-Catholic connections held little appeal for many of the area's residents. Junior clubs Strathclyde and Parkhead were based in the vicinity of Bridgeton, and other established clubs Glencairn, Shettleston, St Roch's, Shawfield, Baillieston, Vale of Clyde and Cambuslang Rangers were all within a few miles and could be expected to compete for players. However, despite these challenges, Waverley performed well from the outset, having joined the Second Glasgow District League for 1923‚Äì24 while also putting out a side at juvenile level. They reached the semi-finals of the most prestigious national competition, the Scottish Junior Cup, at the first attempt, eventually being eliminated by neighbours Parkhead; the match at Celtic Park attracted an attendance of 11,500, even though the senior Scottish Cup final was taking place at Hampden Park at the same time. For 1924‚Äì25 Bridgeton moved on to the more auspicious Scottish Junior League, winning its Victory Cup knockout tournament in 1925. Due to the similarities in name and location, Bridgeton Waverley may have had some connection to a team named Rutherglen Waverley who competed in the same league in 1924‚Äì25 but did not appear again, possibly having been absorbed by the Bridgeton side. Move to Barrowfield In 1925‚Äì26 Bridgeton reached the final of the Scottish Junior Cup for the first time, losing 2‚Äì0 to neighbours Strathclyde in a replay at Firhill Stadium, and also won the Glasgow North-Eastern Cup. They finished in fourth place in the league, and repeated this the following season before joining the Intermediate dispute in 1927. That year saw the club move to their new home ground, Barrowfield Park, on the boundary between Bridgeton and Camlachie (this is not to be confused with Barrowfield Park which was the home of Clyde in the 19th century, both names deriving from the historic Barrowfield estate which once occupied much of the surrounding area). During the four-year period, Waverley won the Intermediate League title in 1930‚Äì31, beating Yoker Athletic in the championship game, having lost to Clydebank Juniors in the corresponding fixture the previous year. Yoker gained some revenge by beating Waverley in the final of the 1931 Intermediate Cup (which would thereafter become the West of Scotland Cup). Bridgeton Waverley became a member of the new Central Junior League. They reached the final of the 1931‚Äì32 Glasgow Junior Cup, losing to Shawfield, and were runners-up in that competition again in 1933‚Äì34 when Petershill prevailed. The latter campaign also saw a second Scottish Junior Cup Final appearance, with the result on this occasion a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Benburb at Ibrox. New Barrowfield In 1936 the long wait for a victory in a final ended at last, with the club lifting the West Of Scotland Cup after a replay against Vale of Clyde. The club was also forced to move home in 1936 when the Glasgow Corporation exercised a compulsory purchase order on Barrowfield Park in order to construct a new housing scheme (also called Barrowfield) on the land. Waverley identified a new site at Westthorn on the boundary of Parkhead, Dalmarnock and Braidfauld adjacent to Belvidere Hospital. This ground was named New Barrowfield, meaning there were three different football venues known by that name, albeit the others no longer existed. The move brought the club into even closer proximity with Strathclyde (whose Springfield Park ground was on the other side of the hospital) and Parkhead (whose Helenslea Park was just yards away across London Road). Parkhead Stadium railway station was nearby. In 1939 a new rival emerged from within the club itself, as Dennistoun Waverley were formed as an breakaway (possibly due to the relocation - the original Barrowfield was far closer to the Dennistoun area); they set up home in the Haghill neighbourhood just over a mile from New Barrowfield and were admitted to the same league as Bridgeton just prior to World War II. Waverley's status as a club representing the Protestant community (or at least perceived to do so) meant there were sometimes incidents involving their supporters and fans of other teams with Catholic sympathies. In 1928 a large-scale disturbance occurred at a game against Blantyre Celtic, and in 1936 there was an unsavoury incident in the Glasgow Cup semi-final between Bridgeton and St Anthony's, with fighting amongst fans in the stands at Celtic Park; Waverley won 6‚Äì0 on the day, but had used an ineligible player, and the Ants won the resulting replay. Carntyne and demise Bridgeton's most successful times were now behind them, and though they maintained their league status for the next 20 years, they never challenged for major honours again. In 1960, New Barrowfield was subject to another housing CPO by the city fathers and Waverley were again forced to move, this time to Carntyne Stadium a mile to the north, which was more suited to greyhound racing and speedway. By this point, many of the local Junior clubs were in financial difficulty; distractions of modern living had made attending matches less appealing, and Glasgow's housing improvement programme was in full swing, with much of the population of the crowded, substandard tenements decanted to new overspill estates on the edge of town ‚Äì for East End residents this typically meant Easterhouse and Cranhill, although no new Junior teams were established in these vast schemes. Shawfield had folded in 1960, and Bridgeton Waverley followed in 1962. They would not be the last, with Parkhead ceasing operations in 1963, Strathclyde in 1965 and Dennistoun Waverley in 1968. Housing was never built on New Barrowfield as had been planned; it became the training ground for Celtic for the next 40 years and still contains football pitches. Housing now occupies the Carntyne site as well as the Dennistoun ground, the hospital and the Strathclyde ground (which formed part of the Athletes' Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games), while the Parkhead site is a public park and the Shawfield F.C. ground was bulldozed for the M74 motorway extension. The club was reformed on an amateur basis in 1976, going on to win tournaments in the 1990s; goalkeeper Derek Atkins played senior football for Clyde after developing at Waverley Amateurs. Notable players A number of players made the move from Waverley to senior football, with three becoming full Scottish internationals: Willie Mills, Tommy Law and Pat Quinn. The latter also represented the club in the Scotland Junior international team, along with others who did not reach the same level professionally: W. Crichton (1925), Olly McHarg (1927), Alexander Mathieson (1934), George Wilson (1936, whose 5 goals in one match and 7 overall are records) and Alf Maitland (1950).

It was launched on 1 November 2017 as one of two replacements of the outgoing Channel 2. History Israel's Channel 2 was operated by the Second Authority for Television and Radio, but was programmed by two rotating companies, Keshet Media Group and Reshet. As part of a larger series of reforms to Israel's broadcast system to increase diversity and competition, Channel 2 was shut down, and both broadcasters were granted their own, separate channels. Reshet 13 officially launched on 1 November 2017, alongside Keshet 12. The Israel Television News Company continued to provide news programmes for both channels; the main primetime bulletin is simulcast by both channels, while other programs are divided among the two channels. In June 2018, due to financial issues caused by the 2017 Channel 2 split, RGE (owner of Channel 10) filed a merger with this channel's parent company Reshet. In October 2018, Reshet announced that the merger had cancelled. Reshet's owners have since reconsidered the merger, and after a long battle with the Second Authority, the merger was approved, and was scheduled for January 16, 2019. The merger saw certain programmes previously shown on Channel 10 moved to Reshet 13, which subsequently changed its name to channel 13, with the new slogan \\"everything connects\\".

Between 10:05 and 10:15p.m. PDT, he fired more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition from his 32nd floor suites in the Mandalay Bay Hotel, killing 60 people and wounding 411, with the ensuing panic bringing the injury total to 867. About an hour later, Paddock was found dead in his room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His motive remains officially undetermined. The incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in modern United States history. It focused attention on firearms laws in the U.S., particularly with regard to bump stocks, which Paddock used to fire shots in rapid succession, at a rate of fire similar to automatic weapons. As a result, bump stocks were banned by the U.S. Justice Department in December 2018, with the regulation in effect as of March 2019.  Background   Location  The Las Vegas Strip is a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard immediately south of the city of Las Vegas in Clark County, Nevada. The Strip is known for its concentration of casinos and resort hotels, including the 43-story Mandalay Bay southwest of its intersection with Mandalay Bay Road, in the unincorporated town of Paradise. Las Vegas Village, a lot used for outdoor performances, is located diagonally across the intersection to the northeast. From 2014 onward, the venue hosted the annual Route 91 Harvest country music festival. The 2017 festival ran from September 29 to October 1, with over 22,000 attendees on the final day.  Perpetrator  Stephen Paddock was a 64-year-old former auditor and real estate businessman who had been living northeast of Las Vegas in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada. Paddock was a twice divorced atheist, had a long-term girlfriend, and had no known children. He was a son of Benjamin Paddock, a bank robber who was on the FBI's most-wanted list between 1969 and 1977. Paddock's only recorded interactions with law enforcement were traffic citations. Paddock was a high-stakes gambler who placed bets at a high enough level to earn valuable comps‚Äîfree benefits such as rooms and meals. He was a familiar figure to casino hosts in Las Vegas, but was not well known among other high-stakes gamblers because he mostly played video poker. He reportedly kept to himself and was a heavy drinker. Paddock had lost a significant amount of his wealth over the previous two years, but had paid off all gambling debts before the shooting.  Shooting   Preparation  According to his girlfriend, Paddock repeatedly cased out Las Vegas Village from different windows in their room when they stayed at the Mandalay Bay a month before the attack. Paddock also may have considered attacking previous events. He had researched large-scale venues in cities such as Boston since at least May 2017, and had reserved a room overlooking the August 2017 Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, but did not use it. From September 17, Paddock stayed at The Ogden in Downtown Las Vegas, which overlooked the open-air Life Is Beautiful festival that ran from September 22 to 24. Paddock's Internet search terms from mid-September included \\"swat weapons\\", \\"ballistics chart 308\\", \\"SWAT Las Vegas\\", and \\"do police use explosives\\". Paddock arrived at Mandalay Bay on September 25, 2017, and booked into Room 32-135, a complimentary room on the 32nd floor. Four days later, he also checked into the directly connected Room 32-134. Both suites overlook the site of the concert at Las Vegas Village. During his stay at Mandalay Bay, Paddock spent much of his time gambling, often at night. He interacted with employees more than ten times, including twice on the day of the shooting; an MGM Resorts International spokesperson said they were all \\"normal in nature\\". Cell phone records show that he also made multiple visits to his home in Mesquite. With frequent help from hotel bellmen, he brought five suitcases to his room on September 25, seven on the 26th, two on the 28th, on the 30th, and two on October 1. His arsenal of weapons, associated equipment and ammunition included fourteen AR-15 rifles (all of which were equipped with bump stocks and twelve of which had 100-round magazines), eight AR-10-type rifles, a bolt-action rifle, and a revolver. A bump stock modifies a semi-automatic weapon so that it can shoot in rapid succession, mimicking automatic fire. On September 30, he placed \\"Do not disturb\\" signs on the doors of both rooms.  Attack  Schematic of the shooting scene. Paddock indiscriminately fired rifle rounds from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel toward the concertgoers at Las Vegas Village. The mass shooting occurred between 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. on October 1, 2017, which was the third and final night of the festival. When the shooting began, country music singer Jason Aldean was giving the closing performance. Shortly before 10:00p.m., hotel security guard Jesus Campos was sent to the 32nd floor to investigate an open-door alert. He attempted to open a door that provided immediate access to the floor, but found that it would not open. After Campos entered the floor, he discovered an L-shaped bracket screwed into the door and door frame, which was responsible for barring the door from opening. After reporting the discovery to his dispatch center, he heard what he thought was the sound of rapid drilling coming from Room 32-135 and went to investigate the matter. At approximately 10:05, he was hit in the right thigh by one of about 35 bullets that Paddock fired through the door of his suite. After Campos was hit, he took cover in the alcove between Rooms 32-122 and 32-124 and immediately informed the hotel by radio and cellphone that he had been shot, though he believed he had been shot with a BB or pellet gun. At the same time, maintenance worker Stephen Schuck was on the same floor to fix the door that Campos had reported as being barricaded. Campos, who was already wounded, encountered Schuck and told him to take cover. Schuck contacted hotel dispatchers over his radio, informed them of the ongoing shooting, and told them to call the police. Neither the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department nor MGM Resorts International, the Mandalay Bay's owner, have confirmed when information about the initial shooting was relayed to the police. After Paddock used a hammer to break two of the windows in both of his suites, he began shooting through them at 10:05p.m. He ultimately fired over 1,000 rifle rounds approximately into the festival audience. He initially started out with a few single gunshots before firing in bursts that usually ranged from 80 rounds to 100 rounds. Many people in the crowd initially mistook the gunfire for fireworks. During the shooting, a security fence hindered concertgoers from fleeing the 15-acre concrete lot. The gunfire continued, with some momentary pauses, over the span of ten minutes and ended by 10:15p.m. In addition to shooting at the concertgoers, Paddock fired eight bullets at a large jet fuel tank at McCarran International Airport away. Two of those bullets struck the exterior of the tank, with one bullet penetrating the tank. The fuel did not explode because jet fuel is mostly kerosene, which is unlikely to ignite when struck by a bullet. During the shooting, police officers were initially confused whether the shots were coming from the Mandalay Bay, the nearby Luxor hotel, or the festival grounds. There were also multiple false reports of additional shooters at other hotels on the Strip. Officers eventually spotted multiple flashes of gunfire from the middle of the northern side of Mandalay Bay and responded to the hotel. At 10:12p.m., two officers on the 31st floor reported the sounds of gunfire on the floor above them. When officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17p.m. and encountered Campos a minute later, he directed them to Paddock's room and helped others evacuate. Campos was then directed to seek medical attention for himself. Between 10:26 and 10:30p.m., eight additional officers arrived at the 32nd floor; some of those officers manually breached through the door Paddock had screwed shut with the bracket. The gunfire had ceased, and the police moved systematically down the hallway, searching and clearing each room, using a master key that was provided by Campos. At 10:55p.m., the officers finished evacuating guests. At 11:20p.m., police breached Room 32-135 with explosives. Paddock was found dead on the floor from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Police then breached Room 32-134; while entering the hotel suite, an officer accidentally fired a three-round burst from his weapon, but the bullets did not hit anyone. At 11:27p.m., officers announced over the police radio that a suspect was down.  Immediate response  McCarran International Airport, adjacent to the shooting site, was shut down for several hours. Approximately 300 people entered the airport grounds as they fled from the shooting. This prompted officials to shut down all four runways. More than 25 flights were rerouted to ensure that no aircraft would be hit by gunfire, while other flights were canceled before airfield operations resumed at 12:40a.m. on October 2. Much of Las Vegas Boulevard was closed while police SWAT teams combed the venue and neighboring businesses. At approximately 2:45p.m. PDT on October 2, a state of emergency was declared in Clark County. Early on October 2, Sheriff Lombardo identified the suspect as .  Casualties   Fatalities  Fifty-eight people were fatally shot at the music festival; Paddock's suicide was the only death at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. The fatalities included 36 women and 22 men. The oldest victim was 67; the youngest was 20. Thirty-four were from California; six from Nevada; four from Canada; two each from Alaska and Utah; and one each from Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington state, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. The Clark County Coroner's Office determined that all 58 victims died as a result of gunshot wounds. Thirty-one of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene, while the twenty-seven others later succumbed to their wounds at the hospital, with the last of them dying on October 3, two days later. The incident was the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States, exceeding the death toll of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, in which 49 people lost their lives. A 57-year-old woman from California was paralyzed in the shooting and died on November 15, 2019, more than two years later. An autopsy was performed to establish the cause and manner of her death. On August 24, 2020, the San Bernardino County medical examiner officially attributed her death to the shooting, though the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) declined to include her in the official death toll. On September 17, 2020, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported the May 26 death of a 49-year-old Nevada woman who had been shot in the leg during the shooting; she died from complications ensuing from that wound. As with the woman who died in 2019, the LVMPD declined to include her in the death toll. However, the department backtracked on its decision on October 1, 2020, and included both women.  Injured  Approximately 867 people were injured, 411 of them with gunshot wounds or shrapnel injuries. In the aftermath, many victims were transported to area hospitals, which included University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center, and at least one of the six hospitals of Valley Health System. Sunrise Hospital treated the largest portion of the wounded: 199 patients, 150 of whom arrived within a timespan of about 40 minutes. University Medical Center treated 104 patients. Additionally, six victims sought medical treatment in Southern California; UC Irvine Medical Center treated four and Loma Linda University Medical Center treated two. Victims of the shooting required blood transfusions totaling 499 components in the first 24 hours of treatment, but this blood was rapidly replaced by available blood from local and national blood banks. University Medical Center, the Level I trauma center in Las Vegas, was difficult to access for the more than 50 percent of patients transported by private vehicles because Interstate 15, the most direct route from the shooting location, was closed to the public. Also, an erroneous emergency services announcement made one hour after the shooting reported UMC had reached capacity and was on diversion. This confusion persisted for several hours and led to most patients being transported to Sunrise, a Level II trauma center.  Surviving witnesses  Several people at the shooting were also present during the November 2018 mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, which left thirteen dead, including the gunman. One person said the number of Las Vegas survivors at the bar may have been as high as 60. It was confirmed that a survivor of the Las Vegas shooting died in the Thousand Oaks shooting.  Aftermath  The Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign adorned with flowers on October 9, 2017, a week after the shooting President Trump and First Lady Melania visit a hospitalized victim. On the morning after the shooting, lines to donate blood in Las Vegas stretched for blocks. Wait times were as much as six hours or more. In Las Vegas alone, 800 units of blood were donated to the local blood bank in the days following the shooting, and the American Red Cross reported a 53% increase in blood donation in the two days following the shooting. It was later reported that over 15% of the blood donated in Las Vegas after the shooting went unused, prompting questions about the benefit of widespread calls for blood donation following mass shootings. Millions of dollars have also been raised to help victims and their families. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval called the shooting \\"a tragic and heinous act of violence that has shaken the Nevada family\\". Jason Aldean, who was singing when the shooting started, posted his condolences on Instagram and noted all of those working with him at the show had survived the attack. At a press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump described Paddock as \\"a very very sick individual\\", and \\"a demented man, [with] a lot of problems\\". He added, \\"the police department has done such an incredible job, and we'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by\\". A White House official talking points memo, distributed to Trump allies, opposed tightening gun control since \\"new laws won't stop a mad man\\", but \\"will curtail the freedoms of law abiding citizens\\". On October 2, Trump issued a proclamation to honor the victims and their families. On October 4, Trump visited the shooting victims and first responders. A unity prayer walk and ceremony was held in Las Vegas on October 7 in honor of the dead. Speakers at the ceremony included Vice President Mike Pence and Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman. On the evening of October 15, thousands participated in a commemorative 3 mile walk between Circus Circus and Mandalay Bay. The annual Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Marathon took place on November 12 and was the largest event to be held in the city since the shooting. The event received a massive amount of security, which included 350 officers, counter-sniper surveillance posts, and a number of barriers composed of dump trucks, buses, and other large vehicles. The expansion Vegas Golden Knights of the NHL held a tribute to the victims and honored response personnel before their inaugural home game on October 10. Later during the season, the number 58 became the first number in team history to be retired, chosen for the 58 deaths during the shooting. The future of the Las Vegas Village remained undetermined until September 2019. MGM Resorts International intends to create a community center, which will host sporting events. In March 2019, nearly a year and a half after the shooting, a Las Vegas police officer who was revealed to have been in the 31st floor of the Mandalay Bay, directly underneath Paddock, during the incident but did not immediately respond to the gunfire was fired for his decision to remain in the hallway. However, following an arbitrator's ruling, the officer was reinstated a year later.https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2020-03-13/vegas-officer-fired- for-inaction-in-2017-massacre-reinstated  Misinformation, fake news, and conspiracy theories  Following the shooting, misinformation, and fake news about the shooter's identity and motive went viral on social media: * A 4chan /pol/ thread, which misidentified the shooter and described him as a registered Democrat, briefly featured in the \\"Top Stories\\" section of a Google search for the shooter's name. This was further circulated by a number of websites, including The Gateway Pundit. * The fake news website Your News Wire spread false information about a second gunman purportedly shooting from the fourth floor of the hotel. * Two of Facebook's top trending pages were items from Sputnik, a Russian government news agency. These included one story that falsely claimed the FBI had linked the shooter to a terrorist group. The stories were later removed from Sputnik with an apology. * Stories linking the shooter to the Antifa movement have also been discredited. * The terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) claimed that Paddock was its \\"soldier\\" and that he had answered Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's call to attack coalition countries' citizens. ISIS provided no evidence for its claim, and had previously released multiple false claims of responsibility for incidents with which it had no known connection. On October 9, 2017, the FBI declared that Paddock's attack was not linked to international terrorism. Google and Facebook were criticized for displaying such false news stories in some of their search results. The two technology companies were said to have failed in their responsibility of keeping these from reaching the public. Facebook later said its algorithms were designed to detect and remove false stories, but failed to work adequately in this instance. Survivors of the shooting have been accused of being crisis actors, and some have received death threats on social media. Conspiracy theorists have claimed that there were multiple shooters and that details of the massacre are being covered up for the sake of promoting gun control laws. After some media outlets reported that YouTube search results for information about the shooting returned links to conspiracy videos, YouTube said it had tweaked its search algorithm to promote news sources which it considered more authoritative. Some experts have said the removal of this content ironically fuels conspiracy theories by making a cover-up seem evident.  Gun control discussion  The shooting prompted support in the U.S. Congress for assault weapons legislation that would ban bump stocks. Many Congressional Democrats and some Republicans expressed support. House leaders said the issue of bump stock regulation should be decided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which originally approved bump stocks. The National Rifle Association (NRA) came out in favor of administrative bump fire stock regulations. Firearms retailers reported increased consumer interest in bump stocks. On November 6, 2017, Massachusetts became the first state to ban the sale, possession, or use of the devices. In December 2018, Acting United States Attorney General Matthew Whitaker signed a regulation banning bump stocks in the U.S., effective March 2019. The regulation bans new sales and requires current owners to surrender or destroy existing bump stocks. Eighteen Democratic U.S. Senators introduced a bill, the Keep Americans Safe Act, which would ban gun magazines that hold more than ten rounds of ammunition. Stock prices of firearms manufacturers rose the day after the shooting, as has happened after similar incidents. Investors expected gun sales to increase over concerns that such an event could lead to more stringent gun-control legislation, and possibly due to a rush of customers wishing to defend themselves against future attacks, but firearm sales did not increase after the shooting.  Legal action  In November 2017, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of 450 of the victims of the shooting, which claimed that the Mandalay Bay Hotel had shown negligence by allowing Paddock to bring a large amount of weaponry into the building. In July 2018, MGM Resorts International countersued hundreds of victims, claiming that it had \\"no liability of any kind\\" for the attack. On October 3, 2019, MGM Resorts reached a settlement of $800 million with the victims of the shooting, which was approved by a judge on September 30, 2020.  Bravery awards  A British soldier, Trooper Ross Woodward, from the 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards, who was visiting a nearby hotel while off-duty when the shooting began, was awarded the Queen's Commendation for Bravery for his actions during the event. His citation stated that \\"he consciously, deliberately and repeatedly advanced towards danger, moving people to safety and treating casualties\\". Navy Petty Officer First Class Brian Mazi, who was attending the event with his wife, was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his actions. A detective with the Rhode Island State Police, Conor O'Donnell, who was attending the event with his girlfriend, was awarded a service ribbon for his actions. Assistant Scoutmaster Martin Heffernan was honored by Boy Scouts of America for demonstrating unusual heroism and extraordinary skill in saving or attempting to save a life at extreme risk to self with the Honor Award with Crossed Palms. Sgt. Chasen Brown with the Utah National Guard was awarded the Medal of Valor for saving at least half a dozen other concert-goers. For 60-90 minutes after the shooting stopped, he continued to help render aid and assessed casualties.  Investigation  According to authorities with the Clark County Commission, the name \\"1 October\\" was declared the official title for investigations into the mass shooting.  Early reports  Investigators found hidden surveillance cameras that were placed inside and outside the hotel room, presumably so Paddock could monitor the arrival of others. The cameras were not in record mode. Police said a handwritten note found in the room indicated Paddock had been calculating the distance, wind, and trajectory from his 32nd floor hotel suite to the concertgoers he was targeting on the festival lot. At a press conference on October 4, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo stated there was evidence‚Äîwhich he declined to discuss‚Äîthat Paddock intended to escape the scene, and that he may have had assistance from an accomplice. Investigators searched Paddock's room and found a \\"bulletproof vest\\" and breathing apparatus, neither of which were used by Paddock. There have been several changes in the official account and timeline of Paddock's shooting of hotel security guard Campos. Police officials described these adjustments as \\"minute changes\\" that are common in complex investigations. In their first statement about the incident, police officials inaccurately reported that Campos arrived on the scene after Paddock began firing into the crowd. In a second statement, police officials reported, again inaccurately, that Campos was shot six minutes before Paddock began firing into the crowd. That report had been based on a 9:59 p.m. notation in a hotel security log, which in a third statement was determined to have been the time when Campos encountered the barricaded door. Sheriff Lombardo dismissed allegations that the changing timeline was the result of some kind of conspiracy between the police department, the FBI, and MGM Resorts International saying, \\"Nobody is attempting to hide anything in reference to this investigation. The dynamics and the size of this investigation requires us to go through voluminous amounts of information in order to draw an accurate picture.\\"  Preliminary investigation  The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department released a preliminary report on the event on January 18, 2018. Police speculate that Paddock acted alone and have not determined his motive. No links have been identified to any hate groups, terrorist groups or ideologies, and he did not record a reason for his actions. On February 2, 2018, Douglas Haig, an Arizona ammunition dealer, was charged in a Nevada federal court with \\"conspiracy to manufacture and sell armor-piercing ammunition without a license\\" after his fingerprints were discovered on unfired armor-piercing ammunition inside Paddock's suite. He was sentenced in June 2020 to 13 months in prison.  Final investigative report  On August 3, 2018, Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo held a press conference on the release of the \\"LVMPD Criminal Investigative Report of the 1 October Mass Casualty Shooting\\". He said the 10-month investigation had revealed no evidence of conspiracy or a second gunman, and that the gunman's motive had not been definitely determined. Lombardo said \\"What we have been able to answer are the questions of who, what, when, where and how... what we have not been able to definitively answer is why Stephen Paddock committed this act.\\" A report published by the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit in January 2019 said that \\"there was no single or clear motivating factor\\" for the shooting.  Weaponry  Twenty-four firearms, a large quantity of ammunition, and numerous high-capacity magazines capable of holding up to 100 rounds apiece were found in the suite. Fourteen of the firearms were .223-caliber AR-15-type semi-automatic rifles: three manufactured by Colt, two by Daniel Defense, two by FN Herstal, two by LWRC International, two by POF-USA, one with a .223 Wylde chamber by Christensen Arms, one made-to-order by LMT, and one by Noveske. The others were eight .308-caliber AR-10-type rifles, one .308-caliber Ruger American bolt-action rifle, and one .38-caliber Smith & Wesson Model 342 revolver. The AR-15 rifles were fitted with vertical forward grips and bump fire stocks, the latter of which allowed for recoil to actuate their triggers at a rate of 90 rounds in 10 seconds. The AR-10 rifles were equipped with various telescopic sights and mounted on bipods. Paddock was found to have fired a total of 1,058 rounds from fifteen of the firearms: 1,049 from twelve AR-15-style rifles, eight from two AR-10-style rifles, and the round used to kill himself from the Smith & Wesson revolver. During the subsequent investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that the firearms found in his hotel room, along with more guns found in his homes, had been legally purchased in Nevada, California, Texas, and Utah. In the month preceding the shooting, he had attempted to purchase tracer ammunition, but the gun dealer he approached did not have the item in stock. He bought tracer ammunition from a private seller at a Phoenix, Arizona gun show. In addition, ammonium nitrate (often used in improvised explosive devices) was found in the trunk of his Hyundai Tucson SUV, along with 1,600 rounds of ammunition and of Tannerite, a binary explosive used to make explosive targets for gun ranges. Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said that while Paddock had \\"nefarious intent\\" with the material, he did not appear to have assembled an explosive device.

The actomyosin ring follows an orderly sequence of events: identification of the active division site, formation of the ring, constriction of the ring, and disassembly of the ring. It is composed of actin and myosin II bundles, thus the term actomyosin. The actomyosin ring operates in contractile motion,Munjal, Akankshi and Lecuit, Thomas. (2014).

Corporal punishment of minor children by parents or adult guardians, which is any punishment intended to cause physical pain, has been traditionally legal in nearly all countries unless explicitly outlawed. According to a 2014 estimate by Human Rights Watch, \\"Ninety percent of the world‚Äôs children live in countries where corporal punishment and other physical violence against children is still legal\\".\\"25th Anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child\\". Human Rights Watch. 17 November 2014. Many countries' laws provide for a defence of \\"reasonable chastisement\\" against charges of assault and other crimes for parents using corporal punishment. This defence is ultimately derived from English law. Prohibition Countries (or territories) that have completely prohibited corporal punishment of children are listed below (in chronological order): (1979) (1983) (1989) (1994) (1997) (1997) (1998) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2000) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2007) (2007) (2007) (2007) (2007) (2007) (2007) (2008) (2008) (2008) (2008) (2010) (2010) (2010) (2010) (2010) (2011) (2013) (2013) (2013) (2014) (2014) (2014) (2014) (2014) (2014) (2014) (2014) (2015) (2015) (2015) (2016) (2016) (2016) ' (2016) (2016) (2017) (2018) ' (2019) (2019) (2019) ' (2019) (2020) (2020) ' (2020) (2020) ' (2022) Laws by country Argentina Banned in 1813, school corporal punishment was re-legalised in 1817 and punishments by physical pain lasted until the 1980s.

The Australian state of Tasmania is continuing to review the state's laws on the matter, and may seek to ban the use of corporal punishment by parents. The matter is also under review in other Australian states. A 2002 public opinion survey suggested the majority view was in support of retaining parents' right to smack with the open hand but not with an implement,Malpeli, Gareth, \\"Change smack law: group\\", The West Australian, Perth, 12 July 2002. although , there are no laws against using an implement in any state or territory. In New South Wales, S61AA of the Crimes Act (1900) allows a parent a defence of lawful correction.\\"Crimes Act 1900‚ÄîSect. 61AA\\". New South Wales Consolidated Acts. In New South Wales, you specifically cannot smack a child on the head or neck, and the child cannot be more than briefly harmed or bruised.\\"Spank a child in New South Wales\\" Austria School corporal punishment was explicitly prohibited in Austria in 1974. In 1977, corporal punishment in the home was outlawed by removing the section in the constitution of assault in the Penal Code that stated that parents who have used \\"reasonable punishment\\" of their children shall not be punished for assault. On 15 March 1989, corporal punishment of children became explicitly banned through a new law stating that \\"using violence and inflicting physical or mental suffering is unlawful\\". Canada In Canada, parents may use physical force to discipline their children, including spanking, but there are several restrictions. Section 43 of the Criminal Code provides that parents may use \\"reasonable\\" force as a form of discipline. The constitutionality of this provision was challenged in the courts, on the basis that it infringed the rights of children, contrary to three sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: the right to security of the person, protected by section 7 of the Charter; the right to be free from cruel and unusual treatment and punishment, protected by section 12 of the Charter; and the right to equality (specifically, age), protected by section 15 of Charter. In 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the constitutional challenge on all grounds, on a 6-3 split, in Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada. In upholding section 43, the majority of the Court provided considerable guidance to the interpretation of the provision. The majority held that the person administering the discipline must be a parent or legal guardian, or in some cases, a school teacher (i.e. non-parental relatives such as grandparents, aunts, or uncles, as well as babysitters and other caretakers, are banned from spanking); that the force must be used \\"by way of correction\\" (sober, reasoned uses of force that address the actual behaviour of the child and are designed to restrain, control or express some symbolic disapproval of his or her behaviour), that the child must be capable of benefiting from the correction (i.e. not under the age of 2 or over 12), and that the use of force must be \\"reasonable under the circumstances\\", meaning that it results neither in harm nor in the prospect of bodily harm. Punishment involving slaps or blows to the head is harmful, the Court held.Canadian Press, \\"Top court upholds spanking law\\", Toronto Star, 31 January 2004. Use of any implement other than a bare hand is illegal and hitting a child in anger or in retaliation for something a child did is not considered reasonable and is against the law. The Court defined \\"reasonable\\" as force that would have a \\"transitory and trifling\\" impact on the child. For example, spanking or slapping a child so hard that it leaves a mark that lasts for several hours would not be considered \\"transitory and trifling\\".Canadian Law, \\"The Criminal Law and Managing Children's Behaviour\\", Department of Justice, 1 December 2011. Among the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, formed to redress the legacy of the Canadian Indian residential school system, is a call to repeal Section 43 of the Criminal Code. Denmark Corporal punishment in schools in Denmark became explicitly prohibited in 1967 and in 1985, parents' right to use corporal punishment of their children became outlawed through a new law which required parents \\"to protect their child from physical and psychological violence and other humiliating treatment\\". However, the law was believed to still support corporal punishment as there was a controversy whether the law permitted parents to punish their children physically or otherwise.http://viden.jp.dk/binaries/syddjurs%208%20kl_15801.pdf Therefore, after several years of debate, a new more clear law came into force on 28 May 1997, providing that \\"The child has right to care and security. It must be treated with respect for its person and must not be subjected to corporal punishment or other humiliating treatment\\". However, its autonomous countries Faroe Islands and Greenland banned corporal punishment of children in 2007 and 2016 respectively. Finland School corporal punishment was banned in 1914. Parents' right to use corporal punishment of their children was outlawed in 1969 when the section in the constitution of assault in the Penal Code, stating that a \\"petty assault\\" was not punishable if committed by parents or others who exercise their right to chastise a child, was removed. In 1983, corporal punishment of children was explicitly banned. France In the Napoleonic era parents were explicitly allowed to physically punish their children. Spanking was previously popular, with 85% of French parents admitting to using it. However, in 2019, the National Assembly approved a bill introducing a complete ban on all forms of physical punishment of children and required mayors officiating at civil weddings to remind couples that violence against children is unlawful. The law makes corporal punishment a civil offense not criminal. Germany School corporal punishment was prohibited in East Germany (which became a part of the Federal Republic of Germany at the German reunification on 3 October 1990) and in the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany before the German reunification on 3 October 1990), it became prohibited at different times in its states between 1975 and 1983. In the Federal Republic of Germany, in 1980 it became prohibited for parents to educate their children with \\"degrading measures\\" (however, it was not clear exactly what \\"degrading\\" meant), of which the common interpretation was that corporal punishment of children was still permitted as long as it was not \\"degrading\\". On 1 July 1998, corporal punishment was outlawed through a new law stating that \\"Degrading educational measures, especially physical and psychological maltreatment, are inadmissible\\"; however, the common interpretation of that law was that parents still had some right to use corporal punishment of their children. Therefore, on 8 November 2000, that law was replaced with a new more clear and strict law stating that \\"Children have right to a non-violent upbringing. Corporal punishment, psychological violence and other degrading educational measures are inadmissible.\\". Ireland In Ireland, all forms of corporal punishment of children have been definitively outlawed since the passing of the Children First Act 2015. Law in the Republic of Ireland inherited the pre-independence common law and statutes modelled on English law. These included allowance under common law of \\"physical chastisement\\" by teachers, and under the Children Act 1908 of \\"reasonable chastisement\\" by parents and those in loco parentis. School corporal punishment was prohibited in 1982 by an administrative decision of John Boland, the Minister for Education. Teachers were not liable to criminal prosecution until 1997, when the rule of law allowing physical chastisement was explicitly abolished. The Children Act 2001 repealed the 1908 act but, except in children detention schools, did not explicitly prohibit corporal punishment; the common-law defence of \\"reasonable chastisement\\" remained available to parents facing a charge of assault. In response to a complaint filed with the European Committee of Social Rights, the defence was abolished under the Children First Act 2015. * ; * ; * Italy School corporal punishment became prohibited in 1928. In 1996, the Supreme Court of Italy ruled that in domestic settings, physical punishment is no longer an acceptable way to discipline children. However, that is still yet to be confirmed in legislation.\\"Country report for Italy\\". Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children. May 2015. Nepal In September 2018, Nepal adopted the \\"Children's act 2018\\" which criminalises corporal punishment of children in all settings. New Zealand The Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007 or \\"anti-smacking bill\\" was introduced as a private members bill by Green Party Member of Parliament Sue Bradford in 2005 passed on its third reading on 16 May 2007 by 113 votes to eight. The 2009 New Zealand citizens-initiated referendum posed the question: \\"Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?\\" 87.4% of votes answered \\"No\\". The referendum was non-binding and did not lead to a change in the law. Norway School corporal punishment was explicitly prohibited in 1936. In 1972, an 1891 law that gave parents some right to use corporal punishment of their children was removed from the constitution of assault in the Penal Code, which made corporal punishment of children unlawful and punishable as assault. In order to clarify that violence towards children is not allowed, an explicit ban on corporal punishment of children came into force in 1987. However, the Supreme Court of Norway ruled in 2005 that a light \\"careful slap\\" applied immediately after the \\"offence\\" was still allowed.Tisdall, Jonathan, \\"Supreme Court upholds spanking ban\\" , Aftenposten English web desk, Oslo, 30 November 2005.\\"About corporal punishment\\", The Ombudsman for Children in Norway, 30 September 2008. Retrieved 8 August 2009. The legislature abolished this in 2010, and the current law is that any violence against children, including \\"careful slaps\\", is prohibited. Poland In 1783, Poland became the world's first country to outlaw school corporal punishment. According to article 40 in the 1997 Constitution of Poland, \\"No one may be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. The application of corporal punishment shall be prohibited.\\". However, there was a controversy whether parents' right to use corporal punishment of their children was supported by law or not, until 2010, when it became explicitly prohibited. South Africa Common-law precedent in South Africa held that a parent may \\"inflict moderate and reasonable chastisement\\" on a child. The judicial corporal punishment of juveniles was forbidden by the Constitutional Court in the 1995 case S v Williams. Corporal punishment in schools was banned by the South African Schools Act, 1996, and the application of that ban to private religious schools was upheld by the Constitutional Court in the case of Christian Education South Africa v Minister of Education. In 2013 the Department of Social Development prepared legislation to prohibit corporal punishment in the home. In 2017 a decision by the Gauteng High Court held that corporal punishment in the home was unlawful, and that decision was confirmed for the whole country by the Constitutional Court in the 2019 case Freedom of Religion South Africa v Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development. South Korea In South Korea, Article 915 of the Civil Act 1958 provides adults the \\"right to take disciplinary action\\". Laws against violence and abuse are not generally interpreted as prohibiting corporal punishment of children.\\"Country report for Republic of Korea\\". Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children. Retrieved January 2016. Sweden :See also Corporal punishment in the home#Swedish ban. Sweden was the world's first nation to outlaw all corporal punishment of children in 1966, when the law that permitted parents to use corporal punishment of their children became removed and fully replaced with the constitution of assault under the Penal Code; however, even though the law no longer supported parents' right to use physical punishment of their children, it was believed to still be permitted (as there was no explicit ban). School corporal punishment was already banned since 1958. On 1 July 1979, Sweden became the world's first nation to explicitly ban corporal punishment of children, through an amendment to the Parenthood and Guardianship Code which stated, \\"Children are entitled to care, security and a good upbringing. Children are to be treated with respect for their person and individuality and may not be subjected to corporal punishment or any other humiliating treatment.\\"\\"Corporal Punishment\\" (2008). International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Corporal punishment in Sweden does not usually carry a criminal penalty, unless it meets the criteria for assault. One thing that helped pave the way for the ban was a 1971 murder case where a 3-year-old girl was beaten to death by her stepfather. The case shook the general public and preventing child abuse became a political hot topic for years to come.https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&artikel;=6194562 It is estimated that approximately 5% of Swedish children continue to be illegally spanked, however, in addition to being unlawful, physical punishment of children is now considered socially unacceptable. Turkey =Simple Form= In Turkey, corporal punishment is unlawful, considered assault, and is punishable by imprisonment for a term not less than 1 year and not more than 3 years if none of the special cases below occur.Turkish Penal Code, Article 86/1 =Special Cases= If the courts deem that any one of: 1. \\"the victim is physically or psychologically unable to defend themselves\\", 2. the victim is the child of the perpetrator, or, 3. a weapon (which is defined to include \\"anything used in defense or offense\\"Turkish Penal Code, Article 6/1/f) is used in the act is true, the punishment is increased by half of the original amount.Turkish Penal Code, Article 86/3/b,a,e If the courts deem that the perpetrator acted in a \\"fiendish\\" way, the punishment is increased to twice the original amount.Turkish Penal Code, Article 86/3/f If either one or both of these are true, it is said that the act was \\"egregious\\".Turkish Penal Code, Article 86/3 If the victim suffers, as a result of corporal punishment being used on them, any one of: 1. persistent weakness in any of their senses or organs, 2. persistent hardship in speaking, 3. a permanent mark on their face, or, 4. a danger to their life, the punishment determined above is increased to twice its final amount (determined above.)Turkish Penal Code, Article 87/1/a,b,c,d However, the final punishment if these occur, cannot be less than imprisonment for a term of 3 years, or 5 years if the act was deemed to be \\"egregious\\".Turkish Penal Code, Article 87/1 Alternatively, if the victim, as a result of corporal punishment being used on them, any one of: 1. begins to suffer from an illness for which there is no cure, or, enters a persistent vegetative state, 2. suffers a complete loss of function to one of their senses or organs, 3. loses the ability to speak or to reproduce, or, 4. a permanent change to their face, the punishment determined above is increased to thrice its final amount (determined above.)Turkish Penal Code, Article 87/2/a,b,c,d However, the final punishment if these occur, cannot be less than imprisonment for a term of 5 years, or 8 years if the act was deemed to be \\"egregious\\".Turkish Penal Code, Article 87/2 If the victim suffers a broken bone as a result of corporal punishment being used on them, the courts may increase the final punishment by up to half its original amount, depending on the vitality of the broken bone to daily life.Turkish Penal Code, Article 87/3 If the victim dies as a result of corporal punishment being used on them but the act does not meet the criteria for murder, the final punishment must be imprisonment for a term not less than 8 years and not more than 12 years. If the act was found to be \\"egregious\\", the term of imprisonment must be between 12 and 18 years. Turkish Penal Code, Article 87/4 United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, domestic corporal punishment varies by jurisdiction. = England = Criminal law has a general prohibition against common assault and battery, but corporal punishment is legal through tradition and an implicit common law justification/defence (R v Hopley 2F&F; 202, 1860\\"By the law of England, a parent [repealled - referred to school teachers] may for the purpose of correcting what is evil in the child inflict moderate and reasonable corporal punishment, always, however, with this condition, that it is moderate and reasonable.\\" Chief Justice Lord Cockburn, CJ in case R v Hopley 2F&F; 202 (1860)) to such charges for parents striking their children in the context of \\"lawful correction\\" where the act is \\"moderate and reasonable\\". The Children Act 2004 effectively provides a statutory definition of immoderate by disallowing this justification for any act of punishment inflicting injuries or effects that amount to wounding, actual bodily harm (ABH), or any act considered \\"cruelty to persons under sixteen\\" in violation of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 and was described at implementation as criminalising \\"visible bruising\\"\\"Smacking ban introduced\\", The Daily Telegraph, London, 15 January 2005. and rendering lesser injuries (comparable to \\"not serious\\" common assault) implicitly lawful/defensible. At the time, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) produced a charging standard unlawfully asserting the age of the victim may be considered an aggravating factor in deciding if the offence charged would be indefensible serious assault occasioning ABH rather than (implicitly defensible) common assault and erroneousely asserted that any injuries more than \\"temporary reddening of the skin\\" or \\"marks\\" could be charged as ABH: this had no legal basis and was withdrawn in 2011. Standards now correctly require evidence of injuries that are \\"serious\\" and where a \\"sentence clearly in excess of six months' imprisonment ought to be available\\" (as legal precedent requires/demands injuries \\"must, no doubt, be more than merely transient and trifling\\" now being interpreted as \\"more than common assault\\") to warrant an indefensible criminal charge of ABH. Utilising the unlawful threshold, the courts of England and Wales have convicted parents on the basis their acts amounted to ABH and was therefore unlawful yet have passed sentences less than six months, contrary to the requirement it be more than six months; police and social services also continue to use the long withdrawn assertions of the CPS, leading to many parents or others acting in loco parentis being criminalised (often be police cautions for lesser common assault on a position of guilt to ABH) or investigated for causing minor injuries that did not amount to ABH in law.Example FOI response from Dyfed Powys Police (PDF), \\"FOI Response\\", April 2016.Children are unbeatable newsletter (PDF), \\"CAU-Issue 18\\", April 2016. The total abolition of corporal punishment has been discussed.Curtis, Polly, \\"Smacking law to be reviewed\\", The Guardian, London, 16 June 2007. In a 2004 poll by the advocacy group Children are Unbeatable!, 71% of respondents supported giving children the same protection against battery as adults if it \\"would not lead to parents being prosecuted for trivial or minor acts of physical punishment\\". In a 2006 survey, 80% of the population said they believed in smacking, and 73% said that they believed that any ban would cause a sharp deterioration in children's behaviour. Seven out of ten parents said they themselves use corporal punishment.Bennett, Rosemary, \\"Majority of parents admit to smacking children\\", The Times, London, 20 September 2006. In a 2012 poll conducted by Angus Reid Public Opinion, 63 per cent of Britons voiced opposition to banning parents in the UK from smacking their children.Canseco, Mario, \\"Britons Opposed to Banning Parents from Smacking Their Children\\" , Angus Reid Public Opinion, London, 13 February 2012. In 2019, Wales announced a bill was put forward to end all corporal punishment in Wales. =Wales= The Welsh Government introduced a Bill to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment in Wales. On 20 March 2020 the Welsh Assembly passed the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Act 2020. This law will come into force in 2022. This change in the law gives children the same legal protection from assault as adults and will come into force in 2022 to \\"ensure everyone is ready for the change.\\" =Scotland = In Scotland, since 2003 it has been unlawful to punish a child using any implement, or to strike them upon the head and corporal punishment of children under the age of 3 is unlawful. In 2017, the Scottish Government confirmed it would support a member's bill to ban all corporal punishment completely. On 3 October 2019, the bill was backed in the Scottish Parliament by 84 votes to 29 making Scotland the first U.K. jurisdiction to ban all forms of corporal punishment. =Northern Ireland= In Northern Ireland, laws regarding corporal punishment are similar to England. It is unlawful to hit a child upon the head or use an implement. United States Corporal punishment of children by parents is legal to some extent in all fifty of the United States, and is explicitly legal according to the state laws of forty-nine states (all except Minnesota). Social acceptance is generally high, through allowances made for \\"moderate physical discipline\\" (using this or similar language) in most states' laws regarding assault, criminal battery, domestic violence or child abuse. Whether an instance of corporal punishment exceeds these bounds is usually decided on a case-by-case basis in family court proceedings.

Bligh named the highest hill on the island Mount Cornwallis.Matthew Flinders, A Voyage to Terra Australis, (W Bulmer and Co, London, 1814)Singe, 67 Because of its distance from the main sea passages in Torres Strait, few Europeans had visited Dauan prior to the 1860s.Mullins, 21 Torres Strait Islanders refer to the arrival of the London Missionary Society on 1 July 1871 as \\"the Coming of the Light\\". After visiting Erub and Tudu, missionaries led by the Reverend Samuel McFarlane and the Reverend A W Murray travelled to Dauan on 6 July 1871. Nadai, the leader of Dauan, met with the missionaries and allowed them to start a mission on the island. Two South Sea Islander lay pastors named Josaia and Sivene were appointed to work as missionary teachers at Dauan and Saibai. LMS missionaries revisited Dauan and Saibai in 1872, and found that Josaia and Sivene had been accepted by the Islanders and given land by the local chiefs.Singe, 6, 179-182Sharp, 100Mullins, 7, 121 In the 1860s, beche-de-mer (sea cucumber) and pearling boats began working the reefs of Torres Strait. Pearling bases were never established on Dauan; but in the 1870s, European pearl and beche-de-mer operators began recruiting men from the North Western Islands to work on their luggers.Mullins, 7, 65 From the late 1870s onwards, the coastal communities of Papua and the islands of Dauan, Boigu and Saibai were raided by warriors of the Marind-Anim or Tugeri people from Dutch-controlled West Papua. In 1881, the government vessel known as the Pearl visited Dauan and found that the entire population of Boigu had taken shelter on the island from Marind Anim raiding parties who had killed 11 Islanders and burned the villages on Boigu. Dauan was often used as a place of sanctuary by the people of Boigu and Saibai, as it was surrounded by reefs and strong currents which were difficult for the raiders to negotiate in their canoes. Government officials Henry Chester and Frank Jardine lead a punitive expedition against the raiders but were unable to find them. Chester left a quantity of firearms with the people of Boigu for their self- defence.Queensland State Archives, Colonial Secretary‚Äôs Correspondence, COL/A305, 1881/154Raven, 4, 131. In 1896, a retaliatory expedition led by British officials based in Daru in West Papua diminished the threat of the Marind-Anim, but raids on Dauan, Boigu, Saibai and Papua continued well into the 1920s.Mullins, 7, 146-148Singe, 6, 74-76, 83 In 1872, the Queensland Government sought to extend its jurisdiction and requested the support of the British Government.S B Kaye, Jurisdictional Patchwork: Law of the Sea and Native Title Issues in the Torres Strait (2001) 2 Melbourne Journal of International Law, 1 Letters Patent were issued by the British Government in 1872 creating a new colony, which encompassed all islands within a 60 nautical mile radius of the coast of Queensland.Queensland, Queensland Statutes (1963) vol.2, 712 This boundary was further extended by the Queensland Coast Islands Act 1879 (Qld) and now included the islands of Boigu, Erub, Mer and Saibai, which lay beyond the previous 60 nautical mile limit.See also Colonial Boundaries Act 1895 (Imp)Wacando v Commonwealth (1981) 148 CLR 1 The new legislation enabled the Queensland Government to control and regulate bases for the beche-de-mer and pearling industries which had previously operated outside its jurisdiction.Mullins, 7, 139-161 Around 1900, a member of the London Missionary Society, Reverend Walker, established a philanthropic business scheme named Papuan Industries Limited (PIL). This business encouraged Islander communities to co-operatively rent or purchase their own pearl luggers or \\"company boats\\". The boats were used to harvest pearl shells and beche-de-mer, which were sold and distributed by the company. The people of Dauan had purchased their first company boat the Papua by 1911. Company boats provided Islanders with income and a sense of community pride and also improved transport and communication between the islands.R Ganter, The Pearl Shellers of Torres Strait (Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, 1994) 68-75Queensland, Annual Report of the Chief Protector of Aboriginals for 1911 (1912) 22Sharp, 7, 158-161Boigu Community Council, 4, 132-134 In November 1912, the Queensland Government officially gazetted 800 acres of land on Dauan as an Aboriginal reserve. Many other Torres Strait Islands were gazetted as Aboriginal reserves at this time.Queensland, Queensland Government Gazette, vol.99, no.138 (1912) 1330 Shortages of food on Dauan and Saibai were mentioned in a government report dating from 1912. The report also stated that only 12 to 15 people were living at Dauan permanently.Queensland, Annual Report of the Chief Protector of Aboriginals for 1912(1913) 26. By 1918, a Protector of Aboriginals had been appointed to Thursday Island and, during the 1920s and 1930s, racial legislation was strictly applied to Torres Strait Islanders. In the 1930s, a mission school was established. In 1936, around 70% of the Torres Strait Islander workforce went on strike in the first organised challenge against government authority made by Torres Strait Islanders. The nine-month strike was an expression of Islanders‚Äô anger and resentment at the increasing government control of their livelihood. The strike was a protest against government interference in wages, trade and commerce and called for the lifting of evening curfews, the removal of the permit system for inter- island travel, and the recognition of the Islanders‚Äô right to recruit their own boat crews.Sharp, 8, 181-186, 278J Beckett, 54 The strike produced a number of significant reforms and innovations. Unpopular local Protector J D McLean was removed and replaced by Cornelius O‚ÄôLeary, who established a system of regular consultations with elected Islander council representatives. The new island councils were given a degree of autonomy including control over local island police and courts.Beckett, 19, 54-55 On 23 August 1937, O‚ÄôLeary convened the first Inter Islander Councillors Conference at Masig. Representatives from 14 Torres Strait communities attended. Mau and Anau represented Dauan at the conference. After lengthy discussions, unpopular bylaws, including the evening curfews, were cancelled and a new code of local representation was agreed upon.Sharp, 8, 210-214Queensland State Archives, A/3941 Minutes of Torres Strait Councillors Conference held at Yorke Island 23‚Äì25 August 1937 In 1939 the Queensland Government passed the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1939, which incorporated many of the recommendations discussed at the conference. The Act officially recognised Torres Strait Islanders as a separate people from Aboriginal Australians.Queensland, Annual Report of the Department of Native Affairs for 1939(1940) 1Sharp, 7, 214-216 During World War II, the Australian Government recruited Torres Strait Islander men to serve in the armed forces. Enlisted men from Dauan and other island communities formed the Torres Strait Light Infantry. While the Torres Strait Light Infantry were respected as soldiers, they only received one third of the pay given to white Australian servicemen. On 31 December 1943, members of the Torres Strait Light Infantry went on strike calling for equal pay and equal rights for all soldiers. The Australian Government agreed to increase their pay to two thirds the level received by white servicemen. Full back pay was offered in compensation to the Torres Strait servicemen by the Australian Government in the 1980s.J Beckett, 19, 64-65Australian War Memorial website, Wartime Issue 12 ‚ÄòOne Ilan Man‚Äô, http://www.awm.gov.au/wartime/12/article.aspBoigu Community Council, 5, 89-100. In the post-war period, the pearling industry declined across Torres Strait, and Islanders were permitted to work and settle on Thursday Island and the Australian mainland. After gaining its independence from Australia in 1975, Papua New Guinea asserted its right to the islands and waters of the Torres Straits. In December 1978, a treaty was signed by the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments that described the boundaries between the two countries and the use of the sea area by both parties.For further information see Australia, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website: www.dfat.gov.au/geo/torres_strait/index.html#briefSharp, 7, 226-227 Commencing in February 1985, the Torres Strait Treaty, contains special provision for free movement (without passports or visas) between both countries.Under Article 11. Free movement between communities applies to traditional activities such as fishing, trading and family gatherings which occur in a specifically created Protected Zone and nearby areas.See also Article 12 On 29 January 1985, the Queensland Government established Dauan Island State School. In 2007 the Tagai State College was established and Dauan Island State School became the Dauan Island Campus of the Tagai State College.  Local government  On 30 March 1985, the Dauan community elected 3 councillors to constitute an autonomous Dauan Island Council established under the Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984. The Act conferred local government-type powers and responsibilities upon Torres Strait Islander councils and the council area, previously an Aboriginal reserve held by the Queensland Government, was transferred on 21 October 1985 to the trusteeship of the council under a Deed of Grant in Trust.Queensland, Annual Report of the Department of Community Services for 1986 (1987) 3Queensland, Annual Report of the Department of Community Services for 1987 (1988) 29 In 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission recommended that the 15 Torres Strait Island councils be abolished and the Torres Strait Island Regional Council (TSIRC) be established in their place. In elections conducted under the Local Government Act 1993 on 15 March 2008, members of the 15 communities comprising the Torres Strait Island Regional Council local government area each voted for a local councillor and a mayor to constitute a council consisting of 15 councillors plus a mayor. Torres Strait Island Regional Council operate an Indigenous Knowledge Centre at Main Street on Dauan.  Education  In 2016, the Dauan campus of the Tagai State College had an enrolment of 18 students in Early Years and 21 student in Middle Years (total 39).  Religion  In 2018, a parish on Dauan Island became the first in the Torres Strait to enter the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross, a structure within the Catholic Church for former Anglicans. A former priest of the Church of the Torres Strait was ordained as a transitional deacon in June 2018 by James Foley, Bishop of Cairns.

From Delhi the expressway goes to Nakodar in Jalandhar district where it Y-forks into two separate spurs, one of which goes west to Amritsar and another northwest to Katra. This Expressway will reduce the current Delhi-Katra distance from 727 km to 588 km or from 14 hours to 8 hours and Delhi-Amritsar distance to 405 km or from 8 hours to 4 hours. It will have trauma centre, ambulance, fire brigade, traffic police, bus bays, truck stops, interchanges with refreshment and recreational facilities. To be constructed as part of the Bharatmala project, it is expected to cost Rs 35,000 crore. Detailed Project Report (DPR) was completed in November 2019, and land acquisition commenced from January 2020. M/s Feedback Infra was appointed as DPR consultants to carryout alignment studies which submitted final shortest proposed alignment report of Delhi-Gurdaspur section in September 2019 , Nakodar-Amritsar section in June 2020 and survey under progress on Jammu section. Project details It is combination of greenfield and brownfield expressway which passes through Haryana, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. It starts from Kundli Manesar Palwal Expressway (KMP) near village Jasur Kheri in Jhajjar District. It will lessen the workload of Grand Trunk Road. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways of the NDA government planned to construct 10 expressways in the country under Bharatmala pariyojana, one of which would connect the national capital Delhi with Katra and Amritsar via Kharkhoda, Jind, Sangrur, Ludhiana , Jalandhar, Gurdaspur. The Greenfield expressway splits into two near Nakodar. One greenfield section towards Amritsar would pass nearby Sultanpur Lodhi, Goindwal Sahib, Khadoor Sahib, TarnTarn and ends near Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport . Second section goes straight to Katra bypassing Kathua and Jammu and it consists of both greenfield and brownfield part. Central and state governments also agreed to connect Dera Baba Nanak and Kartarpur Corridor with this expressway project. Nearly 14000 acres of fertile Land of Punjab and 5000 acres of Haryana will be acquired for construction of this expressway.

League membership There were several changes to the league's membership and alignments between the 2017 and 2018 seasons, with North Melbourne reserves joining the competition, Frankston rejoining, and North Ballarat departing, resulting in a total membership of 15. The Frankston Football Club returned to the competition after a one-year hiatus. AFL Victoria had terminated the club's licence at the end of the 2016 season due to its unviable financial position, which saw it in administration owing more than $1,500,000.

The club then applied for and was re-granted its VFL licence for the 2018 season. At the end of 2017, the ten-year reserves affiliation between the AFL's North Melbourne Football Club and the VFL's Werribee Football Club came to an end. North Melbourne entered its reserves team in the VFL seniors, the first time that team had competed in the competition. Werribee continued to field a stand-alone senior team in the VFL.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/teams/north-melbourne/north- melbourne-to-field-standalone-vfl-team-in-2018-after-parting-ways-with- werribee/news-story/8cbc653bd3977b87931d68f21496b64f North Melbourne to field standalone VFL team in 2018 after parting ways with Werribee The teams continued to share a home ground, with all Werribee home games and most North Melbourne home games played at the newly upgraded Avalon Airport Oval in Werribee until North Melbourne's traditional home at Arden Street Oval was brought to VFL standard in mid-2019. After the 2017 home-and-away season had concluded, AFL Victoria suspended North Ballarat's playing licence. The club had endured two years of off-field instability since the termination of its partial reserves affiliation with AFL club . This had included: multiple changes of personnel at executive and board level; the compulsory acquisition of its home ground Eureka Stadium in early 2017; and difficulties in governance associated with the club's attentions being divided between its VFL team and the North Ballarat City team it operated in the Ballarat Football League. AFL Victoria determined that the club's governance had deteriorated to the point that it no longer met the minimum requirements for a VFL licence. The club's poor on-field performances ‚Äì a combined win-loss record in 2016 and 2017 of 4‚Äì32 ‚Äì was also a factor. The suspension brought to an end North Ballarat's 22-year association with the VFL, which included three premierships. AFL Victoria maintains an interest in maintaining an ongoing VFL presence in Ballarat, and as of February 2019 there were ongoing discussions between AFL Victoria and club's board on a model for re-entry of the club as a new or rebranded Ballarat team in the competition, but no agreement has been reached. Another significant change to the VFL's structure prior to 2018 was the abolition of the Development League competition, ending 90 years of VFA/VFL seconds/reserve grade football dating back to the 1920s. Under the new arrangement, VFL-listed players from all clubs will play for local affiliated suburban competitions when not playing senior football for their club ‚Äì the structure which was already in place for the clubs with no Development League team. The decision was made for a number of reasons, including rising costs, difficulties with scheduling, shortages of manpower within the clubs, and to improve relationships with suburban football. The clubs fielding Development League teams generally opposed the change, concerned that the pathway between suburban or under-18s football and the VFL would be affected. In particular, the clubs involved in affiliations with AFL clubs, where most of the senior players on any given week are AFL-listed reserves players, were concerned that they would be reduced to having almost no players of their own, reducing their identity or utility as football clubs. Ladder Finals Qualifying and Elimination Finals Semi Finals Preliminary Finals Grand Final Awards * The J. J. Liston Trophy was won jointly by Michael Gibbons (Williamstown) and Anthony Miles (Richmond reserves), who each polled 19 votes. It was Gibbons' second Liston Trophy, having also won the award in 2016. Gibbons and Miles finished ahead of Sam Collins (Werribee) and Alex Woodward (Collingwood reserves), who finished equal-third on 16 votes apiece. * The Frosty Miller Medal was won by Nick Larkey (North Melbourne reserves), who kicked 41 goals during the home-and-away season. * The Fothergill-Round- Mitchell Medal was won by Josh Corbett (Werribee). *The VFL Women's premiership was won by Hawthorn. Hawthorn 4.6 (30) defeated Geelong 2.5 (17) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the men's Grand Final on 23 September at Marvel Stadium. Notable events * During the season, a provisional license was granted to AFL Tasmania to allow for the return of a Tasmanian team to the VFL commencing in 2021. Tasmania had not been represented in the VFL since the departure of the Tasmanian Devils Football Club at the end of 2008. * In Round 11, Sandringham 0.9 (9) lost to Williamstown 11.11 (77) in a game at Williamstown affected by torrential rain and sheets of stagnant water on the ground. It was the lowest score in Sandringham's history, and the first time a team had been held goalless in a VFA/VFL match since Northcote in 1919. Eight of Williamstown's eleven goals came in the final quarter. Three rounds later, the North Melbourne reserves 0.7 (7) were also held goalless in rain-affected match, losing to Casey 5.14 (44), for the lowest score in its brief VFL history. *In Round 14, Coburg 12.7 (79) drew Sandringham 11.13 (79), in a match that ended in unusual circumstances. Sandringham forward Doulton Langlands had been awarded a free kick from 45 metres out just as the siren sounded, and his initial kick failed to make the distance. However, umpire Andrew Mitchell awarded a 50-metre penalty as one of the Coburg trainers ran through the mark as Langlands was taking his kick. The resulting penalty meant that Langlands retook his shot from the goal square, from which he kicked the goal and denied Coburg its first win for the season. *In three late season matches (Coburg vs Werribee in Round 18, Northern vs Coburg in Round 19, and Northern vs Sandringhamin Round 20), AFL Victoria trialled two rule changes it was considering for introduction nationally: the \\"6‚Äì6‚Äì6 rule\\", requiring six players from each team to be standing inside each 50m arc at a centre bound; and the extension of the goal square from 9m to 18m. The 6‚Äì6‚Äì6 rule was adopted in 2019, while the extended goal square was not. *In the Qualifying Final between Richmond and Williamstown, the floodlights at Swinburne Centre went out due to overheating globes with around five minutes remaining in the third quarter. The match was delayed for twenty minutes, with three-quarter time taken immediately and the remaining five minutes added to the playing time in the final quarter. * The Fothergill-Round Medal, awarded to the most promising player younger than 23, was renamed the Fothergill-Round-Mitchell Medal from this season onwards. The medal was originally named in honour of Williamstown's Des Fothergill and Barry Round, who had each won a J. J. Liston Trophy (or its predecessor) as well as the VFL/AFL's Brownlow Medal; so the name of Box Hill's Sam Mitchell, who had achieved the same feat in the years since the award was created, was added. VFL Women's League membership The VFL Women's competition, now in this third season since coming under the VFL brand, also underwent a significant change for the 2018 season, with a view towards aligning the competition more directly with the AFL Women's national competition, and with Victoria-based AFL clubs taking more direct roles in state level women's football development, either through fielding their own teams or by affiliating with existing clubs. This in turn meant a step away from the traditional Victorian Women's Football League clubs which had formed the core of the VFLW in its first two seasons. New licenses were granted to four AFL clubs ‚Äì , , , ‚Äì who all fielded club-branded women's teams in the competition. A fifth AFL club, , obtained a licence transferred to it from the Seaford Tigers, and the club formed a partnership with the VFL's Frankston to form a women's team called the Southern Saints. A sixth club, , obtained a licence from the Knox Falcons, transferred it to its senior VFL-affiliate Box Hill, then rebranded it to Hawthorn's brand. The VU Western Spurs, who were already affiliated with the AFL's Western Bulldogs, remained a separate entity but began co-branding with their AFL affiliate, becoming known as the Western Bulldogs and wearing the same colours from 2018. Two VFL clubs newly obtained licences for VFLW teams: Williamstown, which was granted a new licence, and the Casey Demons, to whom the Cranbourne Eagles licence was transferred. A licence was granted to the Northern Territory Football Club, which plays senior men's football in the North East Australian Football League, creating an interstate presence in the competition. Foundation clubs Diamond Creek, Eastern Devils and St Kilda Sharks all departed the revamped competition. Under the revamp, the thirteen clubs in the VFL Women's competition ‚Äì and their affiliates ‚Äì are: *Carlton ‚Äì operated by the AFL club *Casey ‚Äì operated by the VFL club, and affiliated with AFL club *Collingwood ‚Äì operated by the AFL club *Darebin ‚Äì independent women's club, not affiliated with an AFL club *Essendon ‚Äì operated by the AFL club *Geelong ‚Äì operated by the AFL club *Hawthorn ‚Äì operated by the AFL club *Melbourne University ‚Äì independent women's club, affiliated with AFL club *Northern Territory ‚Äì operated by the NEAFL club, not affiliated with an AFL club *Richmond ‚Äì operated by the AFL club *Southern Saints ‚Äì operated by AFL club in partnership with VFL club Frankston *Western Bulldogs ‚Äì independent women's club (formerly VU Western Spurs), affiliated and co-branded with AFL club Western Bulldogs *Williamstown ‚Äì operated by the VFL club, not affiliated with an AFL club Ladder  See also  * List of VFA/VFL premiers * Australian rules football * Victorian Football League * Australian Football League * 2018 AFL season References Victorian Football League seasons VFL ","title":"2018 VFL season"},{"id":"55415026","text":"The 5th Squadron () was a squadron of the 4th Air Wing of the Japan Air Self- Defense Force based at Matsushima Air Base, in Iwate Prefecture, Japan.

It is found in the central valley in Oaxaca State, Mexico. Description Tliltocatl schroederi is of medium size for the genus; males have a total body length of around 34‚Äì36 mm, females being significantly larger at around 48 mm. The fourth leg is longest, without the coxa measuring about 61 mm in males and 47 mm in females. The overall colour is dark brown to black, without the quantity of red hairs on the border of the carapace, abdomen and legs typical of many related species. The trochanters and femora of the first pair of legs have plumose hairs. The first and second pairs of legs of the male lack spines. The eggs are fewer in number and larger than in most former Brachypelma species, producing larger and faster maturing young. Taxonomy Tliltocatl schroederi was first described by Jan-Peter Rudloff in 2003, as Brachypelma schroederi. The specific name refers to Steffen Schr√∂der, a spider enthusiast, who bred T. schroederi, and provided Rudloff with both observations and specimens. In November 2019, it was proposed that it be moved to the new genus Tliltocatl; this has been accepted by the World Spider Catalog. Distribution Tliltocatl schroederi was described from specimens said to have been collected from the area around Acapulco in Mexico. However, this appears to be based on incorrect information from the dealer who supplied the specimens, and the actual distribution is Valles Centrales de Oaxaca, Oaxaca State, Mexico. Conservation All species of Brachypelma, then including Tliltocatl, were placed on CITES Appendix II in 1994, thus restricting trade.

Dong was born in 1914 in the Keqiao district of Shaoxing prefecture in Zhejiang, China. He graduated from Huilan High School in Hangzhou. In 1932, he was admitted to study civil engineering at Zhejiang University. In 1933 and 1934 he attended the Suzhou Art Institute and the Hangzhou National Art Institute. After graduating from the latter in 1939, he attended the Paris Art Institute at Hanoi, Vietnam for half a year. Between 1942 and 1946, he worked as a researcher at the Dunhuang Art Research Institute, copying wall paintings. In 1946 he began to teach at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beiping. During this time, he sympathized with the student political activities of the Chinese Communist Party, and participated in activities leading to the takeover of Beiping. In July 1949, he participated in painting the first portrait of Mao Zedong at Tiananmen. In December of the same year, the jointed the Communist Party. Between 1952 and 1953, he painted his best-known work, The Founding Ceremony of the Nation. Dong was a professor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. He led the drafting of the relief sculptures for the Monument to the People's Heroes. He was also a member of the second Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In 1962 he set up a studio in the Academy with Wu Zuoren and Luo Gongliu. In 1969, he was politically persecuted and made to perform labor. He died of cancer on 8 January 1973. Dong was an expert in portraiture. His oil paintings combined Western techniques of realism from the Renaissance with the ornamental tastes of Chinese traditional painting, including the bright colors of the Dunhuang wall paintings, in keeping with popular tastes. His work after 1949 was affected by political trends in art. The Founding Ceremony of the Nation not only became a source for the later \\"Red Light\\" movement during the Cultural Revolution, but was twice amended by Dong after internal conflicts within the Communist Party to remove the figures of Gao Gang and Liu Shaoqi. In 1972, his student Jin Shangyi removed the figure of Lin Boqu from a copy of the painting. In 1979, another replica was made that reproduced the original condition of the painting.

Whilst the government and non-government community in Catalonia defended the vote, most of the international community either defended Spain's \\"territorial integrity\\" or simply criticised the central police's overhanded response. Other sub- national entities also supported Catalonia.  Domestic   Catalonia  Catalonian President Carles Puigdemont said he will keep his pledge to declare independence unilaterally. He added that Catalonia \\"has won the right to become an independent state.\\" He further blamed the situation in Catalonia on the \\"intransigence, the repression, the complete denial of reality, the hostility seen during the democratic demands made by our country\\" and that \\"on this day of hope and suffering, Catalonia's citizens have earned the right to have an independent state in the form of a republic ... We have earned the right to be listened to, respected and recognised.\\" Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau called on Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to resign, She told TV3 that \\"Rajoy has been a coward, hiding behind the prosecutors and courts. Today he crossed all the red lines with the police actions against normal people, old people, families who were defending their fundamental rights. It seems obvious to me that Mariano Rajoy should resign.\\" She added that Catalonia has \\"earned the right to demand\\" a proper vote on independence from Spain: \\"the European Union must take a stand on what has happened in Catalonia\\". MEP from Catalonia Jordi Sol√© i Ferrando said: \\"The European Union so far is making a huge mistake, because we are not mainly talking right now on whether Catalonia has the right to become an independent state or not. It is up to the Catalans to decide. But we are talking about basic fundamental democratic rights being attacked in the European Union, in 2017. We Catalans are citizens of the European Union. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union also applies in our country, so the European Union and European institutions should be concerned about what has been going on in Catalonia in recent days. They shouldn't be only talking about law and constitution, about the rule of law, they should start talking about fundamental democratic rights.\\" Jordi Sanchez, leader of the ANC, spoke in Barcelona's main square saying he hopes that \\"very soon we will see the birth of a new Catalan state.\\" He also warned local leaders: \\"Now, don't let us down ... The moment of truth has arrived.\\" Government Spokesman Jordi Turull said that Spain is \\"the shame of Europe\\" for its crackdown. He added that \\"what the police are doing is simply savage, it's an international scandal\\". The CCOO union called for a general strike on 3 October \\"to condemn the violence employed by security forces of the state to stop the referendum\\". It also called for protests on 2 October at 12:00 in front of town halls across Catalonia. Jordi Cuixart, the leader of Omnium, also urged a general strike in Catalonia on 3 October. Demonstration on 8 October 2017 On 8 October 2017, Societat Civil Catalana gathered over a million people according to the organizers and the Spanish government and 350,000 people according to Barcelona police, in a rally against Catalan independence. To date this event was the largest pro-Constitution and anti- independence demonstration in the history of Catalonia. On 12 October 2017, 65,000 people, according to the Barcelona local police, marched against independence in a smaller demonstration marking the Spanish national day. The turnout was thirteen times more than the prior year and the highest on record in Barcelona's history for this event. On 29 October 2017, hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated on the streets of Barcelona in favor of the unity of Spain and celebrating the Spanish government forcing new regional elections in December, in a demonstration called by Societat Civil Catalana. According to the Delegation of the Spanish government in Catalonia the turnout was of 1,000,000 people whereas according to the Barcelona police it was of 300,000 people. Societat Civil Catalana itself estimated the turnout at 1,000,000 people.  Central government  In a televised statement, King Felipe VI said the referendum's organisers had jeopardised national stability \\"with their decisions, they have systematically undermined the rules approved legally and legitimately, showing an unacceptable disloyalty towards the powers of the state‚Äîa state that represents Catalan interests.\\" Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy claimed that no referendum had been held. He also praised the police for acting with \\"firmness and serenity.\\" Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said the police actions were \\"unfortunate\\" and \\"unpleasant\\" but \\"proportionate.\\" He told the Associated Press, that he blamed the violence exclusively on Puigdemont and his regional government: \\"if people insist in disregarding the law and doing something that has been consistently declared illegal and unconstitutional, law enforcement officers need to uphold the law.\\" In regards to the constitution MP Rafael Hernando said: \\"The [Article] 155 needs wide-ranging backing because we don't know whether it will resolve problems, and if it's only backed by one party in congress then it will be difficult to obtain the backing of a majority of Catalans.\\" PSOE's General Secretary Pedro S√°nchez said that the vote \\"has perverted the concept of democracy\\" and urged central government to begin negotiations with the regional Catalan leaders. He also blamed the \\"serious institutional crisis\\" on both the central government and the regional Catalan government. He further condemned Rajoy's cabinet for ordering the police charges against voters to halt the suspended referendum, but added that he would stand by Rajoy in order to support the stability of Spain in a moment of deep crisis. He then added that the vote \\"consecrates the Catalan government's flight forward, creating solely division and not providing any solution.\\"  Economy  The following day the Madrid-based Ibex fell by over one percent, despite regional and global markets rising. The Euro also fell. On 4 October, after announcing its relocation to Madrid, Catalan enterprise Oryzon rose over a 20% in the Madrid Stock Exchange. One day later, Banco Sabadell agreed to move their headquarters to Alicante. In successive days, La Caixa moved to Valencia and other enterprises left Catalonia, many of them helped by a decree of the Spanish government for easing the relocation of their registration. As of 10 October, 28 enterprises, including six of the seven Catalan enterprises that make up the index, left the region and six more companies reported it would do so if the independence of Catalonia is declared by a Unilateral declaration of independence. As of 18 October, this number increased to 805, including companies like Codorn√≠u Winery, established in 1551, which moved to La Rioja, or the airline Volotea, that relocated their headquarters in Asturias.  Sport  FC Barcelona played their weekend La Liga match against Las Palmas behind closed doors, partially due to safety purposes, as well as in protest. During Spain national football team's training session on 2 October 2017, Piqu√© was the target of insults by many Spanish fans, due to his comments after Barcelona's 3‚Äì0 win over Las Palmas. The session had to be ended after just 23 minutes due to this. Barcelona captain Andr√©s Iniesta urged dialogue to resolve the situation. He wrote on Facebook: \\"I have never before publicly commented on situations that are so complex and involve such diverse emotions, but this situation we are experiencing is exceptional, one thing I know for sure: before we do any more harm, those who are responsible for all this must hold dialogue. Do it for all of us. We deserve to live in peace\\".  International   Supranational bodies  * - Vice-President Roger Gale of the Parliamentary Assembly declared said: \\"It is with deep regret that I have seen the incidents of violence that have occurred in Catalonia today. I call on all sides to exercise restraint and self-discipline and to work to restore calm and reestablish dialogue.\\" **Venice Commission ‚Äì The Commission said the vote \\"does not meet\\" the commission's standards for a fair referendum, as it is not recognised by the Spanish government or its constitution. Secretary General Thomas Markert did make the point of referencing the 2014 Scottish referendum, highlighting it as an example of a fair, legally-approved vote as it gained the support of the U.K. government. *Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) ‚Äì The OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) told TASS on 2 October that it would not comment on the vote because it had no observers present. Earlier, the OSCE office's director called on Spanish authorities to \\"ensure that police use force only when necessary and in strict adherence to the principle of proportionality.\\" * - Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres \\"trusts that the democratic institutions of Spain will find a solution\\" to the crisis between Catalan separatists and the national government.\\" **High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein voiced concern at the violence in saying police responses needed to be \\"at all times ...proportionate and necessary. I firmly believe that the current situation should be resolved through political dialogue, with full respect for democratic freedoms.\\"https://www.reuters.co.uk/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1C71CN **On March 7, 2018 the High Commissioner for Human Rights said \\"I was dismayed by the violence which broke out during October's referendum on independence in Catalonia. Given what appeared to be excessive use of force by police, the Government's characterization of police action on 1 October as \\"legal, legitimate and necessary\\" is questionable\\". = European Union = The European Commission suggested that the Catalan independence referendum was \\"not legal\\" under Spanish law. It described the vote as an \\"internal matter\\" and suggested it would not heed calls to intervene. A spokesperson Margaritis Schinas said: \\"This is an internal matter for Spain that has to be dealt with in line with the constitutional order of Spain.\\" It issued a statement that read: \\"We call on all relevant players to now move very swiftly from confrontation to dialogue. Violence can never be an instrument in politics. We trust the leadership of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to manage this difficult process in full respect of the Spanish Constitution and of the fundamental rights of citizens enshrined therein. Beyond purely legal aspects, the Commission believes that these are times for unity and stability, not divisiveness and fragmentation.\\" President Donald Tusk later announced on Twitter that he had spoken with Rajoy and had called for a bid to find ways \\"to avoid further escalation and use of force.\\" President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani confirmed a debate. He wrote on Twitter: \\"I spoke to Mariano Rajoy. The European Parliament will debate on constitution, rule of law and fundamental rights in Spain in light of the events in Catalonia.\\". The Vice President of the European parliament Ram√≥n Luis Valc√°rcel meanwhile described the referendum as \\"a coup against Europe\\" in a statement that read: \\"Today we have witnessed a nationalistic propaganda act, undemocratic; a coup attempt against Spanish democracy, and so a coup against Europe. We are witnessing the first coup against democracy in the history of the European Union. A regional government is angling, in a unilateral, illegal and democratically deplorable manner, to secede from a member state. And in so doing, it is violating the fundamental rights of millions of citizens. Spain is an integral part of the EU, which respects and safeguards the national identities and constitutional structure of its member states. An attack on the constitution of one member state is therefore also an attack on the Union as a whole.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/30/spanish- ambassador-to-uk-calls-catalan-referendum-a-coup-detat The coup d'etat claim was also shared by both Spanish MEP Carlos Iturgaiz and Ambassador to the UK Carlos Bastarreche. European Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans told the European Parliament: \\"It is a duty for any government to uphold the rule of law, and this sometimes requires the proportionate use of force. Respect for the rule of law is not optional; it's fundamental.\\" The Budget Commissioner Gunther Oettinger said \\"that the situation is very, very disturbing. A civil war is planned in the middle of Europe. One can only hope that a conversation will be made between Madrid and Barcelona soon.\\" He added that the EU could only mediate talks \\"if asked.\\"  MEPs  Spokesman for the European People's Party which is the largest group inside the European Parliament, said: \\"Someone needs to tell the Catalan people the truth. If you contest the law to abandon Spain you also need to know that you abandon the EU.\\" *The Leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group and Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt, who leads the EU-Brexit negotiations, called for de-escalation and a negotiated solution to the conflict. \\"In the European Union we try to find solutions through political dialogue and with respect for the constitutional order.\\"https://www.amp.co.uk/amp/amp.dw.com/en/catalonia- referendum-violence-prompts-european-reaction/a-40772750 *The Chair of Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy and British MEP Nigel Farage expressed his opinion in the European parliament in saying: \\"Whether or not it was legal nationally for people in Catalonia to have a vote, surely people are allowed to express an opinion. We saw women being dragged out of polling stations by their hair, old ladies with gashes in their forehead. The most extraordinary display and what do we get from Mr. Juncker today? Not a dickie-bird. In fact previously we had that the rule of law must be maintained and I think it is quite extraordinary to realise that this union is prepared to turn a blind eye.\\" *German and Vice President of the Greens‚ÄìEuropean Free Alliance MEP Ska Keller said that \\"the Commission could act as an \\"honest broker\\" to promote compromise. \\"It is wrong if the Commission shies away and continues to turn a blind eye.\\" *Estonian MEP Urmas Paet issued a statement that read: \\"I would expect a clear stance from Estonia as the EU presidency concerning yesterday's police violence in Catalonia. In fact, I would have expected it yesterday already. Yet both the prime minister and the foreign minister remain silent. Why [is] the role of [the] EU presidency for Estonia if we are trying to avoid a stance on a matter so important? The position of [the] EU presidency entails responsibility in addition to honor.\\" *Czech MEP Pavel Svoboda said the actions of the Spanish government were deplorable and would only make more people embrace the separatist cause. *Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and Crezh MEP Kate≈ôina Koneƒçn√° pointed out that the violence accompanying the referendum was likely to fuel opposition to the Spanish government and anger extremists, as well as normal citizens who may previously not have had a strong opinion on the matter, producing a strong backlash and the exact opposite of what the government intended. She said the Spanish government should look to the UK and the Scottish independence referendum for a lesson on how such things should best be handled. *German MEP Manfred Weber said: \\"If Catalonia leaves Spain that also means 'leaving the European Union.'\\" *Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP who co-leads the Greens group in the European Parliament, warns that events in Catalonia \\"threaten the spirit of European integration, even more than Brexit.\\" *Irish MEP Matt Carthy said: \\"Unless EU leaders match their responses to what happened in Catalonia with their statements, they will be forever seen as hypocrites when trying to install democratic values in foreign countries.\\"  Countries  * - The Spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry Hikmat Hajiyev said: \\"The Republic of Azerbaijan respects the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Kingdom of Spain within its internationally recognised borders.

In a televised statement, Maduro said \\"our hand goes out to the people of Catalonia. Resist, Catalonia! Latin America admires you\\".  Business  Moody's Investors Service has warned that the increased tensions over Catalonia's push for independence could hurt the country's overall debt worthiness. The agency said the \\"ratcheting-up of tensions has negative credit implications\\" that could be worsened if Catalonia's regional government declares independence after claiming victory in the referendum. It added that the probability of Catalan independence remains low, mainly because it remains unclear that a majority of Catalans actually want independence. It expects the sides to negotiate a deal for greater powers for the region. The agency further noted that Catalonia represents about a fifth of Spain's economy, with a high per capita GDP, so independence could seriously affect Spain's public finances. Fitch Ratings announced that it would place Catalonia on \\"rating watch negative\\" (RWN) over uncertainties over the region's debt obligations. The rating agency explained that the stand-off with Spanish authorities and the possibility of Catalonia's independence \\"may lead to unforeseeable events, including a potential disruption of the state liquidity funds to Catalonia.\\" It said however that this was not its \\"base case scenario\\" and that it expected that \\"current tensions will ease\\" and allow it to \\"resolve the RWN within the next six months\\". Another rating agency, S&P;, also placed Catalonia on \\"CreditWatch with negative implications\\". It said that the \\"escalation\\" between Barcelona and Madrid \\"may damage the coordination and communication between the two governments, which is essential to Catalonia's ability to service its debt on time and in full.\\" However it said it expected to \\"resolve the CreditWatch within the next three months.\\" Charles St-Arnaud, an investment strategist at Lombard Odier Asset Management, said: \\"The answer of politicians is key. The separatist movement has avoided calling independence, so that's putting the market in a wait-and-see mode.\\" Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: \\"The resolve of regional officials in Catalonia to announce independence from Spain has caught markets off guard.\\" President of the British Chamber of Commerce in Spain Christopher Dottie said that U.K. companies were monitoring events closely because they did not want to embark on new projects without knowing what the future held. They were aware that any separation implied costs and they would opt for whichever involved the least impact.  Media  The Guardian wrote: The Guardian also added, on October the 20th the article \\"The Catalan case is persuasive. But that way lies ruin (Natalie Nougayr√®de), who stated \\"...the 1 October referendum was hardly a model of sound, democratic expression. Only a minority of Catalans took part (turnout was 43%), and its organisation ran counter to Catalonia's own legislation. The two laws that led to it were voted through without the two-thirds majority the Catalan charter (the Estatut) requires for such a momentous reform process. Nor was the vote overseen by the regional constitutional court. The Council of Europe, Europe's democracy watchdog, said it did not abide by its fundamental criteria. Reporters without Borders, an organisation that scrutinises freedom of the press, denounced the harassment and intimidation ‚Äì sometimes physical ‚Äì of reporters who did not toe the pro-independence line. These points often get drowned out in the romantic wave of commentary that Catalonia and its history can understandably inspire, within and beyond Spain. Catalan radicals have taken to social media to try to raise support across Europe, using English-language videos.\\" BBC Diplomatic Correspondent James Landale asked: \\"How could an EU that opposed independence for, say, the Kurds or Crimea suddenly decide to welcome it for the Catalans? The EU would find it hard to back a vote for self-determination that had been so clearly ruled illegal by a country's constitutional court.\\" Deutsche Welle drew parallels between Catalonia and European separatist movements in the Basque country, Scotland, Flanders, Padania, South Tyrol, and Corsica. The New York Times criticised both Rajoy and Puigdemont for their belligerency. It added \\"[I]n European sovereignty, not in more national flags, lies the bright future of every European of good will.\\" CNN mentioned the violence as \\"terrifying, but it can and should be a lesson for the world about the importance of upholding the spirit of democracy and the protection of human rights.\\" It concluded: \\"But the United Nations at large can do more. Through official means, it should send a message to any actors who instigate, dictate, justify and/or perpetrate violations of fundamental rights. It should also advise that all concerned parties put human rights, accountability and the protection of civilians at the center of political negotiations and peace processes. Let's hope our institutions -- national, regional and global -- pass the test of protecting democratic values in Catalonia.\\" The Africa Confidential wrote: \\"Religion, poverty and oil exacerbate ethnic and tribal divisions in Nigeria, which is why people in its southern region once known as the self-declared Republic of Biafra have a keen eye on Catalonian secessionists.\\" It added that \\"...There is a nightmare scenario under which south-east secessionists link up with Niger Delta militants and try to stall the economy. Some officials speculate about the risks of militants from the Delta and the south-east teaming up with campaigners from Anglophone south- west Cameroon who are demanding an independent state, known as Ambazonia.\\"  Individuals  Walter Schwimmer, former Secretary General of the Council of Europe told RT: \\"It calls urgently for dialogue, there's no alternative. I have been shocked by the force used by the police. I fully understand that the Spanish government wants to defend the territorial integrity of the country. On the other side, there are justified requests by the people of Catalonia that cannot be answered just by police force. That calls for dialogue and I hope Europe will be able to moderate such a dialogue between the Spanish central government and the government of Catalonia.\\" On 2 September, following violent police clashes, co-founder of Wikipedia Jimmy Wales wrote on Twitter: \\"Without any reservations I condemn the violence against peaceful voters in the Catalan referendum.\\" British columnist Katie Hopkins told the Express that Catalonia's public uproar could happen in the U.K. because those supporting \\"Brexit are not being listened to. Watching Catalonia unfurl was absolutely bonkers. The Spanish government were saying no, there's no such thing as this referendum. The referendum happened. The scenes of violence towards people peacefully trying to cast a vote. They weren't armed, they weren't protesting. They were just peacefully trying to cast their vote, whether that was illegal or not.\\" Dr Marina Bock, a lecturer in civil engineering at the University of Wolverhampton who was born in Barcelona and studied at the city's Polytechnic University of Catalonia, said: \\"I was born in the city of Barcelona in Catalonia where I spent almost 30 years of my life before moving to the U.K. a few years ago. My feelings are hard to describe but I would say they are a combination of sadness and anger. I don't consider myself a strong Catalan nationalist but would strongly defend my language, culture, traditions and people which the Spanish government seems not to have been respecting as they should, especially since Mariano Rajoy['s] party came back into [the] government in 2011 with an unduly anti-Catalanism approach. For instance, imposing Spanish as a main language in schools as they believe Catalans are able to speak Catalan only. As a person educated in Barcelona, I absolutely have no problems communicating in both Spanish and Catalan. Neither do most of the educated Catalan population.\\" Aleksei Martynov, a Russian political commentator, argued in an opinion piece for Izvestia that the EU was rattled by the Brexit referendum and was now using \\"all possible means\\" to hold the bloc together. \\"Emerging from the stupor of animal fear, the Euro-bureaucrats have cursed the very word 'referendum' and today are ready, having transcended their own rhetorical principles, to repressively defend the European Union in its current form through all possible means, but by the hands of national governments, today's events in Spanish Catalonia in any case mark the end of European political romanticism.

This article is on Japanese army and diplomatic ciphers and codes used up to and during World War II, to supplement the article on Japanese naval codes. The diplomatic codes were significant militarily, particularly those from diplomats in Germany. Japanese army (IJA) and diplomatic codes were studied at Arlington Hall (US), Bletchley Park (UK), Central Bureau or CBB (Australian, US; in Melbourne, then Brisbane), the FECB (British Far East Combined Bureau) at Hong Kong, Singapore, Kilindi then Colombo and the British Wireless Experimental Centre in Delhi.  Japanese Army codes and ciphers  Initially Arlington Hall had delayed study of the Army codes until 1942 because of the \\"high payoff\\" from diplomatic codes, but were not successful until 1943. Then with success on Army codes in April the increasing workload was put under Solomon Kullback in branch B-II in September. Other mainly diplomatic work was put under Frank Rowlett in B-III. Branch B-I translated Japanese. Initially ‚Äúbrute-force‚Äù IBM runs on Army codes from April 1942 to the end of the year did not work. But US Army Sgt Joe Richard noticed that the system for 2468 changed every three weeks, so the messages could be arranged by IBM tabulators by group and time period. Richard was assisted at Central Bureau by Major Harry Clark and by the head Abe Sinkov, and broke 2468 on 6 April 1943; for which he was awarded the Legion of Merit. Wilfrid Noyce at the Wireless Experimental Centre had realised that the first letter of the third group of each message was not random, and that other groups were paired in \\"doublets\\". Initially Arlington Hall could not find the non-randomness until Richard told them it changed about every four weeks. So with the tip Arlington Hall broke the code, as did the Wireless Experimental Centre. It used a 10 x 10 conversion square with the plain text digits 0-9 across the top key digits down the side and the table contained the cipher text digits. As well as \\"kana\\" the Chinese Telegraph Code was used to explain places or words, and the code groups 1951 or 5734 indicated that the CTC follows; an \\"absurd security flaw\\" as it was like \\"Stop\\" as a key. The CTC code group was often preceded by the \\"kana\\" groups for the same character.  Main Army codes  Many of the Army codes were known to the Allies by their four-figure discriminant numbers. The SIS at Arlington Hall gave them three- letter codes e.g. JEM. A conference at Arlington Hall in early 1944 decided on the allocation of high-level army codes. * 2345 Army Ordnance System or JEN * 2468 Water Transport Code senpaku angoshu 2 a super-enciphered code or JEK * 3366 Army Air Force General Purpose Code * 3636 Air Safety Service Code koku hoan angoo-sho No 1 * 5555 North Pacific System * 5678 or ATRW the main Army system to early (May) 1942, then split into 2345 and 7890 * 6633 Army Air General Purpose Code, Burma (variant of 3366) * 6666 Philippine System, old; used by cut-off units in 1944 * 7777 South-West Pacific System * 7890 Army General Administrative System or JEM * BULBUL an Army air-to-ground reciphered code kuuchi renraku kanji-hyoo 2-goo.  Water Transport Code  The Army Water Transport Code senpaku angoshu 2 (2468 or JEK) was used by the Water Transport organization (the Army‚Äôs own Navy) when moving troops around the Pacific. Ships signalled their noontime position, course, speed and other movement items. As the Japanese relied extensively on sea transport for isolated garrisons, the information assisted in planning air raids and action against Japanese air raids, and (through the American Seventh Fleet) submarine attacks. Breaking it in 1943 gave the Allies insight into other Army codes.  BULBUL  A three-figure reciphered air-to-ground code used by the IJA, kuuchi renraku kanji-hyoo 2-goo was known to the British as BULBUL. First broken by the Bletchley Park air section, it provided vital tactical information so was worked on in India at the Wireless Experimental Centre in Delhi. Traffic from the army operational flying units based around Meiktila in Burma was particularly valuable, aided by a book and some additive sheets from a Japanese aircraft shot down over India. By November 1944 many messages predicting air raids were intercepted, decoded and sent out as intelligence in ninety minutes. On one occasion Allied nightfighters got the lot and all night we could hear Mingaladon air base calling for its lost children.  Find of Japanese Army records In January 1944, Mainline Japanese Army codes were broken with help from a buried trunk found during the Battle of Sio in New Guinea by Australian troops of the 9th Division. The records had been left by retreating Japanese Army troops of the 20th Division (Tokyo was told the papers had been burnt, but the lieutenant did not want to reveal his position by burning them), so they were buried in a metal strongbox near a stream. They included the army codebook Rikugun Angosho Number Four (which was fed into Sinkov's IBM machines); two additive books and codes for these traffic identifiers (which were now readable): 2345, 5555, 6666, 7777 and 7870; and an instruction book on how to use the other books. The Central Bureau spent a day drying the damp pages, and the flood of decoded messages that ensued meant that MacArthur has to ask the US Navy for assistance. Two translators, Forrest Biard and Thomas Mackie were sent from FRUMEL.  Japanese diplomatic codes and ciphers  The most important diplomatic cipher used by the Foreign Office was Purple. The Japanese military (army) effectively controlled Japanese foreign policy, and told the Foreign Office little. But decrypted Purple traffic was valuable militarily, particularly reports from Nazi Germany by Japanese diplomats and military and naval attach√©s. Arlington Hall had delayed study of the Army codes until 1942 because of the \\"high payoff\\" from diplomatic codes, but were not successful with Army codes until 1943. The fourteen-part message breaking off negotiations with the United States in December 1941 on the eve of Pearl Harbour was in Purple; and was translated by the Americans in advance of the Japanese embassy staff who were preparing it for delivery. The Japanese ambassador to Nazi Germany, General Hiroshi Oshima was well-informed on German military affairs and intimate with Nazi leaders. Examples of his despatches to Japan in Purple include a report that Hitler said on June 3, 1941 that in every probability war with Russia cannot be avoided. In July and August 1942 Oshima toured the Russian front, and in 1944 he saw the Atlantic Wall fortifications against the expected Allied invasion along the coasts of France and Belgium. On 4 September 1944 Hitler said to him that Germany would strike in the West, probably in November (the \\"Battle of the Bulge\\"). He was described by General George Marshall as \\"our main basis of information regarding Hitler's intentions in Europe\\". Purple The Purple cipher was used by the Japanese Foreign Office as its most secure system. The U.S. called this the \\"Purple\\" code, because they kept intercepted traffic in purple binders. Although the Japanese purchased the Enigma machine they chose to base their cipher machine on a different technology; using a stepping switch rather than several rotors. http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/bpt/japcdsch2.html  LA Code  The LA code was a low-grade code for consular messages, and was broken by the Sydney University group of Monterey codebreakers in 1941 before they moved to FRUMEL. Athanasius Treweek said that there were several grades of diplomatic code, and they came to pieces fairly easily. The LA code was called that because every message began with the letters LA. It was child's play.  Notes   References and further reading   * , Chapter 10.

Although the event takes place in Gabon, the initial objective of this event is to present the traditional cultural richness of the different ethnic groups of the peoples of Central Africa.  Historical  The origin of the creation of the tournament of the nine provinces dates back to 2015. This independent initiative was born thanks to Yoan Mboussou, Doctor and president of the socio-cultural association Espoir Gabon, who had this idea after discovering the \\"abandoned remains\\" of the Bantu International Center of Civilizations (CICIBA), a project that never really came into being when it was supposed to promote Bantu culture around the world. There was also, according to the members of the association Gabon, a desire to revive the festival of cultures Gabon which had disappeared in recent years. The first edition of this festival took place in August 2016 in Libreville, one week before the Gabonese presidential election of 2016 which was going to plunge the country into a deep political crisis. There was a desire to strengthen social cohesion, which was beginning to show signs of tension in the face of the presidential scrutiny approach.  Edition   2016  The 2016 tournament of the nine provinces took place during the week of 13 to 20 August 2016, in Libreville, Gabon. Open to the public, its realization within the ruins of the CICIBA was done with the cooperation of the squatters association of CICIBA. The final of this first edition saw the participation of two countries: Gabon and Chad. The President of the jury was none other than the singer of the traditional group Tandima, Vyckos Ekondo. The socio-cultural group Mouvissa won the first prize, amounting to 1 000 000 FCFA. The final groups for this edition were the Akeng Alliance, Bane Batsiane, Cultural Hope, Milimba, Mivengui, Mouvissa, Mutoka culture, Ogheya and Lip Darna groups from Chad (excluding competition).  2017  The 2017 edition took place from 7 to 16 August 2017 at the Botanical Garden of Libreville.

Life   In the labour movement  Ludwig Becker was born and grew up in Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, a midsized town in the hills to the east of Stuttgart. His father was a socialist and a Goldsmith, the trade in which he, too, was apprenticed. His apprenticeship completed, he undertook a \\"Journeyman year\\" travelling the country while working at his chosen trade in order to gain hands-on experience from a variety of more experienced practitioners. That was when he came into contact with the rapidly evolving Labour movement. In 1907 he joined both the Metal Workers' Union (\\"Deutscher Metallarbeiter-Verband\\" / DMV) and the Young Socialists. In 1910, when only 18 years old, he joined the Social Democratics (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). A year later he relocated from Gm√ºnd to Berlin: here he was picked out for a study course at the SPD National Party Academy where the lecturers included Rosa Luxemburg, a formidable political philosopher and an inspiring lecturer who had already become an iconic leader of the German left. Becker was opposed to the war: between 1913 and 1918 he was nevertheless called up for military service and took part in it. From the frontline he established and maintained increasingly close links with the leftist Westmeyer wing of the party in Stuttgart. Accordingly, he was one of those deeply critical of the decision of the party leadership to implement what amounted to a parliamentary truce over funding for the war. He became a member of the Spartacus League. During the series of revolutions that erupted during 1918/1919 Becker, following his election by revolutionary comrades, participated actively as a leader in the soldiers' and workers' council/soviet movement. At the end of 1918 the Spartacus League in effect became the Communist Party of Germany. Becker remained a party activist.  Communist party politics and Communist Party (Opposition) politics  Becker continued to work as a goldsmith till 1922. In 1923 he was a delegate at the 8th Party Congress of the Communist Party. On 23 November 1923 the party was temporarily outlawed and at the start of 1924 he was arrested in connection with his political activities. On 27 September 1924 he was sentenced to a six-month jail term. However, on 24 May 1924 he had been elected to the W√ºrttemberg regional parliament (Landtag) which conferred a measure of parliamentary immunity: he was released early from jail. From July 1925 he was a [paid party official, working as Party Secretary for the party at its Stuttgart office. Politically he was by now seen as part of the party's \\"right-wing\\", although it could have been argued that as hardline Stalinists took control of the levers of power, it was the party itself that had shifted. He was re-elected as a Communist member to the W√ºrttemberg regional parliament in 1928. The increasingly uncompromising approach taken by the party in Moscow to removing from positions of influence those whose personal loyalty the leader doubted found direct echoes in the German party. Becker spoke out against the increasingly Stalinist approach of the German party leadership and the doctrine of Social fascism which branded critics from within the party as \\"fascists\\". He was one of those excluded from the German party, and in 1929 joined the so-called Communist Party (Opposition), an alternative communist party comprising people expelled by the original communist party. He continued to sit in the regional parliament (Landtag), representing the \\"Opposition\\" communist party, till 1932. Between December 1930 and 1933 he was the authorized representative (Bevollm√§chtigter) of the DMV in Schwenningen, centre of the watch and clock making business in southern Germany. He was editor of \\"Aufstieg\\" and a member of Naturfreunde, the left-wing \\"friends of nature\\" organisation.  Nazi years  The Nazi Party took power in January 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. The trades unions were outlawed, and replaced by the Government's own Labour Front (\\"Deutsche Arbeitsfront\\" / DAF) organisation. Attempts were made to win Becker over to the DAF, but he resisted these, concentrating for the most part on work in the metals industrial sector. He was arrested in 1938 or 1939, though it is not clear whether this was solely on account of his political activism before 1933 or because he was suspected of (since 1933) political or trades union activity more recently. He was taken initially to the Hohenasperg, a large hilltop fortress to the north of Stuttgart which was being used to accommodate political prisoners, before being transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where he was detained till 1945. In the camp he was active as an organiser of \\"illegal political and military activities\\". He met up with two other Communist Party (Opposition) comrades from the years before the Nazi takeover, Willi Bleicher, Eugen Ochs and Robert Siewert. They worked closely together. After the German failure to conquer the Soviet Union it became possible to contemplate a post-Nazi future. The so-called \\"Buchenwald Manifesto\\", produced in 1945, can be seen as evidence of the determination of former communist inmates and SPD inmates to work together after the war, and avoid the divisions on the political left which many believed had opened the way for the Nazi take-over during the build-up to 1933.  Years of reconstruction  War ended in May 1945 and attention turned to the urgent tasks of reconstruction. Becker returned to Schwenningen, by now part of the French occupation zone (and after May 1949 part of the German Federal Republic / West Germany). His focus was on rebuilding the Communist Party and the metal workers' trades union, relaunched in 1949 as IG Metall. For several months in 1945 he served as deputy mayor of Schwenningen - still at this point a poist filled by appointment rather than through election. In 1948 he became regional head of the union for South W√ºrttemberg- Hohenzollern. He also sat, elected as one of the five communist members, in the regional parliament (Landtag) for W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern between 1947 and 1951. In May 1951 he was excluded from the Communist Party after he failed to back a party resolution (\\"These 37\\"). (The resolution, presumably inspired from East Berlin and Moscow, had condemned trades unions in West Germany for putting themselves \\"at the service ... of American imperialism and in league with the German monopolists\\".) Between 1953 and 1959, based in Stuttgart, he served as regional chief of IG Metall in W√ºrttemberg-Baden (later Baden- W√ºrttemberg). In or before 1969 Ludwig Becker retired from his remaining duties with IG Metall. He died in Bad Cannstatt - by this time a district of Stuttgart - on 4 April 1974.

Her books were published in part in 1875. Biography Thornton was born in Kirklington, North Yorkshire. She was the younger surviving daughter of Christopher Wandesford, later Lord Deputy of Ireland, and Alice Osborne (died 1659), only daughter of Sir Hewett Osborne and Joyce Fleetwood. She was, through her mother, a first cousin of Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds, the leading English statesman of the 1670s. Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, was a distant relative of her father, who was one of his closest friends and political allies, and went with him to Ireland in 1633 on Wentworth's appointment as Lord Deputy. Wentworth treated the Wandesfords as part of his own family, and Alice grew up with his daughters in Dublin Castle. Following Wentworth's downfall in 1640 Alice's father replaced him as Lord Deputy, but died only a few months later. His family fled back to England during the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and after a long and difficult journey they returned safely to Kirklington.Osborough, W.N. \\"Wills that go missing- the quest for the lost will of Christopher Wandesford, Lord Deputy of Ireland\\"published in Reflections on Law and History Four Courts Press Dublin 2006 p.10 During the general confusion of their flight her father's will disappeared, and did not turn up again for several years, leading to years of litigation and a bitter family feud over the inheritance to his estate.Osborough pp.8-16 Alice was the main sufferer in the lawsuit: she knew that the will, which she had in her keeping for a time and read, made generous provision for her, but without possession of the original will itself she was unable to prove what exactly she was entitled to. Even when the will was eventually found some members of the family disputed its validity, causing her further hardship. Alice married William Thornton in 1651. She started her autobiography, My first Booke of my Life, on 2 February 1669 when she was 47. The book was originally written as a defense against slander.Alice Thornton, Orlando, Retrieved 2 October 2017 It contains much valuable information about her father's career, and also contains vivid sketches of her mother, her sister Katherine, and her three brothers. In August 1662 she and her husband, William, built a house in East Newton in Yorkshire, where Alice spent the remainder of her life. William died in 1668. The marriage was a happy one, and Alice always wrote of her husband with love and gratitude. He has sometimes been blamed for failing to defend his wife's interests against her family, and for leaving her in poverty at his death. However Alice in her autobiography places the blame for the dispute over her father's will firmly on her own family, and in particular on her brother Christopher junior and his father-in- law Sir John Lowther. Of her numerous children, only three, a son and two daughters, reached adult life. The elder daughter, Alice (Naly), married Thomas Comber, Dean of Durham, by whom she had six children. Naly died at a great age in 1720. Writings Alice Thornton wrote three manuscripts in which she left to her oldest daughter. She was said to have written these manuscripts as a response to rumors about the timeliness of her daughter's marriage. Naly, her eldest daughter, was married three short months after the passing of her father. Alice Thornton was ridiculed for these actions, and the only way she saw fit to answer these allegations correctly was to write about them. The first manuscript was written chronologically, she began with her childhood and worked her way through her life until she reached the death of her husband. This text answered things not only about her actions, but this also addressed her faith and the way she took care of her family and house hold. This text was largely used to the 1875 edition, The Autobiography of Mrs. Alice Thornton, of East Newton, Co. York.

Originally named Penlee Point, the vessel was designed as a maintenance ship for landing craft in the Pacific Theatre of World War II but used as an accommodation ship at Rosyth Dockyard. Renamed Girdle Ness, the ship was taken out of service in 1953 and converted for use in support of missile trials in the development of the Seaslug missile in the early 1960s. After trials of the missile were completed, Girdle Ness was placed in reserve before becoming an accommodation ship as part of the shore establishment at Rosyth. The vessel was stricken in 1970.  Description and early service  Following setbacks in the Pacific theatre of operations which led to the loss of naval bases, the Royal Navy required more depot and repair ships for the fleet to replace shore facilities.Mitchell and Sawyer, p. 39 As part of the war construction programme, the Royal Navy ordered a series of vessels based on standard mercantile designs and modified them to fit their expected roles.Lenton and Colledge, p. 341 Repair and maintenance vessels were ordered from Canadian shipyards with the escort maintenance ships intended to service smaller types of warships, and in the case of Girdle Ness, landing craft.Mitchell and Sawyer, pp. 39, 41 he ships of the class had a standard displacement of and fully loaded. They were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of .Blackman (1958), p. 79Lenton and Colledge, p. 350 The vessels were propelled by one shaft driven by a reciprocating triple expansion steam engine powered by steam from two Foster Wheeler water-tube boilers, creating . This gave the vessels a maximum speed of . Dominion Engineering Works of Montreal, Quebec provided the machinery for Girdle Ness.Mitchell and Sawyer, pp. 40‚Äì44 During the war, the vessels were armed with sixteen single-mounted 20 mm Oerlikon cannons. Girdle Ness was ordered as HMS Penlee Point (F04). She was built by the Burrard Dry Dock Co. Ltd. at their yard in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, as one of twenty- one s. These were Canadian Fort ships, similar to the US Victory ships, that had been modified for use as auxiliary ships. Penlee Point was laid down on 7 December 1944 and launched on 29 March 1945. The ship was commissioned on 5 September 1945. The hull was completed at the South Yard of the Vancouver Dry Dock Company.Mitchell and Sawyer, p. 41 On entering service she was used as an accommodation ship at Rosyth Dockyard from 1946 to 1952, being placed in reserve in 1951.  Conversion as a trials ship  A trials ship was needed to support the Seaslug missile development program. Initial tests were carried out from a shore-based launcher but there was a need to test the missile under realistic conditions, and also to gain experience of handling a large missile at sea. In February 1953 Penlee Point was moved to Devonport Dockyard, Devon, for conversion into a trials ship. The conversion began in May 1953 and was completed in 1956, and she was re-commissioned as Girdle Ness on 24 July. During her conversion the entire superstructure was removed and most of the forward part of the hull gutted to provide space for the missile launcher and its attendant magazines. When she was finally completed in her new guise she had a large, boxy bridge structure, forward of which was a triple Seaslug launcher. One of the reasons why Girdle Ness was chosen for conversion was a result of a 1950 Admiralty Ship Design Policy Committee recommendation. The committee proposed that three missile-equipped types of ship would be required by the Royal Navy: : A: Task Force Ship, capable of 30 knots, and armed with two triple Seaslug launchers : B: Ocean Convoy Escort, capable of 17 knots, and armed with two triple Seaslug launchers : C: Coastal Convoy Escort, capable of 12 knots, and armed with a triple Seaslug launchers Girdle Ness was chosen to be a prototype for the Type C: Coastal Convoy Escort, although this idea was dropped before she came into service.  Radar equipment  Seaslug's guidance was a beam riding system, with the missile following a beam projected from the launching ship. This required the installation of a large radar set, for both target acquisition, tracking and the control beam. The following equipment was installed: * Parabolic telemetry antenna * Type 901 radar * Type 960 radar * Type 983 height-finding radar * Type 982 radar  Missile trials  The firing of the first test missile from HMS Girdle Ness Launch of a Seaslug missile, circa 1961 Seaslug was first tested at RAE Aberporth, on the Welsh coast of Cardigan Bay. Aberporth already hosted the land-based launcher, the Clausen Rolling Platform (nicknamed \\"HMS Rock'n'Roll\\"). Later trials were carried out in the Mediterranean, based on Malta. Seaslug was the UK's first ship-based surface-to-air missile. It used four solid boosters, then a solid sustainer rocket. Once the boosters were dropped and the sustainer fired, four large control surfaces were used to control the missile under beam-riding guidance. Seaslug was a large missile and required mechanical handling to transfer the rounds from the magazine to the trainable launcher. The large magazine was relatively highly automated for its age. During trials, the ship was crewed by a naval crew, with the missile operators being the first naval staff under training as missile operators. The Recording Room manned by civilian members of the RN Scientific Service analysing the performance of the Seaslug. In 1959 was used for trials of replenishment at sea, transferring the two-ton complete missile rounds by highline breeches buoy.  Withdrawal  During the course of her life as a missile trials ship Girdle Ness fired 209 Seaslug missiles. When the trials ended, she returned to Devonport and was paid off on 5 December 1961. She was then reclassified as an accommodation ship, and after her return to Rosyth she was re-commissioned on 1 December 1962 and served alongside , another Beachy Head-class ship, at Donibristle as part of . HMS Girdle Ness was decommissioned in early 1970 and was scrapped in Faslane from August 1970 onwards. The ship's badge, a golden girdle as a trefoil knot on a blue field, is now held by the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.

The site was operational from 1917 to 1965 and was mainly used as a stores, maintenance and training facility. History Established in 1917, the facility was initially a Royal Flying Corps storage depot, situated on both sides of the railway line close to Kidbrooke railway station. In 1917, several large storage warehouses and offices were constructed, that stretched for alongside both sides of the line, served by sidings and an extensive gauge network.A steam engine, Kidbrooke, used on the narrow gauge system at this time is preserved on the Yaxham Light Railway in Norfolk. Another engine, P-class No.178, is preserved on the Bluebell Railway in Sussex. The RFC became the RAF on 1 January 1918. Kidbrooke was named No 1 Stores Depot in March 1920. It became No 1 Equipment Depot in February 1937 and No 1 Maintenance Unit in April 1938. It was disbanded as a stores in February 1947, though its facilities remained in use but managed from elsewhere. During the Second World War, the base was expanded to include a barrage balloon depot, providing balloons to defend London against low-flying enemy aircraft. This was also the base for the No 1 Balloon Centre and 901 Squadron (a barrage balloon squadron of the Auxiliary Air Force) and No 2 Installation Unit, responsible for constructing and repairing Chain Home radar station masts. On adjacent land to the north of the railway line, No. 141 Gliding School RAF for the Air Training Corps operated from October 1942 to December 1945, after which it transferred to RAF Gravesend and then RAF Detling in north Kent. After the war, the radar installation Unit transferred to RAF West Drayton in Middlesex. Between 1949 and 1953, the Joint Services School for Linguists taught servicemen and women with an aptitude for languages to speak Russian. In January 1954, the RAF Movements School was formed at RAF Kidbrooke, tasked to provide cargo movements and mobility training to personnel of all three Services and other Government departments. It had a staff of 47 and ran around 25 courses, ranging in length from under a week to a 17-week basic recruit course, delivered to over 1,900 personnel per annum. In January 1963, the School moved to RAF Kirton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, but was disbanded the following December. RAF Kidbrooke was also the home of No 4 MT Squadron. The squadron, manned by service and civilian personnel and equipped with a variety of vehicles including heavy trucks and Queen Mary low loaders, was responsible for the movement of equipment mainly in the south of England. It also provided vehicles such as the Scammel Scarab in the London Docks. All RAF personnel were posted away in 1967 when the squadron civilianised. When RAF Kidbrooke closed in around 1968/69, the civilian staff and vehicles were relocated to Woolwich Arsenal. Wartime murder During the Second World War, on 14 February 1944, Iris Miriam Deeley, a leading aircraftwoman with No 1 Balloon Centre was murdered near Well Hall railway station as she was returning to Kidbrooke. Her murderer, Ernest Kemp, was arrested a week later. He was tried and convicted at the Old Bailey, and, after being condemned to death, was executed at Wandsworth Prison on 6 June 1944. The site today The Kidbrooke training facility was on the site today occupied by Thomas Tallis School, in which the RAF Linguists' Association unveiled a commemorative plaque in 2008 (re-dedicated in July 2014). After the base's closure, much of the rest of the site was used for housing, with the Ferrier Estate (1968‚Äì2012) being constructed to the south of the railway lines. In the 1980s the Rochester Way Relief Road was built across the northern part of the site, alongside the railway line, carrying the A2 south of its earlier route. Part of the eastern side of the glider school site is now occupied by The Halley Academy (from 1954 to 2011, Kidbrooke School).

AMERICA BY DESIGN. 2013. p. 278. explained about the origin of The National Association of Corporation Schools, founded earlier that year. He explained: :\\"The idea of a national association of corporations maintaining or desiring to establish educational courses for their employees grew out of the experience of the New York Edison Company's commercial school. This company has for some years conducted free technical courses out of working hours at which attendance was optional, but the business-getting end of the industry had received little attention. In organizing a school for its salesmen the company found an enormous task on its hands. Being desirous of having the best salesmen possible, it was willing to spend large sums to perfect educational courses. A thorough canvass of existing practices in training employees for effective service was made and many corporation schools were visited. On the basis of these studies an educational system, involving lectures by experts and examinations based thereon, was inaugurated, and proved successful from the start...\\"F.C. Henderschott, \\"The National Association of Corporation Schools.\\" Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers 32.2 (1913): 1413‚Äì1416. And furthermore: :\\"The difficulty experienced by the Edison Company in securing data on corporation schools suggested the possibilities of an association that would act as a clearing house for corporations which, seeing the advantages to be gained by educating their employees, wish to start schools. Such an association should be of great assistance in improving and enlarging courses already started and increasing the efficiency of administration of these courses...\\" The National Association of Corporation Schools eventually came to life at a convention was held at New York University on January 24, 1913, at which a constitution was adopted, officers were elected and provision made for the appointment of working committees. As first president was elected Arthur Williams, an electrical engineer and executive at the New York Edison Company, as first vice-president E. St. Elmo Lewis, as second vice-president Charles Proteus Steinmetz, as secretary Lee Galloway, and as treasurer E. J. Mehren. Frederick C. Henderschott was elected assistant secretary-treasurer.The National Association of Corporation Schools. Bulletin, v.1, no.1-6 (inc.) (1914).

Second Vatican Council and Nostra aetate The question of Islam was not on the agenda when Nostra aetate was first drafted, or even at the opening of the Second Vatican Council. However, as in the case of the question of Judaism, several events came together again to prompt a consideration of Islam. By the time of the Second Session of the Council in 1963 reservations began to be raised by bishops of the Middle East about the inclusion of this question. The position was taken that either the question will not be raised at all, or if it were raised, some mention of the Muslims should be made. Melkite patriarch Maximos IV was among those pushing for this latter position. Early in 1964 Cardinal Bea notified Cardinal Cicognani, President of the Council's Coordinating Commission, that the Council fathers wanted the Council to say something about the great monotheistic religions, and in particular about Islam. The subject, however, was deemed to be outside the competence of Bea's Secretariat for the Promotion of Christian Unity. Bea expressed willingness to \\"select some competent people and with them to draw up a draft\\" to be presented to the Coordinating Commission. At a meeting of the Coordinating Commission on 16‚Äì17 April Cicognani acknowledged that it would be necessary to speak of the Muslims.(History of Vatican II, pp. 142-43) The period between the first and second sessions saw the change of pontiff from Pope John XXIII to Pope Paul VI, who had been a member of the circle (the Badaliya) of the Islamologist Louis Massignon. Pope Paul VI chose to follow the path recommended by Maximos IV and he therefore established commissions to introduce what would become paragraphs on the Muslims in two different documents, one of them being Nostra aetate, paragraph three, the other being Lumen gentium, paragraph 16. The text of the final draft bore traces of Massignon's influence. The reference to Mary, for example, resulted from the intervention of Monsignor Descuffi, the Latin archbishop of Smyrna with whom Massignon collaborated in reviving the cult of Mary at Smyrna. The commendation of Muslim prayer may reflect the influence of the Badaliya.(Robinson, p. 195) In Lumen gentium, the Second Vatican Council declares that the plan of salvation also includes Muslims, due to their professed monotheism.Lumen gentium, 16 See also * List of converts to the Catholic Church from Islam * Catholic Church in the Middle East * Catholic Church and Judaism * Christianity and Judaism References External links * https://www.thecatholicthing.org/2016/11/01/is-there-an- official-catholic-position-on-islam/ * http://www.ncregister.com/blog/guest- blogger/i-grew-up-as-a-muslimbut-then-rome-called#.WdIqjGi0NPb History of the Catholic Church History of Islam ","title":"Catholic Church and Islam"},{"id":"55416209","text":"Klein is an artist, singer-songwriter and producer from South London, England.

Photograph taken from a helicopter during final preparations for the 2017 event. Route 91 Harvest was a country music festival in the United States that was held annually in Paradise, Nevada from 2014 to 2017 in the Las Vegas Village, a lot on Las Vegas Boulevard (former U.S. Route 91), directly across from the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino and diagonally across from the Mandalay Bay resort and casino. The festival's promoters were Live Nation Entertainment and MGM Resorts International. No festival has been held since 2017, and as of now, no announcement has been made about a future event date. History The following country music artists were the major acts in the respective years: *2014: The inaugural festival featured Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert *2015: Florida Georgia Line, Thomas Rhett, Gary Allan, Lady Antebellum, Keith Urban, Tim McGraw and Brett Eldredge *2016: Headliners included Luke Bryan, Toby Keith, Brad Paisley, Little Big Town and Chris Young *2017: Major acts were Eric Church, Sam Hunt, Jason Aldean, Jake Owen and Lee Brice *Since 2018: No festival due to the 2017 shooting. 2017 shooting The festival was the scene of a mass shooting in which 60 people were ultimately killed, making the incident the deadliest mass shooting by an individual in U.S. history. The shooting began as singer Jason Aldean finished his sixth song on the final day of the festival and ended with gunman Stephen Paddock's suicide. More than 1,000 shots were fired into the crowd as the shooting continued over 15 minutes. More than 800 people were injured in the attack. At the time, the event was attended by approximately 22,000 people. Aftermath Following the mass shooting, organizer Live Nation decided not to hold the 2018 Festival. In December 2018, it was announced that the Festival might return in 2019, with it being held at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds at the corner of Sahara Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard. However, this event did not come to fruition. A January 2020 article in Billboard magazine on the possibility of the return of the Route 91 Harvest Festival cited several significant challenges that would need to be overcome. These included finding a new venue for the festival, being able to successfully coordinate the booking of numerous performers and competing with existing residencies of country stars in other Las Vegas venues.

He dedicated his life to various campaigns for Sikh rights to be recognised and respected in the United Kingdom. Principal among those were his fight for the turban including a seven year campaign for Sikh bus conductors in Manchester to be able to wear the turban as part of their uniform and his protest against The Motorcycle Crash Helmets Act of 1972 so Sikhs could legally be allowed to wear turbans instead of crash helmets. He was a well-respected pillar of the Sikh community and was involved in setting up one of the first Sikh temples (gurdwara) in Europe in Manchester in 1953. Early life and education Gyani Sundar Singh Sagar was born in the village of Ghalotian Kalan, Sialkot, Punjab, India (now in Pakistan). He started his education at the Scott Mission High School and went on to the Punjab University in Amritsar, where he graduated with an honours degree in Punjabi language and literature. His degree in religious studies earned him the title Gyani.Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 3 January 1997 Shortly following his graduation, he accompanied his father on a business trip to Great Britain, which contributed to his decision to permanently settle there after the Partition of India in 1947. During Partition, Gyani Ji's home in Sialkot suddenly became part of Pakistan, so the Sagar family had to flee to India. After living in India for a time, Gyani Ji settled in Manchester in 1948. He made a living at first as a freelance salesman but also spent much of his time, using his education, language skills and knowledge of Britain, to aid his fellow Sikhs across the UK. Personal life He married Rajendra Kaur in 1933 and they had three sons and three daughters.  Social activism  Manchester bus conductor uniform and turbans (1959‚Äì1967) In 1959 Gyani Ji applied to become a Manchester bus conductor. After being accepted he was then informed he would have to wear the full uniform, including the peaked cap, which would force him to abandon the wearing of his turban. Turbans are customary among observant Sikhs as they are connected to two of the 5 ks: uncut hair (kesh) which is kept neat with a ritual comb (kangha). Gyani Ji was rightly outraged at this unfair policy. Thus began a seven year-long campaign for religious tolerance and social justice with Gyani Ji taking on, not only the Manchester City Corporation, but also the unions. His main arguments throughout the debate were that; firstly, opposition to the turban stemmed \\"mainly from misunderstanding and ignorance\\" which he made strides to rectify, secondly, that the wearing of the turban was crucial to being a \\"proper Sikh\\", and thirdly, that turbans had been accepted as part of the uniform without issue in the British army when Sikhs had fought in both World Wars with 82,000 dying in battle.Beetham, pp. 20‚Äì21. In 1959, at the beginning of his campaign, only Sikhs employed in Newcastle-upon-Tyne were allowed to wear their turbans as part of the uniform.Beetham, p. 18.. It is noted that Gyani Ji used his extensive knowledge of local government and diplomatic methods such as writing to MPs, councillors, religious figures, senior military officials and other influential politicians as well as petitioning to get the result he wanted.Beetham, p. 7. It all started at a Manchester Transport Council Meeting in July 1959, Gyani Ji's local councillor Trevor Thomas, who supported his case; put forward an amendment to allow turbans as part of the Manchester bus conductor uniform. The arguments on both sides are described as: > On the one side it was argued that the Sikhs were being discriminated > against on grounds of religion. The rule about caps was largely a dead > letter anyway, and could hardly be worth making an issue about.... On the > other side it was pointed out that the Transport Department did not practice > discrimination, since it employed large numbers of coloured workers. To > allow a precedent in this matter could lead to all sorts of unauthorised > uniforms. Various bogeys were raised ‚Äì Scotsmen in kilts, dancing Irishmen > with pointed caps, and Muslims interrupting bus schedules with their prayer > mats. Finally, the practice of other Transport Departments in not allowing > turbans was used to support the Committee's decision.Beetham, p. 19. This battle was covered extensively in both the local and national press and went to several votes with the Transport Committee until the motion to allow turbans as part of the Manchester bus conductor uniform was finally passed in October 1966 with 71‚Äì23 in favour.Beetham, p. 20.. Upon hearing the news Gyani Ji's statement to the press was \\"This is a victory for the people of Manchester.\\"The Daily Telegraph 6 October 1966. . While there were remaining issues with the union and Gyani Ji had passed the maximum age to become a busman, at the beginning of 1970 a young Sikh man successfully became Manchester's first serving bus conductor to wear a turban on the job.Beetham, pp. 35‚Äì36. Turbans vs crash helmets: 1972‚Äì1976 In the early 1970s two Sikh men were stopped by police for wearing turbans instead of crash helmets on a motorcycle in Gravesend. This was against The Motorcycle Crash Helmet Act of 1972 and prompted the creation of The National Turban Action Committee. Gyani Ji was invited by the head of this newly-formed organisation, Baldev Singh Chahal, to lead campaigning to change the law so that Sikhs had the right to choose to wear a turban or a crash helmet. He later became the General Secretary of group between 16 November 1975 and 20 August 1977. Gyani Ji ensured that the issue was well-publicised and soon local and national media outlets were running stories on the problems of the \\"Urban Turban\\". One of his main campaigning methods, aside from prolific diplomatic correspondences with political figures, was to buy himself a moped in 1976 and ride it around Manchester while wearing his turban. He was stopped, arrested and fined by police multiple times. He refused to pay these fines to show he did not recognize the validity of the prejudicial law and bring further attention to the cause. Ultimately, this led him to be given a custodial sentence. Even though he was 57 years old and suffering from asthma and diabetes, Gyani Ji was not afraid of going to prison as it would further highlight the arguments he was making to amend the law, namely that if Sikhs had been allowed to lay down their lives for Britain during the Raj and two world wars without any legal compulsion for them to wear helmets instead of turbans, then they deserved the right to choose what to wear when riding a motorcycle. However, before he could serve his seven day sentence in Strangeways Prison, the Lord Mayor of Manchester paid his fines to spare him this punishment. Nonetheless, Gyani Ji carried on riding his moped while wearing a turban without paying his fines and was sentenced again and then finally served a week in Strangeways Prison in 1975. Upon his release from prison, Gyani Ji's sons and supporters met him at the gates of the prison with his moped and flower garlands. They were joined by the press and Gyani Ji proceeded to ride home wearing his turban and was stopped and booked seven times. He was prepared to serve an extended stay in prison for these actions. On 15 November 1976 an act to exempt turban-wearing followers of the Sikh religion from the requirement was passed through parliament. Gyani Ji was credited with being instrumental to this amendment. In the 1970s Gyani Ji was also involved in a dispute with the publishers of Chambers Encyclopedia concerning an error in their entry about Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism and the first of the ten gurus. The entry stated that Guru Nanak was a follower of Kabir, Indian mystic poet and saint. Subsequently, Gyani Ji was involved in over 400 correspondences, some of these with the later disgraced owner of Chambers, Robert Maxwell, to have this amended. Finally, after approximately a ten year period, they finally agreed to his changes and the offending entry was edited. Legacy Gyani Ji left behind a rich legacy for the Sikh community, Manchester and the UK upon his death in 1996. Throughout his life, aside from his social activism, he occupied important positions in the Sikh community such as Religious Advisor and Head of Turban Committee of the three Manchester Sikh Temples, Sikh Representative at the Executive of Manchester Council for Community Relations and other essential roles pictured. His tireless work for the promotion of religious tolerance and equality was covered in local and national press at the time but has also since been commemorated in many different ways. Gyani Ji's campaign for bus conductors to be able to wear turbans as part of their uniform was contrasted to others around the country, for instance in Wolverhampton, in David Beetham's Transport and Turbans: A Comparative Study in Local Politics, published in 1970. His obituary appeared in The Daily Telegraph on 3 January 1997. In 2016, Manchester Central Library organised an exhibition where his moped was put on display and his fight for the turban campaigns explained along with other crucial activists from the area. This was in collaboration with the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre and attracted many visitors. Equally, Lemn Sissay covered his campaigning in his BBC documentary Race Apart in 2015 to mark the fortieth anniversary of the Race Relations Act 1965.

The incident is the deadliest mass shooting by a lone shooter in United States history, with 61 fatalities (including Paddock) and 867 injuries, 411 of them by gunfire. Paddock shot himself dead in his hotel room. Paddock lived in Mesquite, Nevada, and was a real-estate investor, property manager, retired accountant, amateur pilot, and avid video poker gambler.  Early years and education  Paddock was born in Clinton, Iowa. The family lived in Clinton at the time. He grew up in Tucson, Arizona, and the Sun Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles, as the oldest of four sons of Benjamin Paddock. Benjamin was a bank robber who was arrested in 1960 when Stephen was seven years old. Benjamin was later convicted and escaped prison in 1969, subsequently appearing on the FBI's most-wanted list. According to Stephen's brother Eric, \\"he was never with my mom\\", and Stephen had \\"limited interaction\\" with Benjamin following the latter's release from prison. According to one of Paddock's ex-wives in a police interview, he had spoken about how growing up with a single mother and the family's financial instability caused him to prioritize being self-reliant and self-sustaining. Paddock attended Richard E. Byrd Middle School and Sun Valley High School, graduated from John H. Francis Polytechnic High School in 1971, and graduated California State University, Northridge in 1977, with a degree in business administration. https://www.dailynews.com/2017/10/02/suspected-las-vegas-shooter-graduated- from-sun-valley-high-school/  Career and gambling  Paddock worked as a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service from 1976 to 1978. After that, he worked as an Internal Revenue Service agent until 1984. He was a Defense Contract Audit Agency auditor for one year, in 1985. Toward the end of the 1980s, Paddock worked for three years as an internal auditor for a company that later merged to form Lockheed Martin. He is known to have run a real- estate business with his brother Eric. Paddock lived in the Greater Los Angeles Area and owned personal property in Panorama City, Cerritos, and North Hollywood from the 1970s to early 2000s. He also owned two apartment buildings in Hawthorne, California. In addition, he owned an apartment complex in Mesquite, Texas, which he sold in 2012. Relatives said Paddock was worth at least when he sold off the real-estate business. Among his most profitable investments was an apartment complex purchased in 2004, which gave him more than $500,000 in annual income by 2011. IRS records show he made $5‚Äì6 million in profits from its sale in 2015. Paddock was an avid gambler, and although the extent to which he profited from it is not clear, his reported gambling winnings might have been substantial. He was sometimes seen in high-limit rooms, but he was not well known among high-stakes gamblers in Las Vegas and was not considered a \\"whale\\" (high roller) by the casinos. His game of choice was video poker, which he had played for over 25 years. He usually gambled after dark and slept during the day; he disliked being out in the sun.  Personal life  Paddock was married and divorced twice. He was first married from 1977 to 1979, and for the second time from 1985 to 1990, both marriages in Los Angeles County, California. Family members say he stayed on good terms with his ex-wives. His brother Eric said that Stephen had no political or religious affiliations of any kind. Paddock's girlfriend, a Catholic, said he was an atheist who would blame her whenever she made the sign of the cross and something negative happened afterward. He did not talk a lot about politics and did not belong to any political organizations. In addition, Paddock often complained of being sick and was sensitive to chemical smells. Paddock lived in Texas and California, and then in a retirement community in Melbourne, Florida, from 2013 to 2015. In 2016, he moved from Florida to another retirement home in Mesquite, Nevada. According to property records, he bought a new house in Mesquite in January 2015, and sold his two-bedroom home in Melbourne. Paddock lived in Mesquite for several years with his girlfriend whom he had met in Reno, Nevada. According to neighbors, they also lived together in Reno. Many Mesquite residents recalled only seeing him around town; those familiar with Paddock described him as someone who did not speak much and kept a low profile. The local gun owner community never saw him at any of the gun clubs or shooting ranges, including makeshift ones in the nearby desert. An Australian acquaintance said he met Paddock in the United States and in the Philippines. He described Paddock as intelligent and methodical. In his account, Paddock said he had won a lot of money by applying algorithms to gambling on machines. Paddock was conversant in gun laws and in defending his view of the Second Amendment. The acquaintance considered Paddock a generous man whenever he and his girlfriend visited him. In 2010, Paddock applied for and received a United States passport. He went on 20 cruise ship voyages, visiting several foreign ports including in Spain, Italy, Greece, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates. He was accompanied by his girlfriend on nine of them. They went to the Philippines together in 2013 and 2014. During the last year of his life, they traveled on a cruise to the Middle East. Paddock had his pilot's license since at least 2004 and owned two small planes. Paddock's only recorded interaction with law enforcement was a minor traffic citation years before the shooting, which he settled in court. According to court records, Paddock also sued the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in September 2012, saying he \\"slipped and fell on an obstruction on the floor\\" and was injured as a result; the lawsuit settled, and was dismissed with prejudice in October 2014.  Leading up to the shooting  During his last months, Paddock reportedly often smelled of alcohol from early morning and appeared despondent. He was reported to have filled three prescriptions for the anti-anxiety drug Valium, in 2013 and again in 2016, and finally 50 tablets of 10-milligrams each in June 2017, four months before the shooting. The chief medical officer of the Las Vegas Recovery Center said the effects of the drug can be magnified by alcohol, as confirmed by Michael First, a clinical psychiatry professor at Columbia University. During an interview with local CBS affiliate KLAS-TV, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Paddock had reportedly been losing \\"a significant amount of wealth\\" since September 2015, which led to him having \\"bouts of depression\\". According to his girlfriend, she noticed a decline of affection and intimacy towards her from Paddock, who had been romantic at first during their relationship; he attributed it to his declining health. Paddock's gun purchases spiked significantly between October 2016 and September 28, 2017. He purchased over 55 firearms, the majority of them rifles, according to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He also purchased a number of firearm-related accessories. Prior to that, he purchased approximately 29 firearms between 1982 and September 2016, mainly handguns and shotguns. His girlfriend noticed the increase of firearm-related purchases but believed his interest in guns was just a hobby. At his suggestion, two weeks before the attack, his girlfriend went to her native country, the Philippines. Paddock bought her a surprise airline ticket and soon after wired her $100,000 to buy a house there. Most of their communication during this time was primarily through email and text message. He was spotted in Las Vegas with another woman, reported by investigators to be a prostitute. It was later confirmed that the prostitute was not an accomplice or considered a suspect, and her name has not been released. Two days prior to the shooting, Paddock was recorded by a home surveillance system driving alone to an area for target practice located near his home. In a jailhouse interview with an unemployed chef who said he had offered to sell Paddock schematics for automatic firearms, the chef said Paddock had spoken of anti-government conspiracies regarding FEMA and the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge standoff. In addition, the chef said Paddock had said that FEMA's actions after Hurricane Katrina were \\"a dry run for law enforcement and military to start kickin' down doors and ... confiscating guns.\\" The man went on to say he thought Paddock was \\"another internet nut, you know, watching too much of it and believing too much of it.\\"  Las Vegas shooting  On the night of October 1, 2017, at 10:05 p.m., Paddock fired more than 1,000 rounds from his hotel room, Room 32-135, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, onto a large crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip, ultimately killing 60 people and wounding 867 others. He then shot and killed himself. Paddock meticulously planned the attack. On September 25, six days before the shooting, he checked into the hotel with 10 shooting-range bags and a computer. On September 29, he moved into an additional suite, 32-134, connected to the first one; both rooms overlooked the festival grounds. He stayed in both in the days leading up to the shooting. After Paddock killed himself, the police found 23 rifles and one handgun inside his rooms. They included 14 .223-caliber AR-15-type rifles, eight .308-caliber AR-10-type rifles, one .308-caliber Ruger American bolt- action rifle, and one .38-caliber Smith & Wesson Model 342 revolver, all very expensive, according to a law enforcement source. His arsenal included a large quantity of ammunition in special high-capacity magazines holding up to 100 cartridges each. Also in: Also in: Some of the rifles were resting on bipods, and were equipped with high-tech telescopic sights. All fourteen AR-15-type rifles were outfitted with bump fire stocks that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire rapidly, simulating fully-automatic gunfire. Audio recordings of the attack indicated Paddock used these stocks to fire at the crowd in rapid succession. At some point during the attack on the concertgoers, Paddock ‚Äì who had placed a baby monitor camera on a service cart outside his room ‚Äì fired about 35 rounds through his door. The shots wounded approaching hotel security guard Jesus Campos. The unarmed Campos had attempted to enter the 32nd floor first at 9:59 p.m. on an unrelated matter, but he found the door to the hallway screwed shut by Paddock. ‚Äì An earlier report based on unrevised version of the events can be found at: At 10:05 p.m., Paddock began firing hundreds of rounds in rapid succession at the crowd below. He initially started off with a few single gunshots before firing in prolonged bursts. For unclear reasons, he stopped shooting ten minutes later at 10:15 p.m. It is speculated that, at that time, Paddock committed suicide by shooting himself through the mouth. According to chronology of the events established by the authorities in the following days, the first two police officers reached the 32nd floor of the hotel at 10:17 p.m. A minute later, they were shown the location of Paddock's door. Between 10:26 and 10:30 p.m., an additional eight LVMPD officers joined them and began clearing other suites along the 32nd floor hallway. At 10:55 p.m., eight SWAT team members entered the 32nd floor through the second stairwell nearest to Paddock's suite. Once all the other rooms on the floor had been cleared, at 11:20 p.m.‚Äîmore than an hour after the first two officers arrived and 65 minutes after Paddock had ceased firing‚Äîthe police breached his door with an explosive charge and entered the room. Paddock was found dead inside his suite from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.  Investigation  In addition to the firearms and accessories found in Paddock's hotel room, there was a note that included handwritten calculations about where he needed to aim to maximize his accuracy. The note contained the actual distance to the target, his own elevation, and the bullet trajectory relative to the line of fire. There were also a number of laptops in the suite, one of which was missing a hard drive. Computer forensics discovered hundreds of images of child pornography on the laptops. Ammonium nitrate, often used in improvised explosive devices, was found in the trunk of his car, along with 1,600 rounds of ammunition and of tannerite, a binary explosive used to make explosive targets for gun ranges. However, investigators clarified that while Paddock had \\"nefarious intent\\" with the material, he did not appear to have assembled an explosive device. An additional 19 firearms were found at his home. According to police, Paddock acted alone. His motive remains unknown. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility, and stated that he had converted to Islam six months prior to the terrorist attack,https://www.newsweek.com/isis- las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-muslim-six-months-massacre-679295 but United States law enforcement officials have given no evidence of a connection between Paddock and ISIL. ISIL also identified Paddock as Abu Abdul Barr al- Amriki. There has been some discussion around brain pathology initially thought to be benign as a possible contributor. Paddock's remains were sent to Stanford University to receive a more extensive analysis of his brain. The Stanford pathologists found no abnormalities present within the brain. Investigators believe that he was obsessed with cleanliness and possibly had bipolar disorder. Although a doctor did offer him antidepressants, he only accepted anxiety medication; it was reported that he was fearful of medication and often refused to take it. The doctor also described Paddock as \\"odd\\" and showing \\"little emotion\\". Psychologists ex post facto have noted a distinct similarity between Paddock's demeanor and the psychological construct alexithymia, which might have modulated his decision to conduct the shooting given its association with various mass murderers throughout history.

The fifth woman to hold a ministerial post in Denmark, she was the first to become Minister for Trade and Industry (1953‚Äì1957). Active in campaigning for women's rights, she headed the Danish Women's Society (Dansk Kvindesamfund) from 1958 to 1964. Biography Born in Copenhagen on 2 November 1910, Anne Lisbeth T√∏rsleff was the daughter of the educator Signe Andrea T√∏rsleff and the university lecturer P. Madsen Lindegaard. At Haderslev Katedralskole in southern Jutland, where her mother was principal, she was active in the students' association. When she was 18, she won the Politiken' contest in public speaking. The prize for this was a trip to Washington, D.C.. There, representing one of the 19 countries present, she was the only woman to address the audience of 4,000. While studying political science at Copenhagen University, she was an active member of the students' association. In 1931, she became the first woman to head the organization's steering committee. On graduating as \\"cand.polit\\" in 1935, she joined the Disablement Insurance Court. In 1936, she married her student colleague Ebbe Groes, and concentrated on raising a family of the nine children she had over the next 14 years. During the Second World War, she became president of the Danish Women's Society's youth circle, joining the central committee in 1943. After the war, she helped develop a new programme of work for the organization. In a speech titled Kvindesagens Maal (Objective of the Women's Movement), which she presented to the Nordic Women's Congress in 1946, she argued in favour of more respect for a woman's contribution to the family. She also fought for improved relations between working women and housewives. From 1953 to 1957, Groes was Minister of Trade and Industry. In particular, she developed the Bill on Monopolies and Pricing Agreements which was adopted in 1955. In 1958, she became a key proponent of progress on women and consumer issues. From 1958 to 1964, she was president of the Women's Society where she handled both domestic and international issues, including the development of women's rights in Greenland. She was also a member of the Folketing from 1960 to 1971. Lis Groes died in Copenhagen on 12 March 1974, and is buried in Mariebjerg Cemetery in Gentofte.

The ABTT Theatre show draws exhibitors and visitors from all over the world interested in topics such as lighting, audio visual, scenography, rigging, set construction, technical theatre and related technologies. History The ABTT Theatre show has been running since 1978, originally named The ABTT Trade show rebranded in the 2001 to make the annual event more accessible to a wider audience including front of house theatre services. This has resulted in the growth of both exhibitors and attendees. The show originally started in 1978 at the hands of principal organiser Roger Fox (still current Theatre Show director) and ABTT members Bob Anderson, Joe Aveline, David Adams and Richard York at the Donmar Warehouse Theatre, RSC Warehouse in Covent Garden, moving on to the Piccadilly Theatre in 1979. Fellow Ian Albery is part of the Albery theatre family who owned the Donmar Warehouse Theatre and the Piccadilly Theatre and facilitated the ABTT in getting the Theatre Show started. From 1980, the event was situated in the Shaftesbury Theatre; proceeding in 1981-82 to The Roundhouse and Riverside Studios during 1984-90. The Mermaid Theatre hosted the show in 1991 and then it relocated to The Royal Horticultural Halls where it stayed until 2011. The move from the Royal Horticultural Halls came after the sale of the hall to Westminster School ‚Äì who planned to convert the exhibition space in to a sports hall. The ABTT then moved the Theatre Show to The Old Truman Brewery in Shoreditch after deciding that an event space, rather than an exhibition hall would \\"provide everything we need to use‚Ä¶ (with it being ) a quirky venue‚Ä¶ exhibitors have welcomed the choice.\\" and since then Alexandra Palace has held the event from 2015 to present. In 2018, Roger Fox will be celebrating his 40th anniversary as Theatre Show Director along with the Theatre Shows 40th anniversary on 6-7 June 2018. Remit The purpose of the ABTT Theatre Show is to bring together drama schools, Trade Associations and live entertainment under one roof to help explore the connection between these different Industries. \\"The ABTT Theatre Show is an event where suppliers of goods and services meet up with industry professionals...(and students) involved in the staging of live performance.\\" The ABTT Theatre Show has been developed by the ABTT to be relevant across theatre, TV, film and commercial work. A broad range of technical disciplines are covered, bring relevant to venue operators, production staff, theatre consultants and students addressing issues of health and safety, codes of practice, live performance, academic development, and other relevant matters. Exhibitor Technology, Live performance and specialist advice is made available for a wide range of issues which relate to theatres and places of entertainment. These include theatre design, sound design, stage lighting, live performance, and issues relating to health and safety issues matters that relate to places of entertainment. ABTT Awards Each year the Theatre show presents the ABTT Awards. These started in 1976 and were then hosted alongside the Theatreshow from 1984. This has progressed from the initial \\"product of the year\\" in the 1979‚Äôs a variety of awards including \\"technician of the year\\" and \\"stand of the year\\". In 1993, this altered from an initial ABTT Awards ceremony to the \\"ABTT Awards and Dinner\\" with in excess of 150 people attending.

Originally the residence of the Landgraves of Hesse-Homburg, it was first built in the 12th century. All but the keep was demolished in 1660 by Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg. He replaced the old castle with a new one designed by Paul Andrich between 1680 and 1685. Its grounds and gardens were landscaped in the 18th and 19th centuries, including the addition of the Gothic House. It was inherited by Hesse- Darmstadt after Prussia's annexation of Hesse-Homburg in 1866 following the Austro-Prussian War, becoming a summer residence for the kings of Prussia. William I stayed at the castle several times, as did his son and successor Frederick III and Frederick's wife Victoria. The castle was a particular favourite of Frederick and he and his successors added bathrooms, telephone rooms and electricity and merged some rooms. After 1918 the castle was administered by the Prussian state and from 1945 by the state of Hesse. From 1947 it housed the Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schl√∂sser und G√§rten Hessen (Hesse Administration for State Castles and Gardens).

Description Cymbopogon bombycinus is a tufted perennial bunchgrass, without stolons or rhizomes. The culms, or stems of the grass, range from in height and are smooth, though the nodes may be hairy. The leaves of the plant are in length and are wide, and smooth on both faces. The crushed leaf gives off a strong citrus-like scent. The inflorescence of the plant, or the collections of flowers, are composed of long section of spikelets largely concealed by long hairs. Taxonomy The species name bombycinus is derived from the Greek \\"bombyx\\" and \\"bombykos\\", meaning \\"silk\\" or \\"silk-garment\\", referring to the silky hairs of the spikelets. The name is also derived from the Latin \\"bombyx\\" and \\"bycis\\", meaning \\"silk\\" or \\"silk-worm\\", referring to the same silky hairs. Habitat and ecology Cymbopogon bombycinus is found mostly in southwestern areas of Australia, in tropical and subtropical regions of Queensland, New South Wales, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. The species occurs on sandy and stony soils along stream banks or on alluvial flats, and occasionally in eucalyptus woodlands. Uses Aboriginal peoples of Australia burn and rub the plant on the body for colds and pain, and soak the plant in water and use the liquid to treat sore eyes. The plant is also eaten in the summer despite its strong aromatic scent, but the plants becomes harsh as it ages and is seldom eaten old.

Van Kane. Future Planetary Exploration. 1 October 2017. VOX would produce global, high resolution topography and imaging of Venus' surface and produce the first maps of deformation and global surface composition, thermal emissivity, and gravity field to study the interior structure of the planet. Current data are suggestive of recent and active volcanism on Venus, and this mission could determine if current volcanism is limited to mantle plume heads or if more widespread. The Principal Investigator for VOX is Suzanne Smrekar at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Smrekar was the PI of the VERITAS orbiter proposal to Venus that competed in 2015 for the Discovery Program 13 mission. VOX is a reformulation of VERITAS proposed in 2017 to NASA's New Frontiers program mission 4 to compete for funding and development, but it was not selected. Overview Although the Announcement of Opportunity called for a Venus lander, the VOX scientific team is proposing an orbiter with a payload capable of achieving the required objectives. The VOX proposing team explains: \\"At the time of the Decadal Survey the ability to map mineralogy from orbit and present-day radar techniques to detect active [surface] deformation were not fully assessed because their development was still ongoing. VOX leverages these methods and in-situ noble gases to answer [the key] New Frontiers science objectives.\\" The VOX mission concept would have the orbiter deploy a small, simple atmospheric probe, the Atmospheric Sample Vehicle (ASV), to measure the key gases and isotopes. The rest of the measurements would be made from instruments on the orbiter over at least three years. The mission was last proposed in 2017 to NASA's New Frontiers program mission 4 to compete for funding and development, but it was not selected.NASA's New Frontier Mission Will Search For Alien Life Or Reveal The Solar System's History. Elana Glowatz, IB Times. 20 December 2017. Objectives The VOX mission objectives are: *Investigate atmospheric physics and chemistry, including noble gases and their isotopes. *Investigate Venus' past hydrological cycles to determine the role of volatiles in crustal formation. *Investigate crustal physics and chemistry and determine the global tectonic framework and heat flow, whether catastrophic resurfacing occurred, and any type of geologic processes that may be currently active. *Investigate crustal weathering by constraining global mineralogy and surface-atmosphere weathering reactions. *Map cloud particle modes and their temporal variations, and track cloud level winds in the polar vortices. *Investigate surface-atmosphere interactions, create mineralogy maps and search for new and/or recent volcanism and outgassed water during a three- year global search. Proposed payload The orbiter would carry two scientific instruments and a radio: *A radar called Venus Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (VISAR) would generate high-resolution imaging of the surface at 15 m to 30 m resolution, and search for minute changes in surface elevations to look for evidence of current volcanic or tectonic activity by performing repeat-passes during 3 years. *The Venus Emissivity Mapper (VEM) would employ a spectrometer using five near-infrared wavelengths where the atmosphere is transparent to map the chemical composition at the surface, and thus determine whether tesserae regions formed in the presence of water.VERITAS (Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topo-graphy And Spectroscopy): A Proposed Discovery Mission.

Measurements in additional bands would study cloud structure and cloud displacement (indicating winds), and would search for water vapor in the lowermost atmosphere. *The orbiter's radio signal in the Ka-band would provide the gravity field resolution needed to estimate global elastic thickness, and map the gravity field at high resolution to study the interior structure of the planet. Atmospheric Sample Vehicle The VOX mission concept would have the orbiter deploy a small atmospheric probe called Atmospheric Sample Vehicle (ASV), previously named Cupid's Arrow. The probe would enter the atmosphere at such speed and angle that it will bounce back into space after collecting an upper atmospheric sample. Once back in space, a miniaturized quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer would measure the key gases and isotopes.Cupid's Arrow: An Innovative Nanosat Mass Spectrometer to Sample Venus' Upper Atmosphere. (PDF) Murray Darrach, C. Sotin, S. Madzunkov, E. Neidholdt. HEM's Workshop. 2015. Measurements of xenon and its isotopes, yet to be made at Venus, would resolve key questions about the origins of the atmosphere and the cumulative volcanic activity. Similarly, a long-lost ocean at Venus would be reflected in the ratio of hydrogen isotopes.

He started his military career as a lieutenant in the Belgian infantry, later he entered service in the Force Publique, where he commanded Congo Free State forces during the Congo Arab war. Lothaire was married to the sister of Francis Dhanis. On 7 May 1894, Captain Francis Dhanis returned to Europe and Lothaire assumed command of the Force Publique in the 'zone arabe' in his stead. Charles Stokes trial Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert- Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the Ituri- campaign, learned that Charles Stokes was on his way from German East Africa to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. In December 1894, Lothaire sent Lieutenant Josu√© Henry with 70 men ahead to capture Stokes. Henry arrested Stokes in his tent, taking advantage of the absence of a large part of his caravan, that was out in the jungle gathering firewood and searching for food. Stokes was taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court-martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies (Said Abedi, Kilonga Longa and Kibonge). On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). The procedure is said to have had many irregularities, including the use of false statements. There was no penal code, no clerk, the verdict wasn't read out loud to the convicted, and Stokes did not have a right of appeal, which as a British citizen he was entitled to. Initial reactions To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with Arab slave-trading, then 'he deserved hanging'. Sir John Kirk, for years the British Consul in Zanzibar, remarked that \\"he was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.\\" The news of Stokes' execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this \\"well-known character\\", Sanderson wrote: ‚ÄúI do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.‚Äù The Stokes Affair In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the Pall Mall Gazette. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The Daily News emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation' , The Times a 'painful and disgraceful death', The Liverpool Daily Post 'horrified amazement through the British race', The Daily Telegraph 'death like a dog', adding 'Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner -not to speak of any savage chief- would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of Queen Victoria'.Roger Louis, W. (1965). \\"The Stokes Affair and the Origins of the Anti-Congo Campaign, 1895‚Äì1896\\". Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire. 43: 572‚Äì584. As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose martial law or death sentences on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family. Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association and the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state in 1908.Roger Louis, W.

His elder brother Claude was made a baronet in 1805. Philip Champion de Crespigny was probably educated at Eton College in 1748, and was an advocate of Doctors' Commons in 1759. In 1768 he became King's Proctor and held the post until 1784. In 1774 he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Sudbury on the Fonnereau interest after a contest, but lost his seat on petition. In 1780 he was returned unopposed at Aldeburgh, also on the Fonnereau interest, as well as at Sudbury after a contest. He held both seats until 1781, when he lost Sudbury on petition, and continued to sit for Aldeburgh.

Reviews  Novelist Carole Maso has written that \\"Sheridan's photographs, moments generated from the real stage, isolated and freed from their context, their burden of narrative, take on a compelling, mesmerizing drama of their own. These scenarios, having lost their coordinates, are allowed to exist in a kind of staged-for-no-one space where they have a fresh, gently surrealist existence.... At once passionate and dispassionate, logical and deranged, she photographs from the depths of her psyche with wonder and aplomb.... This is the truth upon which Sheridan's seductive and fierce photographs insist.\\" Her work has been characterized as ‚ÄúPowerful and surreal‚Äù and ‚Äúfrighteningly full of real human emotion and mystery.‚Äù According to one reviewer, Sheridan‚Äôs ‚Äúkeen eye...has allowed her to capture fleeting moments of intensity, emotion, and action while maintaining a spare visual elegance and a surreal touch.‚Äù  One-woman exhibitions  May 1997.

Around it formed an eponymous village, today separated into upper and lower. It has a rectangular floorplan, with a central tower. It survived in good condition much longer than most castles in the region.  Geography  The castle is located about 6 km down the old road from Duga Resa. It is near a rock quarry. The parish church in the 1334 ecclesiastical census was Sv. Juraj in Grabrje across the river from the castle, but that parish vanished, and in the 15th century, the parish church of Sv. Ivan, which still exists, and includes inscriptions from the years 1526, 1587, and 1687, was founded. Radoslav Lopa≈°iƒá infers from the inscriptions and the fact that the Church had been abandoned for 30 years in a 1558 document, that the year inscriptions are years of rebuilding.  History  A 1639 military sketch of the castle. Zveƒçaj in its early days had its own nobility, originally using the name \\"od Grabrja\\" (1334), but later changing it to \\"od Zveƒçaja\\" (1414, 1441) or Zveƒçaji. Around Zveƒçaj there lived a number of other low noble families: Toliƒái, Babinogorci, and Zubci. The last Zveƒçaj to be lord of the castle was Ivan, who married Katica, the daughter of Nikola Benvenjuda, lord of Skrad, who is mentioned as a widow in 1481. Upon the death of Ivan Zveƒçaj, the castle and surrounding lands were given to Nikola Frankopan Ozaljski by king Matthias Corvinus. In 1474, upon the death of Nikola Frankopan's son Bartol, that branch left their heritage to Stjepan Frankopan Modru≈°ki, his son Bernardin Frankopan, and his grandson Stjepan Frankopan Ozaljski. In 1558, the castle was pillaged together with the rest of the possessions of Stjepan Ozaljski, yet it had already been abandoned as a result of the Ottoman wars. There were only 38 \\"sela\\" (which in medieval times meant a house and its dependencies) in the domain of Zveƒçaj left. The region btwn the Mre≈ænica and the Korana was found to be completely abandoned. In 1580, after a legal feud following the death of Stjepan Ozaljski regarding his controversial will, which left his property to the Zrinski family while there was still a branch of the House of Frankopan left, the castle of Zveƒçaj, together with Novi Vinodolski and Severin, fell to the brothers Frankopan Tr≈æaƒçki. In December 1598, a Turkish army 5000 strong hid in ambush near Zveƒçaj, Juraj Lenkoviƒá heard about the force, but underestimated its size. He took a smaller army, and when they met, the Turkish army pushed Lenkoviƒá's back, and many drowned in the Mre≈ænica, and Stjepan Blagaj was beheaded, ending his family's male line, though Lenkoviƒá and his men managed to escape, having been in the rear. In 1608, when the brothers divided their property, Zveƒçaj and Novi went to Vuk. In 1670, after Fran Krsto Frankopan was imprisoned as a result of the Magnate conspiracy, the castle was looted by the army of Karlovac. The Frankopan line died out with the death of Fran Krsto in 1671. The castle was destroyed in 1777 for the construction of the Josephina. Upon the ruins of the castle walls now sits a private house, built from its stones. All that remains are the walls themselves and parts of the tower. In 2001, the surrounding village had 226 inhabitants,https://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/Census2001/Popis/H01_01_03/H01_01_03.html in 74 families.https://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/Census2001/Popis/H02_01_02/H02_01_02.html  See also  * List of castles in Croatia * Military history of Croatia  References  Castles in Croatia Ruined castles in Croatia Buildings and structures in Karlovac County Tourist attractions in Karlovac County ","title":"Zveƒçaj Castle"},{"id":"55417536","text":"BALLOONS Lit.

She served as managing director of the off-Broadway Greenwich Mews Theater in New York City for 15 years. Holt was known for being one of the first producers in New York to use racially integrated casts. Early life and education Beatrice Holtzer was born in 1899, and later changed her name to Stella Holt. She lost her sight at age 17, but said that she found her blindness \\"no real handicap.\\" Holt graduated from Cornell University and initially found employment as a social worker before becoming frustrated by her inability to create meaningful change on behalf of her clients. She shifted her focus to putting on art exhibitions, and said \\"I found, if any, that my talent lay in organizing.\\"  Career   Greenwich Mews Theater  Holt became managing director of the Greenwich Mews Theater in 1952, and went on to produce 38 plays at the theater. She would select which plays to produce by going through submissions with her life partner Frances Drucker, a former high school teacher with whom she had a 20-year relationship. Her preference was for \\"plays of serious content, poetic quality\\". She was skeptical of the over-reliance on spectacle in other productions of the time, and professed her desire to \\"follow the project of the author in a straightforward way.\\" Under Holt's leadership, the theater produced plays by Alice Childress, Padraic Colum, Ren√© Marqu√©s, and Sean O'Casey. Its production of Monday's Heroes, a play written by Lester Pine, featured a young Zina Bethune in her first acting role. Playwright Tennessee Williams praised her production of his Orpheus Descending, which he preferred over the film adaptation and previous Broadway production. Actors Claudia McNeil, Diana Sands, and Gilbert Price were among those seen on the stage at the Greenwich Mews. Holt produced the work of many leading Black writers at the Greenwich Mews Theater, including Langston Hughes, Loften Mitchell, and William Branch. Her theater was one of only a few producing shows with integrated casts, which was seen as \\"experimental\\" at the time. In 1955 she presented Alice Childress's first full-length play, Trouble In Mind, which is a specific critique of the experiences of Black artists in the white-dominated theater industry. In 1965, the Cuban-born director Gilberto Zald√≠var joined Holt as an associate producer at the Greenwich Mews, becoming co-producer with Drucker after Holt's death.  Collaboration with Langston Hughes  Holt produced Langston Hughes's play Simply Heavenly in 1957, with a budget of $4,200 and a cast of 17 actors, including Mel Stewart and Claudia McNeil. The production transferred to Broadway after 44 performances. Holt next collaborated with Hughes as a co-producer on Jerico- Jim Crow in 1964. In 1965 she brought his Prodigal Son to the Greenwich Mews under the direction of Vinnette Carroll. Prodigal Son drew large crowds in New York, and buoyed by this success Holt put together a European tour. The touring production was plagued by financial issues, including late payment of the touring company. Holt was largely blamed for these problems, and according to playwright Isaiah Sheffer, \\"some of her business practices were, to put it mildly, highly questionable ... I saw enough hanky-panky and cutting of corners to wonder about her ethics.\\" In the year before her death, she and Langston Hughes had planned to rename her theater The STELLA Holt/Langston Hughes Theater. Langston Hughes died suddenly on May 22, 1967, and Stella passed only 3 months later the same year, on August 28. It was said she died of a broken heart and ‚Äúfollowed him to his grave.‚Äù Death Holt died on August 28, 1967 at age 50 of a heart attack at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City.

Firefighters found their bodies in the house's master bedroom after putting out a fire there. Both had suffered stab wounds which were found to have killed them; the case was initially believed by the Somerset County prosecutor's office to have been a murder-suicide. Six months later, prosecutor Geoffrey Soriano made that conclusion official in a public report. However, even before its release, the Sheridans' sons, led by Mark, who at the time served as chief counsel to the state's Republican Party, had challenged that. Based on a second autopsy done by Michael Baden, who wrote his own report, they believed it was more likely that their parents had been killed by an intruder who set the fire in an attempt to destroy evidence. The Sheridan sons vowed to have the finding overturned, and exercised considerable political influence to do so. A 2016 open letter to newly appointed state medical examiner Andrew Falzon supporting a change in the finding was signed by 200 prominent state residents, including three former governors and two former state attorneys general. In 2017 Falzon officially changed the manner of John Sheridan's death from suicide to undetermined. Their efforts to change the verdict revealed a number of deficiencies in the state's medical examiner system generally and the investigation of the Sheridan's deaths specifically. Before Falzon's appointment, the position had been vacant for six years following the resignation of a predecessor who had resigned out of frustration with the system and himself replaced another predecessor who resigned for the same reason. The pathologist who performed the autopsies on the Sheridans was not board certified, had resigned from a previous position due to a failure to inform police about a changed autopsy finding, and may have yielded to pressure from the prosecutor's office. One of the detectives who had initially been part of the investigation filed a whistleblower lawsuit, later dismissed, alleging he had been subject to retaliation after he had complained about how evidence related to the case was either mishandled or destroyed. Background John Sheridan, a senior partner in the Morristown law firm of Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti, was a lifelong Republican whose career in New Jersey state government during the 1970s had culminated in his service as Transportation Commissioner in the cabinet of Governor Thomas Kean from 1982 to 1985. In that capacity he had overseen the transfer of commuter rail service in the state from federally-owned Conrail to the newly created New Jersey Transit Rail Operations. He later served on the transition teams for Republican governors Christine Whitman and Chris Christie following their elections. He and his wife Joyce had settled in Skillman, an affluent section of Montgomery Township in Somerset County, a short distance north of Princeton. There they had raised four sons, twins Mark and Matt, and Dan and Jim. Mark himself followed in his father's footsteps, reaching the level of senior partner in the global Squire Patton Boggs law firm and serving as chief counsel to New Jersey's Republican Party. In 2005, he had left Riker Danzig to take over as chief executive officer of Cooper University Hospital in Camden. Working together with the chairman of the hospital's board, George Norcross, a prominent Democratic leader in South Jersey, he oversaw an expansion of the hospital into what is today called Cooper Health System. The new facilities included a four-year medical college and cancer center. Deaths Shortly before dawn on September 28, 2014, local firefighters responded to a report of flames at the Sheridans' house on Meadow Run Drive. Smoke was coming from one area of the second floor that turned out to be the master bedroom. After entering through the unlocked front door, the firefighters went upstairs and easily put out the fire, fueled by gasoline that had been poured on the floor as an accelerant. Also on the floor, they found the bodies of John and Joyce, lying face up. John was pronounced dead at the scene, as was Joyce after her body was taken to University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro. The can from which the gas had been poured also was nearby, along with matches and knives. A heavy wooden armoire had fallen across John Sheridan's body, breaking several of his ribs; his wife had suffered first- and second-degree burns over many parts of her body. There were stab wounds on both bodies. Joyce Sheridan's body had 12 stab wounds, mostly on her head and hands. One that pierced her aorta was found to be the lethal wound; her death was thus called a homicide. John had only five such wounds, mostly on his neck and torso; soot was found in his lungs during the autopsy, suggesting he had been alive when the fire started. The medical examiner deferred listing a cause of death \\"pending further investigation.\\" A week later, a memorial service was held for John and Joyce at Patriot's Theater at the Trenton War Memorial. The family was joined by hundreds of mourners, including Governor Christie and his predecessors Thomas Kean, Christie Whitman and Democrat Jim Florio. Many of the public officials present praised John Sheridan's career and accomplishments. \\"The city of Camden is a different place because of his vision,\\" Norcross said. The actual funeral was private. Investigation The investigators clashed with the Sheridan family from the morning the bodies were found. Responding firefighters notified Matt Sheridan, who lived at the house with his parents but was away from it on a fishing trip on Fishers Island off the coast of Connecticut, from which he began making his own way home. He in turn called his twin brother Mark, a senior partner in the Newark office of the global law firm Squire Patton Boggs celebrating his wedding anniversary with his wife at a hotel on New York's Upper East Side, who drove down to the house. When he arrived he found it surrounded with crime scene tape and was not allowed in. After Matt Sheridan arrived, police found a small quantity of cocaine in his car. He was also in possession of a digital scale and plastic bags coated with white powder on the inside. They put him under arrest, but did not charge him at that time. On Mark's way there, he picked up his brother Tim and learned that Somerset County prosecutor Geoffrey Soriano was on the scene. Since he did not know Soriano personally, he called Chris Porrino, chief counsel to Governor Christie (and later the state's attorney general), who had appointed Soriano. Mark knew Porrino from his own work as chief counsel to the state's Republican Party. Soriano called him as he arrived at the scene and told him that the fire appeared to be arson and that John and Joyce had been fatally stabbed. The Sheridans, all of whom made their way to the scene of the fire that morning, assumed that their parents had been killed by an intruder and that police would be searching for who might have done it. However, within a week, Soriano's office made statements reassuring the public that there was no danger of further attacks. \\"We are quite confident that there exists no threat to either the immediate neighborhood or to the local community,\\" his spokesman said. At a meeting with Mark, Soriano explained how investigators had come to murder-suicide as the most likely explanation for the couple's deaths. John Sheridan's body, he told Mark, had hesitation wounds, commonly found on people committing suicide by cutting themselves. Soriano told Mark that detectives would be looking through the couple's phones, emails and other records for evidence of extramarital affairs, financial problems or domestic violence that might explain a murder- suicide, and which he believed from his experience would turn up. All the Sheridan brothers found the theory highly doubtful. They knew their parents well and had seen no sign of any issues between them that might have led to such a violent end. They hired Michael Baden, a well-known former forensic pathologist who had been the chief medical examiner for New York City and had hosted HBO's Autopsy, to assist and consult with deputy state medical examiner Eddy Lilavois. Baden and Lilavois agreed that the stab wounds to both bodies had been caused by the same knife. They could not determine whether that knife was one of the two recovered at the scene, both kitchen knives. One, in fact, was designed for slicing bread and therefore had a serrated blade with a rounded tip, features that would not have made it the best choice for stabbing someone. It was likelier that it had been a third knife which had perhaps not yet been found. In addition to going through the Sheridans' records, detectives interviewed 180 friends, family and coworkers. Those efforts turned up nothing suggesting any major issues with either of them that could have prompted the crime. The only sign that either of them might have had some reason to be unhappy was from John's job. According to Cooper's chief counsel, Gary Lesneski, John was worried about the effect an upcoming state report on high fatality rates at the hospital's cardiac unit, a report they expected to be very negative, might have on the hospital. But Lesneski said he had left it as a work issue for the weekend, and one of his last emails, a lengthy response to a question from Norcross written the evening before the fire, was well-composed and lengthy, typical of Sheridan and showing no sign its author was emotionally distressed. The toxicology report on John and Joyce yielded no new information. John's blood had the signs of the heart medication he took, and Joyce had a high level of prescription painkillers. This was due to the continuing consequences of a fall she incurred in her last year of work as a schoolteacher, around 1999, that had injured her back and required multiple surgeries and orthopedic treatments. \\"Mom was on enough meds to kill a small farm animal,\\" Mark Sheridan later told The New York Times Magazine. DNA from the blood on the knives was tested, but did not reveal anything conclusive. The amount collected was insufficient to test for anything more than the racial characteristics and gender of the source. The blood on them had come from a white male. During the investigation, the Philadelphia Inquirer filed a lawsuit seeking disclosure of the case reports and other records related to it. The court sided with the state and kept them sealed. Family questions Around the time of Mark Sheridan's meeting with Soriano, he and his brothers were allowed to re-enter the house as the investigation of the scene had concluded. In the master bedroom, where the fire had been, they found a melted lump of metal next to where their father's body had been found. What it had been was not certain, but the brothers believed it might have been the third knife, although it could have been a knob from the armoire as well. If it was, it was not part of the set of knives in the kitchen from which the other two had come. Their blades were made from alloys that required high temperatures to melt, temperatures that would only be achieved in a structure fire if it burned the whole house, or at least the whole room. That had not been the case with the Sheridan house, where the fire only damaged part of the room. John Sheridan's undershirt, which he was wearing when he died, was only charred, not burned. Mark Sheridan sent Soriano a lengthy email expressing his frustration with this and other apparent failures of the investigation. The melted metal object was not the only item of evidence that the Sheridans believed investigators had overlooked. A month after the fire, an insurance adjuster inspecting the house found a fireplace poker in the adjoining bedroom, odd since the house has no upstairs fireplace. The brothers theorized that that could have been the cause of John Sheridan's broken ribs instead of the falling armoire. Report In late March, Soriano released his office's report on the death of John Sheridan. It found no evidence of an intruder, and concluded that he and Joyce were the only ones in the house. Instead of being undetermined, his death was now considered a suicide. Soriano said detectives had conducted 180 interviews and looked through all the couple's records. It quoted some unnamed witnesses describing John as \\"'disproportionately concerned,' 'genuinely worried' and 'overly worried' \\" about the upcoming state report on the cardiac unit's problems. Reportedly he was planning a meeting with some coworkers at the hospital the day he died. Robbery was ruled out as a motive since nearly a thousand dollars in cash remained on a nightstand; jewelry and prescription drugs that might have been of interest to a thief had also not been taken. The house had not been forcibly entered, nor had neighbors reported any prowlers in the area before or immediately after the fire. DNA from the blood on the knife, Soriano wrote, was consistent with John Sheridan. Based on the lack of evidence for other theories, and the five hesitation wounds, Soriano concluded that the deaths had, as investigators originally believed, been a murder-suicide. His report did not speculate on how the Sheridans came to end their lives that way, whether it had been planned (as the presence of the gas can, brought up from the basement to start the fire, and the kitchen knives suggested might have been the case) or the result of a sudden impulse or fight between the couple, or what the motive might have been. A single wound to the jugular vein, in conjunction with smoke inhalation from the fire, was given as the cause of death. In the one interview he has given about the report, Soriano dismissed the melted piece of metal the brothers found. \\"I don't know what it is. It could have been anything\\" he told Star-Ledger columnist Tom Moran. \\"What we tried to do was gather all the relevant evidence\\", he said when asked about the report's failure to convincingly identify a motive. \\"I don't know what else was going on in his life.\\" Criticism Mark Sheridan had been in regular contact with Soriano and was able to review the report in its final drafts before it was made public. He strongly disagreed with its conclusions, and expressed that opinion in news coverage. \\"\\"To be clear, we do not have answers to what happened to our parents,\\" he said in a statement on behalf of himself and his brothers. \\"Based on the evidence, neither do the investigators.\\" \\"I've said to the prosecutor, 'It's bad enough you‚Äôre calling my father a murderer, but you're also calling him a moron, as though he weren't smart enough to work this out.' \\" If his father genuinely wanted to kill himself and his wife, Mark said later, he would have planned it in such a way as to leave no doubt. Other members of the family agreed. \\"The prosecutor's conclusion destroyed their legacy and the good that John and Joyce had done in their lives\\", said John's brother Peter, a federal judge. In addition to the uncertainties created by the metal object and the poker found later, the brothers believe it was impossible for the crime to have been committed as the prosecutor imagined it had. They had, in private conversations, considered the possibility that their mother, known to be more prone to angry outbursts than her husband, might have initiated something which escalated into what the firefighters found. But, they realized, the Joyce would have had to raise her hands above her shoulders to inflict her husband's fatal wound, and with her chronic upper-back pain from her injury it would have been unlikely that she could have, or that if she had she would not have been able to strike with sufficient force. Baden, in an affidavit filed with the brothers' later court action, went further in his criticisms of the prosecutor's conclusions. John had not shown any signs of suicidal ideations or depression before his death, he noted. None of the knives present could have caused any of his thin and deep wounds, not even the purported hesitation wounds, he claimed (nor did he believe the melted metal had been a knife). The angle of John's neck wound, downward and slightly forward, was also consistent with being attacked. And if John had stabbed Joyce, some of her blood should have been on him, but none was. While Baden did not feel the evidence necessarily pointed to an intruder, he did say some evidence supported that conclusion. Blood spatter on the walls was consistent with an attack, and contrary to Soriano's assertion that the stabbing had been confined to the Sheridans' bedroom, there was blood on the wall near the top of the stair. The injuries to John's upper body, including the broken ribs, could just as easily have resulted from being struck repeatedly with the poker as from the armoire falling on him. He also had had a chipped front tooth not noted in the initial autopsy report, but without the bruises on the face that would be expected if the armoire had caused it. Baden also had his colleague Henry Lee review the results from the DNA on the knives. While Soriano had said the DNA was consistent with John Sheridan, the lab report had only said that due to the minimal amount available it could only be determined with certainty to have come from a white male. Lee told Baden that they had a genetic pattern that did not match any male member of the Sheridan family. Baden believed it was more likely that both Sheridans were victims of a homicide, perhaps by someone who intended to kill them both or a burglar caught unawares. \\"If it's murder-suicide, it's a very unusual murder-suicide\\", he told the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2016. However, he said the evidence was not strong enough to call the case a homicide, instead advocating for it to be changed to \\"undetermined\\". Dennis Cogan, a former Philadelphia prosecutor turned defense attorney who reviewed Baden's affidavit for the Inquirer, agreed. \\"The missing knife is so overwhelming that there's a third person who did this,\\" he said. He believed that Soriano and his investigators had attempted to make whatever facts they found fit their original theory rather than following them where they led. As a result of his discontent with Soriano's conclusions, Mark Sheridan decided to step down as the chief counsel for the New Jersey Republican Party so he could concentrate on reversing them (although he continued to represent the party and Governor Christie's office in some matters related to the George Washington Bridge scandal). He vowed to use the influence he had to block Soriano's reappointment to the prosecutor's office in the coming fall. The family offered $250,000 for any information leading to the identity or arrest of whoever had killed John and Joyce. =Problems with state medical examiner system= Mark also connected his parents' case to the general problems of New Jersey's medical examiner system. \\"[It's] a disaster, an embarrassment. MEs should not be under the attorney general or law enforcement. They should not be agents of the state\\", he told The Star-Ledger. Some of the state's former chief medical examiners agreed with him. At the time of John and Joyce's deaths, the position of chief medical examiner, in fact, had been vacant for six years (without someone even being designated acting chief). Victor Weedn, the previous chief, had resigned in 2009, telling Governor Jon Corzine that he found the experience \\"disappointing\\" and lacking the statutorily required oversight from the Attorney General and the state's Division of Criminal Justice. He noted that all but the first two chief medical examiners appointed since the position had been created late in the 20th century had similarly resigned in frustration. A new chief medical examiner, Andrew Falzon, was appointed by Governor Christie in June 2015. Problems with the system were worse at lower levels in ways that may have directly affected the Sheridan case. The Northern Regional Medical Examiner's office, under whose auspices Lilavois worked, had failed to achieve reaccreditation by the National Association of Medical Examiners in 2012. Among the failings noted, one of the most serious was that the toxicology lab, which served the entire state, had let its accreditation by the College of American Pathologists lapse in 2009, and was not then listed as certified to conduct testing by the American Board of Forensic Toxicology. Lilavois himself was not board certified in forensic pathology, although he had been performing autopsies since 1997. He had come to work for New Jersey after resigning from the New York City medical examiner's office following an incident where he had revised a finding of death in the case of a Queens three-year-old from homicide by blunt force to natural death by brain aneurysm. However, despite making the change three weeks after the original autopsy following a review with a colleague, he did not notify either the police or the child's family for almost a year; both learned of the change only when the New York Daily News obtained a copy of the amended death certificate as part of its reporting on the case. In the interim police had continued to investigate the case as a homicide, and the boy's parents had gotten divorced, with the father viewed by everyone as having killed his son. Because of the vacant state medical examiner position, no one supervised Lilavois' autopsy of John Sheridan. Mark believes that that might be the reason the pathologist's report misstates his father's height, weight and age. In later comments on the case, Weedn says it would not have mattered even if there had been a chief medical examiner, since the state medical examiner has no statutory or regulatory oversight authority over county or regional medical examiners, who are appointed by county governments. \\"The state medical examiner is merely a figurehead\\", said Faruk Presswala, Weedn's predecessor, who also resigned over that. Sheridan also faulted Lilavois's lack of independence from the prosecutor's office. He noted in a letter to John Jay Hoffman, then the state's Acting Attorney General, that Lilavois had met with Soriano three times before the prosecutor issues his final report, and did not issue his pathological finding until just before the report was published. According to Sheridan the county prosecutor held those meetings to convince Lilavois to rule the case a murder-suicide. Weedn says New Jersey's medical examiners need to be under the jurisdiction of an independent office not under law enforcement jurisdiction. \\"People get rewarded for convictions, they get raises and promotions. There is an essential bias\\" argues Lawrence Kobilinsky, chair of the science department at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and chair of the Northeastern Association of Forensic Scientists. While law enforcement and medical examiners do need to be able to communicate and coordinate their efforts, the latter should be under the jurisdiction of a state's health department to remain independent. \\"It is essential that these organizations remain independent of each other\\", Kobilinsky told the Star-Ledger. =Response= There was some backlash from the Sheridans' criticism. Following Mark's comments in news stories criticizing both Soriano and his report, Raymond Bateman, a former State Senate president and the Republican Party's 1977 gubernatorial candidate, wrote an op-ed piece in the Home News Tribune, Middlesex County's daily newspaper, defending Soriano. Bateman's son Christopher, who had followed his father into the State Senate, had sponsored Soriano's nomination. Bateman took it as an established fact that John Sheridan, whom he knew from his own days in the State Senate, was mentally ill in some way when he died. He compared him to Andreas Lubitz, the pilot who shortly before the report's release had deliberately crashed a Germanwings flight into the side of a French mountain, killing 149 passengers and crew in addition to himself, and was later found to have been suffering from depression severe enough that he feared losing his commercial pilot's license. \\"As I write with tears about my friend, John,\\" Bateman wrote, \\"I recognize that mental depression must just completely overwhelm a person's normal judgment.\\" Although he had agreed with Sheridan about the failings of the state medical examiner system, Weedn defended Lilavois' conclusion. Based on reviewing the autopsy reports, he found the couple's injuries \\"more consistent as a generality with a murder-suicide\\", although he qualified that by saying he had not seen the photos. Weedn said it was unlikely that a burglar or intruder would have confronted the Sheridans in their bedroom; such struggles usually occur on the ground floor of a house closer to any entrance that might have been used. He agreed that the possibility of homicide could not be ruled out, particularly if the blade used could not be found. Court challenge and whistleblower lawsuit In December 2014, Mark and his brothers had sent Baden's affidavit to the state's and chief medical examiner, asking that their father's cause of death be recorded as undetermined. They received no reply, and over the next few months let the state know that if John Sheridan was officially ruled to have taken his own life, they would file a lawsuit. After Soriano's report was released, they did. The state's initial response was to move that the suit be dismissed for lack of standing. \\"No legal basis exists to compel a medical examiner to change his opinion about manner of death\\", the Attorney General's office wrote in its response. A three-judge panel ruled that the case should be filed against the medical examiner's office. While that suit was pending, two other developments occurred in early 2016 that supported the Sheridans' cause. In February a group of 200 prominent state residents, including three former governors, two former attorneys general, a former justice of the state Supreme Court and many lawyers, signed an open letter asking the medical examiner to change the finding. Three months later, a Somerset County detective filed a whistleblower lawsuit claiming that \\"It was common knowledge among detectives assigned to the Forensic Unit that the Sheridan evidence was improperly collected, improperly preserved and subsequently destroyed\\" and that he had been retaliated against for complaining about this. Specifically, Detective Jeffrey Scozzafava's suit alleged that: * The officers running the prosecutor's Forensics Unit had little or no experience in that area of police work; * Large pieces of charred bedding from the Sheridans' bedroom were left lying on the floor of the truck that had brought them to the lab for months, then stored in an open bag in the fingerprint lab; * Blood collection swabs were not packaged properly after being taken; * Evidence envelopes were not properly taped shut, and ... * A supervisor told the prosecutors that the officers had searched for fingerprints using a non-existent \\"flashlight technique\\", which Scozzafava characterized as an excuse for not having done it at all. When he pointed these failures out, the detective said, he was reassigned to a unit dealing with fugitives, a less prestigious position. He later claimed to have seen the Forensics Unit's supervisor throwing the improperly collected and stored evidence in the garbage during 2015. In January 2017, the Sheridans prevailed. State medical examiner Andrew Falzon, after reviewing the evidence, changed the manner of John Sheridan's death from suicide to undetermined. While Falzon still said he believed the wounds were self-inflicted, \\"no weapon was recovered from the scene that could be conclusively associated with the wounds sustained by Mr. Sheridan.\\" The damage to the scene caused by the fire further compounded the difficulty of reconstructing events that night. Mark Sheridan said that while the family felt vindicated by the change, \\"we have a long way yet to go\\". They called for the case to be reopened and reinvestigated. At the same time, Soczzafava's suit was dismissed after oral argument. The county had argued that his claim was really motivated by \\"being assigned a Chevrolet rather than a Dodge\\" and that since he still worked full-time in the prosecutor's office he had not been harmed. Scozzafava's lawyer said his client planned to appeal. Other subsequent events While the brothers' suit was pending, in February 2016, Christie, himself a former federal prosecutor, decided not to reappoint Soriano to a second term, saying later he had \\"lost confidence\\" in him. News stories about the move cited not only the Sheridan case, but other recent cases in which Soriano's office had come in for criticism. He was replaced by Michael Robertson, also a former federal prosecutor, who had served under Christie when the governor was United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. \\"It's long overdue that someone took charge of that office,\\" Mark Sheridan said, upon being informed by a reporter. \\"I think there has been a long history of failures [there].\\" However, state senator Christopher Bateman, who had recommended Soriano to Christie at the beginning of the governor's terms, was disappointed. Although the governor had denied to him the Sheridan case had anything to do with his decision to replace Soriano, \\" the timing is just too coincidental\\", coming so soon after the open letter. \\"He did the best he could with the Sheridan investigation. If it came down to that, it's wrong.\\" By that fall, Soriano had been hired as one of the state's assistant attorneys general. Two months later, Matt Sheridan was indicted by a Middlesex County grand jury on the cocaine possession charge that had led to his arrest on the morning of his parents' deaths a year and a half earlier. Despite having expressed discontent with his twin brother for this having happened, Mark accused the prosecutor's office of having sought the charge only as retaliation for the family's efforts to change John's death certificate. He claimed that this violated a promise that had been made by Soriano shortly after the deaths. Due to the conflicts between the family and the prosecutor's office, the case was handled by the Middlesex County prosecutor's office, although any trial would take place in Somerset County.

Somerset Maugham. It was first produced at the Haymarket Theatre, London on 3 March 1921, and has been revived several times in the West End and on Broadway. The play, which caused some outrage among a small minority of playgoers at the time of the premiere, depicts a young married woman contemplating leaving her husband for another man, and looking to an elderly peer and his partner, who eloped thirty years earlier, for advice.

At the beginning of the play, the prim Arnold is dreading the first visit of his mother, Lady Catherine Champion-Cheney, and her partner, Lord Porteus. She had caused scandal by eloping with Porteus thirty years earlier, leaving her husband and only child. Arnold's wife, Elizabeth, is looking forward to meeting Catherine, whom she sees as a romantic figure for sacrificing her social position in England for love. In reality the older couple are not romantic figures: Catherine hates being rejected by polite society, dresses and makes up too young for her years, \\"a ridiculous caricature of a pretty woman grown old\\",Maugham, p. 41 and regards her partner as \\"simply a testy, crotchety old gentleman who makes himself a nuisance at the bridge table\\". Nonetheless, they remain bound together by reluctant affection. Their visit is complicated by the unexpected arrival of Arnold's father, the deserted Clive Champion-Cheney, but he is quite friendly to the couple.Maugham, p. 51 Elizabeth is tempted to repeat history by eloping with Edward Luton, a friend of her husband, aware that in doing so she would be sacrificing a comfortable life in England for the probable hardships of life as a planter's wife in Malaya. Arnold, to whom she confesses her emotions, gives her his blessing to leave him if she wishes. This calculated ploy, suggested to him by his father, makes her feel so guilty that she almost resolves to end her relationship with Edward, but the latter tells her candidly that he offers her love and not necessarily happiness. This decides her in his favour, and Porteus and Lady Catherine lend them their car to elope in. Clive, unaware that his ploy has failed, joins Porteus and Catherine, boasts of his clever plan, and the play ends with \\"all three in fits of laughter\\" Maugham, p. 92 Revivals The play was produced in New York, running from September 1921 to February 1922, bringing in $20,000 a week. The first London revival was in 1931. Aynesworth again played Porteus; the cast also included Athene Seyler, Nigel Playfair, Frank Vosper, and Celia Johnson. The Circle was revived in New York in 1938 with Tallulah Bankhead as Elizabeth. John Gielgud revived the play to open his London repertory season in 1944, playing Arnold, with Leslie Banks as Porteus and cast members including Yvonne Arnaud, Cecil Trouncer and Rosalie Crutchley. In 1990 The Circle was presented in New York with a cast headed by Rex Harrison, Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger. Reception and critical opinion The Circle was \\"the first of Maugham's plays to be booed\\". As The Times put it, \\"It is, of course, a bold ending ‚Äì too bold, apparently, for some orthodox moralists in the gallery last night ‚Äì but approved, we think, by the more mundane majority in the house. The writer Robert Bechtold describes the play as a comedy of manners ‚Äì \\"a rewrite of Lady Windermere's Fan a quarter of a century later in a post World War I atmosphere.\\" The critic of The Times took a different view: :Outwardly cynical The Circle may be, yet it is by no means a comedy of manners. The moral implicit in its fun is something very different from the sententious couplets which Congreve perfunctorily tagged on to plays which pretended to neither feeling nor morality. ... The \\"bold\\" ending is surely frivolity's rather wistful salute to sincerity.\\" Adaptations The play was adapted for the cinema in 1925 under the same title.

The referendum, which was held in defiance of Spanish national court orders, resulted in over 900 people injured as the national police attempted to prevent Catalans from voting. The violence galvanized separatist support for the strike, whose planning predated the crackdown, and led to endorsements from the Catalan government, the Catalan branches of the country's two largest labor unions, and pro-independence cultural groups. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, including 700,000 in Barcelona, participated in the strike. Despite high tensions, protests were civil, festive, and without incident, similar to prior pro-independence rallies. While protesters targeted Spanish police and national government sites, other effects included suspended public transportation and port activities, canceled university classes, and closed businesses small and large. Immediate effects of the strike included an emergency meeting called by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior and a rare televised address by Spanish King Felipe VI that condemned Catalan disloyalty and notably did not mention police violence during the referendum. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont announced that the regional government would declare unilateral independence, which it did later that month.  Background  Catalonia held a contentious referendum on its independence from Spain on Sunday, 1 October 2017, against orders from the Spanish central government. The national police enforcement attempted to prevent Catalans from voting in some locations with violent crackdowns that resulted in about 900 people injured and separatist calls for a general strike. By the time of the strike, the Catalan government was awaiting final referendum results before acting on what they had preliminarily announced as 90 percent support from about 2.3 million voters. The legitimacy of a declarative result was disputable for reasons of general population turnout, voter rolls, and independent confirmation. Sky News described the events as Spain's largest political crisis since its 1930s civil war. Police violence during the referendum galvanized Catalan unions and cultural associations in support of the general strike. Smaller unions planned the strike in advance of the referendum and their efforts were compounded by strike endorsements given the night of the referendum from pro-independence cultural organizations √ímnium Cultural and the Catalan National Assembly as the vote was tallied. Supporters ultimately included the Catalan government and the Catalan branches of Spain's largest unions: the Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores (UGT) and Workers' Commissions (CCOO). (Their national leadership, however, advised Catalans against participating, adding that protests should be nationally coordinated. For legal reasons, the labor unions additionally referred to the strike as a labor dispute, despite its political purpose.) Together, the dozens of pro- independence groups were known as the Taula per la Democr√†cia, or Board for Democracy. They called for three million Catalans, including business owners, workers, and the self-employed, to withhold their work and bring Catalonia to a halt. At the time of the strike, Catalonia represented a fifth of the Spanish gross domestic product, comparable in size to the Chilean economy. Separatists hoped that the strike would become a major demonstration, leading shop owners to shut down as protesters moved downtown.  Actions  Deltebre to Sant Jaume d'Enveja in southern Catalonia On 3 October, two days after the referendum, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators blocked roads across Catalonia, including main thoroughfares in Barcelona. Farmers blocked highways with their tractors. By 9:30 a.m., the Barcelona bus and subway systems were almost entirely halted. Catalonia's railway company suspended service, the national railway ran minimally, and the ports of Barcelona and Tarragona closed, as did places of work from small stores to the large, wholesale food- trading market Mercabarna. Universities canceled classes and the large public market La Boqueria was nearly empty. The strike included the staff of the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art and Sagrada Fam√≠lia basilica, and Barcelona's football team, FC Barcelona. Barcelona's airport and most other large industries, however, ran without disruption. Many students and farmworkers participated. By midday, in Barcelona, tens of thousands of people occupied the city's major streets‚ÄîAvinguda Diagonal, Gran Via, Via Laietana‚Äîen route to the major demonstrations at the city's administrative center, Pla√ßa Sant Jaume, and the intersection of Barcelona's other city squares at Ronda de la Universitat. Demonstrators gathered before the region's town halls before a planned action at 6 p.m. Barcelona city police later estimated the city's crowd to be 700,000 people in size. The Spanish police were a focal point of protest as a response to their actions during the referendum. A manifesto from the Board for Democracy, read from atop a car, called for withdrawal of Spanish security forces and more dialogue in lieu of force. It charged the state with aggressive violation of the public's \\"fundamental rights and democratic liberties\\". Protesters chanted, \\"Spanish police get out!\\" Demonstrators surrounded the hotels housing Spanish police to demand they leave Catalonia, which was also demanded by Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont. In the small towns of Calella and Pineda de Mar, protests led some hotels to eject their Spanish police guests. Xavier Garc√≠a Albiol, the leading Catalan figure of the Spanish prime minister's party, was booed when voicing his support of the Spanish police in Pineda de Mar. Protests at the National Police Corps station in Barcelona continued from the day prior for its role in repressing the referendum. Demonstrators also protested the and showed broad contempt for the Spanish press, whom they accused of manipulative reporting and casting separatists as greedy and violent. Despite high tensions, protests were civil, festive, and without incident, similar to prior pro-independence rallies. In one case, a protester who threw a beer can into riot police was surrounded by fellow protesters who chanted \\"We are a people of peace\\" and encouraged him to leave. Firefighters and the Catalan police acted in an improvised role as peacekeepers at some protests. In one instance, the Catalan police defused a volatile standoff by convincing the Spanish police to leave. Posts on social media encouraged peaceful protest and resistance to incitement. The Catalan government forewarned against plainclothes officers who may infiltrate gatherings to sow discord. Some shops were forced to close by protesters who graffitied \\"strikebreakers\\" on their storefronts. The Estelada flag of Catalan independence Protesters also sought to maintain momentum from the referendum. Some wore the Estelada (separatist flag) in yellow, red, and blue. Crowds sang Catalan singer Llu√≠s Llach's \\"L'Estaca\\" and the Catalan anthem, \\"Els Segadors\\". On the Via Laietana, they chanted \\"Withdraw the forces of occupation\\" and \\"The disgrace of Europe\\" to the tune of the rock song \\"Seven Nation Army\\".  Effects  The strike led the Spanish Ministry of the Interior to call an emergency meeting, and Spanish King Felipe VI to give a rare televised address that blamed Catalan leaders and the referendum for destabilizing the nation and showing \\"disloyalty towards the powers of the state‚Äîa state that represents Catalan interests.\\" He did not mention the police violence during the referendum, the main cause for the strike. Barcelona's mayor condemned the speech for its lack of solutions and appeal for dialogue. Catalans responded with a cassolada protest, in which residents publicly made noise with pots and pans. The union of the Spanish military police compared circumstances in Catalonia to the violent 1981 peak of the Basque conflict, in a warning to police. The police union asked Spanish politicians to protect or withdraw those stationed in Catalonia. The security forces deployed to Catalonia were put on standby for the upcoming week. On the first night of the strike, their union filed complaints: that the Catalan police had not fulfilled its duties by not enforcing the Spanish court ban of the referendum, and that 200 officers were kicked out of a Calella hotel following a threat from the town's mayor. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy remained unrepentant, but met with opposition parties in Madrid. The spokesman for his party derided the \\"political\\" strike, compared the separatist function to Nazi indoctrination, and called for Catalan separatist leader Puigdemont to be banned from public office. Puigdemont, in turn, charged the Spanish government with returning to the authoritarian dictatorship of Franco. The first night of the strike, Puigdemont said that the Catalan government would declare independence within a week. Later that month, Catalonia declared its independence. Red Pepper said that the action was \\"perhaps the first large- scale workers' strike against state repression in Europe for over 40 years\\" with solidarity between workers across professions: dockworkers refusing to accommodate armed police boats, firefighters protecting demonstrators, and farm workers creating blockades with tractors. The labor union Intersindical- CSC called for a follow-up general strike a week later‚Äîfrom 10 to 16 October‚Äîwhich it later retracted. A month later, multiple Catalan groups called for another general strike against the Spanish government's actions against the Catalan independence process, to take place on 8 November, which closed roads across Catalonia but was much smaller in scale than the general strike.

Goodhue (September 20, 1869 ‚Äì July 19, 1957) made pioneering contributions to the education of handicapped and exceptional children. Working with the University of Washington Goodhue participated in studies to evaluate the background and educational abilities of children with special needs and conducted clinics to assist in the development of special classes. Early life Goodhue was born on September 20, 1869, in Northfield, Minnesota, the daughter of Daniel Goodhue (1832‚Äì1902) and Ellen E. Stanton Goodhue (1844‚Äì1909). Career She was director of the Child Study Department for the Seattle public schools and instructor for the Normal School. In 1910 she taught the first class for Seattle students with mental disability. In 1912, working with the University of Washington, the Seattle Board of Education and the Cascade School, Goodhue participated in an extensive study on handicapped children evaluating their backgrounds, health status, learning abilities, motor skills, and other factors. Running extensive testing, the program was designed to develop training programs for disabled children and establish benchmarks for ongoing assessment. In an effort to share their information, Goodhue presented seminars to assist in the development of special education classes. The needs of misfit pupils always interested her and when the Child Study Department of the Seattle public schools was organized, she became its first Director in 1914. From 1916 to 1925 Goodhue led an unsuccessful campaign to establish a Western Washington Institution for the Feeble-minded. Because the Seattle School Board had a policy of excluding disabled students from public education, Goodhue campaigned for their inclusion and won the battle to include all students with IQs above 50. The Department served 6,970 pupils during 1926‚Äì1927. She was on the Board of Directors of the Local Chapter of the American Red Cross. She was a member of the Soroptimist Club, State Association of the Executive Women in Education, State Mental Hygiene Society. She was the first principal of Washington School and made pioneering contributions to the education of handicapped and exceptional children. The Shoreline Health and Guidance Center, at 13720 Roosevelt Way N., constructed in 1946 as an administrative building by the Shoreline School District, was turned into a center for mentally handicapped children in 1954. Against a policy of the Seattle School District policy that forbid to name school after living person, the school was dedicated to Goodhue. Nellie Goodhue School closed in June 1961. Personal life She moved to Washington in 1908 and lived at 1407 E. 45th St., Seattle, Washington. She died on July 19, 1957, and is buried at Oaklawn Cemetery, Northfield.

The Allies' need for such patrols was reduced by the surrender of Germany in May 1945 and ended by the surrender of Japan in August. However, the need for military transport aircraft remained high. Military transport tasks in the months after the end of hostilities included restoring transport links with recently liberated countries in what had been German-occupied Europe. Aircraft were needed to deliver supplies and equipment, and to repatriate nationals of formerly-occupied countries who had served in Allied forces. In their years of exile many of those nationals had got married and started families whom they now wished to take home with them. Therefore, in June 1945, 311 Squadron was transferred to RAF Transport Command and started flying GR.VI Liberators that had been converted into military transport aircraft. In each aircraft a temporary wooden floor covered the bomb bay doors. A cargo and passenger doorway was inserted in one side of the fuselage. If passengers were to be carried, wooden benches were installed. The colours of the aircraft remained as they had been under Coastal Command: white on the sides and underneath, with camouflage only on the upper surfaces. In August 1945, 311 Squadron was transferred from RAF Manston in Kent, England to Ruzynƒõ Airport, Prague, Czechoslovakia to continue transport operations. Flight history Aircraft KG867 carried the marking PP-N. PP was the code for 311 Squadron and -N identified the individual aircraft. Its captain was Pilot Officer Jaroslav Kudl√°ƒçek, a 25-year-old from Chrudim in eastern Bohemia. He had 1,421 flying hours' experience, 512 hours of which were on four-engined aircraft. Kudl√°ƒçek had got married to a British woman, their first son had been born in October 1941 and the family was looking forward to the boy's fourth birthday. Kudl√°ƒçek had just returned from the Royal Hospital, Wolverhampton, where Mrs Kudl√°ƒçkov√° had given birth to their second son about 10 days previously.The People, 7 October 1945 KG867 was scheduled to make a flight from Blackbushe to Ruzynƒõ on Thursday 4 October to repatriate Czechoslovak service personnel and their families to their homeland. P/O Kudl√°ƒçek tried three times to take off but aborted each time because of a problem with one of the engines. After Kudl√°ƒçek aborted the third attempt the flight was postponed until the next day to let KG867 be examined and repaired. One account states that the passengers were given temporary accommodation for the night. But another account, by Warrant Officer Pavel Svoboda of 311 Squadron, said \\"We spent a very unpleasant night, due to a lack of accommodation, especially the women with children.\\" By the next morning KG867's passenger manifest had been changed. Two 311 Squadron personnel who had been booked to fly as passengers ‚Äì Warrant Officer Svoboda and WAAF Leading Aircraftwoman First Class Edita Sedl√°kov√° ‚Äì were displaced and their seats were reallocated to other passengers. On Friday 5 October three Liberators including the rescheduled KG867 were to take off from Blackbushe. KG867 got airborne in good weather. Differing accounts suggest that it took off at either 1243 hours or 1420 hours. The aircraft made a normal circuit of the airfield as it turned to head for Prague. At the Liberator's cruising speed of the flight could be expected to take more than three hours, so KG867 was carrying a substantial amount of fuel. Engine fire and crash Then about three minutes into the flight, witnesses on the ground saw a fire had broken out on the aircraft's main wing around the No. 2 (inner port) engine. One Witness, George Greenwood of 4167 Squadron RAF, said he saw \\"a great plume of black smoke from one of the engines\\". Elvetham Hall, on whose estate KG867 crashed The plane was losing height and Kudl√°ƒçek tried to turn back to the airfield. About short of the airfield KG867 turned steeply to port, with the port wing down and diving at an angle of 30 degrees. About five minutes after take-off the port wing clipped a hedge causing the port engines to hit the ground in a field of sugar beet at Elvetham, east of Hartley Wintney. The aircraft cartwheeled, disintegrated and burst into flames. The field was part of the Elvetham Hall estate of Sir Fitzroy Calthorpe, Baronet. A group of gypsies had been trimming the sugar beet and were sitting around a log fire eating a meal. They had a narrow escape as the Liberator crashed and burst into flames only away from them.Coventry Evening Telegraph, 6 October 1945 In another field nearby a group of children was helping a farmer to pick potatoes. One girl, who was 12 at the time, recalled seeing KG867 fly over with its port wing down and both starboard engines \\"running very fast\\" before passing out of sight and crashing. The farmer told the children each to take a large potato and go home. She recalled that for days afterwards \\"Nobody was allowed to go anywhere near the crash. There were many lorries and people at the site for almost a week investigating the wreckage.\\" George Greenwood recalled that RAF Blackbushe was \\"stunned into silence\\". Another of the 311 Squadron Liberators due to fly that day was already taxiing on the airfield when KG867 crashed. The control tower recalled it and instructed the aircraft to wait. But later it was cleared to take off, and its crew was not told of the crash until after they had landed in Prague. Victims The accident killed all 23 people aboard the aircraft. The five crew consisted of a pilot, co-pilot, navigator, wireless operator and flight engineer. The co-pilot was Warrant Officer Anton√≠n Bro≈æ, aged 31, from Hradec Kr√°lov√© in northern Bohemia. The flight engineer was Flight Sergeant Zdenƒõk Sedl√°k, aged 33, from Prague, who was the husband of LACW Sedl√°kov√° who had been booked to travel on the flight but whose seat had been reallocated to another passenger. The 17 official passengers included nine women, one of whom was Marina Paulinyov√°, aged 46, who was Vice-Chairman of the Czechoslovak Red Cross in London. Also among the passengers were five children travelling with their mothers. The eldest, Eva ≈†afrankov√°, was three years old. Ji≈ôi Rosenblum and Helena ≈Ωaludov√° were two years old. Twins Lad√≠slav Sobƒõslavsky and Marenka Sobƒõslavsk√° were just 18 months old. The body of another person was found at the crash site. It was so badly burned that investigators could not tell if it was that of a man or a woman. At first its identity was a mystery. But LACW Sedl√°kov√°, the wife of Flt Sgt Sedl√°k, the flight engineer, had been reported missing after KG867 took off and she failed to return home to her flat in London. Sedl√°kov√° had been born Edita Hermannov√°, a Czechoslovak Jew who reached the UK as a refugee after the Germans murdered her parents. She enlisted in the WAAF and was posted to 311 Squadron, where she and Sedl√°k met. They were married in May 1945. Sedl√°kov√° was described as \\"a high-spirited girl\\" who was \\"deeply in love with her husband\\". About a fortnight before the crash, Sedl√°kov√° had secured her discharge from the RAF so that she and Sedl√°k could return to their homeland together. She was last seen at Blackbushe in the vicinity of luggage that was to be loaded onto the aircraft. Either by herself or with the help of others she had boarded KG867 unauthorised. Sedl√°kov√° was the only WAAF fatality in the six-year history of 311 Squadron. Being displaced from the flight saved Warrant Officer Svoboda's life. He recalled \\"my name was taken off the manifest to go, and I was replaced by reason I was never informed\\" (sic). Cause D√©bris was scattered at the crash site. Burnt pieces of cowling from the inner port engine were found about before the point of impact. One of the starboard engines had been thrown about away from the point of impact. Other wreckage was thrown up to ahead of the point of impact. The official investigation found: > The port inner engine caught fire due to a petrol escape from a ruptured > pipe between the carburettor and oil dilution valve due to chafing. Ignition > believed to be from exhaust pipe conduit to turbo supercharger. The fuel pipe would then have been burnt away, which would have caused fuel starvation to the No. 1 (outer port) engine. With the port wing on fire and both port engines out of action, the aircraft would have been increasingly difficult to control. Inside a Liberator cockpit, looking forward. The co- pilot's seat is on the starboard side (right). The aircraft had no fire detection or warning devices. But it had two built-in CO2 fire extinguishers to fight engine fires. The extinguishers were not automatic. There was a control panel on the starboard side of the cockpit, from which the co-pilot would operate the extinguishers when instructed by the pilot. Investigators found that both of the extinguishers had been discharged. This suggested that a member of the crew, presumably the co-pilot, Warrant Officer Bro≈æ, had tried to extinguish the engine fire. Access to the control panel was poor, as it was partly obstructed by an emergency pump for the aircraft's hydraulic equipment. The fire extinguisher control panel included selector switches for the co- pilot to select which of the four engines to douse with CO2. Investigators found that aboard KG867 the selector switch for the port engines was in the \\"off\\" position and the selector for the starboard engines was switched to extinguish the inner starboard engine. This suggested that in the emergency, Warrant Officer Bro≈æ may have selected to extinguish the wrong engine by mistake. The presence of an unauthorised extra passenger aboard, LACW Sedl√°kov√°, was not considered to have contributed to the accident. Aftermath and burials On 6 October 1945 the Czechoslovak Government announced it has terminated the repatriation of its nationals from the UK by air transport. Thereafter they were sent by ship from a British port to Ostend in Belgium, and then onward by train across Belgium and Germany with the assistance of NMBS/SNCB. The Czechoslovak Embassy in London announced that about 400 people would leave Britain by sea for Ostend on 11 October, followed by about another 400 on 26 October and about 1,200 in November. Also on 11 October, 18 of the victims of the crash were buried at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey. All five of the aircrew were laid to rest in the Czechoslovak section of Brookwood Military Cemetery. 13 of the passengers share a common grave in part of the civilian cemetery in Long Avenue called the Old Roman Catholic Ground. The common grave has one headstone bearing the names of those 13 passengers, including stowaway Edita Sedl√°kov√°. A separate, smaller plaque commemorating Sedl√°kov√°'s RAF service was added in front of the monument in November 2015. Five of the passengers are not buried in the shared grave at Brookwood. They are Marta Obrazov√°, Ji≈ôi Rosenblum, Anna Rosenblumov√°, Otto Schwarz and Helena Wodakov√°.

Albania is geographically located in South and Southeast Europe within the Balkan Peninsula. It borders on Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, the Republic of Macedonia to the east, Greece to the south and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. The total length of the coastline is approximately , of which are taken up by white sandy beaches and the remaining by different landforms. The Adriatic Sea is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea merely extending all the way from the Strait of Otranto in the south up to the Po Valley in the north. The sea is apportioned into two major basins, wherein Albania is entirely located within the deepest and southernmost one. The coastline is one of the wealthiest scenery of the country in terms of biology, holding an outstanding diversity of ecosystems and biodiversity found within a precious mosaic of wetlands, estuaries, capes, sand dunes, marshlands, forests and marine habitats. At different times, numerous ancient people, most notably the Illyrians and later the Ancient Greeks and Romans, have established significant settlements around the shores. They were considerably influenced by their direct proximity to the sea because it provided routes for trade, colonization and war, as well as food; the Via Egnatia, that crossed through the mountains of Albania, was at that time among the most significant routes in the Roman Empire. The coastline is populated by more than 1.500.000 million people. The most sizable cities are Durr√´s and Vlor√´ placed in the north and south, respectively. Durr√´s is served by Port of Durr√´s, one of the largest on the Adriatic Sea, which connects the city to Italy and other neighbouring countries within the Adriatic.  Environment   Geography  Albania is geographically located on the Balkan Peninsula in South and Southeast Europe bordered by the countries of Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, the Republic of Macedonia to the east and Greece to the south and southeast. The western edge touches the Adriatic and Ionian Sea, both within the Mediterranean Sea. The majority of the country's territory consists of mountains and hills, making Albania one of the most mountainous countries of Europe. Likely the Albanian Alps runs in the north the Korab Mountains in the east, the Ceraunian Mountains in the south and the Skanderbeg Mountains in the center, while the plains and plateaus are principally to be found in the west. The Albanian Ionian Sea Coast is known for its rugged natural beauty, with rocky highlands and a great marine life, while the Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast consist of sandy beaches and shallow coastal waters hosting a great wildlife. Administratively, the Albanian Adriatic coast is shared between the counties of Shkod√´r in the north, Lezh√´, Durr√´s, Tirana, Fier and Vlor√´ in the south. The Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast begins from the estuary of Buna whitin the Gulf of Drin at the border with Montenegro, passes through Myzeqe Plain, the capes of Rodon, Turr√´s, Gjuh√´zes, the cities of Sh√´ngjin, Durr√´s, Vlor√´, the estuaries of Drin, Mat, Ish√´m, Erzen, Shkumbin, Seman, Vjos√´ and the lagoons of Karavasta, Narta Kune-Vain- Tale and Patoku, until it reaches the Bay of Vlor√´. Numerous rivers flowing into the Adriatic Sea form bays, lagoons and limans. The sand and silt they bring are deposited in the areas of reduced flow, that is the sides of the bays, forming narrow sandbanks.  Biodiversity  In terms of phytogeography, the Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast belongs to the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. It falls entirely within the Illyrian deciduous forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. The special environmental circumstances and the millennial human activity on the territory of the coast determine the rich variety of species, populations and ecosystems, many of which are with conservation significance. The Albanian Adriatic portion features contrasting vegetation types that are impacted by different factors. The woodlands are mostly dominated by evergreen forests with associated broadleaved sclerophyllous evergreen trees and shrubs primarily found in the southern section of the coastline. The forests ranges from mixed broadleaf forests, at lower elevations, to conifer forests, at higher elevations. The pine forms an important natural feature within the coastline, distributed across Velipoja, Sh√´ngjin, Patok and Rodon, which in turn provide habitat for a vast array of wildlife. Stretching in the southeastern Adriatic Sea, the coast with a wealth of important habitats makes for a fascinating birdwatching location during peak migration with several wetlands, estuaries and hills provides diversity for both resident and migrant birds. Maybe the most iconic bird of the coast is the vulnerable and extremely rare dalmatian pelican. It breeds on inland lakes and coastal lagoons of Albania such as in Karavasta and Patoku Lagoon. The greater flamingo is another prominent and important species that live in the region. It is the largest species of flamingos and widespread in Karavasta and Narta Lagoon. The coast is famous for wildlife watching and nesting sea turtles are one of the region's highlights. Its beaches provide nesting sites for several species of endangered sea turtles, namely the hawksbill, leatherback, green sea and loggerhead sea turtle. As well as turtles, the sea life consist of several species of sharks, dolphins and whales. The cuvier's beaked whale and sperm whale are common along the coast. The dolphin species found along the entire coastline are represented by the striped dolphin, risso's dolphin and common bottlenose dolphin. Coastal protected areas near Shengjin and Lezhe The vast and diverse coast is home to an incredibly rich diversity of mammals. Most famous of the carnivores is the rare golden jackal that occurs mostly on the coast of the ravines of the rivers. Another notorious might be the red fox, which occurs throughout the forested and coastal areas in the northern section of the coast. Other mammals include the brown bear, wild boar, chamois and grey wolf. The sea, lagoons and river deltas are extremely rich in salt and fresh water fish. Some aquatic and abundant animals include the european sea sturgeon, starry sturgeon, twait shad and adriatic sturgeon, which is perhaps the most famous species to become extinct in the Adriatic Sea. catchment area of Drin is classified as one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in Europe. The protected areas of Albania are a biodiversity treasure, containing a wide range of geographical and climatic diversity. Different categories of protected areas have been established alongside the coast. Divjak√´-Karavasta National Park, the only national park in the Albanian Adriatic coast, is very picturesque and harbors several endangered species, that makes it a very popular place indeed. Encompassing the Drin River estuary, the Kun√´-Vain-Tale Nature Park is an undisturbed natural area of wet grasslands, swamps and lagoons at the direct proximity to the Adriatic Sea. The Vjosa, considered to be Europe's last wild river, discharges, north of Narta, into the Adriatic Sea, where it forms the Vjosa-Narta Protected Landscape. Both the Karavasta Lagoon and Lake Shkod√´r are classified as wetlands of international importance by designation under the Ramsar Convention. Important Bird Areas are important sites for bird conservation and their habitats, as they provide suitable conditions to birds. Currently, 16 important bird areas have been identified throughout the territory of Albania, amongst them the Drin Delta near Shkod√´r, the Vlor√´ Bay, that is bordered by Karaburun-Sazan Marine Park, and the lagoons of Patoku, Karavasta and Narta, that are among the largest and most important coastal wetlands of the Balkans, due to its varied biodiversity and one of the top sites for wintering and migratory birds in the country.  Climate  Apart from the considerable variation in landscape, it makes for a wide range of climate types. The Adriatic Sea in the west, Albanian Alps in the north and Ceraunian Mountains in the south have a great influence to the climate of the area. As defined by the K√∂ppen climate classification, the Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast experiences a mediterranean climate with considerable maritime and subtropical influences. This means that the summers are hot, sometimes very hot and dry and the winters generally mild and wet. The coast experiences four distinct seasons. The winter is relatively humid and mild, and the summer lasts very long and is usually hot and dry. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. Winds in the Adriatic Sea change their direction and speed during a year period as a result of the distinctive mediterranean climate. This characteristic is mainly determined by a passing trajectory of basic systems across the Mediterranean Sea and Balkan Peninsula as well as other important factors such as morphometric characteristics of the territory.  Economy   Tourism  Apollonia attracts hundreds of tourists. Tourism is considered one of the largest industries in the economy of Albania. It has significantly increased since following the fall of communism in the country. The country has a rich historical and cultural heritage and natural beauty varying from clear turquoise waters fringed by sandy and rocky beaches to contrasting mountainous interior. The coastline has a well-preserved natural ecosystem that can boast a unique combination of a diverse climate and landscape. As Albania extends over the Adriatic flyway, birdwatching is recently gaining in popularity, due to the interest shown by visitors from other countries. The coastline has a lot to offer fr both visiting and resident bird watchers. The extensive wetlands, with many different Mediterranean and European species, contains many significant birding sites throughout the year. The lagoons in Karavasta, Patoku, Narta and various other protected areas are just a few examples of popular birdwatching destinations. Golem beach south of Durr√´s is a popular summer retreat Beach vacations, particularly for domestic and foreign visitors from different countries, are also central to the local tourism industry. Most beach resorts are located especially along the coastline of Durr√´s and Vlor√´. The southern coastline of Durr√´s are renowned for its traditional mass tourism, which have experienced an uncontrolled urban development. In contrast, the northern coastline are mostly unspoiled and set to become an elite tourism destination. In addition, the area is gaining international attention through the organization of music festivals such as the UNUM International Music Festival in Rana e Hedhun, Shengjin. The heritage tourism is focussed on specific interest on the history of Albania, such as the architectural heritage of ancient civilizations such as the Illyrians, Ancient Greeks and Romans in Albania. Besides the churches, mosques, forts and historical buildings, the most popular heritage tourism attractions are the remains of the ancient city of Apollonia, the ancient fortress of Rozafa and the amphitheatre of Durr√´s.  Transport  Panorama of the Port of Durr√´s. The Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast is home to the three largest seaports of the country. The largest cargo ports among them is the Port of Durr√´s, one of the largest in the Adriatic Sea, with annual passenger volume of approximately 1.5 million. The other seaports include Vlor√´ and Sh√´ngjin. In addition, the ports serve a wide system of ferries, connecting numerous islands and coastal cities in addition to ferry lines to several cities in Croatia, Greece and Italy. Yachting is pretty recent in the country and less developed than in other countries within the Mediterranean Sea. Porto Albania will be after its complementation, the first marina destination in Albania for both national and international yachting and charter. It will be located between the city of Durr√´s and the national park of Divjak√´-Karavasta.

He described the pottery as usually round-bottomed bowls, which were normally smooth, thin-walled and hard, usually dark brown and sometimes with a profile at the shoulder or area of the mouth. Pottery of the Ballymarlagh Style Four subgroups were recognised in Ireland: * Dunmurry style, * Ballymarlagh style * Limerick style I (round bottomed) * Limerick style II (shallow/flat) * Lyles Hill style. Over the course of time they were increasingly decorated. Simple incised patterns on the shoulder created with a piece of wood may possibly represent a leather case. Pots decorated with cord patterns are so typical of Ireland that they became known as Ballyalton Bowls, named after the court tomb where they were found. Similar pots were found in the west of Scotland in graves. There were referred to there as Beacharra ware.Style of decorated middle Neolithic pottery found in western parts of Scotland and classified by Stuart Piggott into three groups: * A = unornamented bag-shaped bowls; * B =decorated carinated bowls with a rim diameter less than the diameter at the carination and incised or channelled ornament; * C = small bowls with panel ornament in fine whipped cord.

Created by writer Jonathan Hickman and artist Tomm Coker, the book combines elements of noir fiction, horror, and mystery.  Plot  The series takes place in the aftermath of Black Monday, the stock market crash of 1987. The story concerns a group of elite financiers who have made a blood pact with a god, in exchange for power and wealth. A second narrative strand follows NYC detective Theodore Dumas, as he unravels the secrets at the heart of the global financial market. According to Hickman, \\"This is a book about schools of magic. The only difference being that instead of schools of magic, it's financial institutions. Power is accumulated through wealth. It's about a bunch of guys, a bunch of schools, that gathered together and generated a financial collapse in order to attain power\\".  Reception  Reviewing the first issue, IGN's Jesse Schedeen called it \\"another worthwhile addition to the Jonathan Hickman canon\\", praising its denseness and tone, while also mentioning that these elements might also make it somewhat unapproachable for first time readers of Hickman's work.

In traditional fiqh, it means a contract for the hiring of persons or renting/leasing of the services or the ‚Äúusufruct‚Äù of a property, generally for a fixed period and price. In hiring, the employer is called musta‚Äôjir, while the employee is called ajir. Ijarah need not lead to purchase. In conventional leasing an \\"operating lease\\" does not end in a change of ownership, nor does the type of ijarah known as al-ijarah (tashghiliyah). In Islamic finance, al Ijarah does lead to purchase (Ijara wa Iqtina, or \\"rent and acquisition\\") and usually refers to a leasing contract of property (such as land, plant, office automation, a motor vehicle), which is leased to a client for stream of rental and purchase payments, ending with a transfer of ownership to the lessee, and otherwise follows Islamic regulations. Rules Islamic finance theorist Muhammad Taqi Usmani lists seventeen \\"Basic Rules of Leasing\\" (leasing referring to Islamic leasing which Usmani uses interchangeably with ijarah) in his work Islamic Finance: Principles and Practice ‚Äî although \\"the principles of ijarah are so numerous that a separate volume is required for their full discussion\\".Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p.111-113 Some of the rules include agreeing on the cost of the lease and the period of time for which it will last; clear terms in the contract; agreeing on purpose the lessee will use the property for, which they must stick to; the lessor (owner of the leased property) agreeing to bear all the \\"liabilities emerging from the ownership\\", etc. Usmani lists eleven \\"basic differences between the contemporary financial leasing\\" and \\"leasing allowed by the Shari‚Äòah\\".Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p.114-124 Faleel Jamaldeen lists three features of ijarah that distinguish it from conventional leasing: * The lessor must own the asset being leased for the entire period of the lease. * No compound interest may be charged if the lessee delays or defaults on payment. * Use of the asset being leased must be specified in the contract. Types of Ijarah There are several types of ijarah: Ijarah thumma al bai' (hire purchase) In this transaction (hire purchase or Lease-Sale or Financial Lease) the customer leases (hires) a good and agrees to purchase it, paying in installments so that by the end of the lease it owns the good free and clear. This involves two contracts: # an Ijarah that outlines the terms for leasing or renting over a fixed period; # a Bai that triggers a sale to be completed by the end of the term of the Ijarah. One Islamic Bank (Devon Bank) describes the process as follows > An ijarah transaction involves two components: a purchase agreement and a > lease. You go out and find the property you would like us to purchase on > your behalf. You negotiate the price and other aspects of the purchase. You > make any initial payment of earnest money to reserve the property. You make > sure that the purchase contract allows [the] Bank to step into the > transaction as the buyer. The Bank then buys the property. At the closing, > the Bank enters into an agreement to sell the property to you for a fixed > price-the purchase price the Bank paid plus any transaction costs not paid > by you at the closing. Ownership of the property is transferred to you after > this price has been paid to the Bank. A payment schedule is established so > that in exchange for keeping the property rented, your payments are deferred > over time. The buyer's installment payments will remain the same (or fairly close to the same) through the contract, but the portion of the payment going towards ownership of the property will increase to 100% over time as the portion going to pay rent/lease decreases to 0% ‚Äî the decrease in rent/lease reflecting the decrease in the bank's equity of the property as the buyer's increases (much like the interest portion of a conventional mortgage payment declines to zero and the equity payment increases to 100% over time). (This type of transaction is similar to the contractum trinius, a technique used by European bankers and merchants during the Middle Ages to comply with the letter of the Church's prohibition on interest bearing loans. In a contractum, two parties would enter into three (trinius) concurrent and interrelated legal contracts, the net effect being the paying of a fee for the use of money for the term of the loan. The use of concurrent interrelated contracts is also prohibited under Shariah Law.) As of around 2013 there were 15 banks in Malaysia that offered this mode of finance (sometimes abbreviated as AITAB) for \\"individual and corporate customers\\". Ijarah wa-iqtina (or al-ijarah muntahia bitamleek) Ijarah wa-iqtina (literally, \\"lease and ownership\\") is also called al ijarah muntahia bitamleek (\\"lease that ends with ownership\\"). Like a ijara thumma bay\`, it may involve both a lease contract and a sale contract. However, in an ijara wa iqtina contract the transfer of ownership occurs as soon as the lessee pays the purchase price of the asset ‚Äî anytime during the leasing period. Another source describes the difference between ijara muntahia bittamleek and ijara thumma bay\` as that in ijara muntahia bittamleek sale/ownership transfer is \\"an option given to the lessee\\". In ijara thumma bay\` sale is part of the contract. An Islamically correct ijara wa iqtina contract \\"rests\\" on three conditions: # The lease and the transfer of ownership of the asset or the property should be recorded in separate documents. # The agreement to transfer of ownership should not be a pre- condition to the signing of the leasing contract. # The ‚Äúpromise‚Äù to transfer the ownership should be unilateral and should be binding only on the lessor. Another source (investment-and-finance.net) describes Ijarah muntahia bittamleek as being though # hibah (gift), where legal title is transferred to the lessee without any more payments, and which according to investment-and- finance.net \\"is widely used by Islamic banks.\\" # or through sales. Ijarah muntahia bittamleek through sales may be of three types: ::a) where there is a gradual transfer of legal title of the leased property during the leasing \\"tenor\\" (period of time of the lease). ::b) where the legal title is transferred at the end of lease tenor for \\"a token consideration\\". ::c) where ownership is transferred before the end of the lease tenor for a price equivalent to the remaining ijarah installments (net of rental).  ijara mawsoofa bi al dhimma  In a \\"forward ijarah\\" or ijara mawsoofa bi al dhimma Islamic contract, (literally \\"lease described with responsibility\\", also transliterated ijara mawsufa bi al thimma), the service or benefit being leased is well-defined, but the particular unit providing that service or benefit is not identified. Thus, if a unit providing the service or benefit is destroyed, the contract is not void. In contemporary Islamic finance, ijara mawsoofa bi al dhimma is the leasing of something (such as a home, office, or factory) not yet produced or constructed. This means the ijara mawsoofa bi al dhimma contract is combined with a Istisna contract for construction of whatever it is that will provide the service or benefit.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012:158 The financer finances its making, while the party begins leasing the asset after \\"taking delivery\\" of it. While forward sales normally do not comply with sharia, it is allowed using ijarah provided rent/lease payment do not begin until after the customer takes delivery. Also required by sharia is that the asset be clearly specified, its rental rate be clearly set (although the rate may float based on the agreement of both parties). Challenges According to M.T. Usmani, \\"some requirements of Shari‚Äòah are often overlooked\\" in transactions of ijarah in the real world, as when an unforeseeable circumstance leads to the destruction of the asset but the lessee is required to keep paying the rent in violation of the principle that the lessor assumes the liability for his ownership and offers any usufruct to the lessee.Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p.167 Other challenges are not of failure to follow sharia law properly in practice but of disadvantages in cost or consumer protection ijarah has compared to conventional finance. Mahmud el-Gamal notes the added expense of the bank/financer having to \\"maintain substantial ownership of the property throughout the lease period\\" compared to financial leases used by conventional finance.El-Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p.14 Another problem is that the ijarah customer may be \\"exposed to the risk of losing the property if the financier is sued, loses, and declares bankruptcy\\" even if the customer has paid off 90% of the property price. A workaround (with additional cost) is to establish \\"bankruptcy-remote\\" Special-purpose entitys to hold title to the property and \\"serve as parties to various agreements regarding obligations for repairs and insurance\\". Abu Umar Faruq Ahmad writes in Theory and Practice of Modern Islamic Finance: The Case Analysis from Australia that at least in that country the lessee of Ijarah wa Iqtina house purchase is in a weaker legal position than the payer of a conventional mortgage. Firstly, the Ijarah wa Iqtina lessor/lender can evict the borrower/buyer who is \\"a few months in arrears\\" because the borrower is a tenant not an owner. In contrast the conventional borrower/buyer/mortgagor cannot because they have \\"security of tenure\\". Secondly if the Lender/mortgagee in a conventional mortgage does foreclose on the buyer and re-sell the property, they are \\"obliged by law to secure the best possible price\\" and to make available, \\"a full account\\" of the resale transactions to the foreclosed borrower. In a Ijarah wa Iqtina contract the lessor/lender has \\"no such obligation\\" to the lessee. Muhammad Akram Khan criticizes ijara's customer protection vis-√†-vis conventional interest-bearing loans in an example: > Suppose, for example, a person takes a five-year interest-bearing loan to > buy a car. After two years, if he finds that keeping the car and the loan is > uneconomical, he can sell the car in the market and repay the loan. This is > not so in the case of ijara. Ijara finance cannot be terminated > prematurely.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.349 References Notes Citations Books, documents, journal articles     External links * Ijara as an Islamic Finance Method Islamic financial contracts Islamic banking Islamic banking and finance terminology Credit Banking terms ","title":"Ijarah"},{"id":"55418452","text":"Diogenes heteropsammicola is a species of hermit crab discovered during samplings between 2012 and 2016 in the shallow waters of the Japanese Amami Islands.

Description Tliltocatl verdezi is small for a member of the genus. The male has a total body length of about 30 mm. The fourth leg is the longest, at about 55 mm. The male's body is very dark, almost completely black, with red and orange hair on the upper surface of the abdomen and on the legs. The female has a slightly lighter cephalothorax with a dark triangle at the front. The male has two apophyses (projections) on the tibia of the first leg, the smaller of which has a spine on the inside. Taxonomy Prior to 2003, there was confusion over the identity of Tliltocatl verdezi. Some spiders in captivity were called \\"Aphonopelma pallidum\\" or \\"Brachypelma pallidum\\". In 1994, Andrew Smith reported that the male and female preserved specimens that had been used to describe a species under the name \\"pallidum\\" actually belonged to two different species, collected more than 1,050 km apart. The males are now treated as Aphonopelma pallidum, the females as Brachypelma albiceps. The spiders in captivity given the name pallidum appeared to belong to neither of these species ‚Äì for one thing they were very dark in colour, whereas in Latin pallidum means 'pale'. A specimen received by tarantula keeper Heinz-Josef Peters under the name \\"Aphonopelma pallidum\\" was sent to G√ºnter Schmidt for study. Schmidt determined that it was a new species, which he named Brachypelma verdezi. The specific name refers to J.-M. Verdez, who was one of the first to realize that these spiders were being incorrectly named. In November 2019, it was proposed that Brachypelma verdezi be moved to the genus Tliltocatl; this has been accepted by the World Spider Catalog. Distribution The distribution of Tliltocatl verdezi within Mexico is Southern Guerrero and into eastern Oaxaca. Ray Gabriel and Stuart Longhorn in 2015 gave the location of a female collected by Arturo Locht in Mexico as Acapulco, i.e. on the Pacific coast. This seemed to contradict the original description Gunter Schmidt who stated that the \\"locus typicus\\" is further north and inland than had been reported previously by Locht et al. 1999. by a map indicating south-central Guerrero. However, Schmidt merely went on to define the type locality very poorly as \\"an unspecified area south of Toluca, Guerrero (Mexico)\\". Elsewhere he refers to field collected information by Peter Klaas that the \\"species could occur in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Oaxaca\\" and who gave detailed their lifestyle in nature. This issue was much later discussed by Longhorn 2014, who clarified that Schmidt was notorious for vague or incorrect locality information, and referring to other published information at the time clearly indicating the stock origins as \\"Acapulco, Guerrero\\". Fieldwork by various parties have repeatedly found the same species Tliltocatl verdezi in this coastal zone and north into Central Guerrero, but none have been reported as found anywhere near \\"Toluca\\", only much further south. The precise type locality remains unknown, but its natural distribution is now clear. Conservation All species of Brachypelma, then including Tliltocatl, were placed on CITES Appendix II in 1994, thus restricting trade.

He was educated in the public and private schools of Hartford, Connecticut, and New York City. At the age of sixteen, in 1882, he began his business career with an electrical contractor. He remained in this position from August, 1884, until February, 1885, when he became an employee of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of New York, which was succeeded by the New York Edison Company. At Edison, Williams was assigned to duty as assistant in the chemical meter department. From this period his advancement was rapid, due to his speedy grasp of conditions and the energy he displayed. He was made superintendent of interior construction in 1887, and was electrician of the company until 1888, when he was advanced to the position of superintendent of the underground department, general inspector in 1890 and general agent in 1893.

Adherents of the exiled House of Stuart were known as 'Jacobites', from Jacobus, Latin for James, and the associated political movement as Jacobitism. Part of the wider European conflict known as the Nine Years War, the Scottish rising was launched in support of the 1689 to 1691 Williamite War in Ireland. Despite victory at Killiecrankie in July 1689, the death of Jacobite leader John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee and lack of supplies limited the Scottish rising. Major military action ended in May 1690, although the Highlands were not finally subdued until February 1692, ending with the Massacre of Glencoe. It was the first of a series of Jacobite rebellions and plots which continued until the mid 18th century. Background In February 1685, the Catholic James II & VII came to power with widespread support in all three kingdoms. In predominately Catholic Ireland, it was hoped he would reverse land confiscations and restrictions on their ability to hold office. While overwhelmingly Protestant, the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms meant many in both England and Scotland feared the consequences of bypassing the 'natural heir'. A desire for stability led to the rapid collapse of two Protestant risings in June 1685, the Monmouth Rebellion in England, and Argyll's Rising in Scotland. James II & VII The 1681 Scottish Succession and Test Acts made obedience to the monarch a legal obligation, 'regardless of religion'; in return, James swore to uphold the primacy of the Church of Scotland or kirk. By 1680, over 95 percent of Scots were members of the kirk; Catholics numbered less than 2% of the population and even other Protestant sects were barred. Attempts to repeal the Scottish Test Act undermined his moderate supporters, while rewarding the dissident Presbyterians who backed Argyll in 1685. The perception James was willing to ignore his commitments, his Coronation Oath and his own supporters seriously undermined his position in Scotland. In October 1685, an estimated 200,000 French Protestants were forced into exile by the Edict of Fontainebleau, while French expansion under Louis XIV threatened the Protestant Dutch Republic. Close economic and cultural ties between Scotland and fellow Calvinists in France and Holland exacerbated fears Protestant Europe was threatened by a Catholic counter-reformation. In June 1688, two events turned dissent into a crisis. The first was the birth of James Francis Edward on 10 June, creating the prospect of a Catholic dynasty, rather than James being succeeded by his Protestant daughter Mary, and her husband William of Orange. The second was prosecution of the Seven Bishops, which seemed to go beyond tolerance for Catholicism into an assault on the Church of England. This appeared to also threaten the kirk, and their acquittal on 30 June destroyed James' political authority in both Scotland and England. Prior to 1685, many feared civil war if James were bypassed; by 1688, it seemed only his removal could prevent one. War with France appeared imminent, making William anxious to secure English resources; in July, he received assurances of support for armed intervention from across the English political class, including those who had previously supported James. The Nine Years War began in September and on 5 November, William landed in Brixham with 14,000 men; as he advanced, much of the Royal Army deserted and James went into exile on 23 December. In February, the Parliament of England made William and Mary joint monarchs of England. The Scottish Convention George Melville, 1st Earl of Melville, government leader in Parliament In March 1689, elections were held for a Scottish Convention to agree a settlement. Many of William's advisors were Scottish exiles like Argyll and Melville, who wanted to expel bishops from the kirk. When the Convention assembled in March, the 125 delegates were split roughly 75:50 between Presbyterians and Episcopalians; only a tiny minority were loyal to James, the real debate being control of the kirk and the limits of Royal authority. On 12 March, James landed in Ireland; he sent the Convention a letter, which was read out on 16 March, demanding obedience and threatening punishment for non-compliance. Public anger meant some Episcopalians stopped attending meetings, claiming to fear for their safety, while others changed sides. In addition, the Catholic Duke of Gordon held Edinburgh Castle for James, while his former military commander Viscount Dundee began recruiting troops. The effect was to bolster the Presbyterian majority in the Convention, which met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops. On 11 April, the Convention ended James' reign and adopted the Articles of Grievances and the Claim of Right Act that made Parliament the primary legislative power in Scotland. On 11 May 1689, William and Mary accepted the Scottish throne and the Convention became a full Parliament on 5 June. Jacobite rising Dundee's rising was designed to complement the war in Ireland and relied on support from Ulster. The government commander in Scotland was Hugh Mackay, an experienced soldier with around 3,500 troops, including 1,100 men from the veteran Dutch Scots Brigade. Ewen Cameron of Lochiel assembled some 1,800 Highland levies at Glenroy; Dundee joined him with around 40 companions and on 18 May, marched out in an attempt to bring Mackay to battle. Aware of the short-term nature of Highland warfare, Mackay avoided combat; when Dundee returned to Glenroy in late June, most of the clansmen went home, leaving him with less than 200 men. His position was weakened by defections, Gordon surrendered Edinburgh Castle on 14 June, while Jacobite retreat in Ulster made resupply extremely difficult. The only reinforcements received were a contingent of 300 Irish soldiers under Alexander Cannon, who landed near Duart on 21 July. Before returning to Glenroy, Dundee installed a Jacobite garrison at Blair Castle, a strategic point which controlled access to the Scottish Lowlands. Home to the Marquess of Atholl, this shows how many tried to balance both sides. Atholl left for Bath, Somerset claiming ill-health, while his eldest son John Murray 'besieged' his ancestral home on behalf of the government. He was careful not to damage it, while its garrison was commanded by Patrick Stewart of Ballechin, a trusted Atholl family retainer. When reinforcements led by Dundee arrived at Blair on 25 July, Murray withdrew, while Mackay left Perth with around 3,500 men and moved north to support him. At Killiecrankie on 27 July, the Jacobites won a resounding victory, inflicting nearly 2,000 casualties on Mackay's army. However, nearly a third of the Jacobites were killed, including Dundee. Alexander Cannon took over as Jacobite leader, but his options were limited. Without siege equipment, he could not capture a port, making resupply almost impossible, while lack of cavalry made Jacobite soldiers vulnerable in the open. Time was on Mackay's side, so long as he avoided another ambush. Jacobite leader Dundee, killed at Killiecrankie After an assault on Dunkeld in August was repulsed with heavy losses, Cannon ended the campaign for the year, and his army dispersed. Mackay spent the winter reducing Jacobite strongholds and constructing a new base at Fort William, while harsh weather conditions led to severe food shortages. Thomas Buchan replaced Cannon in February 1690, but could only mobilise some 800 men; he was taken by surprise at Cromdale in May and his forces scattered. Mackay pursued Buchan into Aberdeenshire, preventing him from establishing a secure base. In November 1690, Mackay relinquished command to Thomas Livingstone. Anxious to re-allocate resources to the war against France, in March 1690, Lord Stair offered the Jacobite chiefs ¬£12,000 for swearing allegiance to William. They finally agreed to do so in the June 1691 Declaration of Achallader, although the war did not formally end until the Glencoe massacre in February 1692. Cannon and Buchan had been sheltered in the Highlands by Glengarry, and as part of the deal that ended the Rising received safe conduct to France in March 1692. Aftermath Although William wanted to retain bishops, the Rising highlighted his reliance on Presbyterian support. In an attempt to preserve Episcopalianism, the Scottish bishops proposed Union with England, which was rejected by the English Parliament. In October 1690, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met for the first time since 1653; the 1690 Settlement eliminated episcopacy and created two commissions for the south and north of the Tay, which over the next 25 years removed almost two-thirds of all ministers. Acts of indulgence in 1693 and 1695 allowed many of these to return to the kirk, with others protected by the local gentry, such as Michael Fraser, minister at Daviot and Dunlichty. First appointed in 1673, he was still in office when he died in 1726, despite being evicted in 1694, as well as joining the 1715 and 1719 Jacobite Risings. However, a significant element of the Scottish political class remained outside the kirk, eventually forming the Scottish Episcopal Church, which was officially sanctioned in 1711. Particularly strong in Aberdeenshire and Perthshire, it would be a major source of Jacobite support in subsequent risings.

Designed by Augustus Pugin, it was his only known church building in that city. Construction of St Wilfrid's began in 1839 and the church building was completed in 1842, although a planned tower was never built. The church served a small number of Irish people who lived in the area. In July 1852, during a period of anti-Catholic demonstrations, the building was mistakenly rumoured to be the target of Protestant people who desired to burn it down. There had been sectarian riots in nearby Stockport in the previous month and the heightened tensions led to a fight in a pub becoming misconstrued as an imminent attack on the church. A large mob of Irish people arrived to defend the building against this non-existent threat and, although the priest, Reverend Toole, attempted to calm them and urged them to disperse, for several days afterwards a group of people stood watch over it. The church had the services of Irish priests from County Kerry continuously from the 1890s until the 1930s. St Wilfrid's became a Grade II listed building in December 1963. Facing declining enrollment, the parish was suppressed and the church was deconsecrated in 1990. The church was converted into a factory that manufactured beds and in 1994 became an enterprise centre. Among those buried at the church was William Bally, a Swiss sculptor and phrenologist.

It was built sometime between 1934 and 1936, and is one of a large number of surviving stone bridges built as part of federal jobs programs in the county. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 as Bridge No. 63-137-090-Parker. Description and history Bridge No. 63-137-090 is located in north central Turner County, a rural county in eastern South Dakota. It is located on 277th Street, about south of Parker, between 453rd and 454th Avenues. It is a two-arch stone structure, about long, built out of crudely worked fieldstone, predominantly granite. Each arch is about long, with a rise of above that width. It has flared and sloping wing walls, which rise slightly above the road level to form low parapets. This bridge is one of 65 stone bridges built in Turner County as part of a New Deal-era federal jobs program. The county administration was able to build stone bridges at a lower cost than then-conventional steel beam bridges because of the availability of experienced stone workers, and the federal subsidy to the wages they were paid. The county was responsible for supervising the work crews and providing the building materials. This bridge was built by a county crew, sometime between 1934 and 1936 (records have not survived for an exact construction date).

Its name in English translates as 'Small Fort'; or alternatively 'Little Fortress'. It is situated on the Eastern slopes of Tal-y-Fan, an outlying peak of the Carneddau mountain range in northeast Snowdonia; at an altitude of approximately 413 metres (1,355 feet). Little information is known about the history of the fort, as to date, the site has undergone minimal investigation. The fort is classed as a scheduled ancient monument and is of national importance for its potential to enhance our knowledge of prehistoric settlement. It is said to retain significant archaeological potential, with a strong probability of the presence of associated archaeological features and deposits.  Description  Remains of a stone wall at Caer Bach, looking NW towards the Eastern slopes of Tal-y-Fan.\\"Caer Bach, a small hill-fort at about 1,300ft above O.D. The end of a spur projecting E. from Tal y Fan rises slightly to form a rounded hillock, which is encircled by two roughly circular lines of defence. The outer is a bank of earth with an external ditch, which survives to a total height of about 10ft. A stone revetment of laid masonry can be traced on the N.W. outer face, and a slight counterscarp bank on the S. The E. side merges into the natural slope. Separated from this rampart by about 50ft. are the footings of a stone wall, much robbed, about 12‚Äì15 feet thick, built in short straight lengths. The facing, where it survives, is generally of large blocks set on their longer edges. There entrances through both ramparts were on the S.E., but are much ruined. A hut circle and be traced against the inner face of the N.W. side of the inner enclosure.\\" The site has been identified as a partial contour fort, unusual for its poorly defensible position within the wider landscape, and also for its small size. The fort has broad views over the Conwy valley and it has been speculated that its position is related to a prehistoric trackway, which ran from the mouth of the River Conwy, through to the mountain pass at Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen. Minimal investigations into the site mean that no dating evidence has been made available.  The wider landscape  Thirty yards southwest of the fort are the remains of a round hut, about 24 feet in diameter and cut into the slope on the northeast and dating from the Iron Age / Roman period (Grid ref: SH74377292). Plan of Caer Bach. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales also notes the remnants of three Bronze Age cairns to the south-west of the fort.http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/303085/details/cairns-eslope-of-tal-y- fan-4 The cairns are described as surviving in 'very poor' condition, being 'circular mounds of earth and stones', the tallest of which rises 1 foot, 6 inches above the ground, with a diameter of 18 feet. (Grid ref: SH74297259)  Access  Defensive ditch running along the NE boundary of Caer Bach. The fort is in quite a remote, hilly area; and access necessarily involves at least a little walking over some uneven, upland terrain. The quickest route is to drive up to Llangelynin church via a narrow road that leads through Henryd, utilise the small car park and make your way on foot to the fort, using the public footpath which forms a small part of the North Wales Pilgrim's Way as it runs West past the church, before bearing South towards the fort. The church is not named on the Ordnance Survey map, but lies at reference SH751737. An alternate route by car, is to park in the public car park at Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen and follow the line of the old Roman road past Cae Coch farm, before leaving the track to take the public footpath which runs in a north- easterly direction, and leads directly to the fort. This route will take you very near to the Bronze Age burial chamber, 'Maen-y-Bardd' (see link below for further details). Public footpaths converge on the site from all directions. The fort itself sits near the South-Eastern border of a large area of Open Access land, designated 'Open Common', the extent (and limitations) of which can be found here.

Through his banking activities, he played a significant role in the early years of the Standard Oil company. He was also one of the founding investors in the Cleveland Rolling Mill, a major steel firm in the United States. Early life Witt was born January 4, 1808, in Worcester, Massachusetts, to John and Hannah ( Foster) Witt. His family was poor, and he had little education. The Witts moved to Troy, New York, when Stillman was 13 years old. John Witt ran a tavern on the halfway point between Troy and Albany, New York. Stillman obtained a job earning $10 a month paddling a skiff ferry across the Hudson River. Canvass White, an engineer and inventor, frequently rode the ferry, and became impressed with Stillman's attentiveness, attitude, and drive. After obtaining John Witt's permission, White apprenticed the boy as an engineer and accountant. To augment his apprenticeship, he took lessons at night in accounting and bookkeeping. Early career Canvass White, the engineer who apprenticed Stillman Witt at the age of 13 and changed his life. About 1826, White sent Witt to work for the Cohoes Company in Cohoes, New York. White and others founded the firm in 1826. In 1831, the Cohoes Company built a wooden dam across the Mohawk River above Cohoes Falls and later would construct six canals to provide hydropower to various mills, factories, and foundries in Cohoes. Witt went to work as paymaster for the Cohoes Company, although the date of his arrival is not known. Some sources claim that Witt helped to construct the dam and the six power canals, as well as platted the emerging village of Cohoes. If he did so, then it was under the supervision of Hugh White, the brother of Canvass (who had assumed construction supervisory duties, as Canvass White was too busy). Canvass White turned over operation of the Cohoes Company to Hugh White in 1830, before work on the dam began. Canvass White died in 1834, before work on the power canals began. Witt then went to work as a paymaster and engineer for the Juniata Bridge Company on the Clark's Ferry Bridge in Duncannon, Pennsylvania. Work began on the bridge, which spanned the Juniata River just before its confluence with the Susquehanna River, in 1939 and was completed later that year. Unclear work history Witt then traveled to Kentucky, where he was to work on the Louisville and Portland Canal. Sources vary considerably as to the next sequence of events. Two sources say Witt spent 18 months there, but did not finish the work and so returned to Albany. Maurice Joblin, however, says he fell ill shortly after arriving in Kentucky, and returned to Albany for 13 months of recuperation. The New York Times said Witt completed work on the canal (although it did not say how long that took) and then returned to Albany. If Witt worked on the canal, it seems unlikely that he spent much time there. The canal had been completed in December 1830, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers records almost no work done on the canal between 1830 and 1848 (when Witt is known to have been in Cleveland). The next sequence of events is even cloudier. According to business biographer James W. Campbell, Witt next became an agent for the Hudson River Steamboat Association. Railway Age claimed he was a manager, while The New York Times said he went to work for the People's Line. Joblin, however, says that Witt first captained the James Farley, a steamboat on the Erie Canal, for an unspecified period of time. Witt then captained the Hudson River steamboat Novelty for two or three years, before being hired as a manager by the Hudson River Steamboat Association. Joblin claims he remained with the group until it dissolved in 1841. Early railroading About 1840 or 1841, Witt took a managerial position with the Western Railroad. Witt's position has been variously reported as \\"general manager\\", \\"manager\\", \\"general freight agent\\", and \\"agent\\". The Western Railroad itself referred to Witt as a \\"superintendent\\" in April 1842, and as an \\"agent\\" in 1849. Whatever the scope of his duties, sources agree that Witt was stationed at Albany, and during his tenure oversaw the construction of the depot at East Greenbush (now a suburb of Albany). According to Joblin, Witt spent seven-and-a-half years working for the railroad. Career in Cleveland Cleveland, Columbus & Cincinnati Railroad Amasa Stone. Along with Frederick Harbach, he and Witt made their fortunes building railroads in Ohio. By the late 1840s, Stillman Witt was well known as a manager and railroad builder. From 1840 to 1843, Frederick Harbach had worked as an assistant engineer on the Western Railroad, and the two men became acquainted. Witt also worked with Amasa Stone, who at that time was active constructing railroad bridges throughout New England. Stone, too, became acquainted with Harbach. The three men became involved with the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad (CC&C;). The CC&C; was chartered in 1836, but for various reasons did not begin construction on the road for more than a decade. In 1847, Harbach left Massachusetts to accept an appointment at the CC&C; as chief surveyor of the road. In November 1848, the company finally issued a request for proposals to build the first leg of its line from Cleveland to Columbus, Ohio. Alfred Kelley, an attorney and former state legislator, canal commissioner, banker, and railroad builder, was president of the railway, and he, too, knew Stone well from his railroading days in the east. Kelley and the CC&C; managers reached out to Harbach, Stone, and Witt, and asked them to bid on the project. The three men formed a company in late 1848 to bid on the contract, which they then won. Construction began on the line in November 1849, and the final spike was driven on February 18, 1851. Harbach, Stone, and Witt agreed to take a portion of their pay in the form of stock in the railroad. The stock soared in value as soon as the spur was completed, making the three men very wealthy. Witt was first named a director of the CC&C; in 1856, a position he held until 1868.; ; ; ; He was elected vice president of the firm as well in June 1863, a position he also held until 1868. On May 16, 1868, the CC&C; merged with the Bellefontaine Railway to form the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway (CCC&I;). Witt was elected a director and vice president of the new company, a position he held until his death in 1875.; ; ; Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad Witt next became involved with the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad (CP&A;). On February 18, 1848, the CP&A; received a state charter to build a line from Cleveland to join the Franklin Canal Railroad, whose line ran from Erie, Pennsylvania, to the Ohio border. Alfred Kelley was a director of the CP&A;, and on July 26, 1850, the CP&A; awarded a contract to build its line to the firm of Harbach, Stone, and Witt. The line was completed in autumn 1852. Once more Witt and his partners took a large portion of their pay in the form of stock, which made them very rich. Witt was first elected a director of the CP&A; in 1853, a position he held until 1869.; He was elected vice president of the company as well in 1859, and held that position 1868.; ; ; ; ; The CP&A; had a close working relationship with the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railway, and in 1860 Witt was elected to the Michigan Southern's board of directors. He held this position at least through 1864. The CP&A; merged with the Michigan Southern & Northern Indiana Railroad in May 1869 to form the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (LS&MS;). Witt was elected a director of the new company, a position he held until his death in 1875. Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad John Brough. Witt changed Brough's life by not only encouraging him to run for Governor of Ohio in 1863, but also in securing for Brough the financial independence that would enable him to so do. Brough's place in history was secured by Witt. In 1849, Harbach, Stone, and Witt won a contract to build the Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad (B&I;). The Indiana portion of the line was finished in 1852, and the Ohio portion in July 1853. Witt was elected a director of the B&I; in July 1853, a position he held until 1865.; ; ; ; He was named to the board's executive committee in 1861 and 1862. Witt was elected a director of the Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Cleveland Railroad (IPCR) in 1856 after the B&I;'s sister railroad in Indiana, the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad, entered into a joint operating agreement with the IPCR on March 14, 1856. John Brough, a newspaper publisher and president of the Madison and Indianapolis Railroad, was elected the B&I;'s president in 1862. Witt encouraged Brough to run for Governor of Ohio in 1864. Knowing that Brough could not afford the large reduction in pay, Witt agreed to become president of the B&I; and forward his salary to Brough. Brough gave his assent, and continued to receive the income from Witt until Brough's death on August 29, 1865. Brough became one of the greatest \\"war governors\\" of the American Civil War. Witt was elected president of the B&I; after Brough died in September 1865, and held that position until the B&I; merged with the CCC&I; on May 16, 1868.; Other railroads Frederick Harbach died of a heart attack in February 1851, but Stone and Witt kept the construction firm going. In December 1853, Stone and Witt won a contract from the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad to build a line from Chicago to the Illinois-Wisconsin border. This work consisted of two contracts. The first was to clear and grade the line, and the second was to build the track. This latter work was not finished until 1858. Once more, both men took a significant portion of their pay in stock, and when the stock rose in value they became wealthy. Stone and Witt actually managed operations on a portion of the Chicago & Milwaukee for some time, and Witt was elected to the road's board of directors in 1867. In 1868, Witt, Stone, and Cleveland businessmen Hiram Garrettson and Jeptha Wade invested in and constructed the Cleveland and Newburgh Railroad. This steam streetcar line cost $68,000 ($ in dollars) to build, and ran for down Willson Avenue (now East 55th Street) and then Kinsman Road to the Village of Newburgh (now the southwest corner of the Union-Miles Park neighborhood). Witt was a director of the line in 1874. In 1868, Witt was elected a director of both the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad and the Indianapolis and St. Louis Railroad. Witt was elected president of the Valley Railway in 1874, and was still serving in this position at the time of his death the following year. That same year, he was elected a director of the Detroit, Monroe and Toledo Railroad, and was holding that position in 1875 when he died. Other business interests Banking The national news media called Stillman Witt one of Cleveland's greatest bankers of the post-Civil War period. Witt first entered the banking business in 1856. That year, he partnered with Hinman Hurlbut, James Mason, Henry Perkins, Joseph Perkins, James Mason, Amasa Stone, Morrison Waite, and Samuel Young to purchase the Toledo Branch of the State Bank of Ohio. Witt was elected a director of Cleveland's Bank of Commerce in 1859. He held that position through 1863, when the bank reorganized as the First National Bank of Cleveland. Witt was elected to the new bank's board of directors. Witt co-organized the Cleveland Banking Company in 1863 with George B. Ely, George A. Garretson, Amasa Stone, and Jeptha Wade, and was elected to its first board of directors. He held this position until 1868, when it merged with the Second National Bank in 1868. Witt, who had been a director of the Second National Bank since 1866,; Witt was elected a director of the merged bank in 1873. Witt was elected a vice president of the Society for Savings, one of Cleveland's biggest banks, in 1867, and a director of the Commercial National Bank in 1879 and 1873. Standard Oil John D. Rockefeller. Witt supported Rockefeller's oil endeavors at a critical time, and Rockefeller later called Witt one of his closest friends. Through his role as one of Cleveland's most respected bankers, Witt played a significant role in the founding of Standard Oil. In the fall of 1871, Cleveland oil refiner John D. Rockefeller learned of a conspiracy being promoted by Thomas A. Scott (First Vice President of the Pennsylvania Railroad) and Peter H. Watson (then a director of the LS&MS;): Using a vaguely-worded corporate charter Scott had obtained from the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the Pennsylvania Railroad, the New York Central Railroad, the Erie Railroad, Standard Oil, and a few small oil refining companies would create and invest in the South Improvement Company (SIC). The SIC's participating railroads would give the SIC's investor-refiners a 50 percent rebate on oil shipments, helping them to drive competitors out of business. Additionally, any time the SIC carried the oil of a non-participating refiner, the SIC would give a 40-cents-per-barrel payment ($ in dollars) to the investor-refiners. The SIC would also provide the investor-refiners with information on the shipments of their competitors, giving them a critical advantage in pricing and sales. Rockefeller saw the SIC as the ideal mechanism for achieving another goal: A monopoly on oil refining in Cleveland. Once the SIC had severely weakened his competitors, Standard Oil would buy out the city's 26 major oil refining companies at fire sale prices. The monopoly would allow Standard Oil to dominate the national refining market, garner significantly higher profits, and drive even more competitors out of business. With higher profits, Standard Oil could then rapidly expand, becoming the nation's dominant oil refining company. To make the purchases, Standard Oil needed cash. To secure the cash, Rockefeller allowed Amasa Stone, Stillman Witt, Benjamin Brewster, and Truman P. Handy‚Äîall of whom were officers in Cleveland banks‚Äîto buy shares in Standard Oil at par in December 1871. Witt and the other bankers used their influence at their own and other banks to give Rockefeller the financial backing he needed. Witt now owned the equivalent of 5 percent of the entire outstanding stock of Standard Oil. The SIC conspiracy collapsed in March 1872, but between February 17 and March 28, 1872, Rockefeller was able to buy out 22 of the 26 major refiners in Cleveland, an event which historians call \\"the Cleveland Massacre\\". Witt played a part in the success of the event. Rockefeller knew that if he bought out the weak refiners first, he'd generate opposition and never get a chance to take on the larger, more profitable ones. So he tackled his strongest competitor, the firm of Clark, Payne & Co., led by Oliver Hazard Payne and backed by the wealthy J. G. Hussey family. In December 1871, Rockefeller asked Payne to meet him at the Second National Bank in Cleveland to discuss business matters in which the bank had an interest. Witt and Amasa Stone were both officers in the bank. Payne swiftly agreed to a merger of his interests with Rockefeller's, and the transaction closed in early January 1872. Witt continued to play a role in aiding Standard Oil financially. Rockefeller approached the Second National Bank for a major loan in early 1872. Amasa Stone expected the much younger Rockefeller to be deferential and suppliant, but he was not. Stone angrily opposed the loan during a bank board of directors meeting. After Rockefeller made his case to the board, Stone suggested that Payne and Witt arbitrate the dispute. The two officers voted to support Rockefeller. Witt once more came to Rockefeller's aid a few months later. On July 30‚Äì31, 1872, Standard Oil's terminal at Hunters Point, New York, suffered a devastating fire. With the company's insurer refusing to pay until after an investigation, Standard Oil was in desperate need for cash to rebuild. The officers of the company asked Rockefeller to seek another loan from the Second National Bank. At a meeting between Rockefeller and the bank's directors, Stone demanded that Standard Oil be appraised and its financial condition assessed before any loan was issued. Offended, Stillman Witt approved the loan, and Stone was stymied. Steel, telegraphy, and insurance Stillman Witt also had financial interests in the iron and steel industry. The iron and steel manufacturing firm of Chisholm, Jones and Company had organized in 1857. It was reorganized in 1860 as Stone, Chisholm & Jones after receiving major investments from Stillman Witt, Henry Chisholm, Amasa Stone, Andros Stone, Henry B. Payne, and Jeptha Wade. Witt made a second investment in the firm in November 1863, reorganizing the steel mill into the Cleveland Rolling Mill (later known as the American Steel & Wire Co.). Witt was named a director of the new company. Witt was elected a director of the Mercer Iron & Coal Company in 1865, director of the Pittsburgh and Lake Angeline Iron Company in 1870, and president of the Union Steel Screw Company (a new firm organized by himself, Henry Chisholm, William Chisholm, Henry Payne, Amasa Stone, and Andros Stone) in 1872. Through his association with Jeptha Wade, Witt also served on the board of directors of Western Union from October 1869 to October 1872.; ; Witt also co-founded and was the first president of the Sun Insurance Company. Organized in Ohio, it spread to Massachusetts in 1869; Wisconsin in 1870; Kentucky, Illinois, and New York in 1872; and Michigan in 1874. He was still president at the time of his death. Charitable activities Stillman Witt was a lifelong Baptist. He co-founded the Protestant Home for the Friendless Stranger (an orphan asylum) in Cleveland in 1852, and served as its president in 1866. He was elected a national lay director of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society in 1869, and built Idaka Chapel in 1874 for use as a missionary church by First Baptist Church of Cleveland (of which he was a member). Witt's charitable endeavors were widespread. He co-founded in 1854 and served on the first board of directors of the Cleveland Female Seminary, a school for girls and young women (located on Kinsman Avenue [now Woodland Avenue] between Sawtell Avenue and Wallingford Court). He served on the board of directors for the secular Cleveland Orphan Asylum in 1858 and as one of its trustees in 1867. He served as a trustee of the Ohio State Institution for the Blind from 1865 to 1870, and was one of the largest donors to the Cleveland Charity Hospital (now St. Vincent Charity Medical Center) when it was founded in July 1865. Shortly before his death in 1875, he was elected a vice president of the Cleveland ASPCA. Witt was civic minded as well. He served as a founding member of the Cuyahoga County Military Committee, which formed in 1863 to help recruit volunteers to fight for the Union during the American Civil War. Company A of the 124th Ohio Infantry was known as the \\"Stillman Witt Guards\\". He also served as treasurer of a committee which raised funds for needy soldiers' families. His service found national expression when he was elected an associate member of the United States Sanitary Commission in 1861. He remained on the commission through 1864. Witt's work for the Sanitary Commission garnered him national attention. He was so well-respected that he was appointed an honorary pallbearer for the coffin of Abraham Lincoln when Lincoln's remains were transported through Cleveland on their way to Illinois in April 1865. He became friendly with a number of President Lincoln's associates through his Sanitary Commission work as well. In 1869, Witt discovered that former Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton was impoverished after leaving the federal government. Witt quietly gave Stanton $5,000 ($ in dollars) to lift his family out of poverty. Witt was also one of the major original investors in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery when that organization was first founded in 1869. He was elected to the Lake View Cemetery Association's first board of trustees in 1870. Death 1883 bust of Stillman Witt by Erastus Dow Palmer. About 1871, Witt fell ill with rheumatism (probably rheumatoid arthritis gout). He traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 1873 to seek relief, and appeared to recover. The disease returned in 1874, and this time he sought treatment at the mineral springs at Green Springs, Ohio. With the illness still afflicting him, Witt decided to travel to Europe in late spring of 1875 to seek the restoration of his health. He sailed for Europe on the SS Suevia. A severe storm struck the ship after a few days at sea. The storm appeared to have significantly abated, and Witt ventured on deck with other passengers on April 28. He was thrown from his deck chair by a sudden wave, and injured his head. The wound appeared minor, but the following day he began to suffer from a migraine. His physical health rapidly declined during that day, and he was attended to by his personal physician and the ship's doctor. He appeared to rally, but died peacefully in his sleep at about 11 PM local ship's time on April 29. Witt's death caused widespread mourning in Cleveland, where he had an immense reputation for integrity and management. His death was \\"a public calamity\\", the Cleveland Leader newspaper declared. Stillman Witt was interred at Albany Rural Cemetery near Albany, New York. Witt left a fortune worth $3 million ($ in dollars) to his wife and daughters. Personal life Stillman Witt married Eliza Arnold Douglass in June 1834. The Witts had four children: Emma, Eugenia, Giles, and Mary. Only Emma and Mary survived into adulthood. Legacy About 1851 or 1852, Stillman Witt built a mansion for his family at what is now 1115 Euclid Avenue in Cleveland. Considered one of the most beautiful homes in Cleveland at the time, the Neoclassical style edifice featured massive Ionic columns in front. The mansion was remodeled in 1875, shortly before his death. Witt's home helped cement Euclid Avenue's reputation as a location for the wealthy to build their homes, and extended the enclave's boundaries. In 1869, Witt purchased for $5,000 ($ in dollars) a house and lot at 16 Walnut Street, and donated these to the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) as a boarding home for single, unwed mothers. The boarding home moved in 1908 to the corner of Prospect Avenue and E. 18th Street, and was named the Stillman Witt Boarding Home in Witt's honor. In 1884, Witt's estate built a hotel named The Stillman at Euclid Avenue and E. 21st Street. Fire destroyed its upper floors in 1885. The hotel was torn down between 1901 and 1902. Although little is known about it, a steam tugboat was named for Stillman Witt. It operated on the Hudson River, Erie Canal, and Great Lakes, and sank in January 1858.

Recorded between April 1, 2017 and August 21, 2017 at The Ministry of Sound in Atlanta, Georgia, the album was engineered by Luke Campolieta and produced by both Luke and the band.  Background and recording  Following the release of their EP, The Castration of the Idiot, A Very Loud Death took a 7-month break to develop chemistry with their new drummer, Cole O'Neil Robertson. At that time, Chris Edge and Bryan Peel already had half of the album written as well as about 20 other songs, with the tracks for Lanterns selected because they were \\"darker and heavier and more fitting of the art direction at the time\\". According to Edge, it wasn't until the track, \\"The Wild\\", had been written with Cole that the band found a direction and concept for the album and were able to finish writing the second half of the album. They approached Luke Campolieta at one of their concerts in November 2016 about doing a possible full length. Two months later they finalized a date and began pre-production. While all of the tracks went through pre-production, with Edge writing the lyrics and the band formulating the arrangements and overall direction, any songs with lead melodies, harmonies, backing vocals, effects, noise, and any post-production were written in the studio, often on the fly utilizing free jazz, noise rock, jam band, industrial, narrative, and experimental techniques.  Critical reception  The album has received generally favorable reviews from independent music critics. On October 16, 2017 Adam Harmless of GAD! Zine said of Lanterns \\"This recording is a mystery...You're gonna think you've heard this before, but it's richer and more interesting.

Not over the top, just moody music...there is a bit of beauty in the darkness of A Very Loud Death.\\" Pat \\"Riot\\" Whitaker, of RiffRelevant.com, gave a positive review, saying about Lanterns, \\"‚Ä¶what they are is rather cool, emotionally riveting post-metal/progressive rock‚Ä¶the trio provide some powerfully illuminating music‚Ä¶it is as haunting as it is beautiful‚Ä¶‚Äù Brian Lush of RockWired Radio and Magazine, gave a favorable review stating of Lanterns, \\"The album is a dark, moody listen that combines primal punk energy with a more nuanced, progressive rock aesthetic. It's a sound that is sure to take the band beyond their stomping grounds and into that cherished glow of indie rock recognition, and dare we say 'fame'.\\" One of the more interesting reviews came from Kayla Hutton of imperfectFifth.com, who said of Lanterns \\"The best way to describe A Very Loud Death‚Äôs latest offering is that there is enough dramatic loudness to wake up empathy in a stone-cold psychopath.\\" On July 10, 2018 Andrew Duncan of Selective Memory Mag said \\"...The bottom line is that Lanterns is a great album.

Von Overstolz, A woman of the century Philippine Espenschied Von Overstolz (May 1, 1847 ‚Äì September 6, 1925) was a musician, linguist and artist. Early life Philippine Espenschied Von Overstolz was born on May 1, 1847, in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of Louis Espenschied (1821-1887), a wagon-maker owner of Louis Espenschied Wagon Co., and Catherine Weber (1824-1887). She was of German-Spanish descent. Her father was one of the first settlers of St. Louis. Through the affluence of her highly-cultured parents she was enable to enjoy rare advantages of education and full development of the talent she possessed. In early childhood, she had a well- equipped art studio, and it was at the time the only private studio in St. Louis. At the age of eight years, she won medals and other premiums for pencil-drawings and several studies in oil, and she continued to win premiums offered to young artists until her thirteenth year, when a serious illness caused by the effects of oils prevented further paint work. She took up the study of vocal music. In instrumental music, she commanded a knowledge of harp, piano, organ, violin, mandolin and banjo, and her proficiency was marked. She had an aptitude for language, and in Germany she was pronounced an exceptional German scholar for one born and bred an American. Career Her talent for modeling was evident, and without any instruction she achieved success. Busts of herself in bronze and marble were made by the distinguished sculptor, Frederick Ruckstull, and exhibited in the Paris Salon. Other were displayed at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. In her husband, Henry Overstolz, Overstolz found help and encouragement in both art and literature. One of his legacies to her was a large library and a collection of paintings, valued at $100,000 ($100,000 in 1893 are $2,591,699.31 in 2017), which was widely exhibited in large fairs and expositions and requested for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. She was a patron of arts and helped young artists like William Merritt Chase, William Henry Howe, Wiemer, Tracey, George Chambers (son), Joseph Rusling Meeker, Frederick Ruckstull. Later in life, Overstolz undertook the study of medicine as an additional provision for herself and live children against possible adversity and graduated from a western medical college. Personal life In 1875 Philippine E. Von Overstolz married Henry Clemens Overstolz (1822-1887), a member of the oldest living German family in the world, and twice mayor of St. Louis. The Overstolz ancestry was direct from the Roman family named Superbus, and whose home, \\"The Tempel-Haus,\\" on the banks of the Rhine, No. 43 Rhein-Strasse, Cologne, Germany, was retained by the royal rulers of Germany.

The area also features varied environments from restored prairie, forests, and lakes, along with providing a multitude of recreational opportunities such as hiking, birdwatching, fishing, camping, and hunting. The Kettle Moraine Scenic Drive also extends within this region as well as through a larger portion of the state. This section of the state forest has campgrounds at some of the larger nature reserves like Whitewater Lake, Ottawa Lake, and Pinewoods. There are also several horse-accessible campsites for trail riding. Some more well-known trails throughout the Southern Unit are the Ice Age Trail, Scuppernong Trails, John Muir Trails, and Emma Carlin Trails. These pass within the Kettle Moraine's state natural areas and some even connect different state parks or other trails throughout Wisconsin to one another. Some of these trails provide opportunities for more primitive camping within designated sections along them.  Whitewater Lake  Whitewater Lake, located in Walworth County, is an extension of the Kettle Moraine's Southern Unit and is part of the southernmost edge of its territory. This 625 acre lake is located in the country side near Whitewater, Wisconsin, and has several public access points for boat launching and fishing. Commonly home to Panfish and Largemouth Bass, the lake draws fishers year round. Northern Pike and Walleye are also present in this lake but are less common. The local community also offers annual fishing events here such as an ice fishing \\"Fish-A-Ree\\". The land around the lake is rural and consists of a mix of private residences, farms, as well as protected forest lands and a restored prairie habitat. A portion of the Ice Age Trail also extends through a section of forest near the lake and provides day trip hiking and backpacking opportunities.A view of Rice Lake from the shoreline The forest around Whitewater Lake consists of a mix of several species of oak, maple, birch, pine, and other trees. It also contains Whitewater Lake Campground which provides sites for overnight camping stays and hiking trails.  Rice Lake  Rice Lake is smaller than Whitewater Lake at 144 acres, is also located in Walworth County, and they are both connected by water flow. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources states that this connected lake also provides a habitat for similar fish species like \\"Panfish, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike\\".  Clifford Messinger Dry Prairie and Savanna Preserve (No. 230)  The Clifford Messinger Dry Prairie and Savanna Preserve is a State Natural Area of Wisconsin that covers 254 acres. It consists of several different locations in the Southern Unit and features sections of restored prairie and savanna. This preserve is SNA, or State Natural Area, number 230. The plants found here are common fixtures in prairie ecosystems, such as side-oats grama, golden rod, and blazing-star. A close up of prairie blazing-star, a flowering species of plant that can be found in SNA 230 The Wisconsin DNR owns this SNA and manages occasional controlled burns to mimic natural fires that are beneficial to the native prairie and oak savanna habitats found here. A section of this State Natural Area is located alongside Whitewater Lake and adjoins the surrounding forest area.  Ice Age Trail  The Ice Age Trail is a volunteer-maintained National Scenic Trail found in Wisconsin that spans approximately 1,200 miles and 31 counties. It is a work in progress with new land continuously being added or improved upon to restore and protect the natural ecosystems found along it while establishing more sections of trail. The trail is designed to follow the path that the last glaciers carved on the land as they passed through Wisconsin. A section of this trail extends past Whitewater Lake.

As a long non-coding RNA, it belongs to a family of RNA transcripts that are not translated into protein (ncRNAs). Of these ncRNAs, lncRNAs are transcripts of 200 nucleotides or longer and are almost three times more prevalent than protein-coding genes. Nevertheless, only a few of the almost 60,000 lncRNAs have been characterized, and little is known about their diverse functions (transcriptional interference, chromatin remodeling, splicing, translation regulation, interaction with miRNAs and siRNAs, and mRNA degradation). BC200 is one lncRNA that has given insight into their specific role in translation regulation, and implications in various forms of cancer as well as Alzheimer's disease. The accepted gene symbol for the BC200-coding gene is BCYRN1, for Brain cytoplasmic RNA 1.  Characteristics  A repeat polymorphism of cytosines and adenines (CA) was found to be near BCYRN1 and was used as a reference for mapping the gene. Linkage mapping and radiation hybrid mapping localized the BCYRN1 gene to chromosome 2p16. As a long non-coding cytoplasmic RNA, BC200 RNA is a part of the largest group of non-coding transcripts in the human genome, which is more prevalent than protein coding genes. The 5' region (left arm) of monomeric Alu short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs) allows for BC200 RNA transposition and has been evolutionarily conserved in other primates. Of this group of SINEs, BC200 is one of few that are transcriptionally active. In humans, it is found in neuropil areas which are composed of predominantly unmyelinated dendrites, axons, and glial cells. Similarly, the functional analog of BC200 RNA in rodents (BC1 RNA) is expressed largely in somatodendritic domains of the nervous system, making it an ideal model for experimentation. One large difference is in origin; BC200 emerged from retrotransposed Alu domain, while BC1 originated from retrotransposed tRNAAla. Although they evolved separately, both are not usually expressed in non-neural somatic cells, with the exception of tumors.  Structure  The BC200 RNA is the product of an unprocessed monomeric Alu sequence. It is 200 nucleotides long and non-translatable. BC200 has three distinct structural domains. The 5' region of the RNA defines one domain and consists of Alu repeat elements. The other two structural domains are a central A-rich region, and a C-rich 3' region specific to BC200. The 5' end of this molecule has both primary and secondary structure that is very similar to 7SL RNA, a signal recognition particle RNA (SRP) which also includes a 5' Alu domain. The BC200 RNA gene has two pseudogenes: BC200 beta and BC200 gamma. These two pseudogenes each have a single gene in the genome, located on separate chromosomes. The beta pseudogene is composed of a BC200 RNA gene and additional Alu sequences. The gamma pseudogene contains an inverted long interspersed nuclear element (LINE). They both have transpositional ability, but the exact mechanism is unknown.  Biosynthesis  BC200 RNA Biosynthesis The biosynthesis of BC200 RNA occurs at the cell body of a neuron and requires upstream promoter elements, downstream internal promoter elements (intragenic A and B boxes), at least two transcription factor binding sites, a TATA-like sequence, TATA-box binding protein (TBP), and RNA polymerase III. There is a deletion of sequences between -100 to -1 in the DNA that blocks transcription activity, revealing that the transcription complex must interact with this 100-bp sequence of the upstream region for proper synthesis of BC200 RNA. The TATA-box binding protein (TBP) binds here, and when inhibited, BC200 RNA levels decrease, indicating that the 100 base pair region and TBP are critical players in the biosynthesis of BC200 RNA. In addition to upstream elements, there is an upstream TATGAAA sequence (similar to TATA box sequence) at positions -28 to -22 which, when deleted, compromises transcription, revealing this TATA-like sequence as another critical player in the synthesis of BC200 RNA. However, transcription is not dependent on the TATA-box binding protein binding to the TATA-like sequence. Both upstream and internal promoter elements are also essential for BC200 RNA synthesis. There are two types of upstream promoter elements in the 100 base pair region: one proximal to the transcription start site and associated with downstream transcription factor binding sites, and the other between nucleotides -36 to -100 and not associated with downstream binding sites. The internal promoter elements are intragenic A and B boxes with A located at position +5 to +15 and B located at position +78 to +88. Any mutation in these boxes can result in a decrease of BC200 RNA. Because BC200 RNA acts as a translational regulator, it is then transported to the dendrites to bind to specific proteins involved in translation and inhibit their activity (see next section).  Function  BC200 RNA is expressed in the dendrites as ribonucleoprotein particles. Protein synthesis at the synapses of neurons contribute to neuronal plasticity and help prevent neuronal degradation. Small, non-coding RNAs such as BC200 RNA work to repress translation by inhibiting its initiation. During eukaryotic translation, the preinitiation complex binds mRNA and scans the coding strand for a start codon. This step is often subject to the control of a family of initiation factors and these factors are often a target for translational regulators. Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) has been shown to bind to BC200 RNA further confirming their role as regulators of protein biosynthesis in synapses. BC200 RNA targets an ATP-dependent RNA helicase called eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A). eIF4A requires energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind the double helix and initiate translation. However, BC200 RNA interferes with the transmission of energy after hydrolysis by changing the conformation of eIF4A, and thus the energy needed to unwind the double helix is never appropriately supplied and initiation of translation is inhibited. This highly localized uncoupling of the ATPase activity, and subsequently the unwinding of the RNA duplex is proposed to have evolved as a result of the growing complexity of postsynaptic neurons and neuronal activities. Non-coding RNA molecules evolve at a much faster rate than gene- encoding proteins; thus, the sustained conservation of the BC200 RNA transcript indicates its importance for nervous system function.  Applications and role in disease   Cancer  BC200 RNA has been found to be a factor in numerous types of cancer. Although this type of RNA is normally expressed in neurons, it has been detected in cancers of the breast, cervix, esophagus, lungs, ovaries, parotid glands, tongue, and the colon. In certain cancers, expression of BC200 RNA is upregulated. This occurs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and higher expression is considered to be a predictor of poor prognosis and may serve as a predictive biomarker for the disease. It was also discovered to be overexpressed in tumor cells of colorectal cancer where the transcript is located just next to a known oncogene, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Here, expression of BC200 RNA and EpCAM are believed to be correlated as they both play a role in cell migration and invasion. Conversely, research has indicated that BC200 RNA is downregulated in ovarian cancer, as it is a tumor suppressor in normal ovarian cells controlling proliferative ability.  Alzheimer's disease  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from synaptic plasticity failure. BC200 RNA plays a role in the dendrites of neurons thought to modulate synthesis of proteins that influence this plasticity. Researchers posit that upregulation of BC200 RNA results in an inadequate delivery of RNA to the neuronal synapses, thus resulting in neurodegeneration. In comparing healthy brains with those with AD, it was determined that BC200 RNA is upregulated in the brains of people with AD, most notably in areas of the brain that correspond to the disease. A direct relationship was observed here, the more severe the disease, the higher the levels of BC200 RNA there were. This is in contrast to a normal aging brain where a steady decrease of this RNA is observed between the ages of 49 and 86.  Potential target  LncRNA has evolved rather recently from those of other species but still maintains some functionality. With regards to this specific form, researchers believe that it can serve as a diagnostic and predictive biomarker for cancers where its normal expression is altered. Much work is still required to fully understand the function and regulatory mechanisms of BC200 RNA but new approaches may seek to develop probes for human BC200 RNA that will assist in developing novel pharmaceuticals. As RNA polymerase III is responsible for transcribing BC200 RNA, it can also serve as a potential target for addressing disease where the expression of it is elevated.

The phrase has received criticism for its repeated usage in the context of gun violence or terrorism, with critics claiming \\"thoughts and prayers\\" are offered as substitutes for action such as gun control or counter- terrorism. Usage history White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders using the term \\"thoughts and prayers\\" in reference to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting and the victims of Hurricane Maria After the 2017 Congressional baseball shooting, Nancy Pelosi sends \\"thoughts and prayers\\" for Steve Scalise. The phrase thoughts and prayers is frequently used as an expression of condolences for victims of natural disasters (e.g., Hurricane Katrina (2005), the 2010 Canterbury earthquake 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake, and Hurricane Maria [2017]). In addition, \\"thoughts and prayers\\" are also offered to victims of numerous mass shootings, including the Columbine High School massacre (1999), the November 2015 Paris attacks, the Orlando nightclub shooting, and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. President Donald Trump has been known to use the phrase. In 2016, he used it following the St. Joseph courthouse shooting, the Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, and the shooting of Nykea Aldridge, cousin of professional basketball player Dwyane Wade. In 2017 he used it following the Congressional baseball shooting in June and the Southern California wildfires in December. In 2018, Trump used the phrase following the Marshall County High School shooting in January, the Carcassonne and Tr√®bes attack in March, the YouTube headquarters shooting in April, and the Capital Gazette shooting in June. Following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018, Slate noted that several Republican politicians who had previously used the idiom (including Trump and senators Marco Rubio and Pat Toomey) avoided using the specific phrase \\"thoughts and prayers\\" in response to the shooting. Trump, for example, instead offered \\"prayers and condolences\\" via Twitter. Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister of Australia, offered his thoughts and prayers to the victims of the 2019 Australian bushfires in November 2019, for which Morrison was criticized and compared to American politicians who repeated similar phrases in lieu of gun ownership reforms. Views After a natural or human-caused disaster, people may be urged to \\"go beyond thoughts and prayers\\", by donating blood or sending aid or money to help the victims. After the Las Vegas shooting, authorities said that although thoughts and prayers are appreciated, the most effective way to help was to give blood. Academic studies have been performed on whether an act of token support leads to sustained contributions; the concept of moral self-licensing, in which prior good deeds can empower individuals to subsequently behave badly, or conversely, whether prior immoral actions can lead to compensatory moral actions has also been cited as a factor in the use of \\"thoughts and prayers\\" in lieu of action. Criticism As \\"thoughts and prayers\\" became associated with post-tragedy condolences, many have criticized the phrase as a form of slacktivism. Jonathan Foiles, writing in Psychology Today, compared the phrase to an infantile response and explained that Thoughts and prayers' is the linguistic equivalent of yelling for something to be different when you have the ability to effect that change yourself\\". After the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of The Nation, called on politicians to \\"move beyond thoughts and prayers\\". In her post, vanden Heuvel referred to a press release by Paul Helmke, then-president of the Brady Campaign, who offered his thoughts and prayers but also stated \\"it is long overdue for us to take some common-sense actions to prevent tragedies like this from continuing to occur.\\" Video of President Obama delivering a statement on a 2015 shooting and criticizing \\"thoughts and prayers\\" In October 2015, following the Umpqua Community College shooting, President Obama said that \\"thoughts and prayers [do] not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted some place else in America next week or a couple months from now.\\" The White House subsequently announced that Obama would continue to take more executive action on the subject of gun control. On December 2, 2015, in the wake of the San Bernardino mass shooting, Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) tweeted his frustration with the phrase \\"thoughts and prayers\\", a sentiment echoed by the December 3 cover of the New York Daily News, which included tweets from senators and representatives the newspaper characterized as \\"meaningless platitudes\\". After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018, demands for \\"policy and change\\" were used as a pithy rejoinder to the typical \\"thoughts and prayers\\" offered by politicians. Student survivors of the shooting were joined by religious leaders in calling for concrete legislative actions. By August 2019, as reported by the Gun Violence Archive, there were 251 mass shootings in the United States only 216 calendar days into the year. Robin Lloyd, managing director of the nonprofit Giffords, stated \\"The days when politicians can get away with offering thoughts and prayers are over. The public knows thoughts and prayers won't prevent the next tragedy.\\" Lloyd called upon Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take action on gun control legislation passed by the House but not heard in the Senate. Religious criticism Some critics of the phrase \\"thoughts and prayers\\" point to the Epistle of James in the Christian New Testament to argue that action is needed in addition to expressions of faith. Verses commonly cited to back up this argument include: Pope Francis stated \\"Prayer that doesn't lead to concrete action toward our brothers is a fruitless and incomplete prayer. ... Prayer and action must always be profoundly united\\" in his Sunday Angelus message on July 21, 2013. In 2018, the Dalai Lama stated on Twitter that he was \\"skeptical that prayers alone will achieve world peace. We need instead to be enthusiastic and self- confident in taking action.\\" Others have taken issue with the public declaration of prayer, calling it an \\"obligatory public lament\\" instead of an expression of genuine concern. Defense Laura Coward, a writer for The Huffington Post, defended the use of the phrase \\"thoughts and prayers\\", acknowledging the inadequacy of not taking actions, but arguing that prayer \\"jolts us and disrupts us, removing us from our comfort zones [... it] takes us to uncomfortable places ‚Äì spiritually, physically and emotionally ‚Äì and asks us to do the hard work of accepting more than one perspective.\\" Kimberly Ross, a writer for RedState, asks that victims should \\"not [be] used as pawns in another political debate about guns\\" since \\"[w]e shouldn't blame anyone but the perpetrator for crimes committed, ... that means we can do nothing on our own ‚Äì in that moment ‚Äì apart from submitting thoughts and prayers.\\" The criticism of the phrase \\"thoughts and prayers\\" has itself received criticism as insensitive to those who sincerely pray for victims. Katelyn Beaty argued that prayer \\"is perhaps the most powerful form of action you can engage in during a crisis\\", citing studies which showed that regular meditation and prayer improved focus and reduced anxiety, touting the potential beneficial effects for \\"better policy solutions than would an urgent, fretful, ill- considered response\\", akin to the \\"now is not the time\\" arguments favored by the NRA. In 2019, following a weekend in which mass shootings occurred in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee suggested that, of the continued occurrence of mass shootings, \\"the lack of thought and prayers is probably the single biggest factor in what is behind them\\". Distraction using \\"now is not the time\\" The ineffectiveness of \\"thoughts and prayers\\" can be a deliberate choice. President Obama stated in October 2015 that \\"to actively do nothing is a [political] decision as well.\\" In many instances, the same people who offer \\"thoughts and prayers\\" also criticize proposed reforms as being too quick to politicize a tragedy. Like the propaganda technique of whataboutism, criticizing potential reforms as being too political can distract politicians from taking direct action by effectively pointing towards unlikely or fringe reasons for the tragedy; for example, advocating for mental health reform or Islamic terrorism prevention in lieu of passing gun control laws. Gun politics in the United States The momentum for gun control legislation in the United States has been blunted repeatedly by the use of the phrase \\"now is not the time\\", offered as a defense against what could potentially be hastily-drafted laws. David Weigel pointed out that repeated calls to wait for an \\"appropriate time\\" to discuss gun control is the strategy used by the National Rifle Association (NRA) to avoid meaningful legislative action. The BBC called \\"the enthusiasm gap\\" the \\"single biggest obstacle to new gun-control laws\\" in the United States: \\"Pro- gun politicians offer their thoughts and prayers, observe moments of silence and order flags flown half-staff. Then, in the quiet, legislative efforts are deferred and ultimately derailed.\\" Following the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, several politicians used the phrase \\"thoughts and prayers\\" in place of taking immediate legislative action. President Barack Obama called for \\"meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this regardless of the politics\\", and New York mayor Michael Bloomberg challenged him to go further: \\"the country needs [Obama] to send a bill to Congress to fix this problem ‚Äì and take immediate executive action. Calling for 'meaningful action' is not enough. We have heard that rhetoric before. What we have not seen is leadership ‚Äì not from the President and not from Congress. That must end today. This is a national tragedy and it demands a national response.\\" The resulting proposed federal legislation to control guns, including universal background checks, failed to pass Congress; after the bipartisan Manchin-Toomey amendment failed on April 17, 2013, Obama called it \\"a pretty shameful day for Washington\\". Following the Orlando nightclub shooting in June 2016, astronomer and skeptic Phil Plait wrote that while it was \\"natural and very human\\" to \\"send their thoughts and express their grief ... it's cynically hypocritical when politicians do it and nothing else\\", later noting it was \\"particularly galling\\" to see \\"all the NRA-funded lawmakers tweeting their 'thoughts and prayers. An accompanying Slate post provided a selected list of members of Congress who had tweeted \\"thoughts and prayers\\" along with the amount of campaign contributions they had received from gun rights groups, based on research provided by Igor Volsky of the Center for American Progress. NRA donations to politicians who expressed \\"thoughts and prayers\\" in lieu of meaningful gun control legislation were again publicized after the Las Vegas shootings in October 2017 and the Stoneman Douglas shooting in February 2018. Protestor's sign at March for Our Lives, Washington DC (2018) After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Florida state senators held a contentious debate on SB 7026, which included funding for mental health programs and authorized teachers and school officials to carry concealed firearms; among the amendments that failed were a ban on assault weapons, large-capacity magazines, a gun registry, and requiring background checks for guns purchased out-of-state. Opponents of the ban on assault weapons included Sen. David H. Simmons, who drew an analogy to Nazi Germany's ban on private ownership of firearms, and Sen. Kelli Stargel, who questioned whether the ban would be extended to fertilizer (used in the Oklahoma City bombing) and pressure cookers (used in the Boston Marathon bombing). Stargel added \\"When we say 'thoughts and prayers,' it's frowned upon. And I take real offense at that because thoughts and prayers are really the only thing that‚Äôs gonna stop the evil from within the individual who is taking up their arms to do this kind of a massacre.\\" Following the Saugus High School shooting in November 2019, Saugus alumnus and former Representative Katie Hill released a statement saying her \\"thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families in my community today\\". Her statement also singled out Senator Mitch McConnell, saying he believed \\"it is more important to protect the NRA and the money he receives than it is to protect our kids\\" as McConnell has refused to advance four separate gun control bills that had passed the House but were not taken up by the Senate. Senator Chris Murphy moved to pass the universal background checks bill the same day the shootings had occurred, but the motion was blocked by Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith; both senators learned about the shooting after Hyde-Smith had blocked the bill. Vice President Mike Pence, in California for a tour of NASA Ames, expressed support for the Saugus High School community, conveying the hearts and prayers \\"of every American\\", adding \\"This president and this administration will remain resolved to bring the scourge of mass shootings to an end. And we will not rest or relent until we end this evil in our time and make our schools and communities safe again\\", which was received with skepticism on social media. Earlier that year, Pence had promised that \\"Under this President and this Vice President, no one is taking your guns. Under this President and this administration, the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\\" in an April speech before the NRA convention, held in Indianapolis. Gun control in other countries After the Christchurch mosque shootings in 2019, prominent international figures offered their thoughts and prayers, including Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan, Pope Francis, and Tsai Ing-wen. New Zealand legislators responded by passed a law banning the ownership of most semi- automatic weapons aside from pistols under limited circumstances. The response in New Zealand was singled out as a counterexample to \\"the same old tired script: one politician after another condemning the attack and offering thoughts and prayers to the victims and families. But something different happened. Instead of offering thoughts and prayers, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern promised action\\". Prior to the legislation, New Zealand had less restrictive gun ownership than many other Western countries. Social media posts were made mocking the effectiveness of \\"thoughts and prayers\\", comparing the rapid passage of gun control legislation in New Zealand with the repeated failure of United States gun control laws. In many other Western countries, stricter gun control laws have been passed in response to gun violence. Besides New Zealand, new gun control laws have passed in the United Kingdom (after the Hungerford massacre in 1987, and again after the Dunblane massacre in 1996), Australia (the National Firearms Agreement, following the Port Arthur massacre of April 1996), Germany (after shootings in Erfurt in 2002 and Winnenden in 2009), and Norway (a belated response to the 2011 Norway attacks). The sustained grassroots campaign that resulted in a ban of all handguns in the UK following the Dunblane massacre of 1996 was contrasted with American inaction in 2018 by a Dunblane resident: \\"I wouldn't want thoughts and prayers, I would want policies and regulation and a grown-up discussion about changing the American gun culture.\\" Climate change In the wake of the February 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, PM Kevin Rudd sent his \\"thoughts and prayers\\" to those affected; a royal commission was set up to investigate the cause and response. The Climate Institute of Australia and the United Firefighters Union of Australia concluded that climate change had caused the extreme forest fire danger index leading up to Black Saturday and may have contributed to earlier bushfires dating back to 2001. During the disastrous 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season, PM Morrison and other government officials extended their \\"thoughts and prayers\\" to the victims; the phrase was criticized for how it was used to deflect attention away from how climate change and government policy may have affected the duration and intensity of the fire season. Also, PM Morrison was singled out for failing to provide support to fire victims. Earlier, in October 2019 PM Morrison had announced he would work to stymie protesters and activists from discouraging businesses from working with the coal mining industry. After the fires prompted him to cut short a vacation to Hawaii in late December, PM Morrison stated he had \\"always acknowledged the connection between these weather events and these broader fire events and the impact globally of climate change\\" and defended the government's actions to mitigate climate change, saying \\"we'll do it without economy wrecking or job destroying. We'll do it with sensible targets that get the balance right.\\" Deputy PM Michael McCormack dismissed the link between climate change and the bushfires as \\"ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies\\", despite the federal National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework report, published in 2018, explicitly tying climate change to natural disasters: \\"Many natural hazards are becoming more frequent and more intense, driven by Australia's changing climate. ... There is growing potential for cumulative or concurrent, large-scale natural hazards to occur.\\" In addition, the State of the Climate 2018 report warned \\"There has been an associated increase in the length of the fire weather season. Climate change, including increasing temperatures, is contributing to these changes,\\" and added \\"The drying in recent decades across southern Australia is the most sustained large-scale change in rainfall since national records began in 1900.\\" Adam Bandt called DPM McCormack \\"a dangerous fool\\" and added \\"[t]houghts and prayers are not enough, we need science and action too\\" in calling for a change in government policy. David Littleproud, Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, stated he did not \\"want to weaponise [climate change policy] in the middle of someone's misery\\", stating it was \\"not the time\\" to discuss the government's policy. Deputy Premier of New South Wales John Barilaro called those who would link climate change to the bushfires a \\"bloody disgrace\\" for politicising the tragedy. Cumulatively, the comments brought forward theories that Australian Greens policies were partially responsible for the intensity of the bushfires by stopping hazard reduction efforts and shifted the debate from the effect of climate change to whether a debate about climate change was appropriate. Although hazard reduction policies have been criticized after previous catastrophic bushfires, the claims that Greens policies have prevented backburning were called \\"very tired and very old conspiracy theories ... an obvious attempt to deflect the conversation away from climate change\\" by Professor Ross Bradstock; the hotter conditions leading to elevated forest fire danger indices for a longer time period instead were blamed for reduced preventative burning. After an estimated 20,000 marched in December 2019 through the smoky streets of Sydney to protest the government's inaction on climate change, DPM McCormack acknowledged that climate change was \\"a factor\\" in the bushfires but added \\"it is important to note that most of these fires have been caused by 'Little Lucifers'\\", alluding to the possibility of arson. Arsonists have been responsible for bushfires in the past, and it was estimated that up to half of all bushfires are the result of arson or suspected arson per year. However, arson is suspected to have caused a small minority of the bushfires in the 2019‚Äì20 season. In culture Visual media In his third stand up special \\"Thoughts and Prayers\\", comedian Anthony Jeselnik skewers people who tweet out \\"thoughts and prayers\\" on the day of a tragedy, calling it a way for those people to garner attention in the face of a tragedy and saying that tweeting thoughts and prayers is so useless that it achieves \\"less than nothing\\". In 2016, a web-based video game, Thoughts and Prayers: The Game, was published to argue that thoughts and prayers have had no effect on saving lives in the context of mass shootings. The fifth episode of the fourth season of animated series BoJack Horseman, titled \\"Thoughts and Prayers\\", presents a real-life shooting that delays the opening of a new movie featuring gun violence. Ironic sympathy for the NRA In early August 2018, after court documents were made public showing the National Rifle Association was having financial issues, satirical tweets were made offering thoughts and prayers for the NRA's troubles. Thoughts and prayers were again directed to the NRA in November 2018 after news broke that free coffee at the headquarters was being discontinued amid a sharp drop in revenue and again in December 2018 after suspected spy Maria Butina pleaded guilty to using her connections with the NRA as a way to infiltrate American conservative groups. After the state of New York announced it would investigate the tax-exempt status of the NRA in April 2019, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced he would remember the organization in his thoughts and prayers. In June 2019, after the NRA discontinued live programming that had been carried on NRATV, \\"thoughts and prayers\\" were sent via social media. In August 2020, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against the NRA, seeking to dissolve it for illegal conduct. The NRA is registered in the state of New York as a 501(c)(4) non-profit corporation, and the suit charges the NRA and four named defendants with failure to fulfill their fiduciary duty, resulting in a loss of $64 million in three years. The March for Our Lives organization responded by sarcastically offering 'thoughts and prayers' to the NRA via Twitter. In music A song entitled \\"Thoughts and Prayers\\" appears on the 2018 album My American Dream by singer-songwriter Will Hoge, who wrote it after the Sutherland Springs church shooting. Hoge told Rolling Stone writer Jonathan Bernstein \\"I know that phrase can be a kind and thoughtful way to express sympathy when there is no other way to help, but after these shootings, using that stock response from these cowards on Capitol Hill is incredibly insulting. They have all the opportunities in the world to make a difference, but they do nothing. Then to just send out a phrase like 'thoughts and prayers,' as if we don‚Äôt all know that there is something they could do? It's shameful.\\" After the Stoneman Douglas shooting in Parkland, Florida, Canadian-American musician grandson wrote and released the song \\"thoughts & prayers\\" on March 23, 2018, which also criticizes politicians who resist \\"any attempt at meaningful gun reform\\". The heavy metal band Motionless in White released a song entitled \\"Thoughts & Prayers\\" on June 2, 2019, the first single from their album Disguise. According to Chris \\"Motionless\\" Cerulli, \\"It's my commentary on the very evil ways that [religion is] used\\". The Raconteurs also released their album Help Us Stranger in June 2019; the closing track is entitled \\"Thoughts and Prayers\\". When asked about that song, Jack White stated \\"That phrase has become meaningless. It's a thoughtless phrase. Basically an insult.\\" The punk group Good Riddance released an album entitled Thoughts and Prayers in August 2019. According to Russ Rankin, \\"I'm sick of hearing that [phrase], especially when there's a mass shooting in New Zealand and the nation takes steps to outlaw semi-automatic weapons in the same week. Meanwhile, here in America, we're dealing with hundreds and hundreds of mass shootings and not doing anything about it.\\" The Drive-By Truckers publicized their song \\"Thoughts and Prayers\\" from the studio album The Unraveling in January 2020. In his review of the album for Rolling Stone, Jonathan Bernstein characterizes the song as taking aim at the phrase he called \\"phony right-wing piety\\". Filter released \\"Thoughts and Prayers\\" ahead of their album Murica in June 2020. Vocalist Richard Patrick called for action in lieu of the phrase: \\"'Thoughts and Prayers' has become a meaningless catchphrase that gets thrown out every time something bad happens. Usually a mass murder etc. It's an empty gesture. It's time for more than thoughts and prayers.\\" See also *List of attacks related to secondary schools *List of rampage killers (school massacres) *Prayer healing and faith healing‚Äîmore general discussions on effectiveness or lack thereof *School shootings in the United States *List of mass shootings in the United States References External links Grief Gun violence Political neologisms Political terminology of the United States Prayer Terrorism ","title":"Thoughts and prayers"},{"id":"55419414","text":"Ron Unsworth (8 November 1923 - 23 December 2008) was a British hurdler.

He pledged allegiance to Ghulam Ahmad, formally joining the Ahmadiyya movement, in 1901. Travelling to the Gold Coast (present day Ghana) in 1921 upon invitation from Muslims in Saltpond, Nayyar was instrumental in consolidating Ahmadiyya missions in several West African countries. Missionary work Abdul Rahim Nayyar was initially sent by the caliph Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad to London in 1919 where he worked, briefly, with Fateh Muhammad Sial. He was instructed by the caliph to leave for the Gold Coast, however, when a nascent group of Sunni Muslims and ex- Christians among the Fante people in the southern region of the colony, no longer interested in remaining under the spiritual supervision of Hausa Muslim clerics from the north, made contact with the caliph in Qadian, India, through the Review of Religions and requested assistance. The Fante Muslims were initially informed of the presence of the Indian-origin Ahmadiyya movement in Nigeria by a resident of Saltpond who himself was originally from Nigeria. Nayyar sailed from London to Freetown, in Sierra Leone. While in Freetown Nayyar delivered a lecture at a mosque in Fourah Bay, in the east end of the city at the request of the city's chief Imam. Although at least six people are said to have conveyed their adherence to the Ahmadiyya movement in Sierra Leone as early as 1916 after being influenced by the circulation of Ahmadiyya literature from neighbouring West African nations, no conversions were recorded following Nayyar's visit. After the brief Hiatus in Freetown, Nayyar continued towards Saltpond in the Gold Coast where he arrived in March 1921. Following a lecture, the Fante community \\"believed there and then\\", following which an oath of allegiance was held. In the history of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mahdi Appah, the leader of this group, is regarded as the first Ghanaian to become an Ahmadi Muslim. Despite resistance from northern clerics, the Fante Muslims converted en masse, giving immediate rise to the Ahmadiyya movement in the region. Nayyar also toured Accra and Kumase. Having established the movement in the Gold Coast, Nayyar left within a month for Lagos, in Nigeria, before returning again in fall of 1921. While in Nigeria, Nayyar made very early connections with other Muslim groups from which many also joined the Ahmadiyya movement including the Imam of a Quranist group. Nayyar left the colony once again in 1922 and was replaced by Al Hajj Fadl-ul- Rahman Hakim, as the first permanent missionary to the Gold Coast. After consolidating the Ahmadiyya missions in West Africa, Nayyar returned to London where he was present when the caliph visited the city to lay the foundation of the London mosque in 1924 and thence returned with the caliph to India.

Lanier (January 19, 1837 ‚Äì March 6, 1926) was an American banker, and railroad executive who inherited the bulk of his father's fortune, who was a close friend of J.P. Morgan. Early life Lanier was born on January 19, 1837 in Madison, Indiana. He was the son of James Franklin Doughty Lanier (1800‚Äì1881) and Elizabeth (n√©e Gardner) Lanier (1798‚Äì1846). He was the brother of Alexander Chalmers Lanier; Elizabeth Frances Lanier, who married Brig. Gen. William McKee Dunn; Drucilla Ann Lanier, who married John Robert Cravens, the Lieutenant Governor of Indiana; Mary Lanier, who married John Cameron Stone; Louisa Morris Lanier; and Katherine Howard Lanier. In 1655, his ancestor, Thomas Lanier, a French Huguenot refugee, came to America accompanied by John Washington, the great-grandfather of President George Washington. Thomas, who settled in Westmoreland County, Virginia, married Washington's daughter, Anne Washington (1662‚Äì1697). Career In 1859, he joined his father in the family banking establishment, Winslow, Lanier & Co., that was founded in 1849 with Richard H. Winslow. He was given an interest in 1860, and later became head of the firm. The younger Lanier worked continuously at Winslow, Lanier & Co. for sixty-seven years, one of the longest careers in banking at that time. He served on the boards of the Southern Railway, the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne & Chicago Railway (of which he was president and his father was the first president), Massillon & Cleveland Railroad, and a trustee of the Central Union Trust Company. In addition, he was a director of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the West Shore Railroad, the Western Union Telegraph Co., The Central & South American Telegraph Co., the Madison Square Garden Co., and the National Bank of Commerce. Lanier was a close friend of fellow banker J.P. Morgan, and the two worked together on many of the largest and most important transactions of the day. Lanier was part of the small group, known as the \\"Corsair Club,\\" as it met on Morgan's yacht, the ‚Äò‚ÄôCorsair‚Äô‚Äô.Vincent P. Carosso, Rose C. Carosso, \\"The Morgans\\" (Harvard University Press, 1987) p. 248 Social affiliations He also served on the board of the American Museum of Natural History for forty-eight years, retiring in 1923. He was a member of the Metropolitan Club, The Union League Club, the Knickerbocker Club, the New York Yacht Club and the Pilgrim Club. Personal life On October 7, 1857, Lanier was married to Sarah E. Egleston (1837‚Äì1898), the daughter of Thomas Egleston. Together, they were the parents of: * James Franklin Doughty Lanier (1858‚Äì1928), who married Harriet Arnold Bishop (1866-1931), daughter of Heber R. Bishop. in 1885. * Sarah Eggleston Lanier (1862‚Äì1893), who married Francis Cooper Lawrance Jr. (1858-1904). After her death in 1893, Lawrance married Susan Ridgway Willing, the sister of Ava Lowle Willing (the wife of John Jacob Astor IV). * Fanny Lanier (1864‚Äì1958), who was married to Francis Randall Appleton (1854‚Äì1929). * Elizabeth Gardner Lanier (1870‚Äì1935), who was married to George Evans Turnure (d. 1933). In 1882, Lanier and his wife built an estate called \\"Allen Winden\\" in Lenox, Massachusetts. After Lanier‚Äôs death in 1926, the house was demolished, and replaced by a simpler home designed by Henry Seaver. Lanier died on March 6, 1926 at his residence, 20 East Thirty- Sixth Street in Manhattan. He left an estate valued at $9,677,364.

In 1974, Isobel Smith expanded this term because she discovered the vessels spread across the British Isles to Lyles Hill in Northern Ireland. The vessels represent the earliest pottery style of the British Stone Age. The long-lasting Grimston- Lyles Hill ware is characterized by its use of fine materials, good workmanship and kumpf-like shapesA kumpf is a high, sometimes closed bowl with a biconical or rounded profile and mostly accentuated rim. See Fowler, Harding and Hofmann with a shoulder profile and turned-over edge. More recently, the term \\"carinated bowl\\" (CB) or \\"shouldered bowl\\" has been preferred, although there are also shoulderless specimens. All are (except for occasional finger fluting) unadorned. Alison Sheridan makes a distinction between the earliest manifestation of pottery, the \\"traditional CB\\" and its later developments, \\"modified (or developed) CB\\". \\"Traditional CB\\" pottery is significantly more consistent and distributed across a wide area in Great Britain and Ireland, while \\"modified CB\\" shows regional differences.

He obtained his Certified System Engineer degree at the Sino-Japanese Software Developing Center, in System Dynamics Modeling in 1985, and holds a Ph.D. from The George Washington University, with a primary focus in Management & Organizations and secondary focus in Philosophy of Social Sciences (1995); Hu came to the US in 1986 as a visiting scholar to study Cybernetics and System Science, back to China in 1988 and left PRC after what happened on June 4, 1989 in Tiananmen Square. He became an American citizen after September 11, 2001. After a diversified career path spanning from research and teaching, entrepreneurship and senior management, training and consulting, he is currently an independent researcher and managing director of WINTOP Organizational Learning Laboratory, a consulting-training partnership based on Phoenix, Arizona, USA.

Personal life  In his spare time, he is a learning photographer, entry-level composer/pianist and blogger. He has traveled and exposed to cultures in 30+ countries and studied 9 major religions. His teaching/training/consulting experiences involve organizations in U.S., China, Hong Kong, Austria, Japan and Thailand. He speaks Mandurian and English proficiently, with limited conversational capacity in German and Japanese.  Work  Hu's inquiries can be classified into three periods: * His early work (1982‚Äì1993) were social problem-identification oriented because he was overwhelmed by the severe social pathologies in PRC caused by communism as well as by the unhealthy elements of the Chinese traditions.Hu (1988, 1991, 1994) His inquiry about what's wrong in the society of China started at his teen age during the notorious \\"cultural revolution\\" stirred up by Mao. * His mid-term work (1993‚Äì2008) were social-solution oriented, focusing on a new communication theory,Hu (1995) large-scale education model, and grassroot participation model, and his scope of concern expanded from the country of China to the country of the United States, and to the sustainability issues of the whole planet. * Hu's latest work (2009‚Äìcurrent) is to establish a theory of the evolution of our civilization based on a synthesis of the cultural gene hypothesis with the multi-layer self-organization theory, which is his extension of classic (single-step) self-organization theories (e.g. of Ashby, Von Foerster, Prigogine & Haken.) This theory provides a new perspective to understand the history, the current status and the possible futures of the human civilization, suggesting priorities for and calling for attentions of action leaders at various levels in our societies.Hu (1988, 2014, 2016) Hu has developed a four-dimensional system thinking framework which was applied to comparative study of organizational dynamics, to an expansion of Ashby's law of requisite variety, and to a new understanding of second-order cybernetics and second-order science. Hu's current ongoing projects includes the following: # Project Polaris for Civilization: developing Instrument to measure Civilization Development Index for nations, publishing Civilization Evolution Theory, identifying current Major Threats to Civilization, establishing Association of Butterfly-effect Communicators. # Project for System Science Curriculum Development: A team effort of 30+ colleagues from 15 countries endorsed and supported by The International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences, World Complexity Science Academy, and World Organization of Systems and Cybernetics. # Project Topics on Organizational Functions of Religions, Ideologies and Science as System of Stories on a Spectrum from Emotionality to Rationality, and Linkages among Three Threads of Evolution ‚Äì of Civilization, of Science, and of Cybernetics. # Project proposal for Scalable Teaching Training Operation for Revolutionizing Education in Developing Countries  Selected publications   References External links *Hu's Website *Club of Remy 1957 births Living people American systems scientists Complex systems scientists Cyberneticists ","title":"Jason Jixuan Hu"},{"id":"55419744","text":"Abingdon ware is a Middle Neolithic (3900-3200 BC), decorated, round-bottomed potteryDarvill (2008), p. 2 found in an ancient causewayed enclosureAbingdon Causewayed Enclosure at Historic England.

Fisher's father moved to Texas with his family in 1837, believing it to be a good place for investment, but utterly ignorant of frontier life. They settled in Refugio County near the Don Carlos Ranch. Never having been inured to hardships, they were ill-prepared for the trials which awaited them. Her father joined the Texas army in 1838, and in 1840 both parents were killed by the Comanches who attacked their home. Rebecca Gilleland and her brother William were captured. In a few hours after the parents' death, the children were rescued by Albert Sidney Johnston and taken to Victoria and stayed with William C. Blair until their aunt, Jane Trimble of Galveston, took charge of them. She attended Rutersville College from 1845 to 1848. Career Fisher's fondness for literature was shown at an early age. For many years she contributed articles for the press, which received high encomiums. For forty-five years she was actively engaged in church and charitable work.
