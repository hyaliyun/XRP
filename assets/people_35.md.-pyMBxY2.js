Premise The film follows 13-year-old Logan, as he comes to terms with his sexual identity, the hell of middle school, wild mountain lions and life with his single mother. Cast * Malcolm Stumpf as Logan * Patrick White as Rodeo * Max Paradise as Joey * Fairuza Balk as Logan's Mom * Kim Dickens as The Counselor * Tom Gilroy as The Principal Production After being work-shopped at the 2005 Sundance Screenwriter's Lab, the film had its world premiere at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, and went on to be screened at New Directors/New Films Festival, London International Film Festival, Locarno International Film Festival and AFI Film Festival. In 2007, the film heavily re-edited and released theatrically by IFC Films. This shorter edition changes the order into chronological scenes, changed the sound and leads to another interpretation of the director's intent with his movie. The original length was 1:38 hours:minutes., and the ICF-film only 1:21. There is a European DVD-release, issued by Soda, edited to an even shorter 1:13. Cinematographer and frequent Archer collaborator, Aaron Platt, received a 2007 Independent Spirit Award nomination for his work on the film. Gus Van Sant and producer Scott Rudin were executive producers on the project, in addition to producers Lars Knudsen and Jay Van Hoy. The film was shot in and around Archer's hometown of Santa Cruz, California. Music The film's soundtrack features music by Comets on Fire, Current 93, Emily Jane White, Nate Archer, Nina Simone, Pantaleimon and Six Organs of Admittance. Emily Jane White's contribution, the song \\"Wild Tigers I Have Known\\", was written specifically for the film and can be heard during the end credits. The song appears on the film's official soundtrack and on White's debut album, Dark Undercoat. In addition, a music video was produced and directed by Archer, and included as an extra on the DVD release of the film.

Looney Tunes theatrical cartoon short directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on April 6, 1963, and stars Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Clips from The Million Hare were used, with color commentary by John Madden and Pat Summerall, as part of the fourth quarter of the 2001 Cartoon Network special The Big Game XXIX: Bugs vs. Daffy. Plot summary During the opening titles, the song \\"With Plenty of Money and You\\" is heard. The camera pans down a stack of TV antennas and enters the underground home of Bugs Bunny, who is being visited by Daffy Duck. As they watch a TV game show called \\"Beat Your Buddy\\", an announcer says he will draw two names from the \\"buddy barrel\\", and that the first namee to reach the television studio will win \\"a million bucks.\\" He then draws Bugs and Daffy's names. Bugs and Daffy race each other to the studio. Daffy finds himself continuously hindered, usually due to his own impatience. For example, he drives a moped onto a bridge under construction and winds up in the water below-forgetting that, as a duck, he can already fly and swim. Bugs, keeping a steady, simple pace, reaches the studio's building first. Daffy dons a jet pack, hoping to beat Bugs to the top floor. He flies to the top floor, grabs Bugs, and zooms out the other end of the building. They land in an antique glass shop and are taken to a hospital. Even though they are in bandages, with Daffy on crutches and Bugs in a wheelchair, they continue the race and Daffy crosses the finish line first. Daffy then discovers that the \\"million bucks\\" is actually a \\"Million BOX\\"‚Äîa huge box filled with one million little boxes. Considering the prize worthless, Daffy gives it to Bugs. The announcer then reveals that \\"inside each of the one million little boxes, there is a crisp, brand-new $1 bill\\"‚Äîthus Daffy has just given Bugs $1,000,000. \\"With Plenty of Money and You\\" is heard again, and the announcer asks Daffy if he wants to say something to the audience. Daffy's head slowly changes into that of a donkey, and he starts braying.

The Karbala Gap is a 20‚Äì25-mile wide strip of land with the Euphrates River to the east and Lake Razazah to the west. This strip of land was recognized by Iraqi commanders as a key approach to Baghdad, and was defended by the Medina and Nebuchadnezzar Divisions\\"\\"The Iraqi high command had positioned the Medina and Nebuchadnezzar Republican Guard divisions to block the Karbala Gap, but Hamdani argued for reinforcements. The Iraqi leadership ignored his appeals, however, because it feared going against President Saddam Hussein's orders and having troops cut off from the defense of Baghdad.\\" The Encyclopedia of Middle East Wars: The United States in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq Conflicts, Spencer C. Tucker, p. 673, ABC-CLIO, 2010 of the Iraqi Republican Guard. American forces attacked Iraqi forces in the area with massive air attacks followed by concentrated armored thrusts which resulted in the Iraqi units being surrounded and annihilated. Initial moves On the night of March 19, 2003, U.S. Army Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha 551 (ODA 551) from the 5th Special Forces Group was infiltrated via three MH-47Es accompanied by MH-60L DAP (Direct Action Penetrators) into an area 100 km from the Karbala Gap to provide eyes-on surveillance of the Gap, the mission became the longest in Green Beret history. ODA 551 drove in their GMVs to the Gap where they set up observation posts and began their surveillance mission; at this time the Gap only contained a small Iraqi Army garrison and the local Fedayeen. Their mission ended on March 30.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.114-115 The Iraqi high command had originally positioned two Republican Guard divisions blocking the Karbala Gap. Here these forces suffered heavy Coalition air attacks. However, the Coalition had since the beginning of March been conducting a strategic deception operation to convince the Iraqis that the US 4th Infantry Division would be mounting a major assault into northern Iraq from Turkey. This deception plan worked, and on 2 April Saddam's son Qusay Hussein declared that the American invasion from the south was a feint and ordered troops to be re-deployed from the Karbala front to the north of Baghdad. Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, who was in command of the Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, the fate of Baghdad would be determined within 48 hours. His suggestions fell on deaf ears. Meanwhile, American troops were pushing through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayib. An expected Iraqi chemical attack did not materialize. At Musayib, American troops crossed the Euphrates in boats and seized the vital al-Kaed bridge (Objective Peach) across the Euphrates after Iraqi demolitions teams had failed to destroy it in time. In response, Lt. Gen. Hamdani was ordered to launch an immediate counterattack. Hamdani later said that his units were not in condition to launch an immediate counterattack and that he counseled to establish a defensive line along the Usfiyah River in order to contain the American breakthrough. Nevertheless, Hamdani's forces launched a counterattack on the night of 2‚Äì3 April. Iraqi counterattacks, 2‚Äì3 April The 10th Armored Brigade from the Medina Division and the 22nd Armored Brigade from the Nebuchadnezzar Division, supported by artillery, launched night attacks against the American bridgehead at Musayib. The attack was savagely repulsed using tank fire and massed artillery rockets, destroying or disabling every Iraqi tank in the assault. The next morning, Coalition aircraft and helicopters counterattacked the Republican Guard units, destroying many more vehicles as well as communications infrastructure. The Republican Guard units broke under the massed firepower and lost any sense of command and cohesion. By the end of the day, the tanks of the 3rd ID had overrun Lt. Gen. Hamdani's headquarters and Hamdani and his staff fled. American forces lost no men killed to Iraqi fire in this action while Iraqi losses are estimated at 230 to 300 killed. Nevertheless, the Iraqi counterattacks had caused enough confusion and Captain Edward Korn was reported killed on 3 April in the Karbala Gap by friendly fire. Destruction of the Medina Division While the fight around Musayib was raging on 3 April, other elements of the US 3rd ID had captured Baghdad International Airport. Before pushing deeper into Baghdad, US commanders decided to mop up the remnants of the Republican Guard Medina Division which were still present south of Baghdad. The intention was to catch the Medina Division from behind, while they were engaging other units to their front. The 2nd Brigade of the 3rd ID under Col. David Perkins was dispatched to the southwest towards Objective Saints, the codename for the intersection between highways 1 and 8. The interchange was defended by dismounted infantry, and during the fight for Objective Saints one US soldier was wounded and an M1 Abrams tank was disabled by an RPG round (it was later repaired). After capturing Objective Saints on the 3rd, the 2nd Brigade pushed south and made contact with the remnants of the 10th and 2nd Brigades of the Medina Division. Despite reports that 80% of the division's vehicles had been destroyed, the Iraqis had moved their vehicles away from their prepared defenses and hidden them near buildings and in palm groves, sparing many of them from air attack. Hundreds of Iraqi tanks, IFVs and artillery were still present. The American tanks tore into the Iraqi vehicles, destroying many of them at point blank range. Despite the survival of many of their vehicles, the Iraqi defense was un-coordinated and many troops put on civilian clothes and deserted during the fight, leaving their uniforms on the battlefield. The Medina Division ceased to exist as an effective fighting force. Aftermath The Battle of the Karbala Gap had been a one-sided engagement in which elements of the 3rd Infantry Division annihilated the best units in the Republican Guard while suffering minimal losses. The destruction of these elite units left the door to Baghdad wide open for the 3rd ID, and the next day Col. Perkins led the first \\"Thunder Run\\", an armored strike through southern Baghdad. Baghdad would fall within days. However, four days later, the Republican Guard scored a direct hit on the Third Infantry Division, Second Brigade's Tactical Operations Center, with an Al-Samoud variant rocket, estimate 280 kg payload warhead, killing three soldiers, two foreign reporters, wounding 14 additional soldiers, and destroying 22 vehicles, mostly unarmored Humvees.

Biography The son of a colonist/soldier in what is now Bibai, Hokkaid≈ç, Sanada graduated from Sapporo South High School and the army cadet school in Sendai before being accepted into the 31st class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. He graduated in 1919 and served as a junior officer with the IJA 9th Infantry Regiment. He subsequently graduated from the 39th class of the Army Staff College in 1927. He was assigned to the Tokyo Defense Headquarters in 1929, and held a number of administrative posts at the Army Ministry from 1931. Sanada was sent as a military attache to Europe from October 1936. After his return to Japan in March 1937, he returned to the Army Ministry and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November of the same year. From August 1938, he was Secretary to the Army Minister Seishiro Itagaki. Promoted to colonel in August 1939, he was assigned command of the IJA 86th Infantry Regiment. In January 1940, he was made Army liaison to the Japanese China Area Fleet during the Second Sino-Japanese War. His subsequent career was that of a bureaucrat within the Army Ministry.

From December 1942, he was chief of the 2nd Bureau (Planning) within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. From October 1943, he was promoted to major general and head of the 1st Bureau (Operations) within the General Staff. In this role, he visited the front lines at Guadalcanal from December 17‚Äì25, 1942.

J. Cronin. The film was adapted by Nunnally Johnson, directed by John M. Stahl, and produced by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. It stars Gregory Peck, Thomas Mitchell, and Vincent Price, and tells the story of the trials and tribulations of a Catholic priest who goes to China to evangelize. Plot Father Francis Chisholm is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth at his parish in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti- Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey. Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice. Because the Church hadn't given the mission money for rice in over a year, \\"the faith left them when the rice gave out.\\" Francis rents a small room in the city to evangelize, but because he has no money or influence, he is attacked by those same \\"rice Christians\\" who were supposed to help him. A young pilgrim named Joseph finds Francis in town, and restores his faith in his mission by offering to help rebuild the church out of Christian duty and not for money. Francis then receives medical supplies from his childhood friend Dr. Willie Tulloch, which allows Francis to offer services to the sick. Francis is summoned to the home of local official, Mr. Chia, to heal Chia's only son of his infection. Joseph is apprehensive because if Chia's son dies, Francis will be in danger, but Francis goes anyway. He saves the boy, but Chia and his household are ungrateful because Francis' methods and faith were so contrary to the local tradition. A few weeks later, Chia comes to Francis in order to convert to Christianity, but Francis rejects him because he would not be converting for the proper reasons. Instead, Chia thanks Francis by giving the mission many acres of land and all of Chia's workers in order to build a thriving mission. Two years later, the buildings are almost done, but the nuns arrive a day earlier than planned and Francis is disheveled when they show up. Francis' relationship with the Reverend Mother Maria- Veronica is tense, but they put aside personal differences when the town is the scene of a battle between republican and imperial troops. Willie visits from Scotland and is able to create a makeshift hospital, but the church is destroyed in a fire set by imperial troops. Willie is then shot, and eventually dies. The imperial general then gives Francis a choice: either all food and money from the mission are given to the general or the mission and everyone inside of it is destroyed. Joseph and Francis come up with a plan to sabotage the imperial troops, and Francis is forced to leave his impartiality and blows up the imperial troops. Later, Angus arrives‚Äînow a Monsignor‚Äîas he is making a review of world missionary sites. He tells Francis that the Church cannot pay for the rebuilding of the mission, and that Francis has the lowest conversion rates in the world. Angus implores Francis to convert rich Chinese and live in luxury in order to impress the locals, but Francis refuses. Meanwhile, the Reverend Mother apologizes for her \\"shameful\\" behavior towards Francis and begs for forgiveness, which she receives. Ten years pass, and Francis' mission is flourishing, and the area is peaceful. The Reverend Mother tells Francis that American Methodists are building a mission inside town, and Francis goes to visit them. Francis becomes friends with the Methodist missionaries, and peace continues. More years pass, and as Francis prepares to depart China, he learns that Angus is now Bishop. The flashback ends, and Monsignor Sleeth admits to Francis that he read the diary. Francis is flattered, and Sleeth tells Francis that he won't tell the Bishop anything is amiss at Francis' parish, leaving Francis be as he spends his remaining time doing what he loves doing: serving a parish. CastProduction Alfred Hitchcock liked the novel and hoped to direct it, but opted to direct Lifeboat. Actors considered for the role of Father Chisholm included Spencer Tracy, Orson Welles, Edward G. Robinson, Gene Kelly, and Henry Fonda. Ingrid Bergman was considered for the part of Mother Maria-Veronica, though Rose Stradner, the wife of producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz, was cast instead. Reception Variety called The Keys of the Kingdom a \\"cavalcade of a priest's life, played excellently by Gregory Peck.\\"\\"The Keys of the Kingdom\\" Variety, December 31, 1944 Awards and honors The film was nominated for Academy Awards in the following categories: * Best Actor in a Leading Role (Gregory Peck) * Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Black-and-White (James Basevi, William S. Darling, Thomas Little, and Frank E. Hughes) * Best Cinematography, Black-and-White (Arthur C.

When Daffy asks about the decorations, Speedy says that he does not see anything. Daffy decides that the mice have planned a party and have chosen not to invite him. He then sets out on ruining their party. He builds a machine that creates a raincloud. Instead of raining on the mice, the cloud follows Daffy and causes him many problems. He is struck by lightning, he is caught up in a tornado and he is constantly rained upon (it's possible the raincloud had a will of its own and didn't want Daffy to ruin the preparations). After suffering much torture from the raincloud, Daffy learns that the fiesta is really his surprise birthday party. Daffy breaks into tears, because he is so extremely happy in all of his life.

Nadolo's brief time at Exeter was fairly troublesome. He was registered at Exeter under his Australian passport and was mistakenly picked alongside two other non-Kolpak players. This is a breach of IRB regulations and resulted in Exeter being docked two points and fined ¬£5,000. Also while at Exeter he was arrested by police for drink driving. He was subsequently banned from driving for 18 months and fined ¬£950. Nadolo was immediately released from his contract with the club. =Japan= Nadolo played for the NEC Green Rockets in the Japan Top League between 2011 and 2013. =Super Rugby= In October 2013, Nadolo signed to play for Crusaders in the 2014 Super Rugby season.

He went on to play 14 Super Rugby games, including 12 starts, in his first season and was the equal top try scorer with Israel Folau, notching 12 tries. He scored a try in both the semi-final and final but it wasn't enough to win the Super Rugby title as his Crusaders team lost to his former team, the Waratahs, by 33‚Äì32. In August 2014, Nadolo re-signed with the Crusaders for two more seasons. =Top 14= In November 2015, Nadolo signed a three-year deal with French Top 14 side, Montpellier. He will leave at the end of the 2020 Super Rugby season. =Premiership Rugby= In March 2020 it was announced that Nadolo would be joining Premiership side Leicester Tigers for the 2020-21 season. Nadolo made his debut on 26 August 2020 at Welford Road in a match against London Irish, with Nadolo impressing in a 13-7 win. International career Nadolo made his Test debut in 2010 when selected in the 24-member Fiji team for a one-off match against Australia, followed by the 2010 IRB Pacific Nations Cup. In June 2014, he joined the Fiji for the one-off test against Italy. He was instrumental in that game playing at his preferred position of Inside centre scoring 13 points including a try. A week later in the 2014 IRB Pacific Nations Cup, he faced Tonga scoring 20 points including a try and kicking 6 conversion and a long-range penalty. A week later, against Samoa, he scored a try but it was not enough for a win as Fiji lost in a nail-biting encounter, 13‚Äì18. In his final game for Fiji in June in the 2015 Rugby World Cup ‚Äì Oceania qualification match against Cook Islands. He scored a hat-trick of tries and in the process equalled the all-time record set by Christian Cullen and John Kirwan of scoring 10 tries in consecutive matches. He returned for Fiji in 2015 and played on the wing against the MƒÅori All Blacks in Suva but while scoring a try, he damaged his pectoral muscles which ruled him out for 6 weeks and the 2015 World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup. He was nevertheless included in the final 31-member squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. He returned to play for Fiji in a warm-up game against Canada on the left wing and though he didn't score a try, he kicked 5 conversions and 4 penalties with his boot ending the game with a 100% kicking percentage.

Central Avenue, after which the area is named, was in the 1930s and 1940s a vibrant center for jazz. At this time the infamous covenant line along Washington Boulevard demarcated the areas where African Americans were allowed to live. Even the giants of jazz music, such as Duke Ellington were allowed to play in Hollywood and other areas, but they could not stay there. They often stayed at the now-historic Dunbar Hotel. The Dunbar Hotel featured a nightclub called the Club Alabam, where the jazz greats would play after hours. All around the hotel there were numerous other clubs featuring jazz and blues, which were the launching point for the careers of many well-known musicians. One of the aims of the festival is to raise funds for the preservation of the Dunbar Hotel. The festival takes place on several blocks of Central Avenue, south of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, which includes the Dunbar Hotel. There are many booths with food, arts and crafts, as well as community outreach programs. The festival is free of charge, and in previous years has included free secure parking at a local school. The festival was started in 1996 and has regularly featured a number of prominent jazz, blues, and Latin Jazz musicians who got their start in the area, such as Teddy Edwards, Gerald Wilson, Arthur Blythe and Ernie Andrews. A strong component of the festival's format has been to spotlight young Los Angeles musicians, such as Kamasi Washington, and Kalil Wilson, as well as talent from the neighborhood's high school bands and choirs. The festival distinguishes itself in that it is a thoroughly non-commercial event. There is no over-bearing corporate sponsorship and there are no concessions made to commercialism.

Colonial era  From the outset, the colonial administration required that all instruction be in French, with the exception of religion classes, which could be taught in local languages. As early as 1925, the state imposed a standard curriculum on all institutions wishing official recognition and government subsidies. The state extended its influence to education, even though the majority of Chadian students attended private mission schools before World War II.Chad country study. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Education in Chad has focused on primary instruction. Until 1942, students who desired a secular secondary education had to go to schools in Brazzaville, the capital of the AEF. This restriction limited the number of secondary-school students. Between World War I and World War II, only a dozen Chadians studied in Brazzaville. Once in Brazzaville, students received technical instruction rather than a liberal arts education, entering three- year programmes designed to produce medical aides, clerks, or low-level technicians. State secondary schools were opened in Chad in 1942, but recognized certificate programs did not begin until the mid-1950s.  Independence  At independence in 1960, the government established a goal of universal primary education, and school attendance was made compulsory until age twelve. Nevertheless, the development of standard curricula was hampered by the limited number of schools, the existence of two- and three-year establishments alongside the standard five and seven-year colleges and lyc√©es, and the Muslim preference for Quranic education. Even so, by the mid-1960s 17 percent of students between the ages of six and eight were in school. This number represented a substantial increase over the 8 percent attending school in the mid-1950s and the 1.4 percent immediately after World War II. Although the academic year in Chad parallels the French schedule, running from October to June, it is not particularly appropriate for a country where the hottest part of the April and May. Quranic schools throughout the Saharan and Sahelian zones teach students to read Arabic and recite Quranic verse. Although traditional Islamic education at the secondary level has existed since the nineteenth century, students seeking advanced learning generally have studied in northern Cameroon, Nigeria, Sudan, or the Middle East. In Chad, modern Islamic secondary schools have included the Ecole Mohamed Illech, founded in 1918 and modelled after Egyptian educational institutions. Other schools included the Lyc√©e Franco-Arabe, founded by the colonial administration in Ab√©ch√© in 1952. The lyc√©e offered a blend of Arabic, Quranic, and secular French education. Numerous observers believed that although the creation of a French-Islamic program of study was commendable, the administration's major objective was to counter foreign Islamic influence rather than to offer a viable alternative curriculum. Despite the government's efforts, overall educational levels remained low at the end of the first decade of independence. In 1971 about 88 percent of men and 99 percent of women older than age fifteen could not read, write, or speak French, at the time the only official national language; literacy in Arabic stood at 7.8 percent. In 1982 the overall literacy rate stood at about 15 percent. Major problems have hindered the development of Chadian education since independence. Financing has been very limited. Public expenditures for education amounted to only 14 percent of the national budget in 1963. Expenditures increased over the next several years but declined at the end of the decade. In 1969 funding for education dropped to 11 percent of the budget; the next year it declined still further to 9 percent. In the late 1980s, the government allotted only about 7 percent of its budget to education, a figure lower than that for all but a few African countries. Limited facilities and personnel also have made it difficult for the education system to provide adequate instruction. Overcrowding is a major problem; some classes have up 100 students, many of whom are repeaters. In the years just after independence, many primary-school teachers had only marginal qualifications. On the secondary level, the situation was even worse; at the end of the 1960s, for example, the Lyc√©e Ahmad Mangu√© in Sarh (formerly Fort-Archambault) had only a handful of Chadians among its several dozen faculty members. During these years, Chad lacked sufficient facilities for technical and vocational education to train needed intermediate-level technicians, and there was no university. In the 1970s and 1980s, Chad made considerable progress in dealing with problems of facilities and personnel. To improve instruction, review sessions and refresher programs have been instituted for primary-school teachers. On the secondary level, increasing numbers of Chadians have taken their places in the ranks of the faculty. Furthermore, during the 1971‚Äì72 school year, the Universit√© du Tchad opened its doors. Another problem at independence was that the French curricula of Chadian schools limited their effectiveness. Primary instruction was in French, although most students did not speak that language when they entered school, and teaching methods and materials were often poorly suited to the rural settings of most schools. In addition, the academic program inherited from the French did not prepare students for employment options in Chad. Beginning in the late 1960s, the government attempted to address these problems. A number of model schools discarded the French-style of a formal, classical education in favor of a new approach that taught children to reinterpret and modify their social and economic environment. Rather than teaching French as it was taught in French schools to French children, the model schools taught it more appropriately as a foreign language. These new schools also introduced basic skills courses in the fourth year of primary school. Students who would probably not go on to secondary school were given the chance to attend agricultural training centers. All of the preceding problems were complicated by a fourth difficulty: the Chadian Civil War. Little has been written specifically about how this conflict has disrupted education, but several effects can reasonably be surmised. Lack of security in vast parts of the country undoubtedly has made it difficult to send teachers to their posts and to maintain them there, which has been particularly problematic because as government employees, teachers often have been identified with government policies. In addition, the mobility occasioned by the war has played havoc with attempts to get children to attend classes regularly. The diversion of resources to the conflict has also prevented the government from maintaining the expenditure levels found at independence, much less augmenting available funds. Finally, the violence has taken its toll among teachers, students, and facilities. One of the more dramatic instances of this was the destruction and looting of primary schools, lyc√©es, and even the national archives attached to the Universit√© du Tchad during the battles of N'Djamena in 1979 and 1980. The government has made major efforts to overcome these problems. In 1983 the Ministry of Planning and Reconstruction reported that the opening of the 1982‚Äì83 school year was the most successful since the upheavals of 1979. In 1984 the Universit√© du Tchad, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, and the Ecole Nationale des Travaux Publics reopened their doors as well. Ministry of Education In the late 1980s, the Ministry of Education had administrative responsibility for all formal schooling. Because of years of civil strife, however, local communities had assumed many of the ministry's functions, including the construction and maintenance of schools, and payment of teachers' salaries.

Entering as a cadet in the regiment of infantry of Gerona, Rafael Izquierdo reached the military rank of captainGu√≠a de forasteros en Madrid para el a√±o de 1861.Emma Helen Blair, James Alexander Robertson: The Philippine Islands 1493-1898. by the age of 17 when he participated in the First Carlist War in Navarre. At the start of the Second Carlist War which took place in Africa, Izquierdo was already a lieutenant colonel and at the end of the war brigadier general. He was then assigned to Lugo, Spain as military governor in 1861. The following year he was assigned as lieutenant-general to Puerto Rico before becoming an interim Governor-General when Rafael Echag√ºe y Bermingham vacated the position. Izquierdo then went back to Spain until in 1868 when he supported the revolution in AndalusiaGregorio de la Fuente Monge: Los revolucionarios de 1868: √©lites y poder en la Espa√±a liberal. and was tasked as deputy for Malaga and AlicanteCongreso de los Diputados de Espa√±a: Archivo hist√≥rico de diputados. in 1869 until 1871. Philippine governorship Priests Mariano G√≥mez, Jos√© Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora Replacing General Carlos Mar√≠a de la Torre on April 4, 1871, Rafael Izquierdo was installed as Governor-General of the Philippines. He is responsible for the opening of steamship and telegraph lines in the country. He was also known to have promptly rescinded the liberal measures, thus implementing harsher laws, which ignited an uprising. The reformation suggested that the soldiers of the Engineering and Artillery Corps should pay taxes, from which they were previously exempt. Another drastic change was the requirement to perform manual labor. These changes eventually led to the 1872 Cavite mutiny, in which around 200 soldiers of the Engineering and Artillery Corps revolted and killed their officers. In retaliation, many liberals were implicated in the involvement of the conspiracy. The Spanish military court condemned the martyred priests, Fathers Jos√© Burgos, Mariano G√≥mez and Jacinto Zamora (GOMBURZA), to capital punishment by means of the garrote, on February 17, 1872. This uprising led to delays in rebuilding Malaca√±an Palace, and in turn almost transferred colonial governance back within the walls of Intramuros for security purposes. The plan to transfer the colonial government to Intramuros ended when Izquierdo fell ill and he stepped down from his position on January 8, 1873. Rafael Izquierdo spent the remaining years of his life in Madrid, Spain, where he died in 1882.

It may form tufts or a thin purple \\"turf\\" up to 5 millimetres high. The filaments branch infrequently, usually at the tips. Morphology In most species of Rhodochorton, the spore does not persist in the mature plant; instead, a basal web of filaments acts as a holdfast. Indeed, all Rhodochorton species have distinct basal threads, usually forming a disc, and upright threads, which are typically thinner. Lateral branches usually occur at or near the top of the patent cell, and branching is concentrated towards the tips of threads. Ecology The organism may encrust bare rock surfaces, or be epiphytic upon frondose algae - particularly Laminaria hyperborea. It typically grows in the shadow of these larger algae, in the intertidal zone, and its adaption to low light levels means it is also common in caves. It reproduces in winter using tetrasporangia and don't bear any monosporangia. Rhodochorton is typically marine, but R. investiens dwells in fresh water. Sexual reproduction has never been observed. It suffers grazing pressure from gastropods and amphipods, but amazingly fragments of the algae are able to pass through the grazers' digestive tracts alive - grazing may actually form a mode of dispersal for the organism. Life history Rhodochorton investiens displays a relatively simple life cycle for a red alga. In the Carposporophyte: a spermatium merges with a trichogyne (a long hair on the female sexual organ), which then divides to form carposporangia - which produce carpospores. Carpospores germinate into gametophytes, which produce sporophytes. Both of these are very similar; they produce monospores from monosporangia \\"just below a cross wall in a filament\\" and their spores are \\"liberated through apex of sporangial cell.\\" The spores of a sporophyte produce tetrasporophytes. Monospores produced by this phase germinate immediately, with no resting phase, to form an identical copy of parent. Tetrasporophytes may also produce a carpospore, which germinates to form another tetrasporophyte. The gametophyte may replicate using monospores, but produces sperm in spermatangia, and \\"eggs\\"(?) in carpogonium.

The original data values which fall into a given small interval, a bin, are replaced by a value representative of that interval, often the central value. It is a form of quantization. Statistical data binning is a way to group numbers of more or less continuous values into a smaller number of \\"bins\\". For example, if you have data about a group of people, you might want to arrange their ages into a smaller number of age intervals (for example, grouping every five years together). It can also be used in multivariate statistics, binning in several dimensions at once.  Image data processing  In the context of image processing, binning is the procedure of combining a cluster of pixels into a single pixel. As such, in 2x2 binning, an array of 4 pixels becomes a single larger pixel, reducing the overall number of pixels. This aggregation, although associated with loss of information, reduces the amount of data to be processed, facilitating the analysis. For instance, binning the data may also reduce the impact of read noise on the processed image (at the cost of a lower resolution).  Example usage  Histograms are an example of data binning used in order to observe underlying distributions. They typically occur in one-dimensional space and in equal intervals for ease of visualization. Data binning may be used when small instrumental shifts in the spectral dimension from mass spectrometry (MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments will be falsely interpreted as representing different components, when a collection of data profiles is subjected to pattern recognition analysis. A straightforward way to cope with this problem is by using binning techniques in which the spectrum is reduced in resolution to a sufficient degree to ensure that a given peak remains in its bin despite small spectral shifts between analyses. For example, in NMR the chemical shift axis may be discretized and coarsely binned, and in MS the spectral accuracies may be rounded to integer atomic mass unit values. Also, several digital camera systems incorporate an automatic pixel binning function to improve image contrast. Binning is also used in machine learning to speed up the decision- tree boosting method for supervised classification and regression in algorithms such as Microsoft's LightGBM and scikit-learn's Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Classification Tree.

Chief Military Coordinator of Federal Relief Commission (FRC) Following the devastating Pakistan earthquake that killed 73,338 people, injured 128,304, and rendered 3.5 million people homeless, then Maj-Gen Nadeem Ahmad (close friend of Nadeem Ahmed Advocate) was appointed Chief Military Coordinator for the Military Wing of the Federal Relief Commission (FRC). The FRC at that time was headed by Lt Gen (R) Farooq Ahmad Khan, who was in-charge of relief efforts from the civilian side. Maj-Gen Nadeem and the Pakistan Army worked with the United Nations and other representatives of national and international agencies, donor countries and NGOs, to plan and implement the massive relief operations.

The community was settled in 1880 and died out in the early 20th century. The town, which is about northwest of Meteor Crater, was the closest community to the crater when portions of the meteorite were removed. Consequently, the meteorite that struck the crater is officially called the \\"Canyon Diablo Meteorite.\\"METEOR CRATER: PROOF OF IMPACT - amnh.org - Retrieved September 19, 2008 History Cowboys hold up the corpse of outlaw John Shaw, who died in the Canyon Diablo shootout, 1905. The ramshackle community originated in 1880, due to construction delays attributed to the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad ordering the wrong span length railroad bridge across the canyon. The bridge story is that the original bridge when ordered was not long enough to span Canyon Diablo, and this was only discovered when the bridge arrived on site from the manufacturer. Consequently, for six months the transcontinental railroad ended at the lip of Canyon Diablo while another bridge was manufactured and shipped to the work site. The original pillars the bridge was mounted on were excavated from the surrounding Kaibab Limestone and shaped on site by Italian stonemasons. The ruins of the lodgings of the railroad workmen are on the west end of the bridge site. Although the railroad ended at the edge of the canyon, work on the railroad route still progressed. Crews were sent ahead to survey the route, prepare the grade and bed, cut and prestage railroad ties and other supplies in advance of the iron rails that would accompany the trains once the canyon was spanned when the new bridge arrived. Work quickly progressed until the A&P; crew linked up with the Southern Pacific Railroad crews at Needles, California on August 9, 1883. Originally a small mobile business community catering to the needs of railroad men, once the railroad stopped at the edge of the canyon this community quickly produced numerous saloons, brothels, dance halls, and gambling houses, all of which remained open 24 hours a day. No lawmen were employed by the community initially, so it quickly became a very dangerous place. Its population was mostly railroad workers, along with passing outlaws, gamblers, and prostitutes. The town was designed with two lines of buildings facing one another across the rock bed main street. The center street, however, was not named Main Street, but \\"Hell Street\\". It consisted of fourteen saloons, ten gambling houses, four brothels and two dance halls. Also on this street were two eating counters, one grocery store, and one dry goods store. Scattered about in the vicinity of downtown were large numbers of tents, shotgun houses, and hastily thrown up shacks that served as local residences. Within a short time the town had 2,000 residents. A regular stagecoach route from Flagstaff to Canyon Diablo began running and was often the victim of robberies. Within its first year, the town received its first marshal. He was sworn in at 3:00pm, and was being buried at 8:00pm that same night. Five more town marshals would follow, the longest lasting one month, and all were killed in the line of duty. A \\"Boot Hill\\" cemetery sprouted up at the end of town, which in less than a decade had 35 graves, all of whom had been killed by way of violent death. The 36th grave was that of former trading post owner Herman Wolfe, who died in 1899, the only one to have died a nonviolent death. Herman Wolfe's trading post was at \\"Wolfe's Crossing\\" on the Little Colorado River about 12 miles north of Leupp, Arizona and near a place called Tolchaco. Herman Wolfe died there and his body was transported to Canyon Diablo for burial. Currently Wolfe's grave is heavily monumented and the story is that after World War II a relative from Germany found his grave and installed the headstone and other improvements on the grave site. When the railroad bridge was completed, the town quickly died. The original railroad bridge was replaced in 1900 with a new bridge to carry heavier locomotives and cars. By 1903, the only thing remaining in the town was a Navajo trading post. A new double track railroad bridge was completed across the Canyon in 1947. What remains today at Canyon Diablo are a few building foundations, the grave marker and grave of Herman Wolfe, the ruins of the trading post, a railroad siding and a double track railroad bridge. Access Access to Canyon Diablo is north on a very poor road from Exit 230/Two Guns off Interstate 40. A high ground clearance vehicle is recommended.

He first worked in railways in 1847, and worked his way up through various railways, leading to being an assistant engineer for the Army of the Potomac during the Civil War. Near the end of the war, he was placed in charge of all government railways. He returned to private industry in 1867, eventually leading to employment with Northern Pacific Railroad in 1881. There, he led construction of railways connecting St. Paul with both Portland and Seattle. He was vice president of the company from 1886 until leaving in 1888. After leaving Northern Pacific, he worked in an office in New York City for another year, where he shot himself on May 14, 1889. He died the next day. Early career Anderson was born in Ridgeway, New York on July 25, 1827. Anderson began his railway career in 1847, as chainman on the New York and New Haven Railroad. From October 1847 to November 1848, he was assistant engineer of the Connecticut River Railroad; from November 1848 to September 1848 assistant engineer on the Mobile and Ohio; from that date to March 1850 assistant engineer on the Ashuelot Railroad in New Hampshire. Afterward he was successively resident engineer of the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana; locating engineer of the Mobile and Ohio; chief engineer on the Tennessee and Alabama; chief engineer and superintendent of the Edgefield and Kentucky; and for a short time chief engineer of the Henderson and Nashville. When the Edgefield and Kentucky failed, General Anderson was appointed receiver. high bridge across Potomac Creek using Haupt's new design, Adna Anderson seated center-left and Eben C. Smeed seated right. When the American Civil War broke out General Anderson offered his services to the United States government, and was made assistant engineer and chief of the Construction Corps of the Army of the Potomac in Virginia. In the following year he was made general superintendent of Government Railroads of the Military Division of the Mississippi. From November 1864 to July 1866 he was chief superintendent and engineer of all the military railroads. From February to May 1867, he was chief engineer of the Illinois and St. Louis Bridge; afterwards general superintendent of the Kansas Pacific Railway; then vice- president and general manager of the Toledo, Wabash and Western. General Anderson was made president of the LaFayette, Muncie and Bloomington Railroad in 1873; he was appointed receiver of the Chicago, Danville and Vincennes in May 1875; in February 1880 he was made chief engineer of the Northern Pacific Railroad. Northern Pacific career In the latter part of 1881 General Anderson took a long and fatiguing journey over the proposed line of the Northern Pacific, making a personal inspection of the proposed route across the backbone of the continent and through what was then the western wilds. From the observations made on this long journey from Bismarck, North Dakota to Portland, Oregon, General Anderson became satisfied that the general route laid down by the late William Milnor Roberts (a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers), as the line of the Northern Pacific, was in the main correct, at least so far as the line between the Missouri River and Columbia River was concerned, and on this line, substantially, he went on and completed the road, witnessing the driving of the last spike September 8, 1883. The main line having been completed from St. Paul to Wallula where junction was formed with the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company‚Äôs line, thus making a through line to Portland, the company turned its attention to its Cascade Division, intended to connect its line at some point near the mouth of the Snake River, with Tacoma on Puget Sound. Surveys for this division had been in progress much of the time since March, 1880, and much had been done even previous to that date, at intervals, in the way of reconnaissance and preliminary work. The company desired to build on the best attainable line, but to find this line, with conditions then existing, was a work of great difficulty, requiring time, labor and expense. General Anderson took great interest in all this work, but did not express any final judgment until the autumn of 1883, after all the information was available, when he reported that the line ought to be built through Stampede Pass, believing it to be the route that could be operated at least expense and that it would best protect the company from the encroachments of rival enterprises, which judgment has been fully confirmed by the events of the past two years. In October, 1886, General Anderson was elected second vice-president of the Northern Pacific, which position, together with that of chief engineer of this road, he held up to January, 1888. Personal life and death General Anderson married, in 1856, Juliet C. Van Wyck, with whom he had six children. The eldest daughter, Sallie, married United States Navy Lieutenant John C. Fremont, Jr., a son of General John C. Fremont; the oldest son, Philip Van Wyck Anderson, was a civil engineer on the Northern Pacific Railroad. In May 1889 General Anderson opened an office in New York, at 155 Broadway, where he was engaged in organizing the Gordon Fire Alarm Company and the Steel Car Company. About a year before his death he contracted what is known as mountain fever while on one of his western trips, from which he never entirely recovered. On the night of May 14, 1889, Anderson shot himself with a revolver in his room at the Lafayette Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Anderson had checked into the hotel two days earlier, his only baggage being a gripsack, or small suitcase. According to Virgil Gay Bogue, in his 2009 book, Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers, General Anderson was a quiet and somewhat taciturn man, of great integrity and clear, impartial judgment.Virgil Gay Bogue, L.

The Lothas are one of the major tribes in Nagaland. It is also called post harvest festival. Meaning Tokh√º means feast, taking food and drinks. Emong means the Halt on the appointed time. The people rejuvenate themselves after a tremendous hard work on the fields and celebrate this post harvesting festival by making merry and rejoicing. Tokh√º Emong is celebrated in the first week of November every year and it lasts for 9 days. This festival is associated with the harvesting of crops. It is also accompanied by folk dances and singing of old folk songs. It is a festival enjoyed by both the young and the old, praising the gods for their abundant blessings. Tokh√º Emong is also a celebration about brotherhood, forgiveness and oneness. It is celebrated through sharing of food, gifts, folklore narration and a sumptuous community feast. Custom and rituals A proclamation of the starting of the festival to the villagers was done by the village priest. He went from door-to door of the village with a basket for the collection of edibles that may consist of rice. For this purpose Yinga, or supporters also accompanied him. This collection was done prior to the festival as an offering to the Limha Potsow Ha Oyak Potsow (Earth-God and Sky- God). The priest took a small quantity of the contribution and put it into his basket after offering his prayers. It was customary for the villagers to contribute liberally as it is believed that more contribution facilitated more crops during cultivation. A person was said to bring a bad curse upon himself and was expected to spend his life as a beggar if he was reluctant to do such contributions. A fraction of this gathering was used to buy a pig and the rest was kept for making rice-beer. Later, with the help of a bamboo spear, a perforation was made in the pig's heart, then abdomen was sliced open to interpret the prophecy. The destiny of the village was formally declared by the priest, after a moment of deep assessment. The pig was then divided into small portions and distributed amongst every household in the village. If by any chance, a stranger visited the village before the beginning of the festival he was given two alternatives, as per the traditional customs. Either he leave the village prior to sunset or he stay until the time of the culmination of the festival. But he was also treated with hospitality by the villagers, if he decided to stay for the festival. Prayers were offered to the spirits of the people who had died in the respective year. It was customary for the family who lost any member during the year to stay in the village until the last rituals were performed. Tokh√º Emong signified and still signifies, the end of any bitterness and settlement of all problems. It is also a festival of gratitude. Intimacy is observed by forming new ties. The people get properly dressed by wearing their conventional dresses. The wells of the villages are cleaned and the houses are repaired as well. After the festival, marriages were arranged for the young couples, who were engaged during the year. Preparation of a scrumptious meal was done (is still being done now) and shared by the people which were followed by folk dance and folk songs. Exchange of gifts was also done. Dates It was celebrated from 1‚Äì9 November. The date of the festival was not fixed earlier but later a common date for celebration was set by Wokha elders in order to strengthen unity among the community members. Every year the celebration of nine day long festival starts from 7 November. Recently Nagaland Government has set a date on Nagaland Government calendar as holidays for Lothas Tribe only, on 6 and 7 November. There may be a slight difference in some ritual performance and other celebrating activities in between the villages among the Lothas. The village itself had its own priest and customary laws within its village and therefore, act or perform accordingly.

The school has a total enrolment of more than 1500 students from years 7‚Äì12, with an official count of 1570 students in 2017. Since 2006, the current role of the Principal of the School has been held by Jeff Major. History Wavell State High School opened on 27 January 1959 under the leadership of the founding Principal, C.E. Anstey. As the suburb of the school, Wavell Heights, which was named in 1942, Wavell State High School was named after Field Marshal Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell (5 May 1883 ‚Äì 24 May 1950), a Commander-in-Chief of British and Dominion Forces in the Middle East from July 1939 to July 1941. Many Australians served under his command during the early period of World War II; mostly in North Africa, Greece, Crete and Syria. In 2018 many of the original buildings received State Government Heritage Listing due to their cultural and historical significance. Sporting houses Wavell State High School's four sporting houses, Alamein, Burma, Keren and Tobruk, are named in reference to places and battles associated with Earl Wavell: * Alamein commemorates the Second Battle of El Alamein, the turning point of World War II in the Middle East. After two frustrating years of successes followed by reverses, British and Dominion forces led by Lt. General Bernard Montgomery successfully fought this decisive battle from 23 October to 4 November 1942 near El Alamein, in Northern Egypt, not far from Alexandria and Cairo. The Australian Ninth Division had an important role in the battle. The German and Italian Armies subsequently retreated to Tunis where they surrendered in May 1943. * Burma, part of Wavell's responsibilities as Commander-in-Chief of the south-West Pacific, was invaded in December 1941 by the Japanese Army who gained control of the country by May 1942. This occupation posed threats for India and Ceylon and severed the Chinese nationalists' main line of communication with the outside world via the port of Rangoon. Allied policy was that Germany should be defeated before Japan and only limited resources were available to assist Wavell and his successors. However, operations by soldiers known as Chindits were organised behind enemy lines during Wavell's time as Commander-in-Chief. Australian Air Force and Navy personnel were among those Allied forces who retook Burma in 1945. * Keren was the location of a decisive and bitter battle from 15 to 26 March 1941 in which British troops defeated Italian troops, paving the way for British control of East Africa and thereby removing some of the threat posed by the Axis powers to British interests in the Mediterranean. British success in March followed an earlier unsuccessful attempt to secure the area in a battle from 3 to 13 February. The town of Keren is located in a mountain area in the north of Eritrea, near the Red Sea. At the time, Eritrea was one of the six provinces of Italian East Africa. * Tobruk was the scene of a siege in which allied servicemen defended the town against the German Army from 10 April to 7 December 1941. This siege of 242 days is the longest in British Military history. The defenders, who were outnumbered ten to three, included Australians of the Ninth Division and a Brigade of the Seventh Division, as well as troops from Britain, India and Poland. By holding this strategic port in Libya the Allies were able to thwart the progress of the German Armies in their quest to control Egypt and the Suez Canal. The Rats of Tobruk Association, survivors of the siege, donated a debating trophy which is presented each year at Wavell State High School's Wavell Speech Night.

The gang was first organized by Jack Taylor, a notorious outlaw with expert skills in train robbery. This brought the gang to the attention of later famed Railroad Detective Jeff Milton, and Cochise County, Arizona Sheriff John Slaughter, under whom Milton was at that time working as a Deputy Sheriff. The gang built a reputation for being particularly cruel, and quick to shoot when confronted, and were wanted mainly for the murder of a train engineer in Sonora, and another train robbery in which they killed four passengers. In 1887, Sheriff Slaughter received information that several members of the gang were hiding out at the rural home of Flora Cardenas.Alton Pryor, The Lawmen, Roseville, California: Stagecoach Publishing, 2006, pp. 95-97 However, by the time Slaughter and his posse had reached her house, the gang members, identified as Geronimo Miranda, Manuel Robles, Nieves Deron and Fred Federico, had fled. Sheriff Slaughter and Jeff Milton tracked them to Contention City, Arizona, to the home of wood cutter Guadeloupe Robles, brother to Manuel Robles. Gang members Nieves Deron and Manuel Robles were hiding there, and without warning Sheriff Slaughter, Milton, and his deputies stormed the house. Guadeloupe Robles was shot dead by Slaughter, while Nieves Deron opened fire on Slaughter and his posse, with one bullet grazing Slaughter's ear lobe. The two gang members fled toward the rocks near the house, exchanging fire with the posse as they ran. Slaughter and two of his deputies shot and killed Deron, and shot and wounded Manuel Robles, who, though wounded, escaped into a thicket. During that same month, gang leader Jack Taylor was captured in Mexico by the Mexican Rurales, and sentenced to life in prison. The remaining members of the gang, Manuel Robles, Geronimo Miranda and Fred Federico, were still at large. Robles had yet to fully recover from his gunshot wounds suffered in Contention City, and this was being hindered by his having to remain constantly on the move. Robles and Miranda were shot and killed during a gun battle with the Mexican Rurales in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains later in 1887. On August 12, 1888, gang member Fred Federico mistook Deputy Sheriff Cesario Lucero for Sheriff Slaughter, in a planned ambush. Federico shot and killed Deputy Lucero, and was captured shortly thereafter. He was hanged, and was the last of the Jack Taylor Gang.

It was first performed at Covent Garden Theatre, London, on 25 January 1745. The anonymous libretto (possibly the work of the composer or Henry Carey) is based on Richard Leveridge's The Comickal Masque of Pyramus and Thisbe (1716), itself inspired by the \\"play within a play\\" in act 5 of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. This was the last of Lampe's operas, and was a much-needed success after a difficult period for musicians in the London theatre. In 1741 the revolution in Shakespearean acting initiated by Macklin and Garrick diverted attention away from music, and Lampe produced no new work in the major theatres for four years. Pyramus returns to the vein of burlesque that he mined in The Dragon of Wantley (1737), his first popular success; it ridicules Italian-style opera and opera singers rather than Shakespeare's plays and players. The onstage audience, originally Duke Theseus and his entourage, consists of Mr Semibrief (the impresario) and two gentlemen, one of whom has experienced Italian opera at first hand on the grand tour; they interject facetious spoken comments as the all-sung opera proceeds. The story follows Shakespeare closely: the Wall (tenor) sports a chink through which Pyramus (tenor) and Thisbe (soprano) arrange to meet 'at Ninny's tomb'. Thisbe arrives first and is frightened away by the Lion (bass), who sings a splendid roaring aria. After the Moon (tenor) has sung a lyrical Arne-like number, Pyramus appears, fears the worst and stabs himself 'like a hero in Italian opera, to very good time and tune'; Thisbe follows suit. But they are revived by Mr Semibrief in time to sing the epilogue. Lampe's music is charming and largely deadpan, though there are the standard Handelian rage and revenge arias. The full score (London, 1745/ R 1988) omits the secco recitatives, a dance and the last chorus.

Family and Early life  Karl Joseph von Bachmann was born in an aristocratic Swiss family from Nafels. His father Karl Leonhard von Bachmann, was a Mar√©chal de camp ([brigadier general) and his brother, Niklaus Franz von Bachmann, was a future general. As had many of his ancestors and relatives he entered the service of the French crown as an officer of Swiss mercenaries in France. Military career in France In 1749 Bachmann entered French service as a cadet. He was soon promoted to Ensign in the company of his father (in the Regiment de Castella) and in 1750 was promoted to Captain of the Grenadiers of the same regiment. In 1756 he became commander of two companies of the Regiment. In 1762 he was promoted to Major of the Regiment Waldner von Freudenstein. During this period he fought in various engagements of the Seven Years' War. In 1764 Bachmann became Lieutenant Colonel and was transferred to the Regiment of the Swiss Guard, where he kept his rank though officially he was Major of the Regiment. In 1768 he obtained the rank of Brigadier and in 1780 that of Marechal de Camp, while still serving as Major of the Swiss Guards. In 1778 Bachmann received the Royal and Military Order of Saint Louis. In 1792 he became also the owner of a company of the Swiss Guard Regiment. Death Major Bachmann was in direct charge of the 900 Swiss Guards present during the 10 August Insurrection, when revolutionaries stormed the palace of the Tuileries. The nominal commander of the Guard, the elderly Colonel d'Affrey, was in poor health and had delegated Bachmann to bring the regiment into central Paris during the evening of 9 August.Jerome Bodin, page 259, \\"Les Suisses au Service de la France\\", Having deployed his Swiss to defend the palace Major Bachmann escorted King Louis XVI and the Royal Family to the National Assembly, where they sought refuge. For reasons that are not clear, Bachmann did not give any instructions to his subordinates left behind in the Tuileries. About 650 Swiss Guards were subsequently killed, either during the fighting which broke out spontaneously shortly afterwards, or massacred after surrender. Arrested by the revolutionaries, Major Bachmann was accused of treason for ordering the Swiss Guard to resist the storming of the royal palace and thereby offending the \\"Majesty of the People\\". Bachmann refused to acknowledge the tribunal which was trying him, as the Swiss soldiers in French service were entitled to be tried by their own courts. His trial was interrupted in the late afternoon of 2 September 1792 when the September Massacres of hundreds of political prisoners took place at the Conciergerie and Abbaye prisons. A mob invaded the courtroom where Major Bachmann and other Swiss Guards were being tried before the official Tribunal of 17 August. The crowd retreated when ordered to clear the room by the presiding judges and Bachmann \\"passed through their shambles unharmed on his way to the scaffold\\". Bachmann was then formally sentenced to death, and guillotined on 3 September 1792. He stepped onto the scaffold still wearing the red coat of the Swiss Guard.Jerome Bodin, page 259, \\"Les Suisses au Service de la France\\",  The Dying Lion in Lucerne  Bachmann's name is also engraved on the monument of the Dying Lion in Lucerne, by Bertel Thorvaldsen, where he figures as second on the list of the fallen.

Designed to improve on the Renard Epervier, which was never adopted by the Belgian government, the prototype R.36 first flew on 5 November 1937. Following testing the R.36 was selected by the Belgian Air Force in late 1938, with 40 aircraft provisionally ordered, to be delivered in two years. However, on 17 January 1939 the prototype, OO-ARW, crashed near Nivelles, killing pilot Lt. Viscount Eric de Spoelberch. The official investigation was inconclusive, no evidence of material failure being discovered, with the most probable causes being radio equipment coming loose during a high-G manoeuvre, jamming the controls, or the pilot becoming incapacitated. The airframe had accumulated 75:30 hours' flight time. The order was then dropped in favour of licence production of the Hawker Hurricane by SABCA.

He also relates stories of his parents, who fled from Russia in 1914, his experiences at school and a brief flirtation with Communism.

Taylor) that was held at New York University‚Äôs Grey Art Gallery and Fales Library. The exhibition examined the rich cross-section of artists and activities that coexisted and often overlapped in Lower Manhattan between 1974 and 1984. Emerging out of the deflated optimism of the Summer of Love (and energized by the enactment of the loft laws that made it legal for artists to live in downtown New York's industrial spaces) the Downtown no wave scene attracted painters, sculptors, photographers, musicians, performance art, filmmakers, and writers who could afford the then-low rent lofts and Lower East Side tenement apartments. The Downtown Show: the New York Art Scene from 1974 to 1984 show traveled to the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (May 20 to September 3, 2006) and the Austin Museum of Art, in Austin, Texas (November 18, 2006, to January 28, 2007). It was chosen as first place winner by the International Association of Art Critics/USA (AICA USA) for best thematic show in New York City in 2005-2006.  Other curatorial activities  McCormick has also curated shows for the Bronx Museum of Art, the Queens Museum of Art and the Woodstock Center for Photography, and collaborated with The Museum of Sex on their exhibition Punk Lust: Raw Provocation 1971-1985, featuring visuals chronicling the emergence of punk subculture and punk music.PUNK LUST: RAW PROVOCATION 1971-1985 Carlo McCormick picks the 10 pieces that cemented the radical legacy of a game-changing art scene ReferencesFurther reading *Carlo McCormick, The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974‚Äì1984, Princeton University Press, 2006 *Grace Glueck, The Downtown Scene\\", When It Was Still Dirty, The New York Times, January 13, 2006 *Jo√£o Ribas, Artinfo,Carlo McCormick, January 23, 2006 *Carlo McCormick & Walter Robinson, (1982) Slouching Toward Avenue D, Art in America *Mairi Beautyman, AICA Announces Best Exhibitions of 2005-2006 Season, Interior Design, January 11, 2007 External links * Carlo McCormick interview published on March 4, 2019 by New York Said Podcast * Carlo McCormick at MoMA on KAWS and his art collection * Carlo McCormick ARTE Interview concerning the history of graffiti artists in New York City American art critics American art historians Living people Cultural historians Place of birth missing (living people) Year of birth missing (living people) Postmodernists American academics American art curators ","title":"Carlo McCormick"},{"id":"18615498","text":"≈ªulin is a village in the administrative district of Gmina ≈Åopiennik G√≥rny, within Krasnystaw County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland.

Steps  The usual four steps of homology modeling are executed: # search for a template (similar sequence of known structure), # align query and template sequences, # build the 3D model using the last alignment and the structure of the template and # assess the final 3D model. = Template selection = The template is the first PDB hit found by using maximum four PSI-BLAST iterations in the NCBI nr data bank.

Different multiple sequence alignments are built using different alignment programs on two sets of sequences including the query and the template sequence. The consensus method is using a neural network to find the best aligned residues and analyzing all possible combinations using a dead end elimination algorithm. = Model generation and loop modeling = The final 3D model is built from the target-template alignment and the 3D structure of the template using MODELLER.

Another issue was that priority for the Hispano-Suiza engines which powered the 530 was being given to the S.E.5a. In 1918, a second 530 was fitted with a 200 hp (150 kW) Sunbeam Arab engine, but development was subsequently abandoned.

C-3 was built by Sociedad Espa√±ola de Construcci√≥n Naval (SECN) in Cartagena, Spain, launched 20 February 1929, and commissioned on 4 May 1929. She took part in the Spanish Civil War on the government side before being sunk by the on 12 December 1936.  Pre-war  On 14 September 1931, C-3 successfully tested G√©nova's submarine rescue chamber (similar to the McCann Submarine Rescue Chamber) in Escombreras inlet. Developed by Capit√°n de Corbeta (Lieutenant Commander) Arturo G√©nova Torrecuellar, this was subsequently installed in all C-class submarines as a portable unit, as well as the subsequent D-class, El ascensor submarino G√©nova y el C-3 (Genova submarine Rescue Chamber and C-3) which used a fixed unit.  Civil War  At the start of the Civil War, 18 July 1936, C-3 was in Cartagena harbour, under command of Teniente de Nav√≠o (Lieutenant) Rafael Viniegra Gonz√°lez. He was ordered to sortie from Cartagena in company with submarines B-6, Isaac Peral (C-1), C-4 and C-6, bound for the Gibraltar Strait. In command of the flotilla was the Capit√°n de Fragata (Commander) Francisco Guimer√° Bosch, the mission was to blockade the strait and interdict transport of rebel troops from North Africa to the Iberian Peninsula. They took a patrol line along the Andalusian coast Only two days into the operation, on 20 July, the flotilla entered M√°laga harbour, where Guimer√°, Viniegra (along with C-3's executive officer), and the rest of the flotilla's senior officers, with the exception of Isaac Peral (C-1)'s skipper, Capit√°n de Corbeta Lara, were relieved and transferred to the prison ship Monte Toro because they were considered sympathizers of the rebels. Next morning, 21 July, C-3, joined by B-6, departed M√°laga bound for Tangier to protect the oil tanker Ophir. On 27 July, all destroyers and submarines in M√°laga deployed around Cadiz to intercept a Nationalist convoy that proved to be a decoy. Then she, C-2, and C-6 received instructions to form a patrol arc in front of Ceuta harbour to prevent the entrance of the cruiser Almirante Cervera, which had left Ferrol bound for the Gibraltar Strait. 1 August, at M√°laga, C-3 took on remaining anti-aircraft ammunition and torpedoes before C-4 departed for Cartagena for minor repairs Two weeks later, on 15 August, C-3 sailed for the Cantabric Sea with the C-6, returned to Cartagena with average. She repeated the voyage 25 August, in company with C-4 and C-5, where C-3 and C-6 jointly attempted to locate and sink the battleship Espa√±a and Almirante Cervera, without success. She also aided in the search for transports bringing weapons to Bilbao. C-3 returned to the Mediterranean Sea on 2 October, arriving in M√°laga 8 October. On 12 December 1936, C-3 was running surfaced 4 nm (7¬Ω km) southeast of M√°laga. In the conning tower was her commander, Alf√©rez de Nav√≠o (Ensign) Antonio Arbona Pastor, and a merchant navy pilot attached to the Republican Navy. At 14:19, there was a sudden explosion on her starboard bow, and C-3 disappeared. The explosion was observed by the coastguard vessel Xauen, lying two miles (3.7 km) inshore of C-3, and the fishing boats Joven Antonio and Joven Amalia, about the same distance away. Despite their proximity, the only survivors were the pilot, Garc√≠a Vi√±as, and two of C-3's sailors, Isidoro de la Orden Ib√°√±ez and Asensio Lid√≥n Jim√©nez, who had been topside dumping trash and garbage. According to the Germans, C-3 was torpedoed by , commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Harald Grosse, as part of Operation Ursula;'Operaci√≥n √örsula' reflota la historia real del submarino C3 (Operaci√≥n Ursula, refloaded the real history of C-3 submarine)' the Republican version differs, claiming that the Spanish boat sank after an internal explosion. For this action, Grosse received the \\"Goldenes Spanienkreuz\\" (Spanish golden cross). Over the next few days, Republican authorities attempted to locate C-3, but only found a large oil slick. The position was marked by buoy, but no rescue attempted, and it is likely there were none left alive aboard. Subsequently, when M√°laga fell to the Nationalists, C-3 was forgotten. The Nationalists, in an attempt to conceal the acquisition of two Italian Archimede-class submarines‚ÄîGeneral Mola (ex-) and General Sanjurjo, ex-)‚Äîrenamed them C-3 and C-5, claiming C-3 was raised and recommissioned by the Nationalist Navy. This maneuver was unsuccessful; the Italian boats bore distinct structural differences. C-3 was stricken by ministerial order on 31 July 1941.  Wreck found  In 1997, M√°laga's lawyer Antonio Checa discovered the remains of a shipwreck, He sensed it was C-3. Despite several dives by an ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) with video camera, it proved impossible to positively identify the wreck, owing to bad visibility. In October 1998, The Spanish Navy sent the rescue ship Mar Rojo (A-20 ) with a navy dive team. They identified wreck as C-3, at the position . They found her hull had broken in two. One section eight meters from bow was separated from the rest. Both parts remain in a sand plain, separated by a few meters, the biggest upright, the smaller inverted.

Similar Unified Model suites with global and regional domains are used by many other national or military weather agencies around the world for operational forecasting.

All of the models use varying resolutions of topography with greater accuracy at higher resolutions. The limiting factor with all models is that for a weather event to be recorded by the model it must be at least three grid points in size. Thus for the global model at 40 km, a weather system must be at least 120 km to be modelled. This means smaller phenomena such as small depressions, smaller hurricanes and large thunderstorms are too small for the model to catch them. As the resolution increases smaller events can be caught, the 1.5 km model for example, is reputedly capable of modelling individual showers. =Global Model= Approximately 16 km resolution with 70 vertical levels.Atmospheric numerical model configurations as of early 2010.

Charlotte Caroline Richardson was one of the results. The Ladies' Diary: or, Woman's Almanack appeared annually in London from 1704 to 1841 after which it was succeeded by The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary. It featured material relating to calendars etc. including sunrise and sunset times and phases of the moon, as well as important dates (eclipses, holidays, school terms, etc.), and a chronology of remarkable events. The subtitle indicated its serious purpose: \\"Containing New Improvements in ARTS and SCIENCES, and many entertaining PARTICULARS: Designed for the USE AND DIVERSION OF THE FAIR SEX.\\" These included riddles (called enigmas), rebuses, charades, scientific queries, and mathematical questions. A typical volume in the series included answers submitted by readers to problems posed the previous year and a set of new problems, nearly all proposed by readers. Both puzzle and answer (revealed the following year) were often in verse. Each cover featured a picture of a prominent English woman. Sometimes the subtitles were even more specific. For example, in 1836 the full title was The Ladies Diary, For the Year of Our Lord 1835, Being the Third After Bissextile. Designed specifically For the Amusement and Entertainment of The Fair Sex With An Appendix of Curious and Valuable Mathematical Papers For the Use of Students. The Hundred and Thirty Second Almanack Published of this Kind. Also The Gentleman's Diary Or, The Mathematical Repository; An Almanack For the Year of Our Lord 1835 and 1836 Being The Third or Bissextile or Leap Year Containing many Useful and entertaining Particulars peculiarly adapted to the Ingenious Gentleman engaged in the delightful Study and Practice of the Mathematics. The first editor and publisher, John Tipper, began the almanac by publishing a calendar, recipes, medicinal advice, stories and ended with \\"special rhyming riddles.\\" By the 1709 issue, the contents changed to exclude recipes, medicinal advice, and stories and include more puzzles from both Tipper and those sent in by readers. The second editor, Henry Beighton, took over the almanac after Tipper's death in 1713. He continued to publish the almanac rich in puzzles, and in 1720 began to include more difficult puzzles dealing with Newtonian infinitesimal calculus.

Only 30 minutes from Grevena and 20 minutes from Tsotyli, it is built with traditional architecture at an altitude of 860 meters. The stone houses give a special and impressive picture. History The exact establishment date is difficult to pinpoint due to lack of historical evidences. The older register is from the 1534 codex in the Monastery of Zaborda and gives the old name of the village which was Mirali, a name taken probably from the Turkish commander of the area, Omer Ali. At 1927 it was renamed Stroggylon (which means round) and in 1930 received its final name Chrysavgi (which means ‚Äúgolden dawn‚Äù) South of the village lay the stony remains of an ancient military settlement which was used to control the mountain passes. A copper statue of Athena was found in the area, along with metallic vessels, spearheads and daggers. Also Greek, Roman and Byzantine coins were unearthed by farmers. The first settlers, according to tradition, were located at \\"Selio\\" point, 2 kilometers north of the village. In the area were scattered settlements which were destroyed by Turkish and Albanian raids. The remaining people established the modern village. In 1793 many Voio villages were Islamized and became manors of the local Beys who were friendly to Ali Pasha. At Chrysavgi the Bey was Ali Koukos, to whom the residents paid the protective tax, one tenth of their production (Dekati). Beside the tax, they were bound to hand over to the Bey each new bride for him to spend the first wedding night with (Ius primae noctis). Some villagers were unable to tolerate this custom and killed the Bey in 1830. Next day was considered to be a \\"Golden Dawn\\" for the village. The remains of the Bey were discovered during an excavation in 1962, in \\"Koukos\\" point. The retaliation of the Turks for the murder of the Bey was a heavy tax enforced on the village. With this money, a mosque was built in Constantinople (Istanbul) which was named \\"Mirali Tzamisi\\". Chrysavgi and the other villages ceased to be manors in 1836 after a firman from Sultan Mahmud II.

He is notable in that he won both the Auckland Pacing Cup and two New Zealand Trotting Cups. These races are the richest harness races in New Zealand.Harness Racing - Complete Race History of the New Zealand Trotting Cup He was victorious in every harness racing state of Australia and New Zealand and earned over $2,000,000 during his racing career. Breeding John Campbell bred Flashing Red who was by his stallion Echelon (US1.50.6, 32 wins, $558,568) and he was the last foal of his dam the unraced Courvy Kazi by Courvoisier. Echelon sired 107 winners during six seasons at stud. Flashing Red was inbred to Meadow Skipper in the third and fourth generations (3f x 4f). Eric Blomquist, a Tasmanian owner-trainer purchased Flashing Red privately as a yearling. Racing career Flashing Red was a winner as a two- year-old for Blomquist and was second in the Tasmanian Metro Stakes and third in the Tasmanian Golden Slipper. He won 16 races from 60 starts for Blomquist including the Danbury Park Cup, the 2002 and 2003 Hobart Free For All, plus the $25,000 Devonport Cup by the end of his five-year-old campaign. Barrie Rattray then purchased Flashing Red for $20,000 and sold him afterwards to Stuart Hunter and Norm Jenkins for $40,000. His new owners were hoping that he would be successful in Queensland racing. Flashing Red confirmed their hopes in 2004 by winning the $50,000 Cordina Sprint at Harold Park, Group 2 (G2) Queensland Winter Cup at Albion Park, pacing the 2,680 metres in 1.57.4 mile rate, and the (G2) Albion Park Winter Cup. In 2005 Flashing Red won the $105,000 Ballarat Pacing Cup when he defeated Sokyola, and the listed South Australian Barastoc Cup (Clipsal Cup) and also finished second in the South Australia Cup to Young Rufus.

In 2007 he won the New Zealand Cup (for the second time) running a NZ record time over the 3,200 metres and Auckland Cup and was second in the Tooheys Mile to Hexus. Despite being trained in Australia for most of his career, his greatest achievements came in staying races on the larger tracks in New Zealand, where he won the New Zealand Trotting Cup as a nine-year-old and 10-year-old, in 2006 and 2007. He also won the 2007 Auckland Cup and the 2006/07 New Zealand Horse of the Year and Australasian Pacers Grand Circuit titles. Stud record Flashing Red was retired to stand at Roydon Lodge Stud, Wellington, N.Z. at a service fee of $1,500 plus GST. He was inducted into the Queensland Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 2008.

She was later transferred to the French Navy as Luciole. She was stricken from the French Navy and sold to Malaysian owners, but her fate beyond that is unreported in secondary sources.  Career  Sandalwood (YN-27) was laid down on 18 October 1940 by the American Shipbuilding Company, Lorain, Ohio; launched on 6 March 1941; sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Wallace; delivered on 24 October 1941; and placed in service on 25 October 1941. Following transit of the St. Lawrence River, Sandalwood proceeded down the U.S. East Coast to Norfolk, Virginia, where she remained, conducting net operations and performing occasional patrol or salvage duties, into 1944. Then, redesignated AN-32, effective 22 January, and commissioned on 1 June, she prepared for overseas duty. On 1 October, Sandalwood was detached from the 5th Naval District. Two weeks later, in the Panama Canal Zone, she reported to CinCPac and continued on to California and Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 25 November. She remained in the Hawaiian area into 1945; and, in late February, got underway for the Marshall Islands. At Eniwetok by mid-March, she conducted net operations there through the end of World War II. On 24 November, she steamed east, arrived at San Pedro, California, in early January 1946; and, four months later, moved north to Astoria, Oregon, for inactivation. Decommissioned on 13 August, Sandalwood was laid up with the Pacific Reserve Fleet, initially at Bremerton, Washington, and later at Stockton, California. In 1962, she was transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay. Five years later, she was returned to the Navy and sold to the government of France. Transferred in September 1967, she served as Luciole until sold by the French government.

He was the Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland from 2005-16. Biography Nelson grew up on a family farm in the town land of Listullycurran, Dromore, County Down. He went on to study at Wallace High School and then to Queen's University Belfast and attained his Bachelor of Laws in 1981. He set up his own law practice two years after graduation. He joined the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) while studying at Queen's University Belfast in 1977 and rose to the rank of Lieutenant. One such incident that led him to joining the Security Forces was on 7 April 1976, when three members of the Herron family from Dromore were murdered by the IRA in their drapery store. William Herron, who was murdered along with his wife and daughter, was a member of a local Dromore Orange Lodge. The murder of the Herons encouraged Drew down the path of military service and eventually politics. It was one reason, of many, why he was so eager to serve his country and in later years to fight for the innocent victims of terrorism. He left the UDR on entering politics in 1989. He was a former District Master of Lower Iveagh District in County Down and a member of Listullycurran LOL 616, in which he served as Secretary until his death. He was also a member of the Royal Black Institution. In the 1992 general election, Nelson was selected by the South Down constituency of the Ulster Unionist Party to succeed Enoch Powell as parliamentary candidate. He lost to the incumbent, Social Democratic and Labour Party candidate Eddie McGrady by 6,000 votes.South Down. Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive.

In 1996, he was fourth on the UUP list for election to the Northern Ireland Forum in South Belfast1996 Forum Elections: Candidates in South Belfast. Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive. He supported John Taylor (now Lord Kilclooney) in his bid to replace James Molyneaux as Leader in 1995. In 2004, he left the UUP. The following year, he became Grand Secretary of the Orange Institution. During his period of office, Nelson was part of Orange delegations which met with senior political and civic figures, including successive British First Ministers and Secretary of States, United States ambassadors, Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny, former Irish President Mary McAleese, Se√°n Cardinal Brady, SDLP members, and others. Nelson held a keen interest in local history as well as interests in the plight of French Protestants, the Huguenots, and the Reformation. He was a keen traveler, being a regular visitor to France to trace the plight of the Huguenots, and other parts of Europe where there were once Protestant minorities persecuted for their faith. Death Nelson died on 10 October 2016, following a short illness, aged 60. Political stances In 1996, Nelson expressed support for the UUP ending or reforming its link with the Orange Order in an attempt to broaden its appeal, for which he was heckled.Cochrane, Feargal (2001).

It consists of the shortest wavelength electromagnetic waves and so imparts the highest photon energy. Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900 while studying radiation emitted by radium. In 1903, Ernest Rutherford named this radiation gamma rays based on their relatively strong penetration of matter; in 1900 he had already named two less penetrating types of decay radiation (discovered by Henri Becquerel) alpha rays and beta rays in ascending order of penetrating power. Gamma rays from radioactive decay are in the energy range from a few kiloelectronvolts (keV) to approximately 8 megaelectronvolts (~8 MeV), corresponding to the typical energy levels in nuclei with reasonably long lifetimes. The energy spectrum of gamma rays can be used to identify the decaying radionuclides using gamma spectroscopy. Very-high-energy gamma rays in the 100‚Äì1000 teraelectronvolt (TeV) range have been observed from sources such as the Cygnus X-3 microquasar. Natural sources of gamma rays originating on Earth are mostly as a result of radioactive decay and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. However, there are other rare natural sources, such as terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, which produce gamma rays from electron action upon the nucleus. Notable artificial sources of gamma rays include fission, such as that which occurs in nuclear reactors, and high energy physics experiments, such as neutral pion decay and nuclear fusion. Gamma rays and X-rays are both electromagnetic radiation, and since they overlap in the electromagnetic spectrum, the terminology varies between scientific disciplines. In some fields of physics, they are distinguished by their origin: Gamma rays are created by nuclear decay, while in the case of X-rays, the origin is outside the nucleus. In astrophysics, gamma rays are conventionally defined as having photon energies above 100 keV and are the subject of gamma ray astronomy, while radiation below 100 keV is classified as X-rays and is the subject of X-ray astronomy. This convention stems from the early man-made X-rays, which had energies only up to 100 keV, whereas many gamma rays could go to higher energies. A large fraction of astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere. Gamma rays are ionizing radiation and are thus biologically hazardous. Due to their high penetration power, they can damage bone marrow and internal organs. Unlike alpha and beta rays, they pass easily through the body and thus pose a formidable radiation protection challenge, requiring shielding made from dense materials such as lead or concrete. Gamma rays can not be reflected off a mirror and their wavelengths are so small that they will pass between atoms in a detector. This means that gamma ray detectors often contain densely packed diamonds. History of discovery The first gamma ray source to be discovered was the radioactive decay process called gamma decay. In this type of decay, an excited nucleus emits a gamma ray almost immediately upon formation.It is now understood that a nuclear isomeric transition, however, can produce inhibited gamma decay with a measurable and much longer half-life. Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from radium. Villard knew that his described radiation was more powerful than previously described types of rays from radium, which included beta rays, first noted as \\"radioactivity\\" by Henri Becquerel in 1896, and alpha rays, discovered as a less penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However, Villard did not consider naming them as a different fundamental type. See also: Later, in 1903, Villard's radiation was recognized as being of a type fundamentally different from previously named rays by Ernest Rutherford, who named Villard's rays \\"gamma rays\\" by analogy with the beta and alpha rays that Rutherford had differentiated in 1899.Rutherford named Œ≥ rays on page 177 of: E. Rutherford (1903) \\"The magnetic and electric deviation of the easily absorbed rays from radium\\", Philosophical Magazine, Series 6, vol. 5, no. 26, pages 177‚Äì187. The \\"rays\\" emitted by radioactive elements were named in order of their power to penetrate various materials, using the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha rays as the least penetrating, followed by beta rays, followed by gamma rays as the most penetrating. Rutherford also noted that gamma rays were not deflected (or at least, not deflected) by a magnetic field, another property making them unlike alpha and beta rays. Gamma rays were first thought to be particles with mass, like alpha and beta rays. Rutherford initially believed that they might be extremely fast beta particles, but their failure to be deflected by a magnetic field indicated that they had no charge. In 1914, gamma rays were observed to be reflected from crystal surfaces, proving that they were electromagnetic radiation. Rutherford and his co-worker Edward Andrade measured the wavelengths of gamma rays from radium, and found that they were similar to X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths and (thus) higher frequency. This was eventually recognized as giving them more energy per photon, as soon as the latter term became generally accepted. A gamma decay was then understood to usually emit a gamma photon. Sources This animation tracks several gamma rays through space and time, from their emission in the jet of a distant blazar to their arrival in Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT). Natural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally occurring radioisotopes such as potassium-40, and also as a secondary radiation from various atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. Some rare terrestrial natural sources that produce gamma rays that are not of a nuclear origin, are lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, which produce high energy emissions from natural high-energy voltages. Gamma rays are produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced. Such electrons produce secondary gamma rays by the mechanisms of bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation. A large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere. Notable artificial sources of gamma rays include fission, such as occurs in nuclear reactors, as well as high energy physics experiments, such as neutral pion decay and nuclear fusion. A sample of gamma ray-emitting material that is used for irradiating or imaging is known as a gamma source. It is also called a radioactive source, isotope source, or radiation source, though these more general terms also apply to alpha- and beta-emitting devices. Gamma sources are usually sealed to prevent radioactive contamination, and transported in heavy shielding. =Radioactive decay (gamma decay)= Gamma rays are produced during gamma decay, which normally occurs after other forms of decay occur, such as alpha or beta decay. A radioactive nucleus can decay by the emission of an or particle. The daughter nucleus that results is usually left in an excited state. It can then decay to a lower energy state by emitting a gamma ray photon, in a process called gamma decay. The emission of a gamma ray from an excited nucleus typically requires only 10‚àí12 seconds. Gamma decay may also follow nuclear reactions such as neutron capture, nuclear fission, or nuclear fusion. Gamma decay is also a mode of relaxation of many excited states of atomic nuclei following other types of radioactive decay, such as beta decay, so long as these states possess the necessary component of nuclear spin. When high-energy gamma rays, electrons, or protons bombard materials, the excited atoms emit characteristic \\"secondary\\" gamma rays, which are products of the creation of excited nuclear states in the bombarded atoms. Such transitions, a form of nuclear gamma fluorescence, form a topic in nuclear physics called gamma spectroscopy. Formation of fluorescent gamma rays are a rapid subtype of radioactive gamma decay. In certain cases, the excited nuclear state that follows the emission of a beta particle or other type of excitation, may be more stable than average, and is termed a metastable excited state, if its decay takes (at least) 100 to 1000 times longer than the average 10‚àí12 seconds. Such relatively long-lived excited nuclei are termed nuclear isomers, and their decays are termed isomeric transitions. Such nuclei have half-lifes that are more easily measurable, and rare nuclear isomers are able to stay in their excited state for minutes, hours, days, or occasionally far longer, before emitting a gamma ray. The process of isomeric transition is therefore similar to any gamma emission, but differs in that it involves the intermediate metastable excited state(s) of the nuclei. Metastable states are often characterized by high nuclear spin, requiring a change in spin of several units or more with gamma decay, instead of a single unit transition that occurs in only 10‚àí12 seconds. The rate of gamma decay is also slowed when the energy of excitation of the nucleus is small.Gamma decay review Accessed Sept. 29, 2014 An emitted gamma ray from any type of excited state may transfer its energy directly to any electrons, but most probably to one of the K shell electrons of the atom, causing it to be ejected from that atom, in a process generally termed the photoelectric effect (external gamma rays and ultraviolet rays may also cause this effect). The photoelectric effect should not be confused with the internal conversion process, in which a gamma ray photon is not produced as an intermediate particle (rather, a \\"virtual gamma ray\\" may be thought to mediate the process). Decay schemes Radioactive decay scheme of Gamma emission spectrum of cobalt-60 One example of gamma ray production due to radionuclide decay is the decay scheme for cobalt-60, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram. First, decays to excited by beta decay emission of an electron of 0.31 MeV. Then the excited decays to the ground state (see nuclear shell model) by emitting gamma rays in succession of 1.17 MeV followed by 1.33 MeV. This path is followed 99.88% of the time: :{ border=\\"0\\" - style=\\"height:2em;\\"  ‚Üí  +  +  +  + 1.17 MeV - style=\\"height:2em;\\"  ‚Üí      +  + 1.33 MeV } Another example is the alpha decay of to form ; which is followed by gamma emission. In some cases, the gamma emission spectrum of the daughter nucleus is quite simple, (e.g. /) while in other cases, such as with (/ and /), the gamma emission spectrum is complex, revealing that a series of nuclear energy levels exist. =Particle physics= Gamma rays are produced in many processes of particle physics. Typically, gamma rays are the products of neutral systems which decay through electromagnetic interactions (rather than a weak or strong interaction). For example, in an electron‚Äìpositron annihilation, the usual products are two gamma ray photons. If the annihilating electron and positron are at rest, each of the resulting gamma rays has an energy of ~ 511 keV and frequency of ~ . Similarly, a neutral pion most often decays into two photons. Many other hadrons and massive bosons also decay electromagnetically. High energy physics experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider, accordingly employ substantial radiation shielding. Because subatomic particles mostly have far shorter wavelengths than atomic nuclei, particle physics gamma rays are generally several orders of magnitude more energetic than nuclear decay gamma rays. Since gamma rays are at the top of the electromagnetic spectrum in terms of energy, all extremely high-energy photons are gamma rays; for example, a photon having the Planck energy would be a gamma ray. =Other sources= A few gamma rays in astronomy are known to arise from gamma decay (see discussion of SN1987A), but most do not. Photons from astrophysical sources that carry energy in the gamma radiation range are often explicitly called gamma-radiation. In addition to nuclear emissions, they are often produced by sub-atomic particle and particle-photon interactions. Those include electron-positron annihilation, neutral pion decay, bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation. The red dots show some of the ~500 terrestrial gamma-ray flashes daily detected by the Fermi Gamma- ray Space Telescope through 2010. Credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. Laboratory sources In October 2017, scientists from various European universities proposed a means for sources of GeV photons using lasers as exciters through a controlled interplay between the cascade and anomalous radiative trapping. Terrestrial thunderstorms Thunderstorms can produce a brief pulse of gamma radiation called a terrestrial gamma-ray flash. These gamma rays are thought to be produced by high intensity static electric fields accelerating electrons, which then produce gamma rays by bremsstrahlung as they collide with and are slowed by atoms in the atmosphere. Gamma rays up to 100 MeV can be emitted by terrestrial thunderstorms, and were discovered by space-borne observatories. This raises the possibility of health risks to passengers and crew on aircraft flying in or near thunderclouds. Solar flares The most effusive solar flares emit across the entire EM spectrum, including Œ≥-rays. The first confident observation occurred in 1972. Cosmic rays Extraterrestrial, high energy gamma rays include the gamma ray background produced when cosmic rays (either high speed electrons or protons) collide with ordinary matter, producing pair-production gamma rays at 511 keV. Alternatively, bremsstrahlung are produced at energies of tens of MeV or more when cosmic ray electrons interact with nuclei of sufficiently high atomic number (see gamma ray image of the Moon at the beginning of this article, for illustration). Image of entire sky in 100 MeV or greater gamma rays as seen by the EGRET instrument aboard the CGRO spacecraft. Bright spots within the galactic plane are pulsars while those above and below the plane are thought to be quasars. Pulsars and magnetars The gamma ray sky (see illustration at right) is dominated by the more common and longer-term production of gamma rays that emanate from pulsars within the Milky Way. Sources from the rest of the sky are mostly quasars. Pulsars are thought to be neutron stars with magnetic fields that produce focused beams of radiation, and are far less energetic, more common, and much nearer sources (typically seen only in our own galaxy) than are quasars or the rarer gamma-ray burst sources of gamma rays. Pulsars have relatively long-lived magnetic fields that produce focused beams of relativistic speed charged particles, which emit gamma rays (bremsstrahlung) when those strike gas or dust in their nearby medium, and are decelerated. This is a similar mechanism to the production of high-energy photons in megavoltage radiation therapy machines (see bremsstrahlung). Inverse Compton scattering, in which charged particles (usually electrons) impart energy to low-energy photons boosting them to higher energy photons. Such impacts of photons on relativistic charged particle beams is another possible mechanism of gamma ray production. Neutron stars with a very high magnetic field (magnetars), thought to produce astronomical soft gamma repeaters, are another relatively long-lived star- powered source of gamma radiation. Quasars and active galaxies More powerful gamma rays from very distant quasars and closer active galaxies are thought to have a gamma ray production source similar to a particle accelerator. High energy electrons produced by the quasar, and subjected to inverse Compton scattering, synchrotron radiation, or bremsstrahlung, are the likely source of the gamma rays from those objects. It is thought that a supermassive black hole at the center of such galaxies provides the power source that intermittently destroys stars and focuses the resulting charged particles into beams that emerge from their rotational poles. When those beams interact with gas, dust, and lower energy photons they produce X-rays and gamma rays. These sources are known to fluctuate with durations of a few weeks, suggesting their relatively small size (less than a few light-weeks across). Such sources of gamma and X-rays are the most commonly visible high intensity sources outside our galaxy. They shine not in bursts (see illustration), but relatively continuously when viewed with gamma ray telescopes. The power of a typical quasar is about 1040 watts, a small fraction of which is gamma radiation. Much of the rest is emitted as electromagnetic waves of all frequencies, including radio waves. A hypernova. Artist's illustration showing the life of a massive star as nuclear fusion converts lighter elements into heavier ones. When fusion no longer generates enough pressure to counteract gravity, the star rapidly collapses to form a black hole. Theoretically, energy may be released during the collapse along the axis of rotation to form a long duration gamma-ray burst. Gamma-ray bursts The most intense sources of gamma rays, are also the most intense sources of any type of electromagnetic radiation presently known. They are the \\"long duration burst\\" sources of gamma rays in astronomy (\\"long\\" in this context, meaning a few tens of seconds), and they are rare compared with the sources discussed above. By contrast, \\"short\\" gamma-ray bursts of two seconds or less, which are not associated with supernovae, are thought to produce gamma rays during the collision of pairs of neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole.2005 NASA announcement of first close study of a short gamma- ray burst. The so-called long-duration gamma-ray bursts produce a total energy output of about 1044 joules (as much energy as our Sun will produce in its entire life-time) but in a period of only 20 to 40 seconds. Gamma rays are approximately 50% of the total energy output. The leading hypotheses for the mechanism of production of these highest-known intensity beams of radiation, are inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation from high-energy charged particles. These processes occur as relativistic charged particles leave the region of the event horizon of a newly formed black hole created during supernova explosion. The beam of particles moving at relativistic speeds are focused for a few tens of seconds by the magnetic field of the exploding hypernova. The fusion explosion of the hypernova drives the energetics of the process. If the narrowly directed beam happens to be pointed toward the Earth, it shines at gamma ray frequencies with such intensity, that it can be detected even at distances of up to 10 billion light years, which is close to the edge of the visible universe. Properties=Penetration of matter= Alpha radiation consists of helium nuclei and is readily stopped by a sheet of paper. Beta radiation, consisting of electrons or positrons, is stopped by an aluminium plate, but gamma radiation requires shielding by dense material such as lead or concrete. Due to their penetrating nature, gamma rays require large amounts of shielding mass to reduce them to levels which are not harmful to living cells, in contrast to alpha particles, which can be stopped by paper or skin, and beta particles, which can be shielded by thin aluminium. Gamma rays are best absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers (Z) and high density, which contribute to the total stopping power. Because of this, a lead (high Z) shield is 20‚Äì30% better as a gamma shield than an equal mass of another low-Z shielding material, such as aluminium, concrete, water, or soil; lead's major advantage is not in lower weight, but rather its compactness due to its higher density. Protective clothing, goggles and respirators can protect from internal contact with or ingestion of alpha or beta emitting particles, but provide no protection from gamma radiation from external sources. The higher the energy of the gamma rays, the thicker the shielding made from the same shielding material is required. Materials for shielding gamma rays are typically measured by the thickness required to reduce the intensity of the gamma rays by one half (the half value layer or HVL). For example, gamma rays that require (0.4‚Ä≥) of lead to reduce their intensity by 50% will also have their intensity reduced in half by of granite rock, 6 cm (2¬Ω‚Ä≥) of concrete, or 9 cm (3¬Ω‚Ä≥) of packed soil. However, the mass of this much concrete or soil is only 20‚Äì30% greater than that of lead with the same absorption capability. Depleted uranium is used for shielding in portable gamma ray sources, but here the savings in weight over lead are larger, In a nuclear power plant, shielding can be provided by steel and concrete in the pressure and particle containment vessel, while water provides a radiation shielding of fuel rods during storage or transport into the reactor core. The loss of water or removal of a \\"hot\\" fuel assembly into the air would result in much higher radiation levels than when kept under water. =Matter interaction= The total absorption coefficient of aluminium (atomic number 13) for gamma rays, plotted versus gamma energy, and the contributions by the three effects. As is usual, the photoelectric effect is largest at low energies, Compton scattering dominates at intermediate energies, and pair production dominates at high energies. The total absorption coefficient of lead (atomic number 82) for gamma rays, plotted versus gamma energy, and the contributions by the three effects. Here, the photoelectric effect dominates at low energy. Above 5 MeV, pair production starts to dominate. When a gamma ray passes through matter, the probability for absorption is proportional to the thickness of the layer, the density of the material, and the absorption cross section of the material. The total absorption shows an exponential decrease of intensity with distance from the incident surface: :I(x)= I_0 \\\\cdot e ^{-\\\\mu x} where x is the thickness of the material from the incident surface, Œº= nœÉ is the absorption coefficient, measured in cm‚àí1, n the number of atoms per cm3 of the material (atomic density) and œÉ the absorption cross section in cm2. As it passes through matter, gamma radiation ionizes via three processes: the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and pair production. *Photoelectric effect: This describes the case in which a gamma photon interacts with and transfers its energy to an atomic electron, causing the ejection of that electron from the atom. The kinetic energy of the resulting photoelectron is equal to the energy of the incident gamma photon minus the energy that originally bound the electron to the atom (binding energy). The photoelectric effect is the dominant energy transfer mechanism for X-ray and gamma ray photons with energies below 50 keV (thousand electronvolts), but it is much less important at higher energies. *Compton scattering: This is an interaction in which an incident gamma photon loses enough energy to an atomic electron to cause its ejection, with the remainder of the original photon's energy emitted as a new, lower energy gamma photon whose emission direction is different from that of the incident gamma photon, hence the term \\"scattering\\". The probability of Compton scattering decreases with increasing photon energy. Compton scattering is thought to be the principal absorption mechanism for gamma rays in the intermediate energy range 100 keV to 10 MeV. Compton scattering is relatively independent of the atomic number of the absorbing material, which is why very dense materials like lead are only modestly better shields, on a per weight basis, than are less dense materials. *Pair production: This becomes possible with gamma energies exceeding 1.02 MeV, and becomes important as an absorption mechanism at energies over 5 MeV (see illustration at right, for lead). By interaction with the electric field of a nucleus, the energy of the incident photon is converted into the mass of an electron-positron pair. Any gamma energy in excess of the equivalent rest mass of the two particles (totaling at least 1.02 MeV) appears as the kinetic energy of the pair and in the recoil of the emitting nucleus. At the end of the positron's range, it combines with a free electron, and the two annihilate, and the entire mass of these two is then converted into two gamma photons of at least 0.51 MeV energy each (or higher according to the kinetic energy of the annihilated particles). The secondary electrons (and/or positrons) produced in any of these three processes frequently have enough energy to produce much ionization themselves. Additionally, gamma rays, particularly high energy ones, can interact with atomic nuclei resulting in ejection of particles in photodisintegration, or in some cases, even nuclear fission (photofission). =Light interaction= High-energy (from 80 GeV to ~10 TeV) gamma rays arriving from far-distant quasars are used to estimate the extragalactic background light in the universe: The highest-energy rays interact more readily with the background light photons and thus the density of the background light may be estimated by analyzing the incoming gamma ray spectra. =Gamma spectroscopy= Gamma spectroscopy is the study of the energetic transitions in atomic nuclei, which are generally associated with the absorption or emission of gamma rays. As in optical spectroscopy (see Franck‚ÄìCondon effect) the absorption of gamma rays by a nucleus is especially likely (i.e., peaks in a \\"resonance\\") when the energy of the gamma ray is the same as that of an energy transition in the nucleus. In the case of gamma rays, such a resonance is seen in the technique of M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy. In the M√∂ssbauer effect the narrow resonance absorption for nuclear gamma absorption can be successfully attained by physically immobilizing atomic nuclei in a crystal. The immobilization of nuclei at both ends of a gamma resonance interaction is required so that no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition. Such loss of energy causes gamma ray resonance absorption to fail. However, when emitted gamma rays carry essentially all of the energy of the atomic nuclear de-excitation that produces them, this energy is also sufficient to excite the same energy state in a second immobilized nucleus of the same type. Applications VACIS (vehicle and container imaging system) Gamma rays provide information about some of the most energetic phenomena in the universe; however, they are largely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. Instruments aboard high-altitude balloons and satellites missions, such as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, provide our only view of the universe in gamma rays. Gamma-induced molecular changes can also be used to alter the properties of semi-precious stones, and is often used to change white topaz into blue topaz. Non-contact industrial sensors commonly use sources of gamma radiation in refining, mining, chemicals, food, soaps and detergents, and pulp and paper industries, for the measurement of levels, density, and thicknesses. Gamma-ray sensors are also used for measuring the fluid levels in water and oil industries. Typically, these use Co-60 or Cs-137 isotopes as the radiation source. In the US, gamma ray detectors are beginning to be used as part of the Container Security Initiative (CSI). These machines are advertised to be able to scan 30 containers per hour. Gamma radiation is often used to kill living organisms, in a process called irradiation. Applications of this include the sterilization of medical equipment (as an alternative to autoclaves or chemical means), the removal of decay-causing bacteria from many foods and the prevention of the sprouting of fruit and vegetables to maintain freshness and flavor. Despite their cancer-causing properties, gamma rays are also used to treat some types of cancer, since the rays also kill cancer cells. In the procedure called gamma-knife surgery, multiple concentrated beams of gamma rays are directed to the growth in order to kill the cancerous cells. The beams are aimed from different angles to concentrate the radiation on the growth while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. Gamma rays are also used for diagnostic purposes in nuclear medicine in imaging techniques. A number of different gamma-emitting radioisotopes are used. For example, in a PET scan a radiolabeled sugar called fludeoxyglucose emits positrons that are annihilated by electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays that highlight cancer as the cancer often has a higher metabolic rate than the surrounding tissues. The most common gamma emitter used in medical applications is the nuclear isomer technetium-99m which emits gamma rays in the same energy range as diagnostic X-rays. When this radionuclide tracer is administered to a patient, a gamma camera can be used to form an image of the radioisotope's distribution by detecting the gamma radiation emitted (see also SPECT). Depending on which molecule has been labeled with the tracer, such techniques can be employed to diagnose a wide range of conditions (for example, the spread of cancer to the bones via bone scan). Health effects Gamma rays cause damage at a cellular level and are penetrating, causing diffuse damage throughout the body. However, they are less ionising than alpha or beta particles, which are less penetrating. Low levels of gamma rays cause a stochastic health risk, which for radiation dose assessment is defined as the probability of cancer induction and genetic damage.The ICRP says \\"In the low dose range, below about 100 mSv, it is scientifically plausible to assume that the incidence of cancer or heritable effects will rise in direct proportion to an increase in the equivalent dose in the relevant organs and tissues\\" ICRP publication 103 paragraph 64 High doses produce deterministic effects, which is the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen. These effects are compared to the physical quantity absorbed dose measured by the unit gray (Gy).ICRP report 103 para 104 and 105 =Body response= When gamma radiation breaks DNA molecules, a cell may be able to repair the damaged genetic material, within limits. However, a study of Rothkamm and Lobrich has shown that this repair process works well after high-dose exposure but is much slower in the case of a low-dose exposure. =Risk assessment= The natural outdoor exposure in the United Kingdom ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 ¬µSv/h with significant increase around known nuclear and contaminated sites.ENVIRONMENT AGENCY UK Radioactivity in Food and the Environment, 2012 Natural exposure to gamma rays is about 1 to 2 mSv per year, and the average total amount of radiation received in one year per inhabitant in the USA is 3.6 mSv.United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation Annex E: Medical radiation exposures ‚Äì Sources and Effects of Ionizing ‚Äì 1993, p. 249, New York, UN There is a small increase in the dose, due to naturally occurring gamma radiation, around small particles of high atomic number materials in the human body caused by the photoelectric effect. By comparison, the radiation dose from chest radiography (about 0.06 mSv) is a fraction of the annual naturally occurring background radiation dose.US National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements ‚Äì NCRP Report No. 93 ‚Äì pp 53‚Äì55, 1987. Bethesda, Maryland, USA, NCRP A chest CT delivers 5 to 8 mSv. A whole-body PET/CT scan can deliver 14 to 32 mSv depending on the protocol. The dose from fluoroscopy of the stomach is much higher, approximately 50 mSv (14 times the annual background). An acute full-body equivalent single exposure dose of 1 Sv (1000 mSv) causes slight blood changes, but 2.0‚Äì3.5 Sv (2.0‚Äì3.5 Gy) causes very severe syndrome of nausea, hair loss, and hemorrhaging, and will cause death in a sizable number of cases‚Äî-about 10% to 35% without medical treatment. A dose of 5 Sv\\"Lethal dose\\", NRC Glossary (October 18, 2011) (5 Gy) is considered approximately the LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of exposed population) for an acute exposure to radiation even with standard medical treatment. A dose higher than 5 Sv (5 Gy) brings an increasing chance of death above 50%. Above 7.5‚Äì10 Sv (7.5‚Äì10 Gy) to the entire body, even extraordinary treatment, such as bone-marrow transplants, will not prevent the death of the individual exposed (see radiation poisoning). (Doses much larger than this may, however, be delivered to selected parts of the body in the course of radiation therapy.) For low-dose exposure, for example among nuclear workers, who receive an average yearly radiation dose of 19 mSv, the risk of dying from cancer (excluding leukemia) increases by 2 percent. For a dose of 100 mSv, the risk increase is 10 percent. By comparison, risk of dying from cancer was increased by 32 percent for the survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Units of measurement and exposure The following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units: The measure of the ionizing effect of gamma and X-rays in dry air is called the exposure, for which a legacy unit, the r√∂ntgen was used from 1928. This has been replaced by kerma, now mainly used for instrument calibration purposes but not for received dose effect. The effect of gamma and other ionizing radiation on living tissue is more closely related to the amount of energy deposited in tissue rather than the ionisation of air, and replacement radiometric units and quantities for radiation protection have been defined and developed from 1953 onwards. These are: *The gray (Gy), is the SI unit of absorbed dose, which is the amount of radiation energy deposited in the irradiated material. For gamma radiation this is numerically equivalent to equivalent dose measured by the sievert, which indicates the stochastic biological effect of low levels of radiation on human tissue. The radiation weighting conversion factor from absorbed dose to equivalent dose is 1 for gamma, whereas alpha particles have a factor of 20, reflecting their greater ionising effect on tissue. *The rad is the deprecated CGS unit for absorbed dose and the rem is the deprecated CGS unit of equivalent dose, used mainly in the USA. Distinction from X-rays In practice, gamma ray energies overlap with the range of X-rays, especially in the higher-frequency region referred to as \\"hard\\" X-rays. This depiction follows the older convention of distinguishing by wavelength. The conventional distinction between X-rays and gamma rays has changed over time. Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes almost invariably had a longer wavelength than the radiation (gamma rays) emitted by radioactive nuclei. Older literature distinguished between X- and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength, with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10‚àí11 m, defined as gamma rays. Since the energy of photons is proportional to their frequency and inversely proportional to wavelength, this past distinction between X-rays and gamma rays can also be thought of in terms of its energy, with gamma rays considered to be higher energy electromagnetic radiation than are X-rays. However, since current artificial sources are now able to duplicate any electromagnetic radiation that originates in the nucleus, as well as far higher energies, the wavelengths characteristic of radioactive gamma ray sources vs. other types now completely overlap. Thus, gamma rays are now usually distinguished by their origin: X-rays are emitted by definition by electrons outside the nucleus, while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus. Exceptions to this convention occur in astronomy, where gamma decay is seen in the afterglow of certain supernovas, but radiation from high energy processes known to involve other radiation sources than radioactive decay is still classed as gamma radiation. The Moon as seen by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, in gamma rays of greater than 20 MeV. These are produced by cosmic ray bombardment of its surface. The Sun, which has no similar surface of high atomic number to act as target for cosmic rays, cannot usually be seen at all at these energies, which are too high to emerge from primary nuclear reactions, such as solar nuclear fusion (though occasionally the Sun produces gamma rays by cyclotron-type mechanisms, during solar flares). Gamma rays typically have higher energy than X-rays. For example, modern high-energy X-rays produced by linear accelerators for megavoltage treatment in cancer often have higher energy (4 to 25 MeV) than do most classical gamma rays produced by nuclear gamma decay. One of the most common gamma ray emitting isotopes used in diagnostic nuclear medicine, technetium-99m, produces gamma radiation of the same energy (140 keV) as that produced by diagnostic X-ray machines, but of significantly lower energy than therapeutic photons from linear particle accelerators. In the medical community today, the convention that radiation produced by nuclear decay is the only type referred to as \\"gamma\\" radiation is still respected. Due to this broad overlap in energy ranges, in physics the two types of electromagnetic radiation are now often defined by their origin: X-rays are emitted by electrons (either in orbitals outside of the nucleus, or while being accelerated to produce bremsstrahlung-type radiation),\\"Bremsstrahlung radiation\\" is \\"braking radiation\\", but \\"acceleration\\" is being used here in the specific sense of the deflection of an electron from its course: while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus or by means of other particle decays or annihilation events. There is no lower limit to the energy of photons produced by nuclear reactions, and thus ultraviolet or lower energy photons produced by these processes would also be defined as \\"gamma rays\\". The only naming- convention that is still universally respected is the rule that electromagnetic radiation that is known to be of atomic nuclear origin is always referred to as \\"gamma rays\\", and never as X-rays. However, in physics and astronomy, the converse convention (that all gamma rays are considered to be of nuclear origin) is frequently violated. In astronomy, higher energy gamma and X-rays are defined by energy, since the processes that produce them may be uncertain and photon energy, not origin, determines the required astronomical detectors needed. High-energy photons occur in nature that are known to be produced by processes other than nuclear decay but are still referred to as gamma radiation. An example is \\"gamma rays\\" from lightning discharges at 10 to 20 MeV, and known to be produced by the bremsstrahlung mechanism. Another example is gamma-ray bursts, now known to be produced from processes too powerful to involve simple collections of atoms undergoing radioactive decay. This is part and parcel of the general realization that many gamma rays produced in astronomical processes result not from radioactive decay or particle annihilation, but rather in non-radioactive processes similar to X-rays. Although the gamma rays of astronomy often come from non- radioactive events, a few gamma rays in astronomy are specifically known to originate from gamma decay of nuclei (as demonstrated by their spectra and emission half life). A classic example is that of supernova SN 1987A, which emits an \\"afterglow\\" of gamma-ray photons from the decay of newly made radioactive nickel-56 and cobalt-56. Most gamma rays in astronomy, however, arise by other mechanisms.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Urzƒôd√≥w. It lies in Lesser Poland, approximately north-west of Kra≈õnik and south-west of the regional capital Lublin. The town has a population of 1,060, and in 1405‚Äì1869 it had a status of a town, regained in 2016. Urzƒôd√≥w lies on the Urzƒôd√≥wka river, among the hills of the Lublin Upland. In the past, it used to be one of major urban centers of eastern Lesser Poland, placed on a merchant road from Krak√≥w to Lublin, and further on to Lithuania. The town was granted Magdeburg rights in 1405 by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, replacing two villages ‚Äì Zaborzyce and Skorczyce, which had existed in the location of Urzƒôd√≥w. In 1474 it became the seat of a county in Lublin Voivodeship, which in the same year was carved out of Sandomierz Voivodeship. Urzƒôd√≥w remained an important urban center of the area until the mid-17th century, when, after long-lasting conflicts with the Cossacks and the Swedes (see Deluge, Khmelnytsky Uprising) it was burned. Jewish History During the reign of King Augustus III (1733‚Äì1763) people living in Urzƒôd√≥w repeatedly complained to him about being oppressed by the Jews. In 1791 they demanded that starost Kazimierz Rzewuski should expel the remaining Jews from the town. In 1781 there were as few as 11 Jews in Urzƒôd√≥w (0.5% of the entire population). It was not until after 1862 that Urzƒôd√≥w started to receive a steady influx of Jews. At the end of the 19th century the Urzƒôd√≥w kehilla was formed. Though small, the Jewish community was active in social and economic life of the town. In 1889 there were 3.017 residents in Urzƒôd√≥w, out of whom 242 (8%) were Jewish. In 1900 it was inhabited by 3,620 people, including 303 Jews (8.37%). Before the outbreak of World War II about 40 Jewish families lived in Urzƒôd√≥w (i.e., about 300 people). During the war, on September 23, 1939, German occupation authorities ordered that Jewish children be banned from state schools. Since January 5, 1940 the Jews had to wear a band with the Star of David on their left arms. In October 1942 Jews from Urzƒôd√≥w were transported to the Kra≈õnik ghetto and Budzy≈Ñ forced labor camp, which were just stopovers on their trip to Be≈Ç≈ºec gas chambers. During the Nazi occupation, 300 Jews from Urzƒôd√≥w were killed. The Jewish cemetery was plundered during World War II and afterwards. In 1993, local inhabitants arranged a matzevot-shaped plaque in memory of Urzƒôd√≥w Jews murdered by the Nazis from 1939-1944. In August 2012, it was discovered that the plaque was full of graffiti and the area is contaminated with broken bottles of alcohol and rubbish.

Personal life McEachern was born in Albury, New South Wales, the sixth of 13 children of Archibald Hector McEachern and his wife, Rebecca Mary. On 2 February 1916, McEachern married pianist Hazel Hogarth Doyle, who later became his accompanist and provided the musical direction for his career. He was a Freemason, and a member of the Savage Club Lodge in London.See \\"distinguished members\\" on the Savage Club Lodge website. Career and death During World War I, McEachern went on a tour of Australia with the great Australian soprano Nellie Melba. Also in the touring company were Ella Caspers, Ada Crossley and Marie Narelle. In 1921 McEachern went to England with his wife, where he was hailed as one of the world's best bass vocalists. He was especially acclaimed as an oratorio singer although his voice was equally well suited to the demands of opera; but unlike his finest contemporary rival among English-language basses, Norman Allin, he elected not to pursue a career in that particular art form. McEachern did appear, however, in an array of staged Gilbert and Sullivan Savoy operettas under the batons of the famous conductors Sir Henry Wood and Sir John Barbirolli. In early 1926, McEachern forged a light-entertainment collaboration with Bentley Collingwood Hilliam, a pianist from Yorkshire. Their act proved to be a great success with British audiences and they became famous as Mr. Flotsam and Mr. Jetsam.Entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography McEachern was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus and died after an operation in London on 17 January 1945. His name is commemorated in Australia by McEachern Crescent in the Canberra suburb of Melba. Recordings McEachern made a total of 187 studio recordings, including pieces of music from opera, operetta and oratorio as well as a number of popular songs of the day. These records display the impressive depth, power and tonal richness of his voice and the excellence of his technique. One of his English-language 78-rpm discs, made with his countryman Harold Williams, of \\"The Gendarmes' Duet\\" from Jacques Offenbach's Genevi√®ve de Brabant, is considered to be a classic recording. Produced in 1933, it has been re-issued many times since and is available on CD.

The film is an early jukebox musical featuring performances by established rock and roll singers of the era, including Chuck Berry, LaVern Baker, Teddy Randazzo, the Moonglows, the Flamingos, and the Teenagers with Frankie Lymon as lead singer. Later West Side Story cast member David Winters is also featured. Famed disc jockey Alan Freed made an appearance as himself. The movie has a fairly simple plot: teenage girl Dori Graham (played by then 13-year-old Tuesday Weld, with a credited Connie Francis dubbed in as Dori's singing voice) can't persuade her dad to buy her a strapless gown and has to get the money together herself in time for the prom. Jack Collins plays the frustrated dad. Valerie Harper made her debut in a brief appearance as an extra seated at the center table during the performance of \\"Ever Since I Can Remember\\" by Cirino and the Bowties and can be seen after the performance of Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers. This was also Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers' film debut. Almost every member of the cast was signed to a record label at the time, which was credited along with each star. In 1984, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.

He played hurling with his local club Buffer's Alley and with the Wexford senior inter-county team from 1984 until 2000. Playing career=Club= Dempsey played his club hurling with the famous Buffer's Alley GAA club and enjoyed much success. He first came to prominence on the club's senior team in the early 1980s as the team was in the middle of completing a four in-a-row of county championship titles between 1982 and 1985. This last county title was later converted into a Leinster club title for Dempsey, but his side was beaten by Kilruane MacDonagh's of Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. 1988 saw Dempsey won another county title before later adding a second Leinster club medal to his collection. Once again Buffer's Alley reached the All-Ireland final, this time with O‚ÄôDonovan Rossa of Antrim providing the opposition. Victory went to the Wexford men by 2-12 to 0-12, giving Dempsey an All-Ireland club medal. He won another set of county medals in 1989 and 1991 before collecting a third Leinster club medal in the latter year. His side was later defeated by Sarsfield's of Galway in the All-Ireland final. Dempsey finished off his career by winning a final county title in 1993. =Inter- county= Dempsey first came to prominence as a dual player at minor level. He played both hurling and Gaelic football for Wexford in the under-18 grade, but he enjoyed little success. Dempsey later joined the county under-21 hurling team. Here he won a Leinster title in 1986 following victory in a replay over Offaly. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Galway provide the opposition. Dempsey's side were completely outclassed on that occasion as Galway won by 1-14 to 2-5. By this stage Dempsey had already made his debut with the Wexford senior team, but it was not a happy time to be a Wexford hurler. The county had been pushed back into third place in the Leinster Championship behind Kilkenny and Offaly. Provincial final appearances in 1988 and 1992 brought nothing but defeat for Dempsey's team. In 1993 Dempsey was captain as Wexford looked set for glory when they reached the final of the National Hurling League. The opponents on that occasion were Cork; the game ended in a draw. The replay saw extra time being played, but both sides ended level once again. At the third attempt Cork emerged victorious by 3-11 to 1-12. In spite of this defeat expectations were still high for the Leinster championship. In the final of that competition Wexford drew with arch rivals and All-Ireland champions Kilkenny and there was hope of success. The replay was a different affair as Kilkenny won handily enough by 2-12 to 0-11. Wexford were defeated in the Leinster final again in 1994 before disappearing from the championship at the first hurdle in 1995. By 1996 things were beginning to change in Wexford, thanks in no small way to the new manager Liam Griffin. Once again Dempsey lined out in the Leinster final. Offaly provided the opposition on that occasion; history was made as Wexford won by 2-23 to 2-15. It was Demspey's first senior Leinster title and Wexford's first since 1977. Wexford later defeated Galway in the penultimate game of the championship, setting up an All-Ireland final meeting with Limerick. The Munster men were slight favourites going into the game. They were the beaten finalists of 1994 and had already beaten Clare, the reigning champions, in the Munster Championship. The game was far from a classic, though it did provide excitement. Dempsey was the hero of the day as he scored a goal after nineteen minutes to give Wexford a major advantage. His side led by 1-8 to 0-10 at half-time in spite of having √âamonn Scallon sent off. Wexford took a four-point lead in the second-half; this was whittled back to two points as Wexford hung on for the last twenty minutes. The final score of 1-13 to 0-14 showed how vital Dempsey's goal was. It was his first All-Ireland medal and Wexford's first since 1968. Dempsey was later honoured with an All-Star award. Dempsey captured a second Leinster medal in 1997 as Kilkenny fell in the provincial decider. 1997 saw the introduction of the so-called ‚Äòback-door‚Äô system whereby the defeated Munster and Leinster finalists were allowed back into the All-Ireland championship at the quarter-final stage. Because of this Wexford's opponents in the All- Ireland semi-final were Tipperary, the Munster runners-up. On that occasion Wexford were outclassed by Tipp who won by 2-16 to 0-15. The next few years saw Wexford defeated in the early stages of the provincial championship. Dempsey retired from inter-county hurling in 2000. =Provincial= Dempsey also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He won his sole Railway Cup medal in 1993 as Leinster defeated Ulster.

Early history In 1897 the grounds were converted from a lake to a playing field. At one time it was the site for carnivals, games circuses and gymkhana activities and even an execution ground during the British occupation. A number of sporting clubs including Kandy Sports Club, Young's Stars SC, Young Wanders SC, Green Field SC and schools including St. Anthony's, Trinity College, Sri Rahula College, St. Paul's (now known as Sri Sumangala College), Dharmaraja College and Kingswood College used the venue to conduct cricket, football, rugby, hockey and athletics. Bogambara Stadium was not only used for sports, it was also used for folk sports including elle, bahu, thattu and gudu. Sports Bogambara Stadium serves as a venue for various sports ranging from Rugby, Football, Hockey, Athletics, Netball, Basketball, softball, and cricket. Stadium Development Inside of the stadium after redevelopment in 2015 Bogambara Stadium was renovated into a stadium in 1972, thanks to the Special Commissionership of M. B. Samarakoon, who initiated the renovation work with support from local politicians such as E. L. Senanayake, Noel Wimalasena, Shelton Ranaraja, and E. W. Balasuriya, a local sports promoter and philanthropist, who assisted in raising donations. In 1997 the Bogambara stadium was upgraded to an international standard stadium, at a cost of Rs. 89 million, with 75% of the funding coming from the Kandy District Sports Development Foundation, chaired by Anuruddha Ratwatte, the Deputy Minister of Defence. It was re-developed under the patronage of the municipal council and presently the Sports Ministry owns the premises. The ground fees are on the higher side and the less affluent football and hockey clubs are finding it difficult to keep the game alive.

TMA-01M was the 107th flight of a Soyuz spacecraft, and the first flight of the modernized TMA-M series. The spacecraft remained docked to the space station during Expedition 25, to serve as an emergency escape vehicle. The spacecraft's COSPAR ID was 2010-052A.  Crew  The Soyuz TMA-01M crew was confirmed by NASA on 21 November 2008. = Backup crew = Spacecraft  Soyuz TMA-01M is the first spacecraft of the new modernized Soyuz TMA-M series, developed and built by RKK Energia as an upgrade of the baseline Soyuz-TMA, which has been in use since 2002. 36 obsolete pieces of equipment have been replaced with 19 new- generation devices and the vehicle's total mass has been reduced by 70 kilograms (154 lbs). In particular, the old Argon-16Argon-16 Computer computer control system, which has been used on Soyuz ships for more than 30 years, has been replaced with a new digital onboard computer, the TsVM-101. Power consumption has been reduced throughout the ship. There are also changes to the spacecraft's structure, such as replacing the magnesium alloy used in the instrument module frame by aluminium alloy, to make the ship easier to manufacture. The modernized Soyuz ship will also enable engineers to test new equipment which may also be used in Russia's next generation crewed space ship that is currently under development. NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, part of Soyuz TMA-01M's crew, praised the ship's new displays, saying that they make flying easier and less operator intensive. Two flight development tests are planned: Soyuz TMA-01M and Soyuz TMA-02M. The third ship, Soyuz TMA-03M will be used for qualification tests. In addition to verifying the nominal operation of the spaceship, the testing will include verification of off-nominal modes, such as manual attitude control, issuing of orbital maneuvering pulses using four berthing and attitude thrusters, and flying around the ISS in manual control mode. After the launch of Soyuz TMA-01M, Russian space officials said the new spacecraft performed normally with no problems of any significance. \\"Soyuz TMA-01M is a digital spacecraft, digital vehicle. As you saw today, it worked extremely well, it was an automatic flight, 100 percent automatic,\\" said Vitaly Lopota, president RSC Energia.  Mission highlights = Launch = The spacecraft lifted off aboard a Soyuz-FG rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 23:10:55 UTC on Thursday, 7 October 2010 (5:10:55 AM Friday at local time). In 9 minutes, the vehicle reached low earth orbit with the following parameters: min altitude ‚Äì 199,85 km; max altitude ‚Äì 258,77 km; revolution ‚Äì 88,81 min; inclination‚Äì 51,63 degrees. Soon after the orbital insertion, the spacecraft unfolded its solar panels and antennas, and flight control gave the ship green light for starting its approach to the International Space Station. = Docking = The Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft linked up with the space station at 00:01 UTC on Sunday, 10 October 2010, precisely one minute ahead of schedule. Docking to the Poisk module occurred when both spacecraft were flying more than 220 miles (354 km) above the southern Pacific Ocean, just off the coast from Chile. A few moments later, hooks and latches engaged to pull the spacecraft firmly into place and after extensive leak checks, hatches were opened at 03:09 UTC. Soyuz TMA-01M lands near the town of Arkalyk in Kazakhstan. = Landing = Soyuz TMA-01M undocked from the Poisk module at 4:27 GMT on 16 March 2011. Slowing the spacecraft to begin the fall to Earth was initiated by a four-minute 17-second rocket firing starting at 7:03:17 GMT. Just before the atmospheric re-entry, the three modules making up the Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft separated as planned. Following a nominal re-entry, the central module carrying the crew touched down on its side at 7:54 GMT near Arkalyk in north central Kazakhstan. A few minutes later, Kaleri, Kelly and Skripochka were pulled from the capsule and placed in reclining chairs. The weather at the landing side was harsh with high winds and viciously frigid temperatures. At one point in his live landing commentary, NASA spokesman Rob Navias said \\"You would think that was a scene out of the North Pole,\\" to explain the extreme climatic conditions.

His activities were pioneering: in 1845 he was the first white man to take a farm from the American government in the wilds of Mason County, became the county's first coroner, probate judge and surveyor, and constructed its first framed building that functioned as a home, courthouse and jail. It is the only surviving landmark of Mason County's earliest history. Caswell was also the progenitor of a prominent Mason County family. Early life Caswell was born in 1807 as Aaron Burr Caswell at Glens Falls, New York. His parents were George and Sarah (Green) Caswell. He was named after Aaron Burr, one of the founding fathers of the United States. He went by the nickname \\"Burr\\" most of his life. Caswell learned cabinetry skills as his first trade and practiced this business for several years in Glens Falls. Caswell married Hannah Green in 1837 at Glens Falls, where they remained for a couple of years. Afterwards they went to Mississippi and were employed on the river boats. In 1842, Caswell and his family moved to Barrington Station, Lake County, Illinois, where they bought a farm and lived a few years. Mid life Ottawa family with bark and log house, c. 1885 Burr Caswell house in 1865 Caswell went on a hunting and fishing trip in 1845 to Pere Marquette Township in Mason County, Michigan. He hunted in the territory for the next two years, however spent most of his time fishing at Duck Lake. His nearest neighbor was some 30 miles to the north in the town of Manistee. He briefly returned to Illinois in 1847 to relocate permanently his family back to the area. The children he had at the time were Mary (15), George (13), Helen (10), and Edgar (7). When arriving by boat they realized the entrance channel to shore was too shallow for the ship The Eagle they were on so they came ashore in its small yawl sailboat. They threw overboard their animals they were hauling, which had to fend for themselves to get ashore. A distant relative, Frances Caswell Hanna, relates in her book Sand Sawdust and Sawlogs the story of their arrival. His family was the first permanent white settlers in the Pere Marquette Lake area, which was considered a frontier. Caswell had a good relationship with the local Michigan Ottawa Indians and learned their customs and religion. His family lived in dense wilderness and built a small two-story frame house in 1849 out of old driftwood. The house was built near the Indian village of Nin-de-be-ka-tun-ning, a village of bark and log rectangular lodges that had dome-shaped roofs. Caswell's house was the first frame structure in Mason County, which still stands at White Pine Village very near its original location when it got placed as the Mason County Historical Society's outdoor museum's centerpiece. He continually improved his farm while working in the lumber industry. In 1855, when Mason County officially became a county, Caswell allowed the first floor of his farmhouse to be used as a courthouse and trading post and the family moved upstairs. The Mason County Courthouse county seat was located at Caswell's house from 1856 to 1861. For many years, Caswell produced lumber from the local timber that was shipped to Chicago for construction. He operated the boat Ranger to deliver to Chicago shingles and lumber he made. The village which sprang up around the Caswells was called Pere Marquette, in honor of the missionary who died in the area in 1675. The territory around the village later became known as Pere Marquette township. Caswell was a delegate to the Republican party convention in 1868. He was elected county treasurer and served on the county board. Caswell was the first Mason County surveyor, coroner, probate judge and fish inspector. Later life Caswell and his eldest son were originally fishermen and trappers before working at Baird and Bean Lumber Mill in downtown Ludington. After Caswell's wife, Hannah Green, died in 1870, he moved to downtown Ludington and became the manager of a local shingle mill. In the 1870s, he worked as a foreman at Moulton & Flagg, a shingle mill in Ludington. In 1871, Caswell married again. His new wife's name was Sarah Billings. They moved into the Big Sable Point Lighthouse in 1873, where Caswell became its keeper. He became the fourth Big Sable Point Lighthouse lightkeeper serving duty there from January 9, 1874 to July 17, 1882. They lived at the lighthouse until 1878. Caswell and his second wife later moved to Mitchell, South Dakota, where they operated a large hotel, They were there until 1886. Caswell then returned to Ludington and ten years later he died in 1896. He is buried in Lakeview Cemetery in Ludington beside his first wife.

Hatfield himself became a notable fruit farmer. They had the first recorded marriage in Mason County. She was the mother of fourteen children, nine of whom died before her death in 1882. Helen, Mary's younger sister, was born about 1837 and married Sewell Moulton. Caswell's last child was Edgar, who was born in 1840 in Illinois and married Julia Genia in 1871. Edgar achieved fame as a prominent Ludington businessman.  Caswell's home  Aside from the second floor, Caswell's home was used as the site of the first Pere Marquette Township meeting by an act of the Michigan legislature: the front half of his home was the site of the first county seat and first courthouse in Mason County, the kitchen served as the county's first store and post office and the basement was used as a temporary jail. The Courthouse is recognized as a Registered State Historic Site, and the house was fully restored by the Mason County Historical Society between 1965 and 1976.

This machine is often misreported as a Morane-Saulnier H finishing with a time of 40 minutes 40 seconds.\\"The Monaco Meeting\\", 450 On 26 June, Claude Grahame- White flew another float-equipped example from Paris to London via Le Havre, Boulogne-sur-Mer, and Dover,\\"Mr Grahame-Wnite's Seine‚ÄîThames Trip\\" covering some that day.Hartmann 2001, 10 Between 21 and 28 September the same year, two float-equipped Type Gs competed at the seaplane meeting at San Sebasti√°n, with Lord Carbery winning the short takeoff prize on one, and Edmond Audemars winning the maneuverability prize on the other.Hartmann 2001, 11 The following week, Carbery flew his Type G in the Italian Waterplane Contest from Lake Como to Pavia and back, along with two other Type Gs in the field of fifteen competitors, these flown by Garros and Morane.Hartmann 2001, 12\\"Italian Waterplane Contest\\", 1129 Garros not only won the Grand Prize in the \\"general class\\", but also the prizes for best speed (127.7 km/h, 79.8 mph) and greatest altitude (2,100 m, 6,000 ft). On 28 September 1913 Roland Garros became the first person to cross the Mediterranean Sea by air, flying from Fr√©jus in the south of France to Bizerte in Tunisia in a Morane-Saulnier G. In 1914, Russian manufacturer Duks arranged to build the type under licence at their Moscow factory for the Russian Army, and the same year, the Turkish military ordered 40 examples. Before these could be delivered, however, war broke out, and the aircraft were impressed into the French Army. To these, the Army soon added an order of 94 aircraft, and the British Royal Flying Corps also acquired a number, these latter machines purchased from Grahame-White, who was manufacturing the type in the UK under licence. At the outbreak of war, the type's military value was found to be wanting, and the French machines were quickly relegated to training duties. Despite this, a dedicated single-seat fighter version was built in 1915, armed with an 8 mm Hotchkiss machine gun that fired through the propeller arc, the propeller blades being protected by deflector plates.\\"Morane-Saulnier type G\\" Only one or two prototypes were built, and the type never entered service.Green and Swanborough 1994 Some Type Gs were modified by Morane-Saulnier to have their wings mounted above the fuselage, parasol-fashion, rather than at the fuselage sides. This arrangement was found to offer far better visibility for the pilot, and formed the basis for the Morane-Saulnier L.

They have elongated bodies and large flaps. Triops granarius can be kept as pets in home aquaria. Their life expectancy is up to 90 days, and in that time they can grow more than 6 cm in length. Triops granarius range in colour from dark brown to a light brown with a greenish tinge. They can live in water with a pH from 6 to 10, but the optimal pH is from 7 to 8. Unlike most Triops species, males make up 40% of the population of this species. Males can be distinguished by their dark shade. Triops granarius lives in shallow pools or ponds and can survive for days without food,they can eat most organic matter such as detritus and plant debris. Triops granarius is exposed to desiccation and extreme temperatures after the water dries up in its habitat. To withstand this severe environment, Triops eggs enter anhydrobiosis after the water evaporates. The eggs can hatch 20 years later; this has enabled Triops to survive mass extinctions.

It occupies portions of eight of the municipalities and cities in the province such as Talakag, Baungon, Libona, Manolo Fortich, Impasugong, Lantapan and Malaybalay. The range is one of the few remaining rainforests in the Philippines, hosting one of the most important diverse species of rare and endemic wildlife such as the Philippine eagle. Five of its peaks have very high elevations: Mount Dulang-dulang, the highest at 2,941 meters; Mount Kitanglad at 2,899 meters; Mount Maagnaw at 2,742 meters; Mount Lumuluyaw at 2,612 meters; and Mount Tuminungan at 2,400 meters. The name \\"kitanglad\\" was derived from a legend that there was once a great flood that submerged the native lands of Bukidnon and only the tip of the mountain, the size of a \\"tanglad\\" (lemon grass), remained visible (\\"kita\\" in Cebuano).

In 1994, it was chosen as one of the 10 priority sites under the World Bank through the Conservation of Priority Protected Areas Project. Mount Kitanglad and its outlying area was proclaimed a protected area under the natural park category through Presidential Proclamation 896 dated October 24, 1996. On November 9, 2000, the park finally became a full-pledge protected area when Congress approved R.A. 8978 also known as the Mt. Kitanglad Range Protected Area Act of 2000. Geographical location Kitanglad Mountain Range is located in the northern central part of Bukidnon province, directly north of the neighboring Kalatungan Mountain Range. It lies in between 8¬∞7‚Ä≤42‚Ä≥N and 124¬∞55‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥E. It is bounded in the west by Talakag, northwest by Baungon, on the north by Libona and Manolo Fortich, on the northeast by Impasugong, on the east by Malaybalay City and on the south by Lantapan. Climate The climate at the Kitanglad Ranges falls under the Modified Corona Classification, which is characterized by a short dry season usually lasting from one to three months, and no pronounced rainy season. The area is cloud-covered all year round. Temperature ranges from 22.7 ¬∞C in January to 24.6 ¬∞C in June. It receives the highest amount of rainfall in June. The driest period is March. Hydrological features The Kitanglad Mountain Range forms the headwater catchment area of several major river systems draining north and central Mindanao. Among these rivers are the Cagayan River, Tagoloan River, and Pulangi River, a major tributary of the Rio Grande de Mindanao. Drainage in the area is in a characteristic radial pattern, emanating from the highest points in the range..

Number 02 001 was the first Einheitsdampflokomotive in the DRG to be completed. In procuring a standard express train steam locomotive, the Deutsche Reichsbahn carried out a comparison between a superheated two- cylinder type (the DRG Class 01) and a four-cylinder compound locomotive (the Class 02). Ten examples of each type were built from 1925, and the Class 02 vehicles were given operating numbers 02 001 ‚Äì 02 010\\\\. The first eight engines were manufactured in 1925 by the firm of Henschel, two more were built in 1926 by Maffei. Because the Class 02 steam engines were badly designed, the compound engine could only produce a high level of power at speeds of over 70 km/h. In addition, below 1000 PSi its steam consumption was higher than that of the Class 01. Compared with the Class 01s, these engines had a complicated, and therefore maintenance-intensive, drive; as a result no more were ordered. From 1937 to 1942 the vehicles were successively converted to two-cylinder operation and regrouped as Class 01s with the new numbers 01 011 and 01 233 ‚Äì 01 241\\\\. The first eight engines were equipped with 2'2' T 30 tenders; the other two with 2'2 T 32 tenders. Later on, the second tender was coupled to all of the first eight engines as well.

It is named for Thomas Horsfield, an American naturalist who presented the type specimen to the British Museum. Description Horsfield's fruit bat is a medium-sized megabat, intermediate in size between flying foxes and pygmy fruit bats. Adults weigh around , and have light-grey to brown fur, with a reddish-brown or orange mantle around the shoulders. In some males, the mantle extends across the chest, and the fur is often brighter in colour than in females. The rim of the ears and the skin overlying the metacarpals and phalanges within the wing are white. Juveniles have a more bland coat pattern, with uniformly dull buff or grey fur. The bats have a short, broad snout, ending in a pair of almost tubular nostrils. Both the eyes and ears are large, although the latter have a simpler structure than in most other bats, and lack tragi. The wings have a low aspect ratio and high wing loading, typical of many megabats, and indicating a relatively slow flight speed and moderate manoeuvrability. Distribution and habitat Horsfield's fruit bat is found in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. Within this region, it inhabits a broad range of lowland habitats, from dense primary rain forest to agricultural land and suburban gardens. The four recognised subspecies are: *C. h. harpax - Thailand, peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra *C. h. horsfieldii - Java and islands east to Sumbawa **C. h. persimilis - Borneo *C. h. princeps - Nias Biology and behaviour Horsfield's fruit bats eat the fruit of strangler figs, Elaeocarpus, and Payena, and the flowers of bitter beans. They have been reported to pluck fruit from trees and carry it to roosts elsewhere to feed. During the dry season, when fruit is in short supply, they instead feed on pollen, which they take from a wide variety of plants. They live in small groups, consisting of a single adult male and up to five females and their young. Although these groups are maintained year-round, individual females often move between different groups, and may spend some time nesting alone between leaving one group and joining another. They roost in trees and cave mouths, reportedly favouring banana trees. They often modify their roosting sites by constructing tents from the leaves, partly cutting through them to make an inverted \\"V\\" shape. They breed throughout the year, but most commonly give birth at two times of the year, between February and March and between July and August. They have been reported to live for at least 31 months.

He stopped at Lainshaw Castle to dine with his close relative, a Montgomerie who was Lord of Lainshaw and whose Lady was a Margaret Cunninghame of Aiket Castle, with sisters were married to John Cunninghame of Corsehill and David Cunninghame of Robertland. It seems that a plot to kill the Earl as an act of revenge had been organised by Lady Montgomerie. After the murder Lady Margaret Montgomerie was said to have fled to Ireland, however it seems that she actually remained close by, living with an estate tenant, one Robert Barr and family at Pearce Bank farm, now High Peacockbank. She was eventually permitted to return to her husband and home, however she never again left the grounds of Lainshaw Castle and she avoided any contact with the Montgomerie family for the remainder of her days.
