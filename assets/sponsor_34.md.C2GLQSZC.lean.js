It may be manually operated, electrically or pneumatically driven and may use chain, fiber or wire rope as its lifting medium. The most familiar form is an elevator, the car of which is raised and lowered by a hoist mechanism. Most hoists couple to their loads using a lifting hook. Today, there are a few governing bodies for the North American overhead hoist industry which include the Hoist Manufactures Institute (HMI), ASME, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). HMI is a product counsel of the Material Handling Industry of America consisting of hoist manufacturers promoting safe use of their products.  Types  Builder's hoist, with small gasoline engine Trump International Hotel & Tower-Chicago A water-powered mine hoist used for raising ore from De re metallica The word ‚Äúhoist‚Äù is used to describe many different types of equipment that lift and lower loads. For example, many people use ‚Äúhoist‚Äù to describe an elevator. The information contained here pertains specially to overhead, construction and mine hoist.  Overhead  Overhead hoists are defined in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) B30 standards as a machinery unit that is used for lifting or lowering a freely suspended (unguided) load. These units are typically used in an industrial setting and may be part of an overhead crane. A specific overhead hoist configuration is usually defined by the lifting medium, operation and suspension. The lifting medium is the type of component used to transmit and cause the vertical motion and includes wire rope, chain or synthetic strap, or rope. The operation defines the type of power used to operate the hoisting motion and includes manual power, electric power, hydraulic power or air power. The suspension defines the type of mounting method used to suspend the hoist and includes hook, clevis, lug, trolley, deck, base, wall or ceiling. The most commonly used overhead hoist is electrical powered with wire rope or chain as the lifting medium. Both wire rope and chain hoist have been in common use since the 1800s, however mass production of electric hoists did not start until the early 1900s and was first adapted by Germany. A hoist can be a serial production unit or a custom unit. Serial production hoists are typically more cost-effective and designed for a ten-year life in a light to heavy hoist duty service classification. Custom hoists are typically more expensive and are designed for a heavy to severe hoist duty service classification. Serial production hoists were once regarded as being designed for light to moderate hoist duty service classifications, but since the 60's this has changed.Reference Pending Over the years the custom hoist market has decreased in size with the advent of the more durable serial production hoists. A machine shop or fabricating shop will typically use a serial production hoist, while a steel mill or NASA may typically use a custom hoist to meet durability and performance requirements. When selecting an overhead hoist, several application parameters must be considered. These are the average operating time per day, load spectrum, starts per hour, operating period and equipment life. These parameters determine the Hoist Duty Service Classification, and are further defined in the document ‚ÄúComparison of Hoist Duty Service Classifications‚Äù to help hoist installers and users better understand the hoist's useful life and duty service application. Proper installation, operation, inspection, maintenance and safe use of overhead hoists is paramount. Refer to the ‚ÄúHMI 100.23 Operator‚Äôs Manual - Hoist‚Äù, ‚ÄúHMI 100.75 Operator‚Äôs Manual ‚Äì Lever Hoist‚Äù, ‚ÄúHMI 100.24 Inspection and Maintenance Manual - Hoist‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHMI 100.74 Inspection and Maintenance Manual ‚Äì Lever Hoist‚Äù. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers also publishes a number or standards related to overhead hoists. The ‚ÄúASME B30.16 Standard for Overhead Hoists (Underhung)‚Äù and ‚ÄúASME B30.21 Standard for Lever Hoists‚Äù provide additional guidance for the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of hoists. Construction Also known as a Man-Lift, Buckhoist, temporary elevator, builder hoist, passenger hoist or construction elevator, this type of hoist is commonly used on large scale construction projects, such as high-rise buildings or major hospitals. There are many other uses for the construction elevator. Many other industries use the buckhoist for full-time operations, the purpose being to carry personnel, materials, and equipment quickly between the ground and higher floors, or between floors in the middle of a structure. There are three types: Utility to move material, personnel to move personnel, and dual-rated, which can do both. The construction hoist is made up of either one or two cars (cages) which travel vertically along stacked mast tower sections. The mast sections are attached to the structure or building every for added stability. For precisely controlled travel along the mast sections, modern construction hoists use a motorized rack-and-pinion system that climbs the mast sections at various speeds. While hoists have been predominantly produced in Europe and the United States, China is emerging as a manufacturer of hoists to be used in Asia. In the United States and abroad, General Contractors and various other industrial markets rent or lease hoists for a specific projects. Rental or leasing companies provide erection, dismantling, and repair services to their hoists to provide General Contractors with turnkey services. Also, the rental and leasing companies can provide parts and service for the elevators that are under contract. Mine A mining hoist (also known simply as a hoist or winder) is used in underground mining to raise and lower conveyances within the mine shaft. It is similar to an elevator, used for raising humans, equipment, and assorted loads. Human, animal and water power were used to power the mine hoists documented in Agricola's De Re Metallica, published in 1556. Stationary steam engines were commonly used to power mine hoists through the 19th century and into the 20th, as at the Quincy Mine, where a 4-cylinder cross-compound corliss engine was used.Quincy No. 2 Mine Hoist (1920) National Historic Engineering Landmark brochure, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 1984. Modern hoists are powered using electric motors, historically with direct current drives utilizing solid-state converters (thyristors); however, modern large hoists use alternating current drives that are variable-frequency controlled. There are three principal types of hoists used in mining applications, Drum Hoists, Friction (or Kope) hoists and Blair multi-rope hoists. Hoist can be defined as anything that is used to lift any heavy materials.

Love carvings Initials of several couples carved into a tree. Most bear dates from the 1920s and 1930s. Lovers' initials carved into trees. Carving names and initials into trees is a common practise among lovers; the carvings can last for decades, as a symbol of the permanence of the couple's love. This practise would appear to date back up to the Classical era, with Callimachus writing in his Aetia, \\"But graven on your bark may ye bear such writing as shall declare \\"Cydippe beautiful\\".\\" (fragment 73) It also appears in the Eclogues of Virgil: \\"Resolved am I in the woods, rather, with wild beasts to couch, and bear my doom, and character my love upon the tender tree-trunks: they will grow, and you, my love, grow with them.\\" This carving was also practised in Renaissance England, as evidenced by the writings of William Shakespeare (in As You Like It, 1599) and John Evelyn (in Sylva, 1664). Aspen carvings Portrait in aspen tree of Tom Mix, dated 1936, Santa Fe National Forest, R√≠o Arriba County, New Mexico Aspen carvings are arborglyphs made in the bark of aspen trees by shepherds, many of them Basque and Irish American, throughout the Western United States. They have been documented across northern California and in areas such as Boise, Idaho and Steamboat Springs, Colorado.Kelly Bastone, \\"Aspen Diaries\\" , \\"Steamboat Magazine\\", Summer 2005 A grove of aspens with Basque arborglyphs in the Steens Mountain region of southeastern Oregon have been designated as Oregon Heritage Trees. A project run by the USDA Forest Service in 1997 to record and study arborglyphs in the Fremont National Forest of Oregon is documented here. Researchers in Boise, Idaho have also reportedly documented arborglyphs in their area. In the West the preferred carving tree is the aspen, which has a lifespan of only about 85 years on average. Arborglyph and Native America: Ancient Astronomers The glyph on the \\"scorpion tree\\" viewed from Painted Rock in Carrizo Plain, California shows the counterclockwise rotation of stars around Polaris and appears to portray Ursa Major in relation to Polaris Paleontologist Rex Saint Onge recognized that the tree was carved by Native Americans when he stumbled upon it in the fall of 2006. Located in a shady grove atop the Santa Lucia Mountains in San Luis Obispo County, the centuries-old gnarled oak had the image of a six-legged, lizard-like being meticulously scrawled into its trunk, the nearly three-foot-tall beast topped with a rectangular crown and two large spheres. \\"I was really the first one to come across it who understood that it was a Chumash motif,\\" says Saint Onge, (displaying an ignorance of local Chumash knowledge which informed multiple people of this arborglyph, including Onge) and acting as an 'expert' by referring to the Native American Chumash Tribe who painted similar designs on rock formations from San Luis Obispo south through Santa Barbara and into Malibu. He quickly learned that the constellation's placement during sunset could be used to tell the seasons and that the Chumash people also revered this astronomical relationship in their language and cosmology. \\"It's the third largest constellation in the sky and they saw it every single night for tens of thousands of years,\\" says Saint Onge. \\"It was like the TV being stuck on the same channel playing the same show nonstop.\\" It became increasingly obvious to Saint Onge that the arborglyph and related cave paintings weren't just the work of wild-eyed, drug-induced shamans ‚Äî which has been a leading theory for decades ‚Äî but that the ancient images were deliberate studies of the stars and served as integral components of the Chumash people's annual calendar. \\"This gives us an insight into what the indigenous people of Central California were doing,\\" says Saint Onge, who published his theory last fall in the Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology. \\"It wasn't just the daily simpleton tasks of hunter- gatherers. They were actually monitoring the stars.\\" Further in \\"Time\\", Matt Kettman on Feb.09/2010 writes \\"Tree Carving in California: Ancient Astronomers\\" Saint Onge isn't the first to speculate that Chumash paintings might have astronomical implications. The anthropologist Travis Hudson did so back in the 1970s with his book Crystals in the Sky, which combined his observations of rock art with the cultural data recorded nearly a century earlier by legendary ethnographer John P. Harrington. Chatham Islands An example of Chatham Islands carvings In the Chatham Islands (Rƒìkohu) of New Zealand, the indigenous Moriori people practised the art of momori rakau, or tree carving. The carvings depict Moriori karapuna (ancestors) and symbols of the natural world, such as patiki (flounder) and the hopo (albatross). During the late 1998 review 82 trees were found with carvings. Numbers of momori rakau have been steadily declining due to the age of the host trees, stock grazing, wind and in earlier years, people removing the carvings as souvenirs. The best known examples of momori rakau are at JM Barker (Hapupu) National Historic Reserve, where the carvings and trees are protected by a fenced enclosure and the protection of being one of only two National Historic Reserves in New Zealand. The reserve was fenced in 1980 to provide protection for the tree carvings from grazing stock and is now showing good recovery. Planning is underway between the Department of Conservation (DOC) and the Moriori people to secure a small portion of the reserve for contemporary Moriori carvers to begin a new generation of momori-rakau. The dendroglyph ritual may be associated with death or remembrance. Many scholars over the years have tried to penetrate the reasons behind these incisions into the trunks of the kopi (karaka) trees and have not come up with explanations that satisfy everybody. The dendroglyphs cover a range of features, with many representing human figures and others clearly representative of birds, fish, plants and animals. The momori rakau are among the few visible remaining signs of Moriori culture from pre-European contact. Damage to trees American beech in Waterloo State Recreation Area, Michigan. Carving in the bark may damage the tree, by allowing insects or fungi to enter the tree interior, or by damaging the phloem (sugar transport tubes) under the bark. References * J.

The ancient panns over centuries evolved first into a pentatonic scale and later into the seven note Carnatic Sargam. But from the earliest times, Tamil Music is heptatonic and known as Ezhisai (‡Æè‡Æ¥‡Æø‡Æö‡Øà).Adiyarkunallar's commentary to the Aychiyarkkuravai, the seventh book of Cilappatikaram gives the number of Srutis and how they were allotted among Seven notes. Panns in literature There are several references to music and Panns in the ancient pre-Sangam and Sangam literature starting from the earliest known work Tholkappiyam (500 BCE). Among Sangam literature, Mathuraikkanci refers to women singing sevvazhi pann to invoke the mercy of God during childbirth. In Tolkappiyam, the five landscapes of the Sangam literature had each an associated Pann, each describing the mood of the song associated with that landscape. Among the numerous panns that find mention in the ancient Tamil literature are, Ambal Pann, which is suitable to be played on the flute, sevvazhi pann on the Yazh (lute), Nottiram and Sevvazhi expressing pathos, the captivating Kurinji pann and the invigorating Murudappann. The Sangam landscape was classified into five regions to describe the mood of the poem and to describe the intangibles of human emotions. While describing life and romance, the poets employed the background of the natural landscape and used the pann specific to that landscape to provide the mood. The neithal (seaside) landscape, which is employed to convey the grief of separation of lovers had the associated sevvazhi pann expressing pathos. Malaipatukatam mentions Viraliyar singing Kurinjipann when offering worship to the deities of the mountainous regions. It also refers to Virali singing Marudappann before singing the eulogies of kings. Malaippadukadam also refers to the people trying to overcome their fatigue by singing Marudappann after working in the fields. There is a very interesting reference to Panns and birds/insects in Perumpanarruppatai. It says that the beetles liked to listen to Kurinjipann played on Vilyazh thinking it to be the voice of its own kith and kin, while they hated to listen to Palaipann played on flute. There are also references to the Panar taking delight in mastering the Naivalam pann. Evolution of Panns The post-Sangam period, between the third and the fifth centuries CE, Tamil music evolved to a higher sophistication. Silappatikaram, written around the fifth century CE, describes music based on logical, systematic and scientific calculations in the arrangements of the dancers on the stage to represent the notes and panns. silappatikaram contains several chapters dedicated to music and dance, of which the most famous is the kanal vari which is a duet between the hero Kovalan and his lady-love Madavi. Cilappatikaram contains musical terminology such as, azhaku and matthirai referring to the musical pitch and the smallest fraction of an audible sound distinguishable by the human ear. From these evolved the scales. Development of scales One of the first scales employed by the ancient Tamils was the Mullaippann, a pentatonic scale composed of the notes sa ri ga pa da equivalent to C, D, E, G and A in the western notations. These fully harmonic scales, constitutes the raga Mohanam in the Carnatic music style. Mullaippann further evolved into Sempaalai, a scale based on seven notes by the addition of two more notes, ma and ni to the pentatonic scale. Sempaalai pann corresponds to the Carnatic raga Harikambhoji. In ancient Tamil, the seven notes were termed as kural, tuttam, kaikkilai, uzhai, ili, vilari and taaram. The seven basic notes are then developed into twelve swaras corresponding to the twelve houses of the zodiac. The ancient Tamils also derived new panns by the process of modal shift of tonic and by the process of reallocating the pitch and beat of the notes. Cilappatikaram has an example of this in the chapter Arangetrukadai, where the Pann Mercharupalai is changed to derive a new Pann. By the model shift of the tonic (‡Æ™‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æ£‡ØÅ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡ÆØ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ≤‡Øç) the ancient Tamils devised the seven major palais. Using the process of the cycle of fifth (called aaya palai) or the cycle of fourth, five semitones were developed. For example, if the cycle is started with kural (sa), the fifth note will yield iLi (pa), the sa-pa relationship. In the cycle of fourth, kural (sa) will give uzhai (ma), the sa-ma relationship. These five semitones were added to the original seven notes giving 12 notes of the ancient Tamil musical octave. Among the 12 notes, the flats were called kuRai (‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡Øà) and the sharps were called nirai (‡Æ®‡Æø‡Æ±‡Øà). The seven major palais or parent scales of the music of the ancient Tamils are: Sempalai (corresponding to the present Harikambhoji), Padumalai Palai (Natabhairavi), Sevvazhi Palai (Hanumatodi), Arum Palai (Dheerasankarabharanam), Kodi Palai (Kharaharapriya), Vilari Palai (Hanumatodi), and Merchem Palai (Mechakalyani). The four original panns of maruthappann, kurinchippann, sevvazhi and sadari thus evolved into 103 panns with varying characterisations. In all of these PaNs, Uyir SurangaL (Jeevaswarams: Life Notes) exist. The life note of a PaN is embellished according to the notes that appear immediately before and after. This is called Alangaaram (Gamakkam). Taking into consideration all these special notes, PaN Isai is different from Karnatik Music. Karnatik Music as two variations of each of the variables; Ri, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni. PaN Isai has 4 variations of each of the 5 variable. Plus the 2 constants; Sa and Pa, there are 22 variations of the 7 basic notes. We all should know what twenty-two over seven is. The ancient name for Raagam is Niram. Mehlakkatha was called Thaai Niram and Raagams born from there were call Say Niram. The ancient name for ThaaLam is PaaNi. For example, Roobaga ThaaLam was PaaNi MoonDRoththu. Before Sa, Ri, Ga... Tamils used the 12 Tamil Vowels. Looking at a keyboard, they would've used the 5 KuRil (Short Sounds) for the black keys and the 7 NeDil (Long Sounds) for the white keys. Some of the panns and their equivalent Carnatic ragas were: * Panchamam ‚Äì Ahiri * Pazham Panchuram - Sankarabharanam * Meharahkkurinchi - Neelambari * Pazhanthakka Ragam - Arabhi * Kurinchi - Malahari * Natta Ragam ‚Äì Panthuvaraali * Inthalam - Nathanamakriya * Thakkesi - Kambhoji * Kausikam - Bhairavi * Nattappadai ‚Äì Gambhiranaattai * GandharaPanchamam ‚Äì Kedara Gowlai Panns in Saivite hymns After the Sangam period and during the occupation of the Tamil country by Kalabhras, Tamil music was dormant for a period of a few centuries. With the advent of the Saivite saints Manikkavacakar (100 AD), Sundarar (900 AD), Thirunavukkarasar and Thirugnana Sambanthar (7th century CE) who used the ancient panns in their hymns (Tevaram), Tamil music experienced a revival. Only through these Tirumurais, hymns by Seerkaazhi Muthuthaandavar, hymn by Marimutha Pillai, Arunagirinathar, Ramalinga Swamigal and the hymns of Vaishnavite Alvars we can still experience the ancient traditions of the Tamil panns. Sambanthar used the following seven panns: nattapaadai, Thakka ragam, Pazhanthakka ragam, Thakkesi, Kurinji, Viyazhak kurinji, and Meharahakkurinji. Manikkavacagar used Mulai Pann (Mohana Raagam) for the majority of his Thiruvasagam and Thirukkovaiyar. There are a few of his hymns where he used Bowli, Megaragakkurinji and Kalyaani. Sundaramoorthi SwamigaL wise widely influenced by Thirunyaanasambandhar SwamigaL and Thirunaavukkarasar 'Appar' SwamigaL, who used PaN Koli quite often. In actual, only Thirunaavukkarasar SwamigaL sang the Dhehvaaram, which made-up the 4th, 5th and 6th ThirumuRaigaL. Thirunyaanasambandhar SwamigaL wrote the ThirukaDaikaapu, which makes up the 1st, 2nd and 3rd ThirumuRaigaL. Thiru Sundharamoorthi SwamigaL wrote the ThirupaaTTu, which makes up the 7th ThirumuRai. Thiru MaaNikkavaasagar's Thiruvaasagam and Thirukkohvaiyaar makes up the 8th ThirumuRai. There 12 ThirumuRais. Thirumoolar's Thirumandhiram is the 10th ThirumuRai and SekkiZHaar's Thiru ThoNDar PuraaNam, or Periya PuraaNam is the 12th ThirumuRai.

One common observational study is about the possible effect of a treatment on subjects, where the assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group is outside the control of the investigator. This is in contrast with experiments, such as randomized controlled trials, where each subject is randomly assigned to a treated group or a control group.  Motivation  The independent variable may be beyond the control of the investigator for a variety of reasons: * A randomized experiment would violate ethical standards. Suppose one wanted to investigate the abortion ‚Äì breast cancer hypothesis, which postulates a causal link between induced abortion and the incidence of breast cancer. In a hypothetical controlled experiment, one would start with a large subject pool of pregnant women and divide them randomly into a treatment group (receiving induced abortions) and a control group (not receiving abortions), and then conduct regular cancer screenings for women from both groups. Needless to say, such an experiment would run counter to common ethical principles. (It would also suffer from various confounds and sources of bias, e.g. it would be impossible to conduct it as a blind experiment.) The published studies investigating the abortion‚Äìbreast cancer hypothesis generally start with a group of women who already have received abortions. Membership in this \\"treated\\" group is not controlled by the investigator: the group is formed after the \\"treatment\\" has been assigned. * The investigator may simply lack the requisite influence. Suppose a scientist wants to study the public health effects of a community- wide ban on smoking in public indoor areas. In a controlled experiment, the investigator would randomly pick a set of communities to be in the treatment group. However, it is typically up to each community and/or its legislature to enact a smoking ban. The investigator can be expected to lack the political power to cause precisely those communities in the randomly selected treatment group to pass a smoking ban. In an observational study, the investigator would typically start with a treatment group consisting of those communities where a smoking ban is already in effect. * A randomized experiment may be impractical. Suppose a researcher wants to study the suspected link between a certain medication and a very rare group of symptoms arising as a side effect. Setting aside any ethical considerations, a randomized experiment would be impractical because of the rarity of the effect. There may not be a subject pool large enough for the symptoms to be observed in at least one treated subject. An observational study would typically start with a group of symptomatic subjects and work backwards to find those who were given the medication and later developed the symptoms. Thus a subset of the treated group was determined based on the presence of symptoms, instead of by random assignment. *Many randomized controlled trials are not broadly representative of real-world patients and this may limit their external validity. Patients who are eligible for inclusion in a randomized controlled trial are usually younger, more likely to be male, healthier and more likely to be treated according to recommendations from guidelines. If and when the intervention is later added to routine-care, a large portion of the patients who will receive it may be old with many concomitant diseases and drug-therapies, although these particular patient groups will not have been studied in the initial experimental trials. An observational study that examines the real-world patients in everyday routine care can complement the results from the randomized trial in order to be more generally applicable in the patient population.  Types  *Case-control study: study originally developed in epidemiology, in which two existing groups differing in outcome are identified and compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute. *Cross-sectional study: involves data collection from a population, or a representative subset, at one specific point in time. *Longitudinal study: correlational research study that involves repeated observations of the same variables over long periods of time. Cohort study and Panel study are particular forms of longitudinal study.  Degree of usefulness and reliability  Although observational studies cannot be used to make definitive statements of fact about the \\"safety, efficacy, or effectiveness\\" of a practice, they are reported to: :\\"1) provide information on ‚Äúreal world‚Äù use and practice; :2) detect signals about the benefits and risks of...[the] use [of practices] in the general population; :3) help formulate hypotheses to be tested in subsequent experiments; :4) provide part of the community-level data needed to design more informative pragmatic clinical trials; and :5) inform clinical practice.\\"\\"Although observational studies cannot provide definitive evidence of safety, efficacy, or effectiveness, they can: 1) provide information on \\"real world\\" use and practice; 2) detect signals about the benefits and risks of complementary therapies use in the general population; 3) help formulate hypotheses to be tested in subsequent experiments; 4) provide part of the community-level data needed to design more informative pragmatic clinical trials; and 5) inform clinical practice.\\" \\"Observational Studies and Secondary Data Analyses To Assess Outcomes in Complementary and Integrative Health Care.\\" Richard Nahin, Ph.D., M.P.H., Senior Advisor for Scientific Coordination and Outreach, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, June 25, 2012  Bias and compensating methods  In all of those cases, if a randomized experiment cannot be carried out, the alternative line of investigation suffers from the problem that the decision of which subjects receive the treatment is not entirely random and thus is a potential source of bias. A major challenge in conducting observational studies is to draw inferences that are acceptably free from influences by overt biases, as well as to assess the influence of potential hidden biases. An observer of an uncontrolled experiment (or process) records potential factors and the data output: the goal is to determine the effects of the factors. Sometimes the recorded factors may not be directly causing the differences in the output. There may be more important factors which were not recorded but are, in fact, causal. Also, recorded or unrecorded factors may be correlated which may yield incorrect conclusions. Finally, as the number of recorded factors increases, the likelihood increases that at least one of the recorded factors will be highly correlated with the data output simply by chance. In lieu of experimental control, multivariate statistical techniques allow the approximation of experimental control with statistical control, which accounts for the influences of observed factors that might influence a cause-and-effect relationship. In healthcare and the social sciences, investigators may use matching to compare units that nonrandomly received the treatment and control. One common approach is to use propensity score matching in order to reduce confounding,Rosenbaum, Paul R. 2009. Design of Observational Studies. New York: Springer. although this has recently come under criticism for exacerbating the very problems it seeks to solve.  link to the full article (from the author's homepage A report from the Cochrane Collaboration in 2014 came to the conclusion that observational studies are very similar in results reported by similarly conducted randomized controlled trials. In other words, it reported little evidence for significant effect estimate differences between observational studies and randomized controlled trials, regardless of specific observational study design, heterogeneity, or inclusion of studies of pharmacological interventions. It, therefore, recommended that factors other than study design per se need to be considered when exploring reasons for a lack of agreement between results of randomized controlled trials and observational studies. In 2007, several prominent medical researchers issued the Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) statement, in which they called for observational studies to conform to 22 criteria that would make their conclusions easier to understand and generalise.

Structural design by Vladimir Shukhov; floorplan layout by Konstantin Melnikov. 1929, Moscow Melnikov's concept of free-flow garage layout Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage was a public bus garage in Moscow, designed in 1926 by Konstantin Melnikov (floorplan concept and architectural design) and Vladimir Shukhov (structural engineering). The building, completed in 1927, was an example of applying avant-garde architectural methods to an industrial facility. Neglected for decades and nearly condemned to demolition, it was restored in 2007‚Äì2008 and reopened in September 2008 as a gallery of modern art. Original design In 1925, Melnikov travelled to Paris, supervising construction of his Soviet Pavilion at the Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes. There, he received private commissions for garage buildings integrated with bridges over Seine river. These drafts never got beyond concept stage, however, Melnikov found an economical layout that enabled parking large number of cars without ever using reverse gear. Back in Moscow, Melnikov saw a new fleet of Leyland buses tucked into a narrow yard in Bolshaya Ordynka Street. He approached city transportation board and quickly sold his idea for a free- flow garage. It was built on a large lot in Bakhmetevskaya Street, 11 (then a working class suburb north from Garden Ring; later, the street was renamed Obraztsova Street). Roof structure was designed by Vladimir Shukhov; next year, Melnikov and Shukhov worked together on another building, a horseshoe- shaped Novo-Ryazanskaya Street Truck Garage. Bakhmetevsky garage housed 104 buses on an area of 8500 square meters. Bakhmetevsky Garage, sometimes associated with constructivist architecture, was in fact styled in an indefinite red-brick industrial livery; circular windows in the attic are the only avant-garde features (and even these were destroyed decades ago). What makes it stand out as an avant-garde landmark is its unorthodox, parallelogram-shaped floorplan and the subsequent influence on later industrial designs. Later development The whole project was more than just a garage. Melnikov also designed workshops and office buildings on the same lot, filling the irregular voids made by placing a parallelogram-shaped garage on a larger, rectangular lot. His original, unpublished 1927 master plan was found in 1999, in preparation to Melnikov memorial exhibition, and served as a base for 2003 redevelopment plan. However, in 1928 Melnikov changed this plan, and, after completing the office building himself, passed construction management to Andrey Kurochkin. Preservation attempts In 1990, the aging garage was listed as an architectural memorial. In 2001, the bus company vacated the building and the City Hall donated it to the Moscow Hasidic Jewish Community Center for redevelopment, on condition that the Community Center build a public school on the same lot and return it to the City. The Community Center approached architect Alexey Vorontsov to design the whole project. Before the drafts were completed in 2001, the builders removed the roofing and began disassembling the roof trusses, destroying eight spans. Public intervention suspended further destruction; Vorontsov persuaded the client to hire a professional restoration bureau to assess the extent and cost of preservation. Eventually, in 2003, the Community Center and the authorities agreed upon a compromise development plan by Vorontsov that would retain the original exterior walls. A public school, however, was to be completed next to Melnikov's garage, leaving the Jewish community with an opportunity to build another cultural institution that incorporated the facade of Melnikov's 1928 building. After years of neglect, work accelerated in the second half of 2007. The garage was fully restored externally in the first half of 2008 complete with 1920-s style lettering on the eastern (entrance) facade; interior work was completed by Jamie Fobert Architects in September 2008. The building was reopened to the public in September as the Garage Center for Contemporary Culture (abbreviated in Russian as CCC), featuring an exhibition of Ilya and Emilia Kabakov. A new gallery provides 8,500 square meters of exhibition space. The Center is managed by Daria Zhukova; the speed and expense of the 2007‚Äì2008 restoration project is attributed to the sponsorship of Roman Abramovich, who chairs the board of trustees for the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia. On the day of inauguration of the art gallery Alexander Boroda, president of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia, announced plans to convert the garage into a \\"Jewish Museum of Tolerance\\" to open in 2011.

MillerThe Benjamin K. Miller Collection is a unique collection of stamps and other philatelic materials donated to The New York Public Library in 1925 by Milwaukee attorney Benjamin Kurtz Miller (1857-1928). This collection was the first complete collection of U.S. stamps ever assembled. His collection is known as the \\"crown jewels\\" of U.S. stamp collecting for its rare holdings, depth, and variety. One cent Z Grill Of the great rarities and philatelic items in the collection is the One-Cent Z Grill, one of the rarest of all U.S. stamps. Only two copies of this stamp are known to exist, the other copy is in the collection of Bill Gross. Background Benjamin Kurtz Miller was born in 1857, the son of a Milwaukee lawyer and grandson of one of the first federal judges in Wisconsin. He joined his father‚Äôs firm in 1877 and later became a partner, retiring in 1906 to pursue personal interests. The firm continues today through its successor, the major U.S. law firm Foley & Lardner. The collection Miller built his collection a little late in life at the age of 61. He started stamp collecting seriously on a large scale only after 1918, when he bought one of the famous Inverted Jenny stamps at the age of 61. Later he intensified his collecting, by writing articles in stamp journals and purchasing from up to 30 dealers. By the early 1920s, Miller was on the way to his ultimate achievement: collecting one example of every U.S. postage stamp in the Scott catalogue of his day. He also collected varieties like color shades, frauds and forgeries, fresh unused stamps, and varied cancellations. Miller also enjoyed plating stamps, seeking one copy for each position on a printing plate. The display The collection was displayed at the library for more than 50 years. However it was locked away after a theft of 153 of its rarest stamps in 1977. Even though 81 of the stamps were later recovered (some of them mutilated to disguise their provenance) the library did not put the collection back on display., pp. 169ff. It returned to public view when the National Postal Museum put it on display in two parts in from 27 May 2006 to 1 October 2007, and in 2007 from 5 November to 12 January 2009. Recognition In recognition of Miller's philatelic accomplishments and scholarship, the Royal Philatelic Society upgraded his status from \\"member\\" to \\"fellow\\".

It is the opening track from their third studio album, Enema of the State (1999). A live version of the song was released as a promotional single in November 2000 supporting the band's live album The Mark, Tom and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back). The song explores frustration in relationships. Background Though credited to both guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus, the song was written and sung by DeLonge. The song originated as a collection of unrelated guitar riffs, which he considered \\"catchy and intricate but simple\\", bridged with what he felt was a \\"very nursery rhyme\\" riff to augment the verse. The song opens Enema of the State; DeLonge, in the 2016 documentary The Pursuit of Tone, felt it was a good indication of the direction the band was heading in, and called it \\"probably the best opener we've ever had.\\" \\"Dumpweed\\" explores frustration with women. Gavin Edwards of Rolling Stone summarized the song as \\"about an ambivalent guy imagining the pain and the freedom of breaking up with his girlfriend, set to an unstoppable staccato rhythm.\\" It has been described \\"callow complaint about girls not always doing exactly what you wish they would\\" by New York Nitsuh Abebe. The song is based around the hook \\"I need a girl that I can train,\\" as in dog training. DeLonge explains the song in a 2000 tour booklet: \\"Girls are so much smarter than guys and can see the future as well as never forget the past. So that leaves the dog as the only thing men are smarter than.\\" In an interview with MTV News the previous year, he clarified that the line did not refer to his girlfriend: \\"I got a lot of shit from her for that one.\\" The promo single prepends a masturbation joke from The Mark, Tom and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back) to the beginning of the track. Reception Michael Paoletta, in a review of the promotional live single in 2000 for Billboard, wrote that \\"stylistically, [the song] represents frantic, manic ska at its adolescent best.\\" Chris Payne, reviewing the album fifteen years later in Billboard, felt the track \\"serves as scintillating sample of the bubblegum angst to come ‚Äî yelped hooks, pogo riffs and drums from Travis Barker that go off like popcorn in the microwave.\\" Kelefa Sanneh, writing for the New Yorker in 2016, describes it as a \\"downright giddy farewell to a \\"nightmare\\" girlfriend.\\" The song's central dog training metaphor has been the subject of criticism. \\"It's a nasty idea but the rest of the song makes it obvious he is the one at heel,\\" wrote Ann Powers in her original review of the album for the New York Times.

Originally opening in 1978 as The Roaring Tiger at Circus World theme park, the roller coaster was purchased in 1991 by Magic Springs, where it reopened as Arkansas Twister on May 30, 1992. It features a and reaches speeds of up to as it travels through the foothills of the Ouachita Mountains. The ride was also known as \\"Florida Hurricane\\" and \\"Michael Jackson's Thrill Coaster\\" over the years. Magic Springs purchased the ride from Boardwalk and Baseball for $10,000, and relocation costs brought the total investment to roughly $900,000. History The roller coaster made its debut in 1978 as The Roaring Tiger at Circus World in Haines City, Florida. Designed by Don Rosser & Associates and renowned coaster engineer Bill Cobb, the ride cost $2.3 million to construct using over a half-million feet of Douglas fir lumber. With of track and speeds originally up to , it was billed as \\"the South's longest and fastest roller coaster\\" by the park. It was famously known as a personal favorite of celebrity Michael Jackson, who visited the park frequently in the 1980s to ride. As Circus World changed ownership several times over the years, the roller coaster was renamed briefly to \\"Michael Jackson's Thrill Coaster\\" and eventually to \\"Florida Hurricane\\" when the park reopened as Boardwalk and Baseball in 1987. Boardwalk and Baseball closed shortly thereafter in 1990, and its rides were either demolished or sold to the highest bidder. Magic Springs and Crystal Falls purchased the Florida Hurricane for $10,000 in 1991, and spent close to $900,000 relocating the ride. On May 30, 1992, the roller coaster opened to the public as \\"Arkansas Twister\\" at Magic Springs amusement park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. For the 2002 season, the park invested $2 million restoring the roller coaster to its original condition when it was located in Florida, modifying the \\"dips\\" to Cobb's original specifications. Ride experience The ride begins as the train exits the station and immediately enters the lift hill. After reaching its peak, the train drops at a 45-degree angle and banks slightly left as it elevates into a short hill, providing riders significant lateral g-force. The track straightens as the train makes a second descent into another short hill which produces an \\"air-time\\" experience. The third hill is followed by a steep climb into the ride's 180-degree turnaround that features brakes to slow the train. On its way back, the train descends from the turnaround into a series of two shorter hills, the second of which banks to the right at its crest. The following hill is larger and sits directly beside the roller coaster's lift hill, with wooden supports surrounding riders as they pass through. The ride's finale features two very short hills and another 180-degree turnaround before the coaster meets the final brake run and returns to the station.

Profile of General Demographic Characteristics: 2000 Lake George began as a lumber settlement founded by George Lake and named for him. It was a station on the Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railway and a post office was established on December 8, 1899 with Edward J. Roys as the first postmaster. Winfield Scott Gerrish is credited with revolutionizing lumbering in Michigan by building a seven-mile-long logging railroad from Lake George to the Muskegon River in Clare County. The area is mostly wooded land with a variety of wildlife, including white-tail deer, wild turkey, pheasant, and other game animals. Fishing is very popular in the area with numerous lakes (10 within a 10-mile radius) containing largemouth bass, perch, bluegill, sunfish, pike, musky, bullhead catfish, and rock bass. The population of the area is somewhat mixed; this includes the original pioneer families, and the tourists who stay there during the summer season in lodges and rented cabins. There are very few jobs in the area, therefore workers commute to places as far as the Midland area. The town has a large bar (the Swiss Inn), a restaurant and a few small stores; the Lake George Grocery and the new Depot. There was an old train depot (no longer standing) where two trains crashed on July 19, 1925 (https://web.archive.org/web/20101216012515/http://michiganrailroads.com/RRHX/Wrecks/ICCReports/AARR- LakeGeorgeMI-1925.pdf). The current \\"Depot\\" party store was originally built in 1937 by John Seats Sr. The post office was also inside the grocery store, run by Lula Seats.

It was a licensed copy of the British Gloster Gambet fighter, built by the Nakajima Aircraft Company for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Approximately 150 were built in total. There were two versions, the A1N1 and A1N2. Development By 1926, the Imperial Japanese Navy's Mitsubishi 1MF fighters (also known as Type 10 Carrier Fighters) were in need of replacement and so it asked three of the leading Japanese aircraft manufacturers, Nakajima, Mitsubishi and Aichi for proposals for a new carrier- based fighter. Nakajima purchased a licence from the British Gloster Aircraft Company for production of the Gloster Gambet. It was a private venture design for a carrier-based derivative of their earlier Gloster Gamecock fighter. The prototype Gambet was built by Gloster and first flew on 12 December 1927. The prototype Gambet was shipped to Japan early in 1928. After modifications were made and it was fitted with a Nakajima-built Bristol Jupiter engine, the Gambet was evaluated by the Japanese navy against competitors from Aichi and Mitsubishi. It proved to be more manoeuvrable while still being a stable gun platform and was selected in April 1929 for production as the Navy Type 3 Carrier Fighter, with the short designation A1N1. 50 A1N1s were built. The A1N2 used the 336 kW (450 hp) Nakajima Kotobuki 2 engine, and was introduced in 1930. Production of approximately 100 was completed by 1932. Design The Gambet was a single-seat, single-bay biplane, of all-wooden construction and powered by an air-cooled Bristol Jupiter radial engine. While similar to the Gamecock, it was fitted with longer-span wings, internal flotation bags and arrestor hooks for carrier operations. Operational history The A1N1 entered service in 1929, replacing the Mitsubishi 1-MF. It served on the carriers , , and . The improved A1N2 entered service in 1930, with production continuing until 1932. The A1N flew from the carriers H≈çsh≈ç and Kaga during the Shanghai Incident in 1932 between Japan and China. A1Ns from Kaga scored the Imperial Japanese Navy's first air-to-air combat victory on 22 February 1932 when they shot down a Boeing P-12 (specifically a Model 218, Prototype of the P-12E/F4B-3 variant, after evaluation sold to the Chinese Air Force.) flown by the American volunteer pilot Robert Short.

The species is endemic to Japan, where it is known as , literally meaning \\"giant pepper fish\\". With a length of up to ,Andrias japonicus - Amphibiaweb it is the third-largest salamander in the world, only being surpassed by the very similar and closely related Chinese giant salamander (A. davidianus) and South China giant salamander (A. sligoi). There are currently only five known members of the family Cryptobranchidae: the Japanese, Chinese, and South China giant salamanders, an undescribed Andrias species from eastern China, and the hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis). Japanese giant salamanders are widespread across rivers in southwestern Japan. The species frequently hybridizes with Chinese giant salamanders, which were introduced to the area. Description The Japanese giant salamander can grow to a length of and a weight of . The largest wild specimen on record weighed and was long.Tochimoto, pers. com> It is the second largest amphibian in the world, only smaller than its close relative, the Chinese giant salamander. The brown and black mottled skin of A. japonicus provides camouflage against the bottoms of streams and rivers. It has very small eyes with no eyelids and poor eye sight. Its mouth extends across the width of its head, and can open to the width of its body. A. japonicus possesses large skin folds on its neck that effectively increase its overall body surface area. This assists in epidermal gas exchanges, which in turn regulates carbon dioxide and oxygen exchange with the water. Capillaries in the surface of the skin facilitate this gas exchange. The Japanese giant salamander can be distinguished from the Chinese giant salamander by the arrangement of tubercles on the head and throat. The tubercles are larger and more numerous compared to the mostly single and irregularly scattered tubercles of the Chinese giant salamander. The snout is also more rounded, and the tail is slightly shorter.http://amphibiaweb.org/species/3859 There is no visual external sexual dimorphism. Behavior Japanese giant salamanders in Kyoto Aquarium Andrias japonicus skull The Japanese giant salamander is restricted to streams with clear, cool water. Due to its large size and lack of gills, it is confined to flowing water where oxygen is abundant. it is entirely aquatic and almost entirely nocturnal. Unlike other salamanders, which lose their gills early in their lifecycles, it only breaches its head above the surface to obtain air without venturing out of the water and onto land. The salamander absorbs oxygen through its skin, which has many folds to increase surface area. When threatened, the Japanese giant salamander can excrete a strong-smelling, milky substance with an odor resembling Japanese pepper (hence its common Japanese name, giant pepper fish). It has very poor eyesight, and possesses special sensory cells covering its skin, running from head to toe, the lateral line system. These sensory cells' hair-like shapes detect minute vibrations in the environment, and are quite similar to the hair cells of the human inner ear. This feature is essential for hunting prey due to its poor eyesight. It feeds mainly on insects, frogs and fish. It has a very slow metabolism and can sometimes go for weeks without eating. It lacks natural competitors. It is a long-lived species, with the captive record being an individual that lived in the Natura Artis Magistra, the Netherlands, for 52 years. In the wild, it may live for nearly 80 years.  Lifecycle  The Japanese giant salamander remains in bodies of water its entire life. During mating season in late August, sexually mature adults go upstream into the mountains to spawn and lay eggs. Large males guard a den and are known as denmasters. They mate with several females throughout the season. Smaller males who do not have a den may attempt to enter the den and fertilize some of the eggs. The male releases milt over the eggs laid by the female. The denmaster displays parental care by guarding the eggs and fanning water over them with his tail to increase oxygen flow. Larvae emerge from the fertilized eggs. The larvae then develop gills and limbs, then lose their gills once they metamorphose into adults. The Asa Zoo of Japan was the first organization to successfully breed Japanese giant salamanders in captivity. Several of their offspring were given to the National Zoo of the United States to establish a breeding program. The Hanzaki Institute of Japan has since successfully bred Japanese giant salamanders using the Asa zoo's methods of creating artificial dens.  History  The Japanese giant salamander was first catalogued by Europeans when the resident physician of Dejima Island in Nagasaki, Philipp Franz von Siebold, captured an individual and shipped it back to Leiden in the Netherlands, in the 1820s. The species was designated as a special natural monument in 1951, and is federally protected.  Status  The Japanese giant salamander is threatened by pollution, habitat loss (among other changes, by the silting up of the rivers where it lives), and overcollection. River disturbance has led to fewer appropriate nesting sites and dams block migration paths. It is considered Near Threatened by IUCN, and is included on CITES Appendix I. It can be found on the islands of Kyushu, Honshu, and Shikoku in Japan. In the past, they were fished out of rivers and streams as a source of food, but hunting has ceased because of protection acts. The Japanese giant salamander has been federally protected as a special natural monument by the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs since 1952 due to its cultural and educational significance.  Cultural references  Ukiyo-e print by Utagawa Kuniyoshi depicting a giant salamander being stabbed by the samurai Hanagami Danj≈ç no j≈ç Arakage The Japanese giant salamander has been the subject of legend and artwork in Japan, for example, in the ukiyo-e work by Utagawa Kuniyoshi. The well-known Japanese mythological creature known as the kappa may be inspired by the Japanese giant salamander.\\"River Monsters\\" programme 6 Series 3 directed by Duncan Chard, screened in UK on ITV1 14.02.2012 at 19.30 There is a giant salamander festival every year on August 8 in Yubara, Maniwa City, Okayama prefecture to honour the animal and celebrate its life. The giant salamanders are called \\"Hanzaki\\" in Yubara, due to the belief that even if they are ripped in half (han) they continue to survive. There are two giant salamander floats: a dark male and a red female.

The park is and is located in east-central Denver. The park contains the Denver Zoo, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Ferril and Duck Lakes, and a boathouse. City Park is also the name of the neighborhood that contains the park, though the park is the vast majority of the neighborhood. To the immediate north of the park is the City Park Golf Course. City Park is the largest park in Denver. Geography The City Park neighborhood highlighted on this map of Denver's neighborhoods The park is located in east-central Denver slightly more than a mile east of downtown. The park is a mile long and three-quarters of a mile wide. The park's boundaries are: * West-York Street * South-17th Avenue * East-Colorado Boulevard * North-23rd Avenue. The City Park neighborhood has the same boundaries except for having Colfax Avenue as its southern boundary, which is two blocks south of 17th Avenue. Therefore, the entirety of the neighborhood is only two blocks wide, but about a mile long. The area in the southwest corner of the neighborhood consists of East High School and a green area called the City Park Esplanade, which in some ways extends the park south two blocks to Colfax Avenue. The eastern part of the neighborhood around Colfax Avenue (along with parts of the Congress Park neighborhood across Colfax) is also known as the \\"Bluebird District\\", for the Bluebird Theatre located on Colfax and the urban developments around that area. There is also a neighborhood called \\"City Park West\\", which is located just west of the park to Downing Street and commonly known as Uptown. It has the same southern and northern borders as City Park, and has York Street as its eastern border. History Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. statue in City Park, Denver When Denver was founded in 1858, it was little more than a mining camp. By the 1870s however, Denver had gained a substantial permanent population, and many residents were clamoring for parks. In 1878, the Colorado state legislature passed a bill to allow Denver to acquire of state land to build parks. City Park became the largest tract turned into a park. The initial park layout was designed by Henry Meryweather in 1882 in the tradition of both English pastoral gardens and Central Park in New York City with a flowing, casual design. The 1893 World's Fair started the City Beautiful movement, which further developed the design. The park was irrigated with water from the city ditch. City Park is also one of the oldest public spaces in Denver. The park grew out of the social and cultural atmosphere of the late 19th century as Denver residents, business-owners, garden clubs and politicians rallied for the improvement of the dry and dusty Queen City of the Plains. The idea of an ‚Äúeast city park‚Äù linked to a ‚Äúwest city park‚Äù by a chain of tree-lined parkways first emerged in 1878. In 1882 Henry Meryweather prepared the park's earliest layout and landscape design. His concept followed the precepts of Frederick Law Olmsted, but it was park commissioner Richard Sopris, who managed the park from 1881 to 1891, who is considered the father of the park. Construction of the park began in 1886 with ‚Äúa sinuous tangle of winding carriageways, walks and promenades‚Äù put into place. The arrangement of roads and walks gave the park its pastoral feel, many of which are still in place today. After the turn-of-the-century the park benefitted from the city's investment in the City Beautiful concept. The park was linked, as originally envisioned, to a wider system of parks using parkways and grand boulevards. During this period monumental sculpture was also introduced, consistent with City Beautiful philosophy, including the McLellan Gateway, the Sopris Gateway, the Monti Gateway, the Sullivan Gateway, and the Thatcher Memorial Fountain, which mark park entrances. Ferril Lake and the Museum of Nature and Science During the first half of the twentieth century a series of designers influenced and enhanced the park, including Reinhard Schuetze, S.R. DeBoer, George Kessler, Charles Robinson and the Olmstead brothers (the sons of Frederick Law Olmsted). S.R. DeBoer is recognized as the most influential, as his tenure as city landscape architect spanned almost fifty years, influencing that Park through 1960. Changes after 1960 included significant expansions by the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature & Science (then the Natural History Museum). Both institutions have long histories in the park and contribute significantly to its character and use. In the 1980s a concerted effort to document the history and design of the park led to a compilation of all city records on the park, and ultimately the National Register listing. The period of significance for the National Register listing is 1880 to 1936, but the multi-property form does not define a specific period of significance for City Park alone, and ends in 1936 because it was fifty years before the listing date, 1986. City Park overlooking Ferril Lake and downtown Denver In the 1990s the park Pavilion was designated in a small local historic district, and the Graham-Bible House, once home to the park's caretaker, along with a historic firehouse located in the park, were also designated local landmarks. In 1997 traffic and parking issues in the park led to a concerted planning effort to address land use, circulation and preservation. The City & County of Denver Parks & Recreation Department hosted numerous community meetings, and along with the efforts of a stakeholder group, created the 2001 City Park Master Plan, titled ‚ÄúRevitalizing the Legacy of City Park.‚Äù The Master Plan included a Historic Site Assessment, in which the park's contributing and non- contributing features were carefully researched and evaluated. Since 2001, the Department of Parks & Recreation has implemented many of the recommendations of this plan, including restoring sculptures and fountains, improving conditions at Ferril Lake and Duck Lake, and working with the park's institutions to create parking solutions. The boat pavilion's western facade By the start of the 20th century, Ferril Lake, the Denver Zoo, and the landmark boat pavilion, with a Spanish-style design by architects John Humphreys and William Fisher were all developed in the park. Reinhard Schuetze, a German immigrant who was the head landscaper for Denver, formalized the design of the park by planting of formal gardens, laying down graceful carriage ways, and creating the East High School Esplanade into the park. In 1903, construction was completed for the first wing of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, which was built on the eastern edge of the park on the highest elevation in the park (now famous for its views of downtown and the mountains behind them).Peters, Bette. Denver's City Park. University of Colorado, Denver Dept. of History ¬© 1986 It opened to the public on July 1, 1908. On April 23, 1916, The Shakespeare Elm was planted near the intersection of 17th Avenue and Colorado Boulevard. A plaque at its base reads \\"Shakespeare Elm: The scion from which this tree was grown was taken from the tree at Shakespeare's grave at Stratford-on-Avon\\". City Park sat a mile away from the rest of Denver when it was first opened. Competing trolley companies took park-goers along the undeveloped roads into the park. The neighborhood developed around the park, starting with farmers and squatters who used the city ditch to irrigate their crops. It wasn't until the start of the 20th century with better trolley connections that housing development occurred in force. The neighborhood includes East High School, a landmark built in 1925, which is Denver's first high school (moved from downtown). The neighborhood also contains many historic brick residential buildings, including many Denver square style homes and several historic brick commercial structures, especially along Colfax Avenue. Today paddle boats on Ferril Lake Colfax in the City Park neighborhood in particular, has become a popular area with many hip restaurants, stores, and other businesses, including the newest location of the Tattered Cover bookstore and Twist & Shout record store, just across from the neighborhood. The neighborhood has also seen new residential and commercial developments, including the twin towers of the Pinnacle at the former site of Mercy Hospital. City Park itself is still the premier park in the city. Thousands of visitors continue to see not only the park itself but the cultural institutions contained within. The park holds a free summer concert series, and has boat rentals, both standard paddle-boats and some shaped like various water creatures like pelicans and ducks. The boathouse can also be rented for events. Ferril Lake includes the Prismatic Fountain which dates back to 1908. Originally designed by engineer Frederic W. Darlington and was a revolutionary feature for the time. The recently renovated fountain now boasts LED lights which cycle through different formations, with each cycle spanning an hour.

In 1854, it became the Orange Free State, and is now the Free State province of South Africa. History On 8 December 1845 Captain William Sutton was appointed ‚ÄúBritish Resident among the tribes living beyond the Frontier to the North-East‚Äù (relative to Cape Colony). Sutton was succeeded as Resident on 16 January 1846 by Captain Henry Douglas Warden, who bought the farm Bloemfontein from a Griqua farmer to establish the capital. Warden was soon promoted to Major, and in March 1849 he was succeeded at Bloemfontein as civil commissioner by Mr C U Stuart, but he remained British resident until July 1852. Sir Harry Smith proclaimed British sovereignty over Transorangia on 3 February 1848. A nominated legislative council was created, a high court established and other steps taken for the orderly government of the country, which was officially styled the Orange River Sovereignty. In October 1849 King Moshoeshoe I was induced to sign a new arrangement considerably curtailing the boundaries of the Basuto reserve. The frontier towards the Sovereignty was thereafter known as the Warden line. A little later the reserves of other chieftains were precisely defined.Chisholm 1911, p. 155. The British Resident had, however, no force sufficient to maintain his authority, and Moshoeshoe and all the neighbouring clans became involved in hostilities with one another and with the Europeans. In 1851 Moshoeshoe joined the republican party in the Sovereignty in an invitation to Andries Pretorius to recross the Vaal. The intervention of Pretorius resulted in the Sand River Convention of 1852, which acknowledged the independence of the Transvaal but left the status of the Sovereignty untouched. The British government (under the first Russell administration), which had reluctantly agreed to the annexation of the country, had, however, already repented its decision and had resolved to abandon the Sovereignty. Earl Grey, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, in a dispatch to Sir Harry Smith dated 21 October 1851, declared: ‚ÄúThe ultimate abandonment of the Orange Sovereignty should be a settled point in our policy.‚Äù A meeting of representatives of all European inhabitants of the Sovereignty, elected on manhood suffrage, held at Bloemfontein in June 1852, nevertheless declared in favour of the retention of British rule. Henry Green was appointed British Resident on 3 July 1852 in place of Warden, who had been dismissed.Theal 1893, p. 495. At the close of that year a settlement was at length concluded with Moshoeshoe, which perhaps left that chief in a stronger position than he had hitherto been. There had been ministerial changes in England and the Aberdeen ministry, then in power, adhered to the determination to withdraw from the Sovereignty. Sir George Russell Clerk was sent out in 1853 as special commissioner ‚Äúfor the settling and adjusting of the affairs‚Äù of the Sovereignty, and in August of that year he summoned a meeting of delegates to determine upon a form of self- government. At that time there were some 15,000 Europeans in the country, many of them recent immigrants from Cape Colony. There were among them numbers of farmers and tradesmen of British descent. The majority of the whites still wished for the continuance of British rule provided that it was effective and the country guarded against its enemies. The representations of their delegates, who drew up a proposed constitution retaining British control, were unavailing. Sir George Clerk announced that, as the elected delegates were unwilling to take steps to form an independent government, he would enter into negotiations with other persons. ‚ÄúAnd then,‚Äù wrote George McCall Theal, ‚Äúwas seen the strange spectacle of an English commissioner of high rank and courteous demeanour addressing men who wished to be free of British control as the friendly and well-disposed inhabitants, while for those who desired to remain British subjects and who claimed that protection to which they believed themselves entitled, he had no sympathising word.‚ÄùTheal 1893, pp. 531‚Äì532. While the elected delegates sent two members to England to try to induce the government to alter their decision, Sir George Clerk speedily came to terms with a committee formed by the republican party and presided over by Mr J H Hoffman. Even before this committee met, a royal proclamation had been signed (30 January 1854) ‚Äúabandoning and renouncing all dominion‚Äù in the Sovereignty. The Orange River Convention, recognising the independence of the country, was signed at Bloemfontein on 23 February 1854 by Sir George Clerk and the republican committee, and in March the Boer government assumed office. Five days later the representatives of the elected delegates had an interview in London with the colonial secretary, the Duke of Newcastle, who informed them that it was now too late to discuss the question of the retention of British rule. The colonial secretary added that it was impossible for England to supply troops to constantly advancing outposts, ‚Äúespecially as Cape Town and the port of Table Bay were all she really required in South Africa‚Äù. In withdrawing from the Sovereignty the British government declared that it had ‚Äúno alliance with any native chief or tribes to the northward of the Orange River with the exception of the Griqua chief Captain Adam Kok [III]‚Äù. Kok was not formidable in a military sense, nor could he prevent individual Griquas from alienating their lands. Eventually, in 1861, he sold his sovereign rights to the Free State for ¬£4,000 and moved with his followers to the northern part of the Mpondo king Faku‚Äôs No Man‚Äôs Land, later called Griqualand East.

It was designed and built by Mitsubishi and used in combat against China. The aircraft was used by the air services of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army. Development While working with the Mitsubishi company, the British aircraft designer Herbert Smith designed the 2MT1 two-seat biplane torpedo bomber which flew for the first time in January 1923. It went into Japanese Navy service as the Type 13-1 carrier-borne attack aircraft or B1M1, and was followed by the 2MT2 and 2MT3 variants (also designated B1M1). The redesigned Type 13-2 was designated B1M2. The final version, the Type 13-3 or B1M3, had the company designation 3MT2 and was a three-seater. Total production was 443. The B1M was powered by a Napier Lion or Hispano-Suiza engine according to version. Operational history left The type entered service in 1924 and served into the 1930s, 32 flying from the aircraft carriers and during the Shanghai Incident in 1932. An aircraft from Kaga was lost during an aerial engagement between an American air force adviser and demonstration pilot to the Chinese government, Robert Short, who also lost his life, and regarded as a hero defending the Chinese city against the Japanese aircraft.

The band got its name from a wooden storage box owned by Jacobs that had \\"Woods Tea Co.\\" printed on its side. Mike Lussen joined the band several years later. Morgan left the band in the early 1990s. Howard Wooden officially joined the band in 1992, and Tom MacKenzie a year later. In 2000, MacKenzie left, and was replaced by Chip Chase. The band became a regular feature at Colgate University, where the students knew the band's material. Between songs, students often shout 'Arrgh!' to poke fun at the group's sea shanties. To honor this, MacKenzie wrote a song called \\"Aargh!\\" for the students.Woods Tea Co. Live! CD. 1999. Tracks 7, 8. The band suffered several losses in its third decade.

At 11 minutes and 35 seconds, it was the longest popular music song at the time and the first extended rock improvisation released by a major recording act.  Writing and recording  Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, \\"Goin' Home\\" is a long blues-inspired track that is notable as one of the first songs by a rock and roll band to break the ten-minute mark and the longest recorded song on any Stones album. While many bands had experimented with length in live performances, and Bob Dylan had written many songs by this point which reached the five/six-minute mark, \\"Goin' Home\\" was the first \\"jam\\" recorded expressly for an album. In an interview with the magazine Rolling Stone, Richards said: Jack Nitzsche, a regular Stones contributor throughout the 1960s, here performs percussion. The song, while lengthy, is built around a common theme, as opposed to later Stones songs of great length like \\"Midnight Rambler\\" or \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" which are divided into distinct sections punctuated by differing instrumentations. \\"Goin' Home\\" plays as a long jam, eventually deconstructing Richards' guitar piece, Jagger's lyrics, and Watts' drum lines which build in power as the song progresses.

Rudolph Loewenstein Biography Loewenstein was born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland (then in the Russian Empire), to a Jewish family from the province of Galicia. After studying medicine in Poland, he moved to Zurich, apparently to flee antisemitism, and began new medical studies, specializing in neurology and studying under Eugen Bleuler. At this time he became acquainted with psychoanalysis. He then moved to Berlin where he was certified as a psychoanalyst after undergoing a training analysis with Hanns Sachs. He became a member of the German Psychoanalytic Society (DPG)i.e. the Deutsche Psychoanalytische Gesellschaft. in 1925.Peter Gay, Freud (1989) p. 461Elisabeth Roudinesco, Histoire de la Psychanalyse en France / Jacques Lacan, Ed. du Livre de Poche, 2010, p. 458.Elisabeth Roudinesco, Dictionnaire de la psychanalyse, Paris: Fayard, 2011 (originally published 1997), p. 936-937. At the request of Sigmund Freud, Loewenstein moved to Paris, France in 1925 in order to train new analysts. He was the second licensed psychoanalyst, after Eugenie Sokolnicka, to practice there. He trained most of the first two generations of French analysts, including, notably, Jacques Lacan (between 1933 and 1939). He was a founding member and also secretary of the first French psychoanalytic society, the Soci√©t√© psychanalytique de Paris (SPP). (Some of the other founding members included Ren√© Laforgue, Marie Bonaparte, Raymond de Saussure, and Angelo Hesnard.) In 1927, he participated in the creation of the SPP's journal, the ; and in 1928 he and Marie Bonaparte translated Freud's case-study of Dora into French.Roudinesco, op. cit., p. 447, 458 ff., 462. In 1930, he became a French citizen and obtained his medical license anew - defending his thesis for a doctorate in medicine in 1935. In 1939, he was mobilized as a doctor in the French army. After the Armistice, he fled to the south of France, and in 1942 left there for the United States, where he settled in New York.Roudinesco, op. cit. p. 463 There he pursued a distinguished institutional career with the International Psychoanalytic Association (IPA), becoming its vice president from 1965 to 1967.

He was named by Topps as their left-handed rookie pitcher of the year in 1977. Early life and professional baseball Theodore Jared Garvin was born on October 21, 1955 in Oakland, California. His family later moved to Merced, California where he played baseball for Merced High School. He was initially drafted by the Baltimore Orioles of the American League (AL) in the 17th round of the 1973 Major League Baseball Draft that was held on June 5, but he did not sign a contract with the team. He re-entered the draft in time for the January secondary draft held on January 9, when he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins, also of the AL. He signed with the Twins franchise and was assigned to the class-A Wisconsin Rapids Twins of the Midwest League. Major league career Garvin began his pitching career with four wins by the end of April, the first rookie to do so in baseball history. He was battling influenza when he was defeated by the Yankees on June 30, his fourth consecutive loss. He finished the season with a record of 10-18, and became known for his ability to pick off runners at first. In fact, Garvin established an unofficial Major League record of 26 pickoffs in the 1977 season, although this was not recognized in the record books; official statistics had never distinguished between pickoffs and runners caught stealing by any other method. His 34 games started stands as the Blue Jays' rookie record, though tied by Gustavo Chac√≠n in 2006. He surrendered 33 home runs during the season, the most allowed by a Blue Jays pitcher until Woody Williams allowed 36 in 1998. Garvin fell to 4-12 in 1978, and by 1979 was primarily a reliever. In September 1979, Garvin spent some time on the disabled list, re-activated on September 1. Garvin re-signed with the Blue Jays on January 20, 1981, after appearing in a club record 61 games in 1980. On August 20, 1982, the Blue Jays re-activated outfielder Wayne Nordhagen from the disabled list. To clear a spot for him, they optioned Garvin to the franchises' class-AAA team, the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League. At the time of the demotion, Garvin was the franchise's all-time leader in pitching appearances with 194. He was recalled to the majors for two more games in late September. On January 18, 1983, Garvin was sold by the Blue Jays to the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League for an undisclosed amount, and was assigned to their class-AAA team, the Louisville Redbirds of the American Association. However, he was cut from the roster during spring training, and ended his professional career without ever playing for the Redbirds. After his playing days, he has become involved in the real estate business.

The song is a reflection of American lifestyles and life in 1970s-era New York City, but also influences from the English punk rock movement can be heard. History Recorded from October to December 1977, \\"Shattered\\" features lyrics sung in sprechgesang by Jagger on a guitar riff by Keith Richards. Jagger commented in a Rolling Stone interview that he wrote the lyrics in the back of a New York cab. Most of Richards' guitar work is a basic rhythmic pattern strumming out the alternating tonic and dominant chords with each bar, utilising a relatively modest phaser sound effect for some added depth. Due to the absence of bassist Bill Wyman, the bass track is played by Ronnie Wood. Billboard stated that the \\"heavy bottom and...frenetic vocals translate New York's neurotic energy to music.\\" \\"Shattered\\" was released as a single in the United States with cover art by illustrator Hubert Kretzschmar and in 1979 climbed to number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Silver Age story The original Superman-Red/Superman-Blue tale is an \\"Imaginary Story\\" that first appeared in Superman #162 (July 1963). The script was written by Leo Dorfman, with art by Curt Swan. In the story, Superman is compelled to finish a list of unaccomplished goals, including the enlargement of the Bottle City of Kandor and eliminating crime and evil from Earth. In order to accomplish these goals, Superman invents a machine, powered by various types of kryptonite, that will increase his intelligence. The machine works, increasing Superman's intelligence a hundredfold, but with the unexpected side effect of splitting Superman into twin beings, one outfitted in an all-red Superman costume and the other in an all-blue version. The twins name themselves Superman-Red and Superman-Blue. Supergirl is introduced to Superman-Red and Superman-Blue. Art by Curt Swan. The Supermen, using their enhanced intellects, first repair Brainiac's \\"enlarging ray\\". They then create a means to bring all the fragments of Krypton together, creating a \\"New Krypton\\" (eliminating all existing kryptonite in the process), and successfully enlarge Kandor on its surface, freeing its citizens from their bottle prison. At the urging of Lori Lemaris, the Supermen create an underwater world for the citizens of Atlantis and arrange an interstellar voyage to transport them to their new home. The two Supermen go on to create an \\"anti-evil\\" ray which can cure criminal tendencies in anyone. They place the ray into satellites in orbit around the Earth, curing not only villains such as Lex Luthor and Mr. Mxyzptlk, but reforming Communists such as Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel Castro. The reformed Luthor goes on to invent a serum that cures all known diseases, which the Supermen put into the water supply. Supergirl then releases the Phantom Zone inmates, also reformed by the ray, and they immigrate to New Krypton in a spaceship provided by the Legion of Super-Heroes. With nearly all of the world's problems solved, the two Supermen now have the opportunity to deal with personal matters. The split allows them to resolve the love triangle between Superman, Lois Lane, and Lana Lang. Superman-Red proposes to Lois, while Superman-Blue asks Lana to marry him. Each woman claims her own Superman, and they have a triple wedding: Superman-Blue and Lana, Superman-Red and Lois, and Lucy Lane marrying Jimmy Olsen (since Lucy need no longer wait for Lois to marry before she does). Red decides to live on New Krypton with Lois, renouncing his powers and raising a family, while Blue remains on Earth and retires to devote his life to scientific research and starting a Super- family of his own. Superman-Red and Superman-Blue appeared again in a story written by Bob Rozakis and Paul Kupperberg and illustrated by Adrian Gonzales and Vince Colletta and first published in German in Superman Album No. 1 in West Germany in 1981. The story was published in English in 1982 in the oversized Superman Spectacular (an unnumbered one-shot in the United States but published as No. 1 in a series in The United Kingdom.) In this story, red kryptonite causes Superman to be temporarily split into Superman-Red and Superman-Blue and the two Supermen battle Lex Luthor and Terra-Man. Superman- Red and Superman-Blue appear in a panel in Infinite Crisis #5, when Alexander Luthor, Jr. is trying to fuse the many alternate Supermen. Modern Age story The second incarnation of Superman Red and Superman Blue began in a 1998 storyline. While temporarily deprived of the solar energy required to give him powers, Superman had developed energy-based abilities,Superman (vol. 2) #122 (April 1997) which eventually forced him to adopt a blue and white containment suit to prevent the energy dispersing. While retaining most of his abilities, he could now also sense different kinds of energy, including the trail of radioactivity from a passing van, bolts of electricity and magnetic tractor beams rather than his original heat vision. He was also able to absorb the radiation, although this was incredibly painful. He also gained the ability to turn his powers \\"off,\\" though this took time to control as he inadvertently fried a toaster at home. This switch to Clark Kent also left him as vulnerable as a normal human, which was a bit of a surprise to him when he stubbed his toe while answering the phone. In the Superman Red/Superman Blue one-shot (February 1998), a trap created by the Cyborg Superman working with Toyman, caused Superman to split into two beings who represented different aspects of his personality, though each believed himself to be the original. Superman Blue was the more cerebral entity, preferring to think his way out of situations and actually solve problems with his mind as well as his powers. Superman Red was more rash, but also more decisive, preferring action over taking the time to think. Over time, these two personalities grew more and more polarized and individual, to the point that neither entity wanted to become one Superman again.Superman (vol. 2) #134 (April 1998)The Man of Steel #79 (May 1998) Both Supermen deeply loved Lois Lane; unlike in the earlier Red/Blue story, there was not another love interest for one of the Supermen to pair up with. Instead, they fought over Lois' affections, each with almost no consideration for her feelings; Lois lost her tolerance for this and essentially kicked them both out of the house until they could figure out how to unite.Man of Tomorrow #10 (Summer 1998) Perplexed, both Red and Blue flew to Antarctica to see if Kryptonian technology could solve the issue, but were met by a woman named Obsession, who had previously shown an incredible level of romantic lust for Superman. Then Maxima, another superpowered female admirer of Superman's (only this one was far more volatile), stepped in. While Obsession liked the idea of two Supermen, Maxima found the existence of two utterly unacceptable. A fight broke out between the women when Obsession offered to share them with the Amazon from Almerac, insulting Maxima's royal sensibilities. Superman Red and Superman Blue separated and reprimanded the combatants. Following a battle with the Millennium Giants (Cabraca, Cerne and Sekhmet), the two Supermen merged and Superman returned to his normal powers and original costume.Superman (vol. 2) #135 (May 1998) The new status quo was established in a special one-shot, Superman: Forever, in June 1998. The explanation is vague; Superman felt he was \\"rewarded\\" for saving the world, although he later claimed that he returned to normal when his electromagnetic energy dispersed.JLA (vol. 1) #20 (July 1998) Although Superman briefly returned to his electric-blue form when facing Brainiac-13 after he was apparently absorbed by Brainiac's energy conduits while trying to disrupt his power supply,Superman (vol. 2) #154 (March 2000) this was revealed to be the result of Brainiac 2.5‚ÄìBrainiac-13's past self, hiding in Lena Luthor to avoid being deleted by his future selfAdventures of Superman #576 (March 2000)‚Äìcreating the electric Superman based on scans taken of Superman in that form, intercepting B-13's attempt to absorb Superman and uploading Superman's mind into the electric body to keep Brainiac-13 occupied while Superman's true body was restored in a LexCorp facility.

The weapon even did the same thing to Wonder Woman, Batman and Luthor, and the reds plotted to affect the entire world, except for Luthor Red, who was actually good and returned everything to normal.

The book, which is semi-autobiographical in nature, is set in Allison's hometown of Greenville, South Carolina in the 1950s. Narrated by Ruth Anne \\"Bone\\" Boatwright, the primary conflict occurs between Bone and her mother's husband, Glen Waddell. The novel examines the complexities of mother-child relationships, conditions of class, race, and sexuality. All in which play out in Bone's life and her relationships with others. The book was adapted into a film in 1996.  Plot  The book opens with Bone relating the details of her birth. Bone's 15-year-old mother Anney gives birth to her after being seriously injured in a car accident. Anney, who is comatose during the delivery, is unable to lie about being married. Her mother and older sister Ruth attempt to give a false name and are caught in their deception. This results in Bone being declared a bastard (an illegitimate child; born out of wedlock). Anney, who \\"hated to be called trash\\", then spends the next two years unsuccessfully petitioning to get a new birth certificate issued without the word \\"illegitimate‚Äù stamped on it. This opens her up to the ridicule of the customers in the diner in which she works. At age 17, Anney marries Lyle Parsons and gives birth to another daughter, Reese, in short order. Lyle is killed in a car accident, leaving Anney \\"all bitter grief and hunger\\". After remaining single for a few years she begins to date Glen Waddell, the son of a socially prominent dairy owner. Two years later, as a result of her becoming pregnant, they get married. Anney gives birth to a stillborn boy and becomes unable to have more children. During labor, Glen masturbates while touching Bone in the car. The family's fortunes plummet, with Glen losing job after job due to his anger management problems. It is then that Glen begins sexually molesting her. The abuse culminates in beatings and whippings that leave Bone nursing bruises and broken bones. When Anney discovers the abuse, she leaves Glen, who promptly promises never to do it again. Anney takes him back and the abuse resumes. Anney leaves Glen again after her tough, hard-drinking brothers severely beat Glen upon discovering that he has beaten Bone once again. Bone then announces to her mother that she will never live in the same house with Glen again. Bone tells her mother that she loves her and will forgive her if she decides to go back to Glen, reiterating that she will not return to the house with Glen. Her mother then vows not to go back to Glen unless Bone comes with her. When Glen discovers this, he attacks Bone at her Aunt Alma's house, breaking her arm and raping her on the kitchen floor. Anney walks in on him and fights him off. Glen follows the two out to the car, begging Anney to kill him rather than abandon him. To Bone's disgust and amazement, Anney ends up crying and throwing her arms around Glen. Bone's aunt Raylene visits her at the hospital and takes custody of Bone, as Anney has disappeared. While Bone is recuperating at her aunt's house, Anney shows up with a new birth certificate for Bone, this time without the word \\"illegitimate\\" stamped on the bottom. She asks Bone's forgiveness and leaves without telling her where she is going. Reviews * In the July 5, 1992, edition of The New York Times Book Review, George Garrett said the book \\"in no way seems to be a patchwork of short stories linked together. Everything, each part, belongs only to the novel\\" and \\"close to flawless\\". He compared it to J.D. Salinger's novel Catcher in the Rye and Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird, writing, \\"Special qualities of her style include a perfect ear for speech and its natural rhythms; an unassertive, cumulative lyricism; an intensely imagined and presented sensory world, with all five senses working together; and, above all, again and again a language for the direct articulation of deep and complex feelings.\\" * K. K. Roeder in the April 1991 publication of San Francisco Review of Books states that Allison: \\"relates the difficulty of Bone's struggles with intensity, humor, and hard-wrought rejection of self- pity, rendering Bastard a rare achievement among works of fiction dealing with abused children.\\" See also *Illegitimacy in fiction References 1992 American novels American autobiographical novels American bildungsromans American novels adapted into films Dutton Penguin books Fiction set in the 1950s Novels set in South Carolina Working-class literature Domestic violence in fiction Novels about rape 1992 debut novels ","title":"Bastard Out of Carolina"},{"id":"6326831","text":"The Ghorawadi caves, also known as Ghoradeshwar caves or Shelarwadi caves, are around 25 km northwest of Pune, India, were originally Buddhist caves, and now contain carvings and statues of Buddhist and Hindu deities. They are close to the NH4 highway connecting Pune and Mumbai. The caves were carved out of a single rock formation around the 3rd and 4th century CE. There are nine rooms for meditation adjoining the chaityagriha. An inscription in BrƒÅhmƒ´ script on one of the walls says that the Chaityagriha is dedicated with affection to the Buddha and the Samgha by the daughters of \\"Dhapar\\", who was a disciple of \\"Bhadantsingh\\". The chaityagriha is now known as Shri Ghorwadeshwar Temple. The caves are situated at the top of a hill. Several caves contain representations of deities including Vitthal, Rakhumai and Saint Tukaram. It is said that Saint Tukaram used to meditate at Ghorawadi caves and also at places like Durga Tekdi near Nigdi, Bhandara and Bhamchandra near Dehu. A large cave contains a representation of Shivlinga that is visited during Mahashivratri by people seeking the blessings of Lord Shiva. Buddhist Legend The caves were earlier known as Chaityagriha or Chaittagriha (in Pali) caves which carried various inscriptions on it by Buddhist scholars stating these caves were built as a sign of affection to Lord Buddha and the Sangha of Buddhist scholar Dhapar.It still contains various ancient Buddhist relics. Some evidences prove the existence of Buddhist Vihara here. Hindu legend Once Buddhism eliminated from Deccan Plateau region during medieval age, Hinduism started its domination here. As per Hindu legends, due to unavoidable situations and disasters including famines, the natural beauty in this region started dying. Rivers died, forests started to burn due to heat and as its effect, the bio diversity here stated to vanish. Unique birds like the Great Indian Bustard of this region started to vanish. In order to prevent this, the people of the villages started to worship Lord Shiva by establishing a shivalinga inside these caves. Even though after severe efforts, here was relief from famines. After all this, in order to protect its clan, a bustard bird started worshipping the Shivalinga. By seeing devotion of an innocent bird to relieve from the disastrous nature, Shiva appeared before the bird and granted him the boon. Today, the Lord here is worshipped as Ghoradeshwar, which is made of two words, Ghorad and Ishwar. The word Ghorad stands for The Indian Busters in Marathi and Ishwar stands for Lord. The word Ghoradeshwar means Lord of the Bustard. 009 Unoccupied Vihara and Cistern (33565064691).jpgUnoccupied Vihara and cistern. 017 Vihara now Occupied (33565047641).jpgVihara, now occupied.

The city and several other places in the district occupy an important place in ancient tradition,De Beth Hillel, David (1832) Travels (Madras publication). folklores and literature of the State of Kerala.Lord, James Henry (1977). The Jews in India and the Far East; Greenwood Press Reprint; . In 1795, the city became capital of the princely state of Travancore. Several historic landmarks of the city, including the Kowdiar Palace, University of Kerala, and Napier Museum were built during this period. After independence, Thiruvanthapuram was made the capital of the state of Kerala. Ancient history Padmanabhaswamy Temple According to legend, the site of Thiruvananthapuram was once a jungle known as Anantan KƒÅdu, which was home to a Pulayar couple who cultivated rice. One day, the wife heard a baby crying as she was weeding. After a search, she found a child so beautiful that she assumed it was divine and was afraid to touch it. She fed the baby some milk and left it in the shade of a tree, whereupon a five headed cobra appeared, moved the baby to a hole in the tree and used its hood to shelter the child from the sun. Realizing it was an incarnation of the Hindu deity Vishnu, the Pulayar and his wife made offerings of milk and congee in a coconut shell. Once the king of Travancore heard of the baby, he issued orders for the construction of a temple at the location as Padmanabha swami temple. The Ays were the leading political power till the beginning of the 10th century AD. During the Chera-Chola Wars from 999 to 1110 AD, the city of significance was Vizhinjam, which housed a university (Kanthalur Salai). Trivandrum housed the famous temple. All of the regions were attacked and sacked by the Chola army, till they were forced to retreat to Kottar in 1110 AD. The disappearance of the Ays synchronised with the emergence of the rulers of Venad. During the Venad rule, the trustees of the temple (Ettarayogam) became powerful enough to challenge the authority of the rulers. Raja Aditya Varma was poisoned by them, and five out of six children of Umayamma Rani were murdered by them. In 1684, during her regency, the English East India Company obtained a sandy piece of land at Anchuthengu (Anjengo) on the sea coast, about 32 km north of Thiruvananthapuram city, for erecting a factory and fortifying it. The place had earlier been frequented by the Portuguese and later by the Dutch. It was from here that the English gradually extended their domain to other parts of Thiruvithamcore, anglicised as Travancore. During the regency of Umayamma Rani, Travancore was invaded by a Mughal adventurer, known as the Mughal Sirdar, forcing the Rani to take refuge in Nedumangad. The Sardar camped in the suburbs of the present day Trivandrum, till he was defeated by Kerala Varma, a prince from the Kottayam royal family, adopted into the Venad royal family. The Rani was brought back in triumph to Trivandrum, but in 1696 AD, Kottayam Kerala Varma was assassinated by the trustees within the precincts of his own palace. During the regin of another Aditya Varma (1718‚Äì1721), the clashes between the royal officials and the temple trustees became more common. Failing to get redress at the hands of the king, the tenants of the temple lands marched to Trivandrum to present their grievances to the Yogakkar (trustees), indicating the low ebb of the power of the king. Modern history Maharaja Marthanda Varma who reigned from 1729 to 1758, and who is regarded as the father of modern Travancore, modernised Thiruvananthapuram. The locals of Thiruvananthapuram supported him against the Ettuveetil Pillamar and Ettara Yogam when he was the heir-apparent, and when he was attacked by the agents of the trustees, he fled to the safety of Trivandrum, from where he counterattacked . During his reign, he renovated the Padmanabhaswamy Temple and the walls of the fortress. He also shifted the capital legally from Padmanabhapuram to Thiruvananthapuram, which he made a great centre of intellectual and artistic activity. In 1791, the English East India Company signed a treaty to protect Travancore from the Kingdom of Mysore and under its terms was allowed to install a Resident and troops in Thiruvananthapuram. In 1799, Velu Thampi Dalawa, then a Karyakar of Talakkulam, led a march of the local people to Thiruvananthapuram to protest against the corruption of the Kings's ministers. The accession of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal who reigned from 1829 to 1847, ushered in an epoch of cultural progress and economic prosperity. The beginning of English education was marked in 1834 by the opening of an English school at Thiruvananthapuram. An observatory and a charity hospital were also established in 1836. During the reign of Maharaja Uthram Thirunal, Rev. Mead, an Anglican priest of the London Missionary Society (L.M.S.), was employed by the Maharajah to improve the quality of education. Schools, including one for girls, were started in Thiruvananthapuram. The Napier Museum was established in 1855. During the reign of Maharaja Moolam Thirunal (1885‚Äì1924), a College of Fine Arts was opened here besides the several English, Malayalam and Tamil schools, all over the State. A large hospital with lying-in-facility and a lunatic asylum were also established in Thiruvananthapuram. The Trivandrum University College was started in 1873, with Dr. Read as its principal. A Law class was opened in Thiruvananthapuram in 1874, and the main building of the old Kerala Government Secretariat was designed and constructed by the Maharajah's chief engineer, Mr. Barton. Mr. Barton also improved the sanitation of the city. It was during the reign of Sri Moolam Thirunal (1885‚Äì1924), that the Sanskrit College, Ayurveda College, Law College and a second grade College for Women were started here. A department for the preservation and publication of oriental manuscripts was also established. One of the significant aspects associated with Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal's reign was the inauguration of the Legislative Council in 1888. This was the first legislative chamber, instituted in an Indian State. The Sri Moolam Assembly came into being in 1904. The activities of the Indian National Congress echoed in Thiruvananthapuram and other parts of Kerala during the reign of Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal. During the regency of Maharani Setu Lakshmi Bai, the college for Women at Trivandrum was raised to the first grade. The Trivandrum International Airport was established in 1932 A political conference of the Congress was held in the city under the presidency of Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramaiah, in 1938. The period of Maharaja Sri Chitra Thirunal Bala Rama Varma who took the reins of administration in 1931, witnessed many-sided progress. The promulgation of the Temple Entry Proclamation (1936) was an act that underlined social emancipation. In 1937, a separate University for Travancore was started. This was later redesignated as the University of Kerala, following the formation of the State of Kerala in 1956.  Post- Independence (1947 CE - present)  With the end of the British rule in 1947, Travancore chose to join the Indian union. The first people-elected ministry headed by Pattom Thanu Pillai was installed in office on 24 March 1948. In 1949, Thiruvananthapuram became the capital of Thiru-Kochi, the state formed by the integration of Travancore with its northern neighbour Kochi. The king of Travancore, Chitra Thirunal Bala Rama Varma, became the Rajpramukh of the Travancore-Cochin Union from 1 July 1949 until 31 October 1956. When the state of Kerala was formed on 1 November 1956, Thiruvananthapuram became its capital. With the establishment of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in 1962, Thiruvananthapuram became the cradle of India's ambitious space programme. The first Indian space rocket was developed and launched from the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in the outskirts of the city in 1963. Several establishments of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) were later established in Thiruvananthapuram. A significant milestone in the city's recent history was the establishment of Technopark‚ÄîIndia's first IT park‚Äîin 1995. Technopark has developed into the largest IT park in the geographical area, employing around 40,000 people in 300 companies.

Halti Beel in Natore District A beel is a billabong or a lake-like wetland with static water (as opposed to moving water in rivers and canals - typically called in Bengali, in the Ganges - Brahmaputra flood plains of the Eastern Indian states of West Bengal, and Assam and in the country of Bangladesh. The term owes its origins to the word of the same pronunciation meaning \\"pond\\" and \\"lake\\" in the Bengali and Assamese languages. Formation Typically, beels are formed by inundation of low-lying lands during flooding, where some water gets trapped even after flood waters recede back from the flood plains. Beels may also be caused by filling up of low-lying areas during rains, especially during the monsoon season. There are different causes for the formation of beels. A string of beels is indicative of there being the remains of a great river that deserted its channel, moving to a new one elsewhere. Haor, baor In north eastern Bangladesh there are large water bodies called haors. A haor is a bowl shaped depression which is flooded every year during monsoon. Throughout the rainy season a haor is such a vast stretch of turbulent water that it is thought of as a sea, within which the villages appear as islands. It remains under water for seven months of the year. During the dry season water drains out leaving small shallow lakes exposing rich soil extensively cultivated for rice. In greater Comilla, Faridpur, Dhaka and Pabna districts the beel is sometimes referred to as baor. Location of important beels=Bangladesh Bangladesh has thousands of beels, with the best-known being Chalan Beel, Gopalganj-Khulna Beel, Meda Beel, Aila beel, Dekhar beel, Kuri beel, Erali beel and Arial Beel.Abdul Wahab Akonda, BANGLADESH , International Water Management Institute; Retrieved: 2007-12-04 In the central part Bangladesh, important beels are Katla, Chatal, Nagarkanda, and Chanda. Most of the large beels have shrunk a great deal in recent decades. Regionwise, in the northwest of Bangladesh some of the larger beels are Bara Beel in Pirganj, Tagrai Beel in Kurigram, Lunipukur in Rangpur, Bara Mirzapur Beel in Narail and Keshpathar in Bogra. The old river course of Atrai has beels. In the southern region of Bangladesh, important beels are Boyra, Dakatia, Bara, Kola, Patla, Chatal and Srirampur. Assam In Assam, Deepor Beel is a permanent, freshwater lake, in a former channel of the Brahmaputra river, to the south of the main river south-west of Guwahati. It has great biological and environmental importance besides being the only major storm water storage basin for the Guwahati city. The beel is endowed with rich floral and faunal diversity. In addition to huge congregation of residential water birds, the Deepor ecosystem harbours large number of migratory waterfowl each year.

Biography A native of K≈çchi Prefecture, Kiyotake graduated from the 26th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1914, and from the 34th class of the Army Staff College in 1922. He spent much of the 1920s and 1930s in a series of staff positions in the North China Area Army and in Japan, before his promotion to major general in 1940.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II In 1940, Kawaguchi was appointed commander of the IJA 35th Infantry Brigade. This was under the direct command of the Southern Army and was formed from units from the IJA 18th Division. Kawaguchi's reinforced brigade made a series of landings in British Borneo in December 1941 and January 1942: at Miri, Kuching, Brunei, Jesselton, Beaufort, Labuan Island and Sandakan. During the later stages of the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, landed at Cebu on March 1942 and Mindanao the following month. As commander of Army forces on Cebu after the invasion of the Philippines in 1942, Kawaguchi objected strenuously to the \\"revenge killings\\" of senior Philippine government officials and supreme court justices by Japanese authorities, most notably Japanese Army Colonel Masanobu Tsuji. He argued that, \\"shooting defeated opponents in cold blood was a violation of the true Bushido.\\" His protests earned him the enmity of Tsuji, who used every opportunity to get Kawaguchi reassigned to combat zones from which he was not likely to return.Harries, Soldiers of the Sun, p. 338. Kawaguchi and his 35th Infantry Brigade, along with other attached units, were landed as reinforcements on Guadalcanal in August and September 1942 in response to the Allied landings on the island. In the resulting Battle of Edson's Ridge on 13 September 1942, Kawaguchi's forces were defeated with heavy losses and forced to retreat from the battlefield. Kawaguchi was subsequently relieved of command during the Japanese preparations for another attack in October 1942 and evacuated from the island and back to Japan.Frank, Guadalcanal: The Definitive Account of the Landmark Battle Japanese Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi (center) with friends in an undated photograph Kawaguchi was relegated to the reserve list in 1943. After recovering from a long illness, he was placed in command of the defenses of Tsushima Island in March 1945. After the war, Kawaguchi was arrested by the SCAP occupation authorities, and was tried and convicted of war crimes, including complicity in the execution of Philippines Supreme Court Chief Justice Jos√© Abad Santos. He was imprisoned at Sugamo Prison from 1946 until 1953, which was rather ironic, given his strong opposition to the atrocities ordered by Colonel Masanobu Tsuji. Kawaguchi died in Japan in 1961.

It was built by the Dharma Raja Karthika Thirunal (d.A D 1764), King of Travancore with the request, support and permission of the Kingdom of Kochi. Background The Nedumkotta was a defence fortification constructed along the northern borders of the erstwhile Travancore allied Cochin State.of 1757-1762AD.The places north of Nedumkotta was under Zamorin occupied Cochin.(1757-1762)It passed through the territories of the then Cochin State. The Nedumkotta was built primarily to resist the invasion under Hyder Ali Khan against Travancore State and southern parts Cochin state.. It was raised mainly with clay and mud, and reinforced with stones, laterite and granite at strategic places. It started from the KrishanKotta on the west coast, above Kodungallur, and stretched up to the Anamala Hills on the Western Ghats. It was about 48 km long, 20 feet wide and 12 feet high. Its alignment was along the Periyar river on the west coast up to Chalakudy from where it went along the Chalakudy river up to the Annamalai Hills in the east. There were underground cells to store gunpowder and other war materials, special chambers for soldiers to live, and look-outs and mounted field-guns all along the fortification. Besides, on the north side of the fortification, ditches were dug twenty feet wide and sixteen feet deep, and filled with thorny plants, poisonous snakes, and hidden weapons. On the south side as well as on the top of the fortification, wide roads were laid for the convenience of military movements. The structure The fortification was constructed during the regime of Rama Varma Raja, popularly known as Dharma Raja of Travancore, and under the direct guidance and supervision of the then Prime Minister, Ayyappan Marthanda Pillai, and the then Commander of the Travancore Army, the Dutch Captain D'Lenoy. This historic defence line was comparable to the Great Wall of China except that the latter was more ancient and greater in length. It was under the protective cover of this Nedumkotta that a small army of Travancoreans under the command of Raja Keshavadas defeated and frustrated near Alwaye a formidable army led by Tipu Sultan. Today there is no physical evidence of the historic Nedumkotta in the form of even ruins anywhere in the Chalakudy taluk -Konoor (Koratty Kizhakkummuri), Muringoor Thekkummury, Kadukutty,Kuruvilassery,Pallipuram and Poyya- through which it passed. Names of forts remains in Chettuva, Mullurkara,Thrissur and Enamanakhal. However, some place names having a reference to the historic fortification are still popular in the northern borders of the erstwhile Cochin and Travancore States - Krishnan Kotta (meaning Krishnan Fort), Kottamukku (fort corner), Kottamuri (part of a fort), Kottaparampu (fort land), Kotta Vazhi (fort road), Kottalaparampu (magazine ground), Palayam (cantonment), etc. It started from Pallipuram Kotta near the sea, touches kottamukku, krishnankotta and extended till the Foot hills of the Anamalai in the Western Ghats. The Chalakudy river and lagoon which falls on the alignment was left alone as they themselves were a barrier. A trench deep and wide was built along the northern side of the wall for the full length. At some places the wall reached in height. Hollows were made inside where about 100 soldiers could hide and make an ambush. A company of soldiers was stationed about every kilometer with ammunition store house at strategic points. There were also caves in the nearby wells to hide in the possibility of an unannounced attack. Muringoor Kottamury (3 km south of Chalakudy) is the place where the NH47 crosses the Nedumkotta. The places where fortification once stood is in the present Chalakudy Taluk in Thrissur District, Kerala. Attack of Tipu Sultan and its destruction 24 years after his father, Hyder Ali had attacked Kochi, Tipu Sultan started on a conquest to conquer Kochi and Travancore. On 31 December 1789 Tipu attacked the lines and gained entry but was ambushed by a small 20-member team led by Vaikom Padmanabha Pillai of Travancore army and had to retreat. Later in April he came back with reinforcements and this time was able to break into the territory after making the way through the Nedumkotta. He destroyed the wall at Konoor kotaa or kottamuri and advanced further. He filled trenches for a few kilometers to enable his army to move forward. He finally reached the Periyar river banks at Aluva and camped there. However, by this time a small group led by Vaikom Padmanabha Pillai and Kunjai Kutty Pillai went upstream and managed to break the walls of a dam at Bhoothathankettu causing heavy flash floods downstream Periyar river.Malayalam Historical Novel \\"Rama Raja Bahudur\\" authored by C. V. Raman Pillai All the ammunition and gunpowder of Tipu's army got wet and became inactive. He was thus forced to return. Information that the British army was planning an attack on Srirangapatnam hastened his retreat. Many portions of the wall were destroyed during war, others later eroded away due to heavy rains, and trenches were filled up. The most of the ruins whatever left have also been lost due ignorance about the historical structure among the locals.Valath,V.V.K mentions in a local Daily, Mathrubhumi on 1978 July 6 about a cave being found when a village road was being excavated near krishnankotta and subsequently being destroyed. This he mentions was part of the structure. Unfortunately, there are no memorials erected anywhere in Parur, or Angamaly or Alwaye to honour the Dharma Raja, D'Lennoy and Ayyappan Marthanda Pillai who were the architects of the fort; or Raja Keshavadas under whose direct command a comparatively small army humbled and defeated the invading army of Tipu Sultan.

It also shares the common name horse clam with Tresus nuttallii a species which is similar in morphology and lifestyle. Both species are somewhat similar to the geoduck (Panopea generosa, which is in the family Hiatellidae), though smaller, with shells up to eight inches long (20 cm), weight to 3-4 lb (1.4-1.8 kg). The two species commonly known as horse clams inhabit the Pacific coast intertidal zones: the pacific gaper, T. nuttallii, more abundant south to California; and the fat gaper, T. capax, more abundant north to Alaska. Both have oval and chalky-white or yellow shells with patches of brown periostracum (leather-like skin) on the shell. These clams are also commonly called gapers because their shells are flared around the siphon and do not completely close, rather like geoduck clams. Like geoducks, they are unable to completely retract the siphon within the shell, though less flagrantly as the siphon on Tresus species is not as large.  Identification  An easy way to tell the two species apart is that T. nuttallii usually has relatively longer, narrower shells (longer compared to height) and larger siphonal plates (horny plates found at the tip of the siphon, often with a little algae or barnacles garden). Hence T. capax is the fat gaper.  Habitat and lifestyle  Their habitat is the lower intertidal zones on out to waters as deep as 50-60 feet (13‚Äì15 m). They prefer sand, mud, and gravel substrates, normally burying themselves 12-16 inches (30-41 cm), so they are much easier to dig than geoducks. Their preferred substrates are also preferred by butter and littleneck clams, so horse clams are often taken incidentally in commercial harvesting. Horse clams often have a relationship with small commensal pea crabs, Pinnixa faba, often a mating pair, which enter through the large siphon and live within the mantle cavity of the horse clam.Beach watchersG.E. MacGinite & N. MacGinite, Natural History of Marine Animals (Second Edition), McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1968, at p. 313. The crabs are easily seen and in no way affect the clam as food. The meat is good and makes excellent chowder. They tend to be ignored by sport diggers in Washington but not in Oregon. Horse clams are broadcast spawners like geoducks; T. nuttalii spawns in summer and T. capax in winter.(1) (2) Nash  Harvesting for food  Appreciated by pre-contact local Native Americans for their size, abundance, and relatively easy capture, they are less sought today than geoducks, which have gained a marketing cachet. Identification is important. Best recipes vary with species. For resource sustainability, the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife sets size and bag limits for these clams. The Department of Health sometimes closes beaches for public health and safety. The Department of Health Marine Biotoxin web site has current information. King County has a well-illustrated clam identification procedure .Brenner Some clammers find horse clams are not as tasty as others, so it's not unusual during clamming season to find horse clams left behind on the beach. The shells are more fragile than they might appear, so it is critical that they not be damaged when first digging if they are not kept. The clams will soon die if abandoned. The adults are unable to rebury themselves--they need the pressure of their surroundings to remain intact and maneuver. They can't hold their two big valves together, protecting their soft tissues. Responsible diggers carefully rebury them to about the depth at which the clams were found.  Prehistorical exploitation  Early exploitation of horse clams is known by Native Americans on the Pacific Ocean coast of California. For example, archaeological recovery from Chumash sites in San Luis Obispo County has revealed use of horse clam shells as a scoop implement. An unusually well decorated specimen was found at the present day town of Morro Bay during archaeological excavation.C.M.Hogan, 2008  Notes and references  Bibliography   C.

History In 1929, professor Vladimir Shamov of Kharkiv, USSR, reported the experimental use of cadaveric blood and demonstrated the absence of toxicity. Russian surgeon Sergei Yudin pioneered the transfusion of cadaveric blood and performed this successfully for the first time on March 23, 1930. Yudin also reported his first seven clinical transfusions with cadaveric blood at the Fourth Congress of Ukrainian Surgeons at Kharkiv in September 1930. With the discovery that cadaveric blood could be stored safely, time was provided for both serological tests and bacteriological examinations. Cadaveric blood was apparently never used widely, even in Russia. From these studies, however have developed a variety of means and methods for the collection, preservation, and storage of blood for transfusion, all of which may be grouped under the generic term of ‚Äúblood bank\\". Although cadaver blood transfusion did not catch on in the United States, Dr. Bernard Fantus modified the Soviet idea by preserving blood from healthy living persons. Drawing on earlier work involving preservatives and anticoagulants, Fantus added the element of refrigeration and in 1937 established the first blood bank in the United States at Chicago's Cook County Hospital.

The Journal of the Burma Research Society (JBRS) was the first academic journal devoted to Burma Studies. The journal started in 1911 about the same time as The Journal of the Siam Society and was published in Burma but is no longer published today. The Myanmar Historical Commission which was established in 1955 regularly publishes a journal and holds conferences in Burma Currently, outside of Burma (Myanmar) there are two academic journals specialising in Burma Studies research articles, the Journal of Burma Studies and the SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research. The Center for Burma Studies at Northern Illinois University is the national center for Burma studies in the United States and one of the only centers of its kind in the world, collecting Burmese art artifacts and hosting an archive or other Burmese materials. Its current director is Dr. Catherine Raymond, Associate Professor of Art History at Northern Illinois University. The center publishes the Journal of Burma Studies, a joint publication made in collaboration with the Burma Studies Foundation and the Burma Studies Group of the Association for Asian Studies. It is the essential, and only, peer- reviewed academic journal regarding Burma studies. There is also a lot of activity in Burma studies at the University of Michigan, Cornell University, L'Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales, the University of Hawaii, the National University of Singapore, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Rutgers University, as well as in Universities and Institutes in Burma (Myanmar), such as Yangon University, Mandalay University, and the Historical Research Centre. The Burma Studies Group of the Association for Asian Studies maintains the Burma studies e-list, created in March 2013 for the purpose of facilitating communication within the community of international scholars active in Burma/Myanmar-related studies. The School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London was the first institution of higher education outside of Burma to have many faculty specialising in Burma Studies. Specialists in the Burmese language and literature included the scholars Hla Pe, John Okell, Anna Allot and in the history of Burma the historian D.G.E. Hall. Harry Leonard Shorto specialised in Mon language and literature. The late historian of Burma U Than Tun received his doctorate in history at SOAS. Many current specialists in Burma and its languages and ethnic groups received their doctorates at SOAS such as the historians Victor B. Lieberman and the Mon linguist Christian Bauer. Despite the name of the country having been changed to \\"Myanmar\\" by the military junta, most universities outside of Burma (Myanmar) still refer to this academic focus as \\"Burma studies\\" reflecting the contested status of the name \\"Myanmar\\" outside of the country.

He first appeared on-screen during the soap's first episode broadcast 16 October 1972 and remained in the programme until 1983. After a brief return in the following year, Hines reprised his role on a permanent basis in 1986, a landmark year for the show under Richard Handford. He made his last appearance in August 1994, and subsequently died off-screen the following year. In 2019, Hines confirmed that he would like to return to the soap despite his off-screen death. Development Joe is a farmer as was his father. When Emmerdale began it depicted actual farm life. Rather than act out tasks Hines learned to dip sheep and milk cows. Joe is involved in a relationship with Christine Sharp (Angela Cheyne). They married during the episode broadcast 10 September 1974.Hayward 1997, p.131. The duo overcome a series of problems before marrying and Christine has the wedding day \\"she'd always dreamed of\\". To commemorate the event TVTimes featured a promotional souvenir photograph for readers prior to the episode's airdate. Storylines Joe is the youngest child of Jacob and Annie Sugden (Sheila Mercier). Although it is claimed that he was born on 31 May 1949, Joe tells Henry Wilks in an episode broadcast in 1973 that he is \\"almost 21\\", which would make the year of his birth to be at least 1952. Jacob dies in October 1972 and Joe's brother, Jack, inherits the farm and divides it between the family. After a failed attempt at courting Marian Wilks (Gail Harrison), Joe starts dating Christine Sharp and they soon marry but separate when Christine decides she does not want to be a farmer's wife. Christine returns the following year to reconcile but Joe wants a divorce and she leaves for good. Joe's next relationship is with Kathy Gimbel (Polly Hemingway), who moves in with him. Their relationship is a huge talking point in the village as Kathy is separated from her husband, Kenny. When Kathy's father, Jim (John Atkinson) shoots himself, Kathy leaves Joe to live with her mother, Freda (Mary Henry). In 1980, Joe gets a job working for NY estates and gets jobs for his nephew Jackie Merrick (Ian Sharrock) and Jackie's half-sister Sandie (Jane Hutcheson). Joe develops feelings for vicar's daughter, Barbara Peters (Rosie Kerslake) in 1983 but is rejected and moves to France for several years but briefly returns for the funeral of his grandfather, Sam Pearson (Toke Townley), in November 1984. In 1986, Joe returns permanently and becomes regional manager for NY Estates. During this time, he has a brief relationship with Karen Moore (Annie Hulley) who had previously had an affair with Jack but Karen ends the relationship. In 1988, Joe meets divorcee Kate Hughes (Sally Knyvette), and her two teenage children, Rachel (Glenda McKay) and Mark Hughes (Craig McKay). Initially Kate and Joe argue after he shoots her dog for bothering his sheep but eventually they fall in love. They marry in 1989 after Joe proposes but with Mark and Rachel opposed and wanting Kate to reconcile with their father, David) (Martyn Whitby), Joe becomes worried. They do marry and Kate's children eventually come round to their mother's new marriage.

On 30 December 1993, Joe and Mark argue over a vacuum cleaner that needs returning so Mark goes to the Whiteley Farm when a large section of an Eastern European Airjet comes down, knocking down a wall which falls on Mark, killing him. Joe, his mother, Annie and her new husband Leonard Kempinski (Bernard Archard) are also hit when another part of the plane hits his car. Joe breaks a leg, Annie is left comatose but Leonard is killed. When Joe learns of Mark's death, he becomes very depressed and blames himself.

He served as the 26th Archbishop of Manila in the Philippines from 1903 to 1916 before returning to the United States, where he served as Archbishop (personal title) of Omaha from 1916 to 1927. Biography Jeremiah Harty was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Andrew and Julia (n√©e Murphy) Harty, who were Irish immigrants. He was educated by the Christian Brothers in grade school and by the Jesuits in high school. He attended St. Louis University, from where he graduated in 1872. He studied theology at St. Vincent's College in Cape Girardeau. Harty was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Patrick Ryan on April 28, 1878. His first assignment was as assistant pastor of St. Lawrence O'Toole Church in St. Louis. He then served at St. Bridget Church, where he remained until he became founding pastor of St. Leo Church in 1888. On June 6, 1903, Harty was appointed Archbishop of Manila in the Philippines by Pope Leo XIII. He was the first American to be named to that position. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 15 from Cardinal Francesco Satolli, with Archbishops Diomede Panici and Amilcare Tonietti serving as co-consecrators, in Rome. After his term in Manila he was appointed as the Bishop of Omaha, in Nebraska. During his term, Archbishop Harty was increasingly troubled by the propagation of the Protestant faith in the Philippines, which was being introduced by the Thomasites, and which was gaining a foothold among Filipinos because of the strong anti-friar sentiments that existed at that time. Due to the lack of Catholic educational institutions in the country, Archbishop Harty, himself an alumnus of a Christian Brother school in St. Louis, Missouri, would appeal to the Superior-General of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in 1905 for the establishment of a De La Salle school in the Philippines. While the pressing need for a De La Salle school in the Islands was recognized, Harty's request was denied because of the Christian Brothers' lack of funds. Nonetheless, Harty continued to appeal for the establishment of additional Catholic schools in the country to Pope Pius X including, among others, St. Theresa's College Manila. On March 10, 1911, upon instructions from the Vatican to the La Salle Generalate, Brothers Blimond Pierre, Aloysius Gonzaga, and Augusto Correge arrived in the Philippines from Europe and established De La Salle College in Paco, the first Christian Brother school in the country. On May 16, 1916, after 13 years in the Philippines, Harty was appointed Bishop of Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska filling the vacancy caused by the death of Richard Scannell, who died on January 8, 1916. Harty was succeeded in Manila by Michael J. O'Doherty. In 1917, Bishop Harty was skeptical of Father Edward J. Flanagan and Boys Town, but would later endorse the goals of Boys Town. Minor Watson portrayed (Harty) the Bishop of Omaha in the 1938 motion picture Boys Town. Death On October 29, 1927, Harty died as Bishop of Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska, at the age of 74. He was a priest for 50 years, 24 years as a bishop. References # De La Salle University-Manila. Student's Handbook: 2003-06.

Written by Mick Jagger and Richards, \\"Live with Me\\" was recorded on 24 May 1969. As Taylor joined the band weeks later, his guitar part was dubbed over the basic track. Along with \\"Country Honk\\", this was one of the two songs on Let it Bleed that guitarist Mick Taylor played on. He and Keith Richards created an original 2-lead guitar sound. The song's lyrics were cited as the reason why the London Bach Choir asked not to be credited for their contribution to \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\". The poet X. J. Kennedy suggested that the lyrics are part of a tradition of responses, beginning with John Donne and Sir Walter Raleigh and continuing through C. Day-Lewis, to Christopher Marlowe's \\"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\\". Marlowe's poem begins \\"Come live with me and be my love\\". Although never released as a single, the song has been frequently performed live, and concert versions appear on the albums Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, No Security, and Light the Fuse, as well as the 1996 \\"Wild Horses\\" (live) single and the Rarities 1971‚Äì2003 compilation album.

It is authored by Hajime Yatate (original creator), Tatsuhito Higuchi (scenario), Hiroyuki Yoshino (scenario) and Kenetsu Sat≈ç (art). During its 44-chapter run, it was published in Akita Shoten's Sh≈çnen Champion, with its first publication in August 2005,Ëàû‚Äê‰πôHiME ZweiÔΩû„Ç¨„É´„Éá„É≠„Éº„ÉôOfficialWebÔΩû „É¶„É°„Éé‚òÜ„ÉÑ„ÉÖ„Ç≠:. Last accessed April 9, 2007. two months prior to the release of the anime. It is a semi-fusion of the Mai-Hime anime and manga (e.g. Haruka's element and Shizuru's knowledge of her own naginata- wielding 'dark twin' as well as Alyssa's sisterly relationship with Natsuki Kruger and the apparent romantic relationship between Viola and the latter). In addition, there is a derivative chapter called Mai Otome Super H, centred on an onsen visit. It was published in the Champion RED magazine. As the title suggests, it has hentai content, although it is a canonical work by the original manga artist and the content is not as explicit as most H-Doujinshi. It takes place between chapter 12 and 13, but no mention is made of it in the main plot. It is unconnected to the new My-Otome Zwei manga, which follows the anime's plot more closely. A continuation of the original manga was released called My-Otome Arashi Ëàû-HiME „Éì„ÉÉ„Ç∞„Éê„É≥‚òÖ„Éó„É≠„Ç∏„Çß„ÇØ„ÉàÂßãÂãï!! which introduces Archduke Nagi's younger twin sister (disguised as a man) Arashi who has purchased Garderobe and all of its students after the campus incurred repair debts from the end of the original manga during Sergay's coup turning the school into a nightclub despite the fact that Garderobe is the single most vital element to all the nations of Earl by supplying Otomes (they have supposedly been abandoned by the world). Story One night in the Windbloom Kingdom, Princess Mashiro Blan de Windbloom is assassinated in her sleep. Some days later, the main character, an anonymous boy, arrives in Wind City, capital of Windbloom. Using a gem passed down from his mother, he takes up the identity of Mashiro and joins Garderobe. The story follows his experiences in Garderobe and later his battles against those who would seek to destabilise the peace.

As with Hime in My-HiME otome is a pun as in Japanese it can mean maiden or virgin which is appropriate since all Otome need to be virgins to retain their powers, as the nanomachines are destroyed upon contact with a chemical found in sperm.My-Otome manga; Chapter 3, page 13 * GEM - Generable (sic) Enigmatic Matrix,My-Otome manga; Chapter 1, page 13 as explained in Chapters 1 and 2.My-Otome manga; Chapter 2, page 2 The source of an Otome's power. * Element - The weapon of an Otome, examples include Shizuru's whip like katana and Arika's blue crystal lance. * SLAVE - A creature summoned by a contract using one's own blood. The lifeforce of a SLAVE is connected to that of the summoner, meaning if the slave is killed the owner perishes along with it much like the Key and Child bond in My-HiME. * REM - Reinforceing (sic) Enigmatic Matrix.My-Otome manga; Chapter 18, page 10 A Schwarz-modified version of Garderobe's GEM. Used by Midori. It appears to allow the user access to their own Robe, as opposed to invisibly enhancing the user like the anime's does, although since Midori's is the only one seen, no generalisation of its abilities can be made. Midori's REM allows her to draw on the power of her minions. Unlike the anime, Yohko does not eventually upgrade it to have infinite duration. Compatible with Garderobe's nanomachines, allowing Arika to briefly Materialise by using it in Chapters 36 and 37. * MAID - Multi-purpose Assistant-type Independent Droid. A series of robots based on Miyu that are being developed in Aries. They are \\"perfect and flawless\\".My-Otome manga; Chapter 15, page 1 No anime equivalent exists. * Beautiful Power (Miryoku) - A form of energy that powers special attacks by the Otome. Some otome have special charge-up attacks such as Arika's 'Bolt from the Blue', Nao's 'Bloody Stripe Circus', and Natsuki's 'Howling Silver Wolf' but are much different from Miryoku. The special attacks an Otome use that are powered by this are unique to each and usually one Otome only has one, but more powerful Otomes like Arika and Nina have multiple. * Butou - Formal ceremonial battles between Otome. Students may also engage in them. All of these special battles must be approved first, as they are subject to strict rules and procedures.

Summary According to Gould, classical Darwinism encompasses three essential core commitments: Agency, the unit of selection (which for Charles Darwin was the organism) upon which natural selection acts;Author Anonymous. The grand view The Economist December 5, 2002. efficacy, which encompasses the dominance of natural selection over all other forces‚Äîsuch as sexual selection, genetic drift, and biological constraints‚Äîin shaping the historical, ecological, and structural influences on evolution; and scope, the degree to which natural selection can be extrapolated to explain biodiversity at the macroevolutionary level, including the evolution of higher taxonomic groups. Gould described these three propositions as the \\"tripod\\" of Darwinian central logic, each being so essential to the structure that if any branch were cut it would either kill, revise, or superficially refurbish the whole structure‚Äîdepending on the severity of the cut. According to Gould \\"substantial changes, introduced during the last half of the 20th century, have built a structure so expanded beyond the original Darwinian core, and so enlarged by new principles of macroevolutionary explanation, that the full exposition, while remaining within the domain of Darwinian logic, must be construed as basically different from the canonical theory of natural selection, rather than simply extended.\\" In the arena of agency, Gould explores the concept of \\"hierarchy\\" in the action of evolution (the idea that evolution may act on more than one unit simultaneously, as opposed to only acting upon individual organisms). In the arena of efficacy he explores the forces beside natural selection that have been considered in evolutionary theory. In the arena of scope he considers the relevance of natural selection to the larger scale patterns of life. Gould was motivated to write the book by contrasting the opinions of Darwin and Hugh Falconer about the future of Darwinism.Hull, David L. (2002) A career in the glare of public acclaim Bioscience 52 (September): 837-841. Part I of the book focuses on the early history of evolutionary thought (pre-1859). Chapter one introduces and outlines the Structure of Evolutionary Theory, with chapter two covering the structure of The Origin of Species, chapter three focusing on issues surrounding agency, chapters four and five covering efficacy, and chapters six and seven covering scope. Part II‚Äîcomprising the bulk of the text‚Äîfocuses on the modern discussion and debate (post-1959). Chapters eight and nine cover agency, while chapters ten and eleven cover efficacy, and twelve covers scope. Sections of the book dealing with punctuated equilibrium, primarily chapter nine, have been posthumously reprinted as a separate volume by Belknap Harvard.

The Pilgrims' Way runs close to the village on the Downs and was travelled by pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. The M20 motorway and High Speed 1 pass through the long south- west outskirts of the parish. History Westwell is a rural village in the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty at the foot of the Westwell Downs, the highest part of which is called the Beacon after the chain of beacons erected to signal the approach of the Spanish Armada. The village was first mentioned in 858 in a Saxon document and was included in the Domesday Book. A weekly market was held here under a licence granted by Edward I, there was a park during Edward II's time and later a vineyard tended by monks (recalled by one of the cottages in the village named Vineyards). The centre of the village is a conservation area with many mature trees and listed buildings, including Court Lodge, Swinford Cottage, Periton Court and The Mill House. The notable parish church is St. Mary the Virgin which dates from the 13th century or earlier. Among many other buildings of interest in the parish are Ripple Court (which used to house the local dungeons‚Äîand where it is alleged that Jack Cade was captured) and The Haven (pronounced 'harven') a Tudor residence where Elizabeth I is believed to have spent one night.Ashford Borough Council The village was formerly served by Hothfield for Westwell railway station on the Maidstone Line.

Like for their new prime time counterpart shows, television networks in the United States and Canada would film a preview special for the fall season. These would often air as part of the regular network schedule, or be made available to their affiliates for airing at any time, especially to fill timeslots which contained programming canceled months before. Overview=Typical air times The Saturday morning previews were generally aired on the network in prime-time, usually the Friday night before the new schedule began. Specials were staggered between differing time slots and days in order to allow each network's show to stand out. Format The preview specials are usually hosted by stars of one or more of the network's popular series and feature an array of special guests, with the continuity between each program preview being fictionalized with a small plot or theme to keep viewers interested. The previews were for new and returning series, with each preview featuring the show's opening credits and a scene from that program. They also unveiled a network's new imaging for Saturday morning programming. Decline With the changes in direction for Saturday morning, in light of FCC rules requiring programming to be educational or informational and concentration of media ownership, especially with CBS's Viacom ownership until 2005 and ABC's Disney ownership, which caused those companies to market their all-children's networks (Nickelodeon and Disney Channel, respectively) much more than their broadcast counterparts, causing purposeful viewership declines. The exodus of this programming to cable, along with the outsourcing of children's blocks to other parties, meant the preview specials on the legacy \\"Big 3\\" networks all but disappeared by the start of the new millennium, with Fox being the last network to still feature annual specials (even though Fox's Saturday morning block was programmed by 4Kids TV, which aired on other stations in larger markets in syndication arrangements, meaning that those specials advertised programming that did not actually air on those Fox stations). Fox, incidentally, abandoned all children's programming in favor of the Weekend Marketplace infomercial block in December 2008; the block was eventually leased in fall 2014 to an outside E/I programmer.

Mesoamerican scripts deciphered to date are a combination of logographic and syllabic systems. They are often called hieroglyphs due to the iconic shapes of many of the glyphs, a pattern superficially similar to Egyptian hieroglyphs. Fifteen distinct writing systems have been identified in pre- Columbian Mesoamerica, many from a single inscription. The limits of archaeological dating methods make it difficult to establish which was the earliest and hence the forebear from which the others developed. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and the most widely known, is the classic Maya script. An extensive Mesoamerican literature has been conserved, partly in indigenous scripts and partly in postconquest transcriptions in the Latin script.  Pre-Classic and Classic Period  In Mesoamerica, writing emerged during the Pre-classic Period, with Zapotec and Maya writing flourishing during the Classic Period. The 62 glyphs of the Cascajal block  Olmec writing  Early Olmec ceramics show representations of something that may be codices, suggesting that amatl bark codices, and by extension well-developed writing, existed in Olmec times. It was also long thought that many of the glyphs present on Olmec monumental sculpture, such as those on the so-called \\"Ambassador Monument\\" (La Venta Monument 13), represented an early Olmec script. This suspicion was reinforced in 2002 by the announcement of the discovery of similar glyphs at San Andres.https://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5600/1984/tab-figures-data In September 2006, a report published in Science magazine announced the discovery of the Cascajal block, a writing-tablet-sized block of serpentine with 62 characters unlike any yet seen in Mesoamerica. This block was discovered by locals in the Olmec heartland and was dated by the archaeologists to approximately 900 BCE based on other debris. If the authenticity and date can be verified, this will prove to be the earliest writing yet found in Mesoamerica. Monument 3 at San Jose Mogote. The two shaded glyphs between his legs are likely his name, Earthquake 1.  Zapotec writing  Another candidate for earliest writing system in Mesoamerica is the writing system of the Zapotec culture. Rising in the late Pre-Classic era after the decline of the Olmec civilization, the Zapotecs of present-day Oaxaca built an empire around Monte Alban. On a few monuments at this archaeological site, archaeologists have found extended text in a glyphic script. Some signs can be recognized as calendric information but the script as such remains undeciphered. Read in columns from top to bottom, its execution is somewhat cruder than that of the later Classic Maya and this has led epigraphers to believe that the script was also less phonetic than the largely syllabic Maya script. These are, however, speculations. The earliest known monument with Zapotec writing is a \\"Danzante\\" stone, officially known as Monument 3, found in San Jose Mogote, Oaxaca. It has a relief of what appears to be a dead and bloodied captive with two glyphic signs between his legs, probably representing his name. First dated to 500‚Äì600 BCE, this was earlier considered the earliest writing in Mesoamerica. However doubts have been expressed as to this dating and the monument may have been reused. The Zapotec script went out of use only in the late Classic period. Detail showing glyphs from 2nd century CE La Mojarra Stela 1. The left column gives a Long Count date of 8.5.16.9.9, or 162 CE. The other columns are glyphs from the Epi-Olmec script.  Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script  A small number of artifacts found in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec show examples of another early Mesoamerican writing system. They can be seen to contain calendric information but are otherwise undeciphered. The longest of these texts are on La Mojarra Stela 1 and the Tuxtla Statuette. The writing system used is very close to the Maya script, using affixal glyphs and Long Count dates, but is read only in one column at a time as is the Zapotec script. It has been suggested that this Isthmian or Epi-Olmec script is the direct predecessor of the Maya script, thus giving the Maya script a non-Maya origin. Another artifact with Epi-Olmec script is the Chiapa de Corzo stela which is the oldest monument of the Americas inscribed with its own date: the Long Count on the stela dates it to 36 BCE. In a 1997 paper, John Justeson and Terrence Kaufman put forward a decipherment of Epi-Olmec. The following year, however, their interpretation was disputed by Stephen Houston and Michael D. Coe, who unsuccessfully applied Justeson and Kaufman's decipherment system against epi-Olmec script from the back of a hitherto unknown mask. The matter remains under dispute. Stela 5 from Abaj Takalik  Abaj Takalik and Kaminaljuy√∫ scripts  In the highland Maya archaeological sites of Abaj Takalik and Kaminaljuy√∫ writing has been found dating to Izapa culture. It is likely that in this area in late Pre- Classic times an ancient form of a Mixe‚ÄìZoquean language was spoken, and the inscriptions found here may be in such a language rather than a Maya one. Some glyphs in this scripts are readable as they are identical to Maya glyphs but the script remains undeciphered. The advanced decay and destruction of these archaeological sites make it improbable that more monuments with these scripts will come to light making possible a decipherment. Maya glyphs in stucco at the Museo de sitio in alt=  Maya writing  Maya writing is attested from the mid-preclassic period in the center of Pet√©n in the Maya lowlands, and lately scholars have suggested that the earliest Maya inscriptions may in fact be the oldest of Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 200‚Äì300 BCE. Early examples include the painted inscriptions at the caves of Naj Tunich and La Cobanerita in El Pet√©n, Guatemala. The most elaborate inscriptions are considered to be those at classic sites like Palenque, Cop√°n and Tikal. The Maya script is generally considered to be the most fully developed Mesoamerican writing system, mostly because of its extraordinary aesthetics and because it has been partially deciphered. In Maya writing, logograms and syllable signs are combined. Around 700 different glyphs have been documented, with some 75% having been deciphered. Around 7000 texts in Maya script have been documented. Maya writing first developed as only utilizing logograms, but later included the use of phonetic complements in order to differentiate between the semantic meanings of the logograms and for context that allows for syllabic spelling of words. Post-classic inscriptions are found at the Yucat√°n peninsula in sites such as Chich√©n Itza and Uxmal but the style is not nearly as accomplished as the classic Maya inscriptions.  Other potential Mesoamerican writing systems  Two other potential writing systems of the pre-classic period have been found in Mesoamerica: The Tlatilco cylinder seal was found during the time frame of the Olmec occupation of Tlatilco, and appears to contain a non- pictographic script. The Chiapa de Corzo cylinder seal found at that location in Mexico also appears to be an example of an unknown Mesoamerican script. Certain iconographic elements in Teotihuacano art have been considered as a potential script,Taube, Karl A. (2000), The Writing System of Ancient Teotihuacan. Center for Ancient American Studies, Barnardsville, NC. although it is attested sparsely and in individual glyphs rather than texts. If it indeed is a writing system, it is \\"one whose usage is non-textual and only restricted to naming people and places\\". In this aspect, it resembles later Central Mexican writing systems such as Mixtec and Aztec.  Post-Classic Period  During the post-classic period, the Maya glyphic system continued to be used, but much less so. Other post-classic cultures such as the Aztec did not have fully developed writing systems, but instead used semasiographic writing.  Mixtec writing  alt= The Mixtec writing emerged during the 13th century, much later than the systems previously mentioned. Mixtec is a semasiographic system that was used by the pre-Hispanic Mixtecs. Many of its characteristics were later adopted by the Mexica and Mixteca-Puebla writing systems. The origin of the Mixteca-Puebla is the subject of debate amongst experts. The Mixtec writing system consisted of a set of figurative signs and symbols that served as guides for storytellers as they recounted legends. These storytellers were usually priests and other members of the Mixtec upper class. Mixtec writing has been categorized as being a mixture of pictorial and logographic, rather than a complete logogram system. Mixtec writing has been preserved through various archaeological artifacts that have survived the passage of time and the destruction of the Spanish conquest. Among these objects are four pre-Hispanic codices written on tanned deer skin covered with stucco. These codices are read in boustrophedon, a zigzag style in which the reader follows red lines that indicate the way to read. Most of the current knowledge about the writing of the Mixtecans is due to the work of Alfonso Caso, who undertook the task of deciphering the code based on a set of pre- Columbian and colonial documents of the Mixtec culture. Although the Mixtecs had a set of symbols that allowed them to record historical dates, they did not use the long count calendar characteristic of other southeast Mesoamerican writing systems. Instead, the codices that have been preserved record historical events of this pre-Columbian people, especially those events related to expansionism in the era of Ocho Venado, lord of Tilantongo.  Aztec writing  left The Aztec writing system is adopted from writing systems used in Central Mexico. It is related to Mixtec writing and both are thought to descend from Zapotec writing. The Aztecs used semasiographic writing, although they have been said to be slowly developing phonetic principles in their writing by the use of the rebus principle. Aztec name glyphs for example, do combine logographic elements with phonetic readings.  Post-Columbian Period  When Europeans arrived in the 16th century, they found several writing systems in use that drew from Olmec, Zapotec, and Teotihuacano traditions.Robert T. Jim√©nez, & Patrick H. Smith. (2008). Mesoamerican Literacies: Indigenous Writing Systems and Contemporary Possibilities. Reading Research Quarterly, 43(1), 28. Books and other written material were commonplace in Mesoamerica when Hernan Cortes arrived in 1519. Archaeologists have found inside elite Mayan homes personal objects inscribed with the owners' names. In public areas large stone pillars and inscribed monuments have been found clearly meant for the general public.M.R. Romero. (2003).

Early post- Columbian sources preserve and document aspects of indigenous literature (e.g., Ximenez's manuscript of the Popol Vuh) and writing (Diego de Landa's Relaci√≥n de las cosas de Yucat√°n contained Maya calendar signs and a syllabary). As European Franciscan missionaries arrived they found that the Cholutecans used rebus principles as a way to translate information into Latin as a teaching aid for the Indians to learn Christian prayers.Mendieta, G.de (1971).

Later indigenous literature employed Latin script exclusively, e.g., the Books of Chilam Balam that date from the 17th c. onwards. Already by the mid-16th c., use of the Latin script for Mesoamerican languages seems to have been well established. For writing Maya, colonial manuscripts conventionally adopt a number of special characters and diacritics thought to have been invented by Francisco de la Parra around 1545.Joseph DeChicchis (2012), Current Trends in Mayan Literacy, In: John C. Maher, Jelisava Dobovsek-Sethna, and Cary Duval (eds.), Literacy for Dialogue in Multilingual Societies. Proceedings of Linguapax Asia Symposium 2011, Tokyo 2012, p. 71-82Francisco de la Parra [con Pedro de Betanzos]: Arte, pronunciaci√≥n y orthographia de ... cakchequel. ms. The original manuscript of the Popol Vuh is also dated to this period (but only indirectly, by its content). The first major work of Mayan literature known to be originally written in Latin script are the Annals of the Cakchiquels (since 1571). Since the mid 1990s, Maya intellectuals attended workshops organized by Linda Schele to learn about Maya writing, and with digital technologies, Maya writing may indeed face a resurrection. Most notably, this includes work on the representation of Maya glyphs in Unicode since 2016 (not yet concluded by 2020). The goal of encoding Maya hieroglyphs in Unicode is to facilitate the modern use of the script. For representing the degree of flexibility and variation of classical Maya, the expressiveness of Unicode is insufficient (e.g., wrt. the representation of infixes), so, for philological applications, different technologies are required.

The company was founded by Yvon Chouinard in 1973, and is based in Ventura, California.  History  alt= Yvon Chouinard, an accomplished rock climber, began selling hand forged mountain climbing gear in 1957 through his company Chouinard Equipment. He worked alone selling his gear until 1965 when he partnered with Tom Frost in order to improve his products and address the growing supply and demand issue he faced. In 1970, Chouinard obtained rugby shirts from Scotland that he wore while climbing because the collar kept the climbing sling from hurting his neck. Great Pacific Iron Works, Patagonia's first store, opened in 1973 in the former Hobson meat-packing plant at Santa Clara St, in Ventura, near Chouinard's blacksmith shop. In 1981, Patagonia and Chouinard Equipment were incorporated within Great Pacific Iron Works. In 1984, Chouinard changed the name of Great Pacific Iron Works to Lost Arrow Corporation. renovated 1895-built former warehouse until moving to a new location in 2017. Patagonia has expanded its product line to include apparel targeted towards other sports, such as surfing. In addition to clothing, they offer other products such as backpacks, sleeping bags, and camping food. Starting in April 2017, certain Patagonia merchandise that is in good condition can be returned for new merchandise credits. The used merchandise gets cleaned and repaired and sold on their \\"Worn Wear\\" website. Activism Patagonia considers itself an \\"activist company\\".Patagonia, \\"The Activist Company\\" In 2017, the company was recognized for its innovative family/maternity leave policies. Environmental Patagonia commits 1% of its total sales to environmental groups, through One Percent for the Planet, an organization of which Yvon Chouinard was a founding member. One Percent for the Planet encourages businesses to commit 1% of their annual net revenue to nonprofit charity organizations focused on conservation and sustainability. In 2016, Patagonia took this initiative to the next level and pledged to contribute 100% of sales from Black Friday to environmental organizations, totaling $10m. In 2012, Patagonia became a Certified B Corporation, making it a for profit company that meets ‚Äúrigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency‚Äù. The company was the first to be registered as a benefit corporation in the State of California, after the California Corporations Code were revised setting new specific requirements. Politics and land preservation In February 2017, Patagonia led a boycott of the Outdoor Retailer trade show, which traditionally took place in Salt Lake City, Utah, because of the Utah state legislature's introduction of legislation that would transfer federal lands to the state. Patagonia also opposed Utah Governor Gary Herbert request that the Trump administration revoke the recently designated Bears Ears National Monument in southern Utah. After several companies joined the Patagonia-led boycott, event organizer Emerald Expositions said it would not accept a proposal from Utah to continue hosting the Outdoor Retailer trade show and would instead move the event to another state. On December 6, 2017, Patagonia sued the United States Government and President Donald Trump for his proclamations of reducing the Bears Ears National Monument by 85% and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by almost 50%. Patagonia is suing over the interpretation of the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution in which the country vests Congress with the power to manage federal lands. The company's CEO, Rose Marcario, contends that when Congress passed the Antiquities Act of 1906, it did not give any president the power to reverse a prior president's monument designations.David Gelles. \\"Patagonia v. Trump\\". The New York Times, May 5, 2018. In June 2018, the company announced that it would donate the $10 million it received from President Trump's 2017 tax cuts to \\"groups committed to protecting air, land and water and finding solutions to the climate crisis.\\"  Facebook ad boycott  In July 2020, Patagonia suspended its advertising on Facebook and Facebook's photo-sharing app, Instagram, making it the latest company to enter a U.S. civil rights boycott movement. This was done as a part of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, which was launched by several U.S. civil rights organizations who said the social network was doing too little to curb hate speech on its sites.  Materials  Current logo Down In 2012, UK animal activist group Four Paws said that Patagonia used live-plucked down feathers and downs of force-fed geese. In a statement on their website, Patagonia denied use of live-plucking but said it had used down procured from the foie-gras industry. As of fall 2014, Patagonia said it was using 100% traceable down to ensure that birds were not force-fed or live-plucked and that down is not blended with down from unknown sources.  Wool  In February 2005, Patagonia's sourcing of wool from Australia was criticized by PETA over the practice of mulesing. Patagonia has since moved its sourcing of wool from Australia to South America and the cooperative Ovis 21. However, in August 2015 PETA released new video footage showing how sheep were treated cruelly in Ovis 21 farms. This led Patagonia to stop sourcing wool from Ovis 21. In June 2016, Patagonia released a set of new wool principles that guide the treatment of animals as well as land-use practices, and sustainability.

It was later re-released digitally for the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. No version of the game was localized. Set in modern-day Japan, S≈çkaigi follows a group of friends led by high school student Mizuho Mikanagi as they are chosen to save Japan from a supernatural catastrophe. Gameplay has each character navigating levels, fighting monsters and completing required tasks to advance the story. The game was developed as part of Square's initiative of forming small teams of young developers to create experimental titles for the PlayStation. Director and writer Nobuhiko Amakawa wanted to create a modern Japanese fantasy. Yuke's was allowed total creative freedom by Square, who financed the project with a generous budget which allowed for live music composed by Hiroki Kikuta and full voice acting. Character designs were created by Natsuki Sumeragi. The game met with low sales and mixed reviews in both Japan and the West.  Gameplay  Soukaigi is an action role-playing game set in a fantastical version of Japan in 1998. The game is divided between gameplay segments and cutscenes used to communicate the narrative. Players take on the role of five different characters as they fight against powerful monsters controlling regions of the land; the main objective in each level is to destroy crystals of concentrated Suiki (negative energy) and gather Ouki (positive energy), the latter acting as experience points to raise a character's statistics (stats). Players control each character in third- person, starting with a pre-determined character and later expanding the available roster. The camera locked behind the player, but can be rotated with the character to explore the environment. Each character has a different innate ability in addition to basic attacks, a jump, a mid-air dash and items which can briefly increase attack power or perform special magical attacks. Enemies in levels are monsters, which manifesting around crystallised Suiki and attack the player after appearing. Stages range from countryside locations to towns, which allows for platforming areas where players jump between rooftops. Some stages feature areas of water, which kill a character on contact. Areas end with a boss encounter. Before boss encounters and outside levels, players can use gathered Ouki to raise any character's stats; these include health, strength, attack power, and special abilities and upgrades to abilities such as jumping. These are gathered from destroyed crystals in each area. There are three crystal types to find; red, blue and yellow, which are progressively more difficult to destroy. Dying at any point ends the game, forcing players to restart the level.  Story  Soukaigi takes place in December 1998. An explosion on Mount Fuji, as well as in other areas of Japan, has killed 14 percent of the nation's population. The explosions have caused several fireballs to unite into a gigantic pillar of fire 150 kilometers in height and 10 kilometers in width. Stone pillars known as \\"Gallan\\" have also appeared throughout Japan, and ghostly demigods known as \\"Yorigami\\" have taken claim to the now ruined country. The day of the explosions, a high school student in Noborito named Mizuho Mikanagi, along with four of her friends, takes on the task of saving Japan. Development During the late 1990s, Square launched an initiative to foster talent within the company; small teams of younger developers would work with a smaller budget to create experimental titles for the PlayStation; one of these titles was Soukaigi. Soukaigi was developed by Yuke's, a company best known for their sports titles. According to different sources, Yuke's was approached by Square, who were impressed at the technical prowess demonstrated by their wrestling game Power Move Pro Wrestling; or Yuke's approached Square with an ambitious gaming project which required funding and a publisher. The game was produced by Square's Yusuke Hirata, and directed and written by Nobuhiko Amakawa of Yuke's. The story concept of a modern Japanese fantasy came to Amakawa after Square approached Yuke's. While games based on Japanese folklore had seen little success at the time, Square allowed Yuke's total creative freedom and Amaga decided to go ahead with the concept. The characters were designed by artist Natsuki Sumeragi. Enemy designs were handled by Takeshi Tanaka. The various level areas were based on the Japanese regions in which they were set, although they were made more fantastic due to the game's premise. Soukaigi included full voice acting, with several prominent Japanese actors portraying the main cast; when they saw the casting budget, Square told Yuke's that they need not be concerned with it. The game featured two and a half hours of real-time cutscenes integrated into gameplay. Music Soundtrack composer, arranger and producer Hiroki Kikuta pictured in 2011. The music of Soukaigi was composed by Hiroki Kikuta, who had previously scored Secret of Mana and Trials of Mana. Kikuta acted as composer, arranger and producer for the soundtrack. The musical production was handled entirely by Square. The expanded storage capacity of the PlayStation allowed Kikuta to include live orchestral music. Due to it not being developed by Square, the game's influences were very different, encouraging Kikuta to experiment. As with his work on the Mana games, Kikuta wanted to push the hardware capacities of the PlayStation's sound card when creating his score. The music budget was ¬•30 million. Kikuta composed the music with \\"different complex styles\\"; his cited examples were the fusion of in-house music with live orchestra, and combining fusion and folk music. His main inspiration when composing were East European bands such as V√§rttin√§. The track \\"Quake\\" used Buddhist chant-inspired lyrics written in Malayan and Thai. The singers performed the lyrics phonetically, creating an exotic feeling to magnify the world and story. Recording the music took around a month. Kikuta was able to reserve multiple studios for recording because of the high budget, with his aim being to transform the live performances through computers when transferring them into the game. Conversely, this high studio usage and its toll on the overall budget severely restricted the number of tracks he could create. Due to his unconventional scoring style, which involved difficult cord transitions, there were some conflicts with the performers. Once he explained his idea, they understood and were able to perform their parts. Kikuta has said that he has different challenges for each of his compositions between Secret of Mana and Soukaigi; with Soukaigi, it was the challenge of recording live with Japanese stage musicians. A remembered incident during recording that impressed Kikuta was when guitar soloist Tomohito Aoki arrived in the studio with a severe hangover on the day they were recording the track \\"Fire Wire\\". After sending his assistant for some bottled water which he drank, Aoki performed the piece without any mistakes. Around 80% of the soundtrack was recorded live. The ending theme \\"Lovely Strains\\" was performed by Kotomi Kyono, with lyrics by Yuki Kitayama. An official soundtrack album was released on June 11, 1998. It was published by DigiCube and distributed by the music division of Sony under the under the catalog number SSCX-10017. The album was around 50 minutes long, and included seventeen tracks. Tracks from the game were later released on the Square Vocal Collection (2001), Square Enix Battle Tracks Vol.2 Square 1996ÔΩû1998 (2010), and Final Fantasy Tribute ~Thanks~ (2012) arrange albums. Dave Valentine of Video Game Music Online gave the album a rating of four out of five stars; Valentine was almost entirely positive about each track and the extensive use of live orchestra. Chris Greening of RPGFan was similarly positive, ranking the album as a must-buy alongside the soundtracks of Xenogears and Parasite Eve due to its strong live elements and different tone from other Square games. Release Soukaigi was first announced at the 1997 Tokyo Game Show. At the time, it was described as Square's first third-person action title. At its announcement, the game was roughly 50% complete. The game's Japanese title translates into English as \\"Twin Dimensions\\". Soukaigi released on 28 May 1998. It has never seen an official Western release. The game was later reissued on the PlayStation Network on August 13, 2008 as one of a series of vintage titles from the PlayStation era. It was later released for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. During its year of release, Soukaigi sold over 132,000 units. It ranks as one of the 100 best-selling games for that year. Soukaigi received a manga adaptation, written by Ayuki Kirishima and released by Kadokawa Shoten in three tank≈çbon between May 1998 and January 1999 as part of the publisher's Asuka Comics line. A novelization of the same name was published by Kadokawa Shoten through their Asuka Novel line on 2 June 1998. The novel was written by Hatano Taka, with a cover illustration by Sumeragi. Hatano Taka collaborated closely with Amakawa to ensure the novelization did not stray too far from the original game's plot and themes. New story segments, such as an epilogue, were added to explain the more confusing aspects, but these ended up creating unwanted contradictions that had to be smoothed out between Hatano and Amakawa.  Reception  Japanese magazine Famitsu was generally positive about the story, characters and music. One reviewer felt that the graphics looked \\"rough\\" for the PlayStation title. Western magazine Gamer's Republic was fairly negative about the game, with the reviewer finding that it was only the boss battles and music that kept him playing. GameSpot reviewer James Mielke said the game \\" fails to live up to its expectations\\", praising the music and stable frame rate, but finding most other aspects either low-quality or poorly designed. He summarized that the game could not stand up against other similar 3D titles such as Panzer Dragoon Saga. In a separate feature titled \\"Games You'll Never Play\\", GameSpot called Soukaigi \\"A great idea but a cruddy game\\", citing a lack of polish and a greater scale than the PlayStation could handle. IGN, in a preview of a nearly-finished version of the game, were scathing about the gameplay, though gave praise to the environment and enemy designs. Japanese websites Inside Games and Dengeki Online both posted retrospectives for the game's 20th anniversary; they each praised the narrative, soundtrack and technical performance, but faulted the gameplay segments and overall graphical quality.

Groundwater saturates the soil except during brief seasonal dry spells and during prolonged droughts. Pocosin soils are nutrient-deficient (oligotrophic), especially in phosphorus.Snyder, S. A. (1993). Pocosin. In: Fire Effects Information System, (Online). Fire Sciences Laboratory, United States Forest Service. Retrieved 2011-02-16. Pocosins occur in the southern portions of the Atlantic coastal plain of North America, spanning from southeastern Virginia, through North Carolina, and into South Carolina. However, the majority of pocosins are found in North Carolina.Rapid Assessment Reference Condition Model: Potential Natural Vegetation Group: Pocosin. n.p. (2005). PDF. 9 Oct. 2013. The Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1984 to help preserve pocosin wetlands. Characteristics Pocosins occupy poorly drained higher ground between streams and floodplains. Seeps cause the inundation. There are often perched water tables underlying pocosins. Shrub vegetation is common in a pocosin ecosystem. Pocosins are sometimes called shrub bogs. Pond pines (Pinus serotina) dominate pocosin forests, but loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) are also associated with pocosins. Additionally, pocosins are home to rare and threatened plant species including Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) and sweet pitcher plant (Sarracenia rubra). Pocosin forested by pond pines and white cedars A distinction is sometimes made between short pocosins, which have shorter trees (less than ), deeper peat, and fewer soil nutrients, and tall pocosins, which have taller trees (greater than ), shallow peat, and more nutrient-rich soil. Where soil saturation is less frequent and peat depths shallower, pocosins transition into pine flatwoods. A loose definition of \\"pocosin\\" can include all shrub and forest bogs, as well as stands of Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) and loblolly pine on the Atlantic coastal plain. A stricter definition (promulgated by A. W. Kuchler) restricts pocosins to shrubby \\"short pocosins\\" and pond pine-forested \\"tall pocosins\\". Pocosins are formed by the accumulation of organic matter, resembling black muck, that is built up over thousands of years. This accumulation of material causes the area to be highly acidic and nutrient-deficient. The thickness of the organic buildup varies depending on one's location within the pocosin. Near the edges the buildup can be several inches thick but toward the center it can be up to several feet thick. Vegetation on the pocosin varies throughout. At the edges more pond pine is found with an abundance of titi, zenobia (a shrub unique to pocosins), and greenbrier vines.Pocosin Wilderness. Wilderness, n.p. n.d. Web. 9 Oct. 2013. Closer to the center thin, stunted trees are typically found however fewer shrubs and vines are present.Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain. n.p. n.d. PDF. 9 Oct. 2013. Pocosins are very important for birds that live in cold climates during the winter months and migrate southward. The abundance of various types of available berries draws birds from colder areas. Pocosin ecosystems are fire-adapted (pyrophytic). Pond pines exhibit serotiny, such that wildfire can create a pond pine seedbed in the soil. Wildfires in pocosins tend to be intense, sometimes burning deep into the peat, resulting in small lakes and ponds. Wildfires occurring about once a decade tend to cause pond pines to dominate over other trees, and cane (Arundinaria) rather than shrubs to dominate the understory. More frequent fires result in a pyrophytic shrub understory. Annual fires prevent shrub growth and thin the pond pine forest cover, creating a flooded savanna with grass, sedge, and herb groundcover. The word pocosin comes from an Eastern Algonquian word meaning \\"swamp-on-a-hill\\", however, a more accurate description of a pocosin would be a \\"raised bog\\". The city of Poquoson, Virginia, located in the coastal plain of Virginia (see Tidewater region of Virginia), derives its name from this geographic feature.

History What is now called Beach Boulevard is actually an extension that was added to the original, post-Civil War road called Hogan Road, which stretched from the South bank of the St Johns River downtown, and led Southeast across the bridge over Little Pottsburg Creek and moved onward toward St Augustine. Hogan Road was named after the Hogan Family that were the first white settlers in Duval County. Hogan Road had two sections, the Northbank section moving north from the north bank of the St Johns River downtown, and the Southbank section moving south from the south bank of the St Johns River downtown. In the late 1930s, a new road called Beach Boulevard was built from the beaches toward Downtown Jacksonville until it intersected with the Southbank section of Hogan Road just west of what is now called Parental Home Road. The Southbank section of Hogan Road between Parental Home Road and the South bank of the St Johns River downtown was renamed Beach Boulevard and added to the new section, thus allowing the new Beach Boulevard to exist under one name from the South bank of the St Johns River, all the way out to the Atlantic Ocean. Other changes were made in the 1950s, when Interstate I-95 bisected the new Beach Blvd just south of the riverbank. All that is left of the original Hogan Road is the Northbank section downtown, and a small piece of the original Southbank section that stretches from just west of Parental Home Road South across the Little Pottsburg Creek, and ends at the intersection of Southside Boulevard. Prior to the 1945 renumbering, it was State Road 376, added to the state road system by the Florida Legislature in 1937. The road was built on the right-of-way of the Florida East Coast Railway Mayport Branch (Jacksonville and Atlantic Railroad) to relieve traffic on the parallel Atlantic Boulevard (pre-1945 State Road 140, now State Road 10).Patton, Charlie: \\"Piney Woods Miracle\\" Florida Times- Union, November 23, 2000 Construction began before World War II but was suspended between fall 1941 and 1945.

He was an apprentice under George Frederick Bodley and went on to great success popularizing the Gothic Revival style. Life Vaughan was born in Cheshire, England. When he was a child, his family relocated to Dollar in Clackmannanshire, Scotland. He attended Dollar Academy, and was awarded a bronze medal in art from the school in 1863. He then began his apprenticeship under Bodley, eventually becoming head draftsman at the firm of Bodley and Garner. In 1881, Vaughan came to America traveling on the Atlantic Clipper a packet owned by the Glidden and Williams Shipping Company - whose founder William T Glidden lived in Newcastle, ME. Vaughan knew Mr. Glidden and lived at his home on Glidden street in Newcastle ME in 1881 - 1883 in Newcastle, Maine where he designed and built St. Andrews Church( www.standrewsnewcastle.org) which was dedicated on November 22, 1883 on Glidden Street. Later Vaughn moved to Boston and opened an office in Pemberton Square. He married Mary Shellow a few years later and they had ten children together. He rapidly found success with the Anglican (Episcopal) and Catholic churches. His first commission( not true??- please see above) in the USA was the Chapel of the Society of Saint Margaret.

The term is defined in many income tax treaties and in most European Union Value Added Tax systems. The tax systems in some civil-law countries impose income taxes and value-added taxes only where an enterprise maintains a PE in the country concerned. For example, Germany taxes non-German companies only on income from a PE. Definitions of PEs under tax law or tax treaties may contain specific inclusions or exclusions.  History  The concept of PE emerged in the German Empire after 1845, culminating with the German Double Taxation Act of 1909. Initially, the objective was to prevent double taxation between Prussian municipalities, and this was extended to the entire German federation. In 1889, the first bilateral tax treaty, including the concept of PE, was concluded between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Prussia, marking the first time the concept was used in international tax law.First tax treaty of 1899 After years of preparatory works, in 1928, the League of Nations developed a model to tackle cross-border double taxation and to counter tax evasion. Since then, an extensive network of bilateral tax treaties was gradually established, particularly through the influence of the OECD Model Tax Convention, where this concept persisted.  Types  In the OECD Model Tax Convention, essentially three types of PEs can be construed: * A fixed place of business PE (article 5(1)); * A construction or project PE, which is a special subset of the fixed place of business PE, with different requirements (article 5(3)); and * An agency PE, through the actions of a dependent agent (article 5(5-6)). The UN Model Tax Convention, which gives greater consideration to developing countries, adds what is known as a service PE in article 5(3)b. Some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, have been trying to extend the concept of service PE into a virtual service PE. Under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project being developed by the OECD and endorsed by the G20, a new nexus based on significant digital presence is being considered under Action 1, aimed at Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy. Fixed place of business The starting point for determination if a PE exists is generally a fixed place of business. The definition of PE in article 5 of the OECD Model Income Tax Treaty is followed in most income tax treaties.See, e.g., the U.S./UK treaty Article 5, which is virtually identical to the OECD Model Article 5. The Nigeria/South Africa treaty Article 5, is nearly identical to the OECD Model Article 5, with the addition of a provision clarifying that a fixed place of business used as a sales outlet is a PE, notwithstanding exclusions elsewhere in the article. The commentary indicates that a fixed place of business has three components: *Fixed refers to a link between the place of business and a specific geographic point, as well as a degree of permanence with respect to the taxpayer. An \\"office hotel\\" may constitute a fixed place for a business for an enterprise that regularly uses different offices within the space. By contrast, where there is no commercial coherence, the fact that activities may be conducted within a limited geographic area should not result in that area being considered a fixed place of business. *A place of business. This refers to some facilities used by an enterprise for carrying out its business. The premises must be at the disposal of the enterprise. The mere presence of the enterprise at that place does not necessarily mean that it is a place of business of the enterprise. The facilities need not be the exclusive location, and they need not be used exclusively by that enterprise or for that business. However, the facilities must be those of the taxpayer, not another unrelated person. Thus, regular use of a customer's premises does not generally constitute a place of business. *Business of the enterprise must be carried on wholly or partly at the fixed place. The requirements of what constitutes a PE within the scope of a particular treaty depend on what interpretation a particular country places on that term, in context of the text of that treaty. As per Article 3 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, no one is entitled to claim rights under a particular treaty unless otherwise authorised by the contracting state. Therefore, if a particular contracting state places a different meaning on the term 'permanent establishment' than what the taxpayer seeks to place, the taxpayer would be left with virtually no remedy within that state, other than to seek a mutual agreement to that dispute with the other contracting state to that treaty. Indicative list of permanent establishments The OECD Model Tax Convention includes a short indicative list of prima facie PEs. These, however, are not automatically PEs as the requirements set out, namely, for a fixed place of business PE must be met. The list is as follows: * A branch * A warehouse (but see excluded places below) * A factory * A mine or place of extraction of natural resources * A place of management Specifically excluded places Many treaties explicitly exclude from the definition of PE places where certain activities are conducted. Generally, these exclusions do not apply if non-excluded activities are conducted at the fixed place of business. Among the excluded activities are: *Ancillary or preparatory activities *The use of a storage facility solely for delivery of goods to customers *The maintenance of a stock of goods owned by the enterprise solely for purposes of processing by another enterprise (sometimes referred to as toll processing) *Purchasing or information gathering activities Other specific provisions= Construction or Project PE  Many treaties provide specific rules with respect to construction sites. Under those treaties, a building site or construction or installation project constitutes a PE only if it lasts more than a specified length of time. The amount of time varies by treaty.For example, the Canada/Belgium treaty sets this limit as 12 months, as does the OECD Model. By contrast, the US/India treaty treats such a site, project or activities continuing for more than 120 days in any twelve-month period as a PE.  Agency PE  In addition, the activities of a dependent agentSee Agency (law) for a discussion of the essential characteristics of agent and principal. may give rise to a PE for the principal. Dependent agents may include employees or others under the control of the principal. A company is generally not considered an agent solely by reason of ownership of the agent company by the principal. However, activities of an independent agent generally are not attributed to the principal.  Service PE  Some treaties deem a PE to exist for an enterprise of one country performing services in the other country for more than a specified length of timeSee, e.g., the United Nations Model Tax Convention Article 5 paragraph 3(b). or for a related enterprise.See, e.g., the US/India treaty, supra., Article 5 paragraph 2(l).  BEPS Action 7 and 15  In October 2015, the OECD released the final reports on the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. Action 7 was targeted at Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status and proposes a large number of changes that are set to be included in the next version of the OECD Model Tax Convention. The OECD expects many of these changes to be applied to currently existing tax treaties through the work based on Action 15 on Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties. A large number of countries are involved in the negotiations that are expected to be concluded by the end of 2016. The final report on Action 7 proposes substantial changes to the definition of Agency PE and stricter requirements to the exclusions provision: > \\"These changes will ensure that where the activities that an intermediary > exercises in a country are intended to result in the regular conclusion of > contracts to be performed by a foreign enterprise, that enterprise will be > considered to have a taxable presence in that country unless the > intermediary is performing these activities in the course of an independent > business. > The changes will also restrict the application of a number of exceptions to > the definition of permanent establishment to activities that are preparatory > or auxiliary nature and will ensure that it is not possible to take > advantage of these exceptions by the fragmentation of a cohesive operating > business into several small operations; they will also address situations > where the exception applicable to construction sites is circumvented through > the splitting-up contracts between closely related enterprises.\\" References International taxation Corporate taxation International law ","title":"Permanent establishment"},{"id":"6327295","text":"Ida Irene Dalser (20 August 1880 ‚Äì 3 December 1937) was the first wife of Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Early life Ida Dalser was born in Sopramonte, a village near Trento (Trient), which was then within the borders of the County of Tyrol in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The daughter of the town mayor, she was sent to Paris to study cosmetic medicine. When she returned, she moved to Milan, where she opened a French-style beauty salon. Marriage and motherhood It is unclear whether Ida Dalser first met young Benito Mussolini in Trento, where he had found his first job as a journalist in 1909, or in Milan, where he had moved soon afterwards. The two started a relationship, and when Mussolini was refused work on the basis of his fervent socialist political activity, she financed him with the revenues of her beautician job. According to some sources, they married in 1914,Serena, \\"L'altra moglie di Mussolini\\". and in 1915 she bore him his first child, Benito Albino Mussolini. Though Fascist agents sought to erase all traces of the relationship, an edict from the city of Milan ordering Mussolini to make maintenance payments to \\"his wife Ida Dalser\\" and their child was overlooked. Persecution and death In 1917, Mussolini came back from the war. His political career accelerated, and in 1919 he went on to found the Fasci italiani di combattimento. In 1921, it became the National Fascist Party, and in the same year, he was also elected to the Chamber of Deputies. With the 1922 March on Rome, Mussolini seized power and became a dictator who was officially recognised by the reigning House of Savoy. Once Mussolini was in power, Ida Dalser and her son were placed under surveillance by the police, and paper evidence of their relationship was tracked down to be destroyed by government agents. She persisted in continuing to claim her role as the dictator's wife and even publicly denounced Mussolini as a traitor. She said that during his years in Milan, he had accepted a bribe from the French government, in exchange for political campaigning in support of the involvement of neutral Italy in the war on the side of France. Eventually, she was transferred to the island of San Clemente in Venice, where she died in 1937. The cause of death was officially given as a \\"brain hemorrhage\\". Fate of Benito Albino Benito Albino Mussolini was abducted by government agents and was told that his mother was dead. In 1931, he was adopted as an orphan at 15 by the fascist ex-police chief of Sopramonte. Initially educated at a Barnabite college in Moncalieri, he enrolled in the Italian Royal Navy and always remained under close surveillance by the fascist government. Nevertheless, he persisted in stating that Benito Mussolini was his father and was eventually forcibly interned in an asylum in Mombello, Province of Milan, where he was murdered on 26 August 1942 after repeated coma-inducing injections, at 26. In film The story of Benito Mussolini's first marriage was suppressed during the fascist rule and remained generally unknown for years afterwards. It was resurrected in 2005 by Italian journalist Marco Zeni and made public in a documentary on RAI state television as well as in two books (L'ultimo fil√≤ and La moglie di Mussolini). Vincere, a biopic on Dalser's life that was directed by Marco Bellocchio and starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno, was screened at the 2009 American Film Institute Festival and in competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.

The band is known for their 1967 hit \\"Been Burnt\\". Band members included Canadian guitarist Mike McKenna, Luke Gibson, Peter Jermyn, Jim Jones, and Pat Little. The band is considered to be innovators of the electric blues in the Toronto music scene of the sixties. Many of the band members went on to form other notable Canadian bands such as McKenna Mendelson Mainline, Kensington Market and The Modern Rock Quartet (The MRQ). Early years Luke & The Apostles emerged from the blues band Mike's Trio in 1964. The group was the brainchild of school friends, guitarist Mike McKenna (born April 15, 1946 in Toronto), who had previously played in Whitey & The Roulettes, and bass player Graham Dunsmore. Joining forces with drummer Rick McMurray, Mike's Trio started gigging at the Cellar club in Toronto's Yorkville Village playing Jimmy Reed covers, \\"Walkin' the Dog\\", etc. Sometime in late 1964, McMurray introduced singer Luke Gibson (born October 5, 1946 in Toronto), who was joined soon afterwards by classically trained keyboard player Peter Jermyn (born November 6, 1946 in Kingston, Ontario). After Jermyn coined the name, Luke & The Apostles ‚Äì a reference to a very successful local group called Robbie Lane and the Disciples ‚Äì became a regular fixture on the local club scene, first working at the El Patio and then later the Purple Onion. The group signs to Elektra Shortly before the band started playing at the Purple Onion, a new bass player, Jim Jones, was brought in to replace Graham Dunsmore while Ray Bennett augmented the lineup on harmonica for several months (later joining The Heavenly Government) and ended up composing \\"Been Burnt\\", the A-side to Luke & The Apostles‚Äô solitary single for Elektra Records. One evening in September 1965, Elektra talent scout, Paul Rothchild caught the band at the Purple Onion and asked singer Luke Gibson to audition the band for his label boss, Jac Holzman by singing over the phone! After signing a deal with Elektra, the band flew down to New York and recorded two tracks, Bennett's \\"Been Burnt\\" backed by McKenna's \\"Don‚Äôt Know Why\\" for a prospective single. The two recordings were readied for release but then disaster struck. Paul Rothchild was arrested for marijuana possession and the single was delayed for a year while he served a prison sentence. Over the summer Jim Jones left the band and was replaced for five months by Dennis Pendrith (born September 13, 1949 in Toronto). On July 21, 1966, Luke & The Apostles found a new home at Boris‚Äô in Toronto, where the band continued to play throughout 1966 and until the summer of 1967. During this period, the group also played occasional dates at the El Patio and the Gogue Inn among other venues. (\\"I don't remember the Gogue Inn, but I do remember a lot of high schools and northern 'tours': Elliot Lake, Sault Ste. Marie, North Bay, etc., and Montreal and Ottawa.\\" - P. Jermyn) One of the most prestigious shows the group played during this time was a 14-hour-long rock show held at Maple Leaf Gardens on September 24, 1966, alongside the cream of the city's local bands. The following month, however, Jim Jones returned to the group's ranks and Pendrith returned to his previous employer Simon Caine & The Catch. At the same time, Pat Little came in to replace Rick McMurray on drums. On October 15, 1966, Luke & The Apostles joined local bands, The Counts, The Big Town Boys and The Canadian Del-Tones for a show at the recently opened Club Kingsway in Toronto opening for Neil Diamond. Soon afterwards, Peter Jermyn briefly left the band for a few months and was replaced by Bob Kendall, who joined The Bedtime Story in December 1966 when Jermyn returned. Albert Grossman and Bill Graham‚Äôs interest On January 6, 1967, Luke & The Apostles played at the newly opened, Boris‚Äô Red Gas Room, upstairs from Boris‚Äô. Although the group's single had still not been released, the opportunity to return to New York in mid-April to perform at the Cafe au Go Go for a week bode well for the future. While Elektra had decided not to release the single, the label still expressed an interest in recording the band. During its time at the Cafe au Go Go, Elektra booked the group into its New York studios for a day to record an album's worth of material, including the tracks, \\"I Don‚Äôt Feel Like Trying\\" and \\"So Long Girl\\". In its first stand at the Cafe au Go Go, Luke & The Apostles backed folkie Dave Van Ronk but were so well received that the club owner asked the band to return for on a second week in late May, opening for The Grateful Dead. During one of the Cafe au Go Go shows, Bob Dylan and Paul Butterfield Blues Band‚Äôs manager Albert Grossman and rock promoter Bill Graham approached the band offering a management contract. Bill Graham also promised the band a slot at the Fillmore West in California that summer. The group fragments Unable to reconcile differences over the potential offers as well as differences in personal ambitions, the group returned to Toronto to reassess its future. Shortly afterwards, Bill Graham approached Luke & The Apostles and asked them to open for Jefferson Airplane and The Grateful Dead at Toronto‚Äôs Nathan Philips Square on July 23, 1967 in front of 50,000. Luke & The Apostles repeated their support act at the O‚ÄôKeefe Centre from July 31-August 5, during which the group performed a version of Neil Young‚Äôs \\"Mr Soul\\", as well as covers of blues favourites \\"Good Morning Little School Girl\\" and \\"You Can‚Äôt Judge A Book By The Cover\\". However, following a show at Boris‚Äô Red Gas Room on August 6, Luke Gibson accepted an offer to join the progressive folk-rock outfit, Kensington Market and the rest of the band members went their separate ways. After passing on an offer to join The Blues Project, Peter Jermyn moved to Ottawa to join the band Heart, which evolved into The Modern Rock Quartet. Jim Jones meanwhile played with several Toronto bands, including The Artist Jazz Band. McKenna joined The Ugly Ducklings before forming the highly respected blues outfit, McKenna Mendelson Mainline in the summer of 1968. Little joined forces with future Blood, Sweat & Tears‚Äô singer David Clayton-Thomas in his group David Clayton-Thomas Combine in February 1968 (appearing on the original version of \\"Spinning Wheel\\") and then joined The Georgian IV People (later better known as Chimo!). The band reforms Gibson, McKenna and Little discussed the idea of reforming the band in February, 1970. To complete the lineup, they recruited former Transfusion and Leather guitarist Danny McBride on second lead guitar and ex-The Paupers bass player Denny Gerrard (born February 28, 1947 in Scarborough, Ontario). The new lineup, however, only lasted a few days and former Buffalo Springfield bass player Bruce Palmer (born September 9, 1946 in Toronto) replaced Gerrard. On February 15, the new lineup opened for Johnny Winter at Toronto's Massey Hall. However, due to musical differences and personality conflicts, the lineup remained unsettled. Former Influence bass player, Jack Geisinger (born March, 1945 in Czechoslovakia) replaced Palmer later that month and Luke & The Apostles performed at Toronto's Electric Circus on March 13‚Äì14, before appearing at the Toronto Rock Festival at Varsity Arena on March 26 alongside Funkadelic, Nucleus, Damage and others. The new lineup recorded a lone single for Bernie Finkelstein‚Äôs True North Records, which coupled Gibson, McKenna and Little‚Äôs \\"You Make Me High\\" with Gibson's \\"Not Far Off\\". Arguably one of the best records to come out of the Toronto scene from this period, the single reached #27 on Canada's RPM chart in October 1970. The end of the reunion The band embarked on a brief tour of Boston with Mountain in early April. Luke & The Apostles then returned to Toronto to play at the Electric Circus on May 9 after which McKenna left to rejoin his former band, now going by the name Mainline. The group then appeared at the \\"Peace Festival\\" at Varsity Arena on June 19‚Äì21 with Rare Earth, the SRC, Bush, George Olliver & Natural Gas, Nucleus and others before McBride also departed. He later became a member of Chris De Burgh‚Äôs backing band. Luke & The Apostles turned to Geisinger‚Äôs former Influence compatriot, Walter Rossi (born on May 29, 1947 in Naples, Italy), who was playing with The Buddy Miles Express at the time. With Rossi added to the lineup, Luke & The Apostles made a prestigious appearance at the Strawberry Fields Festival at Mosport Park, Ontario over the weekend of August 7‚Äì8, 1970. The group also made a number of appearances at the Canadian National Exhibition bandstand later that month. On September 1, 1970, the group made a one-off appearance at Ungano's in New York before returning to Toronto but the end was in sight. Shortly after a show at Kipling Collegiate on October 9, Luke Gibson left for a solo career followed by Pat Little and the remaining members recruited ex-Wizard drummer Mike Driscoll, performing as The Apostles before splitting in early 1971. Rossi went on to record a heavy rock album as Charlee in early 1972 with help from Geisinger and Driscoll before embarking on a successful solo career. Gibson recorded a lone album for True North Records with help from Dennis Pendrith, Jim Jones and Bruce Cockburn but later eschewed a singing career. He now works as a film set painter. Little rejoined Chimo! for the band‚Äôs final single and then hooked up with Rick James in Heaven and Earth for two singles on RCA Victor in July 1971. He then played with Flag and also reunited with McKenna to record two 45s and an unreleased album with DiamondBack, which has just been released by Pacemaker Records. 1990s revival In the late 1990s, Gibson, Jermyn, Jones and McKenna reformed the group with future Downchild Blues Band drummer Mike Fitzpatrick for the \\"Toronto Rock Revival\\" concert held at the Warehouse on May 2, 1999. Later that year Jermyn, Jones and McKenna became house band at the Yorkville club, Blues on Bellair and were joined intermittently by Gibson. The group continues to perform occasionally on the Toronto live scene. Current In 2009 McKenna and Gibson began talking about putting a new band together and playing on a regular basis. The decision was made and the McKenna-Gibson Band was formed featuring David Martin on drums and percussion; William (Bill) Miller on bass; and Frank Sedlak on keyboards, vibes and backup vocals. The set list is made up of a mix of Mainline and Apostles' material, blues standards, and new material penned primarily by Luke Gibson. The band made a successful debut at Toronto's Black Swan Tavern on December 12, 2009. In 2013 The band has reformed again with 3 original members, Gibson, Mckenna, and Jermyn. and currently performs occasionally live in the Toronto area to a predominantly \\"nostalgia\\" crowd. In 2017, the self-titled album Luke & The Apostles was released on True North Records. Arriving more than 50 years after their first single \\"Been Burnt,\\" it is the band's first full-length release.

Roots The band was the brainchild of guitarist Louis Campbell McKelvey (born 31 October 1943 in Killorgin, County Kerry, Ireland). McKelvey, who had spent the early ‚Äò60s playing in west London band, Jeff Curtis & The Flames and recorded with South African bands The Upsetters and The A-Cads between September 1965 and April 1966. Having arrived in Montreal around October 1966, he initially found work with the French-speaking group, Les Sinners, playing a one-off date with them at Paul Sauve Arena before briefly hooking up with Our Generation in December for a lone single. Formation Through a chance meeting with The Haunted's guitarist Jurgen Peter, McKelvey met former Haunted drummer Dave Wynne (born May 17, 1947 in Stockport, England) and recruited him for the new project he was planning. Around the same time, he also befriended bass player Jack Geisinger (born Jakob August Geisinger, March 1945 in Czechoslovakia) who had recently been playing with The Buddy Miles Quartet but was currently unemployed after Wilson Pickett recruited the group for a US tour. The last member to join this original lineup was English singer Andrew Keiller (born August 16, 1941 in Bodmin, Cornwall, England), who had previously worked with McKelvey in The Upsetters in late 1965 and before that, recorded a solo album in Johannesburg, which was belatedly released in 1966. Keiller, who had moved to Montreal in April 1966, had seen McKelvey playing with Our Generation on a local TV station and contacted him. Band history Influence debuted on 1 June 1967 at the Barrel, a small Montreal club. Later that month the band added Geisinger's former colleagues from The Buddy Miles Quartet, singer/songwriter and pianist Bob Parkins (aka Bobo Island) and lead guitarist Walter Rossi. The three musicians had previously played together in the early ‚Äò60s with Bob & The Messengers and The Soul Mates. In late August, the group relocated to Toronto, playing Boris‚Äô Red Gas Room in the city's Yorkville Village on September 2, 1967. They then performed regularly at the venue over the next two months before travelling to New York during November to record an album for ABC Records at Bell Studios with producer Dennis Minogue (aka Terry Cashman). Released in January 1968, the album included the mini-opera 'Mad Birds of Prey', which was \\"more echoes of Weill's Threepenny Opera than of anything around in rock\\".Roxon, Lillian: Lilian Roxon's Rock Encyclopedia (Grosset and Dunlop, Universal Library Edition, 1972) p251 The band then shuttled between Toronto and New York, performing a string of dates at Boris‚Äô Red Gas Room throughout the first half of December, then returning to New York to launch the album at Steve Paul's The Scene, opening for Blood, Sweat & Tears over the Christmas and New Year period. During the festivities, Buddy Miles (now with The Electric Flag) joined the band on stage. However, the album's failure, together with internal conflict, resulted in Dave Wynne's departure in January 1968. Back in Montreal, Influence replaced Wynne with former Soul Mates‚Äô drummer Frank LoRusso (aka Yum Yum). The new line up returned to Toronto in mid-February to perform at Boris‚Äô and continued to play local gigs, including an extended date at the city‚Äôs Penny Farthing club from March 4‚Äì9, before landing a support slot at The Doors‚Äô show at the CNE Hall on April 20. Influence then embarked on a brief tour of the US Midwest, supporting Procol Harum at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit from May 17‚Äì19 and Steppenwolf at the Electric Theatre in Chicago from May 24‚Äì26. However, the group was slowly unravelling and in June 1968, Andy Keiller left the band, later returning to the UK before emigrating to Australia in 1971. Back in Toronto, the band resumed live work, appearing at the El Patio from August 31- September 1, but soon afterwards founding member Louis McKelvey left the band and returned to England. The remaining musicians carried on as Influence but broke up in early 1969 when Walter Rossi joined The Buddy Miles Express. Aftermath In March 1969, Louis McKelvey returned to Canada with his former Jeff Curtis & The Flames compatriot Malcolm Tomlinson and together they formed Milkwood who recorded an unreleased LP for Polydor Records with producer Jerry Ragovoy. Geisinger was also involved with the sessions. When Milkwood broke up in late 1969, Geisinger became a brief member of McKelvey's next project, Damage, which also featured latter day Influence drummer, Yum Yum. McKelvey abandoned his music career in the early ‚Äò70s, but remained in Toronto. In February 1970 Geisinger joined Luke & The Apostles and later that year brought in Rossi. The group evolved into The Apostles before disbanding in 1971. Both musicians then collaborated on an LP as Charlee. Rossi later established a successful solo career while Geisinger recorded with the group, Bombers. Bobo Island, who had appeared on Buddy Miles‚Äô single \\"Them Changes\\" with Rossi, died in a highway accident in late 1969.

His call for the conference gained 10,000 adherents including Victor Hugo, John Stuart Mill, Elis√©e Reclus, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Louis Blanc and Mikhail Bakunin. Karl Marx was dismissive and urged the newly formed International Workingmen's Association to have no official involvement. Acollas insisted that the first Conference, held in Geneva, should be called a \\"revolutionary conference\\". At the subsequent conference held in 1869 in Lausanne, Acollas attacked the very idea of monarchy. But the League was to collapse with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. In 1870 Acollas had the post at the University of Berne, when the Paris Commune appointed him Dean of the Law Faculty of the University of Paris. However he never took up the post and avoided any recriminations, returning to Paris in 1871. He set up the Acollas Law School primarily for foreign students wishing to attend the University of Paris. Georges Clemenceau and the Japanese noble Saionji Kinmochi were both linked to the school. Saionji was to continue to visit Acollas, and later described him as his best friend in Europe. Acollas was interested in oriental language and became a member of the Japanese Research Society. Other Japanese students included Nakae Chomin who was active in the Japanese Freedom and People's Rights Movement. Acollas took a critical view of Rousseau's theory of rights, arguing that his ideas on individual autonomy would lead to a dictatorship of the majority. Rather he proposed a republican system of representative government. His student Nakae translated Rousseau's Social Contract and became known as the \\"Rousseau of the East\\". Acollas ran unsuccessfully in the French general election in 1876 calling for a complete amnesty for the communards, calling for a decentralised federalism, revocable mandates for elected representatives and free association a way of gaining an equitable distribution of goods. These demands were similar to Bakunin's proposals at the League for Peace and Freedom and are also present in the demands of the Japanese Popular Rights Movement. Acollas is mentioned in Nakae's book A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government 1887, where a character called \\"Shinshikun\\" (Highbrow) remarks: :Recently when the French philosopher Emile Acollas classified all the various kinds of laws, he ranked international law in terms of morality rather than jurisprudence. According to Acollas . . . (m)orality, unlike law, is made effective by the dictates of individual conscience. Similarly international law has no officials to enforce it, but depends instead only on the 'consciences' of the nations involved.

It is part of the Isle of Oxney. History The Domesday Book of 1086 does not mention Wittersham, but it does assign the manor of Palstre to Odo, Bishop of Bayeux. Palstre was only one of four places in the Weald, apparently, that had a church. The Domesday Book entry reads:- \\"In Oxenai hundred, Osbern Paisforiere holds Palestrei, from the Bishop. It is taxed at three yokes. Arable land for two ploughs. In demesne, nine smallholders have half a plough. There is a church, 2 servants, of meadow, 5 fisheries at twelve pence, woodland for the pannage of 10 hogs. In the time of Edward the Confessor, it was worth forty shillings, now sixty shillings. Edwy the priest held it for King Edward.\\" An early variation of the village name may be Wyghtresham. Manor Early in the 18th century, the manor came into the ownership of Thomas Brodnax or May of Godmersham Park, Kent. May changed his name to Knight after inheriting estates from the Knight family in 1738 and, on his death in 1781, Owley passed to his son Thomas. The younger Thomas Knight died childless in 1794, and Owley passed to his widow Catherine, later of White Friars, Canterbury. Mrs Knight was lady of the manor in 1799, when Hasted wrote. When she died in 1812, her husband's estates passed to his adopted son, Edward Austen Knight, brother of novelist Jane Austen, and owner of Chawton House in Hampshire. Some time later, Edward Knight appears to have sold Owley to William Levett of Bodiam. When he died in 1842, Levett owned both the manors of Palstre (where he lived) and Owley. He left Paltre to his elder daughter Sabina and Owley to his younger daughter Emily. His Will devised to Emily \\"my freeholds, messuages, buildings, farm lands, containing altogether, by estimation, one hundred and seventy-two acres, more or less, situate lying and being in the Parish of Wittersham aforesaid, commonly called or known by the name of Owley Farm, with the apportionments thereto belonging\\". Emily Levett married Samuel Rutley, and the Rutley family continued to own the manor until the end of the 19th century. At the turn of the 20th century, by which time holding the manor had ceased to be equivalent with ownership of most land and property, the Body family held Wittersham, Colonel Heyworth held Palstre, and Mrs Samuel Rutley owned Owley. Amenities The village has an award-winning CAMRA approved public house, The Swan, and a restored white weatherboarded post mill, Stocks Mill. Wittersham housed a key listening post for downed pilots over the channel during the Second World War; all that is left now is a small concrete house and a few craters dotted around from attacks by the Luftwaffe and several doodlebug (V1) strikes. There is a popular and well-attended Community market every Tuesday morning in the Village Hall specialising in organic and local fresh food as well as a variety of other products. Wittersham now has its own dedicated website www.wittersham.org run from within the village with information regarding local groups, businesses, what's on, and Lost & Found. The website is being continually improved and is currently funded by the Wittersham Parish Council.

(Inuit for \\"Hello\\") was a Canadian jazz-rock/jazz fusion band, founded in 1969. The band played with some of the biggest acts of their era, and recorded one album, Cross Country Man for Revolver Records. History Chimo! evolved from Georgian IV, a band formed in Parry Sound in 1962 by John Johnson, Ross Raby, Stewart McCann and Rick King. After seven years of increasing success the band saw major personnel changes and, in 1969, changed its name to Chimo!, with the original line-up of Jack Mowbray (guitar), Tony Collacott (keyboards), Ross Raby (keyboards, vocals), John Johnson (guitar), Andy Cree (drums), and Breen La Boeuf (lead vocals). Also in 1969, the band played alongside Chicago at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival and, on June 28, 1970, opened the second day of the Festival Express with The Band and Janis Joplin at the Canadian National Exhibition Stadium. They also appeared at the Midsummer Night Rock Festival at Michigan State Fairgrounds Coliseum with Alice Cooper, Iggy & The Stooges, and others. Following the release of the band's album Cross Country Man in November 1970, Andy Cree left to do sessions for David Wiffen before joining Anne Murray's band. He was replaced by Pat Little, who had previously been with Luke & The Apostles, and had been doing session work for Van Morrison and Peter, Paul & Mary. The new line-up was responsible for two singles, Little's \\"In The Sea\\" and Mowbray's \\"Cross Country Man\\". In 1971, Raby, Johnson and Collacott left the band to start families. Little joined the band Heaven and Earth, and then founded the band Flag. LeBoeuf joined a re-formed Motherlode and, in 1977, Offenbach.

The band, which was active between late 1967 and early 1968, also featured Neil Merryweather and future Mapleoak members, Marty Fisher and Gordon MacBain. The Mynah Birds After leaving The Mynah Birds (sometimes spelt Myna Byrds) in early September 1967, Neil Lillie (later better known as Neil Merryweather) was introduced to ex-Esquires member Bruce Cockburn through The Five Man Electrical Band. The pair decided to launch a new group and recruited former Bobby Kris & The Imperials members Martin Fisher and Gordon MacBain who were playing at the Concorde Tavern in Toronto at the time. Signed to Harvey Glatt‚Äôs management, The Flying Circus recorded a number of unreleased tracks in Toronto during late 1967, including Cockburn‚Äôs ‚ÄúFlying Circus‚Äù, ‚ÄúShe Wants To Know‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Leaving You Out‚Äù and ‚ÄúMother‚Äù as well as Lillie‚Äôs ‚ÄúLast Hoorah‚Äù and ‚ÄúElephant Song‚Äù and Fisher and MacBain‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhere Is All The Love‚Äù. During the same sessions, the band also recorded songs by Cockburn‚Äôs former The Children cohort, William Hawkins, such as ‚ÄúMerry Go Round‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs A Dirty Shame‚Äù and ‚ÄúLittle Bit Stoned‚Äù.Later versions of which may be found on the tribute album, Dancing Alone: Songs of William Hawkins (True North, 2008), involving the participation of Cockburn. Around this time, the group also recorded a few tracks with another former Children member Sandy Crawley, which were never released. On October 1, the band began a residence at Le Hibou in Ottawa. The following month, from November 14‚Äì18, 1967, The Flying Circus played at the Riverboat in Toronto. Over the next few months, the group also opened for Wilson Pickett and Roy Orbison at the Capitol Theatre in Ottawa.

It stars Jacques Dutronc, Isabelle Huppert, and Nathalie Baye, with a score by Gabriel Yared. Nathalie Baye won the C√©sar Award for Best Supporting Actress. Constructed as a musical piece, it has a prologue followed by three movements, each of which focuses on one of the three key characters and their interactions with the others, and ends with a coda. Throughout the film an unnamed piece of music recurs, which is the aria Suicidio! (Suicide!) from the opera La Gioconda by Ponchielli. Serving as leitmotiv for the whole story, it underscores the innate death-wish haunting the central character. Plot The prologue introduces Paul Godard, a filmmaker, and his estranged girlfriend, Denise, in which a stressed Paul leaves the deluxe hotel to which he has moved and rebuffs the sexual advances of a male hotel attendant. The first section, \\"The Imaginary,\\" follows Denise as she takes her first steps to an independent life without Paul. She lands a manual job on a local paper run by an old friend, perhaps an old lover, in a country town and gets a room on a farm in return for helping with the cattle. She is also writing up some new project, which may become a novel. At the same time, she has to complete her job at the television station where she and Paul work, as well as find a new tenant for her flat in the city where she and Paul have been living together. Realising she is late to collect the author and filmmaker Marguerite Duras for an interview, she telephones Paul to ask if he can do it for her. Despite being in no mood to agree with her, he accepts. The second section, \\"Fear,\\" focuses on Paul. He is afraid of life without Denise, perhaps of life itself. After picking up his surly daughter C√©cile from soccer practice, at which seemingly apropos of nothing he asks the coach if he has ever felt like touching or having sex with his own daughter, he fulfils his favour to Denise by collecting Marguerite Duras from a local college, where she was due to give a talk. When she refuses to do so (her voice is heard but she is not shown), Paul reads out some of her notes, in which she says that she only makes films because she lacks the courage to do nothing. Paul says this is true for himself as well. The celebrity then gets Paul to take her back to the airport, after which he has to face a furious Denise who has lost her interviewee. That evening, as it is C√©cile's birthday, he takes her and her mother to a restaurant but all his scornful ex-wife wants is money and all the girl wants is presents. Leaving in fury, after again expressing his alienation with inappropriate sexual innuendo, he meets Denise in a bar, where the two quarrel and part. Standing alone in a late-night cinema queue, he is picked up by the prostitute Isabelle. Part Three, \\"Commerce,\\" is Isabelle's section, in which she devotes herself to increasing her earnings in order to achieve independence. After her night with Paul, in which she mechanically goes through the motions while mentally planning her next day, she is waylaid by a pimp who gives her a spanking to remind her that there is no independence in a commercial world and he must have 50% of her earnings. On returning to the apartment she shares with some other women, who all seem to detest her, her younger sister arrives unexpectedly and asks Isabelle for money because her lover and all his associates have just been jailed for robbing a bank. When Isabelle refuses, the sister asks if she will get her started in the local prostitution business. Isabelle agrees to coach her for a month, in exchange for 50% of the take. While continuing to service a variety of clients with different needs, sometimes inventive (one businessman choreographs a foursome while sitting at his desk), and all the while with her mind elsewhere, she is also searching for an apartment of her own. An old school friend she meets in a hotel corridor, probably a dealer and maybe a prostitute as well, offers her a lucrative opportunity to be a courier, but the boss of the operation finds Isabelle too dangerously naive. Going to inspect an apartment, it turns out to be that of Denise, and Paul is also there trying to rekindle the relationship. Isabelle and Denise form an immediate bond. In the coda, entitled \\"Music,\\" Isabelle seems to prosper in her new apartment and Denise has moved on in life. After having spent several days adrift, Paul runs into his ex-wife and daughter and asks plaintively to spend more time with them. Walking backwards away from the two, Paul accidentally steps in front of a car and is hit. Isabelle's sister, now apparently a prostitute, flees the scene with the driver of the car, her client. Paul's ex-wife also urges C√©cile to come away, saying \\"it's nothing to do with us.\\" As the two walk off, they pass a small orchestra set up in a garage yard that is playing the theme music which has echoed through the film. Cast * Jacques Dutronc as Paul Godard * Isabelle Huppert as Isabelle Rivi√®re * Nathalie Baye as Denise Rimbaud * C√©cile Tanner as Cecile, Paul's daughter Background After twelve years of low budget, militant left-wing, and otherwise experimental film and video projects outside of commercial distribution, Every Man for Himself was Godard's return to \\"mainstream\\" filmmaking, with a sizable budget and French film stars. Godard promoted what he referred to as his \\"second first film\\" heavily in the United States, notably appearing on two episodes of The Dick Cavett Show. Nevertheless, in addition to Godard's typical refusal to keep viewers oriented through expository dialogue and continuity editing, the film is experimental in its use of the technique that Godard called \\"decomposition,\\" which he first employed for the 1979 French television series France/tour/d√©tour/deux/enfants. In the technique, there is a periodic slowing down of the action to a frame by frame advancement. Consequently, the film was given the name Slow Motion when it was released in the UK. The French title Sauve Qui Peut literally means \\"save who can,\\" and is a common phrase shouted among a crowd of people when there is dangerhence the American title of the film, Every Man for Himself. Godard has stated that a better title in American English would be \\"Save Your Ass.\\" In his initial proposal for the film, a 20 minute video known as Sc√©nario de Sauve Qui Peut (la vie) (included as a supplement on the Criterion Collection DVD), Godard suggested a guest appearance by Werner Herzog that is not in the finished film, including a still photo that is apparently of Herzog doing a backflip. Perhaps this is a joke, Herzog having made Every Man for Himself and God Against All six years earlier. Poet and author Charles Bukowski provided the subtitles for the film's English-language release. Reception The film premiered at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to garner 620,147 admissions in France. Film critic Vincent Canby, writing in The New York Times, described the film effusively as \\"stunning,\\" \\"beautiful,\\" and \\"brilliant\\". In the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made, Every Man for Himself made the top-10 lists of two critics and two directors.

The team is based in the town of Frederikshavn on the east coast of Northern Jutland, Denmark, and is run by the Frederikshavn Ishockey Klub (F.I.K). History The White Hawks were founded in 1964 and have won the Danish title twice (1989, 2000) and have been runners-up three times (1999, 2008, 2011). Recent history 2007/08 In 2008 they progressed to the final after finishing the regular season seeded 8th (the first team in Danish league history to do so) knocking top seed R√∏dovre out in the first best of 7 series in the 7th game by scoring two late goals to win by 1. They beat S√∏nderjyskE in the semifinal series, but lost the final in five games to the then reigning champions Herning. 2008/09 2009 saw them seeded 7th. If not for the bankruptcy of Hvidovre they would have finished 8th and probably faced Herning and forced their local rivals AaB out of the finals by 1 goal differential. However Hvildovre's bankruptcy left an open slot for AaB and put the White Hawks up a place to face R√∏dovre (second seed) again in the quarterfinals. This was also a very close series with the White Hawks winning three games over the much favored R√∏dovre, and pushing them to game 7 again. R√∏dovre won game 7 fairly easily, but the decisive moment was really R√∏dovre's overtime win in game 4, without which the White Hawks would have progressed after winning game 6. R√∏dovre went on to lose the semifinals to S√∏nderjyskE who beat Herning in the finals. 2009/10 The 09/10 season was a Jekyll and Hyde one for The White Hawks, they were virtually unbeatable at home yet struggled to take points away. Despite this they finished the regular season in a very impressive 3rd behind the 2 favorites S√∏nderjyskE & AaB. 3rd giving them home advantage in the quarterfinals they choose to play R√∏dovre again for the 3rd straight year. Some experts doubted they could progress saying \\"The White Hawks can't win away so all R√∏dovre needs to do is win 1 game away and they will win the series\\". This series would turn out to be another classic, R√∏dovre won the first 2 games despite the White Hawks dominating the first, the 3rd game saw an impressive come from behind win by The White Hawks. The series was really decided with the White Hawks away win in the 4th game, a game that saw a goal scored by White Hawks goalkeeper Frederik Andersen. Andersen had tried to score in game 3 after R√∏dovre pulled their keeper but just missed, in game 4 he made sure of his aim and scored in the empty net. The White Hawks went on to win a close game 5 and then game 7 easily. They were then put out in the semifinals after just 4 games by a dominant S√∏nderjyskE who progressed to easily beat AaB in the finals in only 4 games to claim another championship. The White Hawks lost the bronze playoff to Herning and finished 2009/10 in 4th. Current state 2011 saw the White Hawks finish second to Herning, this along with a profit from the year saw the team sign many import players for the 2011/12 season for the first time in several years. There was a high expectation in the Danish Hockey community that the team could win the title but they never jelled and finished in seventh place losing the quarterfinals to eventual runners-up Odense in four straight games. Looking forward to 2012/13 the team has changed and is again expected to do well.

After marrying in 1960, Mrs. Murray continued teaching at Gander Academy and then she and her husband moved to the St. John's area, choosing to live in the picturesque small town of Mount Pearl (now a much larger city), where she taught at Bishop's College for a few years and then at the College of Trades and Technology (now the College of the North Atlantic) from 1972 until retirement in 1989. In 1972 she completed her MA in Folklore at Memorial University of Newfoundland under Herbert Halpert and was a classmate of Scottish singer and author, Margaret Bennett. Her writing style and choice of subject area is largely influenced by her master's degree in folklore.

The family was naturalized as Swedish Nobility on 14 October 1652, and the family was introduced at the Swedish House of Knights on 20 September 1675. Currently the family has been divided in rank and station: one side of the family was raised to baronial status (Swedish: Friherrelig) in Sweden; another, to baronial level within the Russian Empire in 1869.

History Today's peaceful village was the site of a major villa or palatium in the Merovingian and Carolingian eras, and the site of assemblies of the Frankish nobles, of synods of bishops and abbots and other important events. Here Charles Martel died, 22 October 741. The name of the place appears variously in documents: Cariciacum, Carisiacum, Charisagum, Karisiacum. Of the royal residence of the Merovingians and the house of Pepin, only traces of earthworks remain, in fields outside Quierzy, in the direction of Manicamp. The early medieval Ch√¢teau de Quierzy on the bank of the Oise, rebuilt in the fifteenth century as the fortress of the bishops of Noyon, survives as a single tower. Quierzy was already a significant stronghold of Neustria recorded in events in the Chronicle of Fredegar at the opening of the seventh century, when Protadius, the mayor of the palace of Burgundy was the noble lover of Brunhilda, the grandmother of and regent for King Theuderic II. Brunhilda pressured her grandson to go to war against her other grandson, Theudebert II of Austrasia, but when Theuderic assembled the army at Quierzy in 606, the men did not want to fight their fellow Franks: Protadius was promptly killed by the warriors, who forced the king to sign a treaty. In January 754 Pepin the Short received Pope Stephen II at Quierzy, and his decision was taken to adopt the Roman liturgy and Gregorian chant in his domains. The Donation of Pippin is alleged to have been made at Quierzy to Pope Stephen II, granting him the Exarchate of Ravenna. For his part the pope legitimized the Carolingians. Charlemagne confirmed this donation in 774, in Rome. Pepin spent the winter of 762 at Quierzy. Charlemagne convoked an assembly of the nobles here in January 775, in preparation of his invasion of Saxony. In 804 Pope Leo III met Charlemagne at Quierzy before proceeding to Aachen. In December 842 Charles the Bald married Ermentrude d'Orl√©ans at Quierzy. In the ninth century several councils of Quierzy debated contentious issues. At the synod of 853, the famous four decrees or chapters (capitula) drawn up by Hincmar, archbishop of Reims, on the questions of predestination were published, and Gottschalk condemned. The Capitulary of Quierzy was promulgated in June 877A former capitulary of Charles the Bald was promulgated at Quierzy on 14 February 857, and aimed especially at the repression of brigandage. by the emperor Charles the Bald, comprising a series of measures for safeguarding the administration of his realm during his second Italian expedition, as well as directions for his son Louis the Stammerer, who was entrusted with the government during his father's absence. A great concourse of lords was assembled to hear it read. In this document Charles took elaborate precautions against Louis the German, whom he had every reason to distrust. He forbids him to sojourn in certain palaces and in certain forests, and compels him to swear not to despoil his stepmother Richilde of her allodial lands and benefices. At the same time Charles refuses to allow Louis to nominate his candidates to the countships left vacant in the emperor's absence. The capitulary thus served as a guarantee to the aristocracy that the general usage would be followed in the existing circumstances, and also as a means of reassuring the counts who had accompanied the emperor into Italy as to the fate of their benefices. In the following century, however, Viking raids destroyed the palatium, and Hugh Capet gave his lands at Quierzy to the bishop of Noyon, who built a fortress to serve in confrontations with the powerful lords of Coucy. In ensuing centuries, the lands of Quierzy passed successively to the Ch√©risy, the Montmorency, the Roye, the Halluin, the Br√ªlart and Bussy-Rabutin families, until the French Revolution. Geography The town lies on the left bank of the river Oise, which flows westward through the commune. The river Ailette joins the Oise in the eastern part of the commune.

It is located in southern Indiana in Spencer County approximately east of Evansville. The park was established in 1932 and encompasses . There are of trails in the park. Many of the recreational facilities found within the park were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. In addition to the Sarah Lincoln Woods Nature Preserve, there are two lakes, campgrounds, group cottages, and cabins. The park provides access to many sites important to Abraham Lincoln during his childhood, including Abraham Lincoln's Boyhood Home; the Little Pigeon Creek Baptist Church and Cemetery, where his sister Sarah Lincoln Grigsby is buried; and the home of Colonel Jones a Civil War officer and merchant who employed Lincoln. Memorials were established to recognize Lincoln's mother Nancy Hanks Lincoln, whose gravesite is now contained within the adjacent Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial. There is also an interpretive center. Little Pigeon Baptist Church Little Pigeon Baptist Church Noah Gordon donated the land, about a mile and a half from the Lincoln farm, for a church in 1820. In 1821, Abraham Lincoln's father, Thomas Lincoln, was asked to oversee the construction of the Little Pigeon Baptist Church. Abraham, at age twelve, helped his father build the church. Thomas also constructed the cabinets and pulpit inside the church. The church, like other churches in the West, would not likely have had a college-trained minister. It was a Primitive Baptist or \\"Hard Shell Baptist\\" church. Thomas joined the church with his second wife, Sarah Bush Lincoln, on June 7, 1823, and five days later became a trustee. The church membership was generally limited to married adults. Thomas's daughter Sarah, for instance, was not made a member until 1826, shortly before her marriage. The Lincoln and Johnston children stayed at home when their parents went to church. Later, Abraham attended church. In 1825, the church decided to build a cemetery alongside the church. The church provided a means for a number of social gatherings for men and women. It was called the Old Pigeon Church after several families, including the Grigsbys, split off from the church in 1840 and built a new Little Pigeon Baptist Church farther south. They split off from the old church due to differences of opinion about Sunday school and mission work. The current structure is part of the state park and contains a cornerstone from the original church. Near the church is a small cemetery where the grave of Lincoln's sister, Sarah Lincoln Grigsby, is located. A congregation no longer worships there. Little Pigeon Creek Community map The Noah Gordon Mill Site Also within the park are the Noah Gordon home and mill sites. Noah Gordon was a neighbor of the Lincoln family and maintained a small grain mill. Abraham Lincoln spent many hours waiting his turn to mill grain here. Nine- year-old Abraham Lincoln was knocked unconscious for several hours after he was kicked in the head by a horse milling grain at Gordon's mill. The James Gentry Home Site Young Abraham Lincoln worked for James Gentry at his general store. The home site of James Gentry is located within Lincoln State Park off of trail 3. Abraham Lincoln took a flatboat trip to New Orleans, leaving from Rockport, to sell goods for Gentry. It was on this trip to New Orleans that Lincoln first witnessed slavery. The Col. William Jones Home The Colonel William Jones House The park also includes the restored Colonel William Jones House near Gentryville. Col. Jones was a merchant, farmer, politician, and Union Colonel during the American Civil War. The home was built around 1834 and the farm contained a general store where Abraham Lincoln was also employed. Born in Vincennes in 1803, Jones settled in Spencer County in 1828. Jones and his wife, Rachel, raised five sons on this farm. The home is open for tours, including a restored log barn. The home is located 1/4 mile west of Gentryville on Boone Street. Lincoln Amphitheater Within Lincoln State Park is the Lincoln Amphitheater. The amphitheater is a modern covered outdoor theater that was constructed in 1987 and began producing Young Abe Lincoln (written by Billy Edd Wheeler), that year. After being closed in 2005, Lincoln: Upon The Altar of Freedom premiered in June 2009 for the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth. The play returned for a second year in June 2010 and introduced the new \\"Concert in the Park\\" which features cast members singing some of the most popular songs and hymns during Lincoln's life following each nightly performance. In 2011 Lincoln: Upon The Altar of Freedom was rewritten into a musical renamed A. Lincoln: A Pioneer Tale. It recounts both Lincoln's childhood and major events in his presidency. It opened on June 8, 2012. It played its third season in 2014. A Pioneer Tale and The Lincoln Amphitheater went dark in 2015 for changes in management. In the 2016 season, The Indiana Department of Tourism operated the Amphitheater. A Pioneer Tale would play its 4th season that same year with many concerts taking place during the 2016 season. In 2017, The Actor's Community Theater of Jasper remounted a 30th- anniversary production of Young Abe Lincoln as part of the 2017 season. It was performed again in 2018 as an \\"Encore\\" Production. There is currently a new Lincoln drama in the works and will premiere in 2019.

He is regarded as one of the most important Shia Mujtahid at the time. He was a lecturer at Najaf seminary for years and significant number of students from \\"different regions of the Muslim world\\" used to participate his lectures. His most famous work is The Sufficiency (), where he gathered the jurispurdential ideas such as \\"continuity\\" and \\"presented them in a yet more rigorous fashion as a unified theory of jurisprudence\\". He is known for using his position as a marja for political use in the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1905‚Äì1911), where he was one of the main clerical supporters of the revolution. He believed that \\"constitutional form of government\\" would be the best possible choice in the absence of Imam and regarded the \\"Persian revolution\\" a Jihad (\\"holy war\\") in which all Muslims had to participate. He died \\"suddenly\\" and \\"mysteriously\\", when he aimed to leave Iraq for Iran in order against support constitutionalists' resistance to the Anglo-Russian invasion in 1911. Early life and education Khorasani was born in Mashhad, where he did his early educations. Then at 20, he left for Sabzevar, where he got familiar with Islamic philosophy under Molla Hadi Sabzavari. He continued Islamic philosophy under Molla Hosayn Kho æi at the Sadr seminary in Tehran, the city where he learnt Logic and Hekmat. In 1861 he moved to Iraq and in Najaf worked on complementary studies under Grand Ayatollah Mirza Hassan Shirazi, famous for his campaign against the tobacco concession. Also he studied about two years under Morteza Ansari. Both Morteza Ansari and Mirza Hassan Shirazi were marja-e taqlid (\\"models for emulation\\") at the time. Leader of Shia Muslims Shirazi's move Samarra provided a suitable opportunity for Akhund Khorasani to show his skill in feqh and osul in Najaf while being supported by Shirazi. After Shirazi's death he was recognized as a \\"a great religious leader\\". Some authors such as Ali Davani and Shahrestani regard him as the \\"sole marja-e taqlid immediately after Shirazi\\". He's also regarded as \\"an unquestionable master of osul al-feqh before Mohammad Fazel Sarabiani's death\\". He was a lecturer at Najaf seminary for years and significant number of students from \\"different regions of the Muslim world\\" used to participate his lectures. His most famous work is The Sufficiency (), which ranks \\"only after Morteza Ansari's treatice on commercial law\\" among the legal works written by mullahs in the last two centuries. In The Sufficiency, Khorasani gathered the jurispurdential ideas such as \\"continuity\\" and \\"presented them in a yet more rigorous fashion as a unified theory of jurisprudence\\". Khorasani was not a sayyed but \\"owed his position almost purely to his intellectual accomplishments\\". Under Khorasani's leadership, the Usuli position became the dominant view. Views Although he warned the scholars for not involving in political activities as he believed that they had other responsibilities, he believed that scholars could act as \\"warning voices in society\\" and criticize the officials who were not doing their responsibilities correctly. He compared the role of scholars with \\"salt of the earth\\" in the sense that they prevent \\"decay of power\\", should fight against injustice and that they are against \\"autocratic attitudes\\". Political activities The first known Akhund Khorasani's anti-government political activities is related to \\"the unrest following the two Russian loans to Mozaffar-al-din Shah\\". Mohammad Kazem Khorasani was also one of the main clerical supporters of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution and along with Mirza Hosayn Tehrani and Shaikh Abdallah Mazandarani he led people against what they called a \\"state tyranny\\" and issued fatwas and \\"sent telegrams to tribal chiefs, prominent national and political leaders, and heads of state in England, France, Germany, and Turkey\\". When Mohammad Ali Shah became king of Iran, Mohammad Kazem Khorasani sent him a \\"ten-point\\" instruction including points on ptotecting Islam, promoting domestic industries and modern science, stopping foreign powers' intervention in Iran \\"while retaining diplomatic relations\\", and establishing \\"justice and equality\\". He believed that \\"constitutional form of government\\" would be the best possible choice in the absence of Imam and regarded the \\"Persian revolution\\" a Jihad (\\"holy war\\") in which all Muslims had to participate. When Sheikh Fazlollah Noori declared journalists non-Muslims for their support of the new Constitutional Assembly, Khorasani retaliated by announcing that Sheikh Fazlollah was himself no longer a Muslim, leading to Fazlollah's execution. The reaction to Noori's execution in Najaf harmed Khorasani and other constitution supporters and led to a rivalry with Mohammed Kazem Yazdi. Khorsani acted more intensively against Mohammad Ali Shah when he shelled the parliament building and executed many \\"constitutionalists\\". He apparently did not have ties with Oudh Bequest nor he favored British, despite the allegations. He were in an \\"equal opposition\\" to Russia and Britain, two powers at the time. Works and pupils He authored many books hence titled \\"The Renewer\\" (al-mujaddid) of Usul al-feqh. Kifayat al-usul, Khorasani's most important book, is taught in advanced classes at the seminaries as the main text on the methodology of law. It has received \\"hundreds of commentaries\\". The book suppressed Qvanin al-Osul by Qummi, one of seminary main texts taught at sotuh level. Also, he wrote one of the most important commentaries on Shaykh Morteza al-Ansari's Durar al-fawaid fi sharh al-Faraid, also taught alongside Kifayat al-usul. His students: 1\\\\.

As a child and youth he was noted for his love of charity, exercised especially towards pilgrims, the sick in hospitals, and prisoners.

In 1260 he was one of the band of missionaries who evangelized Hungary. Six years later Sienna was put under an interdict for having espoused the cause of the Emperor Frederick II, then at enmity with the Holy See. The Siennese petitioned Ambrose to plead their cause before the Sovereign Pontiff, and so successfully did he do this that he obtained for his native city full pardon and a renewal of all her privileges. The Siennese soon cast off their allegiance; a second time Ambrose obtained pardon for them. He brought about a reconciliation between King Conradin of Germany and Pope Clement IV. Around this time he was chosen bishop of his native city, but he declined the office. For a time, he devoted himself to preaching the Eighth Crusade; and later, at the request of Pope Gregory X, caused the studies which the late wars had practically suspended to be resumed in the Dominican convent at Rome. After the death of Pope Gregory X, he retired to one of the convents of his order, whence he was summoned by Innocent V and sent as papal legate to Tuscany. He restored peace there between Florence and Pisa and also between the dogal republics of Venice and Genoa, another pair of commercial rivals within Italy. He died at Sienna, in 1286. His name was inserted in the Roman Martyrology in 1577. His biographers exhibit his life as one of perfect humility. He loved poetry, and many legends are told of victories over carnal temptations. He was a renowned preacher. His oratory, simple rather than elegant, was most convincing and effective. His sermons, although once collected, are not extant.

She became known in the security community after the Black Hat Briefings conference in Las Vegas in August 2006, where Rutkowska presented an attack against Vista kernel protection mechanism, and also a technique dubbed Blue Pill, that used hardware virtualization to move a running OS into a virtual machine. Subsequently, she has been named one of Five Hackers who Put a Mark on 2006 by eWeek Magazine for her research on the topic. The original concept of Blue Pill was published by another researcher at IEEE Oakland on May 2006 under the name VMBR. During the following years, Rutkowska continued to focus on low- level security. In 2007 she demonstrated that certain types of hardware-based memory acquisition (e.g. FireWire based) are unreliable and can be defeated. Later in 2007, together with a team member Alexander Tereshkin, presented further research on virtualization malware. In 2008, Rutkowska with her team focused on Xen hypervisor security. In 2009, together with a team member Rafal Wojtczuk, presented an attack against Intel Trusted Execution Technology and Intel System Management Mode.Attacking Intel Trusted Execution Technology In April 2007, Rutkowska founded Invisible Things Lab in Warsaw, Poland. The company focuses on OS and VMM security research and provides various consulting services. In a 2009 blog post she coined the term \\"evil maid attack\\", detailing a method for accessing encrypted data on disk by compromising the firmware via an external USB flash drive. In 2010, she and Rafal Wojtczuk began working on the Qubes OS security-oriented desktop Xen distribution, which utilizes Fedora Linux. The initial release of Qubes 1.0 was completed by September 3, 2012 and is available as a free download. Its main concept is \\"security by compartmentalization\\", using domains implemented as lightweight Xen virtual machines to isolate various subsystems. Each compartment is referred to as a Qube, which operates as a separate hardware level virtual machine. The project refers to itself as \\"a reasonably secure operating system\\" and has received endorsements by numerous privacy and security experts. It is fairly unique in its capabilities, having a design informed by research on proven vulnerabilities in the trusted compute base (TCB), that are unaddressed in most common desktop operating systems. She has published seminal works on systems trustability, most recently Intel x86 Considered Harmful and State Considered Harmful - A Proposal for a Stateless Laptop. Rutkowska has been invited as an esteemed presenter at security conferences, such as Chaos Communication Congress, Black Hat Briefings, HITB, RSA Conference, RISK, EuSecWest & Gartner IT Security Summit.

After graduating from Tsinghua University in 1935, he entered its Graduate School and became an intern researcher at the National Central Research Institute under the guidance of Wu Youxun. He obtained a Ph.D. degree at the University of Toronto under the supervision of John Lighton Synge in 1942, and then worked as a research associate in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of Caltech. In 1946, Qian returned to China and served as professor of Tsinghua University, Peking University and Yanjing University. In 1950s, he was Dean of Studies and Vice President of Tsinghua University, Vice Director of the Institute of Mechanics of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Director of the Institute of Automation of CAS, and a member of the Standing Committee of All China Federation of Scientific Societies. He was elected a founding academician of the CAS in 1955 and a foreign academician of the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1956. During the Anti-Rightist Movement, he was denounced as a \\"rightist.\\" In 1982, Qian became President of Shanghai University of Technology, which had been turned into a shambles after the consolidation of 4 institutions of higher education in 1994. Qian was Editor-in-Chief of \\"Applied Mathematics and Mechanics\\", a member of the Editorial Boards of \\"International Journal of Engineering Science\\"(US), \\"Advances in Applied Mechanics\\"(US), \\"Journal of Thin-walled Structure\\"(Holland) and \\"Journal of Finite Elements in Analysis and Design\\". He had been Vice Chairman of the National Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference since 1987. Qian was a specialist in applied mathematics, mechanics, physics, engineering science and Chinese information processing. He was generally acknowledged as one of the pioneers and founders of modern mechanics undertakings in China. His major research activities include; the intrinsic theory of plates and shells, the analysis of large deflection of thin plates and shells, the analysis of corrugated pipes, mechanics of armour penetration, singular perturbation methods, variational principles and generalized variational principles, finite element methods as well as the measurements of atmospheric electricity, spectral analysis of rare-earth elements, wave guide theory, lubrication theory, the development of high-energy batteries, his macro-coding of Chinese characters, etc. The joint work with J. L. Synge on the intrinsic theory of plates and shells is considered as a pioneering classical work in solid mechanics and his successive approximation method of treating large deflection problem is now named as \\"Chien's method\\". And he initiated a novel singular perturbation method, the method of composite expansions. He had published in academic monographs and hundreds of scientific papers. Due to his work on the problems of large deflation of circular elastic plates and the generalized variational principles, he won the State Natural Science Award (Second Class) twice, in 1965 and 1982. He also made great contribution to the engineering applications of sciences, such as the fluttering of airplanes, the design of submarines, armour penetration, the design of instruments and panpipe systems. In the early 1980s, Qian worked with Zhou Youguang and Liu Zunqi on creating a Chinese-language edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. During his presidency of Shanghai University (formerly Shanghai University of Technology), he devoted himself to the reconstruction of the University and to the accomplishment of reforms in higher education . He believed that the key role of higher education is to bring up excellent new generations with prefect personality and advanced expertise. For this purpose, he laid emphasis on raising the academic level of the University and shows great concerns to the publication of academic journals at the University.

He was on the staff of the Japanese delegation to the Washington Disarmament Conference in 1921. On his return to Japan, he served in a number of administrative positions within the Imperial Army General Staff Office, including a stint from 1923 to 1924 when he was stationed in Hankou, China. Promoted to colonel in the infantry in 1924, he was given command of the IJA 30th Infantry Regiment.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II Tashiro became Vice Chief of the 5th Section (Asian Intelligence), 2nd Bureau within the General Staff in 1926, and was considered an expert on China.

American Motors designed some of its engines; others were inherited from its constituents. The company bought other engines or engine designs from other manufacturers. Four cylinder engines American Motors used several four- cylinder engine designs. Air-cooled 108 The is an AMC designed air- cooled V4 engine that was used in AMC's lightweight aluminium-bodied M422 'Mighty Mite' military vehicle, built from January 1960 to January 1963 as an air transportable (by the helicopters of the time) Jeep for the U.S. Marine Corps. This engine was unsuitable for regular passenger car use mainly due to its relatively small displacement and power output. * Bore and stroke: * Compression: 7.5:1 * Horsepower: @ 3,600 rpm * Torque: @ 2,500 rpm Audi/VW 121 The was an advanced design overhead camshaft four-cylinder EA831 engine bought from Audi/Volkswagen 1977 through 1979. Though a small engine, its advanced design created reasonable power for its size and due to being an OHC engine, it had a high redline. This engine was also used in the Audi 100, Volkswagen LT van, and Porsche 924. The engine was assembled to AMC specs in the US at a specifically purchased AMC assembly plant. Specifications are different from the Audi/VW/Porsche assembled engine. AMC used a carburetor and standard points ignition as well as slightly larger clearances. The original agreement was for AMC to buy the design, eventually moving manufacturing to the United States and selling the engines back to VW and Audi. American Motors bought a plant specifically to build the engine, but never sold enough to move complete manufacturing. The AMC engines were assembled in the U.S. from major castings supplied by VW, hence the different assembly clearances. As part of the agreement, AMC was not to use the VW or Audi names when referring to the engine. Everyone familiar with the design knew they were virtually identical, and the automotive press commonly referred to them as Audi or VW engines. VW/Audi/Porsche U.S. spec engines produced in mid-1977; earlier models produced -- more than the AMC version. * Bore √ó stroke 3.41\\" √ó 3.32\\" * Compression ratio 8.1:1 * Horsepower (net) @ 5,000 rpm * Torque (net) @ 2,800 rpm It was used in the AMC Gremlin, AMC Spirit, and AMC Concord, The only Jeep this engine was used in was the 1979 Jeep DJ (Dispatcher or Postal Delivery). In the DJ5G, it was mated only to a 3-speed A904 automatic transmission with a VW/Audi pattern bellhousing. In AMC passenger cars with manual transmission, this engine was mated to a BorgWarner HR-1 4-speed transmission. Passenger cars with automatic also used the A904. It shares the bellhousing pattern with several German cars (Audi 5-cylinder inline), although it does not share the bellhousing pattern with the VW Rabbit diesel line of engines.  Renault 126 turbodiesel  The Renault-developed 4-cylinder turbodiesel was an optional engine used in AMC's Jeep line between 1984 and 1986. It was mated to a standard four-speed or optional five-speed manual, and with either transmission delivered exceptional fuel economy. For a diesel of this size at that time, power delivery was respectable, at at 3,750 rpm, at 2,750 rpm. The engine was also known for relatively instant pedal response at a time when both diesel- and turbocharger-equipped engines generally were known for a noticeable lag. Weighing in at only , it also featured first-tier technology for the time such as an intercooler and an overhead cam. When it reached the market, it marked the first time a turbocharged diesel was offered in a sports-utility vehicle in the United States.  Pontiac 151  The is commonly referred to as the \\"Iron Duke\\" and is a Pontiac design. It was purchased by AMC from 1979 through 1983 as the base option in the RWD Spirit and Concord, the 4WD Eagle models, economy versions of Jeep CJs, and in postal Jeeps. This early version used a Chevrolet small block V8 bell housing bolt pattern. The 1984 and later model GM 151s used the corporate GM four- cylinder/small V6 bolt pattern (not used by AMC). * Bore √ó Stroke 4.00\\" √ó 3.00\\" * Compression Ratio 8.2:1 * Horsepower (net) @ 4,000 rpm * Torque (net) @ 2,600 rpm AMC 150 In 1984 AMC introduced its own four-cylinder engine design. All previous fours (with the exception of the Air-Cooled 108) were purchased for interim use. The AMC four was only used in Jeep and Eagle vehicles since all other AMC passenger cars ceased production in 1983. Six- cylinder engines=Nash and Hudson beginnings When Nash and Hudson merged to form AMC in 1954 all the Hudson bodies were dropped for the 1955 model year. The Ambassador and Statesman received a hasty grille/taillight/trim/dash restyling to create the new Hudson Hornet and Wasp. The Nash Ambassador Six retained the Nash OHV six for 1955 and 1956, V8 only for 1957. The Nash OHV six, dating back to 1934, was a totally different design than the Rambler 195.6. Hudson six-cylinder cars retained the Hudson L-head six, in the Hornet and in the Wasp. This was the only major Hudson component left - it dated back to the 1940s. All Rambler models, whether badged Hudson or Nash, used the Rambler OHV six. This design dates back to 1940, when it was introduced in the Nash 600 as an L-head engine. Displacement was increased over the years to , and finally to 195.6 in the early-1950s. The block casting was changed to allow an OHV head for the 1956 Rambler (the L-head was discontinued). Rambler 195.6 This motor was originally a Nash design dating back to 1940. AMC used an L-head (flat-head, 1955, 1958‚Äì65) and OHV (1956‚Äì1965) version, as well as an aluminum block version (1961‚Äì1963). All shared the same bore and stroke as well as some other features/components. For more information see AMC Straight-6 engine. Kaiser 230 American Motors neither designed the Tornado 230 nor used it in a domestic AMC-branded vehicle. Subsidiary Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA) produced this engine in Argentina after the 1970 merger and used it in a variety of vehicles. In the United States, this engine is often confused with the AMC/Jeep , which Kaiser Jeep purchased to replace the SOHC Kaiser engine in 1965. The Tornado first appeared in civilian Jeep vehicles in 1963 and was only used until 1965. The US Army M-715 and derivatives used it through the 1960s and early 1970s. The AMC and Kaiser engines do not share bellhousing bolt patterns. Cam trouble on the 230 was common due to inadequate oil formulations of the time. Its under- square bore and stroke endeared the engine for low-speed torque. It was a dependable engine with reports of them going 250,000 mi. with no major problems‚Äîwith proper maintenance. Production continued through 1983 in Argentina where AMC used it in passenger cars and Kaiser in Jeeps. Buick 225 Kaiser introduced the \\"Dauntless\\" V6 engine in the 1966 CJ and as an option in the C101 Jeepster Commando. Kaiser bought the tooling from Buick to build the 225 during the short period prior to selling its Jeep subsidiary to AMC. American Motors retained the Buick engine briefly after it bought Jeep. The engine was retired in 1971 shortly after AMC acquired Kaiser in 1970. American Motors sold the tooling back to General Motors in 1974. The engine was an odd-fire V6, meaning that TDC for the cylinders was not evenly spaced around the engine but grouped in pairs. The engines in Jeeps featured a heavier flywheel than the Buick version to help dampen vibrations resulting from the engine's firing pattern. The engine was known at the time for its power and reliability. It would idle slowly, but not as smooth as other engines, especially the inline sixes. This engine was used in the following vehicles: * Jeep CJ-5 * Jeep CJ-6 * C101 Jeepster Commando * various small Buicks from 1960 to 1964 The Modern Era I-6 American Motors designed an entirely new six-cylinder engine for 1964 and introduced the 232 in the new Classic Hardtop as the Typhoon. In 1965 AMC introduced the more economical 199 in the Rambler American. In the 1970s, VAM (See Veh√≠culos Automotores Mexicanos) introduced a 282-cubic-inch version of the engine. American Motors and Chrysler produced the basic design constantly through 2006 (AMC was bought out by Chrysler in late 1987). See AMC Straight-6 engine. : : : : The early engines' bell pattern differed from AMC V8s. In 1971 AMC raised the block height and lengthened the stroke on the 199 and early 232 engines. The 199 became 232 cubic inches and the 232 became 258. These two RB or \\"raised block\\" engines shared the small bell pattern of the earlier engines for only the 1971 model year. In 1972 both the 232 as well as the 258 changed bell pattern to match AMC V8s, in conjunction with AMC's switch from Borg-Warner to Chrysler- built automatic transmissions. General Motors V6 : GM 60-Degree LR2 V6 engine This engine was used in: * 1984‚Äì1986 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) * numerous GM vehicles V8 Engines American Motors purchased V8 engines from Packard before introducing its in-house-designed V8. The automaker used these Packard engines exclusively in 1955 and 1956 Nash Ambassadors and Hudson Hornets. The Packard engine was used in 1955, and switched to the version for the 1956 model year. All Packard V8 powered AMCs came with Packard's Ultramatic automatic transmission. Late in 1956, AMC introduced its own V8 design in a version and used it only in the Ambassador and Hornet Special models. The Specials were actually the slightly smaller and lighter Statesman/Wasp two- door hardtop bodies with Ambassador/Hornet trim. The Packard engines were dropped after 1956 in favor of the AMC-developed-and-built V8s. This was AMC's first V8 engine design and became known as the Rambler V8 as they made their transformation from Nash and Hudson into Rambler, heralding Rambler products as an official division of American Motors Corporation. At 601 lbs, as officially declared by AMC, the Rambler V8 weighs only 26 lbs. more than Chevrolet's small block generic weight of 575 lbs, but its target competitor's offerings typically weighed much more, such as the largest Studebaker 289 V8 weighing in around 675 lbs. AMC introduced their new '57 CID version in the Rambler Rebel, which gave it an advantageous power to weight ratio whereby it may be considered as one of the first muscle cars. All '56-'66 AMC Rambler V8 engines feature a 10\\" deck height, which by Ford standards, is the dividing line between 'small blocks' and 'big blocks', so the typical 'other make' automotive jargon does not add any useful description. All '66-'91 AMC V8s have the same 4.75\\" bore spacing as the Rambler V8 and the same crankshaft to camshaft centerline distance but this second AMC V8 design weighs less for a variety of technical reasons. The '66-'91 AMC V8's generic engine weight is 540 lbs. The AMC V8 continued to be manufactured after Chrysler bought out American Motors in 1987, and was the only engine available in the Jeep Grand Wagoneer through the 1991 model year.

The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical normal distribution or \\"bell curve\\". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called \\"innovators\\", followed by \\"early adopters\\". Next come the early majority and late majority, and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called \\"Laggards\\" or \\"phobics.\\" For example, a phobic may only use a cloud service when it is the only remaining method of performing a required task, but the phobic may not have an in-depth technical knowledge of how to use the service. The demographic and psychological (or \\"psychographic\\") profiles of each adoption group were originally specified by the North Central Rural Sociology Committee, Subcommittee for the Study of the Diffusion of Farm Practices, by agricultural researchers Beal and Bohlen in 1957. The report summarized the categories as: * innovators ‚Äì had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented * early adopters ‚Äì younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous * early majority ‚Äì more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbours * late majority ‚Äì older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active * laggards ‚Äì very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated The model has subsequently been adapted for many areas of technology adoption in the late 20th century. Adaptations of the model The model has spawned a range of adaptations that extend the concept or apply it to specific domains of interest. In his book Crossing the Chasm, Geoffrey Moore proposes a variation of the original lifecycle. He suggests that for discontinuous innovations, which may result in a Foster disruption based on s-curve, there is a gap or chasm between the first two adopter groups (innovators/early adopters), and the vertical markets. Disruption as it is used today are of the Clayton M. Christensen variety. These disruptions are not s-curve based. In educational technology, Lindy McKeown has provided a similar model (a pencil metaphorPencil metaphor ) describing the ICT uptake in education. In medical sociology, Carl May has proposed normalization process theory that shows how technologies become embedded and integrated in health care and other kinds of organisation. Wenger, White and Smith, in their book Digital habitats: Stewarding technology for communities, talk of technology stewards: people with sufficient understanding of the technology available and the technological needs of a community to steward the community through the technology adoption process. Rayna and Striukova (2009) propose that the choice of initial market segment has crucial importance for crossing the chasm, as adoption in this segment can lead to a cascade of adoption in the other segments. This initial market segment has, at the same time, to contain a large proportion of visionaries, to be small enough for adoption to be observed from within the segment and from other segment and be sufficiently connected with other segments. If this is the case, the adoption in the first segment will progressively cascade into the adjacent segments, thereby triggering the adoption by the mass-market.Rayna, Thierry, Striukova, Ludmila and Landau, Samuel, Crossing the Chasm or Being Crossed Out: The Case of Digital Audio Players (March 7, 2009). International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 36-54, July‚ÄìSeptember 2009. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392691 Stephen L. Parente (1995) implemented a Markov Chain to model economic growth across different countries given different technological barriers. Examples One way to model product adoptionVon Ahn, Luis. (2008) Science of the Web lectures at Carnegie Mellon University. is to understand that people's behaviours are influenced by their peers and how widespread they think a particular action is. For many format-dependent technologies, people have a non-zero payoff for adopting the same technology as their closest friends or colleagues. If two users both adopt product A, they might get a payoff a > 0; if they adopt product B, they get b > 0\\\\. But if one adopts A and the other adopts B, they both get a payoff of 0\\\\. A threshold can be set for each user to adopt a product. Say that a node v in a graph has d neighbors: then v will adopt product A if a fraction p of its neighbors is greater than or equal to some threshold. For example, if v's threshold is 2/3, and only one of its two neighbors adopts product A, then v will not adopt A. Using this model, we can deterministically model product adoption on sample networks. History The technology adoption lifecycle is a sociological model that is an extension of an earlier model called the diffusion process, which was originally published in 1957 by Joe M. Bohlen, George M. Beal and Everett M. Rogers at Iowa State University and which was originally published only for its application to agriculture and home economics. building on earlier research conducted there by Neal C.

To this end, the smash cut usually occurs at a crucial moment in a scene where a cut would not be expected. To heighten the impact of the cut, a disparity in the type of scene on either side of the cut is often present, going from a fast-paced frenzied scene to a tranquil one, or going from a pleasant scene to a tense one, for example. For example, a smash cut could be used in a murder scene: the killer brings a knife plunging down into his victim, and just before the blade pierces the skin, the scene is suddenly replaced with a non- violent use of a cutting edge, such as the chopping of vegetables. Smash cuts are often used when a character wakes up from a nightmare to simulate the jarring nature of that experience. Smash cutting can also be used to comedic effect: for example, directly after a prediction is made, cutting to the future showing the prediction to have been humorously, and often outlandishly, wrong. One specific variety of smash cut, which depicts a given character resolutely declaring his or her intentions immediately before a cut to a scene depicting the character doing the exact opposite, is known in the United States as a Gilligan cut, so named for the TV show Gilligan's Island, and elsewhere known as a bicycle cut, so named for a scene from Last of the Summer Wine.

Baptised Emma Weeden, January 1815 at St George Hanover Square, London, England, a daughter of William and Sarah Weeden. The Weeden family included Emma's brother William, and her two sisters Jemima Thomasina and Sarah. Their father was groom and stable master for Other Archer Windsor, the Earl of Plymouth. They grew up on the Windsor estates in Leicester and Tardebigge, Worchester, receiving a good education and becoming proficient with horses. Following the death of The Earl of Plymouth in 1833 the Weeden's returned to London where William became the proprietor of a fast coach service between London and Brighton. Emma Weeden married Robert Fullerton at Brighton on 2 February 1839, at which time she was already describing herself as a \\"Proprietor of Music\\". Her husband died and on 6 December 1850 Emma had a son to a visiting American Theatrical actor who went by the stage name Daniel Waller. His real name was Daniel Waller Wilmarth. Their son was named Henry Tuthill Waller Wilmarth. Emma had been pursuing her music career under the stage name \\"Miss Eardley\\" (her mother's maiden name). A favorable review appears in the Berkshire Chronicle of 24 November 1849. She soon progressed to being a regular performer at Madame Vestris‚Äô Royal Lyceum Theatre in London. The Lyceum was known for extravaganzas featuring the peculiarities of burlesque and something of the pantomime, mixed up with a dash of seriousness, and not a little satirical humour. Emma and Daniel married on 29 April 1851 in St Marks, Old Street, Middlesex. Daniel and Emma Waller travelled to the United States in 1851. Daniel played Hamlet and other tragic roles in New York soon after their arrival. Emma's American stage d√©but was as lead in a grand concert at the Jenny Lind Theatre, San Francisco, on 6 May 1852. She was received well and became a popular performer. For much of 1852 The Waller Troupe, which included a young Edwin Booth, toured the northern Californian mining towns on horseback. They sailed thence for Australia, where at Melbourne Mrs. Waller acted Lady Macbeth. Returning to London, Mrs. Waller made her d√©but at the Drury Lane on 15 September 1856, as Pauline in Bulwer- Lytton's The Lady of Lyons. In the diaries of E. L. Blanchard he notes that \\"as Pauline‚Äîshe lacked vigour, but was gentle and graceful\\" (Scott and Howard, post, I, 164). If his judgment is correct, she must have grown appreciably in physical and intellectual intensity, for she became one of the leading emotional actresses on the American stage. Towards the end of 1857 the Wallers returned to the United States, where they thereafter remained. Mrs. Waller made her d√©but at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia on 19 October 1857, as Ophelia to the Hamlet of Mr. Waller. On the second and third nights of that engagement she acted successively Pauline and Lady Macbeth. She was described as \\"of stately presence, neither slender nor stout in person, and had an interesting and expressive face\\" (New York Dramatic Mirror, post, p. 17). The same spectator adds that she acted Lady Macbeth with an \\"intensity of . . . passion\\" that was \\"almost painful.\\" Her first appearance in New York was on 5 April 1858, as Marina to her husband's Ferdinand in a new version of John Webster's tragedy, The Duchess of Malfi. Thereafter she starred for some twenty years throughout the country, often with Mr. Waller as her principal associate. Among her most conspicuous characters being Queen Margaret in Richard III and Queen Katharine in Henry VIII (both in support of Edwin Booth), Meg Merrilies in Guy Mannering, Nelly Brady in Edmund Falconer's The Peep O‚ÄôDay, and Julia in Sheridan Knowles's The Hunchback. Though Mrs. Waller was accused of imitating the Meg Merrilies of Charlotte Cushman, she had never seen her in the part, and her Meg was an original assumption of that character. \\"The weird dignity of her bearing,\\" wrote William Winter, \\"was impressive beyond words ; there were moments, indeed, when she seemed to be a soul inspired by communion with beings of another world\\" (post, p. 196). She was also one of a number of actresses who seemed to take pleasure in impersonating male Shakespearean characters, among the most noteworthy of these being her interpretations of Hamlet and Iago. She closed her career as an actress in 1878 as Hester Stanhope in a modern play entitled An Open Verdict. Afterwards, like many other actors and actresses, she gave public readings from Shakespeare and other dramatists, her last noteworthy public appearance being made at Chickering Hall in New York on 1 December 1881. Mr. Waller died in 1882 and for some years thereafter she taught elocution in New York. Ill health finally compelled her to abandon all active professional work, and she lived in complete retirement at the home of her son in New York, where she died.

Woodchurch is a Kent village, the largest civil parish in the Borough of Ashford. It is centred from the market town of Ashford and from the Cinque Ports town of Tenterden, in Kent, South East England. The windmill that overlooks the village from the north commands extensive views over the Walland marshes to the English Channel coast. It is a fine example of a Kentish smock mill and was originally one of a pair of windmills standing on this site, known locally as The Twins.Woodchurch Windmill The mill is open throughout the summer and is accessible via a footpath that passes between the village pubs. The village is on the edge of the Weald of Kent, whilst the parish extends north to south and east to west, one of Kent's largest. Within the village are the settlements of Brattle and Townland Green. To the south-west is the flat expanse of Shirley Moor leading to Romney Marsh and the low wooded hills overlooking Appledore and the Marsh are to the south-east. The surrounding area is designated as a Kent Special Landscape Area.Woodchurch Parish Council Institutions & village life The village became firmly established in the 13th century with the erection of the large All Saints church made of Kentish ragstone. Although it was extensively restored in the 1840s, it still boasts a 13th-century chancel and a famous brass of the 14th century, depicting a floriated cross design. It has an unusual four-faced clock and a spire which is out of the vertical at the top. The church has a peal of 6 bells, with its tenor bell weighing 3/4 ton. Several of the bells were cast at the Whitechapel foundry in London. The bells are rung from an oak framed platform at the tower end. The ringing can be seen from the main church through a large glazed partition. The tower is unusual as it houses four clock faces, an expensive addition at the time of installation, allowing the clock to be seen throughout the village. Much early history of Woodchurch is described by the historian Edward Hasted in his The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent.Edward Hasted, Parishes: Woodchurch, in The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 7 (Canterbury, 1798), pp. 226-237. British History Online [accessed 18 December 2019]. The village primary school is situated near the church and was a National school. The first building was erected in 1844 and the school has since been enlarged on four occasions, namely, in 1872, 1896, 1990 and most recently in 1998. Originally the main old building was significantly smaller than today and was later extended. The main hall was added in the early nineties, under headmaster Alan Green. Temporary \\"mobile complexes\\" were added, removed and replaced with permanent structures over the years to accommodate the school's increasing roll. The village green in the centre of the village is a focal point for the community. It is home to the village football and cricket clubs; which have use of a permanent pavilion on the greenside; as well as a modern children's playground. Alongside the green is the Village Memorial Hall and Annexe, as well as Tennis courts. Plans are currently being considered and funds raised for a replacement Hall. The Hall has a fully functional proscenium theatre space, which is home to the village's PlayersWoodchurch Players organisation, who put on three productions every year. The village also has a community centre on Lower Road. This centre was originally built to replace the original Scout hall on George's Hill which was dilapidated and dangerous. It is now home to Scouts, Guides and other community organisation, as well as being for hire.http://www.woodchurchcommunitycentre.co.uk/index.php Woodchurch also boasts the Woodchurch Village Life Museum located on Susan's Hillhttp://www.woodchurchmuseum.com and the South of England Rare Breeds Centre is located a mile out of the village on the Hamstreet road (B2067).http://www.rarebreeds.org.uk/ The village also has its own Morris dancing side, Woodchurch Morris Men, who started dancing together in 1990 to perpetuate the ancient tradition and have many stands throughout the year. Historically the village has been home to three public houses. The Bonny Cravat and Six Bells opposite the church in the main village, and The Stonebridge Inn serving the Brattle area at the other end of the village. The Bonny Cravat is a managed Shepherd Neame pub and The Six Bells is a free house. The Stonebridge Inn closed in the early 2000s and has now been demolished to make way for a large newbuild carehome.

He went to the Cape in 1819 and was sent to Natal in 1842, where he participated in the siege of Congela. Four years later he was appointed magistrate of the Transoranje and bought the farm Bloemfontein where he and his family settled. The town later became the City of Bloemfontein. Family Roots Tradition dictates that Major Warden was the grandson of an illegitimate son of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, the so-called Young Pretender. His father, Captain Charles Frederick (Stuart) Warden (1746 - circa 1815) changed the family name to Warden for reasons generally accepted to suggest the decision was made to escape religious persecution. Wardens's mother, Mary Cooper was the daughter of a rich weaver. Charles Frederick was a Captain in the Buffs Regiment, stationed at the Tower of London, in which he was buried in 1815. They had 3 sons, and after Charles Frederick's death in 1815, the Duke of York a relative of Mary Cooper supposedly organised employment for them. Charles Frederick (jnr) first went to India in Civil service and later became a rich merchant in Woolwich, George Horatio became a ship's doctor, and the 19 year old Henry Douglas went to the Cape where he obtained a commission in the Cape Corps. On his arrival at Cape Town in 1820 Major Warden joined the Cape Corps as a standard-bearer. By 1825 he became a Lieutenant and during 1835, after displaying extraordinary courage in the sixth Frontier War, he was promoted to Captain of the Cape Mounted Riflemen. He then built Fort Warden at the Great Kei Way, 7km south-east of the confluence of the Kei and the Komgha Rivers. In 1826 he was instructed to cross the Orange River and 20 years later he was appointed British Resident in the territory of the Griqua captain Adam Kok to maintain law and order. Major Warden (D/N 1856 6/9/76 4196) founded the town of Bloemfontein in 1846 on the farm Bloemfontein which he had bought from Dolf Britz at ¬£37,10s. In 1848 Andries Pretorius forced Warden to leave Bloemfontein. But in the same year after the battle of Boomplaats he returned as British Resident of the Orange River Sovereignty. From 1848 to 1852 he laid the foundations of an administration which was later to become a model republic. After the death of his first wife (Antoinette Hugo, by whom he had one son, Henry Douglas jnr), Major Warden married Susanna Elizabeth Minnaar (30/10/1815 Grahamstown - 4/10/1890 Smithfield, D/N OFS M578) ) on 5/7/1834 in Grahamstown. They had 10 children: 1. Charles Frederick +1900 in a Durban concentration camp, Magistrate of Harrismith, the town Warden was named after him, x Johanna Agnes Adam. They had no children but brought up one of George Horatio's sons William Gustavus. 2.

Farmer Mount Margaret, Ladybrand and his wife's names were Margaret Susanna. Major Warden's children were educated in an Afrikaans community and played a very important part in building up the Orange Free State. His son Charles later became the magistrate of Harri-smith. Three well-known streets in Bloemfontein, namely Charles Street, Henry Street and Eliza-beth Street bear the names of his children up to this day (named after the Royal House of Stuart). Warden sold his farm Douglas Valley outside Bloemfontein after the Declaration of Inde-pendence of the Orange Free State in 1854. After his retirement he lived at George where he died of pneumonia in 1856.

He is the owner of the Shafrazi Art Gallery in New York City, who deals artwork by artists such as Francis Bacon, Keith Haring, and David LaChapelle. Early life and education Shafrazi was born in Abadan, Iran to Iranian Armenian parents and raised Christian. His parents divorced when he was two years old. At the age of 13, his father, an oil-company executive, and his stepmother took Shafrazi to England and left him to study there.David Grogan (March 26, 1984), Once He Vandalized Picasso's Guernica, but Now Tony Shafrazi Is a Successful Patron of the Arts People. He first went to a vicarage in Bilston, then to boarding school in Whittlebury, and later Hammersmith College of Art & Building. He attended the Royal College of Art from 1963 to 1967. While attending Royal College of Art, Shafrazi visited New York City in 1965, staying in a YMCA that was near Andy Warhol‚Äôs Factory. On that trip he met Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and art dealer Leo Castelli. He moved to New York City in 1969,Carol Vogel (October 12, 1998), Another Look at Bacon; Newfound Canvases Shed More Light on a Master New York Times. where he lectured at several universities, including the School of Visual Arts.  Art work = Shafrazi and Guernica On February 28, 1974, Shafrazi spray- painted Picasso's 1937 painting Guernica, which hung in the Museum of Modern Art, with the words \\"KILL LIES ALL\\" in foot-high letters. He had meant to write, \\"ALL LIES KILL\\", as a response to James Joyce‚Äôs novel, Finnegans Wake. When a guard finally grabbed him, Shafrazi shouted, \\"Call the curator. I am an artist.\\" The paint was easily removed as the painting was heavily varnished. It is believed that Shafrazi was protesting the announcement, the day before, of the release on bail of U.S. lieutenant William Calley. Calley, then under house arrest following his conviction, in 1971, for his part in the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, had petitioned for habeas corpus; he had initially been sentenced to life imprisonment. Although his appeal was overturned in June, he was finally released from U.S. Army custody later in the year after having received a limited pardon from Richard Nixon. Shafrazi was a member of the Art Workers' Coalition, which in 1970 had staged a protest at MoMA by unfurling a copy of the famous My Lai protest poster And babies in front of the Guernica painting, which itself depicts the tragedies of war and the suffering it inflicts upon innocent civilians. Shafrazi was later given five years' probation, without a trial.  Art Basel 2012  Shafrazi dedicated his booth at Art Basel 2012 to his own artwork and caused a stir. After nine hours, he added other artists to his booth. Art dealer In 1976, only a few years after the spray painting incident, Shafrazi returned to his homeland and became the art advisor to the Shah of Iran and Kamran Diba, then director of the Teheran Museum of Contemporary Art. Shafrazi went to about 15 of the top New York dealers at the time ‚Äî including Leo Castelli, Ileana Sonnabend, Paula Cooper, John Weber, and Irving Blum ‚Äî and helped assemble a 20th-century art collection on the Shah's behalf within four years.Olga of Greece (December 2, 2007), Masterpiece Basement New York Times. As he did so his power expanded in the art market. The museum Shafrazi had constructed in Tehran to house this collection epitomized the Shah's modern Iranian state, thus the collection was predominantly Western: from Impressionism to Abstract Expressionism, Pop and Conceptual Art, including works by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Willem de Kooning. In 1978, Shafrazi briefly opened his own commercial gallery in a small Tehran shopfront but closed it because of conditions in the country leading up to the 1979 Revolution. He lost much of his art during that time but safely returned to New York City. Shafrazi converted his rented apartment into a makeshift gallery where he slept on a small loft bed at night. In 1979, he opened his first New York City gallery, and within a few years he had made his reputation handling talents like Donald Baechler and then-hot graffiti artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Kenny Scharf and also European artists like Brian Clarke, Enzo Cucchi, Herv√© Di Rosa, and Jean- Charles Blais. In 1990, he opened a new 13,000-square-foot gallery at 119 Wooster Street, with an exhibition entitled \\"American Masters of the 60's\\" and including Carl Andre, Tom Wesselmann, Jasper Johns, Donald Judd, Frank Stella, and Andy Warhol.Roberta Smith (May 11, 1990), So Big and So Dressed Up, New Galleries Bloom in SoHo New York Times.

General Motors pioneered the idea that consumers would aspire to buy up an automotive product ladder if a company met certain price points. As General Motors entered the 1920s, the product ladder started with the price-leading Chevrolet make, and then progressed in price, power and appointments to Oakland (later replaced by Pontiac), Oldsmobile, Buick, and ultimately to the luxury Cadillac marque. However, by the mid-1920s, a sizable price gap existed between Chevrolet and Oakland, while the difference between an Oldsmobile and a Buick was even wider. There was also a product gap between Buick and Cadillac. To address this, General Motors authorized the introduction of four \\"companion makes,\\" designed and priced to fill the gaps. Cadillac would introduce the LaSalle to fill the gap between Buick and Cadillac. Buick would introduce the Marquette to handle the higher end of the gap between Buick and Oldsmobile. Oldsmobile would introduce the Viking, which took the lower half of the spread between Oldsmobile and Buick. Finally, Oakland would introduce the Pontiac marque between it and Chevrolet. The final structure brand order: *Cadillac *LaSalle (Cadillac) *Buick *Marquette (Buick) *Viking (Oldsmobile) *Oldsmobile *Oakland *Pontiac (Oakland) *Chevrolet Chevrolet alone did not receive a companion car at this time. In the wake of the Great Depression, companion makes shortly failed: Marquette was discontinued in 1930 and Viking in 1931. LaSalle would fare a little better, surviving as a marque until being discontinued in 1940. Meanwhile, Pontiac outlasted its \\"parent\\" make Oakland: Oakland was discontinued in 1931, but Pontiac remained as a GM marque until 2010. Other manufacturers=Chrysler Chrysler Corporation introduced the Plymouth in 1928 as a base model, beneath pre-existing lines Dodge, DeSoto, Chrysler, and Imperial at the top. It was discontinued in 2001. Ford Ford Motor Company repeatedly experimented with companion makes. It added Lincoln-Zephyr as a companion make for Lincoln in 1936, introduced a De Luxe Ford as a companion make for its mainstream Ford line in 1937, and added the intermediate Mercury line to further fill the gap in 1939. This experiment was short-lived, however, with De Luxe Ford becoming a mere trim line in 1941, a year after Lincoln had discontinued Zephyr. In 1985, the Ford Germany-based Merkur brand was created as a companion brand to Lincoln that Ford hoped would appeal to import luxury buyers, but which would prove to be unsuccessful. Ford Motor Company would stick with Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln (with the brief exception of the Edsel failure) until 2010, when Ford announced the cessation of the Mercury brand. This simplified structure allowed Ford Division to expand upmarket more aggressively than Chevrolet with models such as the four- seat Thunderbird, the 1965 LTD and the current Titanium trim level models.

It is the headquarters of the Western Command of the Indian Army. Facilities Sectors A and B of Chandimandir are designated as its officers' families quarters. Sectors C, D, E, and F are assigned to families of junior commissioned officers and other ranks. Many military families stay in Panchkula in rented houses. Pine Marg is a residential area for senior officers. Manekshaw Auditorium, named after Field Marshal Manekshaw, and Raina Stadium, named after the former chief of the Indian Army are located on the base. The base includes the Western Command Hospital on the Chandigarh Kalka highway. It has two Kendriya Vidyalaya's, one Army Public School and one Army School within its limits. The Alpha and Officer's Institute, the Command Headquarters, the M.E.S. Inspection Bungalow, the Shivalik Retreat guest house, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief's residence, and the senior officers' residence (Pine Marg) are located on a hill in the western section of the cantonment, overlooking the other sectors. A deep gorge is located behind the base to the west. To the north of this hill is a golf course and helipad. The Khetarpaul Officer's Institute (K.O.I.) (formerly the Shivalik Officer's Institute (SOI) is located near the Shakti Dwar main gate to the cantonment, at the south of the camp, opening onto the highway leading to Panchkula sectors 1 and 6.  Surroundings  Outside the cantonment are the Chandimandir houses and small townships like Bir Ghaggar and Gumthala. The literacy level in these suburbs is lower than that of surrounding areas. A Chandi Devi temple is in Bir Ghaggar, from which Chandimandir and Chandigarh derive their names. The intermittent Ghaggar River flows through Chandimandir during the monsoon. This closed-drainage river is part of the Ghaggar-Hakra River. Saketri Shiv temple, 50 years old temple built by Sant Ram in 1960s, lies in the nearby Saketri village where damaged Shiv, Parvati and Ganesha stone sculptures weighing 1 quintal were found in the excavation.Haryana Samvad , Oct 2018. History The military camp was built in the late 1960s as the Western Army Command Headquarters of the Indian Army. A new branch of the army raised during the 1971 Indo-Pak war (II Corps) was housed there until the mid-1980s. Until then the Western Army Command had been in Simla, although not many Command units could be housed there due to a shortage of space; in the mid-1980s two corps (Kharga) moved to Ambala, and Western Command was relocated from Simla to Chandimandir. It is among the few modern military stations built in independent India whose history does not date back to the British Indian Army. Operation Blue Star In 1984, Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, deployed the army to flush Sikh militants along with Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his associates out of the Golden Temple at Amritsar complex. Code-named Operation Blue Star, the project was planned by Major General Kuldip Singh Brar, along with Lt. General Krishnaswamy Sundarji (then chief of western army command) and Lt. General Ranjit Singh Dyal (then command chief of staff). Immediately before the Operation, Brar was commanding the 9 Infantry Division out of Meerut. His three brigades were based in Meerut, Delhi and Jalandhar, two of them composed of Sikhs. On 31 May 1984, the day before Brar and his wife were to fly to Manila for a vacation, he received a call asking him to come to Chandimandir Cantonment. When Brar arrived, he was told to fly immediately to Amritsar, where a division had been relocated to the Indo-Pakistan border in case Pakistan moved in to support the pro-Khalistan militants. Geography The army base is in the foothills of the Shivaliks. The low rolling hills of the region are covered with dry thorny forests. To its northern edge, the forest and hills extend to the valley between the foothills and the main Himalayan range, containing the municipalities of Baddi and Nalagarh. Most of the trees and the green vegetation covering the foothills around Chandimandir were planted by the army. The trees are mostly kikar (Acacia), with Zizyphus berry bushes in the undergrowth. Three of the five kuls (canals) of Panchkula pass through this area. The village that gives Chandimandir Cantonment its name is on its Northeastern edge along the Chandigarh-Kalka highway. It lies north of Panchkula city, east of the Ghagghar River, and west of Mata Mansa Devi and Saketri, Nepal. Chandimandir is in the northwest of this Quadrant. The Chandimandir Old Panchkula Road forms its southern boundary. The Zirakpur Kalka highway is close to the western boundary, and the Ghagghar River forms parts of the western boundary. Chandigarh is 15 kilometers away, though the Sector 13 of Chandigarh is only some 4 kilometers.

The book was released in Australia on 28 September 2007, in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2007, and in the US on 13 November 2007. The title comes from the name given to Asian gangs involved in people smuggling illegal passports, visas, weapons, and more. Snakehead takes place directly after the events of Ark Angel, with Alex finding himself in Australian waters where he landed at the end of that story. Plot Alex Rider lands in the South Pacific after blowing up the Ark Angel in outer space. After his recovery, he is sent to a military base in Swanbourne, Australia. One day before his departure, he goes to a barbecue with some of the soldiers but finds himself on a minefield by accident, and narrowly avoids being killed by an armed landmine. Meanwhile, the criminal organization SCORPIA, as part of their mission to assassinate eight celebrities due to host a conference to rival the G8 summit on Reef Island (an island off the north- west coast of Australia), breaks into a Ministry of Defence weapons research centre and steals a prototype bomb \\"Royal Blue\\", a more powerful and devastating version of the daisy cutter. In Australia, Ethan Brooke, head of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), coerces Alex into helping him by pairing him with agent Ash, who was his godfather and once his father's best friend, to infiltrate the powerful snakehead ring under Winston Yu, after two failed attempts. Alex then travels to Bangkok, Thailand where he meets Ash, who explains that they will take on the identities of Afghan refugees who have paid the snakehead to smuggle them into Australia. After being disguised, they go to an area in Chinatown to await contact from the snakehead. To collect the papers necessary for them to move on to Indonesia, Alex is told by a Snakehead member, Anan Sukit, to fight in a Muay Thai boxing ring, which he wins by cheating. However, the unexpected victory incites a riot which Alex manages to escape when someone creates a diversion; Sukit is killed by the man who created the diversion. The next day, while Ash goes to the snakehead to retrieve the papers, Alex tails a suspicious-looking man who has been following him since he landed in Bangkok. The man reveals himself to be Ben \\"Fox\\" Daniels (introduced in Stormbreaker), an MI6 agent who had caused the diversion previously, and leads him to MI6, who is tracking down \\"Royal Blue\\" and Major Yu. MI6 also warns Alex that Major Yu, whom they suspect is in possession of the bomb, is actually a board member of SCORPIA. Alex agrees to help locate Royal Blue for MI6 and is given several gadgets by Smithers to use, including a seemingly broken watch with a homing beacon for MI6 to find him, three exploding Thai coins (one baht, five baht, and ten baht) and a belt equipped with jungle survival gear. After retrieving the papers, the two continue on to Jakarta; during the journey, Ash shares details about Alex's father, John, and Ash's botched mission in taking John out of SCORPIA, which despite being successful, led to the deaths of some MI6 agents. Ash was then demoted and eventually resigned from MI6, soon emigrating to Australia. In the snakehead's toy factory Unwin Toys, they are briefly apprehended by Kopassus, but Alex and Ash manage to board a container ship, the Liberian Star, but are separated; the Liberian Star is used for people smuggling by the Snakehead. Alex escapes from his container by using one of his coins and explores the ship and finds Royal Blue, hidden in a modified container. However, he goes into hiding when Major Yu discovers Alex's breakout and orders a search for him. The next day, Alex escapes the ship and reaches Darwin while damaging the reefers with another coin. However, to Alex's dismay, Ash is found to have been caught, and Alex thus surrenders to Yu, who knocks him unconscious. Alex wakes up and meets Yu over dinner, who then reveals his plan to cause a tsunami using the bomb to destroy Reef Island and stop the conference, along with destroying the west coast of Australia. Alex is then taken to a hospital in the Australian rainforest where he is to be used as an unwilling donor for illegal organ transplants, to pay for his damage to SCORPIA both in the 'Invisible Sword' project and on the Liberian Star. However, Alex manages to escape and establish contact with MI6. Along with Ben Daniels, Alex is sent as part of an Australian SAS team to the oil rig where Royal Blue will be detonated underneath. On the oil rig, Alex and Ben confront Yu and his assistant Ash, whom Ben shoots at before being shot by Yu. Ash, before dying, confesses about being a double agent for SCORPIA following the botched mission and his involvement in the death of Alex's parents which Alex had already suspected. Yu escapes but Alex detonates the bomb early and it goes off relatively harmlessly; the only casualty is Yu, who is killed in the resulting shock wave due to his inordinately fragile bone structure. At the end of the novel, Jack Starbright, Alex's housekeeper, unexpectedly calls Sabina Pleasure (his old friend who moved to San Francisco after the events of Eagle Strike) over for dinner. Both discuss plans to visit a castle in Scotland. The epilogue shows Ash's decision to join SCORPIA and his involvement in the death of Alex's parents, in a plane bombing.

She was one of the first submarines to be accepted into Royal Navy service, and unique to her class, she carried one of the earliest periscopes. By the time she was launched, a number of A-class submarines had already been ordered to replace this class in navy service. She had a single-hull design, built from \\"s\\" grade steel. She sank whilst under tow to the scrap yard in 1912, possibly caused by the torpedo hatch being left open. The wreck was rediscovered in 2000 and was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act in 2005. The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by Damage has been caused to the site in recent years, and at some point between September 2008 and June 2010, the torpedo hatch was stolen off the wreck. Design and description Holland 5 was the fifth of the experimental s to be launched, on 10 June 1902, at a cost of ¬£35,000. She was built by Vickers, Sons and Maxim in Barrow-in- Furness, under licence from Holland Torpedo Boat Company and to a design by John Phillip Holland. She was launched one month ahead of Holland 6 (which was later designated A1). The British Holland class was an extension of the design used on USS Holland. She was equipped with one of the first periscopes; at the time of her launch, no other submarines in the Royal Navy or the United States Navy were so equipped. It was of British design, which used a ball and socket joint on the hull to raise and lower the scope. She was constructed of \\"s\\" grade steel, which at the time of her construction was only used on this class of submarine and the Forth Bridge. She utilised a single-hull design, and so her pressure hull contained her fuel tanks, ballast and other internal workings. However, she was limited to a maximum depth of . Service history Along with Holland 3, she was one of the first two submarines to be accepted into Royal Navy service on 19 January 1903. However, by the time she was launched she was already considered obsolete and thirteen A-class submarines had already been ordered. On 4 March 1903, she was part of the flotilla of Holland-class submarines that were undergoing a demonstration for Captain Reginald Bacon in Stokes Bay when a gasoline explosion occurred aboard Holland 1. Along with the other Holland-class submarines, she was quickly reduced to the role of harbor defense and training. By 1909, at the time of fleet display in the Thames, the Holland class were no longer considered \\"seaworthy\\" by the media. In 1910, Holland 5 ran aground off Fort Blockhouse, the location of HMS Dolphin and the home of the Royal Navy Submarine Service. By 1912, the decision was made to scrap the Holland-class vessels. The submarine foundered in the English Channel off Beachy Head, Sussex, on 8 August 1912, when she was under tow on the way to being scrapped at Sheerness. It was not clear why she sank, but a theory is that the torpedo tube hatch was left open, causing the boat to take on water. Wreck discovery and research In September 2000, the wreck of submarine Holland 5 was discovered at a depth of about off the British coast near Eastbourne. In April 2001, the Archaeological Diving Unit conducted a sonar scan and confirmed the identity of the wreck. The boat sits upright on the seabed. On 4 January 2005, Andrew McIntosh, Minister for Tourism and Heritage of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, announced that the wreck was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act. This makes trophy hunting and vandalism of the site a criminal offence. McIntosh said of the announcement, \\"Only two of the Holland submarines survive today. The Holland no.5 is thought to be intact and in good condition. I am pleased that this Order will preserve the wreck site allowing proper study of the vessel and preventing any vandalism by trophy hunters.\\" In August 2005 and August 2006, amateur archaeologists had the opportunity to dive the wreck as part of a research programme led by official licensee Innes McCartney and nominated archaeologist Mark Beattie-Edwards, under the auspices of the Nautical Archaeology Society. Following further dives in June 2010 and August 2010, it was discovered that at some point divers had stolen the torpedo tube hatch off the wreck. It was determined that the item would have no monetary value and would have gone into a private collection. There were no official dives on the wreck during 2009 due to the conditions, and the last sighting of the hatch in place was in September 2008. Further damage has been caused to the site by fishing nets, which may have resulted in damage to the periscope and the other implements installed on the upper superstructure. Holland 5 remains the only submarine of her class on the seabed. Holland 1, the only other boat of her class remaining, is on show at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Gosport, Hampshire. Species seen on or around the wreck site include brown crabs, European spider crabs, poutings, poor cod, Sagartia elegans (a species of sea anemone), worms of the Serpulidae family, and European Conger. The Nautical Archaeology Society run dive trips to the wreck site, and have developed a virtual dive trail.

The book was released in the United Kingdom on July 8, 2002, and in the United States on April 28, 2003. Summary On the fictional island of Skeleton Key, off the coast of Cuba, three men meet and supply General Alexei Sarov with uranium and attempt to blackmail him into giving them $1 million more or they will go to the American authorities. Taking this as a threat, General Sarov switches off the runway lights when the plane is about to take off, causing them to fall into crocodile-infested waters. Meanwhile, after the events of Point Blanc, it is revealed that the real Alex Rider survived the fight with his clone. John Crawley approaches Alex at school and offers him tickets to Wimbledon where he goes undercover as a ball boy to investigate a break-in. While managing to foil the Chinese Triad gang Big Circle's attempt for match-fixing, Alex is targeted by the triad gang. After a second attempt on his life is made while surfing on vacation with Sabina Pleasure, whom he befriended at Wimbledon, both MI6 and the CIA arrange to send him away for his own safety. He will be partnered with CIA agents Tom Turner (rennamed \\"Glen Carver\\" in American versions of the novel) and Belinda Troy to Skeleton Key to investigate General Sarov. The CIA is concerned about the actions of Sarov and his meeting with the Russian president (and a childhood friend of Sarov's) Boris Kiriyenko in a few days' time. En route to Skeleton Key, the 'family' of Alex, Turner, and Troy stop in Miami. Much to Alex's frustration, the two CIA agents are openly unhappy about bringing Alex and they attempt to keep as much information from Alex as possible, clearly discrediting him. Turner meets a criminal known as 'the Salesman' on a boat, the Mayfair Lady, suspecting that the Salesman was involved in a deal with Sarov, who did indeed give Sarov his uranium. The Salesman, however, is aware of Turner's true identity and plans to kill and dump him in the sea. Alex sneaks aboard the boat, knocks out a guard by using a drugged dart in a mobile phone (given by Smithers), and sets fire to it, causing a distraction. While both Alex and Turner escape by jumping into the sea, the Mayfair Lady suddenly explodes, killing everyone on board. Turner blames Alex for causing the explosion, who insists he wasn't responsible. (It is left ambiguous as to who caused the boat to explode at this point) In Skeleton Key, Alex notices a Geiger counter in a Game Boy Advance console he was given by his 'parents' that is designed to pick up nuclear radiation, deducing that Turner and Troy were, in fact, sent to the island to search for a nuclear bomb. The two CIA agents then reluctantly revealed that they suspect Sarov of constructing a nuclear bomb using the uranium bought from the Salesman and tell their plan to infiltrate Sarov's residence ‚Äì the Casa de Oro, by scuba diving into a cave underneath the house. Alex goes with them but stays on the boat while Turner and Troy go underwater. When they do not return after a while, Alex dives in and, after a close encounter with a shark, discovers a mechanical spear trap that impaled Turner and Troy, which kills the shark as well. When he resurfaces, Garcia, the boat driver, has been killed and Alex is captured by Conrad, Sarov's deformed right-hand man, who drugs him. Although Alex unwillingly tells the truth when interrogated by Conrad, he decides to kill him anyway by having him fed into a sugar-making machine. Sarov stops him at the last second and Alex passes out. Alex wakes up in the Casa de Oro and meets with Sarov, who says he had known all about the cave, and he promises to tell Alex what he plans to do with him. He also revealed that Conrad planted an explosive on the Mayfair Lady, worried that he will carry out his threat after not receiving any further payment and the death of the three couriers. The next day, Sarov tells Alex about his son Vladamir who was killed in the war in Afghanistan. He plans to adopt Alex as he shares many traits with Vladamir, due to their similar physical appearance and common traits, such as patriotism. He then has Alex moved to the slave house when President Kiriyenko arrives. Alex attempts to escape the mansion by hiding in the boot of a car, but is caught by Sarov using a heartbeat detector. The general spares Alex's life yet again but punishes him through psychological torture. At dinner later that evening, Sarov drugs Kiriyenko and his guests and moves them to the slave house. With the finished nuclear bomb loaded onto Kiriyenko's private Presidential jet, whose pilots serve Sarov, Sarov himself, Alex, Conrad and a small security team takes off and heads to Murmansk, Russia, which Sarov says contains a shipyard of nuclear submarines. During the flight, Sarov revealed that he plans to detonate the bomb there which will cause a massive explosion and a nuclear fallout. Russia will be blamed and they will turn to their President. Sarov will then release edited footage from an interview which will disgrace Kiriyenko, ousting him from power while reverting Russia back to communism under Sarov, while others in northern Europe die from the nuclear fallout. Sarov will then instigate wars all over the planet until the entire world is united under a communist government, with himself at the helm, and plans for Alex to take over Sarov in the future. When the plane makes a fuel stop in Edinburgh, Alex uses a stun grenade disguised as a Michael Owen keyring, again given by Smithers, to escape from the plane, incapacitating Sarov and Conrad temporarily. Alex attempts to call the police but is stopped by a security guard named George Prescott. Despite Alex's efforts to convince Prescott of the situation, Sarov recaptures Alex and Prescott is killed by Conrad. At Murmansk, Conrad plants the bomb on a submarine, while Alex is handcuffed to a handrail close to the submarines. An apologetic Sarov approaches him and says although he is reluctant, he has to kill him due to Alex's betrayal earlier, before leaving for Moscow by himself, with soldiers who fought under him in Afghanistan and are fanatically loyal to him. Alex sets himself free by stuffing rapidly- expanding chewing gum, the last gadget which Smithers provided, into the handcuff lock and fights with Conrad, while the Russian army and navy arrive and initiate a firefight against Sarov's men. Although Conrad outmatches Alex, Conrad (who has numerous pieces of metal inside his body following a failed bombing several years earlier) is caught by the crane's electromagnet passing overhead, lifting him into the air and killing him in the process. Alex takes control of the crane, dropping Conrad's body into the sea and removing the nuclear bomb from the submarine. He then removes the detonation card, only to be told to put it back at gunpoint by a reappearing, injured Sarov, who threatens to override the bomb, killing themselves and everyone else at the shipyard but still setting the plan in motion. Alex instead throws the card into the ocean and rejects becoming Sarov's son. Unable to live with himself anymore, and to avoid being put on trial, Sarov shoots himself, committing suicide in front of Alex. In the final chapter of the novel, it is revealed that when Alex explained his predicament to Prescott, his office heard their conversation through Prescott's radio, which was still turned on. They immediately notified MI6, who in turn warned the Russians. Alex is depressed after everything he has been through, but Sabina approaches him and invites him on holiday with her family in France for a couple of weeks, which cheers Alex up. Graphic novel In 2009 a graphic novel adaptation of Skeleton Key was released through Walker Books. This version altered some elements from the original novel, such as eliminating the attack on Alex while he was surfing in Cornwall, as well as having Sabina, already friends with Alex, attending Wimbledon as a spectator. Reception Critical reception for both versions of Skeleton Key was mostly positive, with Booklist giving the novel version a positive review. The print version of Skeleton Key was named as one of ALA's Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers for 2004. The School Library Journal has given praise for both editions of the story, calling the print version \\"rip-roaring\\" while recommending the graphic novel as a pick for \\"reluctant readers\\".

In South Africa the word uMlungu, used mostly by Zulu speakers, is not to be confused with this article, it is a homophone (homograph) to this article's Mulungu/Mlungu, and a synonym of Mzungu. It being used to describe those of English European descent, and the word Bhunu, (from ), to describe those of Dutch/German European descent. It is also used regardless of race or ethnicity, to describe a customer/business client, a wealthy person or a supervisor/boss, casually. The words related to ‚ÄúWhite person ‚Äù in Zulu In traditional Bantu cultures=Origin, diffusion, and etymology The original early-Bantu name for the creator God was probably Ny√†mb√©, possibly from the verb root -√†mb-, \\"to begin\\". With the diversification of Bantu cultures, other names came about, with \\"Mulungu\\" emerging in the ancient Southern-Kaskazi group (about 6000 BC). The etymology of the name is disputed. One hypothesis is that the name is derived from a verb root -ng-, meaning \\"to be rectified\\", \\"to become right\\"; in this case, the original concept of Mulungu is that of a creator god that established the original, right order on the world. Description All traditional Bantu cultures have a notion of a \\"creator god\\", a concept which was already established in the Niger-Congo cultures. This creator god is usually seen as a remote deity, far and detached from men and living beings; in some cases, it is more of an impersonal \\"creating force\\" or a primum movens than a \\"God\\" in the usual sense of the word. Even when described as a personal god, the Creator is believed to be far and detached from men and living beings; this detachment is the subject of a number of Bantu myths describing how the creator left the Earth, moving to the sky, as a consequence of him being upset with men or annoyed by their activities. It is thus a common trait of Bantu religions that no prayers, and usually no worship, is actually directed to the creator; men interact with lower-levels gods and spirits that are closer and more interested in human affairs. These general lines are common to traditional concepts of Mulungu as found in Kikuyu, Ruvu, and other cultures. A Nyamwezi myth about the departure of Mulungu from the Earth involves Mulungu being upset of the fires set by men to the landscape, and asking the spider to weave a web for him to climb up to the sky.Mulungu on Myth Encyclopedia Modern uses With the advent of either Islam or Christianity, the word \\"Mulungu\\" was usually adopted to mean the Christian or Islamic God. Over thirty translations of the Bible in African languages use the word Mulungu to refer to the Father.Bleeker and Windengreen (1971), p. 556 As another example, Jesus Christ is referred to as mwana wa Mulungu (\\"child of Mulungu\\") in modern religious songs in Chichewa language (Malawi).

The procedure is common among people with cleft palate and some types of dysarthria. Pharyngeal flap procedures Posterior pharyngeal flap surgery is the most commonly used operation to restore velopharyngeal competence (i.e., develop a functional seal between the nasal cavity and the oral cavity), and therefore correct hypernasality and nasal air escape (Ysunza et al., 2002). Posterior pharyngeal flaps can be based superiorly or inferiorly and the velum can be split transversely or along the midline (Lideman-Boshki et al., 2005). Centrally positioned, superior based flaps continue to be the most popular pharyngeal flap choice, yet inferior based flaps are easier for the surgeon to perform. Compared to superiorly based flaps, inferiorly based flaps are limited in regard to the size of velopharyngeal opening that can be covered (Peterson-Falzone et al., 2001). Pharyngoplasties correcting hypernasal speech can be traced back as far as the 19th century when Passavant first explored palatopexy in a 23-year-old female (Hall et al., 1991). In 1876, Schoenborn also attempted to reduce the amount of air entering the nasal cavity by developing the first true inferior based pharyngeal flap surgery, where a flap of tissue was sutured into the velum and attached to the lower end of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Modifying his technique, Schoenborn published a superior based pharyngeal flap surgery in 1886, where the flap of tissue attached to the upper end of the posterior pharyngeal wall. In 1928, Rosenthal used an inferiorly based posterior pharyngeal flap in combination with a modified von Langenbeck palatoplasty in primary surgery for cleft palate repair. Taking a different approach, Padgett (1930) utilized a superiorly based flap for cleft palate patients whose primary surgical repair had been unsuccessful (Sloan, 2000). By the 1950s, posterior pharyngeal flap surgery became widely adopted in the correction of VPI (Peterson-Falzone et al., 2001). In the 1970s, Hogan and Shprintzen advanced posterior pharyngeal flaps, leading to an increased success rate in the elimination of VPI. Hogan (1973) proposed a ‚Äòlateral portal control‚Äô flap to modulate the postoperative port size. In this flap, lateral ports exist on both sides of the pharyngeal flap to assist in drainage, nasal breathing, and nasal resonance. Using the pressure-flow studies of Warren and colleagues as a basis for lateral port size, Hogan placed a 4 mm diameter catheter through the lateral ports on either side of the flap to tailor the port size to the perception of nasal resonance (Sloan, 2000). Consistent with Warren‚Äôs aerodynamic data, Hogan advocated that the velopharyngeal opening be no greater than 4 mm in diameter because a larger gap would most likely result in hypernasal speech (Peterson- Falzone et al., 2001). In 1979, Shprintzen advocated ‚Äòtailor-made‚Äô flaps, with the width of the flap determined by the degree of preoperative lateral pharyngeal wall adduction. According to Shprintzen, the base of the pharyngeal flap should be positioned at the site with the greatest level of lateral pharyngeal wall movement. In addition, Shprintzen recommends that a narrower flap be used with pronounced lateral pharyngeal wall movement, while a wider flap should be used with limited lateral pharyngeal wall movement (Sloan, 2000) Use of a narrow flap in individuals with limited preoperative lateral pharyngeal wall movement has the potential to increase lateral pharyngeal wall movement postoperatively (Karling et al., 1999). Candidacy Pharyngeal flap surgery may be recommended to resolve velopharyngeal incompetence after patients prove unable to achieve significant speech improvements through speech therapy alone. Other requirements to qualify for the surgery include a short and immobile or easily fatigued palate (Mazaheri et al., 1994). The patient‚Äôs pattern of VP closure is one aspect that is taken take into consideration by doctors in deciding whether pharyngeal flap surgery is the appropriate method of treatment (Armour et al., 2005). A variety of closure patterns have been found, and the pattern varies person to person. When planning pharyngeal flap surgery, it is imperative for the doctor to match the postoperative structure to the preoperative movements in order for an adequate seal to be achieved (Ysunza et al., 2002). Research has found that pharyngeal flap surgery has been most effective for those with a sagittal closure pattern (good lateral wall movement but poor velar movement (Armour et al., 2005)). Pharyngeal flap surgery is not recommended for everyone and alternative treatment methods are available. One alternative is the use of a prosthesis. In some instances, a prosthesis is capable of stimulating pharyngeal wall movement, thus aiding in VP closure. Most often, prostheses have been recommended for use in young children (Mazaheri et al., 1994). Currently, no accurate method is available to determine whether a pharyngeal flap or an alternative method will have better results for eliminating velopharnygeal incompetence. Pharyngeal flap surgery has been completed in both children and adults. When younger children undergo the surgery, fewer speech impairments tend to occur. A possible explanation is that the earlier the surgery, the less likely the child will have developed compensatory strategies to overcome the velopharyngeal incompetence (Armour et al., 2005). However, with thorough preoperative planning, pharyngeal flap surgery can be just as effective in eliminating VPI in adults as it is in children (Hall et al., 1991). Complications The most common complications of pharyngeal flap surgery include airway obstruction and sleep apnea (Pena, 2000). Snoring has also been noted as a possible negative outcome of the surgery (Sloan, 2000). As a result of flap surgery, the airway is compromised in several ways. Some of the issues associated with this compromise include: narrowing of the nasal and oral airway secondary to edema, impeding of the nasopharynx by the flap itself, anatomical changes in which the oropharynx becomes smaller, and decreased respiratory drive following anesthesia. There is also a correlation between the individuals who have this surgery and the presence of other craniofacial and neurological conditions. These factors together may lead to the above complications (Pena, 2000). Postoperative airway obstruction may range from mild stridor events to severe blockage of the airway resulting in intubation or tracheostomy. All patients should be closely monitored following surgery due to the possible damage to the newly repaired palate or even the risk of death. In the literature, airway obstruction following pharyngeal flap surgery using the Wardill-Kilner and von Langenbeck techniques are well documented. It has been concluded that individuals with Franceschetti syndrome or Pierre Robin sequence are at increased risk for developing airway obstruction following pharyngoplasty due to their shallow nasopharyngeal airway and inadequate maxillofacial growth at the time of the surgery. It is also believed that prolonged duration of the surgical procedure may be directly correlated with an increased incidence of airway obstruction. Age does not seem to influence the risk. Factors that increase the risk of airway obstruction include associated congenital anomalies and a history of airway problems (Anthony & Sloan, 2002). Sleep apnea can be categorized as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or central sleep apnea. The potential health risks of OSA are severe and therefore even a small percentage of incidence is considered significant. Obstructive sleep apnea symptoms must be carefully assessed following pharyngeal flap surgery (Ysunza). This condition was found to be more commonly linked to posterior pharyngeal flap surgery, however, pharyngeal flaps are considered to be more valuable in correcting velopharyngeal function than other treatment options, especially in severe cases of VPI (Sloan, 2000). It has also been reported that large tonsils have been found in a high percentage of OSA cases. Large tonsils may be shifted posteriorly, under the ports of the flap. In superiorly-based pharyngeal flaps, tonsils are a likely contributor to OSA. Surgical procedures such as uvulopalatopharyngoplasties and tonsillectomies may be required to resolve the OSA. Consequently, tonsillar tissue is an important area of pre-operative assessment (Ysunza et al., 1993). Outcomes Pharyngeal flap surgery may be able to improve speech performance in children or adults with a cleft palate who have velopharyngeal insufficiency. In fact, there is a high success rate for improvement of speech following pharyngeal flap surgery. However, surgery does not guarantee perfect or 100% intelligible speech. In addition to speech improvements, pharyngeal flap surgery may help eliminate hypernasality, nasal turbulence, and facial grimacing (Tonz et al., 2002). Often, speech improvements are not obvious immediately following the surgery. Speech improvements are more prevalent after one year post surgery and usually continue for several years. The outcomes of pharyngeal flap surgery vary among each individual in regards to improvements in hyponasality, hypernasality, nasal turbulence, voice quality, articulation, and intelligibility (Tonz et al., 2002; Liedman-Boshki et al., 2005). Patients who undergo pharyngeal flap surgery encounter the risk of never breathing through their nose again, which could create abnormal speech (i.e., denasal resonance) (Witt et al., 1998). It is estimated that around 20-30% of patients with clefts develop hypernasal speech after pharyngeal flap surgery (Heliovaara et al., 2003). The percentage reported for individuals developing hypernasal speech is debated by researchers. It is possible that hypernasality can be a side effect of pharyngeal flap surgery, however hyponasal speech occurs more frequently after a successful surgery (Liedman-Boshki et al., 2005). It is also possible that pharyngeal flap surgery will be unsuccessful. Some patients may even require secondary surgery for velopharyngeal insufficiency. It is common that individuals who have to undergo a second surgery could develop secondary speech problems, more specifically compensatory articulation and resonance disorders. Problems occurring post secondary surgery are often more difficult to extinguish (Tonz et al., 2002). As previously mentioned, one problem that may occur after surgery is hypernasality. This is caused when a narrow flap and inadequate lateral pharyngeal wall movement prohibit lateral port closure during phonation. There are several other reasons surgery may fail the first time, including a poorly designed flap such as one that is too narrow, postoperative scar (contracture of the flap), or inappropriate patient selection. Also, the flap may be too wide and occlude the lateral ports. There are higher rates of surgical failure in children with a history of perinatal upper airway obstruction, such as those with Robin sequence (Witt et al., 1998). The type of cleft, as well as the type of flap used (superiorly or inferiorly-based) does not seem to make a difference in postoperative speech outcomes. It has been reported that different types of flaps give different speech configurations, however the results showed equally good outcomes for postoperative speech, regardless of the type of flap used. Therefore, it is imperative that the surgeon selects the right type of flap for each individual (Liedman-Boshki et al., 2005). Overall, speech should improve after pharyngeal flap surgery. It is important to remember that improvement is variable and individuals react to surgery differently. Changes in speech do not always occur immediately after surgery, but this does not mean improvements will not be made. Lastly, speech problems such as compensatory articulation strategies do not often extinguish on their own. A speech language pathologist is usually involved both before and after pharyngeal flap surgery to monitor and help improve speech difficulties. Alternatives Augmentation pharyngoplasty is a common alternative operation.

Staryi Chortoryis'k, ) is a village (selo) in north-western Ukraine. It is located on the bank of the Styr River in the Manevychi Raion (district) of the Volyn Oblast (province). One of the most ancient settlements of Volhynia, Chortoriysk (or Chertoryesk) was first mentioned in 1100 in the Hypatian Chronicle, where it was recorded as having been passed to Prince David Igorevych (or Davyd Ihorevych) of Volhynia (1087-1099), together with Dubno, Busk and Ostroh. . In the 13th century, it was claimed by the rulers of Pinsk, who built a tower in Chortoryisk resembling the famous Bela Vezha in Kamieniec. By the end of the 14th century, the town had become the seat of Algirdas's son Constantine (from whose son, Vasili Konstantinovich, the well-known Polish family of Czartoryski is descended). On 26 August 1431 a truce was signed at Chortoryisk between the forces of Poland and Lithuania, bringing to an end the brief Lutsk War between the two. The current village of Staryi Chortoryisk was established in 1900, in place of the ancient settlement. Staryi Chortoryisk was site of a major battle between the Russian and German army in World War I. In both October 1915 and May 1919, there were major encounters between the two sides. Staryi Chortoryisk had a large Jewish population until World War I, when most of them fled to escape the fighting between the German and Russian army. Among the prominent natives is the world-famous economist Rose Friedman (wife of Nobel Prize winner economist Milton Friedman), along with her brother, Law Professor Aaron Director who left to Oregon USA around 1913. The Directors were prominent members of the Jewish community in Staryi Chortoryisk . In addition, the famous Rubin (formerly Rabin) family is from Staryi Chortoryisk. The Polish playwright Franciszka Urszula Radziwi≈Ç≈Çowa was born in Staryi Chortoryisk. The village's main landmark is the church of the Blackfriars, built in the Baroque style in 1741 to replace an earlier church from 1639.

This war consisted of a series of conflicts and minor wars, such as the Second Sacred War. There were several causes for the war including the building of the Athenian long walls, Megara's defection and the envy and concern felt by Sparta at the growth of the Athenian Empire. The First Peloponnesian War began in 460 BC with the Battle of Oenoe, where Spartan forces were defeated by those of Athenian-Argive alliance.Pausanias, & Frazer, J. G. (1898). Pausanias's Description of Greece. London: Macmillan. p. 138E. D. Francis and Michael Vickers, Oenoe Painting in the Stoa Poikile, and Herodotus' Account of Marathon. The Annual of the British School at Athens Vol. 80, (1985), pp. 99‚Äì113In 460 BC, Argos rises against Sparta. Athens supports Argos and Thessaly. The small force that is sent by Sparta to quell the uprising in Argos is defeated by a joint Athenian and Argos force at Oenoe.Thucydides, & in Jowett, B. (1900). Thucydides. Oxford: Clarendon Press. pp. 107‚Äì09 At first the Athenians had the better of the fighting, winning the naval engagements using their superior fleet. They also had the better of the fighting on land, until 457 BC when the Spartans and their allies defeated the Athenian army at Tanagra. The Athenians, however, counterattacked and scored a crushing victory over the Boeotians at the Battle of Oenophyta and followed this victory up by conquering all of Boeotia except for Thebes. Athens further consolidated their position by making Aegina a member of the Delian League and by ravaging the Peloponnese. The Athenians were defeated in 454 BC by the Persians in Egypt which caused them to enter into a five years' truce with Sparta. However, the war flared up again in 448 BC with the start of the Second Sacred War. In 446 BC, Boeotia revolted and defeated the Athenians at Coronea and regained their independence. The First Peloponnesian War ended in an arrangement between Sparta and Athens, which was ratified by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446‚Äì445 BC). According to the provisions of this peace treaty, both sides maintained the main parts of their empires. Athens continued its domination of the sea while Sparta dominated the land. Megara returned to the Peloponnesian League and Aegina became a tribute-paying but autonomous member of the Delian League. The war between the two leagues restarted in 431 BC, leading to the Second Peloponnesian War. It ended with a conclusive Spartan victory, where, in 404 BC, Athens was occupied by Sparta. Origins and causes A map of the Delian League. Only twenty years before the First Peloponnesian War broke out, Athens and Spartans had fought alongside each other in the Greco-Persian Wars. In that war, Sparta held hegemony over what modern scholars call the Hellenic League and the overall command in the crucial victories of 480 and 479 BC. Over the next several years, however, Spartan leadership bred resentment among the Greek naval powers that took the lead in carrying the war against Persian territories in Asia and the Aegean, and after 478 BC the Spartans abandoned their leadership of this campaign.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.95. Sparta grew wary of Athens' strength after they had fought alongside each other to disperse the Persians from their lands. When Athens started to rebuild its walls and the strength of its naval power, Sparta and its allies began to fear that Athens was becoming too powerful.Karl Walling, \\"Thucydides On Policy, Strategy, And War termination,\\" Naval War College Review Vol. 66 (autumn 2013): 49‚Äì50. Different policies made it difficult for Athens and Sparta to avoid going to war, since Athens wanted to expand its territory and Sparta wanted to dismantle the Athenian democratic regime.Karl Walling, \\"Thucydides On Policy, Strategy, And War termination,\\" Naval War College Review Vol. 66 (autumn 2013): 49 Athens, meanwhile, had been asserting itself on the international scene, and was eager to take the lead in the Aegean. The Athenians had already rebuilt their walls, against the express wishes of Sparta.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.89‚Äì93. In 479 BC and 478 BC Athens also took a much more active role in the Aegean campaigning. In the winter of 479‚Äì478 BC they accepted the leadership of a new league, the Delian League, in a conference of Ionian and Aegean states at Delos. The Athenians rebuilt their walls in secret at the urging of Themistocles, who convinced the Athenians that this was the best way to protect themselves. Themistocles also delayed talks with Sparta for universal arms control by constantly finding issues with Sparta's proposals, stating that it would leave Athens vulnerable to Sparta's superior hoplites and phalanx fighting formation.Karl Walling, \\"Thucydides On Policy, Strategy, And War termination,\\" Naval War College Review Vol. 66 (autumn 2013):51‚Äì52. After the completion of the walls Themistocles declared Athens independent of Spartan hegemony, stating that Athens knew what was in its best interest and was now strong enough to defend itself.Karl Walling, \\"Thucydides On Policy, Strategy, And War termination,\\" Naval War College Review Vol. 66 (autumn 2013): 52. At this time, one of the first hints of animosity between Athens and Sparta emerged in an anecdote reported by Diodorus Siculus, who said that the Spartans in 475‚Äì474 BC considered reclaiming the hegemony of the campaign against Persia by force.Diodorus Siculus, Library . Modern scholars, although uncertain of the dating and reliability of this story, have generally cited it as evidence of the existence, even at this early date, of a \\"war party\\" in Sparta.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 51‚Äì52.de Ste. Croix, Origins of the Peloponnesian War, 171‚Äì72. The Athenian long walls which connected Athens to Piraeus. For some time, however, friendly relations prevailed between Athens and Sparta. Themistocles, the Athenian of the period most associated with an anti-Spartan policy, was ostracised at some point in the late 470s BC, and was later forced to flee to Persia.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 53‚Äì55. In his place, the Athenian general and statesman Cimon advocated a policy of cooperation between the two states, acting as Athens' proxenos at Sparta.de Ste Croix, Origins of the Peloponnesian War, 172. Still, hints of conflict emerged. Thucydides reports that in the mid 460s BC, Sparta decided to invade Attica during the Thasian rebellion, but was stopped by an earthquake in 464 BC that triggered a revolt among the helots.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.101A.J. Holladay \\"Sparta's Role in The First Peloponnesian War\\", The Journal of The Hellenic Studies Vol. 97. (1977): 60. It was that helot revolt which would eventually bring on the crisis that precipitated the war. Unable to quell the revolt themselves, the Spartans summoned all their allies to assist them, invoking the old Hellenic League ties. Athens responded to the call, sending out 4,000 men with Cimon at their head.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 73‚Äì82.de Ste. Croix, Origins of the Peloponnesian War, 180‚Äì83. However, something either in the behaviour or appearance of the Athenian force insulted the Spartans and they dismissed the Athenians, alone of all their allies.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.102. This action destroyed the political credibility of Cimon; he had already been under assault by his Athenian opponents led by Ephialtes, and shortly after this embarrassment he was ostracised. The demonstration of Spartan hostility was unmistakable, and when Athens responded, events spiralled rapidly into war. Athens concluded several alliances in quick succession: one with Thessaly, a powerful state in the north; one with Argos, Sparta's traditional enemy for centuries; and one with Megara, a former ally of Sparta's which was faring badly in a border war with Sparta's more powerful ally, Corinth. At about the same time, Athens settled the helots exiled after the defeat of their revolt at Naupactus on the Corinthian Gulf. By 460 BC, Athens found itself openly at war with Corinth and several other Peloponnesian states, and a larger war was imminent. Early battles As this war was beginning, Athens also took on a serious military commitment in another part of the Aegean when they sent a force to assist Inarus, a Libyan king who had led almost all of Egypt in revolt from the Persian king Artaxerxes. Athens and her allies sent a fleet of 200 ships to assist Inarus; a substantial investment of resources.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.104. Thus, Athens entered the war with her forces spread across several theatres of conflict. The impact this had on the Athenians can be seen in an inscription dating to 460 or 459 BC which lists the dead of the tribe Erechtheis. It is unusual in focusing on a single tribe as it was common for the dead of all ten tribes to be listed together on either a single Stele or several adjoining stelai with a common title. Perhaps it can be explained in this instance, however, by the unusually high death toll;Meiggs, R.and D.M. Lewis. A Selection of Greek Historical Inscriptions to the end of the Fifth Century B.C. Oxford 1969. 185 personal names are listed on the inscription in total. The list is preceded by an inscription which is translated thus: 'Of the tribe Erechtheis, these died in the war, in Cyprus, in Egypt, in Phoenicia, in Halieis, in Aegina, at Megara, during the same year'.Robin Osborne and P. J. Rhodes. Greek Historical Inscriptions 478-404 BC Oxford 2017 This fits very closely with Thucydides' account,Thucydides 1.104-5 the last three chronologically following the order he gives. Thucydides does not, however, mention Phoenicia, so the inscription gives evidence for fighting in a place we would otherwise not associate with this period. Also significant is the phrase ŒµŒΩ œÑ·ø≥ œÄŒøŒªŒµŒº·ø≥ 'in the war' suggesting that all these arenas were still considered (or intended to seem) a single war, in contrast to a similar list of the 440sBC where the casualties died ŒµŒΩ œÑŒøŒπœÇ œÄŒøŒªŒµŒºŒøŒπœÇ 'in the wars'. CF Peloponnesian War In either 460 or 459 BC, Athens fought a number of major battles against the combined forces of several Peloponnesian states. On land, the Athenians were defeated by the armies of Corinth and Epidaurus at Halieis, but at sea they were victorious at Cecryphaleia (a small island between Aegina and the coast of Epidaurus).Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.105. Alarmed by this Athenian aggressiveness in the Saronic Gulf, Aegina entered into the war against Athens, combining its powerful fleet with that of the Peloponnesian allies.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 84. In the resulting sea battle, the Athenians won a commanding victory, capturing seventy Aeginetan and Peloponnesian ships. They then landed at Aegina and, led by Leocrates, laid siege to the city. With substantial Athenian detachments tied down in Egypt and Aegina, Corinth invaded the Megarid, attempting to force the Athenians to withdraw their forces from Aegina to meet this new threat.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.105‚Äì6. Instead, the Athenians scraped together a force of men too old and boys too young for ordinary military service and sent this force, under the command of Myronides, to relieve Megara. The resulting battle was indecisive, but the Athenians held the field at the end of the day and were thus able to set up a trophy of victory. About twelve days later the Corinthians attempted to return to the site to set up a trophy of their own, but the Athenians issued forth from Megara and routed them; during the retreat after the battle a large section of the Corinthian army blundered into a ditch-ringed enclosure on a farm, where they were trapped and massacred. Athenian successes=Tanagra A Greek hoplite made up the majority of the soldiers in a state's army. For several years at the beginning of the war, Sparta remained largely inert. Spartan troops may have been involved in some of the early battles of the war, but if so, they were not specifically mentioned in any sources.de Ste. Croix, Origins of the Peloponnesian War, 188. In 458 BC or 457 BC,Kagan places these events in 458, while de Ste. Croix is unsure; other scholars also differ. Sparta at last made a move, but not directly at Athens. A war had broken out between Athens' ally Phocis and Doris, across the Corinthian Gulf from the Peloponnese.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.107‚Äì8. Doris was traditionally identified as the homeland of the Dorians, and the Spartans, being Dorians, had a long-standing alliance with that state. Accordingly, a Spartan army under the command of the general Nicomedes, acting as deputy for the under-age king Pleistoanax, was dispatched across the Corinthian Gulf to assist. This army forced the Phocians to accept terms, but while the army was in Doris an Athenian fleet moved into position to block its return across the Corinthian Gulf. At this point Nicomedes led his army south into B≈ìotia. Several factors may have influenced his decision to make this move. First, secret negotiations had been underway with a party at Athens which was willing to betray the city to the Spartans in order to overthrow the democracy. Furthermore, Donald Kagan has suggested that Nicomedes had been in contact with the government of Thebes and planned to unify Boeotia under Theban leadership; which, upon his arrival, he seems to have done.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 90.Diodorus Siculus, Library, 11.81. With a strong Spartan army in Boeotia and the threat of treason in the air, the Athenians marched out with as many troops, both Athenian and allied, as they could muster to challenge the Peloponnesians. The two armies met at the Battle of Tanagra. Before the battle, the exiled Athenian politician Cimon, armoured for battle, approached the Athenian lines to offer his services, but was ordered to depart; before going, he ordered his friends to prove their loyalty through their bravery.Plutarch, Cimon, . This they did, but the Athenians were defeated in the battle, although both sides suffered heavy losses. The Spartans, rather than invading Attica, marched home across the isthmus, and Donald Kagan believes that at this point Cimon was recalled from exile and negotiated a four-month truce between the sides; other scholars believe no such truce was concluded, and place Cimon's return from exile at a later date.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 91. Athenian success can also be attributed to them making an alliance with Argos, Sparta's enemy and only threat for control over the Peloponnesian league. The alliance between Athens and Argos was moreover seen as a defensive measure to counteract Sparta's military strength.A.J. Holladay, \\"Sparta and The First Peloponnesian War,\\" The Journal of Hellenistic Studies Vol. 105. (1985): 162 Athens conquers A Greek trireme, the main type of ships used by the Greek states. The Athenians rebounded well after their defeat at Tanagra, by sending an army under Myronides to attack Boeotia.Thucydides 1.108 The Boeotian army gave battle to the Athenians at Oenophyta. The Athenians scored a crushing victory which led to the Athenians conquering all of Boeotia except for Thebes, as well as Phocis and Locris. The Athenians pulled down Tanagra's fortifications and took the hundred richest citizens of Locris and made them hostages. The Athenians also took this chance to complete the construction of their long walls. Shortly after this, Aegina surrendered and was forced to pull down its walls, surrender its fleet and became a tribute-paying member of the Delian League, completing what Donald Kagan has called an annus mirabilis for the Athenians.Kagan, The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War\\", 95 The Athenians, pleased by their success, sent an expedition under the general Tolmides to ravage the coast of the Peloponnese. The Athenians circumnavigated the Peloponnese and attacked and sacked the Spartan dockyards, whose location was most probably Gythium. The Athenians followed up this success by capturing the city of Chalcis on the Corinthian Gulf and then landing in the territory of Sicyon and defeating the Sicyonians in battle. The importance of Megara Modern scholars have emphasised the critical significance of Athenian control of Megara in enabling the early Athenian successes in the war. Megara provided a convenient port on the Corinthian Gulf, to which Athenian rowers could be transported overland, and a significant number of ships were probably kept at Megara's port of Pagae throughout the war.de Ste. Croix, Origins of the Peloponnesian War, 186‚Äì87 Moreover, while early modern scholars were sceptical of Athens' ability to prevent a Spartan army from moving through the Megarid, recent scholarship has concluded that the pass of Geraneia could have been held by a relatively small force.See de Ste. Croix, Origins of the Peloponnesian War, 190‚Äì96 and Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 80. Thus, with the isthmus of Corinth closed and Athenian fleets in both the Corinthian and Saronic gulfs, Attica was unassailable from the Peloponnese. The Spartans' inability to attack Megara proved to be a key component in their loss to the Athenians, but one scholar believes that the Spartans' inability to attack and control Megara was due to poor calculations and Athenian efforts to avoid an open land battle with the Spartans.A.J. Holladay, \\"Sparta and The First Peloponnesian War,\\" The Journal of Hellenistic Studies Vol. 105. (1985): 162. Athenian crisis and the truce Athens' remarkable string of successes came to a sudden halt in 454 BC, when its Egyptian expedition was finally crushingly defeated. A massive Persian army under Megabazus had been sent overland against the rebels in Egypt some time earlier, and upon its arrival had quickly routed the rebel forces. The Greek contingent had been besieged on the island of Prosopitis in the Nile. In 454 BC, after a siege of 18 months, the Persians captured the island, destroying the force almost entirely. Though the force that was obliterated was probably not as large as the 200 ships that had originally been sent, it was at least 40 ships with their full complements, a significant number of men.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 97. It was in 454 that the treasury of the Delian League, which Athens was head of, was moved from Delos to Athens. This change gave Athens greater control over the finances of the league, and a number of inscriptions survive showing who contributed to the wealth of the league and how much each city gave. Osborne and Rhodes' new book containing a great number of the inscriptions available from this period has one tribute list from 454/3 depicting the amount of tribute which Athens received from its allies and which it dedicated to Athena. The change in the location of the treasury is often pin-pointed as a focal point for the realisation of an Athenian empire. The disaster in Egypt severely shook Athenian control of the Aegean, and for some years afterwards the Athenians concentrated their attention on reorganising the Delian League and stabilising the region.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 98‚Äì102. The Athenians responded to a call for assistance from Orestes, the son of Echecratides, King of Thessaly, to restore him after he was exiled. Together with their Boeotian and Phocian allies, the Athenians marched to Pharsalus. They were not able to achieve their goals because of the Thessalian cavalry and were forced to return to Athens not having restored Orestes or captured Pharsalus. Therefore, in 451 BC, when Cimon returned to the city, his ostracism over, the Athenians were willing to have him negotiate a truce with Sparta.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 103. Cimon arranged a five-year truce,Diodorus Siculus, Library 11.86. and over the next several years Athens concentrated its efforts in the Aegean. After the truce The years after the truce were eventful ones in Greek politics. The Peace of Callias, if it existed, was concluded in 449 BC. It was probably in that same year that Pericles passed the Congress decree, calling for a pan-Hellenic congress to discuss the future of Greece.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 107‚Äì10. Modern scholars have debated extensively over the intent of that proposal; some regard it as a good faith effort to secure a lasting peace, while others view it as a propaganda tool.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 111‚Äì12. In any event, Sparta derailed the congress by refusing to attend.Plutarch, Pericles, 17.3 In the same year the Second Sacred War erupted, when Sparta detached Delphi from Phocis and rendered it independent. In 448 BC, Pericles led the Athenian army against Delphi, in order to reinstate Phocis to its former sovereign rights over the oracle of Delphi.Thucydides, I, 112.Plutarch, Pericles, XXI. In 447 BC a revolt broke out in Boeotia which was to spell the end of Athens' \\"continental empire\\" on the Greek mainland.K. Kuhlmann, Historical Commentary on the Peloponnesian War. Tolmides led an army out to challenge the Boeotians, but, after some early successes, was defeated at the Battle of Coronea. In the wake of this defeat, Pericles adopted a more moderate stance and Athens abandoned Boeotia, Phocis, and Locris. The defeat at Coronea, however, triggered a more dangerous disturbance, in which Euboea and Megara revolted. Pericles crossed over to Euboea with his troops to quash the rebellion there, but was forced to return when the Spartan army invaded Attica. Through negotiation and possibly bribery,Thucydides, II, 21.Aristophanes, The Acharnians, 832. Pericles persuaded the Spartan king Pleistoanax to lead his army home.Plutarch, Pericles, XXIII. Back in Sparta, Pleistoanax would later be prosecuted for failing to press his advantage, and fined so heavily that he was forced to flee into exile, unable to pay.Plutarch, Pericles, 22.3 With the Spartan threat removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea with 50 ships and 5,000 soldiers, crushing all opposition. He then inflicted a harsh punishment on the landowners of Chalcis, who lost their properties. The residents of Istiaia, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. The arrangement between Sparta and Athens was ratified by the \\"Thirty Years' Peace\\" (winter of 446‚Äì445 BC). According to this treaty, Megara was returned to the Peloponnesian League, Troezen and Achaea became independent, Aegina was to be a tributary to Athens but autonomous, and disputes were to be settled by arbitration. Each party agreed to respect the alliances of the other. Significance and aftermath The middle years of the First Peloponnesian War marked the peak of Athenian power. Holding Boeotia and Megara on land and dominating the sea with its fleet, the city had stood utterly secure from attack.Meiggs, The Athenian Empire, 111‚Äì12. The events of 447 BC and 446 BC, however, destroyed this position, and although not all Athenians gave up their dreams of unipolar control of the Greek world, the peace treaty that ended the war laid out the framework for a bipolar Greece.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 128‚Äì30. In return for abandoning her continental territories, Athens received recognition of her alliance by Sparta.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 128. The peace concluded in 445 BC, however, would last for less than half of its intended 30 years. In 431 BC, Athens and Sparta would go to war once again in the (second) Peloponnesian War, with decidedly more conclusive results.

The music was by Noel Gay and the song was originally sung by Flanagan and Allen accompanied by the Harry Bidgood orchestra. Background This song was written for Noel Gay's show The Little Dog Laughed, which opened on 11 October 1939, at a time when most of the major London theatres were closed. It was a popular song during World War II, especially after Flanagan and Allen changed the lyrics to poke fun at the Germans (e.g. Run Adolf, Run Adolf, Run, Run, Run........) The lyrics were used as a defiant dig at the allegedly ineffectual Luftwaffe. On 13 November 1939, soon after the outbreak of the Second World War and also soon after the song was premiered, Germany launched its first air raid on Britain, on flying boats that were sheltering in Sullom Voe, Shetland. Two rabbits were supposedly killed by a bomb drop, although it is suggested that they were in fact procured from a butchers' shop and used for publicity purposes.\\"The event made headline news across Britain and a photograph was taken of a man holding two dead rabbits at the site of the crater.

It was serialized from 2004 to 2007 in the manga magazine Princess and collected in ten volumes. It was licensed in North America by Go! Comi, with all volumes adapted by Mallory Reaves and edited by Brynne Chandler. The story is about Mashiro Ichijo, an intersex high-school student who is forced by a teacher to work out their gender identity in a collective dream, and Mashiro's romantic relationships with two classmates, one female and one male.  Plot  Mashiro Ichijo is a girls' idol, handsome and kind, but he has been hiding a secret all his life; he's not truly male, nor entirely female. He has the upper body of a male but the lower body of a female. When a mysterious school nurse introduces him to a new class, he finds that in order to graduate he has to go to a world of dreams to find a mysterious key, competing with other classmates to find it. Once this key is found, the student graduates and all other members of the school forget the finder's existence. As he struggles with his gender identity, he tries to decide whether he wants to live as a male and go out with one of the prettiest girls in school or as a female and be with the cute male slacker, both of whom are madly in love with Ichijo. The final chapter reveals that the whole story is an allegory for an outer story that was hinted at on the first page and then hinted at repeatedly during the course of the story:Author's afterword to volume 10. The school is connected to a ward of pregnant women and when a student graduates, they are born in the real world. Mashiro is reborn as a girl, whose twin brother died right before birth. In the epilogue, the real-world outcome for Kureha Fujishima, Ai Mizuhashi, and Ebizawa are shown ‚Äî dead. The story ends with the real-world Mashiro and Sou Mizuhashi meeting by coincidence when catching the same train to school.  Characters  All of the main and secondary characters take part in the dream class at some point during the story.  Main characters  ; : A high school student who is popular among his female classmates, even though he stays distant to protect a tremendous secret: he is neither fully a man nor a woman, as the upper half of his body is physically and genetically male while his lower half is female. Mashiro claims to identify himself as a man, however he is constantly doubting himself. He tries to act as he believes \\"men\\" commonly would. He is sometimes a member of the kendo club, quitting and rejoining a couple times over the series, in part in frustration at his inability to defeat Sou in a bout. When Kureha professes her love for him after learning of his secret, Mashiro begins to date her, even while remaining obsessed with Sou. :Dream Self: In the dream world Mashiro appears as himself in either a male or female school uniform, depending on his self-image at the moment. After finally embracing his identity and feelings, he appears fully as one gender. Occasionally, Mashiro creates two feather-shaped swords, a longer one representing his male side and a shorter one his female side. The two swords are connected, preventing him from discarding the short sword symbolizing that he cannot get rid of the female aspects of himself, much like he can't get rid of the short sword. The strength of the blades is determined by Mashiro's ability to essentially will them into sharpness. Later, when his two selves meet and fight, each holds one sword. Twice when Mashiro's belly is cut open while dreaming, a flock of black birds flies out, overwhelming his attacker. ; : She is cheery and bright, but has a strong dislike of men. Since Mashiro is very protective of her (and is not entirely male), Kureha soon falls for him. Kureha is very distrustful of Sou, and will take any opportunity to separate Mashiro and Sou. It is revealed in Chapter 2 (Mashiro's second dream in the class) that her distrust of men stems from a brutal rape done to her during a walk home from kindergarten, plus the harsh words she overheard her father say to her mother afterwards. However, as the story progresses, she and Sou team up and become friends, which is part of her plan to get revenge on Mashiro for their break-up. :Dream Self: In the dream world, Kureha appears dressed as she was after she was attacked, wearing a ragged raincoat and dripping with rain, her face and eyes concealed by the coat's hood because of shame and rage. She is very vengeful and quick to attack. Later in the sixth book she becomes a withered version of the tree that she and Mashiro sat under together, and later in volume eight, a knight after overcoming her difficulties. In that same volume she obtains the key to graduate, but chooses to not graduate. After she wakes the nurse asks her reason why, to which her response is she that wishes to see Mashiro graduate, even if that means she may have lost her own chance. ; : Coming off as an aloof womanizer, first seen dispassionately with a girl having sex with him, Sou merely has a blunt personality and genuinely tries to fall in love, albeit doing so through sex. Ever since he found out that Mashiro Ichijo was part woman, he has been trying anything to get Ichijo to love him, even going so far as to admit his love to him in the second volume. Sou has an older sister named Ai, whom he has very serious issues with. Ai and Sou's parents had separated when they were children, Ai going to live with their father and Sou with their mother. His mother spending more time on her career, Sou went to visit his sister. When he saw Ai playing with her step-mother and puppy and not the teddy bear that would be her \\"Sou\\", he ran away. Feeling betrayed that his sister seemingly moved on, he ended up catching pneumonia after collapsing in the rain. The series of events was so traumatic that he ended up seeing and hearing hallucinations. The illusions can affect him so strongly that he can see an entire room differently from someone else. :Dream Self: Sou's sister, Ai, tells Mashiro that Sou is the Black Knight that torments Mashiro, and later, Sou tells Mashiro that he was hiding behind the knight's armour. Volume nine sees Sou resolve his sister issues, and shows that up to that point Sou's dream self was partly the dream Ai, and partly her teddy bear, which supposedly represented \\"him\\" to her. After this, Sou's dream form becomes a dog friendly to Mashiro. ; : Sou's older sister, first seen in the dream world. She is dark with a slightly sadistic sense of humor. Ai also claims in volume two to know what happens after a student graduates. Ai actually attends a different school several blocks away, and only sneaked into the dream class to keep Sou from graduating. She has a strong brother complex, claiming she can only graduate once Sou has found the right girl to take care of him while also trying to keep him dependent on her. It is shown that they do have sexual relations with each other. However, it is revealed that the Ai seen so far was nothing more than a hallucination of Sou's mind that had developed after a near death experience. Afterward, Sou pushed his real sister away and they hadn't talking ever since. The real Ai's picture is shown during her funeral after she dies of a brain hemorrhage in volume 9. Instead of the straight hair with long pinned back bangs of Sou's mind, the actual Ai had wavy hair with straight edged bangs. :Dream Self: Ai takes the form of a young girl in Gothic Lolita style clothing and is almost always carrying a teddy bear. Wandering the dream world in lace and sometimes blood, she considers herself as the most important to the dream class. She has also proclaimed herself as the strongest dreamer in the class and displays a great deal of power to back it up. Ai takes this form because during her childhood is when she lost and regained Sou, and the teddy bear represents Sou. In the volume nine, she is revealed to be a ghost of sorts, a creation of Sou's mind to compensate for thinking that his real sister had betrayed him when he was young. Although he wishes to get rid of her, it seems Sou lacks the willpower to do so.  Secondary characters  ; Nurse : A mysterious nurse, whose name is never stated, who takes the students to the basement infirmary so they can take part in a special class on Thursdays. She knows all the new and old students' names and their \\"issues\\", like Ichijo's gender. The nurse also takes part in the memory loss when a student \\"graduates\\". Though not explicitly stated, the nurse is different for each student and takes the form of the students' mothers. This is hinted as the nurse for Kureha looks different from Ichijo's nurse as well as the fact that Ichijo's nurse looks exactly like Ichijo's mother except with lighter hair. The entrance to the basement infirmary is not accessible except to class members on Thursdays. ; : Midori takes part in the dream class. She was on the Beautification Committee and a straight-A student. As a model student, Midori strived to for R University. However, she believes that her actions and even her personality is simply an act. She gets rejected by the school and forced to apply to a different university, Midori felt that she had finally lost her true self. In the second volume Midori graduates when she hears her own breathing and realizes those are the proof of her being there. :Dream Self : Midori takes the form of herself but has an empty hole where her face is and a similar hole in her chest, showing how empty she feels on the inside. ; :Itsuki is a child prodigy, at age thirteen, who joins the dream class in the second volume. Itsuki takes Midori's place in the dream realm and graduates in the third volume. :Dream Self: In the dream world Itsuki takes the form of a paper giraffe, showing that he looks down on every one, even though he is weaker than them. He says he knows the real life identities of those he meets in the dream world. ; :Shinbashi has a crush on Kureha and has watched her from afar, but accepts that he could never be with her. After a mistake in the library has been cleared up, he and Mashiro become good friends. Mashiro tries to help Shinbashi and Kureha become friends, but it backfires and Kureha only gets angry. However, Kureha later asks Shinbashi for his phone number and calls him to talk about Mashiro. Shinbashi sets aside his own feelings to give both Kureha and Mashiro (separately) advice on their relationship. :Dream Self: He takes Itsuki's place in the dream realm in the fourth volume and graduates. He takes on the place of Mashiro's mobile phone. He also has the ability to feel the status of Kureha's dream self. ; :Asuka was a model earlier in life, but an accident scarred her face and injured her legs. She's now bound to a wheelchair and is both introduced and graduates in the 6th volume. :Dream Self: She takes on the form of a mermaid with a mask covering her eyes and the top half of her face. She appears weak when she first enters the dream without water around her, and is sitting in her wheelchair. She has a tiara and can apparently cut someone with her breath. ; :Ohara is a dreamer at the start of the series. She was the lurking hand with the continuous arm that stalk the shadows and fought with Kureha. Ohara never did graduate the class, she simply disappeared when she didn't attend class three times in a row. :Dream Self: She takes form of a hand and a continuously long arm. She has the ability to multiply into many little hands and arms or a giant one to crush her enemies away. ; :Mashiro and Sou's senpai in the Kendo club, he is portrayed as a very kind and understanding person. He serves as an 'agony aunt' to Mashiro. However, he is revealed to be the son of the president of an important company, and his outside personality is nothing more than what his father and mother wanted him to be. :Dream Self: It is later revealed that he, and not Sou, is the Black Knight.

When she began to develop it as a manga, she moved the setting to a high school, changing the sleeping pods the characters used for shared dreaming into canopied beds. The characters Itsuki Shinonome and Asuka Suo were supposed to be part of the initial class of dreamers with Mashiro, but after serialization was announced in Princess as a horror story, Mizushiro put off introducing them because she thought their dream forms of a giraffe and mermaid were too gentle for an atmosphere of horror.  Release  After School Nightmare was written and illustrated by Setona Mizushiro. It was serialized in the monthly manga magazine Princess, beginning in the July 2004 issue, released on 5 June 2004, and concluding in the December 2007 issue, released on 6 November 2007. The 39 untitled chapters were collected in ten volumes by Akita Shoten under the Princess Comics imprint. It was licensed to be adapted into English in North America by Go! Comi, with all volumes published before the imprint shut down in 2010. It is also licensed in France by Asuka, in Italy by Star Comics, and in Germany by Carlsen Verlag.  Reception  In 2007, After School Nightmare was nominated for an Eisner Award in the category \\"Best U.S. Edition of International Material ‚Äì Japan\\". The English edition of After School Nightmare was named by the Young Adult Library Services Association as among the 10 best graphic novels for teens for 2008.

He is a right- handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. He made his Derbyshire first team debut in 2006, having spent two years in the second team. Having first appeared (and finished not-out) in a Second XI Trophy match, marred by a 12-run penalty award to Derbyshire which handed them a match victory by one wicket, he later appeared in his debut first-team match against Essex, a match which he played on the same day as he was supposed to be receiving his A-level results. An off-spinner, he has proven slightly expensive in his rookie season, though this is perhaps to be expected from such a young character. Jake has recently been given a new two-year contract, seeing him stay at the county until at least 2010. In October 2007, Needham traveled to Victoria, Australia, where he has accepted a one-season contract to play for club cricket side St. Mary's during the English Winter. In May 2012, he retired from professional cricket after asking to be released from the final year of his contract with Derbyshire. The county have accepted his request, ending Needham's six-year stay. He is still involved in club cricket at the highest level however and has been appointed captain of Ockbrook and Borrowash, who play in the Derbyshire Premier League in place of Kevin Dean, another Ex- Derbyshire player.

He was elected following the death of his father Paraire Karaka Paikea who had been the MP, and he held the parliamentary seat until his own death in 1963. Early life A foundation pupil of the Ratana Pa school, Paikea started work in the Native Affairs Ministry. He led the Ratana Morehu Brass Band, and organised the special train which took the Ratana followers from the Tai Tokerau area in the Far North to Ratana for the annual festivals. Political career Paikea was elected to replace his father at the 1943 general election on 24 September 1943. A by- election was to have been held on 19 June 1943, with two candidates, Paikea and Mr Samuel W. Maioha of Russell. But when the government announced a September general election, the requirement to hold a by-election was then avoided by a special Act of Parliament; the By-elections Postponement Act 1943, passed on 11 June 1943. Paikea promoted Ratana and Maori issues. His maiden speech covered the economic and social contribution of the Maori war effort, Maori cultural pride and equal treatment for Maori and Pakeha. As a Member of Parliament for the Far North and based in Auckland, Paikea had a special emphasis for Tai Tokerau land claims and the needs of Maori moving to the city. He remained a Member of Parliament for Northern Maori until his own death on 7 January 1963. NotesReferences * Henderson, James Mcleod (1963). Ratana The Man, The Church, The Movement (1st ed.)

The success of landfill diversion can be measured by comparison of the size of the landfill from one year to the next. If the landfill grows minimally or remains the same, then policies covering landfill diversion are successful. For example, currently in the United States there are 3000 landfills. A measure of the success of landfill diversion would be if that number remains the same or is reduced. In 2009, it was recorded that the national average of landfill diversion in the United States was 33.8%, while San Francisco had implemented the most effective policies and had recorded a landfill diversion rate of 77%. A landfill operation in Perth, Western Australia. Waste diversion Waste diversion is the process of diverting waste from landfills through recycling and source reduction activities. This can be calculated in different ways. As a global community, we can measure the size and number of landfills from one year to the next. If the landfills have shrunk or decreased in number, then it can be gathered that we are successfully implementing a waste diversion plan. If landfills have increased in number, then we are not doing enough to combat the growing population and growing waste we produce. On a smaller scale, we can track our week to week, or even day to day, waste diversion rate. Types of landfill diversion=Waste reduction Reduction of waste is another way to divert waste from landfills; not creating waste in the first place will reduce the amount of waste going to landfills. There are numerous ways to reduce waste, for example, consumers can avoid single use products and instead invest in re- usable items such as canvas bags instead of plastic bags; consuming less in general is also an effective way to reduce waste. In addition, maintaining vehicles' tires will also help reduce waste tires in landfills since they are undesirable and take up too much space along with many other negative effects.  Recycling  Landfill diversion can occur through recycling. Recycling refers to taking used materials and creating new products in order to prevent the disposal of these products in landfills. Recycling material can include glass, paper, metal, plastic, textiles, and electronics. Recycle Plastic Bird Thermal treatment Another method of landfill diversion is thermal treatment (such as Incineration). Approximately sixteen percent (16%) of waste is incinerated yearly in the United States. Incineration, however, can lead to other environmental issues that may have positive or negative results. Biological treatments In addition to reusing materials waste products can go through biological treatment. There are two types of biological treatments anaerobic digestion or composting. Simply stated, biological treatment is the breaking down of material through the action of micro- organisms. Materials are broken down to carbon dioxide, water and biomass. Biomass consists of wood, crops, yard and animal waste. Biomass is considered a renewable energy because more can be grown in a short amount of time. Biomass contributes to roughly four percent of our energy. Biomass energy although its burned, does not pollute the air as much as fossil fuels. Some materials easily break down, others do not. The environment in which the material is placed determines the speed of breakdown. Return waste to supplier of original materials It is possible in many production facilities to return waste product to the supplier of the original raw material. Some examples include the reuse of beer kegs by returning to the distributor to be refilled, reuse of propane tanks, and recycling batteries to be used again. These products are large contributors to the overgrowth of landfills. Many companies will offer incentives or credits for the returned product towards the next purchase. Reuse waste in the same or other steps of production process The development of more closed loop systems aides in diverting waste from landfills. Manufacturing and most production facilities will create waste to varying degrees. A closed loop system will recycle the waste back into the production process to maintain minimal levels of waste that is left to be disposed of. This is environmentally and economically friendly. Industry park H√∂chst - waste-to-energy plant - Industriepark H√∂chst - M√ºllverbrennungsanlage - 07 Selling waste to a third party More unfamiliar than other types, it is possible for a company to sell its waste to a third party. This third party will purchase the waste for reuse in their own production process. In addition to the sale of waste, there are also third parties which will retrieve your waste for you if they are capable of disposing of it more efficiently and/or affordably. Waste to energy Other options for diversion are composting and waste-to-energy: converting primary waste into various types of energy such as heat or electricity. Types of landfills=Open dump An open dump is an area where unwanted waste is disposed of with no regulations or restrictions; they often produce adverse effects on the environment. The Resources Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 prohibited open dumping, therefore making it illegal in many states. Sanitary landfill A sanitary landfill is where waste is disposed of in thin layers little by little; each layer is covered and compacted with soil to prevent foul odors and wind blown litter. This method prevents the creation of safety and public health hazards; this landfill has four requirements before it is built. The first requirement is that it must have absolute leachate security; the bottom of the landfill can be lined, synthetically or with soil, to prevent water contamination. Secondly, there must be formal engineering preparations and plannings in order to ensure the success of the landfill. Thirdly, permanent supervision must be present in all stages of the landfill also to ensure success and sustainability. Lastly, the placement and compacting of waste must be planned to prevent pest and vermin infestations. Secure landfill A secure landfill is where hazardous waste is deposited since it requires a much more stringent regulation than municipal waste. The landfill must have at least two impermeable liners as well as a system for leachate collection to prevent any water contamination. In addition to this, the landfill must also have a groundwater monitoring system in case there is a leak; the wells can be pumped to remove the contaminated water for treatment. =Deep-well injection= Deep-well injection is a form of disposing of liquid hazardous waste. The liquid waste is pumped into porous limestone or sandstone through a steel casing, and high pressure is applied in order to permanently store the waste within the pores and fissures of the rocks. The limestone or sandstone used for injection must be located beneath an impermeable layer of clay or rock at least 0.5 mile below the surface. This option generally does not require pre-treatment of the waste and is one of the more inexpensive options, however it poses a risk of hazardous waste leakage.  Legislation =US California = The California Integrated Waste Management Act mandated all Californian cities and counties to divert 25% of their solid waste by 1990 and 50% by 2000 through planning and programs; this is managed by the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle), and they also provide assistance in creating plans and programs. The percentage of solid waste required to be diverted has remained at 50% each year. =Maryland= The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) promotes the idea of waste diversion by partnering with Maryland's jurisdictions as well as the public and private sectors. All counties and Baltimore City are required to recycle 15% of waste generated (populations under 150,000) or 20% (populations over 150,000) due to The Maryland Recycling Act (MRA); the state government is also required to recycle at least 20% of their solid waste. =Pennsylvania= The Municipal Waste Planning Recycling and Waste Reduction Act (Act 101) was passed in 1988 which first initiated a statewide recycling program in Pennsylvania. As of 2016, at least 94% of Pennsylvania residents had access to recycling while 79% of the same population have direct access through curb side pick up programs. This act also required that individual counties develop efficient plans to combat the waste which will need disposed of in the next 10+ years.http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Land/Waste/Recycling/Pages/default.aspx#.Vikxb03D-Uk Success of Pennsylvania's recycling programs can be seen in the numbers. Over 6.12 million tons of waste were recycled into resources in 2013. This amount of recycling constitutes to 7.5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions that were diverted from entering the air. The amount of carbon dioxide that this single state reduced in one year is equivalent to taking 1.58 million vehicles off of the road for one full year.http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Land/Waste/Recycling/Pages/default.aspx#.Vikxb03D-Uk Europe European waste legislation focuses upon the diversion of biodegradable waste from landfill, due to its potential to add to the effects of climate change.http://www.recyclecddebris.com/rCDd/Resources/Documents/CSIEurope01.pdf Waste diversion rate Calculating waste diversion rates is an important tool for households and especially businesses to use. It is a KPI in indicating a successful recycling program. By tracking progress weekly, changes can be made to improve week to week. A simple formula is used to calculate the waste diversion rate, as follows: (Weight of Recycling / (Weight of Recycling + Weight of Garbage)) X 100 Waste should be labeled with the name of the area in which they were received. For businesses, this will be helpful in implementing programs; what may work for one part of the company may not work for another. The goal is to calculate a number as close to one hundred as possible. This would imply that one hundred percent of your waste is recycled. If a lower number is calculated, changes are required to improve the score. When a need to change the recycling plan is recognized, you must effectively communicate the plan to all members involved to make sure it is implemented in full. After the plan is implemented, try measuring the waste diversion rate again. Measure the changes to see if the new plan has produced clear benefits. Waste diversion validation The UL is a global independent safety science company which is working to find and improve current technologies and the public use of these things. They work to innovate the usage to promote a world where these luxuries and a healthy environment can co-inhabit the planet. They are three different levels of validations which the UL uses to honor the companies who manage their waste in environmentally healthy ways. Facilities are recognized as \\"Zero Waste\\" if they can consistently measure at a waste diversion rate of 100 percent. Facilities which are granted \\"Virtually Zero,\\" maintain a waste diversion rate of 98 percent or higher. If facilities can manage to keep a waste diversion rate of 80 percent or higher, they are recognized as operating with landfill waste diversion. Zero waste Full article on Zero Waste  What does it mean to operate at zero waste?  A zero waste system is one which redesigns the traditional production system. Rather than using natural resources which are scarce, it promotes the reuse of waste to create new products. This process continues endlessly, constantly making product from the waste created by the last production process.http://www.ecocycle.org/zerowaste A zero waste system A zero waste society will be led by motivated citizens. Responsible policies must be enacted which will provide regulations to follow to achieve zero waste. Regulations and closed loop manufacturing systems will create a clean and efficient manufacturing process. Programs will be enacted locally to promote education and awareness over the importance of operating at zero waste and ways to effectively do so. Even after a zero waste production process is created, there is still remaining waste that must be properly disposed of. This requires recovery infrastructure. This infrastructure would look to replace landfills. It has a potential to recover upwards of 90% of waste that has entered and is present in landfills to date.http://www.ecocycle.org/zerowaste See also * Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme * Landfill tax References Waste management concepts ","title":"Landfill diversion"},{"id":"6328160","text":"Alexandre \\"Alex\\" F√†bregas i Carn√© (born 25 October 1980 in Barcelona, Spain) is a former Spanish field hockey player who played for the Spain national team as midfielder.

The editor-in-chief is Kenneth T. Christensen (University of Notre Dame).  History  The journal was established in 1923 as the Journal of Scientific Instruments. The first issue was introduced by J. J. Thomson, then president of the Institute of Physics, who stated that no publication existed at that time in the English language specially devoted to scientific instruments. The idea for the journal was promoted by Richard Glazebrook, the first president, then director, of the National Physical Laboratory, where the journal was initially edited. The need for interdisciplinarity was recognised even then, with the desire to co-opt biologists, engineers, chemists, and instrument makers, \\"as well as physicists\\", on the scientific advisory committee. The Institute of Physics merged with the Physical Society of London in 1960. By this time the Proceedings of the Physical Society had grown in size and the quality of the applied journals, British Journal of Applied Physics and Journal of Scientific Instruments, had been improved. In 1968 these journals were merged to form part of the Journal of Physics series of journals, A to E, the fifth journal in the series being Journal of Physics E: Scientific Instruments. In 1990 the journal was renamed as Measurement Science and Technology to reflect the shift away from many scientists making their own instruments.

The language name is both an acronym meaning 'Higher-order Unified Meta-Environment' and an honorific to the 18th Century philosopher David Hume. It targets real-time embedded systems, aiming to produce a design that is both highly abstract, yet which will still allow precise extraction of time and space execution costs. This allows programmers to guarantee the bounded time and space demands of executing programs. Hume combines functional programming ideas with ideas from finite state automata. Automata are used to structure communicating programs into a series of \\"boxes\\", where each box maps inputs to outputs in a purely functional way using high-level pattern-matching. It is structured as a series of levels, each of which exposes different machine properties.  The Hume Design Model  The Hume language design attempts to maintain the essential properties and features required by the embedded systems domain (especially for transparent time and space costing) whilst incorporating as high a level of program abstraction as possible. It aims to target applications ranging from simple micro-controllers to complex real-time systems such as smartphones. This ambitious goal requires incorporating both low-level notions such as interrupt handling, and high-level ones of data structure abstraction etc. Of course such systems will be programmed in widely differing ways, but the language design should accommodate these varying requirements. Hume is a three-layer language: an outer (static) declaration/metaprogramming layer, an intermediate coordination layer describing a static layout of dynamic processes and the associated devices, and an inner layer describing each process as a (dynamic) mapping from patterns to expressions. The inner layer is stateless and purely functional. Rather than attempting to apply cost modeling and correctness proving technology to an existing language framework either directly or by altering a more general language (as with e.g. RTSJ), the approach taken by the Hume designers is to design Hume in such a way that formal models and proofs can definitely be constructed. Hume is structured as a series of overlapping language levels, where each level adds expressibility to the expression semantics, but either loses some desirable property or increases the technical difficulty of providing formal correctness/cost models.  Characteristics  The interpreter and compiler versions differ a bit. * the interpreter (concept prover) admits timeout and custom exceptions. * the compiler admits heap and stack cost bounding but exceptions only print the exception name. The coordination system wires boxes in a dataflow programming style. The expression language is Haskell-like. The message passing concurrency system remembers JoCaml's Join patterns or Polyphonic C Sharp chords, but with all channels asynchronous. There is a scheduler built-in that continuously checks pattern-matching through all boxes in turn, putting on hold the boxes that cannot copy outputs to busy input destinations.

The investigations on Maƒèaro≈° hill also revealed a settlement from the Bronze Age. Several items from the Iron Age and the Roman imperial period were discovered as well. In historical records, the village was first mentioned in 1156 when Martirius, the archbishop of Esztergom, donated church lands in 70 villages to the Esztergom canonry in order to improve the economic welfare of the canons. One the villages of the archdeaconry was \\"villa Alexu\\"- known today as Alek≈°ince. A deed of donation from 1275 by the king Ladislaus IV of Hungary lists the first owner: knight Deuse, who died during a Tatar invasion in 1241‚Äì1242. In this deed, the village appears under the name of Elekchy. Coat of arms Since the 18th century, the official seal has been in use. The seal depicts a female figure with an aureole, Saint Anne, the patron saint of the village. On June 18, 1996, the local council authorized the coat of arms and an official village seal and flag. The coat of arms is a heraldic stylization of Saint Anne, who is usually depicted as a woman carrying a child and a book (Saint Anne was the mother of Virgin Mary). The book in the coat of arms represents the Old Testament, that promises the arrival of the Messiah, which Saint Anne uses to teach her daughter. The lily symbolizes the virginity of Mary. In Christian tradition, the combination of the two symbols is used exclusively for Saint Anne. The colour combination is determined by green as the main colour associated with Saint Anne. The book is yellow (golden) and the lily is white (gray). Alek≈°ince's coat of arms therefore depicts a green field with silver lily over a closed golden book.

The district was fully racially integrated in 1968. Elementary schools began to be integrated before 1965. In 1965, students from non-white schools were allowed to apply to attend Huntsville High School instead of the non-white high school, Samuel W. Houston High School.

It is a localization of the Japanese Mark III game, , based on the manga and anime series of the same name (which would later be published as Fist of the North Star in English). The export version was released without the Hokuto no Ken license, forcing graphic alterations to the game. Black Belt was one of programmer Yuji Naka's early games prior to his involvement in Sonic the Hedgehog. Plot and gameplay The player takes control of a martial artist named Riki, who sets out to rescue his girlfriend Kyoko from his rival, Wang. The game is composed of six left-to-right side- scrolling stages in which Riki faces different types of underlings (depending on the stage), facing the occasional sub-boss at midpoints of certain stages. Keeping true to the original source material Hokuto no Ken, underlings violently explode upon being punched or kicked. At the end of each stage, Riki must confront the stage's boss, each being susceptible to only one type of attack. The player must exploit their opponent's weakness and use it to finish the boss off. Release The Japanese original was based on Hokuto no Ken. Black Belt was originally a Hokuto no Ken game in Japan. The character and backgrounds were changed during localization to remove all ties to the property. The game's third boss, which was originally a battle with a much larger opponent, was also changed to a normal boss battle in Black Belt. However, the game mechanics are still the same and even the lesser enemies die by exploding into bits, which caused the game to be banned from sale to those under age 18 in Germany until 2012.http://www.master-system.info/indiziert.htm A sequel was released for the Mega Drive in Japan, which was released internationally as Last Battle, once again stripped of the Hokuto no Ken license. In Japan, a remake of Hokuto no Ken featuring 3D polygonal graphics was released for the PlayStation 2 on March 25, 2004 as the 11th entry in Sega's Sega Ages 2500 line, with an emulation of the original version included as a bonus. The original Master System version was digitally re-released in Japan for the Wii via the Virtual Console service on February 26, 2008. The game can also be unlocked for play in the 2018 title Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise. The western release of Lost Paradise retains the original Japanese release of Hokuto no Ken rather than its western Black Belt counterpart.

There are millions of waste pickers worldwide, predominantly in developing countries, but increasingly in post-industrial countries as well. Forms of waste picking have been practiced since antiquity, but modern traditions of waste picking took root during industrialization in the nineteenth century. Over the past half-century, waste picking has expanded vastly in the developing world due to urbanization, toxic colonialism and the global waste trade. Many cities only provide solid waste collection. Terminology Many terms are used to refer to people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or personal consumption. In English, these terms include rag picker, reclaimer, informal resource recoverer, binner, recycler, poacher, salvager, scavenger, and waste picker; in Spanish cartonero, chatarrero, pepenador, clasificador, minador and reciclador; and in Portuguese catador de materiais recicl√°veis. A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is \\"informal sector recycling\\". However, the word \\"informal\\" can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered. In 2008, participants of the First World Conference of Waste Pickers chose to use the term \\"waste picker\\" for English usage to facilitate global communication. The term ‚Äúscavenger‚Äù is also commonly used, but many waste pickers find it demeaning due to the implied comparison with animals. A waste picker is different from a waste collector because the waste collected by the latter may be destined for a landfill or incinerator, not necessarily for a recycling facility. \\"Dumpster diving\\" generally refers to the practice of anti-consumer and freegan activists who reclaim items such as food and clothes from the waste stream as a form of protest against consumer culture. ‚ÄúWaste picking‚Äù generally refers to activity motivated purely by economic need. Prevalence and demographics There is little reliable data about the number and demographics of waste pickers worldwide. Most academic research on waste pickers is qualitative rather than quantitative. Systematic large-scale data collection is difficult due to the profession's informal nature, porous borders, seasonally fluctuating workforce, and widely dispersed and mobile worksites. Also, many researchers are reluctant to produce quantitative data out of fear that it might be used to justify crackdowns on waste picking by authorities. Thus, the large-scale estimates that do exist are mainly extrapolations based on very small original research samples. In his book, \\"The World's Scavengers\\" (2007), Martin Medina provides a methodological guide to researching waste picking. In 1988, the World Bank estimated that 1‚Äì2% of the global population subsists by waste picking. A 2010 study estimates that there are 1.5 million waste pickers in India alone. Brazil, the country that collects the most robust official statistics on waste pickers, estimates that nearly a quarter million of its citizens engage in waste picking. Waste picker incomes vary vastly by location, form of work, and gender. Some waste pickers live in extreme poverty, but many others earn multiple times their country's minimum wage. Recent studies indicate that waste pickers in Belgrade, Serbia, earn approximately US$3 per day, while waste pickers in Cambodia typically earn $1 per day. Official statistics in Brazil indicate that men earn more than women, regardless of age. Approximately two thirds of Brazil's waste pickers are men overall, but this proportion jumps to 98% in high income waste picker groups (those earning between 3‚Äì4 times the minimum wage). No women were found in the highest income groups (those earning over 10 times the minimum wage). Causes=In developing countries Over the past half century, in- country migration and increased fertility rates have caused the population of cities in the developing world to mushroom. The global population of urban dwellers is expected to double between 1987 and 2015, with 90% of this growth occurring in developing countries. Much of the new population has settled in urban slums and squatter settlements, which have expanded rapidly with no central planning. The United Nations Habitat Report found that nearly one billion people worldwide live in slums, about a third of the world's urban dwellers. The rapid urbanization greatly increased the demand for informal waste collecting services, as cities lacked the infrastructure and resources to collect the totality of wastes generated by their inhabitants. Despite spending 30‚Äì50% of operation budgets on waste management, developing world cities today collect only 50‚Äì80% of refuse generated by inhabitants. Residents and businesses often resort to burning garbage or disposing of it in streets, rivers, vacant lots, and open dumps. This is a source of air, land, and water pollution that threatens human health and the environment. Informal waste collectors help mitigate this harm by collecting recyclable materials by foot or in pushcarts, tricycles, donkey carts, horse carts, and pickup trucks. On the supply side, urbanization has facilitated the expansion of waste picking by creating a large pool of unemployed and underemployed residents with few alternative means of earning a livelihood. Known as ‚Äúthe one industry that is always hiring,‚Äù waste picking provides a cushion for many who lose their jobs during times of war, crisis, and economic downturn in countries that do not have welfare systems. It is also one of the few work opportunities available to people who lack formal education or job experience. In post-industrial countries Though documentation exists of rag pickers and scrap metal collectors supplying goods to paper mills and foundries as early as the 17th century, modern waste picking did not flourish in the US and Europe until the 19th century. Just as in the developing world, the combination of industrialization and urbanization led to three trends which favored the blossoming of the informal waste collecting industry: increased generation of urban waste, increased demand for raw materials from industry, and increased numbers of urban dwellers in need of livelihoods. In that era, waste pickers were known as wharf rats, tinkers, rag and bone men, mudlarks, and ragpickers. By the mid-20th century waste picking decreased, as waste management industries were formalized, and welfare states decreased the poor's reliance on informal recycling. Beginning in the mid-1990s, however, informal recycling in parts of the United States and Western Europe once again began to mushroom. Two factors fueled the boom: First, the demand for recycling surged due to the increased waste stream, declining room in landfills, new recycling technologies, and the efforts of environmentalists. In 1985 only one roadside recycling program existed in the United States. By 1998, there were 9,000 such programs and 12,000 recyclable drop-off centers. Laws were passed in some states making it illegal not to recycle. Second, changes in the political economy including the loss of manufacturing jobs, cutbacks to government employment, and the roll back of the welfare state increased the ranks of the poor, working poor, and homeless‚Äîthus there were more people disposed to wastepick as a full-time profession or supplemental job. American waste pickers predominantly collect cans, bottles, and cardboard. Many immigrants work as waste pickers because language and documentation barriers limit their opportunities to work elsewhere. Many homeless people also work as waste pickers‚Äîsome describe it as their only alternative to panhandling. Some recyclers use vans to increase their yield while others work on foot with carts. Anecdotal evidence suggests that most American waste pickers are male, as waste picking is widely considered too dirty and strenuous a job for women. During an ethnography of homeless recyclers in San Francisco, sociologist Teresa Gowan claims to have met hundreds of male waste pickers, but only four female waste pickers. Costs and benefits=Social and ecological benefits A scavenger in Hong Kong pours water onto the paper she has collected in order to increase her profit by adding to its weight. Waste picking offers significant ecological, economic, and social benefits: * Job creation: Waste picking provides a source of livelihood to extremely poor people with few other employment opportunities. Though many waste pickers practice their trade as a full-time profession, its flexible hours make it accessible to women with other care responsibilities and to people looking to supplement income from other jobs. During times of need, waste picking serves as a safety net to street children, orphans, the elderly, widows, migrants, the disabled, the unemployed, and victims of armed conflicts. Waste picking also benefits the broader economy by supplying raw materials to industry and creating many associated jobs for middlemen who purchase, sort, process, and resell materials collected by waste pickers. * Public health and sanitation: Waste pickers collect garbage from neighborhoods that lack public services. Without waste pickers, residents would be forced to burn trash, or dispose of it in rivers, streets and empty lots. Waste pickers provide the only solid waste removal service in many cities. * Municipal savings: Waste pickers provide between 50 and 100% of waste collecting services in most cities of the developing world, according to a 2010 UN Habitat report. This is effectively serves as a mass subsidy for city governments, who do not pay for the labor. Moreover, recycling expands the lifespan of city dumps and landfills. * Reducing pollution and mitigating climate change: By cutting the quantity of virgin materials needed for production, waste pickers save room in landfills, lessen water and energy consumption, reduce air and water pollution, and abate climate change. Since 2009, international delegations of waste pickers have attended at least five global climate change conferences to demand that climate funds invest in resource recovery programs that will help ensure waste pickers‚Äô livelihoods, rather than waste disposal technologies like incinerators. Social costs Waste pickers not only generate social benefits, but also potential costs as well. These include: * Occupational hazards: See discussion below. * Child labor: Children commonly work as waste pickers. This may interfere with their education, or harm their physical, emotional, and social well-being. * Litter: Waste pickers working on streets sometimes spread waste from trash bags, sullying the sidewalk and creating more work for city street sweepers. * Public nuisance: Many people view waste pickers as a nuisance or source of shame for their communities. Waste pickers' perceived poverty and lack of sanitation makes some people uncomfortable or fearful. In developing countries especially, many argue that modern services should replace waste pickers. * Pilfering of public property: In some cities, waste pickers have been known to steal, meltdown, and resell public property such as telephone electrical copper wires, steel fence, or manhole coverings. Occupational hazards Health risks = There is a high prevalence of disease among waste pickers due to their exposure to hazardous materials such as fecal matter, paper saturated by toxic materials, bottles and containers with chemical residues, contaminated needles, and heavy metals from batteries. A study in Mexico City found the average lifespan of a dumpsite waste collector to be 39 years, compared to the national average of 69 years, though a later World Bank study estimated life span to be 53 years. In Port Said, Egypt, a 1981 study showed an infant mortality rate of 1/3 among waste pickers (one out of three babies dies before reaching age one). = Risks of injury = Among the most common types of job-related injuries for waste pickers are back and hand injuries caused by lifting heavy objects with little equipment. In a study of 48 waste pickers in Santo Andr√©, Brazil, almost all workers reported pain in the back, legs, shoulder, arms, and hands. Waste pickers who work in open dumps are exposed to large amounts of toxic fumes, and face other severe threats including being run over by trucks and caught in surface subsidence, trash slides, and fires. On 10 July 2000, several hundred waste pickers were killed by a trash slide from a huge garbage mountain after monsoon rains at an open dump in Payatas, Philippines. = Stigma, harassment, and violence = Most waste picking activity is illegal or unpermitted, so waste pickers commonly face harassment by police and authorities. Also, there is widespread public scorn against waste pickers due to their poverty and perceived lack of hygiene. Women are subject to greater harassment, particularly sexual harassment due to their low social status and lack of social support. One of the most extreme manifestations of such stigma occurs in Colombia, where, since the 1980s, \\"social cleansing\\" vigilante groups, sometimes working with police complicity, have killed at least two thousand waste collectors, beggars, and prostitutes‚Äîwhom they refer to as \\"disposables\\" (desechables). In 1992, around the peak of this activity, eleven corpses of murdered waste collectors were discovered at a university in Barranquilla. Their organs had been sold for transplants and bodies sold to the medical school for dissection (Medina 2009, 155). Waste picker organizing Traditionally, scholars assumed that informal workers such as waste pickers could not collectively organize due to structural barriers such as lack of legal protection, widely dispersed worksites, porous borders to their profession, a culture of independence and individualism, lack of institutional experience, and lack of money and time to build organizations. Nonetheless, in recent decades waste pickers across Latin America, Asia, and Africa have begun collectively organizing to win a place within formal recycling systems. Waste pickers use many organizational formats including cooperatives, associations, companies, unions, and micro-enterprises. Despite the differences in format, most of these organizations share three primary purposes. First, by pooling capital, establishing microenterprises, and forming partnerships with business and government, waste collectors increase their selling power. Second, by securing uniforms, safety equipment, and work permits, cooperatives increase workplace dignity and safety. And third, by demanding recognition and compensation from the state for their environmental and economic contributions, cooperatives increase members‚Äô political might. These three functions‚Äîpolitical influence, workplace dignity and safety, and increased earnings‚Äîare mutually reinforcing, like legs on a stool. Some waste pickers have created \\"women‚Äôs only\\" organizations, which seek to combat gender-based discrimination at worksites and in communities. A study in Brazil indicates that women are heavily overrepresented even in coed organizations, making up 56% of the membership despite the fact that they represent only a third of the total waste picking population. Beginning in the 1990s, waste picker organizations in many parts of the world began uniting into regional, national, and transnational coalitions to increase their political voice and economic leverage. In March 2008, delegates from 30 countries gathered in Bogot√°, Colombia, for the first World Conference (and Third Latin American Conference) of Waste Pickers (WIEGO 2008). One of the key issues discussed was the global trend of privatization and concentration of waste management systems. Normally, privatization is thought of as the handover of government functions to the private sector, but in this case, privatization often means the transference of services formerly provided by informal waste collectors to private firms. As waste streams have expanded due to increased consumption, the waste management industry is becoming increasingly lucrative. Governments around the world are granting private companies monopolies on waste management systems, meaning that the cooperatives‚Äô survival hinges on building political and economic alliances needed to win contracts‚Äîoften an uphill battle given authorities‚Äô distrust of waste collectors and the cooperatives‚Äô lack of capital for modern machinery. Organizing in Latin America In 1962, the first known Latin American waste picker's organization, Cooperativa Antioque√±a de Recolectores de Subproductos, was created in Medell√≠n, Colombia. The Colombian waste pickers movement did not emerge as a veritable political force until 1990, however, when four cooperatives who had been fighting the closure of a landfill united as the Waste Collector's Association of Bogot√° (ARB). Today the ARB is one of the world's most active and established waste picker organizations. In 2013, the Goldman Environmental Prize was awarded to Nohra Padilla (representing the ARB) for her contribution to waste management and recycling in Colombia. Throughout the 1990s, powerful waste collectors associations began to form in other Latin American countries as well‚Äîmost notably in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. In 2005, Brazil hosted the first meeting of the Latin American Waste Picker Network (LAWPN)‚Äîan organization that now represents waste pickers movements from 16 countries. LAWPN has four key functions. First, it facilitates exchanges of knowledge, technology, and strategies between member organizations through regional conventions, country-to-country delegations, telecommunications, and strategic reports. Second, it organizes transnational solidarity to aid in local battles. For example, when waste pickers in Montevideo, Uruguay, needed support in a local campaign, member organizations across Latin America issued solidarity statements and pressured their national ambassadors in Uruguay to do the same. Third, LAWPN sends leaders from countries with strong waste picker movements to countries with weak movements in order to promote the development of new leadership and organizations. Fourth, LAWPN organizes global waste picker committees to make appeals for support to transnational governance organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank, the UN Convention on Climate Change, and the International Labour Organization. In Argentina, The Movement of Excluded Workers (excluded in the sense that their work is not recognized by the government and they are excluded from receiving rights) is the largest waste pickers organization. It is a social organization, independent from political parties, which brings together more than 2,000 cartoneros (waste picker) in Capital Federal and the suburbs, specifically in the neighborhoods of Lan√∫s and Lomas de Zamora. After years of sacrifice and struggle, they managed to improve their working conditions. They have established a more logistical system‚Äîthey no longer travel by hanging off of trucks, they have obtained a work incentive and uniforms, and lastly they have founded a nursery for 160 children, some of whom worked in the past as cartoneros. However, they still have to advance in designing a social security program that includes all the cartoneros of Buenos Aires. Additionally, they have to raise awareness among residents of the city to separate their trash so that they can collect door to door, without having direct contact with wet materials. Organizing in Asia India is home to Asia's largest waste picker movement. Self-Employed Women's Association of India, a trade union that exclusively organizes women in the informal economy and has membership of over one million, began organizing waste pickers in the late 1970s. SEWA has created nearly ninety waste pickers cooperatives, which members use to gain collective work contracts and access to credit, training, and markets. One of Asia's largest waste picker associations is The Alliance of Indian Waste Pickers (AIW), a national network of 35 organizations in 22 cities. The AIW facilitates peers support, advocacy and cross-learning among waste pickers, iterant buyers, and support NGOs. Also in India, the All India Kabari Mazdoor Mahasangh (AIKMM) is locked in a battle with the New Delhi Municipal Council, which closed a deal with the Hyderabad-based company, Ramky Energy and Environment Ltd to manage the waste, in effect criminalising the work of more than 100,000 unorganised waste pickers that currently sort about 20% of Delhi's garbage. The EJOLT project made a video on what they call the Delhi waste war. Waste pickers in Thailand have also organized, including the Khon Kaen scavengers. In Delhi, the NGO Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group makes the work of waste pickers safer (by providing gloves and mouth masks) and it also provides for a steady source of income (by paying a monthly wage to the waste pickers).E-Waste Pickers Now Have a Dignified, Safe and ‚ÄòGreen‚Äô Job!Chintan: what we do An Indian waste pickers union known as KKPKP recently carried out a mapping initiative to identify organizations of or that work with waste pickers across the continent‚Äîa first step towards the development an Asian network. Several NGOs and trade unions that work with waste pickers, as well as loosely formed groups of waste pickers, were identified in Cambodia, Indonesia, The Philippines, and Thailand. In Bangladesh, Grambangla Unnayan Committee is working with the waste picker community at Matuail Waste Dumpsite of Dhaka City Corporation. A daycare centre and a non-formal primary school has been established for the child waste pickers where 112 child waste pickers are given early childhood care and education. Women waste pickers of Matuail has formed a Waste Pickers' cooperative. In Pune (India) there are a worker cooperative of Waste Pickers, called SWaCH. SWaCH is an acronym for Solid Waste Collection Handling that also means clean, in the local language. This initiative empower all members. They all work, they're not merely shareholders. Among the workers, in most age groups, women constitute a bigger group than men, with a total of 78%. However, men are the majority in the youngest age group. Before joining SWaCH, most members used to work as waste pickers or itinerant waste buyers. There's also another group that is constituted by former housekeeping and cleaning workers. The predominant group of SWaCH belongs to the Scheduled Caste, although other Backward Castes, as well as the middle castes, are also represented in SWaCH. This initiative is a result of Inclusive cities project that has the objective of integrating Waste Pickers into Municipal Solid Waste Management in Pune (India). Organizing in Africa Egypt has of the world's most well-established and robust informal recycling systems. The labor is done for the most part by the Zabaleen (informal waste collectors), a predominantly Coptic Christian community, which in the 1940s began collecting garbage‚Äîwork viewed as impure by Egypt's Muslim majority. In 2003, the Zabaleen's existence and way of life came under threat when Cairo authorities awarded annual contracts $50 to three multinational garbage disposal companies, pushing the Zabaleen to collectively defend their livelihood. The South African Waste Picker organization held its first meeting in July 2009, which included 100 waste pickers from 26 landfills across the country. There are no present plans to create an African waste picker's network, but Shack/Slum Dwellers International organized meetings between waste picker leaders in Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa.

In the 1921 census, there were 83 inhabitants.A list of the inhabitants of Maberly as recorded on the Newfoundland census of 1921 can be found at The GenWeb Project's NLGenWeb 1921 NF Census page It has long been associated with nearby Elliston, being about 3 km from Elliston Centre by road, and was officially annexed by that town in the 1960s. Driving from Elliston Centre to Maberly, you pass through Sandy Cove and the Neck. Geography Maberly is located by sea between the towns of Little Catalina and Elliston. Among the named coves in Maberly as you enter the community are Thomas' Cove (), Chris' Cove () and Charlie's Cove (). There is a small cove between Chris' Cove and Charlie's Cove which never seems to have been named () ‚Äî at least not a name which stuck. The coves and roads of Maberly Thomas' Cove, just off the coast of which lies South (Suder) Bird Island (), is the broadest of the coves and its shore is covered with relatively large beach stones; between Thomas' Cove and Chris' Cove there are cliffs and a small gulch; Chris' Cove, into which Muddy Brook empties, has a broad, flat bedrock formation which slopes into the ocean and received a government-sponsored slipway which fell into disrepair in the 1990s and has been removed; the aforementioned 'nameless cove' is on the other side of a tiny point of land; then there is a headland between this nameless cove and Charlie's Cove called The Gaze or often just over below. A gravel road climbs a much larger headland to the other side of Charlie's Cove, passing a steep- sided gulch and then peters out into the wilderness after several hundred metres and several houses. It is this road which now forms the beginning of the Little Catalina-Maberly walking trail. The coast rises to relatively steep cliffs with no harbour possibilities for several kilometres. Another rough road leaves the community on the inland side and quickly branches, the shorter branch being the gravel pit road in whose gravel pit several demolition derbies have been held and a much longer road which brings you out into Duke's Land (named for a man by the name of Marmaduke, not a nobleman). Muddy Brook: the brook and the pond The brook which flows through the community is still called Muddy Brook, reminiscent of the community's former name, and the brook flows from Muddy Brook Pond just below which is a wide steady which looks almost like another small pond. The road to Duke's Land brings you here. () Regional Geography Flowers Cove (), named for the treacherous maritime rock shallows known as the 'Flowers' is within easy walking distance from the community along the Little Catalina-Maberly walking trail through some very productive and picturesque berry-picking grounds. Northern (Noder) Bight is an abandoned community between Maberly and Little Catalina most of whose former inhabitants moved to Maberly or to Catalina from the 1850s to the 1890s. Residents of Maberly themselves mostly resettled to more central parts of Elliston or to Bonavista during the 1950s and 1960s. Settlement and early history Maberly was originally called Muddy Brook and was first permanently settled by John Chaulk and his sons in or around 1806. Former Provincial Park Just inside the entrance to Maberly, there is a look-out for the Bird Islands which was originally constructed as Maberly Provincial Park in the same category as Dungeon Provincial Park in Bonavista i.e. a day park for picnicking and, in Maberly's case, bird-watching. Elliston town council has assumed responsibility for the park and now there is a demonstration garden there and tourist poster boards describing topics such as root cellar construction and gardening in the area. Fishing grounds Historically, the shoals in the area of Maberly were highly productive.

The preceding expression, whose meaning is determined or specified by the later expression, may be called a cataphor. Cataphora is a type of anaphora, although the terms anaphora and anaphor are sometimes used in a stricter sense, denoting only cases where the order of the expressions is the reverse of that found in cataphora. An example of cataphora in English is the following sentence: * When he arrived home, John went to sleep. In this sentence, the pronoun he (the cataphor) appears earlier than the noun John (the postcedent) that it refers to. This is the reverse of the more normal pattern, \\"strict\\" anaphora, where a referring expression such as John or the soldier appears before any pronouns that reference it. Both cataphora and anaphora are types of endophora.  Examples  Other examples of the same type of cataphora are: * If you want some, here's some parmesan cheese. * After he had received his orders, the soldier left the barracks. * If you want them, there are cookies in the kitchen. Cataphora across sentences is often used for rhetorical effect. It can build suspense and provide a description. For example: * He's the biggest slob I know. He's really stupid. He's so cruel. He's my boyfriend Nick. The examples of cataphora described so far are strict cataphora, because the anaphor is an actual pronoun. Strict within- sentence cataphora is highly restricted in the sorts of structures it can appear within, generally restricted to a preceding subordinate clause. More generally, however, any fairly general noun phrase can be considered an anaphor when it co-refers with a more specific noun phrase (i.e. both refer to the same entity), and if the more general noun phrase comes first, it can be considered an example of cataphora. Non-strict cataphora of this sort can occur in many contexts, for example: * A little girl, Jessica, was playing on the swings. ('The anaphor a little girl co-refers with Jessica.) * Finding the right gadget was a real hassle. I finally settled with a digital camera. (The anaphor the right gadget co-refers with a digital camera.) Strict cross- sentence cataphora where the antecedent is an entire sentence is fairly common cross-linguistically: * I should have known it: The task is simply too difficult. * Ich h√§tte es wissen m√ºssen: Die Aufgabe ist einfach zu schwer. (Same as previous sentence, in German.) Cataphora of this sort is particularly common in formal contexts, using an anaphoric expression such as this or the following: * This is what I believe: that all men were created equal. * After squaring both sides, we arrive at the following: x = y^3 + 2z - 1.

It is a Grade I listed building and a striking landmark in south-east Warwickshire.  History  The windmill is one of Warwickshire's most famous landmarks. It stands on a hilltop overlooking the village of Chesterton, near the Roman Fosse Way and about five miles (8 km) south-east of Warwick. It was built around 1632‚Äì1633, probably by Sir Edward Peyto, who was Lord of the Chesterton Manor House. At this time John Stone, a pupil of Inigo Jones, was in Chesterton designing the new Manor House and he probably helped with the windmill as well. Sir Edward was a mathematician and astrologer and probably his own architect for the windmill, but although claims have been made that the tower was originally built as an observatory, the estate accounts now at Warwick Record Office show that it has always been a windmill, making it the earliest tower mill in England to retain any of its working parts.  Construction  It is built of hard local limestone, with sandstone detailing, on a shallow platform of in diameter. The mill tower with a cap height of , unique worldwide in structure and mechanics, is supported on six semicircular arches, on piers, the outer faces of which are arcs of circles radiating from a common centre. A sandstone string course surmounts the six arches and runs round the tower, below the windows. There are four windows in the tower, two small and two much larger with stone mullioned windows. A three-light window set in the roof on the opposite side to the sails, has a small plaque above it with the letters \\"E. P. 1632\\".  Workings  Beside the open ground floor within the arches there are two more floors to the mill, the first, lower, or stone floor above ground level, housing millstones, great spur wheel, hurst frame, sack hoist rope passing through the floor trap, and the upper, second, or hoist floor with brake wheel, main gearing (wallover), sack hoist pulley, and parts of the winding winch. The windshaft and the main parts of the winding system including the wind direction indicator is installed within the cap. The space inside the arches, until 1930, used to have a wooden structure to store the grain, and an open timber staircase to reach the milling floors. This structure was removed to prevent vandalism. The cap of the mill is a shallow dome which used to be covered with lead sheet, but also because of vandalism is now covered with aluminium. Between the cap and the top of the wall is a system of rollers running in a track plate allowing the cap to be rotated easily. There is a wind direction indicator on the roof which is continued into the interior, and a small repeat indicator at its lower end, so that the miller could set the mill without leaving his work. The lattice-type- sails are span counter clock-wise rotation (seen from outside the mill; most of all windmills worldwide rotate clockwise seen from inside the mill - from \\"under the wind\\") and with of canvas. The arched tower covers a very small diameter of and it has an unusual \\"in cap\\" winding gear for an English windmill, the cap being winded by a hand-operated winch having spur and worm gears.  Restoration  The mill without its sails It seems the mill has undergone three major reconstructions, one in 1776 when the mill shaft was modified, and the date carved in the tail of the shaft, and one in 1860 when the old curb and cap framing was altered. By 1910 it had ceased to function as a mill because the winding gear failed to operate, so that her last miller, William Haynes, was no longer able to turn the mill's cap round to make the sails face the wind. He abandoned the mill and moved to Harbury tower mill, one mile to the east. In the 1930s the mill was sometimes used for milling at 'prosperous' winds. Minor repairs to the sails and the wind vane took place. In the early 1950s one sail broke off and was restored years after. It was not until 1969 that a larger reconstruction of Chesterton Mill began again under the control of Warwickshire County Council, now responsible for its upkeep, and the reconstruction of the machinery. The windmill repairs were finished in 1971, and the mill reopened for a few days to the public each year in summertime (volunteers from nearby villages help run the open days and provide stewards for the event). In 2006 one of the sails fell off the windmill during an open day, injuring one visitor. Initially, following the incident, the area was roped off to prevent visitors approaching the windmill. The sails themselves were then removed for strengthening. They were finally replaced in late 2007. In 1975 it was awarded one of the Civic Trust Heritage Awards.  Similar structure in Rhode Island, United States  Newport Tower, US in 2004 Newport Tower, a stone tower similar to Chesterton Windmill exists in Newport, Rhode Island, US. The commonly accepted theory is that it was built by Benedict Arnold around 1676 after a previous wooden mill was blown down in 1675. It is not quite the same as Chesterton Windmill, having eight round pillars, but it was very similar. The Arnold family, whose place of origin is disputed but may have been either Leamington or further down the Fosse Way, near Ilchester in Somerset, emigrated to Rhode Island in 1635 where Benedict became governor in 1663. This, together with the documentary evidence for the Tower's use as a mill in Arnold's will and the lack of archaeological evidence for the site having been used before the mid-17th century, has led to the generally accepted theory that the Newport Tower was based on Chesterton Windmill.

Infection of a susceptible cowpea leaf causes a \\"mosaic\\" pattern in the leaf, and results in high virus yields (1-2 g/kg). Its genome consists of 2 molecules of positive-sense RNA (RNA-1 and RNA-2) which are separately encapsidated. Both RNA1 and RNA2 have a VPg (virus genome-linked protein) at the 5'end, and polyadenylation at the 3' end. Genomic RNA1 and RNA2 are expressed by a polyprotein processing strategy. RNA1 encodes helicase, VPg, protease and RdRp. RNA2 encodes movement protein and coat protein. The virus particles are 28 nm in diameter and contain 60 copies each of a Large (L) and Small (S) coat protein. The structure is well characterised to atomic resolution, and the viral particles are thermostable. The identification of the virus is attributed to Lister and Thresh in 1955, but it is now known as a variant of the Sunn-hemp mosaic virus. CPMV displays a number of features that can be exploited for nanoscale biomaterial fabrication. Its genetic, biological and physical properties are well characterised, and it can be isolated readily from plants.

He was converted to Christianity by David Livingstone and in his role as ruler served as a missionary among his own and other African peoples. According to Livingstone biographer Stephen Tomkins, Sechele was Livingstone's only African convert to Christianity, even though Livingstone himself came to regard Sechele as a \\"backslider\\". Sechele led the a coalition of Batswana (baKw√™na, Bakaa, Balete, Batlokwa) in the Battle of Dimawe in 1852. Early life Sechele was born in 1812, the son of the chief of the Kw√™na tribe of Tswana people of what is modern-day Botswana. When Sechele was ten years old, his father was killed and the leadership of the tribe was divided between his two uncles. Sechele and some of his supporters fled into the desert. He spent some years among the Ngwato people and married Mokgokong, a daughter of Chief Kgari. In about 1831 he succeeded in replacing one of his uncles as ruler of half the baKw√™na. Conversion to Christianity Mission house in Molopolole In 1847 Sechele met David Livingstone at Tshwane. He and his people accompanied the missionary to the Kolobeng River where Livingstone set up the Kolobeng Mission. The establishment of missions was sometimes encouraged by local rulers because the missionaries gave them access to guns and gunpowder, which gave them an advantage over neighbouring tribes lacking such technology. Sechele was eager to learn to read and write and was an adept student, learning the letters of the alphabet in two days. He became so keen on learning that he rose early and breakfasted before dawn. Once he had mastered reading, he taught his wives to read. The only book available in the language of the Tswana was the Bible. He later sent five of his children to be educated by another missionary, Robert Moffat, at Kuruman. (Chapter 6) Sechele experienced several conflicts between local custom and Christianity. He had to give up his role as the local rainmaker. He fell into conflict with the Livingstone over his marriage to five women. At first Livingstone was inclined to be relaxed about it Article by Fideles Nkomazana in Gerald O. West, Musa W. Dube Shomaha (2000) THe Bible in Africa: Transactions, Trajectories, and Trends. but feeling under pressure from other missionaries, he demanded divorce of four of the five.Tomkins, Stephen (2013). David Livingstone, The Unexplored Story. Lion Hudson. Sechele did so. As there were no further impediments, he was baptised in 1848. After the divorces and Sechele's baptism, one of his ex-wives became pregnant by him. He also killed a European, apparently for judicial reasons. As a result, Livingstone denounced him as a Christian. This was despite Sechele's repentance and protestations of faith. Sechele told Livingstone, \\"I shall never give up Jesus. You and I will stand before him together\\". During the time of their association, Livingstone urged Sechele to make peace with the uncle who ruled the other half of the Kw√™na. Sechele sent his uncle a gift of gunpowder. The uncle was suspicious of the gift and set fire to it. His death in the resulting explosion enabled Sechele to reunite the tribe. Sechele seems to have been a deep, independent thinker. He was powerfully committed to Jesus Christ (rather than European Christianity), such that he made this commitment at a time when it was politically and personally inconvenient to do so and, after Livingstone left him, he continued as missionary to his own and other people. Whereas most African converts simply assumed the ideas of European Christianity, Sechele went back to the original source, the Bible, and tried to work out a more African kind of Christianity. There is still controversy over the effects of this, and traditional missionaries of the time described him as, \\"half Christian, half heathen\\". Battle of Dimawe Missionaries such as Livingstone were unpopular with the Boers, in Livingstone's case because he was believed to have supplied rifles and ammunition to the Kw√™na.Sillery, p. 27 Because Sechele and the Kw√™na lived on the route to Central Africa, between the Transvaal and Shoshong, Sechele was perceived by the Boers as a danger to their western border.Sillery, pp. 27-28 In 1852 a group of Bahurutshe people who were slaves of the Boers escaped and fled to the Kw√™na for protection. The Boers destroyed the Kolobeng mission and attacked the Kw√™na at Dimawe, where they encountered the combined Batswana tribes of Bakw√™na, Bahurutshe, Balete and Batlokwa. Before the attack there was an attempt by the Batswana to protect the women and children by sending them into hiding, but according to Livingstone, many were taken prisoner by the Boers. Under the leadership of Sechele, Khama of Bangwato, and Bathoen I of Bangwaketse, the Boers were defeated by a combination of strategy and fire power. Sechele and the London Missionary Society both complained about the Boers' actions to the Colonial Secretary in London. But because the British were at that time negotiating with the Boers over the Sand River Convention, the British High Commissioner was instructed not to go beyond \\"friendly remonstrances\\" with the Boers over the matter.Sillery, p. 29 The British did not want to risk their relationship with the Boers by appearing to side with Sechele. Moreover, British interests lay in colonising the area, rather than protecting its inhabitants. Sechele set out for England with the intention of seeking the protection of Queen Victoria, but his resources ran out by the time he reached Cape Town. Mission Christian herald and signs of our times (1886) The Late Rev. W. E. Boardman, Sechele, Chief of the Bechuanas, in State Attire. that, without employing the highest arguments at his disposal, the believer is able to defend his position against the assaults of the foe. Sechele had a profound knowledge of the Bible and a commitment to spreading Christianity. He began with his own people, teaching them to read and introducing them to the Bible. He also travelled many hundreds of miles to evangelise other African peoples. When Moffat led a group of missionaries into Matabeleland in 1859, he discovered that Sechele had preceded him and that the local Ndebele people held Christian prayers. Moffat's mission had little success as an outbreak of lung disease among the missionaries' oxen resulted in fear of the white missionaries.Bulawayo History, Zimbabwe Ndebele people and Christianity, (retrieved 5 April 2013) Officially, there were no converts among the Ndebele until the 1880s. After the departure of Livingstone, Sechele returned to some of his local customs, including rainmaking and polygamy. Missionaries complained that he used his great knowledge of the scriptures to defend his own actions. Neil Parsons, of the University of Botswana, stated that Sechele \\"did more to propagate Christianity in nineteenth-century southern Africa than virtually any single European missionary\\". Under his leadership, his region became a refuge to other people fleeing persecution, and the numbers that he ruled exceeded 30,000 at the time of his death in 1892.

The road tunnel should not be confused with the parallel Tauern Rail Tunnel which crosses the High Tauern range between Bad Gastein in Salzburg and Mallnitz in Carinthia, taking both standard rail passengers as well as car shuttle trains between the two locations. Construction Planned as a two bore tunnel from the beginning, the first bore of the Tauern Road Tunnel was completed in 1975 with a total length of . Plans for the construction of the second, parallel tube were abandoned in 1988 and not resumed until the 1999 fire disaster (see below). 1999 fire On 29 May 1999, about 4:50 a.m., an accident in the tunnel led to a fire in which twelve people were killed and 42 injured. Caused by a collision of up to 60 individual vehicles, the incident occurred when a truck collided with a column of stationary vehicles waiting at a traffic signal. As far as investigators could determine, eight people were killed by the force of the collision of the truck while four further victims died from the fire which followed, exacerbated by escaping fuel and hazardous materials on one of the vehicles involved. All of the victims were burned to the point of leaving skeletal remains at most, and for those in more intense areas of the fire, nothing more than ashes. The tunnel was so badly damaged by the heat from the fire that it had to be closed for three months for repairs during which major work was undertaken to improve the barriers, tunnel walls and ventilation system. A memorial service for the victims of the fire was held in the municipality of Flachau before the tunnel was officially reopened on 28 August 1999.

They took place at an unknown location in the Kingdom of Mercia.  Location  The location of the place-name Clovesho has never been conclusively identified. Scholars believe that Clovesho must have been located in the kingdom of Mercia, or close to it, and close enough to the sees of the southern English bishops to travel to. It has been described by Clifford Offer as \\"the most famous lost place in Anglo-Saxon England\\".By Clifford Offer, quoted by Slater & Goose below The strongest candidate for the location of Clovesho has long been Brixworth in Northamptonshire, where the surviving Anglo-Saxon church of All Saints' Church, Brixworth is indicative of the importance of the settlement during the Anglo-Saxon period.R. H. C.

A county of small towns: the development of Hertfordshire's urban landscape to 1800, p. 191, 2008, Univ of Hertfordshire Press, , The Councils' dates and their Acts are known. Those Councils of Clovesho for which authentic evidence exists are those of 742, 747, 794, 798, 803, 824 and 825.  The purpose and nature of the councils  When Archbishop Theodore of Tarsus held the Council of Hertford in 672 or 673, he declared to the assembled bishops that he had been \\"appointed by the Apostolic See to be Bishop of the Church of Canterbury\\". A canon was passed to the effect that in future yearly synods should be held on 1 August every year \\"in the place which is called Clofeshoch\\".Bede, H. E., IV, ch. v. This ruling represents the inauguration of the first parliamentary system known to have operated in the British Isles; \\"there had never before been a parliament with authority enough to decide on matters concerning all the English peoples\\". Meetings were held at Clovesho for more than 150 years. The councils at Clovesho, and those generally of the Anglo-Saxon period, were mixed assemblies which included bishops, abbots, the king of Mercia and the chief men of his kingdom. The councils had the character not only of a church synod but of the Witenagemot, an assembly of the ruling class whose primary function was to advise the king. The affairs of the Church were decided by the bishops, who were in turn presided over by the archbishop. The king presided over his chiefs and gave his authority to their decisions. There is no evidence of any royal interference in the spiritual legislation or judgments of the Church. England was not yet united into one kingdom, but the decisions made at Clovesho, as far as can be judged from participants' signatures, represented the decisions of the whole English Church south of the Humber. Seventy years after the Hertford council, the first Council of Clovesho of which we have an authentic record was held. The Canterbury Cartulary contained a charter stating that in 716 the privilege of Wihtred to the churches was \\"confirmed and ratified in a synod held in the month of July in a place called Clovesho\\". Some doubt has been expressed about the authenticity of this document.  The Council of 742  The first Council of Clovesho was presided over by √Üthelbald of Mercia and Archbishop Cuthbert of Canterbury. According to the record of its proceedings, the council \\"diligently enquired into the needs of religion, the Creed as delivered by the ancient teaching of the Fathers, and carefully examined how things were ordered at the first beginning of the Church here in England, and where the honour of the monasteries according to the rules of justice was maintained\\".Given in Kemble's Codex Diplomaticus √Üvi Saxonici, 87. The privilege of Wihtred, which assured the liberty of the Church, was solemnly confirmed. No other provisions were mentioned.  The Council of 747  The second Council of Clovesho was one of the most important such gatherings recorded in the history of the Anglo-Saxon Church. Its acts were copied by SpelmanCouncils, I, 240. from an ancient Cottonian manuscript, which is now lost.They are printed in Wilkins, I, 94; in Mansi, XII, 395; and in Haddan and Stubbs, III, 360. The acts state that the Council was composed of \\"bishops and dignitaries of less degree from the various provinces of Britain\\" and that it was presided over by Archbishop Cuthbert. According to a manuscript preserved by William of Malmesbury, \\"King Ethelbald and his princes and chiefs were present\\". The Acts related that \\"first of all, the Metropolitan, as president, brought forth in their midst two letters of the Apostolic Lord, Pope Zachary, venerated throughout the whole world, and with great care these were plainly read, and also openly translated into our own language, according as he himself by his Apostolic authority had commanded\\". The papal letters are described as containing a fervent admonition, addressed to the English people of every rank and condition, and stated that those who condemned these warnings and remained obstinate in their malice should be punished by sentence of excommunication. The council then drew up thirty-one canons, the majority of which dealt with matters of ecclesiastical discipline and liturgy. The thirteenth and fifteenth canons are noteworthy as showing the close union of the Anglo-Saxon Church with the Holy See. The thirteenth canon stated that > [A]ll the most sacred Festivals of Our Lord made Man, in all things > pertaining to the same, viz.: in the Office of Baptism, the celebration of > Masses, in the method of chanting, shall be celebrated in one and the same > way, namely, according to the sample which we have received in writing from > the Roman Church. And also, throughout the course of the whole year, the > festivals of the Saints are to be kept on one and the same day, with their > proper psalmody and chant, according to the Martyrology of the same Roman > Church. The fifteenth canon adds that in the seven hours of the daily and nightly Office the clergy \\"must not dare to sing or read anything not sanctioned by the general use, but only that which comes down by authority of Holy Scripture, and which the usage of the Roman Church allows\\". Other canons required that the litanies and rogations were to be observed by the clergy and people with great reverence \\"according to the rite of the Roman Church\\". The feasts of St. Gregory and of St. Augustine, \\"who was sent to the English people by our said Pope and father St. Gregory\\", were to be solemnly celebrated. The clergy and monks were to live so as to be always prepared to receive worthily the most holy Body and Blood of the Lord, and the laity were to be exhorted to the practice of frequent Communion. Persons who did not know Latin were to join in the psalmody by intention, and were to be taught to say prayers for the living or for the repose of the souls of the dead in English. Neither clergy nor monks were to be allowed to live in the houses of the people, nor were they to adopt or imitate the dress which is worn by the laity.  The Council of 794  The record of the third Council of Clovesho is a charter by which Offa of Mercia made a grant of land for pious purposes. The charter stated that it has been drawn up \\"in the general synodal Council in the most celebrated place called Clofeshoas\\". Around the time when the papal legates presided at the Council of Chelsea in 787, Offa had obtained from Pope Adrian I that a new archbishopric should be created at Lichfield and that the Mercian sees should be subjected to its jurisdiction and withdrawn from that of Canterbury. Consequently, at this Council of 794, Higbert of Lichfield, to whom the pope had sent the pallium, signed as an archbishop.  The Council of 798  A council was held at Clovesho in 798 by Archbishop Ethelheard with Coenwulf of Mercia, at which the bishops and abbots and chief men of the province were present. Its proceedings are related in a document by Archbishop Ethelheard,Lambeth Manuscript 1212, p. 312; Haddan and Stubbs, III, 512. who stated that his first care was to examine diligently \\"in what way the Catholic Faith was held and how the Christian religion was practised amongst them\\". To this inquiry, \\"they all replied with one voice: 'Be it known to your Paternity, that even as it was formerly delivered to us by the Holy Roman and Apostolic See, by the mission of the most Blessed Pope Gregory, so do we believe, and what we believe, we in all sincerity do our best to put into practice.'\\" The Council also devoted time in dealing with questions of church property, and producing an agreement of exchange of lands between the archbishop and the Abbess Cynethryth.  The Council of 803  The fifth Council of Clovesho was one of the most remarkable of the series, as its Acts contained the declaration of the restitution of the Mercian sees to the province of Canterbury by the authority of Pope Leo III. In 798, Coenwulf of Mercia addressed to the pope a long letter, representing \\"with great affection and humility\\" the disadvantages of the new archbishopric at Lichfield that had been created eleven years before by Pope Adrian I. In the letter the king submitted the whole case to the pope, asking his blessing and saying: \\"I love you as one who is my father, and I embrace you with the whole strength of my obedience\\", and promising to abide in all things by his decision. \\"I judge it fitting to bend humbly the ear of our obedience to your holy commands, and to fulfil with all our strength whatever may seem to your Holiness that we ought to do.\\"Haddan and Stubbs, III, 521. √Üthelhard, Archbishop of Canterbury, travelled to Rome to plead for the restitution of the sees. In 802, Leo granted the petition of the king and the archbishop and issued to the latter a Papal bull in which he restored to him the full jurisdiction enjoyed by his predecessors. The pope communicated this judgment in a letter to Coenwulf.Haddan and Stubbs, III, 538. This decision was duly proclaimed in the Council of Clovesho held in the following year. Archbishop Ethelheard declared to the synod that \\"by the co-operation of God and of the Apostolic Lord, the Pope Leo\\", he and his fellow-bishops unanimously ratified the rights of the See of Canterbury, and that an archbishopric should never more be founded at Lichfield, and that the grant of the pallium made \\"with the consent and permission of the Apostolic Lord Pope Adrian, be considered as null, having been obtained surreptitiously and by evil suggestion\\". After Higbert, the Archbishop of Lichfield, submitted to the papal judgment and retired to a monastery, the Mercian sees returned to the jurisdiction of Canterbury.  Further synods  In 824 and 825 two further synods were held at Clovesho, \\"Beornwulf, King of Mercia, presiding and the Venerable Archbishop Wulfred ruling and controlling the Synod\\", according to the record of the first, and \\"Wulfred the Archbishop presiding, and also Beornwulf, King of Mercia\\", according to the second. The first assembly was occupied in deciding a suit concerning an inheritance and the second in terminating a dispute between the archbishop and the Abbess Cynethryth.Haddan and Stubbs, III, 593, 596.

The brigade was first raised in 1912 in New South Wales following the introduction of the compulsory training scheme. During World War I, the brigade was formed as part of the First Australian Imperial Force in 1916, with the majority of its recruits coming from New South Wales. It was assigned to the 3rd Division, and training was carried out in the United Kingdom before the brigade was committed to the fighting on the Western Front in November 1916. It fought in numerous battles in France and Belgium for the next two years. After the war, the brigade was disbanded, but was re-raised as a part-time formation in the Sydney area. During World War II, the brigade was mobilised for defensive duties, but did not see active service before it was disbanded in June 1944. In the post war period, the 9th Brigade was re-raised once again as a part-time formation, and forms part of the 2nd Division. History The 9th Brigade traces its origins to 1912, when it was formed as a Militia brigade as part of the introduction of the compulsory training scheme, assigned to the 2nd Military District. The brigade's constituent units were spread across various locations in New South Wales including Camperdown, Darlington, Enmore, Newtown, Marrickville, St Peters and Petersham. During World War I, the 9th Brigade was originally formed as part of the First Australian Imperial Force. Raised from volunteers drawn from New South Wales, the 9th Brigade was formed in 1916 in the period as the AIF was expanded following the failed Gallipoli Campaign. The brigade consisted of four infantry battalions‚Äîthe 33rd, 34th, 35th and 36th Battalions‚Äîas well as the 9th Light Trench Mortar Battery and the 9th Machine Gun Company (which later formed part of the 3rd Machine Gun Battalion). Its first commander was Brigadier General Alexander Jobson. The brigade was attached to the 3rd Division and after rudimentary training in Australia, the brigade was shipped to England to complete its training before being committed to the fighting on the Western Front in France and Belgium in November 1916. The brigade's first major battle came in mid-1917 when it took part in the Battle of Messines. Later in the year, it fought during the Battle of Passchendaele before taking part in defensive operations during the German Spring Offensive in early 1918. In April it was involved in the Allied counterattack at the First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. This was followed by the Second Battle of Morlancourt,Coulthard-Clark (1998), p. 146. before the brigade took part in the final offensive of the war, the Hundred Days Offensive. During this time, the 9th Brigade's casualties had been so high, that one of its battalions‚Äîthe 36th‚Äîhad to be disbanded in order to reinforce the others. After Jobson, the brigade's other wartime commanders were Charles Rosenthal and Henry Goddard. The 35th Battalion's position near Lena Wood, 8 August 1918 Following the end of hostilities the brigade was disbanded in 1919, however, while the AIF had been deployed, a separate Citizens Force (later known as the Militia) formation remained in Australia. By 1918, a 9th Brigade had been established within the 2nd Military District, consisting of the 33rd, 34th, 35th and 36th Infantry Battalions.Australian Military Forces (1918), pp. 8‚Äì31. The AIF was formally disbanded in 1921, at which time it was decided to reorganise the Citizens Force to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF.Grey (2008), p. 125. Headquartered in Paddington, in Sydney, the brigade was subsequently reorganised after which it consisted of four infantry battalions‚Äîthe 1st, 19th, 34th and 45th Battalions.Palazzo (2001), pp. 91 & 102. It remained part of the 2nd Military District and by 1928 it formed part of the 2nd Infantry Division.Kuring (2004), p. 107. At the outset of World War II, the brigade was tasked with the defence of Sydney, and consisted of the 1st, 4th, 17th and 45th Battalions. In April 1941, the brigade was transferred to the 1st Division and later reduced to three infantry battalions: the 1st, 17th and 18th. Following Japan's entry into the war, the brigade was called up for full time service and mobilised at Narellan before moving to Thornleigh, where it covered an area between Manly to Dee Why and Mona Vale. During this time, the brigade's focus was upon construction of defences before elements of the 8th Brigade relieved them in March 1942, allowing the brigade to commencing training at Wallgrove to adopt a more mobile defensive posture.McKenzie-Smith (2018), p. 2070. In late 1942, the brigade was warned out to deploy to Darwin, Northern Territory, but was instead moved to the Illawarra region. Throughout 1943, the numbers of troops retained in New South Wales was reduced as the garrison was moved north, and elements of the Militia were disbanded to return personnel to war essential war industries. Finally, in June 1944, the 9th Brigade, consisting of the 1st/45th, 17th and 20th/34th Battalions, was disbanded at Narellan.McKenzie- Smith (2018), p. 2071. Following the end of the war, the Citizens Military Force was not re-established until 1948, when it was re-raised on a reduced establishment.Grey (2008), p. 200. Post war the brigade was part of the 3rd Division, and consisted of the 10th and 27th Battalions.Palazzo (2002), p. 163. By 1953, the 9th Brigade had been formed within Central Command.Palazzo (2001), p. 238. Since then the brigade has been a Reserve formation, although at times its designation has been changed; from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s it adopted the title of the 9th Task Force. The current 9th Brigade was raised on 1 February 1988 in Land Command. Around this time, the brigade was tasked with vital asset protection in northern Australia, in the event of war.Kuring (2004), p. 392. On 1 September 1994, the brigade moved from under command of Land Headquarters to form part of the 2nd Division, based in South Australia. By 2000, the brigade's area of responsibility included both the Northern Territory and South Australia.Kuring (2004), p. 436. In November 2008, 9th Brigade mounted Rotation 17 to the Solomon Islands under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Russ Lowes, in support of Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). Rotation 17 completed their deployment and returned to Adelaide on 5 April 2009. Personnel from the 9th Brigade have also recently taken part in operational deployments to Afghanistan and Timor, and border security operations in the waters to Australia's north. Under Plan Beersheba, the brigade is tasked with generating a battlegroup in support of the 1st Brigade, one year in every three.

The population in 1983 was over 100,000. It belongs to Efon Local Government, one of the largest local governments in Ekiti State. Demographics Efon Alaaye people are predominantly farmers, they grow cash crops like kolanuts, cocoa, palm tree, they are also known to be a major producers of yam, rice, cassava, maize and many fruits. The people of Efon Alaaye are subject to their king the Alaaye of Efon assisted by the six high chiefs of six major districts called \\"the iwara mefa\\" Efon Alaaye people are Christian and widely accepted Jesus Christ by the 1930 major revival that caused a revolution that left the town with several cathedrals. The major denominational groups are Catholics, Anglicans, Christ Apostolic Church, and very recently the Pentecostals are gaining grounds, including the Seventh-day Adventist Church which has been established to make its presence felt among these very religious people. History Efon Alaaye dates back to 1200 A.D. In accordance with the historical facts, the founder and the first Alaaye (the title of Efon Alaaye Kings) of Efon Alaaye was Obalufon Alaayemore who was the third king or Ooni (title of Ile Ife kings) of Ile Ife, the cradle of Yoruba race. His father was the founder and father of the Yorubas and is known as Oduduwa or Odua. Obalufon Alaayemore installed his son Adudu Oranku to reign after him when he departed Efon Alaaye to go and ascend the throne in Ile Ife. The founder of Efon Alaaye was about the only known king who reigned over two kingdoms with one of the kingdoms twice in his lifetime. He first ruled as the third Ooni of Ile- Ife having succeeded his father Obalufon Ogbogbodirin but vacated the throne on the advice of the Ile- Ife king makers for his uncle the Ife War Hero, ORANMIYAN who became the fourth Ooni of Ife. Obalufon Alayemore thereafter went and founded the kingdom of Efon Alaaye after vacating the Ile- Ife throne. He was called back to Ile- Ife by the king makers to become the fifth Ooni after the death of ORANMIYAN.

Ichiki commanded the 28th Infantry Regiment \\"Ichiki detachment\\" in Battle of the Tenaru. The regiment was disastrously defeated by the 1st Marine Regiment and of the 917 soldiers of Ichiki's 1st echelon, only 128 survived. Ichiki was either killed during the final stages of the battle, or performed ritual suicide (seppuku) shortly thereafter. Biography=Early life Born in Shizuoka Prefecture, Ichiki graduated from the 28th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1916. He subsequently served two tours as an instructor at the Imperial Army's Infantry School in Chiba.Smith, Bloody Ridge, p. 32. War in China Promoted to major in 1934, Ichiki was assigned to the China Garrison Army as a battalion commander of the 1st Infantry Regiment in 1936. On 7 July 1937, the Japanese conducted a practice night attack around the bridge, firing blanks in the air. The Chinese, thinking an attack was underway, fired a few ineffectual artillery shells. A Japanese soldier failed to show up for roll call the next morning, and Ichiki, his company commander, thought that the Chinese had captured him. He ordered an immediate attack on Wanping, precipitating the first real battle of the Second Sino-Japanese War.Spence, Jonathan D. The Search for Modern China. New York: Norton & Company, 1990, 443-469.Harries, Soldiers of the Sun, p. 202. Recalled to Japan soon after the incident, Ichiki served as an instructor in specialized military equipment training schools from 1938 until 1940. Pacific War With the start of the Pacific War in 1941, Ichiki was promoted to colonel and was placed in command of the IJA 28th Infantry Regiment, from the 7th Division, which consisted of 3,000 troops, and was assigned to assault and occupy Midway island. The defeat of Japanese naval forces at the Battle of Midway in June 1942 forced a cancellation of the operation. In August 1942, Ichiki and his regiment were transferred to the IJA 17th Army in the southern front and were based at Truk in the Caroline Islands. After Allied forces landed on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, as part of the Allied Guadalcanal campaign, Ichiki was assigned to take a portion of his regiment (2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, with artillery and engineers; nicknamed the ‚ÄúIchiki Detachment‚Äù) to recapture Henderson Airfield and drive the Allied forces off the island. On 19 August, six Japanese destroyers carried Ichiki and his 916 troops from Truk and landed them at Taivu Point on Guadalcanal. Ichiki had been ordered to wait on the beachhead for the remainder of his regiment, but finding the beach deserted and the island apparently lightly defended, Ichiki grossly underestimated the strength of the American forces, left a rear guard of 125 men, and advanced to make a nighttime frontal assault against the American positions.Toland, The Rising Sun Unknown to Ichiki, the American Marines were aware of his landing and were entrenched in defensive positions. In the Battle of the Tenaru of 21 August 1942 Ichiki was defeated with extremely heavy losses.Chen, World War II Database Recent Japanese scholarship disputes the claim that Ichiki was personally reckless/at fault, and say that the Imperial general staff put Ichiki in a suicidal position by ordering him to attack into prepared positions, outnumbered 15 to 1, with no air support, no naval support, no heavy guns, and poor intelligence that vastly underestimated American strength. The additional troops from his second group would not have changed this equation. However, the general staff needed someone to take the blame, and figured it was easy to blame Ichiki. There was also speculation that the General Staff preferred to send Ichiki to battle directly from the aborted Midway operation, figuring if the entire detachment went back to Japan the secret of the failure at Midway would leak.Sekiguchi Accounts differ as to how Ichiki died. At least one account claims that Ichiki was killed in action during the heat of battle; others state that he committed ritual suicide due to the humiliation of his defeat in the battle. Despite the failure of his attack, Ichiki was promoted posthumously to major general.

The three rocks visible are La Vou√™ta√Æthe, La Gr√¥sse, et L'√äta√Æthe Location map of Les Pierres de Lecq Les Pierres de Lecq (J√®rriais: Les Pi√®rres d√© L√©) or the Paternosters are a group of uninhabitable rocks or a reef in the Bailiwick of Jersey between Jersey and Sark, 6 km north of Gr√®ve de Lecq in Saint Mary, and 22.4 km west of the Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy. Only three or four of the rocks remain visible at high tide: L'√äta√Æthe (the eastern one), La Gr√¥sse (the big one) and La Vou√™ta√Æthe (the western one). The area has one of the greatest tidal ranges in the world, sometimes being as much as 12 metres. The name Paternosters is connected with a legend relating to the colonisation of Sark in the 16th century. According to this legend a boatload of women and children was wrecked on the reef and their cries can still be heard from time to time in the wind. Superstitious sailors would say the Lord's Prayer when passing the rocks, hence the name Paternosters. The rocks are considered to form a biogeographical boundary between a cold and a warmer part of the ocean. Together with the diverse geology of the area and the differences in wave exposure of the different parts, this creates a diverse range of habitats and considerable biodiversity. The variety of algal assemblages support a range of invertebrate species and provides a nursery area for many fish species. Among the fish for which this area is important are the European sea sturgeon, the short-snouted seahorse and the Atlantic salmon. The rocks have been listed as a Ramsar site and support a variety of small cetaceans including dolphins.

Plot Heidel von Hymack, known to all as \\"H\\", is a man with the power to cure people of incurable diseases. He travels from world to world healing people by touching them. However his healing powers have a dark side: after a while they reverse and he becomes a spreader of deadly diseases. Avoiding contact with others is almost impossible because of his celebrity, so his most dedicated followers tend to die horribly. He does not know why he has this power, though he dreams of a mysterious \\"Lady\\" who rules his life. In fact he has been accidentally joined to a deity of the Pei'an religion, a goddess of disease and healing whose changing moods determine whether he saves or kills. The only other human so joined is Francis Sandow, a man of incalculable wealth who builds planets. Sandow was introduced in the novel Isle of the Dead. To escape his fate, \\"H\\" must go with Sandow and others to the devastated remains of the Earth, destroyed in a recent war, where Sandow engages in a duel of powers to drive out the goddess. Elsewhere, Malacar Miles is the last holdout on Earth, the last bastion of the old regime and an obstacle to Sandow and other world builders who want to make the planet habitable again. Part of Sandow's mission is to remove the obstacle Malacar presents. Reception Sidney Coleman, writing in F&SF;, found the novel greatly inferior to Zelazny's previous novels, although he acknowledged that if evaluated simply as \\"preposterous adventure,\\" it was a well-written \\"superior specimen\\" marked by \\"fast action,\\" \\"strong emotion\\", \\"colorful characters,\\" and its author's \\"fertile imagination.\\"\\"Books\\", F&SF;, August 1974, pp.51-55 ReferencesSources * 1973 American novels Novels by Roger Zelazny 1973 science fiction novels American science fiction novels Doubleday (publisher) books ","title":"To Die in Italbar"},{"id":"6328630","text":"The Second Sacred War was the Spartan defeat of Phocians at Delphi and the restoration of Delphian self-control. In 458 or 457BC, Phocians captured three towns in the Spartan metropolis of Doris. A Spartan army marched on Doris, defeated the Phocians, and restored Dorian rule. On their way back to Peloponnese, Athenians attacked the Spartan army; they were repelled, and Sparta's army returned home. After the Five Years Truce, Sparta embarked on a campaign of truncating \\"Athens' imperialistic ambitions in Central Greece\\". The Second Sacred War () was a conflict over the occupation of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi: Spartans quickly removed the Athenian-backed Phocians and returned stewardship to the Delphians. After the Spartans left, however, an Athenian army‚Äîled by Pericles‚Äîtook the city and re-installed Phocian rule. Accepting the writings of Philochorus, a group of historians led by Karl Julius Beloch, Benjamin Dean Meritt, Theodore Wade-Gery, and Malcolm Francis McGregor argued that the Spartan ejection of the Phocians occurred in 449BC, and that the Athenians re-installed them in 447BC. They were opposed by historians led by Arnold Wycombe Gomme and Felix Jacoby who, rejecting Philochorus' chronology, assert that both marches on Delphi happened in 448BC. This Sacred War and the Third were the only two to be referred to as such in classical antiquity. , there was no extant evidence that these changes in Delphian governance had any effect on pilgrims to Pythia.

He was a supporter of the theory that history never follows a simple, logical course. Glotz studied at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, and in 1885 received the agr√©gation d'histoire, a competitive examination in France designed to recruit teachers for secondary school positions. In 1904, he succeeded Paul Guiraud as professor of Greek history at the Sorbonne. In 1920, he became a member of the Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres, and was named its president in 1928. His work on the economic history of Greece and the ancient Greek city is particularly noted. Le travail dans la Gr√®ce ancienne (1920) is well known in the English translation Ancient Greece at Work (1926), as is his Cit√© Grecque (1928) as The Greek City and Its Institutions (1930). According to Glotz, the first humans to arrive in Greece were semi-nomadic shepherds from the Balkans. Their society was based on a patriarchal clan, whose members were all descendant from the same ancestor and all worshiped the same deity. Unions between several clans resulted in \\"fraternit√©s\\", or armed groups. When faced with important undertakings, these groups would come together into a small number of tribes which were entirely independent in terms of religious, political, and militaristic views but which all recognized a supreme king, their chief. Glotz also distinguished between two phases of the ancient Greek city: an archaic era (1500-1400 BCE), corresponding to the Minoan age, with the formation in Greece of the first urban centers, and a Doric age, roughly viewed as a Hellenic middle age, characterized by chaos and invasions. Only fortified cities and acropolises, capable of controlling the surrounding regions, survived this period. Glotz gives his name to the Centre Gustave Glotz, a group of researchers under the auspices of the Institut national d‚Äôhistoire de l‚Äôart, the CNRS, and the Universit√© Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne.

During the Cold War era (1945‚Äì1991), the West Berlin air corridors, also known as the Berlin corridors and control zone, were three regulated airways for civil and military air traffic of the Western Allies between West Berlin and West Germany passing over East Germany's territory. The corridors and control zone were physically centered on and under control of the all-Allied Berlin Air Safety Center (BASC) in West Berlin. The airspace within these corridors was used by US, UK and French-registered non-combat aircraft belonging to these countries' armed forces and airlines operated by pilots holding those countries' passports. In addition, it was also used by LOT Polish Airlines for regular scheduled services from Warsaw to London and Paris via Sch√∂nefeld Airport to the south of East Berlin.Lufthansa through Berlin?, Air Transport ..., Flight International, 20 February 1969, p. 276 History The air corridors connected the three West Berlin airports of Tempelhof, Tegel and Gatow with other airfields/airports. Each air corridor was only wide, while the circular-shaped control zone had a radius, making it in diameter; thus allowing aircraft room to maneuver for weather and takeoff and landing. Aircraft were compelled to fly at a maximum height of .BEA in Berlin, Air Transport, Flight International, 10 August 1972, p. 181the cruising altitude of propliners employed on the Berlin Airlift However, on occasion, the height restriction would be raised to in order to accommodate Soviet military exercises.

This compelled jet aircraft crews to reduce their speed if the preceding aircraft was a slower-flying piston or turboprop plane. This in turn extended the jet's flying time inside the air corridor and resulted in higher operating costs due to increased fuel consumption at , especially on short-haul internal German services covering a maximum distance of .Aeroplane ‚Äî The Battle of Berlin, Vol. 111, No. 2842, pp. 16/7, Temple Press, London, 7 April 1966 For commercial and operational reasons, the airlines had their flights routed through the centre corridor whenever possible as this was the shortest of the three air corridors, thereby minimising the time aircraft spent cruising at . At such a low altitude, modern jet aircraft could not attain an efficient cruising speed. This extended flight times and increased fuel consumption. Therefore, use of the centre air corridor was the most economical option. Accidents and incidents * On 5 April 1948 a British European Airways Vickers 610 Viking 1B (registration: G-AIVP) operating that day's scheduled flight from Northolt via Hamburg to Berlin collided during its approach to RAF Gatow head-on with a Soviet Air Force Yakovlev Yak-3 fighter, which was performing aerobatics in the area at that time. As a result of the collision, the Viking spiralled out of control and crashed from the airport on East German territory with the loss of all 14 lives (four crew, ten passengers) on board the aircraft. The Soviet fighter pilot was killed in the accident as well. The subsequent investigation established the Soviet fighter pilot's action, which contravened all accepted rules of flying and the quadripartite flying rules to which Soviet authorities were parties, as the cause of the accident.ASN Aircraft accident description Vickers 610 Viking 1B G-AIVP ‚Äî RAF Gatow, Berlin, Germany * On 29 April 1952 an Air France Douglas C-54A (registration F-BELI) operating an internal German scheduled service from Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport to Berlin Tempelhof Airport came under sustained attack from two Soviet MiG 15 fighters while passing through one of the Allied air corridors over East Germany. Although the attack had severely damaged the plane, necessitating the shutdown of engines number three and four, the pilot in command of the aircraft managed to carry out a safe emergency landing at Tempelhof Airport. A subsequent inspection of the aircraft's damage at Tempelhof revealed that it had been hit by 89 shots fired from the Soviet MiGs during the preceding air attack. There were no fatalities among the 17 occupants (six crew, eleven passengers) despite the severity of the attack. The Soviet military authorities defended this attack on an unarmed civilian aircraft by claiming the Air France plane was outside the air corridor at the time of attack.ASN Aircraft accident description Douglas C-54A-DO F-BELI ‚Äì near Berlin, Germany * On 15 November 1966, Clipper M√ºnchen, a Pan Am Boeing 727-21 (registration N317PA) operating the return leg of the airline's daily cargo flight from Berlin to Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport (flight number PA 708) was due to land that night at Tegel Airport, rather than Tempelhof, due to runway resurfacing work taking place at that time at the latter. Berlin Control had cleared flight 708 for an instrument landing system approach to Tegel Airport's runway 08, soon after the crew had begun its descent from FL030 before entering the southwest air corridor over East Germany on the last stretch of its journey to Berlin. The aircraft impacted the ground near Dallgow, East Germany, almost immediately after the crew had acknowledged further instructions received from Berlin Control, just from Tegel Airport. All three crew members lost their lives in this accident. Visibility was poor, and it was snowing at the time of the accident. Following the accident, the Soviet military authorities in East Germany returned only half of the aircraft's wreckage to their US counterparts in West Berlin. This excluded vital parts, such as the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder as well as the plane's flight control systems, its navigation and communication equipment. The subsequent National Transportation Safety Board investigation report concluded that the aircraft's descent below its altitude clearance limit was the accident's probable cause. However, the NTSB was unable to establish the factors that had caused the crew to descend below its cleared minimum altitude.ASN Aircraft accident description Boeing 727‚Äì21 N317PA ‚Äì near Dallgow, GermanyAeroplane, Safety ‚Äî Berlin crash mystery, Vol. 116, No. 2968, p. 11, Temple Press, London, 4 September 1968727 crash cause uncertain, Air Transport ..., Flight International, 18 July 1968, p. 92 Notes and citations ;Notes ;Citations Further reading * Bonjour Deutschland ‚Äì Luftverkehr unter Nachbarn: 1926‚Äì2006 * British Garrison Berlin 1945 -1994, \\"No where to go\\", W.

Attractions Kenmore Village Shopping Centre is a central shopping centre located near the Moggill Road and Brookfield Road intersection. The shopping centre also has offices. Kenmore Plaza is another large shopping centre in the area. There are restaurants in Kenmore, including caf√©s, take-aways and pubs. The Indooroopilly Shopping Centre, a large mall with over 250 retail outlets, is about two km from Kenmore. The Brisbane City Council operates a public library at the Kenmore Village Shopping Centre on the corner Moggill Road and Brookfield Road. Kenmore has a number of churches, including Our Lady of the Rosary, Kenmore Community Church (currently located in Bellbowrie), Kenmore Anglican Church, Fuel Christian Church, Kenmore Presbyterian Church and Kenmore Uniting Church. Sports Kenmore has numerous parks and playing fields. It has easy access to outdoors activities in surrounding suburbs, including walking tracks and roads to Mt Coot-tha lookout, Brisbane Botanic Gardens and the planetarium; boating ramps into the Brisbane River and horse riding facilities in Fig Tree Pocket and Brookfield. It has a variety of sporting venues that are available for use. The largest and easiest to access is Akuna Oval, which has areas for soccer, AFL and rugby, as well as extensive walking tracks throughout the area. Other venues that can be rented are the Kenmore Primary School tennis courts and some facilities at Kenmore South Primary School. Community classes are often held at various areas around Kenmore during term-time and these classes range from yoga to fencing to pilates. There is also a women-only gym, Curves International, on Brookfield Road and a Jett's Gym, on Marshall Lane. Active sporting groups include Kenmore Australian Football Club, Gem Road Park Soccer Association, Kenmore Lions Football Club and Kenmore Centenary Bears Rugby Union. In October 2012, the Kenmore Football Club merged with the University of Queensland Football Club. Community groups Kenmore is dissected by Moggill Creek. The Moggill Creek Catchment Group organises working bees to rid the creek area of rubbish and introduced plant species, which are not suited to the area. The Rotary Club of Kenmore is non-political, non-denominational and open to all cultures, races and creeds. The Kenmore branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the Kenmore Library at the Kenmore Village shopping centre at 9 Brookfield Road. Transport Kenmore is well connected to the city and the University of Queensland by road and bus. The main road through Kenmore is Moggill Road. The retail centre of Kenmore is clustered around the roundabout where Brookfield and Moggill Roads intersect. Another transport hub is at the Kenmore Tavern complex, on the corner of Marshall Lane and Moggill Road. A motorway extension known as the Kenmore Bypass has been proposed, to alleviate congestion along Moggill Road during peak commuting hours, but has met widespread opposition from local residents because of the inevitable resumption of residential properties, loss of amenity and disruption associated with building a major new road through an established residential area.Moggill Pocket Arterial Road/Moggill-Warrego Highway Connection - Queensland Department of Main Roads There is no rail station in Kenmore. Indooroopilly is the closest station. In the 1890s the Queensland Parliament approved the construction of a rail line from Indooroopilly to Brookfield, running through the southern side of Kenmore following the valley of Cubberla Creek and thence roughly parallel to the present alignment of Kersley Road. However the line was never constructed.

He was born in Copenhagen, and became interested in statistics when, as a student of actuarial mathematics, he worked part-time at the Department of Biostatistics of the Danish State Serum Institute. He graduated from the University of Aarhus (Denmark) in 1960, where he has spent most of his academic life, and where he became professor of statistics in 1973. However, in 1962-1963 and 1963-1964 he stayed at the University of Minnesota and Stanford University, respectively, and from August 1974 to February 1975 he was an Overseas Fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge, and visitor at Statistical Laboratory, Cambridge University. Today Barndorff-Nielsen is Professor Emeritus at Aarhus University at the Thiele Centre for Applied Mathematics in Natural Science and affiliated with the Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (CREATES) on a part-time basishttp://creates.au.dk/people/research- fellows/ole-barndorff-nielsen/ and since 2008 also affiliated to Institute of Advanced Studies, Technical University Munich.  Works of Barndorff-Nielsen  Among Barndorff-Nielsen's early scientific contributions are his work on exponential families and on the foundations of statistics, in particular sufficiency and conditional inference. In 1977 he introduced the hyperbolic distribution as a mathematical model of the size distribution of sand grains, formalising heuristic ideas proposed by Ralph Alger Bagnold. He also derived the larger class of generalised hyperbolic distributions. These distributions, in particular the normal-inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution, have later turned out to be useful in many other areas of science, in particular turbulence and finance. The NIG-distribution is now widely used to describe the distribution of returns from financial assets. In 1984 he produced a short filmBarndorff-Nielsen, Ole. 1984. Blown Sand. (film). (MPEG, 196MB) Accessed 28 March 2009. on the physics of blown sand and the life of the British scientist and explorer Brigadier Ralph Alger Bagnold. A follow up to the film was produced in 2011 on the studies of stochastics in the physical sciences carried out by Barndorff-Nielsen and colleagues at the Faculty of Science, Aarhus University by the initiative of the President of the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability, Professor Victor P√©rez-Abreu. Later Barndorff-Nielsen played a leading role in the application of differential geometry to investigate statistical models. Another main contribution is his work on asymptotic methods in statistics, not least his formula for the conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator given an ancillary statistic that generalizes a formula by Ronald A. Fisher (originally called the p^*-formula, but now known as the Barndorff-Nielsen formula). He has jointly with David Cox written two influential books on asymptotic techniques in statistics. Since the mid-90s Barndorff-Nielsen has worked on stochastic models in finance (often with Neil Shephard) and turbulence, on statistical methods for the analysis of data from experiments in quantum physics, and has contributed to the theory of L√©vy processes.  Notable honors and positions held  Barndorff-Nielsen is a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters and of Academia Europaea. He has received honorary doctorate degrees from the Universit√© Paul Sabatier, Toulouse and the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. In 1993-1995 he was a very influential president of the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability. He was the editor of International Statistical Review in 1980-1987 and of the journal Bernoulli in 1994‚Äì2000. From 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2003 he was Scientific Director of MaPhySto (the Centre for Mathematical Physics and Stochastics), which was a centre devoted to advanced research and training in the fields of mathematical physics and stochastics, as well as some closely related areas. In 2001 he received the Humboldt Prize and in 2010 the Faculty Price from Faculty of Science, Aarhus University.

The project begun in 1903 and opened for travel on January 29, 1905. Originally called Benguet Road, it was later renamed in honor of its builder, Col. Lyman Walter Vere Kennon of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is the second oldest road that leads to Baguio, after Naguilian Road (now known as Quirino Highway), and the shortest route to Baguio for travelers from Manila and provinces in central and southern Luzon.Bankoff, Greg. (2005). These brothers of ours: Poblete's obreros and the road to Baguio 1903‚Äì1905. Journal of Social History - Volume 38, Number 4, Summer 2005, pp. 1047-1072 PDF at University of Auckland The entire road forms part of National Route 54 (N54) of the Philippine highway network. Route description Coming from the lowlands, Kennon Road is one of the four major access roads that lead to the highland city of Baguio. The upward climb reveals a picturesque view of the mountains, lush vegetation, and pine trees as one gets closer to the city. Most of the highway's stretch encompasses the municipality of Tuba in the province of Benguet. The small settlements along the road, known as Camps 1 to 8, were originally established for the pioneer builders of the road, but have been occupied since by local residents. The Bued River flows along a rocky canyon from the lofty heights, and following this course the road was cut above the river bed. The highway is a toll road, with the lower tollgate located about from the junction at Rosario near Camp 1. The upper tollgate is about south of Baguio near the Lion's Head and Camp 6, in Tuba. Bridal Veil Falls in the Bued River Canyon viewed from Kennon RoadThe steepest portion of the road between Camp 6 and Camp 7 in Baguio is commonly known as \\"Zigzag Road\\" because of the numerous switchbacks required. The design of the road switchbacks along that section of the road are similar in construction to the agricultural rice terraces found locally in Benguet and the other mountain provinces of the Cordillera Administrative Region. History Benguet Road construction crew near Camp 5, Tuba, Benguet ca1903 setting explosives into a sheer cliff of the Bued River Canyon. Kennon Road near Camp 7, Baguio in 1914 The construction of the road commenced in 1903 by cutting across the mountains of Benguet with the combined efforts of Filipinos, Americans, Filipino-Chinese and Japanese nationals. It was considered one of the most difficult and expensive civil engineering projects of its day, with expenditures by the newly established Insular Government of the Philippine Islands in excess of US$2.7 million. More than 2,300 foreign and local workers worked on the road. Aside from Filipino engineers and construction workers and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers headed by Col. Lyman Kennon, foreigners from 36 countries were recruited to work on the road; the majority, at about 1,500 or 22%, were Japanese. Hundreds of workers died from malaria while more plunged to their deaths while building the road. After the road was completed, some of the foreign road workers decided to remain in Baguio to live permanently. The original road was a Macadam Telford- type road which was later improved into an all-weather asphalt roadway. More recently, some portions of Kennon Road have been replaced with concrete pavement.CityofPines.com - Kennon Road The highway was severely damaged by the 1990 Luzon earthquake that the Department of Public Works and Highways decided for the permanent closure of the road. The highway was proposed to be replaced by a road traversing through the town of Itogon on the way to the lowlands of San Manuel, but was met with criticism from the inhabitants of Baguio. Kennon Road was reopened for public use in September 1, 1991 after rehabilitation efforts were completed. On August 2018, the road was closed temporarily to traffic due to road repairs. However, on December 17, 2018, the alternative route to Baguio, which is Asin‚ÄìNangalisan‚ÄìSan Pascual Road, had opened to all motorists. The road reopened on November 29, 2019 to all motorists. Road hazards Rehabilitation works on the retaining wall of the Uabac section of the road was done in 2016 after it was damaged by continuous rains the year before. Kennon Road is one of the most hazardous roads in the Philippines, especially during rainy seasons, when road accidents are common. The road is closed during heavy rains or typhoon conditions to avoid casualties from landslides Portions of the highway are also prone to land-sinking, particularly along Barangay Camp 3 in Tuba. Although Kennon is the shortest of the four major access roads, travel time is frequently as long as the other two because of poor road conditions. It usually takes an experienced commuter from 45 minutes to an hour to negotiate the steep and winding climb by car. Seasoned locals, race car drivers and motorsports enthusiasts, due to better road conditions, are now completing the drive under 30 to 25 minutes. IntersectionsFuture When opened on July 15, 2020, the 88.5-kilometer- long Tarlac‚ÄìPangasinan‚ÄìLa Union Expressway will connect Kennon Road to the Subic‚ÄìClark‚ÄìTarlac Expressway via the MacArthur Highway and North Luzon Expressway, which will cut travel time to the mountain city from Metro Manila by three to four hours.

This family contains the smallest of all beetles, with a length when fully grown of . The weight is approximately 0.4 milligrams. They are colloquially called featherwing beetles, because the hindwings are narrow and feathery. The eggs are very large in comparison to the adult female (maybe half the length) so only one egg at a time can be developed and laid. Parthenogenesis is exhibited by several species. The small size has forced many species to sacrifice some of their anatomy, like the heart, crop and gizzard. While the exoskeleton and respiration system of the insects seems to be the major limiting factors regarding how large they can get, the limit for how small they can become appears to be related to the space required for their nervous and reproductive systems.World‚Äôs Smallest Insect Pays a Hefty Price for its Size Ptiliidae figures 1-9 note the feathered wings There are around 600 described species in 80 genera, but large numbers of specimens in collections await description and the true number of species is likely to be much higher than this.

Alas, with the collapse of the country in the late 1930s, Joseph Chronovski had to flee the city to Switzerland where he worked together with some of the more established Swiss watchmakers, until the war was over. In the 1950s, together with his whole family, he perfected the skills of watch-making whilst travelling around France, Germany and Switzerland. However, in the 1970s, due to the quartz revolution, the Chronovski family, like the rest of the European watchmakers, faced huge financial losses. With the industrialisation of East Asia, the Chronovskis set up manufacturing bases in Singapore and Hong Kong, maintaining the tradition of European watch-making, and in the process, creating a reputation for sturdy fashionable watches.

Early life Cirillo was born in East Harlem on July 4, 1929 to Colombo crime family caporegime of Neapolitan-Italian Alphonse Cirillo who served as a made man under Joseph Magliocco when it was the Profaci crime family. Alphonse was a first generation Italian-American immigrant from Potenza, Basilicata, Italy. In 1961, his father Alphonse was implicated in the attempted murder of Lawrence Gallo, a brother of fellow Profaci crime family soldier Joseph Gallo. Alphonse, Carmine Persico and Salvatore D'Ambrosio were the suspected attempted murderers, but Gallo refused to cooperate and no one was charged in the attack. His father died of unknown causes sometime before 1963 but was later made infamous after he was one of the hundreds of organized crime figures named in the testimony of mob turncoat Joseph Valachi. His father Alphonse through his lifetime had succeeded in never being arrested for a single criminal act except for \\"criminally receiving\\" as an early 1960s era organized crime mob family chart had stated. He is the brother of Gaetano \\"Wheeg\\" Cirillo and the father-in-law to mob associate John Caggiano. Dominick grew up on East 117th Street in East Harlem and as a teenager dropped out of Benjamin Franklin High School. He was an amateur boxer who boxed at neighborhood youth clubs and briefly pursued a career as a professional middleweight boxer. He was a husky man who stands at 5'10\\" and grew to be almost 200 pounds by the 1990s. He was a close personal friend and criminal partner of Vincent Gigante from a young age, who would later become heir to the Genovese crime family of which Dominick served in. Mob soldier Frank \\"Frank California\\" Condo and Frederico Giovanelli often laughed at Dominick's choice of clothing attire that was said to be reminiscent of Emmett Kelly's clown suits. In 1949, Dominick who at the time was a twenty-year-old welterweight was knocked out in three matches and had one match drawn before retiring. In 1953, at the age of twenty three he pleaded guilty to overseeing a clandestine heroin trafficking ring that was said to have grossed up to $20,000 a day. For his drug trafficking conviction he served nearly four years in Federal Correctional Institution, Milan in Milan, Michigan before returning to East Harlem. Between 1958 and 1965, he was arrested four times for consorting with known criminals, which were all later dismissed. He is married to an Italian-American woman named Bella who bore him two children, Nicholas and Anne Marie. Whenever fellow criminal associates would want to mention Cirillo's name they used an adapted clandestine sign language where they put their finger to their lips which would mean that they were discussing Dominick. He claimed to be a retired construction worker and said to live off of $510 a month in social security checks. He lived in the Country Club section of the northeast Bronx, near Pelham Bay Park and Eastchester Bay. Boxing career Dominick started out as a boxer with future Genovese crime family boss Thomas Eboli (\\"Tommy Ryan\\") as his manager and world heavyweight champion Tommy Ryan worked as his trainer. Cirillo gradually drifted towards the criminal side of the neighborhood, along with another boxer and associate, Vincent \\"Chin\\" Gigante. As a boxer he weighed between 151 and 156 pounds. He was an unsuccessful professional middleweight boxer in 1949. His first professional fight was against Matt Ward on March 9, 1949 in White Plains, New York which he lost. During his short lived boxing career he boxed sixteen rounds and lost three matches, withdrew from one and won just a single match. While he was a boxer Dominick weighed between 152 and 154 pounds. His last professional boxing match against Johnny Kohan on December 19, 1949 in Newark, New Jersey. He suffered two knock outs by Matt Ward on March 9, 1949 which was also his first professional match and once again by Emerson Charles on March 23, 1949. His one disqualified match was against Bobby Holt on April 6, 1949 at the Manhattan Center. Genovese crime family His first conviction came in 1952, when he was imprisoned on narcotics charges. In subsequent years, he grew closer to Gigante, who was seen, in the mid-1980s, as the de facto boss of the Genovese crime family. While Gigante served as boss on the streets, Cirillo served in a 'messenger' between Gigante and the other caporegimes of the Genovese crime family, as Cirillo's low-key style earned him his nickname \\"Quiet Dom\\" and helped him avoid the gaze of the authorities for many years.\\"The last Dom\\", William Bastone. The Village Voice. New York: Apr 29, 1997. Vol. 42, Iss. 17; pg. 36, 3 pgs Gigante's acting boss After Gigante was imprisoned in 1997 for racketeering and conspiracy charges, the leadership of the Genovese crime family passed to a committee/ruling panel, known as the \\"Administration,\\" ostensibly led by Cirillo.\\"Roving Brief:'Oddfather' business safe in family hands despite conviction\\", The Observer. London (UK): Jul 27, 1997. pg. 004 In this capacity, Cirillo represented the Genoveses in their dealings with the other Mafia families of New York City, though Gigante remained in overall charge of the family. In this way, Cirillo served as \\"acting boss\\" and was seen by US authorities as the most powerful member of the Genovese family. However, in 1998 Cirillo stepped down as acting boss because of a heart attack, and recovered his position as caporegime of the Genovese crime family that same year. Nick Cirillo missing Cirillo's son, Nicholas, who was not believed to be a made man, disappeared on May 9, 2004. Three weeks later his abandoned car was discovered, but Nicholas Cirillo has never been found. Investigators believe the younger Cirillo was killed after he insulted the son of acting Bonanno crime family boss Vincent \\"Vinny Gorgeous\\" Basciano and caporegime Dominick Cicale. It remains unclear whether this would have been allowed to happen without the explicit permission of Dominick Cirillo. Sources in 2010 say that Dom ordered the death of Nicholas on Mothers Day of 2004. On December 4, 2004, Randolph Pizzolo, who allegedly bragged about his role in the murder and disappearance of Nicholas, was found shot to death. Trial and guilty plea On October 18, 2005, Cirillo, who again was recognized as \\"acting boss\\" for Gigante, and four Genovese capos, Lawrence \\"Little Larry\\" Dentico, John \\"Johnny Sausage\\" Barbato and Anthony \\"Tico\\" Antico, pleaded guilty on charges of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy. Cirillo was sentenced to 48 months in prison and forced to pay $75,000 restitution. Reputed consigliere On August 22, 2008, the 79-year- old Cirillo was released from federal prison after serving more than three years. After being \\"acting boss\\" following the death of longtime family godfather Vincent \\"Chin\\" Gigante in December 2005, he is believed to be Consigliere of the Genovese family.

The Topper Toys brand was most used in print advertisement and television commercials (children's TV). It was founded and run by Henry Orenstein, a holocaust survivor. For boys, the Johnny Lightning and Johnny Seven O.M.A toys were the most popular; for girls, the Dawn Doll. Deluxe Reading dolls were sold in the 1950s - 1970s through supermarkets and are often referred to as Grocery Store Dolls. They were an inexpensive alternative to department store dolls, although of similar quality. Another successful toy for girls was the \\"Dream Kitchen\\" (circa 1961) which consisted of four 12-inch-tall colorful kitchen appliances, a kitchen table and four chairs. This toy was unique in that the sink worked with water, the oven contained batteries which revolved a plastic turkey on a spit inside the oven, the refrigerator had pull-out shelves, and the dishwasher also worked with water. Also included were scores of food boxes, cleaning supplies, food replica items, plates, utensils and more. The box proclaimed that it held \\"176 pieces.\\" The size of the set perfectly matched the size of Barbie, a toy doll which was wildly popular at that time. As of 2014, this kitchen toy set can be seen on sale (used) for up to $400. They were also the first company to manufacture Sesame Street dolls officially licensed by Children's Television Workshop and Henson Associates, until the company's financial problems caused CTW and Henson to terminate the contract in January 1973.Jones, Brian Jay. Jim Henson : the biography. New York: Ballantine Books. The toys were packaged in large, colorful boxes that could be easily seen atop grocery store shelves.

Following the Tito‚ÄìStalin Split in 1948, the RV i PVO was left with an aircraft inventory consisting of mostly Soviet aircraft. Unable to acquire new aircraft or spare parts for its existing fleet, the RV i PVO turned to its domestic aviation industry in order to create an indigenous design to fulfill the need for additional aircraft. The result was the S-49A, designed by Kosta Sivƒçev, Svetozar Popoviƒá and Slobodan Zrniƒá, on the basis of the pre-war Rogo≈æarski IK-3. The S-49A was surpassed by the improved S-49C, featuring an all-metal construction and a more powerful engine. A total of 45 S-49A and 113 S-49C were produced by the Ikarus Aircraft Factory in Zemun. The last aircraft were retired from RV i PVO service in 1960/61, having been replaced by more modern jet-powered aircraft. Development After the Resolution of Informbiro in 1948 and the resulting breakup with the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia was forced to rely on its domestic military industry. The same constructors that built the Rogozarski IK-3 (designers Ljubomir Ilic, Kosta Sivcev, Slobodan Zrnic) before the war, engineers Kosta Sivcev, Slobodan Zrnic and Svetozar K. Popovic, used existing technical documentation of the IK-3 to construct a new fighter aircraft, the Ikarus S-49. The first prototype of the S-49A flew in June 1949. The first operational aircraft were delivered to combat units at the beginning of 1950.  Description  The S-49A was of mixed construction, with Soviet built VK-105 engines which were no longer available after 1948. Therefore, it was decided to produce a new version of the aircraft powered by the similar French Hispano-Suiza 12Z-17 engine. Because of the bigger and heavier engine, the new aircraft had to be of all- metal construction with a much longer nose. While the aircraft was mainly built by Ikarus, the wings and tail were built by the SOKO factory in Mostar. The armament remained the same as with the Ikarus S-49A and it consisted of one 20 mm Mauser MG-151/20 autocannon produced by Germany during World War II and two 12.7 mm Colt Browning machine guns. In addition, under wing racks for two 50 kg bombs or four 127 mm HVAR missiles were provided.  Operational  At the beginning of 1952, the Ikarus S-49C was introduced into the units of the Yugoslav Air Force. About 130 S-49C were produced during the 1950s and they remained in service until 1961.

Location and construction Carvings of the temple According to the Hindu mythology the temple was built by Panch Pandava. Also another temple of king Bharata is built at Bhartgaon near Bhuleshwar temple. Jirnodhar of the Bhuleshwar temple was done during the period of 1230 AD during Yadava Rulers. The fort on which the temple is situated is called the Daulatmangal fort, also at times referred as Mangalgad. Black basalt (AA type) rock was brought to construct this temple which is different as compared to surrounding brownish color basalt which has high percentage of calcium (lime - Chuna). The fort was constructed in 1629 by Murar Jagdev who, in 1630, looted Pune. He then built the fort to keep a watch on the city.

Originally formed in 1912 as a Militia formation, the brigade was re-raised for service during World War I, elements of the brigade served at Gallipoli and in the trenches on the Western Front before being disbanded in 1919. In 1921, the brigade was re-raised as a unit of Australia's part-time military forces, based in the state of Victoria. During World War II the brigade served in the New Guinea and New Britain campaigns. Following the war, the brigade formed part of the 3rd Division, however, it was later reallocated to the 2nd Division, where it serves as a Reserve combined-arms formation including units and personnel from all corps of the Army including armoured, infantry, artillery, engineers, signals and ordnance. History The 4th Brigade traces its origins to 1912, when it was formed as a Militia brigade as part of the introduction of the compulsory training scheme, assigned to the 2nd Military District. At this time, the brigade's constituent units were located around regional New South Wales including Armidale, Inverell, Tamworth, Maitland, Newcastle and Adamstown.Australian Military Forces 1912, p. 18. World War I In September 1914, the brigade was re-raised as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), which was an all-volunteer force that was raised for service during World War I shortly after the outbreak of the war.Grey 2008, p. 80. Under the command of Colonel (later General Sir) John Monash, at that time the brigade consisted of four infantry battalions which were raised from all Australian states: the 13th (NSW), 14th (Vic), 15th (Qld/Tas) and 16th Battalions (SA/WA). 4th Brigade soldiers at Quinn's Post, May 1915 Following initial training at Broadmeadows in Victoria, they embarked for overseas in the second wave of Australian forces to be dispatched, leaving in December 1914. They arrived in Egypt in early 1915, where they were assigned to the New Zealand and Australian Division. In April 1915, the brigade participated in the ANZAC landing at Gallipoli, arriving on the second day as the division's reserve, before joining the eight-month campaign that followed. During the August Offensive, the brigade attacked Hill 971 and then, later, Hill 60. In December 1915 the decision was made to evacuate Gallipoli and subsequently the brigade was transported back to Egypt. Following this, the AIF underwent a period of reorganisation and expansion.Grey 2008, pp. 99‚Äì100. As a part of this process, the 4th Brigade provided a cadre of experienced personnel to the newly formed 12th Brigade.Grey 2008, p. 100. At the same time, the brigade was reassigned to the 4th Division.Bean 1941, p. 42. In June 1916, after spending a couple of months manning defences along the Suez Canal, the brigade, along with the rest of the 4th Division was transferred to Europe where they joined the war on the Western Front in France and Belgium. Assigned to the front line around Armenti√®res, they undertook their first operation on 2 July, undertaking an unsuccessful raid. During the next two years, the brigade rotated in and out of the line along with the rest of the 4th Division. In April 1917, the brigade took part in heavy fighting around Bullecourt where, on 11 April, they suffered heavy casualties, losing 2,339 men out of the 3,000 that were committed.Grey 2008, p. 104. In April 1918, the 4th Brigade was involved in significant fighting around Villers-Bretonneux, and eventually succeeded in liberating the town. The liberation was the third anniversary of ANZAC Day, 25 April 1918. In commemoration of the sacrifices made by Australians, in 1926 the main street of the town was renamed \\"Rue de Melbourne\\", while another was named \\"Rue de Victoria\\". The school, which was damaged during the fighting, was rebuilt with donations from Victorian school children and was subsequently called \\"Victoria School\\". Men of the 4th Brigade at Le Verguier, France in 1918. Later, in July, the 4th Brigade took part in the fighting around Le Hamel. The tactics used during the battle on 4 July 1918 were conceived by General John Monash and largely carried out by Australian infantrymen, along with a number of US troops. It was the scene of one of Allies greatest military victories during the war.Odgers 1988, p. 100. So great was this victory that French prime minister Georges Clemenceau came to address the Australian troops in the field: \\"When the Australians came to France, the French people expected a great deal of you, but we did not know that from the very beginning you would astonish the whole continent\\".Quoted in Odgers 1994, pp. 121‚Äì122. On 12 August 1918 Monash was knighted in the field by King George V. The 4th Brigade remained in the front line until late September 1918, taking part in the Hundred Days Offensive, including the fighting on 8 August, which was later described as the \\"Black Day\\" by the German commander, Erich Ludendorff.Odgers 1994, p. 122. In early October the rest of the Australian Corps was withdrawn from the line for rest and re- organisation in order to prepare for further operations.Odgers 1994, p. 127. As a result, the brigade did not take part in any further fighting before the Armistice in November 1918, after which the brigade's component infantry battalions began the demobilisation process and were eventually disbanded in 1919. During the course of the war, eight members of the brigade received the Victoria Cross. These were: Albert Jacka, Martin O'Meara, John Dwyer, Harry Murray, Henry Dalziel, Thomas Axford, Maurice Buckley and Dominic McCarthy. Inter war years In 1921, Australia's part-time military forces were re- organised to perpetuate the numerical designations and structure of the AIF formations that had existed during World War I.Grey 2008, p. 125. As a result, in May the 4th Brigade was re-raised as part of the Citizens Forces.Palazzo 2002, p. 63. Where possible the decision was made to raise the new formations in the recruiting areas from where the World War I units had drawn their personnel. Due to the fact that the 4th Brigade had consisted of battalions that had been drawn from a number of Australian states, upon re-forming when it was decided to base the brigade in Victoria‚Äîwith its headquarters in Prahran‚Äîonly one of its four component battalions had the numerical designation of units that had been assigned to the brigade previously. The four infantry battalions that were assigned to it at this time were: the 14th, 22nd, 29th and 46th Battalions. The brigade was assigned to the 3rd Division at this time. Initially, despite a level of war-weariness in Australia, numbers within the Citizens Force were maintained through voluntary recruitment and the compulsory training scheme, and due to strategic concerns around the expansion of Japanese naval power within the Pacific, there was a need to maintain a strong part-time military force. As a result, each infantry battalion within the brigade was able to report being at full strength, with over 1,000 men in each of the four battalions.Palazzo 2002, pp. 65‚Äì67. However, in 1922 following the conclusion of the Washington Naval Treaty, which theoretically resolved Australia's security concerns, the decision was made to reduce the Army's budget and reduce the authorised strength of each battalion to 409 men. The manpower situation grew more acute in 1929 when the Scullin Labor government suspended the compulsory training scheme and replaced it with a voluntary \\"Militia\\".Palazzo 2001, p. 110. This decision, coupled with the economic downturn of the Great Depression resulted in further scarcity of recruits for the brigade's infantry battalions and, as a result, the decision was made to amalgamate two of the battalions,Keogh 1965, p. 44. the 22nd and the 29th, to form the 29th/22nd Battalion.Palazzo 2002, p. 69. Throughout the 1930s, the situation was characterised by poor attendance and limited training opportunities.Palazzo 2002, p. 76. This resulted in further changes in the brigade's composition, and by 1934, the 14th Battalion had been reassigned to the 2nd Brigade.Kuring 2004, p. 111. The manpower situation, however, began to improve in 1936 and then again in 1938 when tensions in Europe increased concerns about the possibility of another war. The result of this was a concerted recruitment drive and more funding for training courses and camps, which in turn resulted in more enlistments.Palazzo 2002, pp. 72‚Äì86. As a result of the improved attendance within the 4th Brigade, 29th/22nd Battalion was split in August 1939 and the 22nd and 29th Battalions were reconstituted in their own right. World War II At the outbreak of World War II, the brigade was a part-time formation of the Militia, based in Victoria. As the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) precluded the deployment of Militia formations outside of Australian territory to fight, the Australian government decided to raise a separate force for dispatch to Europe and the Middle East. This force was known as the Second Australian Imperial Force.Grey 2008, p. 146. As a result, it was decided that the Militia would be used to improve the country's overall readiness for war through undertaking periods of continuous training, undertaking defensive duties and managing the training of recruits called up following the re-establishment of the compulsory training scheme in January 1940. Soldiers from the 29th/46th Battalion evacuate a wounded comrade following fighting around Gusika on New Guinea, November 1943 In September 1939, the brigade consisted of three infantry battalions‚Äîthe 22nd, 29th and 46th Battalions‚Äîand it was initially assigned to the 3rd Division. Following Japan's entry into the war in December 1941, however, the 4th Brigade was mobilised for war service and raised to a higher state of training at Bonegilla, Victoria.McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2061. At this time the brigade was assigned a reserve response force role, and in March 1942, the brigade moved to Warwick, Queensland, and from there to Chermside to take up defensive positions around the north of Brisbane. Later in the year, the brigade was reorientated to defend the southern approaches to Brisbane. Later in the year, the brigade moved to Forest Glen, Queensland on the Sunshine Coast.McKenzie-Smith 2018, pp. 2061‚Äì2062. In March 1943, the brigade was transferred to the 5th Division and it was deployed to New Guinea, being dispatched to Milne Bay to relieve the 7th Brigade.Long 1963, p. 577. Later, the brigade took part in the Huon Peninsula campaign, and it was amongst the first of the Militia brigades to see action against the Japanese at Guiska. At that time, the brigade consisted of the 22nd, 29th/46th and 37th/52nd Infantry Battalions. Throughout 1943 and 1944 the brigade was transferred between the 5th and 9th Division a number of times, taking part in the New Guinea campaign. In September 1944, the brigade returned to Australia for reorganisation and training before taking part in the New Britain campaign. Due to a shortage of shipping, the brigade's deployment was delayed and they did not land until January 1945.Long 1963, p. 251. Following this, the brigade came under the command of the 11th Division,McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2051. and helped to undertake a containment campaign against the Japanese forces on the island until the end of the war in August 1945,Long 1963, p. 261. although only one battalion, the 37th/52nd was deployed forward to Ea Ea, while the rest remained at Wunung. Post war, the brigade assisted with occupation duties and oversaw the Japanese surrender around Rabaul.McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2063. Post World War II In 1948, following the completion of the demobilisation process, Australia's part-time military forces were re- organised under the guise of the Citizens Military Force.Grey 2008, p. 200. Upon re-formation, the 4th Brigade was assigned to the 3rd Division and consisted of three infantry battalions: the 5th, 6th and 8th/7th.Palazzo 2002, p. 163. Throughout the Cold War period which followed, the composition of the brigade changed a number of times as the role of part-time military forces evolved. Initially, post war service was voluntary, however, in 1951 national service was instituted and this increased the size of the CMF units.Grey 2008, p. 205. During this time, due to increased manpower and resources, the brigade was able to achieve full manning and equipment scales and, as a result, in 1959, formed the basis of a 3,500-man combined arms exercise undertaken at Puckapunyal.Palazzo 2002, pp. 167‚Äì168. Nevertheless, the national service scheme was suspended in 1960, due to the large amount of resources required to administer it.Grey 2008, p. 207. At the same time, the introduction of the Pentropic divisional establishment saw the disbandment or amalgamation of many infantry battalions as regional-based battalions were formed into multi- battalion State-based regiments.Grey 2008, p. 228. This saw the adoption of the five battalion division and resulted in the disbandment of the old three battalion brigade formations.Kuring 2004, p. 262. In late 1964, however, the decision was made to end the experiment with the Pentropic establishment,McNeill 1993, p. 22. partly because of the difficulties it created with allied interoperability. Early the following year the brigade formations were re-established, although they were designated \\"task forces\\" instead of brigades.McCarthy 2003, p. 131.Blaxland 1989, p. 108. By 1976, due to limited resources and manpower the brigade's parent formation, the 3rd Division, had become a largely hollow structure. As a result, the division's headquarters were merged with the 4th Task Force's headquarters as the 3rd Division was redesignated as the \\"3rd Division Field Force Group\\" and the 4th Task Force ceased to exist.Palazzo 2002, pp. 190‚Äì191. On 1 July 1981 the formation was reraised as the \\"4th Task Force\\", however, in 1982 it was renamed as the \\"4th Brigade\\". In 1981 the brigade's infantry battalions were the 1st and 2nd Battalions, Royal Victoria Regiment (RVR). In December 1982 the 5th/6th Battalion was raised by establishing a new BHQ and utilising some of the 1 RVR companies. Until 1987 the brigade had three infantry battalions, 1 RVR, 2 RVR and 5/6 RVR. During this period 2 RVR was renamed 8/7 RVR. In 1987 the brigade was reduced to just two infantry battalions, namely 5/6 RVR and 8/7 RVR and supporting arms. In the early 1990s the brigade was assigned to the 2nd Division. In 1991, following a force structure review, the 3rd Division was disbanded and its units were placed under the 4th Brigade's command. As a result, in the late 1990s it had a vital asset protection mobilisation role as part of the \\"Protective Force\\" in the Tindal area of the Northern Territory.Palazzo 2002, p. 194. Current structure and recent operations Currently, the 4th Brigade is headquartered at Simpson Barracks in Melbourne. It consists of about 2,400 personnel, who are based in a number of locations in Melbourne and regional Victoria. The brigade currently consists of the following units: *Headquarters 4th Brigade *4th/19th Prince of Wales' Light Horse, Royal Australian Armoured Corps *5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment *8th/7th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment *22nd Engineer Regiment, Royal Australian Engineers *108th Signals Squadron; and *4th Combat Service Support Battalion. Monash University Regiment (MonUR) and the 2nd/10th Medium Regiment, which had previously been assigned to the brigade, were removed from the Australian Army's Order of Battle in 2012. The Officer Cadet Company of MUR was renamed Monash University Company, and the artillery was amalgamated with 5/6 RVR as the 2nd/10th Light Battery, employing mortars rather than field artillery. The 4th Combat Engineer Regiment (4 CER) was removed from the Australian Army Order of Battle in 2013. 4 CER and 22nd Construction Regiment (22 Const Regt) were amalgamated in 2013 to form the 22nd Engineer Regiment (22 ER).

The region is divided into two Local Government Areas, Isoko North (headquartered at Ozoro) and Isoko South (headquartered at Oleh). History This region used to be a part of the defunct \\"Mid-West Region\\". It later became part of Bendel State, before Bendel State was split to form Edo and Delta states. Geography and climate=Location The Isoko region is located in Delta State of modern Nigeria. Local climatic conditions Isoko region is in the tropical rain forest area of the Niger-delta. The region experiences high rainfall and high humidity most of the year. The climate is equatorial and is marked by two distinct seasons. the dry and rainy seasons. The dry season lasts from about November to April and is significantly marked by the cool \\"harmarttan\\" dusty haze from the north-east winds. The rainy season spans May to October with a brief dry spell in August. Towns in Isoko Some major towns in Isoko region are: { width=100% - valign =\\"top\\" width=25% *Ada *Aradhe *Araya *Aviara *Bethel *Ekiugbo-Iyede *Ellu *Emede *Emevor *Enhwe *Erowa width=25% *Ibrede *Idheze *Igbide *Igbuku *Irri *Itebiege *Ivori *Ivrogbo *Oghara-Iyede *Oghenerurie-Iyede width=25% *Iyede-Ame *Ofagbe *Okpe Isoko *Oleh *Olomoro *Onogboko *Orie *Otor-Owhe *Ovrode width=25% *Owhe *Owhelogbo *Otigho *Oyede *Ozoro *Umeh *Uro *Utue *Uzere } Economy The main economic activity is food crop farming. And the staple food crops include cassava and yams. There is also the widespread production of palm oil and palm kernels. Limited amount of hunting and fishing is also done. Women form a large proportion of the farming population. They also engage in trade of food crops for cash to meet other basic household needs. On market days, it is common to see Isoko women peddling their assorted goods around neighboring villages. Cassava is the source of most of the foods consumed by the Isoko people. Garri, starch meal (Ozi), Egu are cassava derivatives. Food crop production has been declining rapidly recently. This has been largely attributed to soil damage resulting from frequent crude oil spills from pipelines belonging to some of the major oil producing companies (including Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), whose pipeline network transverse the landscape). This has led to large-scale frustrations with Shell Petroleum Development Company, and has resulted in skirmishes and, recently, kidnappings for ransom in some neighboring communities. Demographics There is no definitive population census figure on the region of Isoko and, indeed, most of Nigeria. The various Nigerian census figures have been controversial and are deemed unsupportable.  Religion  The Isoko people are predominantly Christians. Traditional worship still thrives despite the strong onslaught of Christian principles. \\"·ªågh·∫πn·∫π\\" is the word for God. Although it can be generally termed as traditional religion, there are however some practices that are peculiar to some Isoko community. For instance in the town of Emevor, some important festivals like \\"Idhu and Owhoru\\" which are celebrated annually and biannually. Transport Popular mode of transport is the motorcycle and bicycle. Inter-city travel is by bus or car. Education Several secondary schools and postsecondary schools exist in the region. The Isoko people know the value of education and encourage their young ones to attend school. The Isoko people have been known to be very passionate about location of education infrastructure in their communities, believing it is a mark of progress. Early emphasis was on teacher-training schools and this led to a glut of teachers in the community. This is rapidly changing as opportunities offered by other professions are recognized. Major post-primary educational institutions in the region include Notre Dame College, Ozoro; James Welch Grammar School [Best school in the Isoko land], Emevor; Saint Joseph's Teacher's College, Ozoro; Saint Michael's College Oleh; Anglican Grammar School, Ozoro, Ofagbe Technical College, Ofagbe, and several more. Post-secondary schools include a campus of the Delta State University at Oleh and the Delta State Polytechnic at Ozoro.

He is known for his critiques of the pillars of contemporary anthropological theory‚Äîwholesale cultural determinism, radical cultural relativism, and virtually limitless cultural diversity‚Äîand for his emphasis on the theoretical importance of unconscious desires and beliefs in the study of stability and change in social and cultural systems, particularly in respect to the family, politics, and religion. Explicated in numerous theoretical publications, they are empirically exemplified in monographs based on his fieldwork in Ifaluk atoll in Micronesia, an Israeli kibbutz,Spiro, Melford E.(1956) Kibbutz:Venture in Utopia.

(1971) Buddhism and Society: A Great Tradition and its Burmese Vicissitudes. New York: Harper and Row. He was a significant figure in a series of debates over cultural relativism and postmodern theory among American cultural anthropologists in the 1980s and early 1990s, in which he consistently argued for the importance of the comparative method and the appreciation of universal cultural and psychological processes. Spiro received his B.A. from the University of Minnesota, where he majored in philosophy, following which he studied at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. Having developed an interest in culture theory, he explored this interest by enrolling in the anthropology department at Northwestern University, where he worked with Melville Herskovits and A. Irving Hallowell, and received his PhD in 1950. He taught at Washington University (St Louis), University of Connecticut, University of Washington, and University of Chicago before moving In 1968 to the University of California, San Diego where he was invited to found the department of anthropology. He received postgraduate training in psychoanalysis at the San Diego Psychoanalytic Center and practiced as a lay analyst, additionally overseeing a course series at UCSD that exposed graduate students in anthropology to psychiatric training. Spiro became professor emeritus at UCSD in 1990, but continued teaching for another decade. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served terms as president of the American Ethnological Society and the Society for Psychological Anthropology (SPA) and was one of the founders of the SPA's journal, Ethos. Mel Spiro was married for 62 years to Audrey Spiro, with whom he had two sons.http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/melford_e._spiro_department_of_anthropology_founder_dies He died in La Jolla, CA, in October 2014 of natural causes.

Home to Lord Shankaranarayana Temple and many other small sacred Hindu temples, it has a long history of its own. History Legend has it that Kroda Muni, a Hindu saint, had his ashram here and was doing 'thapassu' here for the good of the world, thus the name Krodasharama, which then converted into Kodavooru. Nature and landscape Being a typical coastal town, it is surrounded by coconut trees and paddy fields which contribute to its fine appearance during the monsoon. Tourism *Kodavooru is just a kilometer away from Malpe, a Karnataka coastal tourist delight, with a beautiful beach and St. Mary's Island. * People can also visit the Temples in Belkale, Keremata, Kambalakatte, Mandechavadi and Kanangi Mutt. *Apart from the above attractions, Kodavooru contributes to the cultural richness of the city of Udupi in having its own traditional Bharatanatya school known as NRITYA NIKETANA. Dance enthusiasts from various parts of the world visit this institute in order to learn Bharatanatya. Culture * Belonging to the culturally rich district of Udupi, Kodavooru features a variety of arts and cultural events. * Yakshagana is a popular form of musical dramatic art which is enjoyed here. Kodavooru is home to many prominent yakshagana artists. * Hulivesha kunitha, when performers paint their bodies with tiger stripes and dance to popular Sandalwood Kannada tunes, is one of the most exciting moments one can experience during the days of Krishna Janmaashtami, (the Birthday Of Lord Krishna) * Kodavooru is also a very significant place for believers of Dvaita, the system of philosophy founded by Shree Madhvacharya. According to a traditional story,Biographies of Great Indians Shree Madhva visited Kodavooru to pray to Lord Shankaranarayana when he was just three years old. Important events *The annual car festival of Lord Shankaranarayana. (It is performed for 9 days and consists of the Rathotsava i.e. the Chariot seve, Pooje furformed under different Ashwatha Trees in different places of the village of Kattepooje. This is the only time Lord Shankaranarayana is brought out of the temple to the devotee's house. The Lord is carried in the Silver Pallakki and is taken to the devotee's home.) *Lakshadeepothsava (This is the pooje in which the temple as well as the temple street is filled with the Deepa.) *This temple is also dedicated to the god like Ganapathi. (There are two Ganapathis, one inside the temple and one near the river which flows behind the temple, popularly known as \\"Tudekatte ganapathi\\" in Tulu, Durgamata, Lord shiva, Raghavendra mata, Nagabana, Brahmadeva, Nandi. A unique feature of this temple town of Udupi is that all the temples have only one nandi. Kodavooru temple is the only temple which has two nandis. So, beside the car festival of Lord Shankaranarayana, all the Festivals such as Ganesha Chauti (Gana homa's), Navaratri (especially Cahndika homa's) are performed here. *Maari pooje, which occurs more than twelve times in a year out of that Big Maari Pooje occurs twice a year, is also an interesting ritual which attracts a large number of devotees around the town. Language * Tulu are the most widely spoken languages along with English. However, Kannada is the official language of the state. Industry Being a small town, it depends on agriculture as the main source of income. A considerable number of people here also rely on the fisheries which are supplied by the fishing harbour at the nearby town of Malpe. Beedi (a type of cigarette) Industries and Milk Producers Unions contribute a considerable degree of industry to the city. Transportation Kodavooru has reliable public transportation with buses connecting from places like Garadimajalu, Santhekatte to Udupi and Malpe. Banking and finance Canara Bank - Kodavooru Branch and Kodavooru Vyavasaya Seva Sahakari Sangha (a co-operative) bank operate here.

The river valley is formed by the Krumovitsa River and the Djushun River together with the surrounding low mountain slopes. Geography and geology The rivers flow through deep canyons and open valleys, with the vegetation along the riverbanks dominated by Alnus, Salix, Populus, Rubus, Rosa and Tamarix. Dry grassland, scrub and broadleaved forests cover the neighbouring hills. The forests are dominated by Quercus, Carpinus and Mediterranean tree species. Juniperus is predominant in the sclerophyllous scrub. Land-uses are extensive rearing of sheep and cattle, hunting and forestry, but the area is becoming progressively depopulated due to local emigration. The area includes the valleys in the middle course of the Krumovitsa River and its tributary Djushun Dere with the adjacent hills and slopes of the Eastern Rhodopes. It covers the sections of the Krumovitsa between the village of Gorna Kula and the mouth of the Djushun Dere, from where it reaches the grounds of the village of Chal to the east. The Krumovitsa river valley in this region is between 300 and 1000 m wide, at places occupied entirely by the sandy riverbed itself. There are differently expressed belts of riverine tree vegetation mainly of poplars (Populus spp.), willows (Salix spp.), black alder (Alnus glutinosa), etc. It is mixed with shrub vegetation of blackberry (Rubus spp.), dog rose, etc. At many places shrubs, mainly of Tamarix spp., and grasses grow in the riverbed itself. The Krumovitsa banks are often steep, covered with low rocks. Its valley is occupied by farmland patches. The Djushun Dere river valley is mostly narrow and cuts deeply in volcanic rocks with very steep cliffs along the riverbed, waterfalls and small caves. The vegetation along its banks is scarce and dominated by shrub species. Both rivers have a strongly fluctuating water level ‚Äì very high in February‚ÄìMarch and almost none in July‚ÄìAugust (except in isolated pools). Most of the area includes low-mountain ridges and slopes. Its bigger part is treeless but the most south-eastern regions are covered by old broadleaved forest of Quercus frainetto, Quercus dalechampii, at places mixed with Carpinus orientalis. Secondary forests have replaced the old ones that have been cut in the recent decades. Typical for the slopes and ridges of the two valleys are the numerous rocks, rock complexes and crests, along with the extensive areas covered by shrub formations of Mediterranean type, dominated by Juniperus oxycedrus, etc. There are many stony sections, overgrown with grass vegetation. Birds Krumovitsa river Krumovitsa River Valley is one of the most important areas in Bulgaria for breeding black storks (Ciconia nigra) and Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus). Other nationally significant populations breeding at site are the short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus) (1 pair), Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) (1‚Äì2 pairs) and the olive-tree warbler (Hippolais olivetorum) (2‚Äì5 pairs). Krumovitsa Important Bird Area supports 136 bird species. Sixty-four are species of European conservation concern (SPEC), two of them being included in category SPEC 1 as globally threatened, 18 in SPEC 2, and 44 in SPEC 3 as species threatened in Europe. The area is of global importance, as it is a representative biome for the Mediterranean zone. Seven biome-restricted species, typical for the Mediterranean zone out of nine established in Bulgaria, occur there: black-eared wheatear (Oenanthe hispanica), olive-tree warbler (Hippolais olivetorum), subalpine warbler (Sylvia cantillans), Sardinian warbler (Sylvia melanocephala), rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer), masked shrike (Lanius nubicus) and black-headed bunting (Emberiza melanocephala). Krumovitsa is one of the few places in Bulgaria where the cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) still can be observed. Krumovitsa provides suitable habitats for 46 species, included in Annex 2 of the Biodiversity Act, which need special conservation measures. Thirty-eight of them are listed also in Annex I of the Birds Directive and more than half of them breed in the region in significant populations. The region of the Krumovitsa is one of the most important sites in the country on a European Union scale for the breeding black stork (Ciconia nigra), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus) and olive-tree warbler. Conservation issues The rural depopulation has led to decreases in available food resources (livestock carrion) for vultures in the region. Uncontrolled hunting and fishing are further threats. Threats A crab from the river Three major threats to the area are recognized: #Abandonment/reduction of land management (high importance) #Intensified forest management (medium importance) #Unsustainable exploitation (medium importance) Krumovitsa is an area sensitive to the human activities related mainly to traditional livestock in the region. Emigration of people, resulting in a decrease in domestic animals and in dead animals in nature, significantly limits the possibilities for vultures to find food. Poaching and use of poison against wolves directly affect raptors, and especially vultures. Existing electrical power lines are dangerous for raptors, especially for young birds. Direct threats to birds are caused also by rock climbing, gliding, and hang-gliding, taking chicks and eggs from the nests. Forest habitats are threatened by burning and natural fires, afforestation with non-indigenous species, as well as illegal cutting of trees especially along the rivers. Reduction in grazing and conversion of pastures to arable lands cause loss of grassland habitats for birds. Investment projects related to the gold mining industry constitute a serious threat, which could cause destruction and fragmentation of habitats on a large scale, disturbance to breeding birds, as well as river pollution. One of the potential threats both to the habitats and to the birds in the area is the development of wind turbine farms. During recent decades tourism has begun to develop more intensively, which could cause negative impact on birds and habitats if the process is not regulated. Legal protection The territory of Krumovitsa is not protected by national nature conservation legislation. Only two small natural monuments are designated for protection of landscapes. In 1997 the area was designated as Important Bird Area by BirdLife International. About 10% of Krumovitsa overlaps with the Arda Valley Corine Site, which was designated in 1998 because of its European value for habitats, rare and threatened plant and animal species, including birds.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 318 - 319. History=Origins of the Clan Craigievar Castle, seat of the Chief of Clan Sempill The name Sempill has been known in Renfrewshire since the twelfth century but its origins are obscure. The suggestions that it is a corruption of 'St Paul' seems unlikely. It also seems an unlikely suggestion that the first person of the name had a reputation for being simple or humble. In 1246 Robert de Sempill witnessed a charter to Paisley Abbey. Later as a chamberlain he also witnessed a charter of the Earl of Lennox. Wars of Scottish Independence During the Wars of Scottish Independence Robert de Sempill's two sons, Robert and Thomas, supported king Robert the Bruce and they were both rewarded for their services. The elder son received all of the lands around Largs in Ayrshire which had been confiscated from the Balliols. The younger son, Thomas, received a grant for half of the lands of Longniddry. Prior to 1344 the lands of Eliotsoun, which became the territorial designation of the chief were acquired. 15th and 16th centuries Sir Thomas Sempill fell fighting in support of King James III of Scotland at the Battle of Sauchieburn in June 1488. His only son, John Sempill, inherited the family estates. John was made Lord Sempill during the reign of King James IV of Scotland. In 1505 John founded the Collegiate church of Lochwinnoch. He also rebuilt the castle at the eastern end of the loch which he renamed Castle Sempill. He was killed fighting for the king at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. (See: John Sempill, 1st Lord Sempill). John was succeeded by his son William who obtained a charter to the lordship with the assistance of the Regent Albany. William favored the betrothal of the child Mary, Queen of Scots to the son of Henry VIII of England. William's son, Robert Sempill, was constable of the king's Douglas Castle and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. Robert was sometimes called the Great Lord Sempill and supported the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise who was the widow of James V of Scotland. Robert's castle was attacked and seized for his opposition to the Scottish Reformation. He was a faithful supporter of Queen Mary until the death of Lord Darnley and he afterwards joined those who promoted Mary's son as King James VI. He fought against the queen at the Battle of Carberry Hill and was one of the signatories on the warrant for the queen to be held in Loch Leven Castle. He also led the vanguard of the Regent Moray's army at the Battle of Langside in 1568 and was rewarded with a charter to the abbey lands of Paisley. After the Regent was murdered in 1570 Sempill was imprisoned for a year. (See: Robert Sempill, 3rd Lord Sempill). Robert's son, John Sempill, was castigated by John Knox as Sempill the dancer. John was accused of treason and attempting to assassinate Regent Morton and was sentenced to death by hanging, drawing and quartering. However the sentence was commuted to imprisonment and he was later released. In 1572 John was succeeded by his elder half brother, Robert Sempill as the fourth Lord Sempill. This Robert assisted in the baptism of Prince Henry in 1594 and personally attended on the queen at a banquet that was held in celebration in the great hall of Stirling Castle. Robert was also appointed as a Privy Councillor by James VI of Scotland and was sent as an ambassador to Spain. However later Robert would not renounce the Catholic faith and held no more public offices. (See: Robert Sempill, 4th Lord Sempill). 17th century Robert Sempill, 6th Lord Sempill supported the royalist cause during the Civil War but was fined under the Commonwealth as a result. The 8th Lord Sempill embraced the Protestant faith. He was the first Lord Sempill to sit in Parliament since the reign of Mary Queen of Scots. He died in 1684 and was succeeded by his sister Anne Sempill. 18th century & Jacobite risings Anne's eldest son was Francis, the tenth Lord Sempill. He was a strong opponent of the union with England. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his brother John Sempill. John Sempill supported the Hanoverian-British Government during the Jacobite rising of 1715. John also died unmarried and the title passed to his brother, Hew (Hugh), who was a professional soldier. Hew Sempill had made a reputation for fighting on the continent. In 1746 he led his regiment on the side of the British Government at the Battle of Culloden, on the left wing of the Government army.

The vast majority of the pupils of the school stem from the Heads of the Valleys, serving parishes from Aberdare, Hirwaun, Merthyr Tydfil, Merthyr Vale, Gurnos, Dowlais, Ebbw Vale, Tredegar and Rhymney. The school serves a catchment area of economic disadvantage which is a result of the decline of heavy industry, especially mining and steelmaking in the South Wales Valleys and the surrounding areas. Bishop Hedley is a member of the Eco-Schools. As a school, it has gained a bronze, silver and a 1st green flag. History Bishop Hedley was established in 1967 due to the growing need to cater for the large populace of Catholic youth aged 11‚Äì18 in the Merthyr Tydfil and Heads of the Valleys area. However, the school welcomes pupils regardless of their religious background. The school was named after John Cuthbert Hedley, Bishop of Newport, who opened the first Roman Catholic Church (St. Illtyd's) in the Merthyr Valley in 1863. The school expanded to a second phase in 1973.Bishop Hedley Catholic High School Subjects and curriculum In KS3, pupil partake in English, Mathematics, Science (in year 9, this changes to chemistry, physics and biology as they start GCSE Science early), RE, ICT, Welsh, French, Art, History, Geography, Music, Design & Technology and Drama. In KS4, pupils study English Language, English Literature, Science, Additional Science, Mathematics, Welsh (Short Course), RE, and PSE. Pupils then have three choices out of ICT, Welsh, French, Art, History, Geography, Music, Design & Technology, Drama, Business Studies. Students are offered a 'boost class' in Year 11 if they choose not to do GCSE Full Course Welsh at the end of Year 9 so that they can change from the Short Course to Full Course. This has been a success and continues to be a success. It is run by the Head of Welsh, Mrs. Elaine Walters. In Years 9‚Äì11, Science is taught separately as Chemistry, Biology and Physics. The EdExcel Science 360 specification is used at KS4 ‚Äì but it is examined as a GCSE Science and Additional Science course. Shortly, the school hopes to offer the three sciences separately. In years 7 and 8, Spotlight Science is used. Facilities Bishop Hedley has a main hall, dance and drama studio, pottery room, gymnasium, two sports hall, football/rugby field, hockey pitch, three yards, three design and technology rooms, learning resources centre, music rehearsal room, two new 21st century science suites and 5 I.C.T. resources rooms (excluding I.C.T services in other areas of the school e.g., music room, LRC etc.) The MFL department has a specific room on the top floor. There is also a specific SEN and EAL area. The MFL department has a French assistant from France every academic year to help GCSE and AS/A2/A level pupils who are taking French. This assistant also improves their own teaching and language skills. Classrooms are well-equipped, with every classroom having an electronic projector. This also aids the science department, which uses an on-board textbook for GCSE Science and GCSE Additional Science, as part of the EdExcel specification. The school has also invested in a Pisys system, which has proved a great investment for staff and pupils alike. The facilities at Bishop Hedley were improved. 70% of the exterior of phase 2 is now completed, with the new colour red. Progress continues on completing the refurbishment of the exterior of phase 2. Bishop Hedley has also recently improved phase 1 main hall. Recent school report Estyn inspected Bishop Hedley in November 2007 and said \\"The school has many good features, of which some are outstanding.\\"Estyn report November 2007 Religious education is inspected separately but at the same time. This was another positive report which said \\"The Catholicity of the school pervades all that goes on and provides a rich environment where pupils excel academically and grow spiritually. The school is highly effective in promoting Catholic values.\\" It also said that \\"pupils at Key Stage 4 achieve high standards\\".RCADC report November 2007 The report from Estyn in 2018 judged that standards, wellbeing and attitudes to learning and also care support and guidance were excellent, while teaching and learning experiences and also leadership and management were good. 40th anniversary Bishop Hedley High School celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2008. The culmination of various celebrations was a mass held on Tuesday 24 June 2008. In the afternoon, Father Mike Evans led a mass for the pupils, while in the evening Archbishop Peter Smith led the celebrations. Pupils, staff, parish priests, parishioners, councillors, representatives of officers from Merthyr County Borough Council, representatives of our partnerships with external organisations and past pupils celebrated the mass with the Archbishop. Music for the mass was composed by Mr. Peter Lewis, Head of Music and a tapestry was displayed which had been created by Mrs. A. Richards, Mrs. G. Jones and Year 8 pupils. During the mass, pupils sang and the bidding prayers were read in the different languages of the school community ‚Äì Polish, Portuguese, Filipino, Welsh and English. The orchestra accompanied all the hymns. At the end of the mass the Archbishop blessed all the crosses from the classrooms in the school. He also blessed the large cross in the Main Hall, formed from individual ceramic tiles joined together to form one large cross, which was created by the ceramicist Christine Chivers and current students. Community and charity events Bishop Hedley High School is a primary location for the 3G's community group. Yearly, there is also an annual OAP party for the residents in the local area. The School also has a Charity Day every term in the school year. The last charity day raised over ¬£1,100 for three charities ‚Äì the Mayor's appeal, Breast cancer care and to help with the purchase of a land-rover in Tanzania. Drama Department A successful modern twist on an old classic saw pupils in Year 8 and 9 praised by the manager of the Shakespeare Festival when they performed Macbeth at the Taliesin Theatre in Swansea. Their contemporary version featured dancing witches who rocked around the cauldron to songs such as \\"Soulja Boy\\", \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and \\"Rock Star\\". The idea was to make the play more accessible and enjoyable for teenagers. The cast was praised for their mature performances and the manager of the Shakespeare Festival recommended that some of them try for the National Youth Theatre when they are 16.

The town which grew up nearby is now named Whitland after it. It was widely known as Ty Gwyn ar Daf, meaning White House on the Taf, in reference to the country house originally built here before it became a monastic settlement which was known under that name. It is most associated with being the place where Hywel Dda drew up his laws around 940. It functioned as a Cistercian monastery between the 12th and 16th centuries. History=The house of Ty Gwyn ar Daf Ty Gwyn ar Daf was once the occasional residence of Hywel Dda in the 10th century and a grand national council was held here around the year 940. The council had the purpose of compiling and enacting the code of laws, which are still known as \\"the Laws of Hywel Dda.\\" Hywel's laws were deposited at Dinefwr Castle later in the tenth century after being drawn up at Ty Gwyn. In order to give greater solemnity to this convocation, and to implore the divine wisdom to assist their counsels, the king remained here with his whole court during Lent, in the constant exercise of prayer and other acts of devotion. Whitland Abbey Soon after the destruction of the monastery of Bangor- Iscoed, in North Wales, and the slaughter and dispersion of the brethren of that extensive establishment by the Northumbrian Saxons, a religious society was settled at this place under the auspices of Paulinas, son of Urien Reged, a disciple of St. Germanus, in which originated the abbey of Albalanda, or Whitland, afterwards erected near the site, and called by the Welsh, after the name of the former establishment, Ty Gwyn ar Taf. However, this Abbey is now known not to have been founded in Whitland at all. Whitland was founded on 16 September 1140 by monks from the mother house of Clairvaux.Cowley, F.G. 1977. The Monastic Order in South Wales, 1066-1349 University of Wales Press. In 1144 it was located at Little Trefgarn near Haverfordwest. It moved to Whitland in about 1155, a site having been granted by John of Torrington. The abbey founded a number of daughter houses in Wales, starting with an abortive foundation at Abbeycwmhir in 1143. In 1164 a group of monks from Whitland founded Strata Florida Abbey. Strata Marcella Abbey was founded from Whitland in 1170, and in 1176 Cwmhir Abbey was re-founded. Whitland Abbey was originally a Cambro-Norman foundation, but soon came under the control and patronage of Rhys ap Gruffudd, Prince of Deheubarth. It is related in the Welsh annals that Cadwaladr, brother of Owain Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales, during the disputes which arose between him and his nephews, the sons of Owain, entrusted the custody of his newly erected Cynvael Castle to the abbot of Ty Gwyn ar Taf, who defended it with obstinate valour against the assaults of the young princes by whom it was besieged. After a determined resistance, protracted till the walls of the castle were beaten down, and the whole of the garrison either slain or wounded, the abbot effected his escape from the ruins, through the assistance of some friends in the camp of the enemy, and retired into his monastery. It was at Whitland that Rhys's son, Maredudd, ended his days as a monk after he had been blinded by order of King Henry II of England when a hostage in England. It became an important cultural centre for south-west Wales and a strong supporter of the Welsh struggle to remain free of English domination. The monastery, which was dedicated to St. Mary, and had an establishment of eight monks, continued to flourish till the dissolution, at which time its revenue was estimated at ¬£153. 17. 2.; and its site was granted, in the 36th of Henry VIII, to Henry Audley and John Cordel. A forge was later established on the site, reputed to be the oldest in Carmarthenshire. This and the Victorian house built on the site came into the possession of the Yelverton family when William Henry Yelverton married the heiress of John Morgan, the previous owner. It later passed by marriage to the Blake family, who were given royal permission to adopt the additional name of Yelverton.

Keys enlisted the help of Charles Lindbergh to design a transcontinental network to get government airmail contracts. Lindbergh established numerous airports across the country in this effort. Lindbergh with TAT executives History Paperweight honoring the opening of transcontinental rail-air passenger service. On July 7, 1929, transcontinental trips began. It initially offered a 48-hour coast to coast trip (trains by night, and planes by day in nine flights), with the first leg on the Pennsylvania Railroad overnight from New York City to Columbus, Ohio. There, passengers boarded a Ford Trimotor aircraft at what is now John Glenn Columbus International Airport, and flew to Waynoka, Oklahoma. Then, passengers caught the Santa Fe Railway for an overnight trip to Clovis, New Mexico, where they would take a second Ford Trimotor flight to Los Angeles. One-way fare from New York to Los Angeles was $352. Cynics were to deride its TAT abbreviation as \\"Take A Train.\\" TAT Ford 5-AT-B \\"City of Columbus\\" flown by Lindbergh The Ford Trimotor service was one of the first to offer meals en route, provided by the Fred Harvey Company. It was also one of the first to be geared toward passenger service (while most airlines at the time were focused on transporting air mail). In its first eighteen months of operation, the company lost $2.7 million. In 1929 it merged with Maddux Air Lines and in 1930, during what was to become the Air Mail scandal, it merged with Western Air Express to form Transcontinental & Western Air (T&WA;). Western became an independent company once again in 1934. However, Transcontinental opted to retain the T&WA; name, and eventually evolved into Trans World Airlines or TWA. First air crash On September 3, 1929, a westbound TAT flight crashed on Mt. Taylor in New Mexico, with loss of all aboard. The Associated Press said it was the first plane crash on a regular commercial land route. The September crash was the first of three serious accidents for TAT over the next five months.

She was awarded the Military Medal for her work in France with the Canadian Army Service Corps and later joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. She died at the age of 105. Biography Sara \\"Sadie\\" Bonnell was born in Kew, Surrey, on 4 June 1888. She was educated at Bedales, a co-educational school. After leaving school she lived at home. During the First World War, she wanted to become an ambulance driver but was not allowed to do so by the authorities since she was a woman. Instead, she drove ambulances for the Canadian Army Service Corps. She later joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY) in December 1917 as driver of horse-drawn vehicles transporting field kitchens mobile showers and supply trucks. The FANYs had been founded in 1907 as an all-women mounted volunteer corps and shifted into ambulance work as casualties increased. Bonnell showed great courage during the East End Air Raid. She was driving an ambulance in 1916 during some of the first air raids London experienced. Bonnell earned the Military Medal on the night of 18‚Äì19 May, 1915, when she was based in a large camp on the road to Arques in France. She collected wounded men near from a dressing station near Saint-Omer whilst under heavy German bombardment for five hours. The enemy's shells had set a nearby ammunition dump on fire. She returned again and again with Evelyn Brown, a volunteer Canadian, succeeding in removing all the wounded. She was decorated by the commander of British Second Army, General Sir Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer. After the war, Bonnell returned to England in 1919 and worked in hospitals as a volunteer. She loved fast cars and between the wars drove a six-cylinder AC with a red fish mascot on the bonnet which echoed the FANY logo. Personal life and death Bonnell married Herbert Marriott on 1 September 1919. He was a poison gas victim and proposed to her whilst they were under enemy fire in France. He died in 1921 during the influenza pandemic. She later married again in 1948, to Charles Leslie Talbot, who died in 1967. She had no children herself and was devoted to her nieces and nephew. She spent the Second World War in Sussex and knew A. A. Milne and his son, Christopher Robin. In the 1920s, Bonnell designed and built a house called \\"Thrushling\\" in Upper Hartfield, Sussex. After she sold it she revisited it and reviled the owners for covering her beautiful parquet floor with a carpet. She spent her final years at Dorset House, Droitwich. At 95, she regretted that she could no longer drive fast cars. She received a telegram from the Queen on her hundredth birthday on 4 June 1988. She died at the age of 105 on 2 September 1993. Her obituary appeared in the Daily Telegraph, The Independent and The Times.

It was first established as an airfield in 1911, and in 1913, the Dutch Army bought the field and established the Army Aviation Division. For almost 40 years, United States Air Force facilities at Soesterberg, named Camp New Amsterdam was a major front line USAFE air base during the Cold War. The base was closed on 31 December 2008, due to budget cuts in the Dutch Army. The air base ceased flying operations on 12 November 2008, when the command was transferred from the Dutch Air Force to Dutch Defense who will take care of the base until it will be given back to nature. The last fighter ever to depart, delayed due bad weather at Aviano AB, was a Greek F-4E Phantom II. The former USAFE part stays in military hands, and will now officially be called Camp New Amsterdam. Early history During World War I, the Netherlands was a neutral country, and flew border patrol missions from Soesterberg airfield. The Dutch confiscated all foreign aircraft landing inside the borders of their country during the war, and added the operational ones to their inventory to be used for pilot training at Soesterberg. At the beginning of World War II, the Dutch again declared neutrality, but the German force's blitzkrieg overran the country in five days, and Soesterberg was occupied by the German Luftwaffe on 15 May 1940. A variety of German aircraft was stationed there during the war, flying anti-shipping missions along British convoy routes in the North Sea, bombing missions over England, and fighter defence against Allied bombing missions. Throughout the war, Allied Air Forces caused enormous damage to the airfield, and by September 1944 the Luftwaffe acknowledged Soesterberg airfield to be more or less useless. In May 1945, Canadian forces liberated the airfield. After the War, an extensive Dutch construction programme was started  to build, new hangars, extending the runways and several locations around the base, used as service areas during the War, were upgraded. On 5 August 1951, the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) declared it operational and gave it an air defence role. The RNLAF has maintained flying units at Soesterberg since then. On the base two monuments were erected. The monument for Fallen Aviators (Monument voor Gevallen Vliegers) is the official Royal Netherlands Air Force Memorial, and located near the main entrance of the base. On Memorial Day, May 4, the Royal Netherlands Air Force holds a ceremony to remember and commemorate the fallen of World War II. The other monument at the base is for Executed Resistance Fighters. It is the symbol for the sacrifice that 33 resistance fighters gave for freedom. Every year on 19 November, there is a memorial service. During World War II, the German Army (Wehrmacht) secretly executed the 33 resistance fighters in the woods of the base. The resistance fighters were part of several resistance groups and most of them were caught due to betrayal. Although the execution was held in secret, there were rumours about it, and after the War the base was minutely searched. The mass grave, camouflaged by buried trees, was located by Major A. Siedenburg. His son was one of the victims. United States use North American F-86F-25-NH Sabre, AF Ser. No. 52-5385. This aircraft is now on display at the Nationaal Militair Museum on the former Soesterberg Air Base, Netherlands. In 1954, the Dutch government agreed to the stationing of a US Air Force fighter squadron to augment air defence. The USAF forces operated from a part of Soesterberg Air Base which was named Camp New Amsterdam, in honour of the first Dutch settlement in America, Nieuw Amsterdam, later renamed New York City. 512th Fighter-Day Squadron The first U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) unit to operate from Soesterberg was the 512th Fighter-Day Squadron, which arrived with North American F-86F \\"Sabre\\" on 16 November 1954 from RAF Manston in the UK. By July 1955, the 512th reached full operational status. 32d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron In September 1955, the designation of the 512th was transferred to RAF Shepherds Grove, where it replaced the 78th FIS. Its aircraft, personnel and equipment however stayed in the Netherlands, and made up the newly activated 32d Fighter Day Squadron, which was operated at Soesterberg as a detachment of the 36th Fighter Wing at Bitburg Air Base in the Federal Republic of Germany. North American F-100C-20-NA Super Sabres of the 32d Tactical Fighter Squadron. Identifiable AF Serial Numbers are 54‚Äì1904, 54-1905 and 53-1771 Convair F-102A-55-CO Delta Daggers of the 32d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, AF Serial Numbers 56-1042 and 56‚Äì1043. In the 1980s, these aircraft were later modified to the PQM-102B configuration and used as target drones. McDonnell Douglas F-15C-24-MC Eagles of the 32d Tactical Fighter Group, AF Serial Numbers 79‚Äì0015, 0019, 0026 and 0027. When the 32d TFG was inactivated in 1994, these aircraft were sold to the Royal Saudi Air Force. McDonnell Douglas F-4E-61-MC Phantoms of the 32d Tactical Fighter Squadron, AF Serial Numbers 74-1046 and 74‚Äì1053. These aircraft served until the late 1980s in USAFE, TAC and AFRES before being retired to AMARC. In 1956, the squadron transitioned to the North American F-100 Super Sabre. The 32d sent five instructors pilots to Sidi Slimane AB in Morocco to complete transition training for the F-100. At the same time, the squadron began ferrying the F-86s to Prestwick, Scotland, and in France for disposal. On 18 July 1958, USAFE redesignated the unit as the 32d Tactical Fighter Squadron, as part of the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing. Due to the requirement of a longer runway for landing and take offs, the runway of the base was extended to over . In 1959, the 32d received the signature \\"Royal\\", the crown and wreath of the Dutch Royal Family (the House of Orange) were added to the emblem, giving it its unique look. This unique honour was granted in recognition of the unit's contribution to the defence of the Netherlands, and graphically illustrates the 32d's close ties with the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The 32 TFS had the unique distinction of being the only unit in the USAF whose emblem included the royal crest of another nation. This addition was only authorised as long as the 32d TFS remained in the Netherlands. From 1959, the 32d was redesignated as the 32d Fighter Interceptor Squadron and received Convair F-102 Delta Daggers. It acquired a 24-hour alert interceptor mission from Soesterberg as part of NATO‚Äôs Second Allied Tactical Air Force. The 32 FIS was assigned to the USAFE 86th Air Division (Defense) at Ramstein Air Base West Germany on 1 July 1960. This transfer was made in order that all USAF fighter assets in Europe could be concentrated in one command. 32nd Tactical Fighter Squadron As a result of the 1968 Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia, the USAF announced that its F-102 squadrons would be re- equipped with the modern McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. The 32nd FIS was first in line to undergo the conversion, and the F-102s were flown back to the United States and were transferred to the Air National Guard. On 1 July 1969, the USAF redesignated the unit as the 32nd Tactical Fighter Squadron (32nd TFS). On 6 August 1969, the first two, brand new, Phantoms arrived. Flying the F-4 Phantom meant some drastic changes for the squadron and the base. In 1989, the Dutch government was ordered to allow the USAF to change its headquarters unit at Soesterberg AB from squadron to group status. The 32d Tactical Fighter Group was activated at Soesterberg on 16 November 1989, with the 32nd Tactical Fighter Squadron as a subordinate unit with the exact same number of F-15s. Group aircrew and ground support personnel were deployed, for operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. On 28 January 1991, one crew destroyed an Iraqi MiG fighter aircraft. After the war they continued their air activities in theatre as a part of Operation Provide Comfort from April 1991 until April 1993. Dutch use On the Dutch side, the airfield was also used by various fighter units. The last Dutch fighter unit at this airfield was 325 Squadron flying the Hawker Hunter, which was inactivated in August 1968. In September 1968 three flying units came from Ypenburg Royal Netherlands Air Force Base to Soesterberg. These were 334 Squadron flying the venerable Fokker F.27, 298 Squadron flying the SA 316 and the SAR flight flying the SA 316. The SAR flight then transferred in 1977 to Leeuwarden Air Base. In August 1981 however, the 336 Squadron was reborn at Soesterberg. The task this time: Patrolling the skies over and around the islands of the Netherlands Antilles in the Caribbean. For the job, two new Fokker F.27 Mk.200 Maritime Patrol Aircraft were ordered. In September 1981, the first aircraft was delivered to the Royal Netherlands Air Force, and received the registration M-1. This aircraft departed to Cura√ßao in early November 1981, and the first pilot was Mayor G.W.G.F. Rijnders. The aircraft arrived on the island on 13 November 1981. The second Maritime registered M-2 arrived in March 1982. In 1992 334 Squadron moved to Eindhoven Airport. With this departure, 298 Squadron was the only flying unit at the base until 1995, when 300 Squadron joined 298 Squadron. In the same year, the 298 Squadron converted to the CH-47 Chinook, and passed the SA 316 to Gilze-Rijen Air Base, while 300 Squadron received the AS 532 U2 Cougar. Later the SA 316 returned to Soesterberg and joined 300 Squadron. USAF departure A former hangar of the air base used as a conference space, 2015 With the end of the Cold War, a major force draw-down occurred in Europe, with the USAF reducing its USAFE fighter force structure. These changes affected the 32nd and, as part of the draw-down, the squadron's F-15 Eagles returned to the United States. The original intent of USAFE was to inactivate the 32d Fighter Group and orders were so issued inactivating the group's subordinate units on 1 July 1994 and the group on 1 October. On 19 April, the group furled its colors in formal ceremonies attended by members of the Royal Family, and the American ambassador. On 1 July, HQ USAFE activated the 632d Air Base Squadron to replace the 32d Fighter Group at Soesterberg to complete closure actions. The same order redesignated the group's 32d Fighter Squadron as the 32d Air Operations Squadron, part of the 32d Air Operations Group. All actions were effective 1 July 1994. In this way, USAFE was able to preserve the lineage of these two distinguished units. The U.S. part of Soesterberg was returned to the Netherlands government on 27 September 1994. Only one USAF F-15A remains in the Netherlands, and is displayed at the Military Aviation Museum. Soesterberg then became a Royal Netherlands Air Force transport helicopter base with 298th squadron (CH-47 Chinook) and 300th squadron (AS 532 U2 Cougar and SA 316) stationed at the base. Flying officially ended on 12 November 2008. The last jet ever to take off was a Hellenic AF F-4E Phantom II. The base formally closed on 31 December 2008, with the 298th and 300th Squadrons of the Royal Netherlands Air Force moving to Gilze-Rijen Air Base. However, a part of the base remains in use as a glider field. The former USAFE side remains in use by Dutch military ground units and is called \\"Camp New Amsterdam\\". The Air Force museum returned to the base and will use most of the existing hangars.

G√∂ksu Pavilion, is a summer pavilion in Istanbul, Turkey, situated in the K√º√ß√ºksu neighborhood of Beykoz district on the Asian shore of the Bosphorus between Anadoluhisarƒ± and the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge. The pavilion was used by Ottoman sultans for short stays during country excursions and hunting.  History  The pavilion was commissioned by Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid I (1823‚Äì1861), and designed by the architects Garabet Amira Balyan and his son Nigoƒüayos Balyan in the neo-baroque style. Completed in 1857, the structure took the place of a two storey timber palace built during the reign of Mahmud I (1696‚Äì1754) by his Grand Vizier Divittar Mehmed Pasha, then successively used by Selim III (1761‚Äì1808) and Mahmud II (1785‚Äì1839). Entrance to the palace grounds from land The building consists of two main stories and a basement on a footprint of 15 x 27 m. Unlike other pavilion gardens with high walls; its garden is surrounded by cast iron railings with one gate at each of the four sides. The basement was appointed with kitchen, larder, and servant's quarters, with the floors above reflecting the design of a traditional Turkish house - four corner rooms surrounding a central hall. The rooms at the waterfront have two fireplaces while the others have one each, all fashioned from colorful Italian marble. The rooms boast crystal chandeliers from Bohemia, with curtains, furniture upholstery, and carpets woven in Hereke. The halls and the rooms exhibit paintings and arts objects; Charles S√©chan, stage designer at Vienna State Opera, was charged for the decoration of the interior. During the reign of Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz (1830‚Äì1876), more elaborate decoration was added to the fa√ßade; some of the original garden outbuildings were demolished at that time. In the beginning of the Republican era, the site was used as a state guesthouse for some years. Since a thorough restoration in 1944, the palace has been open to the public as a museum. The pavilion appeared in the James Bond film \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" as the mansion of oil heiress Elektra King in Baku. The pavilion also appeared in popular Bollywood film Ek Tha Tiger.

He was a with the St. George Dragons during their 11-year consecutive premiership winning run from 1956 to 1966. He was a representative for Australia and captained them in 10 Test matches from 1963 to 1966. Biography Born on 20 March 1933 in Bogan Gate near Parkes in western New South Wales, Walsh played in country sides at Parkes, Forbes and Eugowra. He was selected to represent the Western Division when they hosted the 1951 French touring side and lost. It was as a country representative that his international d√©but was against New Zealand in 1959, and later that year was selected for the 1959-60 Kangaroo tour. He played in all six Tests and in 17 minor tour matches. St. George Dragons Walsh joined St. George Dragons in 1962 and played ninety-six games till 1967, playing in four winning Grand Finals (1962, 1963, 1965 and 1966). His first Test as captain was on the 1963 Tour of Great Britain which saw the Kangaroos become the first Australian touring team in 50 years to win the Ashes. He was captain for the \\"Swinton Massacre\\" 2nd test of that tour when the Kangaroos registered the biggest win in Anglo-Australian test history, 50-12. After the retirement of Norm Provan in 1965, Walsh took on the role of St. George's captain-coach. In 1966 he achieved a rare distinction becoming the only player to captain-coach Australia to an Ashes series victory and his club to a premiership. He played a total of twenty-five tests for Australia from 1959 to 1966.Writer, p. 415 The Dragons' star players were growing old, the young and brutal South Sydney Rabbitohs were looming as title contenders and the inevitable end to the run had to be approaching.Writer, p. 413 Nevertheless, Walsh was able to lead the Dragons against the Balmain Tigers to their 11th straight victory and the end of their run. Post playing and accolades After retiring as a player Walsh coached the Parramatta Eels to the semi finals of the 1971 NSWRFL season before becoming a successful columnist with the Daily Telegraph for over 20 years and a Country and State selector. He worked in sales in the printing industry in Sydney. In February 2008, Walsh was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.

History The land upon which Madonna Church now stands was part of one of the first grants bordering the New Jersey Palisades. Given to Samuel Moore by British Army Major John Berry in 1726, this land remained in the Moore family's possession until 1829. As county records indicate, Jacob Riley purchased it and started construction on the chapel, which was subsequently completed by Henry James Anderson in 1854. A few years later, a rectory was erected at the rear of the church. Reverend John Joseph Hughes, the first Archbishop of New York, appointed Father A. Cauvin pastor of the Fort Lee Mission in 1851, a position which Father Cauvin held until 1859 when he delegated his work to an assistant, Reverend Annelli. This decade saw the Catholics from Hackensack and Lodi gather weekly at Fort Lee for Holy Mass and spiritual instruction. The most important individual in the young church's history was a layman, Henry James Anderson, whose remains lie beneath the church's floor with his wife and son. While seeing to the church's completion, Anderson, a convert to Catholicism, served as a surgeon and as professor of astronomy and mathematics at Columbia College in New York City. His energy and persistence won Madonna her first resident priest, Father Cauvin.

The band was formed in late 1993 by guitarist Johnny Stoj came to international notice in 1998 after being signed to Nuclear Blast records. The band has released five studio albums, the most recent being In Metal We Trust in 2011. While they have appeared at the Wacken Open Air festival and toured Europe twice, since around 2000 Pegazus has played only in Australia with multiple east coast shows. Biography Pegazus was formed in 1993 in Melbourne, Australia by guitarist Johnny Stoj with his brother Robbie on drums.\\"Pegazus,\\" Encyclopaedia Metallum. Web, 11 Sep. 2010. After cultivating a visual and musical style similar to bands like Judas Priest and Manowar, the band recorded a self- titled album in 1995 with Justin Fleming on vocals and Dave King on bass. The following year, Fleming was replaced by Danny Cecati and the band recorded a new demo and began seeking a record deal. Linking up with Melbourne‚Äôs Metal Warriors, the band‚Äôs second album Wings of Destiny was released locally in 1997. After receiving a copy of the album, Germany‚Äôs Nuclear Blast Records offered the band a contract and released Wings of Destiny worldwide with more distinctive, professional artwork. In August 1998, Pegazus travelled to Germany to perform at the Wacken Open Air festival. The show was remarkable not only as the first the band had ever played outside Melbourne but because they appeared at the festival twice, on the main stage and again on a side- stage later as a replacement for Darkseed. Following Wacken, the band returned to Australia briefly before going back to Europe in September to tour with HammerFall. Eric Martins played bass at all of these shows as King had left the band. Corey Betts joined Pegazus as King‚Äôs replacement in January 1999 and very little was heard from the group until the Breaking the Chains album was released late in the year. Controversy followed shortly after when it was revealed in March 2000 that Cecati had been fired for apparently devoting too much time to another Melbourne band called Anarion. Cecati countered by claiming that he had become frustrated with the virtual inactivity of Pegazus as a live act and Johnny Stoj‚Äôs creative control over the group. He subsequently also left Anarion and joined Eyefear in late 2000. In September 2000, Rob Thompson replaced Cecati. Pegazus then toured interstate in January 2001, playing their first shows outside of Melbourne since the European tour in September 1998. At approximately the same, Betts formed another band, Kymera, with ex-members of Cyclone Tracy and Catwitch, but would remain with Pegazus until after the recording of the next album. Kymera would later become Black Majesty. The Headless Horseman, released in 2002, was the first Pegazus album in three years and would prove to be its last for Nuclear Blast. Following Betts‚Äô departure, Black Majesty guitarist Hanny Mohammed became the band‚Äôs bass player for its infrequent live appearances. Robbie Stoj then left Pegazus in September 2003, with Bernie Goldstein temporarily filling the role, and the band recorded some performances for a live album. In the meantime, the group‚Äôs relationship with Nuclear Blast came to an end with Pegazus claiming the label had virtually ignored its previous release. The live album Live! ‚Äì Thunder Down Under was released independently by the band in February 2004. At around the same time, Robbie Stoj was finally replaced by Ange Sotiro and Betts by Joe Fata, who had ironically also replaced him briefly in Black Majesty. After several years of inactivity Pegazus returned to the live circuit in 2009, but not before Rob Thompson left for personal reasons and was replaced by original vocalist Justin Fleming.

It is one of the nine of those tribes making up the \\"Nine Tribes\\" First Nation of the lower Skeena River resident at Lax Kw'alaams (a.k.a. Port Simpson), British Columbia. The name Gitando means the people of weirs. Their traditional territory includes the watershed of the Exstew River, a tributary of the Skeena River. Since 1834, the Gitando have been based at Lax Kw'alaams, following establishment of a Hudson's Bay Company trading fort there. They are closely related to the Gispaxlo'ots, another of the Nine Tribes, who have an adjacent territory. History and government The Tsimshian have a matrilineal kinship system, with property and inheritance passed through the maternal line. The chieftainship of the Gitando resides with the hereditary name-title Sgagweet, the holder of which is chief of the House of Sgagweet, a Laxsgiik (Eagle clan) house-group (or extended matrilineal family). In 1938 American anthropologist Viola Garfield reported that the title name was derived from chief Paul Sgagweet, who died in 1887 and was commemorated by a 15-foot totem pole marble headstone representing one of his most prominent crests, the \\"Standing Feeding Beaver.\\" The totem pole still stands in the village of Lax Kw'alaams in the 21st century. Paul Sgagweet bequeathed the name to his first cousin or sister's son, Alfred Dudoward. Dudoward was instrumental in establishing a Methodist mission at Lax Kw'alaams. Dudoward had no (matrilineal) heirs and so adopted his own son and a niece into the house. The son inherited the name Sgagweet after Dudoward's death in 1914 or 1915. He was holding the chief's position and title when Garfield was writing in 1938. He had designated the niece's son as his successor. But this son, named Clarence Watson, moved to Southern British Columbia and accepted the Canadian franchise, which at the time required him to surrender his Native Status. After that, the chieftainship was held in trust by the sons of Alfred Dudoward. The youngest, Charles Dudoward (Chief Wiishakes), gave the responsibility to his first cousin's son, Libby Kelly. From Libby the names were passed to his nephews Mitch and Fred Dudoward. But, the name Sgagweet has never been assigned to anyone since Alfred Dudoward. Houses and clans In 1935 William Beynon recorded that Gitando people in Lax Kw'alaams included 14 members of the Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) (1 house-group), 17 members of the Ganhada (Raven) (1 house-group), and 25 members of the Laxsgiik (Eagle) (2 house- groups, including the House of Sgagweet, with 5 members). George Kelly was a member of the House of Sgagweet. He was adopted into the Gispaxlo'ots in order to perpetuate the House of Ligeex, a house closely related to Sgagweet. The anthropologist Marius Barbeau, in a survey of totem poles, described several poles belonging to various Gitando Laxsgiik houses which had stood in Lax Kw'alaams. One, a Sgagweet pole depicting a Standing Beaver, stood until at least 1947. In addition to the House of Sgagweet, other Gitando houses include: * Gilasgamgan‚ÄîLaxsgiik (Eagle clan) * Gistaaku‚ÄîLaxsgiik (Eagle) * Gamayaam‚ÄîGispwudwada (Killerwhale) * Niisx≈Çoo‚ÄîLaxsgiik (Eagle) * Niisyagayunaat‚ÄîGanhada (Raven) * 'Nluulax‚ÄîLaxsgiik (Eagle) There were ten houses in total in the early 20th century. But infectious disease epidemics and migration decimated the population of the Gitanndo and most tribes of the Tsimshian. In the early 21st century, some six families occupy four houses of the Gitando: i) House of Sgagweet ii) House of Gilasgamgan & Gistaaku iii)House of Geyshluk (from Gamayaam) iv) House of Niisyagayunaat Sources * Barbeau, Marius (1950) Totem Poles. 2 vols.

Port Simpson), B.C. The name Gitlaan means literally \\"people of the Stern Canoe.\\" Their traditional territory includes the watershed of the Zimacord River, a tributary of the Skeena River. An area of the riverbank there resembled from the distance a canoe-stern, hence the name of the tribe. (The Zimacord watershed is also claimed by the Kitsumkalum Tsimshians.) Since 1834, the Gitlaan have been based at Lax Kw'alaams, when a Hudson's Bay Company fort was established there. In 1887, the great majority of the Gitlaan tribe moved from Lax Kw'alaams and Metlakatla, B.C., with the Anglican lay minister William Duncan to found the new community of \\"New\\" Metlakatla, Alaska. However, a small Gitlaan contingent remained behind in B.C. In the absence, though, of surviving members in Lax Kw'alaams of the House of Gwiskyaan, the royal line that traditionally had provided successors to the chieftainship of the Gitlaan tribe, a Nisga'a family from a related Laxgibuu (Wolf clan) house-group (extended matrilineal family) moved to Lax Kw'alaams to become the new royal house of the Gitlaan (this occurring, then, some time between 1887 and 1913). This matriline included or came to include sons of the Gispaxlo'ots house- chief and Hudson's Bay Company employee Arthur Wellington Clah, including Albert Wellington, who served as chief of the Gitlaan with the name Gwisk'aayn until his death in 1913. Wellington's sister's son, William Beynon, who was to become the renowned ethnologist, moved from Victoria, B.C., to Lax Kw'alaams at that time to preside over Wellington's funerary rites and assume the title Gwisk'aayn and with it the chieftainship of the Gitlaan, in accordance with Tsimshian rules of matrilineal succession, though there was initial opposition based on the fact that Beynon had become \\"enfranchised\\" as a Canadian citizen (and was thus no longer, in the law's eyes, \\"Indian\\"). Beynon was chief of the Gitlaan until his death in 1958. The name Niis≈Çaganuus has since been restored to use in replacement of Gwiskyaan. Chief Niis≈Çaganuus was Henry Helin, then Henry's son Barry Helin (father of the author Calvin Helin), and presently Barry's nephew Randy Dudoward Sr. In 1935 William Beynon recorded that Gitlaan people in Lax Kw'alaams included 4 members of the Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan), 8 member of the Ganhada (Raven), and 9 members of the Laxgibuu (Wolf), each clan being represented by only one house-group.

Duffy is probably most remembered for being a part of what is considered a lopsided trade between the Reds and Giants. On May 29, 1971, Duffy was traded along with pitcher Vern Geishert for young outfielder George Foster. Geishert, who had played briefly in the majors in 1969, never played in the majors again, while Foster developed into a feared slugger and an important cog in \\"The Big Red Machine\\", the Reds' dynastic team of the first half of the 1970s. Later that same year, Duffy was part of a second trade that is almost as infamous. On November 29, exactly seven months after the previous trade, Duffy was traded with pitcher Gaylord Perry to the Indians, with the Giants receiving pitcher Sam McDowell. In this case, Duffy was on the other side of the lopsided deal, as he went on to be the Indians' starting shortstop for several years, leading the league in fielding percentage for shortstops in 1973, and placing in the top 5 for that same stat for his first 5 years in Cleveland.\\"Year-by-Year Top-Tens Leaders & Records for Fielding % as SS\\" Perry went on to win 20 games three times, receive two Cy Young Awards, and eventually earn a place in the Hall of Fame, while McDowell pitched for four seasons, winning 10 games in 1972 but only 9 in the next three seasons combined.

Silverman (May 19, 1873 ‚Äì September 23, 1933) was an American journalist and newspaper publisher. He was the founder of the weekly newspaper Variety in New York City in 1905, which gave theatre and vaudeville reviews and the Hollywood-based Daily Variety magazine in 1933, focusing on the emerging motion picture film industry Early life Silverman was born to an American Jewish family on May 19, 1873 in Cortland, New York. His father, Louis J. Silverman, was a businessman. Career Silverman began his career by working for his father. In 1903, he became a journalist for the Daily America and wrote under the pen name \\"The Man in the Third Row\\". After the Daily America dissolved, he later joined the New York-based The Morning Telegraph but was fired in 1905 for a notice on a new sketch played by Mrs. Stuart Robson at Proctor's 58th Street theatre where the review mentioned the sketch was n.g. (no good). He was not aware that Mrs. Robson had given the Telegraph an advertising contract for $50. Despite suggesting that since the sketch was n.g., that might make the contract n.g., too, as Mrs. Robson wouldn't advertise what she couldn't play, the owner did not like the suggestion. p. 8 Silverman decided that he would have to start his own paper in order to be able to tell the truth. With a loan of $1,500 from his father- in-law, Alderman George Freeman of Syracuse, he launched trade newspaper Variety as the publisher and editor. He passed the editorship to Abel Green in 1931 but remained as publisher until his death soon after launching the magazine Daily Variety. During the course of his career, Silverman was known as the \\"oracle of show business, the sworn foe of grammar, and the man who never let anyone pay a check.\\" p. 1 In 1934, he headed a list in Time magazine of the \\"ten modern Americans who have done most to keep American jargon alive\\". In 1920, Silverman purchased an old brownstone building at 154 West 46th Street in New York, which became the company's headquarters until its sale and demolition in 1988. In 1922, Silverman acquired the entertainment newspaper the New York Clipper. Personal life, death and legacy Silverman married Harriett Freeman in 1889.. They lived at The Langham at 135 Central Park West in Manhattan. Silverman suffered from a bronchial condition and had travelled to California for the past two winters before his death for health reasons. Silverman died on September 23, 1933 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles from a lung hemorrhage. He was 60 years old. His body was found by casting director Ben Piazza and the editor of Daily Variety, Arthur Ungar, who suffered a mild heart attack on finding the body. His funeral was held at Congregation Emanu-El of New York on September 28, 1933. His son Sidne Silverman, known as Sid or \\"Skigie\\", succeeded him as publisher of both publications. His grandson son, Syd, became the third publisher of Variety. Silverman was the subject of a biography by Dayton Stoddart in 1941.

It is a naturally circulating hormone in animals, including humans. It was studied as a potential weight-loss drug, but failed to show benefit in clinical trials. It was first reported in 1996 to cause a body fat loss effect in rats in the International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders. The animal research has all been conducted by the Nitrogen-Obesity Research Group of the University of Barcelona. The compound was found to potently induce body-fat loss while preserving protein stores in animals which is the ultimate goal of an anti-obesity agent as body protein loss is an undesired but inevitable (to some degree) side effect of fat loss via calorie restriction. Mechanism of action  Oleoyl-estrone functions by reducing energy-intake without prescribed dietary restriction (forced dietary restriction in addition to OE actually led to protein losses) while maintaining energy expenditure (which normally falls as part of the adaptations to calorie restriction). The partitioning effects of this hormone leads to adipose stores being the source of energy that makes up for the energy deficit rather than protein stores. Research The molecule has been widely studied in various strains of animals and shown to be effective in virtually all studies. A surprising result that came out of the animal studies was that OE treated animals maintained their fat loss after treatment was stopped. Weight loss maintenance is one of the most difficult aspects of obesity treatment and so this effect is promising. This led to the postulation that oleoyl-estrone can reduce the body's bodyfat setpoint which would allow the body to maintain a reduced bodyfat without experiencing a hormonal milieu that aims to regain the lost bodyfat by reducing energy expenditure and increasing energy intake. The research group discovered that oleoyl-estrone levels correlated with bodyfat stores except for obese organisms where there was less oleoyl-estrone circulating than would be predicted based on bodyfat levels. This led to the theory that administering oleoyl-estrone to bring plasma OE levels up to normal would signal to the body that there is an excess amount of bodyfat and therefore there would be a bodyfat loss. Recent research shows that corticosterone inhibits the fat mobilizing effects of oleoyl- estrone in female rats that had their adrenal glands removed. The research group set up a company called Oleoyl-Estrone Developments in 2001 which included as a founder Mari√† Alemany, one of the principal researches, who is also the holder of a 1998 U.S. patent () for fatty acid esters of estrone, including OE, in relation to fat loss. The group studied the effects of oral OE on Mari√† Alemany who was morbidly obese. It was shown for the first time to be effective at producing fat loss in a human and also a maintenance (and increase) of weight loss in two-month rest periods in between three-week dosing periods. This was achieved with no prescribed dietary restrictions. Clinical development OE was licensed to Manhattan Pharmaceuticals in 2002. An Investigational New Drug application was accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005 and a Phase I trial was conducted in Switzerland. The results showed OE to be safe and to lead to weight loss after just 7 days of dosing, and this weight loss was maintained for three further weeks after treatment had stopped. In June 2006, a Phase IIa trial of 100 patients began which included two 14-day dosing periods each followed by 28 days of no treatment which was designed to elucidate the best dosing methods and in particular the maintenance of weight loss that had been shown. This trial was originally a single-centre trial in Switzerland, but in November 2006 it was announced that the trial had been expanded to two additional clinical sites in the USA. An additional trial was commenced in October 2006 that is designed to investigate the efficacy of the drug in morbidly obese patients who had been designated as bariatric patient candidates. This trial which took place in the United States, recruited 24 patients and dosed OE for 30 days, without any break, followed by 30 days of evaluation after dosing completed. On July 10, 2007 Manhattan Pharmaceuticals announced that its phase 2a studies for oral oleoyl-estrone failed. The two studies demonstrated no clinically meaningful or statistically significant placebo adjusted weight loss.http://www.emaxhealth.com/95/13821.html See also * Lipoidal estradiol References Antiobesity drugs Estranes Estrogens ","title":"Oleoyl-estrone"},{"id":"6329578","text":"Gunnar Ryan Wiik (born September 23, 1981) is a Norwegian actor and entrepreneur. Wiik resides in Los Angeles, California. Biography Wiik was born on September 23, 1981 in the seaside town of Dr√∏bak, Norway. In the late summer of 2005, Wiik appeared as a contestant in a Norwegian talent search TV show, Filmstjerne (English translation: ‚ÄúMovie Star‚Äù), but was voted out by the judges after the first round. In 2007, Wiik appeared as Jason in the thriller Timber Falls. In September 2009, Wiik co-founded WR Entertainment with James F. Cardwell, Duane M. Eberlein, Alan E. Bell, Michael Joseph Smith, √òyvind Holm-Johnsen and Steinar Larsen. On May 9, 2011, Daily Variety announced that WR Entertainment (through its subsidiary WR Films Entertainment Group) had acquired the motion-picture rights to all 83 novels in the best- selling Morgan Kane series, which had sold more than 20 million books to date. In January 2016, Wiik announced that he intended to star as the lead role in the planned Morgan Kane films, but later failed his audition. On January 13, 2016, WR Entertainment became a publicly traded company on the Oslo Stock Exchange Merkur Market under the name WR Entertainment ASA. Two months later, a private placement took place. In December 2016, Wiik resigned from WR in response to a group of shareholders seeking his and Chairman James F. Cardwell's removal from the company. This process was later chronicled by WR investor Jan Henry L√∏ken in VG's documentary The Ballad of Morgan Kane. Wiik stated in a press release that he resigned because of \\"creative differences.\\" Cardwell was later voted out by the shareholders at an EGM. Litigation In March 2017, Wiik filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against WR's CEO, Tasmin Lucia-Khan. The suit, including allegations of defamation and sexual manipulation, made international headlines. Wiik claimed that Lucia- Khan spread rumors about Wiik offering prostitutes to investors. Lucia-Khan filed a series of motions to quash service and an anti-SLAPP motion against Wiik. In the anti-SLAPP, one of WR's largest investors, Jonny Martinsen, states in his testimony that he was offered sex with Wiik's assistant as a gift. In June 2017 WR Entertainment filed a suit against Wiik for multiple counts of fraud, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Wiik filed a cross-complaint with multiple claims of breach of contract and fraud. In July 2017, WR Entertainment obtained an injunction from Oslo District Court () to freeze 18.7 million shares of stock in Wiik's name, pending outcome of WR's fraud claim filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Wiik appealed Oslo District Court's decision at a two day oral hearing in August 2017, but lost his appeal. Wiik appealed for the second time to the Borgarting Court of Appeal (). On December 1, 2017, Wiik lost his appeal for the second time. The Borgarting Court of Appeal upheld the injunction where the 18.7 million shares would be frozen until Los Angeles County Superior Court had made their ruling. In December 2017, Ryan Wiik reported a WR shareholder to the police for reckless behavior due to him posting parodic and satiric photos of Wiik. In June 2018, Wiik's case against the WR shareholder was dismissed by the police. On February 13, 2018, it was announced that a settlement had been reached between Wiik, WR Entertainment, and WR's CEO Lucia-Khan, where the pending lawsuits between the parties would be dismissed, and that Wiik had agreed to return the disputed 18.7 million shares back to WR Entertainment.

(National Icon Collection 18, British Museum) The Feast of Orthodoxy (also knowns as the Sunday of Orthodoxy or the Triumph of Orthodoxy) is celebrated on the first Sunday of Great Lent (six Sundays before Pascha) in the liturgical calendar of the Eastern Orthodox Church and of the Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches. The Feast is kept in memory of the final defeat of iconoclasm and the restoration of the icons to the churches.Merriam- Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions by Merriam-Webster (Jan 2000) page 231 History Despite the teaching about icons defined at the Seventh Ecumenical Council in 787, the iconoclasts began to trouble the Church again. After the death of the last iconoclast emperor, Theophilos, his young son Michael III, with his mother the regent Theodora, and Patriarch Methodios, summoned the Synod of Constantinople in 843 to bring peace to the Church. At the end of the first session, all made a triumphal procession from the Church of Blachernae to Hagia Sophia, restoring the icons to the church. This occurred on 11 March, 843 (which that year was the first Sunday of Lent). The Synod decreed that a perpetual feast on the anniversary of that day should be observed each year on the First Sunday of Great Lent, and named the day, \\"the Sunday of Orthodoxy\\" (·º° ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫·Ω¥ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ΩàœÅŒ∏ŒøŒ¥ŒøŒæŒØŒ±œÇ). The name \\"Orthodoxy\\" has gradually affected the character of the feast. Originally commemorating only the defeat of iconoclasm, the commemoration has gradually come to be understood in a more general sense as opposition to all heterodoxy. In this way, though its first occasion is not forgotten, the feast has become one in honour of Orthodox Christianity in general. This is shown by its special service. Service Icon of the Virgin and Child with angels and Sts. George and Theodore Stratelates, c. 600, one of a very few icons to survive Iconoclasm (encaustic on panel. Saint Catherine's Monastery, Mount Sinai). After Orthros and before the Divine Liturgy, a procession is made with icons to some destined spot (often merely around the church). Meanwhile, a Canon, attributed to St. Theodore of Studium, is sung. Once the procession arrives at the place, the Synodikon (decree of the Synod of Constantinople) is proclaimed aloud by the deacon. This Synodikon begins with the memory of certain saints, confessors and heroes of the faith, to each of whose names the people cry out: \\"Eternal Memory!\\" three times. Then follows a long list of heretics of all kinds, to each of which the answer is: \\"Anathema\\" once or thrice. These heretics comprise all the major opponents of the Orthodox Faith, Arians, Nestorians, Monophysites, Monothelites, Iconoclasts, and so on. Then comes again \\"Eternal Memory\\" to certain pious emperors, from Constantine the Great on. There are inevitably differences between the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic lists, as well as minor differences between the Synodika of individual national churches. The Orthodox acclaim Photius, Michael Cerularius, other anti-Roman patriarchs and many emperors. They curse Pope Honorius among the Monothelites, the opponents of Hesychasm. The Synodicon used by Greek- Catholics tends to omit a large number of these names. The format used by the Russian Orthodox Church differs slightly from that used among the Greek Orthodox: during the monarchy, the Emperor and his family were acclaimed, and \\"Eternal Memory!\\" was proclaimed for each member of the Romanov Dynasty; all are cursed who deny the divine right of kings and all who \\"dare to stir up insurrection and rebellion against it\\". In the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia anathemas were added against modernism and ecumenism. In Greek Orthodox churches the Creed is normally recited by the cantors in the Divine Liturgy, but on the Sunday of Orthodoxy especially it is often recited by a lay member of the congregation who is a secular official; it is a prerogative offered to the head of State, if present, in continuation of the same privilege held by the Emperors. Liturgical texts The liturgical texts for the Canon, Synodicon etc., and the rubrics will be found in either Triodion, Orthodox or Greek-Catholic. The theme of the day is the victory of the True Faith over heresy. \\"This is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith\\" (). Also, the icons of the saints bear witness that man, \\"created in the image and likeness of God\\" (), becomes holy and godlike through the purification of himself as God's living image. The First Sunday of Great Lent originally commemorated the Prophets such as Moses, Aaron, and Samuel. The Liturgy's Prokeimenon and alleluia verses as well as the Epistle and Gospel readings appointed for the day continue to reflect this older usage. Theological significance The name of this Sunday reflects the great significance which icons possess for the Orthodox Church. They are not optional devotional extras, but an integral part of Orthodox faith and devotion. The debate involved important issues: the character of Christ's human nature, the Christian attitude towards matter, and the true meaning of Christian redemption. Icons are held by the Orthodox to be a necessary consequence of Christian faith in the Incarnation of the Word (), Jesus Christ. Icons are considered by Orthodox Christians to have a sacramental character, making present to the believer the person or event depicted on them. However, the Orthodox always make a clear doctrinal distinction between the veneration (proskynesis) paid to icons and the worship (latria) which is due to God alone.

They emerged as a political power during the Shunga period (). In the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta (), the Arjunayanas figure among the autonomous political communities bordering on the Gupta Empire who accepted the overlordship of Samudragupta.

According to Dr Buddha Prakash, the Arjunayanas are mentioned as Prajjunakas in Kautiliya's text Arthashastra which also places them in the northern division of India.VarAhamihira's Brhatsamhita, v 14.24ab-14.25ab.India as seen in the Brhat samhita of Varaha- Mihira, 1969, p 68, A. M. Shastri. Vincent Smith locates their republic in Alwar and Bharatpur states now in Rajasthan, a view which has been rejected by R. C. Majumdar. They are mentioned in the literary sources in Afghanistan from 4th century BCE and after Alexander's invasions in 3rd century they have been mentioned in Agra, Mathura and Southern Haryana region till 4th century CE where their coins have been found too. Origin The origin of the Arjunayanas is shrouded in obscurity. In terms of literary evidence, Arjunava is mentioned as geographical term in Ganapatha (IV.2.127 dhuma-aday-ah) in PƒÅ·πáini (c. 600 BCE to 400 BCE). In terms of excavated archaeological evidence, they make their first appearance in history sometime after the invasion of Alexander and were first attested by their coins belonging to 2nd or 1st century BCE. See: Ganapatha, 124, dhuma-aday-ah; A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ of PƒÅ·πáini, 1989, p 1294, Sumitra Mangesh Katre. Arjunavana is derived from Arjunava. Arjunayana is same as Arjunavana or Arjunavayana.See: Journal of Ancient Indian History, 1972, p 318; University of Calcutta. Dept. of Ancient Indian History and Culture; and: Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, 1989, p 211, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute - Indo-Aryan philology; Ancient Kuruk·π£etra: Studies in Historical & Cultural Geography, 1991, p 127, O. P. Bharadwaj.. Arjunavana is believed to be derived from Arjunava, a composite of Arjuna and nava (young, modern or descended from). Greek sources Greek chronicler Arrian attests one city which he calls Arigaeum or Arigaeon/Arigaion which commanded the road between Kunar and Panjkora valleysOPERATIONS AGAINST THE ASPASIANS, Arrian Anabasis Book 4b, ChXXIV. in north-eastern Afghanistan. It was in the Kamboja region and the habitat of the Aspasioi tribe (A≈õvakas) whom Arrian calls Indian barbarians. These people had given a tough fight to Alexander in 327 BCE and when the defense of their citadel became difficult in view of the superior forces of Alexander, the inhabitants of Arigaeum/Arigaion had deserted the city, set it on fire and retreated to mountainous fastnesses. Alexander took his forces towards the mountainous fastness where most of the Arigaionians (inhabitants of Arigaion) were collected. A hard contest ensued with the Arigaionian Aspasians, both from the difficult nature of the ground and because the Aspasian Indians were not like the other barbarians of this district but were far stronger than their neighbors.OPERATIONS AGAINST THE ASPASIANS, Arrian Anabasis Book 4b, Ch XXIV, translated by E.J. Chinnock (1893). Ptolemy attests that Macedonian forces captured about 40,000, and that over 23,000 of which Alexander picked out the finest and sent them into Macedonia. Scholars like Dr V. S. Agarwala have equated the Arigaeum or Arigaion of Arrian to Sanskrit name Arjunava which finds mention in PƒÅ·πáini's Ganapatha A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ of PƒÅ·πáini, 1989, p 1294, Sumitra Mangesh Katre. as well as in the Kasika.Rijunavam nivaso desah (Kasika IV.2.69); India as known to PƒÅ·πáini: a study of the cultural material in the Ash·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´, 1963, p 457, Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala - Foreign Language Study. If this interpretation of scholars like Dr V. S. Agarwala is correct and the \\"Arjunava\\" of the Kashika or PƒÅ·πáini's Ganapatha is indeed the \\"Arigaeum/Arigaion\\" of Arrian, then the probable origin of the Arjunayanas can possibly be speculated. The section of Aspasian people inhabiting the city of Arigaion (Arjunava) were probably known as Arjunavanas, Arjunavayanas or Arjunayanas (from Arjunava). Indian sources A variant of Sanskrit Arjunayana is attested as Arjunayanaka. Kautiliya's Arthashastra (c. 200 BCE to 300 CE) mentions and brackets a nation called Prajjunaka with Gandhara :KAZ03.18.08/ tena zruta.upavaado vaag.jiivanaanaaM, kaaru.kuziilavaanaaM vRtty.upavaadaH, praajjuuNaka.gaandhaara.aadiinaaM ca jana.pada.upavaadaa vyaakhyaataaH (Arthashastra 03-18-08). and refers to their buffoons, Artisans and professional singers and actors. Since Gandhara was a great ancient cultural center, therefore, the Prajjunakas who are bracketed with the Gandharas and are attested to have Gandhara-like cultural characteristics, must also have laid close to Gandhara. The Prajjunakas of Arthashastra have been supposed by some scholars to be a variant of Sanskrit Arjunayanakas (Arjunayana).Political and Social Movements in Ancient Punjab, 1964, p 93, Buddha Prakash.Kautiliya's Arthashastra, 1997, p 247, R. P. Kangle. If this be correct, then the 4th-century BCE text on statecraft also attests the Arjunayanas (Arjunavanas) as close neighbors of the Gandharas which fact possibly alludes to the inhabitants of Arigaion (Arjunava) of the Swat/Kunar valleys. Dispersal and migration of the Arigaionians It is conceivable to infer that after suffering serious defeat at the hands of Alexander's Macedonian forces in 326 BCE, a section from the Arigaionians had left their old habitat between Swat and Kunar valleys, crossed the Punjab rivers and moved to Punjab and beyond to avoid further persecution by Alexander. 3rd century Buddhist tantra text Mahamayuri attests one place name Arjunavana which is presided over by Yaksha Arjuna. The same text also says that Duryodhana was the tutelary Yaksha of Srughana (modern Sugh in Yamunanagar). On the basis of the Mahamayuri, it has been speculated that the place name Arjunavana of the Buddhist text may have been somewhere near to Srughana (Yamunanagar in Haryana). It has been located somewhere within the triangle formed by Delhi-Jaipur and Agra regions.Journal of the Oriental Institute, 1970, p 433, Oriental Institute (Vadodara, India)A tribal history of ancient India, 1974, pp 18-19, Kalyan Kumar Dasgupta; Journal of the Oriental Institute, 1970, p 433, Oriental Institute (Vadodara, India). It is possible that the splinter group from the Arigaion (Arjunava) had moved to and settled in south-east Punjab and Rajasthan under pressure from Alexander and they probably named the political headquarters of their new-found territory also as Arjunavana (from Arjunava) which name finds reference in the 4th century CE Buddhist tantra text Mahamayuri. Arjunayanas of the coins have been identified by Fleet with the Kalachuris who traces their descent from Kartavirya Arjuna of the Haihaya tribe of the antiquity. Some other scholars like Dr Buddha Prakash however like to connect Arjunayanas to Pandava-hero Arjuna. Coins of Arjunayanas The findspot of Arjunayana coins indicates that their territory lay within the triangle formed by Delhi-Jaipur-Agra.Brhat Samhita of Varahamihira, 1996, p 180, VarƒÅhamihira, M.R. Bhat. The Arjunayana coins resemble those of the Yaudheya coins which show their contemporariness. They are several varieties. In one type, the obverse shows a bull and a standing goddess on the reverse. On another type, bull is standing before a tree in railing on the obverse and another bull facing a linga symbol and also carrying a legend Arjunayanajaya on the reverse. The third variety has a bull in the obverse and a swastika with taurine symbol at the end of arms and a branch or palm leaf and the legend Janayana on the reverse. These coins show that these people were devotees of the god Shiva. Now Shiva was the god of the North and also of the Ashvaka land as is attested by Greek chroniclers.The Indian Historical Quarterly, Vol 23-24, 1947-48, pp 290/291, N. Chaudhuri- India.Indian [mythology], 1917, p 110, Arthur Berriedale Keith, Albert Joseph Carnoy - Mythology, Hindu.Cf: \\"There were Dionysiac festivals in honor of god Siva who belonged to Asvaka district, north of Kabul river where flourished the vine-orchards\\" (See: Coins and Icons, A Study of Myth and Symbols in Indian Numistmatic Art, 1977, p 128, Bhaskar Chattopadhya) With the interpretation of Arrian's Arigaum/Arigaion with Sanskrit Arjunava as suggested by scholars, the possible origin and descent of Arjunayanas can possibly be traced to this Arigaion (Arjunava) of Swat/Kunar regions and possibly be connected with the Ashvakas of the Indian texts. Like Arjunayanas, the Ashvakas (Aspasioi and Assakenoi) were also a republican people as has been attested by Greek chroniclers.Alexander the Great, 2003, p 324, Dr W. W. Tarn. Also see p 45. The Ashvakas are believed to be a section of the ancient Kambojas. They are mentioned as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayas by PƒÅ·πáini.Ashtadhyayi Sutra IV.1.110; Ganapatha, Nadadigana IV.1.99. That the Arjunayanas were devotees of god Shiva also alludes to their possible connections with the Swat/Kunar valley, the land of the Ashvakas. Arjunayanas and Arjuna 2nd-century coin evidence attests that the Arjunayanas and Yaudheyas were neighbourly tribes and had collaborated in their joint fight against the foreign invaders like the Yavanas, Sakas, Pahlavas and later the Kushanas. Thus, some people speculate that Arujayanas and Yaudheyas may have been allied or related tribes. The Adiparva of Mahabharata references Yaudheya as the son of the Pandava, Yudhishthira.:Yudhishthiras.tu.go.vaasanasya.zaibyasya.devikaam.naama.kanyaam.svayam.vare.lebhe. :tasyaam.putram.janayaam.aasa.yaudheyam.naama. ::(Critical Edition: Mahabharata 1.90.83). Based on these references, these scholars have speculated that Yaudheyas had descended from, Yaudheya, son of Yudhishtra. And similarly, it has also been speculated that Arjunayanas had also probably descended from Pandava hero, Arjuna. This view is purely mythical and anachronistic. The Yaudheyas as a full-fledged tribe had participated in the Kurukshetra war on the side of Kauravas,Critical Edition: Mahabharata 7.180.16; Mahabharata 7.132.25; Mahabharata 7.136.05; Mahabharata 8.40.46. the enemies of Pandavas. Furthermore, prior to Kurukshetra war, the Yaudheyas, together with other Punjabi tribes like the Sibis, Trigartas, Rajanyas, Madras, Kekayas, Ambasthas, Kaukuras etc., had joined the Rajasuya ceremony of the Pandavas and had brought tributes to Yudhishtra. :Sibi.tri.garta.yaudheyaa.raajanyaa.madra.kekayaah. :AmbaSThaah.kaukuraas.taarkSyaa.vastrapaah.pahlavaih.saha ::(Critical Edition: Mahabharata 2.48.13-14). Thus, the claim that Yaudheyas had descended from Yaudheya, son of Pandava Yudhishtra is utterly baseless. Similarly, there is no basis, whatsoever, in the speculation that Arjunayanas may have descended from the Pandava hero Arjuna. These seem to be merely fantastic myths invented at later time to connect the Yaudheyas as well as the Arjunayanas to the heroic Pandava lineage. The Arjunayanas are not mentioned in the Mahabharata, Ramayana or any Vedic texts. While Yaudheyas are mentioned in the list of Ayudhajivi Samghas of PƒÅ·πáini,Ashtadhyayi V.3.114.. the Arjunayanas don't find any reference as such. It may also be a mere speculation that the Prajjunakas of Kautiliya's Arthashastra Arthashastra 3.18.08. are same as Arjunayanas (or Arjunayanakas).Allahabad Pillar Inscription mentions both Arjunayanas as well as Prarjunas as the two distinct people. If the Prajjunakas of Kautiliya's Arthashastra are equivalent to Sanskrit Arjunayanas, then it probably follows that by the time Samudragupta (c. AD 335 ‚Äì 380), there were known two branches of the Argaionians (Arjunavanas/Arjunayanas)----viz. the southern branch settled in south-east Punjab/Rajasthan came to be known as Arjunayanas while the original branch of the same people came to be known as Prarjunas i.e Pra-arjunas = Prajjunas (from Prakritic form Prarjjunakas as mentioned in Arthashastra ( 3.18.08), which may mean the furthest Arjunavanas. Thus, the Arjunayanas/Arjunavanas or Arjunayanakas are, in all probability, a post-Alexandrian phenomena and it is highly likely that this people had been fugitives from the Arigaion (Arjunava) region of the Kunar/Swat valleys. Arjunayanas in Allahabad Pillar Inscription The territory of the Arjunayanas bordered on the Gupta empire. They are recorded in the Allahabad Pillar inscription of Samudragupta () and are mentioned together with Malavas, Yaudheyas, Madrakas, Abhiras, Prarjunas, Sanakanikas, Kakas, Kharaparikas and other tribes.A History of Civilization in Ancient India, p 64-65, R. C. Dutt.India's diplomatic relations with the East, 1960, p 105, Bhasker Anand Saletore. They are believed to have been vanquished by Samudragupta, around 335 CE and amalgamated into the Gupta empire.

Under the direction of North High French/Radio teacher, the late Jerrold Molepske, some local and state personalities had their starts on the air of WSHS, like current Milwaukee radio host WTMJ Radio (620)'s Gene Mueller and Dick Alpert, the current traffic reporter and director for iHeartMedia's Madison and Milwaukee radio clusters, and for television partner WITI (Channel 6) in Milwaukee. Locally, WHBL/WHBZ (1330/106.5))'s Josh Dekker had his start during \\"South Nights\\" in the mid-1990s. During the school year, the station runs a music format from 8am-6pm CST, which is run by broadcasting students at North with a variety of genres played, including Top 40, soft rock, alternative music, and some hard rock. As the station is also an educational tool for the students, WSHS also runs news briefs, weather forecasts and fact segments (such as trivia questions, \\"Today in History\\", and \\"Birthdays\\") at various times throughout the day, along with taking requests via the phone and an in- studio fax machine (NPR News is also broadcast at the top of every hour in student-operated hours). All of the station's DJs are required to take two semesters of broadcasting classes, go through an application process, and be selected by the station manager before they can have an on-air shift on the station (requirements have been adjusted over the years; before the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a non-commercial FCC license was required for a student to take to the airwaves). Formerly the station broadcast both North and South high school athletics play-by-play with student commentary, though this role has been ceded in recent years to the SASD TV cable channel, along with WHBL's occasional broadcasts of athletic events. Programming After school hours, the station serves as the Sheboygan affiliate of the Ideas Network of Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR), which has a talk format, and acts mainly as a repeater of the schedule for WPR's Green Bay station, WHID (88.1). This was begun in the fall of 2000 to provide full-time programming for the station, as local translators for religious broadcasters began to fill the lower band of Sheboygan's radio dial, making reception of the Ideas Network's Milwaukee area affiliate, WHAD (90.7) (based in Delafield, a further location than the common tower farm on Milwaukee's east side) near impossible except for car radio reception. Family Radio's station WMWK, also on 88.1, from Milwaukee, makes most reception of WHID in the area impossible, though WSHS uses a mix of a satellite feed and tower reception of WHID with WMWK's transmission filtered out depending on conditions to translate the station. The full-time schedule also made any attempt for a religious organization to challenge a license renewal and claim the frequency from the Sheboygan Area School District due to lack of service unlikely, a strategy attempted with WEPS in Elgin, Illinois, which has also since used WPR Ideas Network programming to fill non-school hours. With WYVM, a new station which repeats the programming of Suring's WRVM coming to the air north of Sheboygan on 90.9 on December 3, 2012, WHAD has lost nearly all its Sheboygan reception, leaving WSHS and the network's web stream the only way to listen to Ideas Network programming in the area. The Ideas Network also runs almost all day on weekends and throughout the summer break, along with any school holidays. Since the fall of 2009 WPR hours have been extended during the school year due to budget constraints, and WPR programming currently starts at 4pm on most weekdays, with a 2pm start on Wednesdays due to that day's early dismissal schedule, and 1pm on most Fridays in order to accommodate the WPR broadcast of NPR's Science Friday, though WSHS may air unexpected music programming via pre-racked music at times if station staff do not transition to the Ideas Network feed at local sign-off. Locally-based programming is not streamed online, though WSHS's station identification reminds listeners that the full Ideas Network schedule is available through WPR's website and smart speakers during student/leased hours. During the latter part of the week, ethnic broadcasters air their programming on the station. A Hmong language talk/music program to serve the local Hmong population locally originated from the local Hmong Mutual Assistance Association since 1983 and hosted by Vue Yang airs on Thursdays after 4:30 pm,, while a local Spanish program consisting of mostly music airs on Friday or Saturday mornings. The locally originated ethnic programs broker their time from the school district to carry their programming. Previous history of calls in Floral Park, NY From 1950 to approximately the early 60s, the calls of WSHS were used by the high school radio station of Floral Park, New York's Sewanhaka High School, just east of Queens on Long Island. The station broadcast at 90.3 FM. Serving New York and Nassau County, it aired NAEB (National Association of Educational Broadcasters) produced and tape recorded educational programs directed to mostly elementary schools in the surrounding area with high school students as staff and the English department supervising the on-air staff of announcing and programming personnel most of whom were trained in special classes designed for that purpose. The technical staff were students from the V0-Tech department's electronics classes supervised by a professional broadcast engineer. Broadcast hours were limited to a few hours morning afternoon during school hours. From 5 to 7 PM the high school students provided original live programming which included public service programs serving the community and music. The station also broadcast Sewanhaka Chieftains football games and other sports. Several of the students went on to professional careers in broadcasting after graduation from high school and/or college. The 90.3 frequency today is utilized by WKRB in Brooklyn.

NAA is the second-most-concentrated molecule in the brain after the amino acid glutamate. It is detected in the adult brain in neurons, oligodendrocytes and myelin and is synthesized in the mitochondria from the amino acid aspartic acid and acetyl-coenzyme A.  Function  The various functions served by NAA are under investigation, but the primary proposed functions include: * Neuronal osmolyte that is involved in fluid balance in the brain * Source of acetate for lipid and myelin synthesis in oligodendrocytes, the glial cells that myelinate neuronal axons * Precursor for the synthesis of the neuronal dipeptide N-Acetylaspartylglutamate * Contributor to energy production from the amino acid glutamate in neuronal mitochondria In the brain, NAA was thought to be present predominantly in neuronal cell bodies, where it acts as a neuronal marker, but it is also free to diffuse throughout neuronal fibers.  Applications  However, the recent discovery of a higher concentration of NAA in myelin and oligodendrocytes than in neurons raises questions about the validity of the use of NAA as a neuronal marker. NAA gives off the largest signal in magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the human brain. The levels measured there are decreased in numerous neuropathological conditions ranging from brain injury to stroke to Alzheimer's disease. This fact makes NAA a potential diagnostic molecule for doctors treating patients with brain damage or disease. NAA may be a marker of creativity. High NAA levels in the hippocampus are related to better working memory performance in humans. NAA may function as a neurotransmitter in the brain by acting on metabotropic glutamate receptors.

Vilmar, 1868 August Friedrich Christian Vilmar, German Neo- Lutheran theologian; born at Solz (near Rotenburg, 78 m. NE of Frankfurt) November 21, 1800; died at Marburg July 30, 1868. Early career In 1818-20 he studied theology at Marburg, only to learn doubt from rationalism, and from doubt to pass to unbelief. In December, 1823, he was appointed rector of the municipal school at Rotenburg, where he remained until 1827, when he went to Hersfeld as fourth teacher and collaborator at the gymnasium, being promoted third teacher in 1829. During these years he renounced rationalism, and for a year or two professed the opinion that the world is the feeling of God. He made further progress through reading first the Church Fathers, especially Tertullian and Irenaeus, and then Tholuck's Lehre von der S√ºnde, and arrived at unwavering faith in Christ by his fortieth year, realizing that all he sought was to be found in the Lutheran Church, a process begun by the careful study of the Augsburg Confession and its Apology. In government In 1831 Vilmar was elected from Hersfeld to the newly created diet of the electorate of Hesse, and in December of the same year he was, appointed a member of the ministerial committees for religion and instruction. From Oct., 1832, to the end of Apr., 1833, he was assistant reporter in the ministry of the interior and nominal second teacher at the gymnasium of Hanau. He was director of the gymnasium at Marburg, 1833‚Äì50, being a member of the committee on gymnasia) affairs 1836-50; in 1850 he was transferred to the ministry of the interior as consistorial councillor, and from 1851 to 1855 also discharged the duties of the aged superintendent Ernst; in 1855 he became professor of theology at the University of Marburg. In the reports drawn up by Vilmar in the name of his committees for the Hessian Diet in 1831-32 he appealed effectually for the elevation of the national university, for the foundation of new professorships, and for the better equipment of institutions of learning. He also transformed the condition of the public schools, and may truly be termed the reformer of the gymnasia of Hesse. His views on gymnasia) instruction are set forth in his twenty-four Schulreden √ºber Fragen der Zeit (Marburg, 1846). During this period he published works dealing with Germanic linguistics, among them being: * Deutsche Altert√ºmer in Heliand (1845). * Vorlesungen √ºber die Geschichte der deutschen National-Literatur (1845). * Geschichte der deutschen National-Literatur (Marburg, 1846). * Handb√ºchlein f√ºr Freunde des deutschen Volksliedes (1866). * Ueber Goethes Tasso (Frankfort, 1869). * Lebensbilder deutscher Dichter (edited by Karl Wilhelm Piderit, Marburg, 1869). * Luther, Melanchthon, Zwingli (Frankfort, 1869). He also worked on the reformation of religious instruction in the gymnasia. Deeming that the gymnasium was designed to train up Christian leaders of the nation, and that religious instruction should assume a distinctively churchly character, Vilmar set forth his views in a series of contributions to Hengstenberg's Evangelische Kirchenzeitung in 1841 (ed. J. Haussleiter, under the title Ueber den evangelischen Religionsunterricht in den Gymnasien, Marburg, 1888). He also prepared for use in the gymnasia a Kleines evangelisches Gesangbuch (Marburg, 1838); taking part also in the struggle on behalf of the old hymnals, as well as in the preparation of the Deutsches evangelisches Kirchengesangbuch (Stuttgart, 1855). The Church, Vilmar believed, was about to enter upon a new era, when there would be foil recognition of the absolute unity of the visible and the invisible church, and of the communion of saints with one body on earth, foreshadowing the church of the Apocalypse, the New Jerusalem. With such a conviction, Vilmar found before him two tasks: The first of these concerned the creed of the church of Hesse, Vilmar maintaining that its future depended on its absolute fidelity to the confessions of the Church from the Apostles' Creed to the unaltered Augsburg Confession. To prove that the creed of the so- called Reformed church of Lower Hesse was this unaltered Augsburg Confession cost Vilmar immense toil. The second task was Vilmar's decided advocacy of the freedom of the Church from the State. In 1839 Vilmar took part in the Hessian confessional controversy, in which the attempt was made to discard the Augsburg Confession. Against such an endeavor Vilmar wrote his Verh√§ltnis der evangelischen Kirche in Kurhessen zu ihren neuesten Gegnern (Marburg, 1839). In like spirit, after the faculty of Marburg had required the use of the Heidelberg Catechism in the schools and had designated the doctrines set forth in the Hessian Catechism as \\"Reformed\\" (1855), Vilmar sought to prove, especially in his Geschichte des Konfessionsstandes der evangelischen Kirche in Hessen (Marburg, 1860), that the church of Lower Hesse was termed \\"Reformed\\" not because of the doctrines prevailing in it, but because of the form of worship introduced by the Landgrave Maurice in the Verbesserungspunkte in 1605, although after the middle of the seventeenth century the theology of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) had adopted the strict predestination of the Reformed. In Die Gegenwart und die Zukunft der niederhessischen Kirche (1867), he urged that the struggle against impending union be begun with the strongest emphasis on Lutheranism; and the failure to follow this counsel of Vilmar proved a fatal error in the conflict between the Hessian churches. In 1848-50 Vilmar exercised a profound influence on political affairs. Essentially a conservative and devoted to his sovereign, he not only supported his elector manfully, but also made the Hessischer Volksfreund, which he founded in 1848 and edited alone until the middle of 1851, a center for all the loyalists of the land. A number of his contributions to this periodical were reprinted by Vilmar himself under the title Zur neuesten Kulturgeschichte Deutschlands (3 parts, Frankfort, 1858-6?). Vilmar has rightly been characterized as preeminently acquainted with his native land and as a fervent admirer and protector of the relics of her past. His researches into Hessian history are embodied in his Hessisches Historienb√ºchlein (1842) and Hessische Chronik (1855), and he was also the author of the admirable Idiotikon von Kurhessen (1868). But dearer to him than all else was his church, of which he was acting superintendent, as already noted, from 1851 to 1855. His power as a preacher may still be seen in his Predigten and geistliche Reden (1876), while his visitation of churches in the discharge of his duties gave rise to many official communications of importance. Professor of theology at Marburg On the death of Superintendent Ernst, Vilmar was elected his successor. The election was subject, however, to the approval of the sovereign, and this the last prince-elector of Hesse refused. Vilmar, though elected superintendent, was now appointed professor of theology at Marburg (Oct. 27, 1855). Unwillingly he entered upon an office which he would have welcomed a quarter of a century before. Yet he became the most influential professor in the university. His program was set forth in Die Theologie der Thatsachen wider die Theologie der Rhetorik (1856), and four times, in the spirit of practical religion there propounded, he conducted his theological pupils through a three-years¬¥ course which covered the entire Bible. This course of lectures was edited by his pupil C. M√ºller under the title Collegium Biblicum (6 vols., G√ºtersloh, 1879‚Äì83); and most of his other lectures were also edited posthumously: K. W. Piderit preparing the Die Augsburgische Konfession (Marburg, 1870), Lehre vom geistlichen Amt (1870), Christliche Kirchenzucht (1872), Pastoraltheologie (G√ºtersloh, 1872), and Dogmatik (2 vols., 1874), and C. C. Israel those on Theologische Moral (2 vols., 1871). Vilmar lectured also on homiletics, hymnology, and the literary history of the theology of the Reformation period. Besides his professorial activity, Vilmar was the soul of the conferences of the Lutheran pastors of both Hesses, which were held alternately at Marburg and Friedberg from 1857 to 1866. He further aided the aims of these conferences by editing the Pastoraltheologische Bl√§tter (12 vols., Stuttgart, 1861‚Äì66), to which he contributed a series of articles edited by C. M√ºller under the title Kirche und Welt (2 vols., G√ºtersloh, 1872). Death But despite the companionship of his pupils, Vilmar felt more and more isolated and alone at Marburg, nor could he overcome his grief at the events of 1866. His melancholy continually increased, and a few months after the death of his second wife, he was found dead in bed from a repeated stroke of apoplexy.

It opened in 1990 in the new Transylvania area (now renamed \\"Wild Woods\\") and is the only Arrow Dynamics suspended roller coaster still operating outside of North America. The trains hang from the track, and swing freely as the roller coaster completes the course. It has two lift hills, featuring many dives and turns throughout, and takes place almost entirely through a forest. The ride layout was designed by John Wardley and the theme design by British firm Sparks Creative Services. The Vampire underwent modifications in 2001 so that it could use new trains manufactured by Vekoma and reopened in 2002. History=Theme The ride has a Gothic theme and was originally very detailed, with a queueline through castle gates, a fog-filled underpass beneath the coaster track, a graveyard canopy with Gothic tombs and dark passageway into the station. The station was dressed as a castle ballroom with flaming chandeliers, Gothic murals and a large pipe organ stage piece, with dramatic lighting and audio. However most of this has since been removed. The famous theme music in the station was composed by Graham Smart in the style of an organ overture with a Gothic rock sound, alluding to Phantom of the Opera. The station features an animatronic organist playing at a large pipe organ. The character originally moved in time to the soundtrack, appearing to play to the music. In 2015 the graveyard canopy was demolished following years of little maintenance. The grand station chandeliers were also removed. Now, very little of the themed queue and station exists the way it was intended, with much of the scenery, sound and lighting design lost. The rollercoaster originally had black, bat-themed trains. Towards the end of the ride, the coaster takes a sudden drop into a tunnel, before entering the brake run. The tunnel was originally longer, darker and themed as a cave, but this has been removed. In 1998, the ride was partly refurbished with new branding. Floorless refurbishment As Vampire started to show its age, it suffered from a number of breakdowns and maintenance problems. The manufacturer, Arrow Dynamics, had gone bankrupt since the ride had been built, meaning little could be done to rectify these issues. The Vampire was closed for the 2001 season, and at the time this was thought to be permanent. However, instead of removal, the decision was taken to modify the ride so that it could use a new type of suspended coaster train. The track was to remain unchanged because modifying this would require planning permission, which was unlikely to be granted. Since the ride consisted of the suspended swinging model, with tight corners, any new trains would also have to be able to swing (reducing lateral Gs). This led to the development of swinging suspended floorless coaster trains, manufactured by Vekoma, which are still in use today. The modified ride opened in 2002.

It was planned to run on a north- south route from Camden Town in the north, via King's Cross, to Peckham and Brixton in the south. The Cross River Tram scheme was proposed to relieve overcrowding on the London Underground and was due to begin operation by 2016. The project was cancelled by then mayor of London Boris Johnson in 2008 due to funding problems. A 2016 review of the CRT plan by subsequent mayor Sadiq Khan concluded that the CRT project would not be reopened at that time. London SE1 Community Website ‚Äì 29 May 2008 Overview The tram was planned to relieve overcrowding on the London Underground, and to improve transport in areas currently without good public transport, such as the Aylesbury Estate in Southwark, to support regeneration. Trams would have run up to every 4 minutes on each branch, giving a 2-minute service through central London at peak times. Despite following the same route, it was not envisaged that the Cross River Tram line would use the former Kingsway tramway subway. Cancellation On 18 July 2007, Mayor of London Ken Livingstone told the London AssemblyWebcast 18 July 2007 Mayor of London that he had asked TfL to consider splitting the implementation by building the southern section in advance of the northern section; it was not, however, clear where such a split would be. In May 2008, Livingstone's successor as mayor, Boris Johnson, announced that he intended to review the project in light of the lack of central government funding for the planned route.Cross River Tram under review says Boris Johnson London SE1 Community Website ‚Äì 29 May 2008 On 6 November 2008, Transport for London announced that the Cross River Tram would not be built. In a statement, it said: \\"Given the lack of funding available to implement the project and the likelihood of not securing additional third party funding, TfL is not in a position to develop the scheme any further.\\"Mayour outlines 10-year plan for massive transport expansion Transport for London 6 November 2008 The ¬£1.3bn project was cancelled in 2008 as art of a move to save ¬£2.4bn of transport- related funds.

In June 2016, Caroline Russell, a Green Party member of the London Assembly, asked new mayor of London Sadiq Khan to review the business case for a tram service via Waterloo Bridge and Elephant & Castle. London SE1 Community Website ‚Äì 29 May 2008 Khan subsequently stated that he had no plans to revive the cancelled tram scheme, and expressed the view that improved Tube services and the extension of the London Overground through south London suburbs, along with the proposed re- opening of Camberwell railway station, would meet the transport needs along the corridor that would have been served by the Cross River Tram.

ASPA is responsible for catalyzing the deacylation of N-acetyl-l-aspartate (N-acetylaspartate') into aspartate and acetate. It is a zinc-dependent hydrolase that promotes the deprotonation of water to use as a nucleophile in a mechanism analogous to many other zinc-dependent hydrolases. It is most commonly found in the brain, where it controls the levels of N-actetyl-l-aspartate. Mutations that result in loss of aspartoacylase activity are associated with Canavan disease, a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. Structure Aspartoacylase is a dimer of two identical monomers of 313 amino acids and uses a zinc cofactor in each. There are two distinct domains in each monomer: the N-terminal domain from residues 1-212 and the C-terminal domain from residues 213‚Äì313. The N-terminal domain of aspartoacylase is similar to that of zinc-dependent hydrolases such as carboxypeptidaseA. However, carboxypeptidases do not have something similar to the C-domain. In carboxypeptidase A, the active site is accessible to large substrates like the bulky C-terminal residue of polypeptides, whereas the C-domain sterically hinders access to the active site in aspartoacylase. Instead, the N-domain and C-domain of aspartoacylase form a deep narrow channel that leads to the active site. The zinc cofactor is found at the active site and is held by Glu-24, His-21, and His 116. The substrate is held in place by Arg-63, Asn-70, Arg-71, Tyr-164, Arg-168, and Tyr-288. The zinc cofactor is used to lower the pKa of a ligated water so that an attack on N-acetyl-L-aspartate may occur and to stabilize the resulting tetrahedral intermediate along with Arg-63, and Glu-178. A monomer of aspartoacylase with the N-domain in green, C-domain in yellow, and zinc cofactor in red. Generated from 2I3C.Active site of aspartoacylase with a bound N-phosphonamidate-L- aspartate. This is a tetrahedral intermediate analogue with phosphorus replacing the attacked carbon. In the structure, zinc, Arg-63, and Glu-178 are stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate. Generated from 2O4H. Mechanism There are two types of possible mechanisms for zinc-dependent hydrolases depending on what is the nucleophile. The first uses deprotonated water and the second attacks with an aspartate or glutamate first forming an anhydride. Aspartoacylase follows the deprotonated water mechanism. Zinc lowers the pKa of a ligated water molecule and the reaction proceeds via an attack on N-acetyl-l-aspartate when the water molecule is deprotonated by Glu-178. This leads to a tetrahedral intermediate that is stabilized by the zinc, Arg-63, and Glu-178. Finally, the carbonyl is then reformed, the bond with nitrogen is broken, and the nitrogen is protonated by the proton taken by Glu-178 all in one concerted step. Aspartoacylase mechanism. All the coordinating residues are not shown for clarity. Biological function Aspartoacylase is used to metabolize N-acetyl-L-aspartate by catalyzing its deacylation. Aspartoacylase prevents the buildup of N-acetyl-L-aspartate in the brain. It is believed that controlling N-acetyl-L-aspartate levels is essential for developing and maintaining white matter. It is not known why so much N-acetyl-L-aspartate is produced in the brain nor what its primary function is. However, one hypothesis is that it is potentially used as a chemical reservoir that can be tapped into for acetate for acetyl-CoA synthesis or aspartate for glutamate synthesis. This way, N-acetyl-L-aspartate can be used to transport these precursor molecules and aspartoacylase is used to release them. For example, N-acetyl-L-aspartate produced in neurons can be transported into oligodendrocytes and the acetate released can be used for myelin synthesis. Another hypothesis is that N-acetyl-L-aspartate is essential osmolyte that acts as a molecular water pump that helps maintain a proper fluid balance in the brain. Disease Relevance Mutations that lead to loss of aspartoacylase activity have been identified as the cause of Canavan disease. Canavan disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes spongy degeneration of the white matter in the brain and severe psychomotor retardation, usually leading to death at a young age. The loss of aspartoacylase activity leads to the buildup of N-acetyl-L-aspartate in the brain and an increase in urine concentration by up to 60 times normal levels. Though the exact mechanism of how loss of aspartoacylase activity leads to Canavan disease is not fully understood, there are two primary competing explanations. The first is that it leads to defective myelin synthesis due to a deficiency of acetyl-CoA derived from the acetate product. Another explanation is that the elevated levels of N-acetyl-l-aspartate interfere with its normal brain osmoregulatory mechanism leading to osmotic disequilibrium. There are over 70 reported mutations of this enzyme, but the most common ones are the amino acid substitutions E285A and A305E. E285A reduces activity of aspartoacylase down to as low as 0.3% of its normal function and is found in 98% of cases with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. The mutation A305E is found in about 40% of non-Jewish patients and reduces activity to about 10%. Of these two mutations, a crystal structure of the E285A mutant has been taken, showing that the loss of the hydrogen bonding from glutamate leads to a conformational change that distorts the active site and alters the substrate binding, leading to the much lower catalytic activity. Distortion of the active site caused by the E285A mutation. Wild type ASPA is on the left (2O4H) and E285A on the right (4NFR).

Career Born in Hammersmith, London, Cook began his career at Southampton before moving on to non-League club Aylesbury United where he made 19 appearances, of which 14 were in the league, scoring twice, having progressed from the club's youth team. Watford In 1999, after impressing in a trial period, Cook moved on to Watford. His transfer was the subject of an unsuccessful lawsuit from his former club. Cook made his debut against Grimsby Town on 14 April 2001 as a substitute. In his fourth game for Watford he injured his knee, which kept him out of football until the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season. Cook spent most of the 2002‚Äì03 season on loan. He joined York City on a month's loan in October 2002, which was extended for another month in late October. For York, he made a total of seven appearances and scored twice, with goals against Exeter in the league and Lincoln City in the Football League Trophy. He was subsequently loaned to Queens Park Rangers in December 2002. Cook returned to Watford in March 2003, after QPR manager Ian Holloway had been hoping to sign him permanently. He scored once during 13 starts at Loftus Road. Cook made most his appearances for Watford during the 2003‚Äì04 season, playing 45 times. Queens Park Rangers Cook made no secret of the fact he was a fan of QPR, and he elected to leave Watford to join them at the end of his contract in July 2004. As Cook was under the age of 24 when he moved, and the two clubs failed to agree a fee, a tribunal ordered QPR to pay a fee of ¬£125,000 to Watford. During his five-year spell at Watford he made 64 appearances and scored seven goals. Cook's QPR debut came against Watford at Vicarage Road on 9 August 2004 as a second-half substitute. Cook played poorly in the 3‚Äì0 defeat and was jeered by the Watford crowd. He was ruled out for six weeks in August 2005 after tearing his lateral knee ligament against Hull City. Cook played a significant role in QPR's battle to avoid relegation in the 2006‚Äì07 season, and he formed a great partnership with striker Dexter Blackstock. QPR rejected a bid from Fulham for Cook in June 2007, but he eventually joined them for ¬£2.5 million on 19 July 2007, signing a four-year contract. Cook gave his ¬£250,000 signing-on fee to QPR as a parting gift to the club. He joined Charlton Athletic on loan until the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season in January 2008. He rejoined former club Queens Park Rangers on loan for the 2008‚Äì09 season in July 2008, with a view to a permanent move. Fulham manager Roy Hodgson confirmed on 5 December that Cook would sign a permanent contract with Queens Park Rangers for a fee of ¬£850,000, which could rise to ¬£1.2 million. He completed the move on 8 January 2009, signing a three-year contract, for an undisclosed fee. On 19 March 2012, Cook rejoined Charlton Athletic on loan until the end of the season. Leyton Orient On 24 August 2012, Cook joined Football League One side Leyton Orient on a five-month contract, after his release from QPR. After 54 appearances and six goals in all competitions (including his loan spell), he rejected a contract extension at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season. On 6 January 2014 he signed a six-month contract with Apollon Smyrni in the Greek Super League. He played four times for the club, once in the league, before leaving at the end of the season after their relegation to the Football League.

McCrindle in 1959, and published at first in Rome, then London and New York. McCrindle revived the title of the original Paris Transatlantic Review founded by Ford Madox Ford in 1924. History McCrindle's first intention was to publish short stories and poetry that he had not been able to place as a literary agent. He was inspired in part by the periodical Botteghe Oscure, which was based in Rome and published by Marguerite Caetani. Eugene Walter provided a connection between the two; after helping launch The Paris Review, he edited Caetani's magazine for a while and was a contributing editor to Transatlantic Review from the third issue until the last. George Garrett was one of a group of initially credited editors, including William Goldman, and by issue 3 became the poetry editor, continuing alongside B. S. Johnson up until issue 39. Another significant contributing editor was the playwright, poet and actor Heathcote Williams. In the long run, TR, as it was often called, brought together a mixture of essays, interviews, short stories and poetry in a publication that ran for 60 issues between 1959 and 1977. Seven O. Henry Award-winning stories came from its pages. McCrindle's goal was to strike a balance between leading writers and new, sometimes unpublished, ones, and, as the title implies, between American and British writers. B. S. Johnson was eventually the sole poetry editor and assembled the feature, \\"New Transatlantic Poetry\\". He also proposed the annual Erotica competition, which was open to fiction, poetry and illustration and ran for three years. Prize- winners included Paul Ableman, Diana Athill, Gavin Ewart, Giles Gordon, D. M. Thomas, Jerry Stahl, Jay Jeff Jones, Trevor Hoyle, Patrick Hughes and Steve Barthelme. Issue 52 (Autumn 1975), featured An Anthology of New American Poetry, compiled by Gerard Malanga. It included work by Charles Bukowski, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, Jonathan Williams, Gary Snyder, Michael McClure, Harold Norse and Lou Reed. After a decade, McCrindle selected the magazine's best for his Stories from the Transatlantic Review (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970; Penguin, 1974), an anthology that included Paul Bowles, Jerome Charyn, Bruce Jay Friedman, Penelope Gilliatt, William Goldman and Joyce Carol Oates. McCrindle collected the interviews in Behind the Scenes: Theater and Film Interviews from the Transatlantic Review (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971). The final issue was published June 1977. An announcement appeared in the penultimate issue of the magazine saying that the title would continue as an annual review but this idea was not pursued. After he folded the magazine, McCrindle continued to support new writing talent through the Henfield Foundation (later renamed the Joseph F. McCrindle Foundation), awarding annual Henfield Prizes for the best short stories from writing programs throughout the United States. He died July 11, 2008 at his home in New York City. Writers J. G. Ballard, Samuel Beckett, Anthony Burgess, William S. Burroughs, Jean Cocteau, William Faulkner, Alan Lelchuk, Robert Grossbach, Iris Murdoch, Alan Sillitoe, John Updike, Richard Yates, Harold Pinter, William Trevor, John Banville and other well-known authors appeared in the publication. Many issues featured interviews with theater and film directors, authors and playwrights, such as Eugene Walter's 1960 interview with Gore Vidal and Giles Gordon's 1964 interview with Joe Orton, which appeared shortly before Orton was murdered. Other interviewees included Edward Albee, Burgess (twice), Federico Fellini, William Gaskill, William Inge and Christopher Isherwood, Pinter and Peter Yates. After TR was shut down in 1977, annual fiction prizes were given by the Henfield Foundation, later renamed the Joseph F. McCrindle Foundation. In 2011, the McCrindle Foundation set up endowments to support fiction prizes at five graduate writing programs: Columbia University, University of Virginia, University of Iowa, University of Michigan, and University of California at Irvine. Illustrators The only issue of Transatlantic Review that did not contain an illustration was the debut issue. The second issue had only one, by Jean Cocteau, but illustration soon became a staple item, usually unrelated to the text but in some cases complementing short stories or articles. Contributors of illustration included Dylan Thomas, Peter Farmer, Elaine de Kooning, Daniel Mroz, Mervyn Peake, Patrick Procktor, Kaffe Fassett, Mike McGear, Heathcote Williams,John(H) Howard, Larry Rivers, Mabel Pakenham-Walsh and Colin Spencer. Archives The Transatlantic Review papers, available at Special Collections and University Archives, Rutgers University, include manuscripts by TR contributors such as J.G. Ballard, Ann Beattie, Jorge Luis Borges, Paul Bowles, William Burroughs, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates, Edna O‚ÄôBrien, Grace Paley, Harold Pinter, Paul Theroux, William Trevor, John Updike, and Richard Yates. The Joseph F. McCrindle papers at Columbia University Libraries Archival Collections include, in addition to extensive personal correspondence, letters and manuscripts by L.P. Hartley, Philip Roth, and other writers represented by McCrindle when he was a literary agent. Digitized papers at the Archives of American Art document McCrindle's art collecting, art donations, philanthropy, family affairs, and personal estate. All issues of Transatlantic Review have been digitized and archived at JSTOR. Contents of Stories from the Transatlantic Review *\\"Introduction\\" ‚Ä¢ Joseph F.

He is known for being one of the first Christian Egyptian writers to use the Arabic language. His writings include the chronicle Nazm al-Jauhar (\\"Row of Jewels\\"), also known by its Latin title Eutychii Annales (\\"The Annals of Eutychius\\"). Life He was born in Fustat (old Cairo). Eutychius spent much of his life as a medical practitioner or Mutatabbib. His life was roughly contemporary with Agapius the historian, although neither displays knowledge of the other. He did not know Greek, but was able to access Greek texts in existing Syriac translations. In 932 he became the Melkite Patriarch of Alexandria at the age of 60. Because he had never held any clerical office, his appointment met with considerable opposition, which lasted the remainder of his life. His appointment was probably due to the influence of the Moslem rulers.Reinhard Pummer, Early Christian Authors on Samaritans and Samaritanism, p.430 Works Eutychius' chronicle (in French) The most important work is the Nazm al-Jauhar, a world chronicle, which he began before becoming Patriarch, and dedicated to his brother. It begins with the Creation, and runs down to his own times. His Nazm al-Jauhar is a valuable source for events in Persia prior to the rise of Islam and the later Sassanid rulers. For events after the rise of Islam, Eutychius makes use of Muslim sources. He also drew on legendary and hagiographical material. > Eutychii Annales:Eutychii Annales CHAPTER II: ADVERSITIES OF THE CHURCH.: 1 > Persecutions of the Christians.: ...The Christians suffered less in this > than in the preceding centuries. ...In the East especially in Syria and > Palestine the Jews sometimes rose upon the Christians with great violence > (Eutychius, Annales tom ii., p. 236, &c.; Jo.

( Mosheim 1847, p. 426, at Google Books) The history was adapted and continued to 1028 by Yahya ibn Sa'id, in which form it became known in Antioch and then Europe; but it continued to be expanded, and to circulate in this modified form. Numerous copies were made. However the autograph was recently located at Mount Sinai (Sinaiticus Arabicus 582). The start and end of the manuscript are missing, but can be reconstructed from copies.Reinhard Pummer, Early Christian Authors on Samaritans and Samaritanism, p.431 Other works are a book on medicine and an apologetic work.

It began with a conflict over the borders of the Spanish city of Ceuta and was fought in northern Morocco. Morocco sued for peace after the Spanish victory at the Battle of Tetu√°n. Background Throughout the 19th century, Morocco suffered military defeats at the hands of the Europeans, notably in the Franco-Moroccan War in 1844. In 1856 the British were able to pressure Morocco into signing the Anglo-Moroccan treaties of Friendship which instated limitations on Moroccan Customs duties and brought an end to Royal monopolies. The course of the war The casus belli for Spain were the unrelenting attacks of Berber tribesmen on Spanish settlements in North Africa; following unfruitful negotiations with Sultan Abd al-Rahman vis-√†-vis the reparations (the latter, unable to control the cabilas, actually died in the midst of negotiations and was replaced by his brother Muhammad IV), a declaration of war propelled by Leopoldo O'Donnell was unanimously passed by the Congress of Deputies on 22 October 1859. Spanish infantry during the war, by Jos√© Benlliure. The Spaniards reached Tetu√°n on February 3, 1860. They bombarded the city for the following two days which allowed chaos to reign free. Riffian tribesmen poured into the city and pillaged it (mainly the Jewish quarters). The Moroccan historian Ahmad ibn Khalid al-Nasiri described the looting during the bombardment: > A tumult broke out in the town,... the hand of the mob stretched out to > plunder, and even [normal] people took off the cloak of decency.... People > of the Jabal, and the Arabs, and the riffraff began to pillage and steal; > they broke down the doors of the houses and the shops.... keeping at it the > whole night until the morning On February 5 the Spanish entered the city, ending both the battle and the war.  Aftermath  The Peace of Wad-Ras, by Joaqu√≠n Dom√≠nguez B√©cquer (1870). Following an armistice of 32 days, the Treaty of Wad-Ras or Peace of T√©touan was signed on 26 April 1860. The treaty contemplated the extension on perpetuity of the Spanish presence in Ceuta and Melilla, the end of tribal raids on those cities, the recognition by Morocco of Spanish sovereignty over the Chafarinas Islands, the retrocession of the territory of Santa Cruz de la Mar Peque√±a (a territory of uncertain location by that time, ultimately Sidi Ifni) to Spain in order to establish a fishing post, the permission to missionaries for establishing a Christian church in T√©touan, and the Spanish administration over the later city until reparations of duros were paid. Once Morocco paid the compensation (partially through money lent by the British), O'Donnell retired his troops from T√©touan.

Lord Justice Fulford, is a Lord Justice of Appeal and became, in 2017, the first Investigatory Powers Commissioner., a post he held until October 2019, when he became Vice-President of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division), in succession to Lady Justice Hallett DBE. https://www.judiciary.uk/announcements/appointment-of-the-vice-president-of- the-court-of-appeal-criminal-division/ Previously, he was a judge of the International Criminal Court in The Hague from 2003‚Äì12, the Senior Presiding Judge for England and Wales from January 2016 to March 2017, and former member of the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL). Early life Fulford was born on 8 January 1953. He was educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey and went up to the University of Southampton, gaining a LL.B. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple as a barrister in 1978, and appointed Queen's Counsel in 1994. Judicial career Fulford was made a Recorder of the Crown Court in 1995 (re-appointed in 2001). His appointment as a High Court judge on 21 November 2002 was the first for an openly homosexual QC. He was appointed to the Queen's Bench Division and received the customary knighthood. Though he became a judge of the International Criminal Court in 2003, Fulford continued his work at the High Court, presiding over a number of high-profile cases. Among these were the 21 July 2005 London bombings trial, the trial of terrorist plotter Saajid Badat and the trial of PC Simon Harwood. Fulford's term on the ICC ended on 11 March 2012. On 11 May 2012, Fulford imposed a whole life order on David Oakes, who was convicted at the Crown Court at Chelmsford of the premeditated and sadistic murder of his former partner and daughter. Fulford also presided over the trial of Jiervon Barlett and Najed Hoque who were accused of the manslaughter of Paula Castle, a woman mugged in Greenford West London. He sentenced them to 13 years. Fulford was elected to serve as one of the 18 judges of the International Criminal Court in 2003 for a term of nine years, and was assigned to the Trial Division. He was sworn into office on 11 March 2003. He presided over the ICC's first trial, that of Thomas Lubanga, and delivered the court's first guilty verdict on 14 March 2012. On 10 May 2013, Fulford was appointed a Lord Justice of Appeal. He was awarded an honorary LL.D. by the University of Southampton in 2011.Profile, southampton.ac.uk; accessed 26 March 2016. In March 2014, the Mail on Sunday alleged that Fulford had been a supporter of the Pedophile Information Exchange (PIE) in the 1970s. Following this allegation, he stepped down from judging criminal cases and an official investigation by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office took place. The investigation, by Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, concluded on 18 June 2014 that the allegations against Fulford were \\"without substance\\" and he \\"was not and had never been a supporter of PIE or its aims\\". Following his exoneration, Fulford resumed sitting as a judge on the full range of appeals. Fulford was appointed as the Deputy Senior Presiding Judge on 1 January 2015, and was promoted to Senior Presiding Judge on 1 January 2016 succeeding Peter Gross. On 31 March 2017, Fulford stood down from this position, to accept the appointment as the Investigatory Powers Commissioner.https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/announcements/appointment-of-the- new-senior-presiding-judge/ References 1953 births Living people Alumni of the University of Southampton English Queen's Counsel English barristers English judges International Criminal Court judges Knights Bachelor LGBT judges LGBT people from England Gay men Lords Justices of Appeal Members of the Middle Temple Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom People educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey Queen's Bench Division judges Queen's Counsel 1901‚Äì2000 British judges of international courts and tribunals ","title":"Adrian Fulford"},{"id":"6330091","text":"Live at the Palladium is a live concert DVD by the punk band Bad Religion, released in March 2006.

She was named after the star Alshain in the constellation Aquila, and served as a commissioned ship for 11 years and 9 months. Alshain (AKA-55) was laid down on 29 October 1943 under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 209) at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Co., launched on 26 January 1944, sponsored by Mrs. J. H. King, acquired by the Navy on 31 March 1944, and placed in commission at Brooklyn, New York, on 1 April 1944, Commander (later Captain) Roland E. Krause in command, succeeded by Comdr. (later Capt.) B.W. Strickland. Other officers on the ship included, Comdr. L.B. Swann, Lt.Comdr. G.R. Kilburn, Lt.Comdr. Mitchell Justice, Lt. Tierney, Lt. Batson, and Lt. Lexey R. Shields. Service history=World War II, 1944-1945 After fitting out at the New York Navy Yard, the new attack cargo ship got underway for shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay. She entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for an availability on 27 April, took on cargo early in May, and sailed for the Hawaiian Islands on the 13th. Alshain transited the Panama Canal, joined the Pacific Fleet, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 2 June. There, she reported for duty to Commander, Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet. The ship was ordered to return to San Diego to serve as an amphibious training ship, and she set a course for the west coast of the United States. Alshain reached San Diego on 20 June but was ordered to replenish fuel and provisions and return to Hawaii. Upon her arrival at Pearl Harbor on the 28th, she was assigned to temporary Transport Division (TransDiv) 38 and began loading combat cargo and Army personnel scheduled to participate in the invasion of Guam. On 1 July, the vessel set sail for Eniwetok to join Task Force 51 as a part of the Southern Transport Group. The combined forces sortied from that atoll on 17 July and arrived off Agat Beach, Guam, on the 21st. Landing operations began early that morning. Alshain had difficulty unloading her cargo due to a shortage of boats and congestion on the beach itself. She finally completed the process on 3 August and retired toward Eniwetok. The ship then sailed independently to Pearl Harbor where she embarked more Army troops and loaded their equipment before getting underway on 27 August for amphibious landing rehearsals at Lahaina Roads, Maui. On 15 September, Alshain sailed with Task Group (TG) 33.1 for Eniwetok and a planned invasion of Yap. However, the attack on Yap was later cancelled, and Leyte, Philippines, was substituted as an objective. The cargo vessel departed Eniwetok on 26 September, bound for Manus, Admiralty Islands, the forward staging area for the assault on Leyte. Alshain reached that port on 3 October and made final preparations for the invasion of the Philippines. On 14 October, she sortied with TG 79.1 which entered Leyte Gulf on the 20th. Alshain anchored in the transport area off Dulag, Leyte, and began lowering her boats at 0730. Despite enemy air harassment, the unloading proceeded so smoothly that the ship completed her work on the 23rd and headed back to Seeadler Harbor, Manus. Getting underway again on 7 November, Alshain proceeded to Hollandia, New Guinea, to take on the personnel and material of the Army Air Service Command. She then rendezvoused with other ships off Biak, Schouten Islands, to form Task Unit (TU) 79.15.4, which proceeded to Leyte Gulf to reinforce Allied forces in the Philippines. The task unit arrived in the waters off Tanauan, Leyte, on the 118th and underwent a Japanese air attack that morning. Alshain joined the others in firing on the enemy intruders. One \\"A6M Zero\\" approached the cargo ship and dived from directly astern in what seemed to be a strafing or dive bombing attack. However, intense antiaircraft fire caused the plane to burst into flames, and it splashed close aboard , anchored away. The next day, Alshain left Tanauan to return to Seeadler Harbor. On 28 November, the cargo ship sailed for Finschhafen, New Guinea; paused there on the 29th; and then pressed on to Bougainville, Solomon Islands, arriving in Empress Augusta Bay on 1 December. She embarked members of the 37th Infantry Division and got underway on the 16th for training exercises in Huon Gulf, New Guinea. Alshain finished the exercises and returned to Manus on the 21st. On the last day of 1944, she sortied with TG 79.1 for the assault on Luzon, Philippines. The ships passed through Surigao Strait, the Mindanao and Sulu Seas, and entered the South China Sea on 8 January 1945. On that day, when a small group of enemy planes attacked the transports, Alshain helped to fight off the attack. She continued on toward Luzon, entered the Lingayen Gulf on the 9th, and unloaded her cargo. The ship then returned to Leyte to embark personnel for landings to be conducted in the San Felipe-San Narciso area of Luzon. The vessel sailed on 26 January to waters off Luzon, disembarked her passengers on the 29th, and returned to Leyte Gulf on 1 February. During the next two months, the cargo ship remained in Philippine waters replenishing supplies, assisting in unloading merchant ships, and carrying out training exercises in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa. She left the Philippines on 27 March with Task Unit (TU) 51.13.1 and arrived off Okinawa on 1 April. The Japanese struck back with numerous air attacks against Allied shipping in an attempt to ward off the assault. On 1 April, a kamikaze crashed into Alpine which was anchored some away. Alshain rescued a badly burned soldier who had been blown off Alpine's deck by the crash. The attack cargo ship completed her unloading on the 5th, withdrew from the area, and headed for Apra Harbor, Guam. She then proceeded via Pearl Harbor to Seattle, Washington, where she entered the Lake Washington Shipyard, Houghton, Washington, on 2 May for an availability. After the completion of the yard period on the 18th, the ship took on cargo at Tacoma, Washington, and proceeded to San Francisco. During this run, trouble developed with the superheater tubes in the boilers. Alshain entered the Bethlehem Steel Co. repair yard at San Francisco on 2 June for two weeks of repair work. On the 16th, the ship set a course for Eniwetok and spent a fortnight in port there in early July before getting underway for Guam. Alshain reached Apra Harbor on 18 July and discharged a portion of her provisions. Her next destination was Tulagi, Solomon Islands, where she paused on 10 August to take on supplies. The vessel reached Noum√©a, New Caledonia, on the 14th. Here, she received word of Japan's capitulation. After the end of the war, Alshain continued her role as a cargo supply ship. Among the islands she served during the next three months were Eniwetok, Guam, and Okinawa. The ship reached Pearl Harbor on 3 December and discharged her cargo. On the 16th, she got underway for Seattle, Washington. On that same day, the ship also detached from Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet. Alshain reached Seattle on 23 December and prepared to enter the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for an extended availability. Inter-war service, 1946-1950 In May 1946, the ship was assigned to the Naval Transport Service and resumed her cargo supply runs to various points in the Pacific. She left San Francisco on 7 June for a cruise via Pearl Harbor to Okinawa and Sasebo, Japan. She departed Japanese waters on 7 August bound for the east coast of the United States. The vessel transited the Panama Canal on 2 September and reached Norfolk on the 8th. She remained there for a month and then made a brief trip to Davisville, Rhode Island. After touching back at Norfolk, Alshain continued on south to transit the Panama Canal on 21 October and reached Terminal Island, California, on the 30th. Alshain commenced another tour of Far Eastern ports on 22 November. Among her ports of call were Guam; Pearl Harbor; Yokosuka, Japan; Tsingtao and Shanghai, China; Okinawa; and Subic Bay and Samar, Philippines. Alshain arrived back in San Francisco on 7 August 1947 and spent five months there, interrupted only briefly late in November by a run to San Diego. On 2 January 1948, the vessel began a series of trips carrying supplies and equipment to Guam from San Francisco. Four were completed between January and August 1948. After a period of yard work at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in October and November, Alshain got underway for the western Pacific. During this trip, she carried several tons of ammunition to Chinese Nationalist forces on Formosa; delivered supplies at Subic Bay and Yokohama, Japan; visited the ports of Shanghai and Tsingtao on the Chinese mainland; and touched at Guam before reporting back to San Francisco on 7 March 1949. Alshain operated along the west coast from March through July. On 21 July, the ship set out from San Francisco, bound via Pearl Harbor for Guam, where she arrived on 7 August. During her stay at that island, the cargo ship became a part of the newly formed Military Sea Transportation Service and was reclassified as USNS Alshain (T-AKA-55). She left Guam on 15 September, transited the Panama Canal on 9 October, and arrived off Onslow Beach, N.C., on the 15th. Two weeks later the vessel moved to the Hampton Roads area but sailed for Caribbean waters on 10 November, and touched at Port-au-Prince, Haiti, four days later. After paying one more call at Norfolk, Alshain transited the Panama Canal on 15 December, reached San Francisco on 30 December, and closed the year there in upkeep. Alshain set sail for Guam on 26 January 1950. She arrived back at San Diego on 27 March. After operations along the California coast, the cargo ship shaped a course for Japan on 26 April. She visited Yokosuka and Yokohama in May and touched at Naha, Okinawa, and Guam before pulling back into port at San Francisco on 26 June.  Korean War, 1950-1953 The outbreak of war in Korea caused Alshain to depart San Diego on 14 July with elements of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade embarked for transportation to Korea. The ship sailed with TG 53.7 from Yokosuka to Pusan, Korea, where she arrived on 2 August. Upon completion of debarking operations, the cargo vessel reached Yokosuka on the 7th. The ship then passed under the control of Amphibious Group 1, was fitted out to receive special boats for amphibious operations, and conducted training exercises late in August in Chigasaki Bay off Honsh≈´, Japan. Alshain reported to Kobe, Japan, on 2 September to take on equipment, supplies, and personnel of the 1st Marine Division. On the 11th, she got underway for the invasion of Inchon, Korea. The vessel entered the transport area off Inchon on 15 September and began unloading operations which continued until the 21st. Touching at Kobe on the 24th, Alshain embarked supplies and equipment of the 1st Marine Division and Marine Air Group 33 and moved to Sasebo, Japan, on 9 October to top off her fuel tanks before getting underway later that same day for Inchon. On 11 October, Alshain reached the Inchon area and loaded equipment and supplies for an upcoming amphibious operation. She departed Inchon on the 17th with TG 90.2, bound for Wonsan, Korea. However, clearance of mines delayed the start of the assault on Wonsan; and the task group was forced to retire along its approach route and wait. In the interim, South Korean forces moving north captured Wonsan and obviated the need for an assault landing. Thus when Alshain returned on the 26th to unload cargo and disembark troops, no enemy harassed her cargo operations, and she completed the mission on the 31st. Alshain retraced her course to Japan and arrived at Moji on the island of Kyushu on 2 November. There, she began embarking troops of the 3rd Infantry Division for transportation to Wonsan. The ship arrived in the Wonsan area on 14 November and, by the 17th, had completed discharging her passengers. She then paused briefly at Yokohama for a four-day availability period before setting out for the west coast of the United States on 25 November. The vessel reached San Francisco on 11 December. After three months of local operations and upkeep, Alshain left California on 16 March 1951, bound for the east coast. She navigated the Panama Canal on 1 April and continued on to Norfolk, where she arrived on the 15th. The ship left the Military Sea Transportation Service on 30 April to become a member of Amphibious Forces, Atlantic Fleet, and was assigned to TransDiv 23. She was involved in a series of local operations and training exercises at Onslow Beach, N.C., through 4 August when she got underway for her first Mediterranean cruise. The ship replenished ships of the 6th Fleet at Golfe Juan, France, from 17 August to 25 August. She then proceeded to Port Lyautey, Morocco, and replenished naval shore activities located there. Early September found Alshain back in her new home port, Norfolk. Her next mission sent the cargo ship to Morehead City, N.C., to take on marines for participation in LantFlex 52 off Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. Alshain arrived at Vieques on 1 October. During the cruise, were also made port calls at Bridgetown, Barbados, and Port of Spain, Trinidad. The ship left the Caribbean on 5 November, took part in an amphibious landing exercise on Onslow Beach on the 13th, and arrived back in Norfolk on the 18th. In early January 1952, Alshain commenced her second Mediterranean tour. Her first stop was Naples, Italy, on 24 January. She then made a short trip to Suda Bay, Crete, and returned to Naples on 9 February. From 25 February through 16 March, the ship took part in Operation Grand Slam, held in conjunction with naval units of NATO allies. She later made port calls at Porto Scudo and Palermo, Sicily; Iraklion, Crete; Phaleron Bay, Greece; Beirut, Lebanon; and Cannes, France. Returning from her Mediterranean cruise to Norfolk on 24 May, Alshain engaged in various exercises off the eastern seaboard and in Puerto Rican waters. A visit to New York City during the Fourth of July holiday period highlighted the ship's summer. After a three-week layover in the Norfolk area during the Christmas holidays, Alshain got underway on 4 January 1953 for amphibious landing exercises at Vieques. In late January, she headed north and entered the Boston Naval Shipyard on 1 February for availability. Alshain resumed operations on 18 April and headed down the east coast toward the Caribbean for refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which lasted from 10 until 29 May. During this period, the cargo vessel was involved in two minor collisions: one with command ship on 13 May, and the other a few days later with oiler . These necessitated a restricted availability for the cargo ship for repairs from 23 June through 3 July at the Maryland Drydock Company of Baltimore, Maryland. Upon completion of the yard work, Alshain began operations along the east coast. In late September, she transported marines from Morehead City to Vieques Island for amphibious training exercises. She returned to home port on 3 October and closed the year in an upkeep status. The cargo ship moved to Boston in late January 1953 for a period of repairs and alterations which lasted through mid-April. Alshain sailed for the Caribbean from Norfolk on 6 May. She visited Guantanamo Bay and Port-au-Prince before reversing course back to Norfolk.  Post-war service, 1953-1955 The ship operated in the Norfolk area through 8 August, when she got underway for a cruise to Yokohama with a cargo of ammunition, air base equipment, and personnel of Marine Aircraft Group 11. She touched en route at Port Everglades, Florida; transited the Panama Canal on 15 August; visited San Diego for two days in late August; and finally reached Yokohama on 10 September. The cargo ship discharged her passengers and their equipment in Japan and got underway for her return trip on the 16th. Brief layovers at San Francisco, California, and Balboa, Canal Zone, preceded her arrival in Norfolk on 22 October. The ship then entered an extended tender availability. She began the year 1954 with a trip to the Caribbean for TRAEX 2-54 at Vieques Island. On 19 January, Alshain touched at Port Everglades and took on board elements of Marine Aircraft Group 32. After debarking the troops at Morehead City, the cargo ship returned to Norfolk on the 28th. For the duration of 1954, Alshain was engaged in a series of short training cruises. In mid-February, she made a round-trip voyage to San Juan and Vieques, Puerto Rico, for landing operations and, upon her return, entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an availability. She then operated in the area of Norfolk and Little Creek, Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay, and Onslow Beach and Morehead City, N.C. The ship was involved in LANTFLEX 1-55 in November off Onslow Beach. Alshain began her last year of active duty, 1955, by picking up elements of the Fleet Marine Force at Morehead City. On 7 January 1955, she left the east coast en route to the Mediterranean. Alshain touched at Mers El K√©bir, Algeria, on the 20th. She was then involved in amphibious operations in the Gulf of Arzew off Algeria. The ship continued on to visit Genoa and Naples, Italy; Istanbul, Turkey; Athens and Phaleron Bay, Greece; Suda Bay, Crete; Cannes and Marseilles, France; Porto Scudo, Sardinia; and Barcelona, Spain. Alshain left Barcelona on 14 May and shaped a course back to the United States. Upon her arrival at Norfolk on the 28th, the ship began a period of leave and upkeep.  Decommissioning and scrapping, 1955-1978 Alshain got underway in late June for Philadelphia. She entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 1 July to undergo pre-inactivation overhaul. The work was completed in early October, and the vessel proceeded to Orange, Texas, where she was placed in a reserve status on 12 October 1955. The ship was decommissioned on 14 January 1956. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1960. She was transferred to the Maritime Administration and laid up at Beaumont, Texas. She was sold for scrap on 16 February 1978.Maritime Administration Ship Record Detail: Alshain  Awards  USS Alshain earned five battle stars for her World War II service, and as USNS Alshain three battle stars for Korean War service.

Arsenius was most likely of Byzantine Greek origin, possibly of the provincial aristocracy of Sicily who were captured in the wars against the Byzantines there sometime before 965. His sister became a favourite concubine of the Fatimid caliph al-Aziz Billah (), and mother of the celebrated princess Sitt al-Mulk. Through her influence he was appointed metropolitan bishop of Fustat and Cairo in January 986, and Patriarch of Alexandria in June 1000. His brother Orestes was likewise the Greek Patriarch of Jerusalem in 986‚Äì1006. Other modern scholars consider the brothers to have been related to a different concubine, the mother of Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (), and thus maternal uncles to the caliph. Arsenius frequently resided at the monastery of Dayr al-Qasir (\\"Monastery of the Dwarf\\") on the Muqattam hills south of Fustat, which he fortified with a wall and rebuilt and expanded. His brother left for Constantinople in 1000 to negotiate a treaty between the Fatimid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire, and remained there until his death in 1006. During his absence, and the subsequent vacancy of the patriarchal throne, Arsenios was the steward of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem as well. During his ascendancy, Arsenius used his influence at court to strengthen the Melkites against the Coptic Church. When al-Hakim began to persecute Christians, however, starting with the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1009, Arsenius and his monastery too were not spared: on 18 April 1010, the monastery was destroyed, and even the cemeteries outside its walls were reportedly dug up. Arsenius himself was secretly executed in July of the same year.

Anticipating the seriousness of the shipping downturn starting in the late 1970s, he drastically reduced his fleet and was able to pay off associated debt and raise cash to diversify his interests notably through the purchase of a controlling stake in The Hongkong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Company Limited (now known as Wharf (Holdings)) and later Wheelock Marden giving an exposure to Hong Kong real estate, shipping terminals, retail, ferries and trams. He was noted for his unmatched access to leaders in both the commercial and political arenas and was equally at ease with Western political leaders and the Chinese leadership in the run up to Hong Kong's ceasing to be a British colony in 1997 (for example Margaret Thatcher wrote the foreword to his biography published in 1990 and he was appointed a Vice-Chairman of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee planning Hong Kong's constitution after 1997). He was also a generous philanthropist notably in educational projects (helping set up universities, libraries and scholarship schemes). He died in 1991 but his corporate legacy continues to be controlled and run by his family. Early life Pao was born in 1918 in Ningbo, the third of seven children of an upper-middle-class family. He was a 29th-generation descendant of Bao Zheng. In 1931, he went to Hankou to work in his father's shoe manufacturing business whilst continuing his education at night. However, he decided that the shoe business did not suit him and he secured a traineeship with a foreign insurance company. By the age of twenty he was established in his new position and married his wife Huang Sue-Ing, who was chosen by his parents. In 1937, Hankou came under attack from the Japanese and Pao along with 70 colleagues moved to Hunan and then Shanghai whilst leaving his wife in the relative safety of Ningbo. As tension eased, he sent for his wife to join him.  Career  In the late 1930s in Shanghai, Pao found a position in the insurance department of the Central Trust of China. Pao was soon moving up the corporate ladder, moving into the area of banking, and moving to Hengyang and Chongqing as the progress of the war dictated. In 1945, at the end of the war, he was sent by the Government back to Shanghai to help set up and manage the new Municipal Bank and in a short time had worked his way to Deputy general manager, effectively in charge. Move to Hong Kong With the approaching fall of the \\"Bamboo Curtain\\", Pao and all his family had moved to Hong Kong by the spring of 1949, having managed to remit much of the family's assets and money before events made it impossible. It was impossible to resume a banking career and, given the prevailing uncertainties, he did not wish to commit to investing in machinery and land in Hong Kong, so Pao started an Import/Export business dealing in Chinese goods. Following the UN trade embargo resulting from China's entry into the Korean War, the company broadened its scope to Europe, although trade with China continued in a circuitous way through skilful exploitation of legal loopholes in the embargo. It was during the first half of the 1950s that Pao first made contact with Jake Saunders (who was running the Imports Department) and Guy Sayer (also working in the department) at the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Both were later to become Chief Manager and Chairman of the bank, and the relationship was to be a decisive element in the growth of Pao's businesses. Founding of World-Wide Shipping As his business grew, Pao looked around for suitable new ventures and in 1955 decided to branch into shipping (still focusing on assets that were not fixed in Hong Kong) and embarked on an intensive learning process. Shipowning in Hong Kong had a poor reputation at that time with the banks and so the first vessel, a 28-year-old coal burning 8,200 tonne freighter, was purchased without finance. Having seen this and the rigorousness employed by Pao in the purchase process, the Hongkong Bank extended a loan for the second purchase, the start of long and fruitful relationship which led to Pao being appointed to the board of the bank in 1971 and later to become its vice- chairman. The shipping business grew rapidly driven by the post war economic miracle taking place in Japan and the resulting need for freight and oil carrying capacity. Pao devised a system whereby he was able to secure bank guaranteed three-year charters prior to purchasing ships thus significantly reducing the business risks and creating a very attractive lending opportunity for the banks financing the ship purchase. This basic scheme (known in Japan as a \\"shikumisen\\" arrangement) was extended when World-Wide moved into commissioning construction of new ships in 1961. By 1979, the fleet was some 202 vessels with a total of , by far and away the largest fleet in the world. Indeed, the fleet was larger than the combined fleets of the famous Onassis, Niarchos and Lemos families. In recognition of his achievements Pao was made an Honorary Doctor of Law by the Hong Kong University in 1975, and in 1976 appeared on the front cover of Newsweek magazine with the heading \\"King of the Sea\\". Pao received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1977. He was knighted in 1978. Diversification 1978 saw the start of a severe downturn in the shipping business. Pao and his managers were quick to spot the problem and commenced a programme to reduce the fleet, especially crude oil carriers, selling ships as they came off charter. 140 ships were sold and the fleet reduced by half over a period of 4 to 5 years allowing debt to be paid off and cash resources built up. Although this was a difficult time for World-Wide, the company, through early action and conservative financial management, was able to ride the recession with little of the problems seen elsewhere in the industry. In the mid 1970s Pao had bought from Li Ka Shing a 10% holding in the Hong Kong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Co. Ltd and by 1977 had built this to 30%. Wharf had historically been in the Jardine Matheson sphere of influence. Friction with the Jardine camp broke out in the late 1970s over board appointments which concluded with the Pao camp being allowed two more directorships (making 4 out of a total 12). Hostilities broke out again in June 1980 with Jardines launching a cash and shares bid for Wharf. Although in Europe at the time, Pao and his team were able rapidly to put together a successful cash tender for shares to take his holding to 49% and securing control of Wharf. Pao then took over the roles of chairman and Chief Executive. Wharf gave World-Wide exposure to prime Kowloon waterfront property as well as ownership of Hong Kong Tramway and the Star Ferry. In 1985, Pao was able to take control of Wheelock Marden, one of Hong Kong's premier companies established in 1857, when John Cheung sold his 34% stake to Pao for HK$2.5 billion forming a core shareholding from which to launch a bid in opposition to the bid from Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat who had bought John Marden's 34% stake in the company. Wheelock gave World-Wide exposure to more prime central Hong Kong property as well as the Lane Crawford department store.  Retirement and other activities  In 1986, Pao retired from day-to-day management of the group handing over the shipping business to his son-in-law Helmut Sohmen and the Wheelock / Wharf interests to Peter Woo, another son-in-law. By 1989 he announced that he had given up his interests in the Trusts that held the Pao family assets (the shipping interests going to the Sohmen family and the Wheelock / Wharf interests going to the Woo family) and gave up his title as Honorary Chairman of World International. He had already retired from his directorship of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1983 when he hit the mandatory retirement age of 65 but continued to lead a very active life taking in advisory roles (formal and informal) and philanthropic activities. Over the years, Pao was on a number of corporate advisory committees including Chase Manhattan Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan, AT&T;, United Technologies Corporation and Caterpillar Inc.. Pao was active in philanthropic works and was particularly interested in educational projects. Among notable gifts were US$20m to found Ningbo University, a ¬£14m contribution to the Sino-British Friendship Scholarship scheme to enable Chinese students to attend British Universities and a US$10m gift to build a library at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  Personal  Pao had 4 daughters. On 23 September 1991, Pao died in Hong Kong at age 72. Legacy The YK Pao School in Shanghai was founded in memory of Sir Yue-Kong Pao. Yue-Kong Pao Hall at Purdue University and the Pao Yue-Kong library at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University were also named in his honour. There is also a Sir Yue- Kong Pao Hall in Chinese International School in Hong Kong.

Its counterpart on the Bulgarian side is Kapitan Andreevo. Together, they form the busiest land border crossing point in Europe. Kapƒ±kule, situated on the State road D100 (D.100) and European route E80, is also an important gateway for cargo transport to the countries east of Turkey. The Asian Highway Network route AH1 terminates at the border. Other land border checkpoints in western Turkey are the neighboring Hamzabeyli (on the D.535) and Derek√∂y (on the D.555) to Bulgaria and ƒ∞psala (on the D.110, E84) to Greece. The Kapƒ±kule railway station, built in 1971, is located to the north of the town and handles more traffic than any other railway border crossing in Turkey. In the dawn of the Revolutions of 1989, the Kapƒ±kule border crossing saw a mass exodus of Turks fleeing the forced assimilation laws of the mid to late 1980s in the People's Republic of Bulgaria into Turkey.  Border checkpoint facilities  Around 400.000 vehicles and 4 million people cross annually the border in Kapƒ±kule that makes 35% of all the vehicle and 42% of all the passenger traffic passing through the land borders of Turkey. To meet the demand resulting from growing international crossings, the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) signed an agreement with the government in August 2007 to completely overhaul the facilities on Build-Operate-Transfer basis at a cost of 132 million TRL (US$100 million in 2007) in exchange for twenty-year operation. When reopened in the beginning of 2009, there will be 13 passenger car and 5 truck gates for inbound, and 7 passenger car and 6 truck gates for outbound traffic. High tech security equipment like smart-card controlled access, closed-circuit television and x-ray truck cargo check systems are installed at the border area. Also commercial services are provided by fast- food restaurants, duty-free shops, outlet stores, supermarkets and banks.

Clusters are considered to increase the productivity with which companies can compete, nationally and globally. Accounting is a part of the business cluster.JANU≈†KA, M. Communication as a key factor in Virtual Enterprise paradigm support. In Innovation and Knowledge Management: A Global Competitive Advantage. Kuala Lumpur: International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA), 2011. s. 1-9. In urban studies, the term agglomeration is used.Porter, M. E. 1998, Clusters and the new economics of competition, Harvard Business Review, Nov/Dec98, Vol. 76 Issue 6, p77, Clusters are also important aspects of strategic management.  Concept  The term business cluster, also known as an industry cluster, competitive cluster, or Porterian cluster, was introduced and popularized by Michael Porter in The Competitive Advantage of Nations (1990).Porter, M.E. (1990). The Competitive Advantage of Nations. New York: The Free Press. 1‚Äì857 pgs. The importance of economic geography, or more correctly geographical economics, was also brought to attention by Paul Krugman in Geography and Trade (1991).Krugman, P. (1991). Geography and Trade. MIT Press. 1-142pg. Cluster development has since become a focus for many government programs. The underlying concept, which economists have referred to as agglomeration economies, dates back to 1890, and the work of Alfred Marshall. Michael Porter claims that clusters have the potential to affect competition in three ways: by increasing the productivity of the companies in the cluster, by driving innovation in the field, and by stimulating new businesses in the field. According to Porter, in the modern global economy, comparative advantage‚Äîhow certain locations have special endowments (i.e., harbor, cheap labor) to overcome heavy input costs‚Äîis less relevant. Now, competitive advantage‚Äîhow companies make productive use of inputs, requiring continual innovation‚Äîis more important. Porter argues that economic activities are embedded in social activities; that 'social glue binds clusters together'. This is supported by recent research showing that particularly in regional and rural areas, significantly more innovation takes place in communities which have stronger inter-personal networks. Put in another way, a business cluster is a geographical location where enough resources and competences amass reach a critical threshold, giving it a key position in a given economic branch of activity, and with a decisive sustainable competitive advantage over other places, or even a world supremacy in that field (e.g. Silicon Valley and Hollywood). A cluster is most of the time the result of initiatives, since it implies to convince current competitors to work jointly. The initiative usually comes from the political sphere (e.g. the different Singaporian clusters Porter, M. E., Neo, B. S., & Ketels, C. H. (2010). Remaking Singapore.), but it can also come from the industry itself (e.g. the initiative of Bart J. Groot, the director of Dow Olefinverbund GmbH, a major chemicals complex at the intersection of three Eastearn Germany states (Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia after the reunification. The goal was to \\"encourage coordination among political and administrative officials\\" of Mitteldeutschland.)  Types = By composition  Following development of the concept of interorganizational networks in Germany and practical development of clusters in the United Kingdom; many perceive there to be four methods by which a cluster can be identified: * Geographical cluster ‚Äì as stated above e.g. the California wine clusterPorter, M. E., & Bond, G. C. (2004). The California wine cluster. Boston, MA: Harvard Business School. or the flower cluster between Rotterdam and Amsterdam in the Netherlands.Porter, M., Ramirez-Vallejo, J., & van Eenennaam, F. (2011). The Dutch flower cluster. * Sectoral clusters (a cluster of businesses operating together from within the same commercial sector e.g. marine (south east England; Cowes and now Solent) and photonics (Aston Science Park, Birmingham)) * Horizontal cluster (interconnections between businesses at a sharing of resources level e.g. knowledge management) * Vertical cluster (i.e. a supply chain cluster) It is also expected ‚Äì particularly in the German model of organizational networks ‚Äì that interconnected businesses must interact and have firm actions within at least two separate levels of the organizations concerned.  By type of comparative advantage  Several types of business clusters, based on different kinds of knowledge, are recognized: * High-tech clusters ‚Äì These clusters are high technology-oriented, well adapted to the knowledge economy, and typically have as a core renowned universities and research centers like Silicon Valley,Saxenian, A., 1994. Regional Advantage. Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128. Harvard University Press. the East London Tech City or Paris-Saclay. An exceptional example of a prominent high-tech cluster that does not include a university is the High Tech Campus Eindhoven, located in the Dutch city of Eindhoven. * Historic know-how-based clusters ‚Äì These are based on more traditional economic activities that maintain their advantage in know-how over the years, and for some of them, over many centuries. They are often industry-specific. An example is London as financial center. * Factor endowment clusters ‚Äì They are created because a comparative advantage they might have linked to a geographical position. For example, wine production clusters because of sunny regions surrounded by mountains, where good grapes can grow. This is like certain areas in France such as Burgundy and Champagne, as well as Lombardy, Spain, Chile and California. * Low-cost manufacturing clusters ‚Äì These clusters have typically emerged in developing countries within particular industries, such as automotive production, electronics, or textiles. Examples include electronics clusters in Mexico (e.g. Guadalajara) and Argentina (e.g. C√≥rdoba). Cluster firms typically serve clients in developed countries. Drivers of cluster emergence include availability of low-cost labor, geographical proximity to clients (e.g. in the case of Mexico for U.S. clients; Eastern Europe for Western European clients). * Knowledge services clusters ‚Äì Like low-cost manufacturing clusters, these clusters have emerged typically in developing countries. They have been characterized by the availability of lower-cost skills and expertise serving a growing global demand for increasingly commoditized (i.e. standardized, less firm-specific) knowledge services, e.g. software development, engineering support, analytical services. Examples include Bangalore, India; Recife, Brazil; Shanghai, China. Multinational corporations have played an important role in \\"customizing\\" business conditions in these clusters. One example for this is the establishment of collaborative linkages with local universities to secure the supply of qualified, yet lower-cost engineers.  Process  The process of identifying, defining, and describing a cluster is not standardized. Individual economic consultants and researchers develop their own methodologies. All cluster analysis relies on evaluation of local and regional employment patterns, based on industrial categorizations such as NAICS or the increasingly obsolete SIC codes. Notable databases providing statistical data on clusters and industry agglomeration include: * The Cluster Mapping Project (for the USA), conducted by the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School * The European Cluster Observatory (for Europe), managed by the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness at the Stockholm School of Economics An alternative to clusters, reflecting the distributed nature of business operations in the wake of globalization, is hubs and nodes.  The Silicon Valley case  In the mid- to late 1990s several successful computer technology related companies emerged in Silicon Valley in California. This led anyone who wished to create a startup company to do so in Silicon Valley. The surge in the number of Silicon Valley startups led to a number of venture capital firms relocating to or expanding their Valley offices. This in turn encouraged more entrepreneurs to locate their startups there. In other words, venture capitalists (sellers of finance) and dot-com startups (buyers of finance) \\"clustered\\" in and around a geographical area. The cluster effect in the capital market also led to a cluster effect in the labor market. As an increasing number of companies started up in Silicon Valley, programmers, engineers etc. realized that they would find greater job opportunities by moving to Silicon Valley. This concentration of technically skilled people in the valley meant that startups around the country knew that their chances of finding job candidates with the proper skill-sets were higher in the valley, hence giving them added incentive to move there. This in turn led to more high-tech workers moving there. Similar effects have also been found in the Cambridge IT Cluster (UK).  The Digital Media City case  In the late 1990s, the Seoul Metropolitan Government in South Korea developed the Digital Media City (DMC), a 135-acre complex, four miles outside of the city's central business district in the Sangam-dong district. With Seoul's rapidly growing cluster of multi-media, IT, and entertainment industries, the Digital Media City, through its vibrant agglomeration, helped to promote these industries and companies whose core business required use of information, communication, and media technologies. DMC grew and prospered as a global business environment, raising Seoul as an east-Asian hub of commerce. The cluster of its digital media-related, high-tech firms spawned partnerships which in turn leveraged both human and social capital in the area. Eventually, DMC fed the innovation of more than 10,000 small-scale Internet, game, and telecommunication firms located in Seoul. In development of DMC, the Seoul government leveraged initial funding by private technology partners and developers. It is also provided IT broadband and wireless networks to the area as well as needed infrastructure. The Seoul government even provided tax incentives and favorable land prices for magnet tenants who would attract other firms to the area due to established business relationships and through their presence which would in turn promote DMC as a prime location. With such a concentration of these entities, Seoul has become a major nexus of high- technology and digital media. It is home to digital media R&D; firms across a range of types including cultural media creation, digital media technologies, digital broadcasting centers, technology offices, and entertainment firms. Just outside the DMC complex include international firm affiliates, schools, moderate to low income housing, commercial and convention facilities, entertainment zones, and the city's central rail station. The cohesive connection of industry, cultural centers, infrastructure, and human capital has fostered Seoul as a strong metropolitan economy and South Korea, the Miracle on the Han River, as a storied nation transitioning from a manufacturing to an innovation economy.  Cluster effect  The cluster effect can be more easily perceived in any urban agglomeration, as most kinds of commercial establishments will tend to spontaneously group themselves by category. Shoe shops (or cloth shops), for instance, are rarely isolated from their competition. In fact, it is common to find whole streets of them. The cluster effect is similar to (but not the same as) the network effect. It is similar in the sense that the price-independent preferences of both the market and its participants are based on each one's perception of the other rather than the market simply being the sum of all its participants actions as is usually the case. Thus, by being an effect greater than the sum of its causes, and as it occurs spontaneously, the cluster effect is a usually cited example of emergence. Governments and companies often try to use the cluster effect to promote a particular place as good for a certain type of business. For example, the city of Bangalore, India has utilized the cluster effect in order to convince a number of high-tech companies to set up shop there. Similarly, Las Vegas has benefited through the cluster effect of the gambling industry. In France, the national industrial policy includes support for a specific form of business clusters, called \\"P√¥les de Comp√©titivit√©\\", such as Cap Digital. Another good example is the Nano/Microelectronics and Embedded Systems\\" or in short \\"mi-Cluster\\" that was facilitated by \\"Corallia Cluster Initiative\\" in Greece. Corallia introduced a bottom-up, 3-phase programme framework for facilitating cluster development, and was short-listed among the final classification (finalists) for the DG REGIO's RegioStars 2009 Awards in the category \\"Research, Technological Development and Innovation\\". Clusters, were proved to boost the innovative activity among firms of the same industry. One of the main causes that might be highlighted is the competition between the companies. Moreover, except of stimulating a favorable conditions for the exchange of ideas, industry-specific regional concentrations, also create a thick labor market input. Hence innovations increase the accumulation of the knowledge in the region which influences on the local internal economies. The cluster effect does not continue forever though. To sustain cluster performance in the long term, clusters need to manage network openness to business outside the cluster while facilitating strong inter-organisational relationships within the cluster. Its relative influence is also dictated by other market factors such as expected revenue, strength of demand, taxes, competition and politics. In the case of Silicon Valley as stated above for example, increased crowding in the valley led to severe shortage of office and residential space which in turn forced many companies to move to alternative locations such as Austin, Texas and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina even though they would have liked to stay in the valley. Sometimes cluster strategies still do not produce enough of a positive impact to be justified in certain industries. For instance, in the case of Builders Square, the home improvement retailer could not compete with industry leaders such as Home Depot when it could not materialize the same low costs and contracts. As a result, it was presented with an option to form a merger with another home improvement retailer, Hechinger to better improve their business clusters and compete with Home Depot and other industry leaders. However, when it failed to do so, it slowly began to fail and eventually fell into bankruptcy. Although the merger attempted to create geographic clusters to compete with the low costs of other firms, costs were not lowered enough and eventually the plan failed, forcing Hechinger into Chapter 7 liquidation and Builders Square out of the industry.

Malinen is currently managing the Finnish under-21 national team. Career=Managerial Malinen was coming to the end of his short career as a football player in 1978 when he decided to enroll as a student at the University of Oulu Department of Education. He started his career as a teacher just before he would have graduated, and thus didn't complete his studies. While working as a teacher he found himself yearning for a job where he could see more concretely the impact of his work. He soon became interested in football coaching. In 1986 Malinen found a job at Kastelli Sports Gymnasium (secondary education) as the school's football coach. Among his students at Kastelli were Antti Niemi and Mika Nurmela who went on to become Finnish internationals. Ville Nylund and Aarno Turpeinen, who later became core players of top team in Finland, HJK Helsinki, were also at Kastelli. Besides coaching at Kastelli, Malinen taught sports and crafts at a nearby school for hearing-impaired persons. The Kastelli football team was unexpectedly successful in 1989 when it qualified for the School World Championships 1989, held in Florence, Italy. Malinen's \\"brickwall\\" -tactic was a good match with inexperienced Finns, which didn't lose any games, but were still knocked out in second stage by France (Auxerre academy) with penalties. France became the champions and Kastelli finished in 5th place. It was this tournament, where Malinen first gained reputation and proved to himself that he could lead a successful career as a football manager. After Kastelli, Malinen was hired as a manager of Rauman Pallo. During his time at Rauma, he became full-time football manager. Two players from Kastelli, Antti Niemi and Mika Nurmela followed Malinen to Rauman Pallo. =U15 and U16 National teams= In summer 1990 Malinen was made U15 and U16 national team manager by Finnish FA. He led his team in 1991 and 1992 European Championships. After about four years of coaching the national teams Malinen wanted to get back into more rapid life of club football. =Shows promise in Premier League= He returned to his hometown Oulu and FC Oulu, which did get promoted next year. Besides being promoted, the club was hampered by financial difficulties, so Malinen went to TPS. With surprising Finnish Cup win in 1994 and bronze medal in 1996 Malinen stepped at TPS into the limelight as one of the most promising managers in Finnish Premier League. =MyPa= In 1998 Malinen moved from the former capital of Finland to the opposite side of Finland, to MyPa and small town of Anjalankoski. Backed by the strong local forest industry magnates, Malinen was given quite free hands at combining his team. This was the first time when he had some leverage - even the TPS, one of the biggest Finnish clubs, was cash-strapped. Malinen's time at MyPa was somewhat successful (4 medals but only limited UEFA Cup success). MyPa's current manager Ilkka M√§kel√§ came on board during those times as an assistant manager. =KuPS= In 2004, Malinen took over as manager of KuPS, one of Finland's most traditional and successful clubs, who had just been relegated to the Ykk√∂nen. Malinen revamped the team, bringing in experienced players from MyPa, revamping the youth system and overseeing the construction of a new stadium. KuPS won the 2004 Ykk√∂nen, returning to the Veikkausliiga at their first attempt. With emerging talents such as Berat Sadik, Pyry K√§rkk√§inen, Medo and Patrick Bantamoi, KuPS won their first Finnish League Cup in 2006, but ended the year with relegation, which saw the departure of Malinen. =Shakhter Karagandy= In February 2007, Malinen was appointed as manager of Kazakhstan Premier League side Shakhter Karagandy and the Kazakhstan U-21 Team. Malinen left Shakhter Karagandy after just 7 months, but remained as the Kazakhstan U-21 manager until the end of 2007.\\"Football newsbriefs\\". National Broadcasting Agency (YLE) text-tv, 2 August 2007. Retrieved 2007-7-2. =Racism controversy= On taking over as coach of RoPS in April 2014, Malinen courted controversy with his comments about foreign players, especially coloured players, in the team. Malinen had told newspaper Iltalehti: \\"We have the league's most Finnish team. ... Just a few years back RoPS had 13 black men. We've managed to put that completely behind us. We've recruited players with names that get pronounced correctly and the Finns know them.\\" Weighing up the negative press Malinen later replied: \\"I get along with all nationalities.\\"\\"Said & Done\\", The Guardian, 13.4.2014.\\"Meill√§ on liigan suomalaisin joukkue\\" (\\"We have the league's most Finnish team\\"), Iltalehti, 6.4.2014.

This is usually distinct from actually playing and analyzing games of chess. Many chess playing programs also have provision for solving some kinds of problem such as checkmate in a certain number of moves (directmates), and some also have support for helpmates and selfmates. Software for chess problems can be used for creating and solving problems, including checking the soundness of a concept and position, storing it in a database, printing and publishing, and saving and exporting the problem. As such they can not only solve direct mates, helpmates and selfmates, but at times even problems with fairy pieces and other fairy chess problems. There have also been some attempts to have computers \\"compose\\" problems, largely autonomously. Software=Alybadix First developed in 1980 by Ilkka Blom, Alybadix is a suite of chess problem solving programs for DOS and Commodore 64. Alybadix supports solving classical problems: selfmates, reflex mates, series mates, Circe, maximummers, and many Fairy types. It comes with a large problem collection and supports quality printing.Alybadix official website In 1993, Schach und Spiele magazine considered Alybadix to be six times faster than other playing machines including the RISC 2500. Popeye Popeye is a chess problem- solving software accommodating many fairy chess rules and able to investigate set play and tries. It can be used with several operating systems and can be connected to several existing graphical interfaces since it comes with freely available source code, cf. . Since its origin, Popeye was designed as a general-purpose, extensible tool for checking fairy and heterodox chess problems. The original author of Popeye was Philippe Schnoebelen who wrote it in Pascal under MS-DOS around 1983-84. In 1986 the code was donated in the spirit of the free software movement. Elmar Bartel, Norbert Geissler, Thomas Maeder, Torsten Linss, Stefan Hoening, Stefan Brunzen, Harald Denker, Thomas Bark and Stephen Emmerson, converted Popeye to the C programming language, and now maintain the program. A good graphic interface \\"AP WIN\\" a freeware, for using with Windows XP or Windows 7 has since been developed by Paul H. Wiereyn. Using this one can create diagrams and use Popeye for solving problems directly from the diagram. Chloe and Winchloe Chloe (DOS) and Winchloe (proprietary software) are solving programs written by Christian Poisson. Winchloe not only supports classical problems ‚Äî direct mates, helpmates and selfmates ‚Äî but also many fairy pieces and conditions with different sized chessboards (up to 250 by 250 squares). It comes with a collection of more than 300,000 problems that can be updated via the Internet. Christian Poisson also maintains the Web site Problemesis. Natch and iNatch Natch and iNatch are freeware programs written by Pascal Wassong for DOS and Linux.http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/softeng.htm Natch solves retrograde analysis problems by constructing a \\"proof game\\" - the shortest possible game leading to a certain position. Natch is a command line utility, but there is a Java based graphical interface. iNatch also provides moves with fairy conditions: monochrome chess, Einstein chess, vertical cylinder. Problemist(e) Problemist is a shareware program written by Matthieu Leschamelle for Windows and Windows Mobile. Problemist solves direct mates, helpmates, selfmates and reflexmates. It can rotate positions, print diagrams and much more. With Problemist come two TrueType chess fonts, and from its web page one can download more than 100,000 problems. Problemist is the first chess problems exchange format. Jacobi Jacobi is a program to solve fairy chess proof game problems by Fran√ßois Labelle. It is written in JavaScript and run from browser . In 2003, Labelle already developed chess- related programs and published computer-generated chess problems . Chest Chest was created by Heiner Marxen in 1999.

He was born in K√∂rchow, Mecklenburg-Schwerin on 18 January 1810 and he died in Schwerin on 26 January 1895. Life He was educated at the gymnasium of Schwerin, and at the Universities of Berlin and Rostock. In 1833 he was appointed instructor of Duke William of Mecklenburg, and in 1837 accompanied Grand Duke Frederick Francis as tutor to Dresden. He became pastor at Ludwigslust in 1840, and superintendent of Schwerin in 1844. Since 1835 he had been the leading spirit in the ecclesiastical and theological affairs of his state. With the abolishment of the old constitution of the estates in 1848 and the organization of a parliamentary government, the rule of the Church by the State had become an impossibility. Thus there originated in 1850 a superior ecclesiastical court with Kliefoth as chief ecclesiastical councilor. In 1886, he became its president. During the decades 1850-70, he was actively engaged in ecclesiastical reforms. Being convinced that the prosperity of the Church is principally dependent upon the efficiency of the administrators of the Means of Grace, he was intent upon filling the clergy with the spirit and doctrines of the Lutheran Church. To this end the faculty of Rostock was reorganized with teachers of strictly Lutheran tendency, the institution of church inspections by superintendents was again called into life, abuses in the church service and in the administration of ecclesiastical acts were abolished, and the rationalistic spirit was removed from the pulpit. New formularies of liturgy on the basis of the old church orders were made, and the old treasures of Lutheran church music were embodied in a new book of melodies. His Views of the Church and Church Polity Kliefoth laid down his conception of the Church and church polity in his Acht B√ºcher von der Kirche (vol. i., Schwerin, 1854). The first four books treat of the kingdom of God founding of the Church, of the means of grace, of the congregation and its service, and of the Church and its order and government. The last four books, which were to treat of the development and completion of the Church never appeared. Kliefoth's peculiar conception was due chiefly to his occupation with the old Lutheran church orders. With great energy he emphasizes the divine foundation of the Church through the acts of salvation of the triune God; its divine basis in the Means of Grace, which mediate and vouchsafe the continuous effect of Christ and his spirit; the divine institution of the office of the means of grace; and the necessity of the organization and incorporation of the Church in church order and church government. The Church is for him the empirical congregation of the called, and not merely the congregation of true believers; and for him Lutheranism is not merely a doctrine or dogmatical tendency, but a distinctive church body whose peculiar historical development is to be perpetuated. He opposed the territorialism of state omnipotence, which denied the independence of the Church, the collegialism of modern representative church government, which originated in the Reformed Church and seemed to him to endanger the privilege and authority of the office of the means of grace; unionism, which threatened to absorb the Lutheran Church as such, or at least its confession; and the amalgamation of Church and politics, with its tendency toward the establishment of a national German Evangelical Church. On the other hand, he aimed at the restoration of the Lutheran state churches and the strengthening of Lutheranism through a closer union. In this sense he represented the government of the Mecklenburg church at the Eisenach Conference after 1852; and in 1868 he founded with others the Allgemeine evangelisch-lutherische Konferenz. Kliefoth was one of the strongest men among the churchmen and theologians of his day, and one of the most effective preachers of the nineteenth century. The political and ecclesiastical liberals decried him as a dangerous reactionist, the unionists hated his strict Lutheranism, the representatives of pietistic subjectivism were offended by his ecclesiasticism, and popular sentiment disliked his hierarchical tendencies. He was also the most notable authority of his time on liturgies and the old Lutheran church orders. His Liturgische Abhandlungen (8 vols., Schwerin, 1854‚Äì61, 2d. ed., 1858‚Äì69) is his most prominent work, the most peculiar expression of his spirit. Other important works are: Einleitung in die Dogmengeschichte (Ludwigslust, 1839); Theorie des Kultus der evangelischen Kirche (1844); Ueber Predigt und Katechese in der Vergangenheit und in der Gegenwart (in Mecklenburgisches Kirchenblatt, ii.1-55, 169-245, Rostock, 1846); Die urspr√ºngliche Gottesdienst-ordnung in den deutschen Kirchen lutherischen Bekenntnisses (Rostock, 1847); Das Verh√§ltnis der Landesherren als Inhaber der Kirchengewalt zu ihren Kirchenbeh√∂rden (Schwerin, 1861); Der preussische Staat und die Kirchen (1873); and Christliche Eschatologie (Leipzig, 1886). He also wrote commentaries on Zechariah (Schwerin, 1859), Ezekiel (2 parts, Rostock, 1864‚Äì65), Daniel (Schwerin, 1868), and Revelation (Leipsic, 1874). With Prof. O. Mejer of Rostock he edited the Kirchliche Zeitschrift (Schwerin, 1854‚Äì59), which, with A. W. Dieckhoff, he continued as Theologische Zeitschrift (1860‚Äì64). He published several collections of sermons, and a great number of single and occasional sermons. References * Secondary Literature English Conser, Jr., Walter H.

Houghton It was active from September 2004 to March 2008 and is now defunct, but the group profiles that were included in the knowledge base are now hosted by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. The TKB was sponsored by the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT), a non-profit organization funded by the United States Department of Homeland Security. The TKB contained historical information on terrorism dating back to 1968, with over 29,000 incident profiles, 900 group profiles, and 1,200 leader biographies. The TKB contained several features to analyze terrorism data, including graphing tools, interactive maps, and statistical summaries.  Incident databases  The TKB contains two separate terrorist incident databases, the RAND Terrorism Chronology 1968‚Äì1997 and the RAND Terrorism Incident database (1998‚ÄìPresent). While the former component tracked international incidents, the latter database includes both domestic and international attacks. The RAND Corporation is a global think tank founded in 1946 by the United States armed forces.  Group and leader profiles  In addition to incident databases, the TKB contains information on several hundred terrorist groups and leaders. DFI International, a consulting firm based in Washington DC, is responsible for these group and leader profiles. Group profiles include information about group ideology, founding philosophy, current goals, as well as basic ‚Äúquick facts‚Äù such as member strength and funding sources. Leader profiles contain information about the membership and role of key terrorist leaders, as well as the individual‚Äôs history and current whereabouts.  Legal database and documents  The TKB also contains several hundred case profiles from the American Terrorism Study. Directed by Dr. Brent Smith (University of Arkansas) and Dr. Kelly Damphousse, the ATS is a database of individuals and groups indicted by the United States government as the result of an official FBI terrorism investigation. Case profiles contain a synopsis of the indictment as well as scanned copies of public record documents relating to the court proceedings.  Other tools  The TKB also includes an interactive map with satellite imagery and overlay capabilities, allowing users to plot terrorist incidents as well as key infrastructure such as roads, pipelines, and natural resources. Other features include a graphing program known as the \\"incident analysis wizard,\\" interactive tables, an advanced search tool, and terrorism related news items.

He was known as \\"Shufflin' Phil\\", most likely because of his slow gait from the bullpen to the mound. Douglas originally signed with the Chicago White Sox in 1912, but soon landed with the Cincinnati Reds. In 1915, he was traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers, then to the Chicago Cubs. Douglas' short stints with these and future teams stemmed from their frustrations with his well-documented alcoholism, about which a contemporary journalist wrote, \\"Drinking was not a habit with Douglas‚Äîit was a disease.\\" Douglas in 1922 His throwing error on a sacrifice bunt in Game 4 of the 1918 World Series gave the Boston Red Sox a 3-2 victory over the Cubs. In 1919, he was signed by the New York Giants. John McGraw had some luck in keeping Douglas' drinking under control. In 1920, Douglas had a 14‚Äì10 record and a 2.71 ERA. Following the season, the spitball was banned but 17 players, including Douglas, were allowed to continue using the pitch. Douglas' best year was in 1921, when he won 15 games in the regular season with an ERA of 2.08. He then won two games in the 1921 World Series to help the Giants win the series. In 1922, he had 11 wins and a league-leading 2.63 ERA, but was suspended after a quarrel with McGraw and fined $100. Shortly after he was suspended and while intoxicated, Douglas sent the following letter to Les Mann of the St. Louis Cardinals: > I want to leave here but I want some inducement. I don't want this guy to > win the pennant and I feel if I stay here I will win it for him. If you want > to send a man over here with the goods, I will leave for home on next train. > I will go down to fishing camp and stay there. The letter found its way to Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Landis banned Douglas from baseball for life. On August 1, 1952, Douglas died in Sequatchie, Tennessee, and was buried in Tracy City, Tennessee.

Founded in 1880 as the Indian University by Almon C. Bacone, Bacone College is the oldest continuously operated institution of higher education in Oklahoma. The college has strong historic ties to several tribal nations, including the Muscogee (Creek) Nation and the Cherokees, and also to the American Baptist Churches USA. Bacone College is a member of the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the Oklahoma Independent College Foundation and Universities, the Joint Review Commission for Radiography Education, the National League for Nursing, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, and an affiliate member of the Oklahoma Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. Its current president is Dr. Ferlin Clark, a citizen of the Navajo (Dine) Nation and graduate of University of Arizona. History Rockefeller Hall, ca. 1910 The college traces its origins to a request to the American Baptist Home Mission Society by Professor Almon C. Bacone, a missionary teacher, to start a school in the Cherokee Baptist Mission at Tahlequah, Indian Territory. Bacone had previously taught at the Cherokee Male Seminary established in Indian Territory.Thornton, Russell, ed. Studying Native America: Problems and Prospects. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1999: 84. (retrieved through Google Books, 30 August 2009) . According to writer John Bartlett Meserve, Bacone College had its origins in a Baptist Mission school at Valley Town in North Carolina. That school became noted because of the work of Evan Jones, one of the earliest missionaries to the Cherokee. After most of the Cherokee were removed to Indian Territory, the Valley Town school moved to a site near what developed as the present town of Westville. In 1867, Evan Jones' son, John B. Jones, moved the school to Talequah. The mission school moved to Muskogee in 1885 and changed its name to Bacone.Meserve, John Bartlett. \\"Chief Lewis Downing and Chief Charles Thompson (Oochalata). In: Chronicles of Oklahoma> Volume 16, Number 3. September 1938. Retrieved July 19, 2013. When he started Bacone College, Professor Bacone, the sole faculty, enrolled three students. By the end of the first semester, there were 12. By the end of the first year, the student population was 56 and the faculty numbered three. Seeing the need to expand, he appealed to the Muscogee Creek Nation's Tribal Council for of land in nearby Muskogee, known then as the \\"Indian Capital of the World\\". The land was granted, and in 1885 Indian University was moved to its present site. In 1910, it was renamed Bacone Indian University after its founder and first president. The Board of Trustees later changed the name to the current Bacone College, as it emphasizes undergraduate education. Almon C. Bacone The campus contains many reminders of Bacone's history, tradition, and goals. One of these is a small cemetery, where Bacone presidents Almon C. Bacone (1880‚Äì1896) and Benjamin D. Weeks (1918‚Äì1941) were buried, as well as others associated with the school over the years. On the west side of the campus is a stone pulpit marking the spot where Bacone, Joseph Samuel Murrow and Daniel Rogers, two Baptist missionaries who were also trustees of Indian University, knelt in prayer to dedicate the land received from the Creek to the Christian education of American Indians. In the spring of 2018 the college experienced severe financial stress, firing most employees following commencement and publicly reporting that the college needed $2 million to complete the 2018-2019 academic year and open in the fall of 2019. However, the school reopened after cutting programs, reducing faculty and selling property. The college developed a plan to form a consortium of Oklahoma tribes to transition back to its roots as a tribal college, which would both give tribal governments ownership in the education of their students, and provide stable funding from the federal government in fulfillment of its trust responsibilities to educate American Indian students. The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma approved a charter agreement in April 2019, and in July 2019, the Osage Nation announced that it would charter the school as a tribal college. The school got its third charter in August 2019 from the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, its fourth In September 2019 from the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, and its fifth in February 2020 from the Kiowa Tribe. (The Muscogee (Creek) Nation, while originally chartering the school in the late 19th Century, has not done so this time because the tribe recently chartered its own separate college, the College of the Muscogee Nation.) Campus Ataloa Lodge, art museum on campus One of the first buildings to be erected was Rockefeller Hall, a three-story building made possible by a $10,000 contribution from John D. Rockefeller. \\"Old Rock,\\" as it came to be called, served as classroom, dormitory, dining hall, chapel, teacher quarters and administration building. It was razed in 1938 and a Memorial Chapel was built in its place. That was destroyed by fire but rebuilt in the 1990s. The historic buildings of the campus were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The campus contains many other reminders of Bacone's history, tradition, and goals. One of these is a small cemetery, the final resting place of Bacone presidents Almon C. Bacone (1880‚Äì1896) and Benjamin D. Weeks (1918‚Äì1941), as well as others associated with the school. A \\"stone bible\\" sculpture marks the spot on which President Bacone and Joseph Samuel Murrow and Daniel Rogers, two Baptist missionaries and trustees, knelt in prayer to dedicate the college. The names of all the college's presidents are inscribed on its surface. Other structures on campus include The Indian Room at the Bacone College Library, which is the home of many of Almon C. Bacone original papers; the Ataloa Lodge Museum, which has an impressive Native American art collection; and the McCombs Gallery, which features a large cross-section of Native American art. This includes artwork by alumnus, former director, and professor emeritus Richard \\"Dick\\" West (Cheyenne), an artist best known for his traditional Plains-style artwork, and Woody Crumbo, the only American Indian to receive the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship. Collectively, the traditional, flat-style painting movement developed by Blue Eagle, Crumbo, West, and others is known as the Bacone school. In 2011 Bacone acquired the Northpointe Shopping Center. Renamed the Bacone Commons, the college moved important offices there, including the Campus library. The site was sold for $2.85 million as part of the College's 2018-2019 financial restructuring. Centers Bacone College has three centers associated with the institution to help full fill the historical mission of the college. Center for American Indians: * Preservation of the American Indian Collections at Bacone College. * Coordination of American Indian degrees and cultural programs. * Research related to the future of American Indian education and collections in higher education. Center for Christian Ministry: *The broad umbrella for spiritual life on campus that helps the College to fulfill its mission as a four-year liberal arts college affiliated with the American Baptist Churches. Center for Church Relations: *As the churches support the college with students and scholarships, the center serves the churches by sending new leaders into the harvest field, providing training to non- traditional learners through online and off-campus education, assisting churches in their growth, providing music and preaching/teaching ministry to the churches for special events, and continuing education for church leaders. Athletics Bacone College teams, nicknamed athletically as the Warriors, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing independent of a conference affiliation. Until 2019, the college competed in the Sooner Athletic Conference (SAC), while its football team competed in the Central States Football League (CSFL) until the sport was discontinued in 2018. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer and track and field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track and field and volleyball. Bacone Baseball won the Junior College World Series in 1967; a school with total enrollment of 250 competed with schools that had over 20,000. They were led by coach Enos Semore, who went on to coach at Oklahoma for 23 years. In 2018 Bacone dropped the football, volleyball, golf and rodeo teams. As of February 2020, the college has men's and women's basketball, softball, baseball, men's and women's soccer and men's and women's cross country teams.

During his playing career he represented Wolverhampton Wanderers and Northern Ireland at international level. His career was cut short by persistent injuries aged 24 but later made a successful return to football with Worcester City, earning a contract after a successful trial. He finished his career at Bridgnorth Town where he began his managerial career. Playing career=Wolverhampton Wanderers Clyde was a product of Wolves' academy, and came into contention for a first-team spot in the 2002‚Äì03 season. He was initially loaned out to Kidderminster Harriers, then in League Two, where he made four appearances. He made his league debut there on 14 September 2002 in a 1-1 draw at Scunthorpe United. He returned to Molineux after this brief spell and quickly found a place in the first team, ahead of team captain Paul Butler. He made 17 league appearances for the club in this debut season, which saw Wolves win promotion via the play-offs. Clyde himself missed the conclusion of the campaign though as he suffered a knee injury which was later operated on. The defender recovered sufficiently to feature in Wolves' Premier League season of 2003‚Äì04, playing in nine top-flight games, which earned him a 4-year contract extension in July 2004. After featuring in Wolves' opening 13 games back in the Championship, he suffered another injury blow when he turned his ankle while training with Northern Ireland. He recovered but found his season later halted for good when his knee troubles flared up again in February 2005. After missing the entire 2005‚Äì06 season, having struggled to recover from ankle surgery, he began Wolves' opening three games in 2006‚Äì07 under new manager Mick McCarthy. However, his injury problems quickly resurfaced and he was once again sidelined. On 8 February 2007, Clyde announced his immediate retirement from football, aged just 24, owing to his persistent injury battles. He is now working for Designer Drives and Landscapes ltd. along with Steve Leith and co. Later career Clyde made a return to football for the five-a-side team Bridgnorth 2000 in the JSR Construction Bridgnorth Five-a-Side League in 2007. Clyde signed for non-League Worcester City two years later and occupied a player-coach role under boss Carl Heeley. International career Clyde has represented Northern Ireland three times, making his debut on 8 September 2004 in a 2-2 World Cup qualifying draw in Wales. He has also been selected for their Under-18, U20 and U21 squads. Managerial career When Lee Mills left Bridgnorth Town in June 2011, Clyde moved there and replaced him as manager. In the summer of 2019 he replaced Sean Friars as manager of Limavady United in the NIFL Premier Intermediate League, the third tier of football in Northern Ireland.

He studied medicine at the Royal University of Malta and the University of Edinburgh,1890-95, where he graduated with an MB ChB, receiving a medal for his exceptional ability in anatomy. From his youth he had shown musical inclinations, and had wanted to study music, but his father did not approve, and consequently he continued his career in medicine, following in the footsteps of two elder brothers (Richard and Carmelo), who were already well known doctors. His eldest brother, Lt Col Achilles Samut, was in the Army Ordnance Corps and later became a Malta Senator 1921-29 and served in Sir Gerald Strickland's government 1927-29. Military career On his return to Malta from Edinburgh, he was appointed Professor of Physiology and Bacteriology at the Royal University of Malta. He was also nominated specialist of Pathology at the Central Civil Hospital in Floriana (a building which now houses the Island's Police HQ). In 1897 Prof. Robert Samut joined The King's Own Malta Regiment of Militia as Lieutenant Surgeon. He was promoted to Captain in 1900 and Major in 1909. Immediately following the earthquake at Messina in 1908, he rushed to the devastated city to give his help. His meritorious service was recognised by the King of Italy, who named him Cavaliere Ufficiale della Corona d‚ÄôItalia, and also by the award of the Red Cross Diploma. In 1915, during the First World War, he was posted with his regiment to Cyprus where he was given command of the Forest Military Hospital in Limassol. His work was highly acclaimed and was mentioned in various despatches and also received the General Service Medal. Medical career In 1915 he was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Pathology at the Royal University of Malta in addition to the two posts he already had. It was this position that eventually was to cause his death. He had been asked to carry out an autopsy on a woman who had died with a strange illness and for reasons that are not well understood, he was infected with her illness. Prof Robert Samut pioneered the first tests (although primitive) on certain sexually transmitted diseases on the Maltese Islands. Even though Prof. Robert Samut was busy with these positions, he still paid house calls to his patients. The period following the First World War, and even more so with the events that led the 1919 Sette Gugnio riots, many of the Floriana residents were poor and he would treat them for free. Maltese National Anthem While studying in Edinburgh he had once been asked to sing the Maltese Anthem, and the fact that Malta did not have one, induced him to do something about it. He wrote some simple notes, however the pressure of his work made him forget about them. Then one day in the early 1920s having been asked by Dr. Albert Laferla, his brother-in-law, the then Director of Elementary Schools, to compose a hymn for school children, he remembered his notes, and used them to compose the present hymn. Thus Samut became one of those who gave Malta its national identity. Dr. Laferla then took that music to the National Poet Dun Karm (Mgr. Karm Psaila, D.Litt. (Hon. Causa)), who wrote the verses. It is reported that Dun Karm had stated that this was not the usual practice, as normally music was composed to the verses and not vice versa. Nevertheless, a beautiful prayer to God from the Maltese people saw the light of day. The hymn was subsequently donated to the people of Malta. Later years In 1922 Samut was promoted to Lt. Colonel, but by now he was feeling the effects of the virus he contracted from the autopsy and his health was failing. He became an invalid and suffered his sickness till his death. In the meantime the ball that he had started rolling was gathering momentum. On Saturday, 3 February 1923, the \\"Innu Malti\\" was played for the first time in public during a concert at the Manoel Theatre. For a number of years the \\"Innu\\" was played only during 8 September celebrations. Then in 1936, the King's Own Band Club commissioned Mro. V. Ciappara to prepare a full score for the band, and played that hymn on 8 September of the same year. Other bands soon followed their example. In 1938 an English translation prepared by Miss M. Butcher appeared in the Times of Malta. Samut was not to see the growth of his music. He was taken to Australia with the hope that a long sea voyage might be of benefit to his health but it proved to be quite the contrary. Thus after only a short stay at that colony he returned to Malta and lived for a number of years in Sliema, with one of his daughters. He married Alice Laferla, great-granddaughter of Sir Agostino Portelli, and had six children. He died peacefully at the age of 64 years, just after noon, on 26 May 1934, and was buried in the Portelli Chapel at the Addolorata Cemetery. Legacy All the people of the Maltese Islands soon accepted the \\"Innu Malti\\" and it was customary that it be played on all occasions in conjunction with the \\"God Save the King\\". Later, when Malta obtained autonomy, the \\"Innu\\" was played for the Prime Minister. The 1964 Independence Constitution, Chapter One (The State), Section 4 states that the National Anthem of these islands is to be the \\"Innu Malti\\". This was also confirmed by the \\"Republic\\" constitution. Thus finally, the music, written with the passion of a patriot, a hymn made into a prayer by a national poet, was crowned with the highest glory. Eventually an Act of Parliament laid down the exact format of the music and how it should be played. All this heralded a new era to the historic Maltese Islands, an era for which the Maltese had been fighting for many centuries. History is built step by step, but surely one of the foundation stones of the future history of Malta is the music of Robert Samut. On 26 May 1968 Dr Giorgio Borƒ° Olivier, then Prime Minister of Independent Malta, in the presence of the Governor General and Lady Dorman, of His Grace Mgr Michael Gonzi, and many other personalities, unveiled a marble plaque on the fa√ßade of the Lion House to commemorate the birthplace of Prof. Samut. A leaflet, designed by the great artist Emvin Cremona was also printed for the occasion. Nearby, on Triq Sarria, the old Wesleyan Methodist Chapel has been refurbished and renamed as the Robert Samut Concert Hall in his honour.

He is considered one of Australia's finest footballers of the 20th century. Century's Top 100 Players Biography Kearney was born in Penrith, New South Wales. He joined Parramatta's 1st grade rugby union side from school before serving in the Royal Australian Air Force in World War II and represented Combined Services in rugby union. Rugby union career After discharge from the Air Force he resumed playing rugby union in Australia and d√©buted for the Wallabies against the All Blacks playing two Tests in June 1947 then went on the 1947‚Äì48 Australian rugby union tour of Europe and North America, playing against each of the five European rugby union nations. Rugby league career Kearney circa 1952 Kearney returned to England at the end of the Wallabies tour and switched to the professional code of rugby league. After three seasons with Leeds he returned to Australia in 1952 and joined St George. He was captain- coach between 1954‚Äì1955, and later between 1957‚Äì1961. At the end of his first club rugby league season back in Australia with St George, Kearney was selected for the 1952 Kangaroo tour. Kearney's international rugby league d√©but in Bradford on 13 December 1952 saw him become Australia's 24th dual code rugby international, following Len Smith, and preceding Rex Mossop. Kearney played in the 3rd Test against Great Britain, all three tests against France, and sixteen minor tour matches. He is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No.302.ARL Annual Report 2005 He went on the 1953 tour of New Zealand playing in all three Tests and the following year represented in the 1954 Rugby League World Cup, the first ever, in France. In 1956, the commencing year of the Dragons' record breaking run Norm Tipping had coached the team to an excellent season result of 15 wins, four losses and 1 draw but regardless would be ousted from the coaching job shortly after the grand final victory. He was the loser in a power struggle with Kearney, who led the side on-field and who that year had captained Australia to a three Test whitewash of New Zealand, had captained New South Wales to state victory over Queensland, won the Sunday Telegraph's Player of the Year award and ultimately captained St. George to premiership victory. The St George committee chose to back Kearney's fine football brain and his advanced strategies on attack, defense and conditioning in choosing him as their captain-coach to go forward. In the process they laid the foundation for the club's eleven-year premiership stranglehold. Following his premiership success with St George as both captain and coach, Kearney was selected as captain-coach of Australia for the 1956 trans-Tasman series against New Zealand with Clive Churchill unavailable due to injury. Australia won the series 3‚Äì0 to regain the trans-Tasman trophy that the Kiwis had held since 1935. Kearney stayed on a captain-coach for the 1956 Kangaroo tour in spite of the availability and tour selection of Churchill with whom he reportedly enjoyed an uneasy relationship. The touring side won all three Tests in France but lost against Great Britain 2‚Äì1. Kearney played in all Tests on tour. Kearney played in an exceptionally talented Australian side who won the 1957 World Cup under captain Dick Poole, playing out one of the matches with a broken jaw. and the 1958 domestic Ashes series under captain Brian Davies before retiring from international football. Kearney brought tactics and strategy from English rugby league and is often credited with masterminding the St. George Dragons successful run. He was able to inspire loyalty in his players by leading from the front and to develop a level of fitness and ruthless, mistake free football. This discipline was the foundation for the famous straight line brick-wall defence that kept the St George team at the top through those years. He played 156 games from 1952 to 1961, captained the club in five winning Grand Finals (as captain-coach for the latter four) and coached them to further victory in 1961. Post- playing After retiring as a player Kearney stayed on with St George as coach for the remainder of the 1961 NSWRFL season before resigning. He then coached the Parramatta Eels to the semi finals in 1962‚Äì1964. He coached the Western Suburbs Magpies club in 1965 and was the foundation coach for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in their first three seasons, 1967‚Äì1969.
