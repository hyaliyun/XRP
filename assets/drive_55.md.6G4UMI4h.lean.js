He was known for his contributions to American studies, including photography and Western art and illustrations. His two books in these fields were Photography and the American Scene (1938) and Artists and Illustrators of the Old West (1953). The historian Bernard DeVoto said of Taft: \\"For one man to produce two books so original and fundamental, so comprehensive, so authoritative, and I may add so delightfulsurely this is one of the most remarkable scholarly achievements in our time.\\" Taft's extensive papers, documenting the research he did in all fields, were donated by his children to the Kansas Historical Society. His personal papers, especially relating to his Mt. Oread books, are at the Kenneth Spencer Research Library, University of Kansas.  Personal life  Robert Taft was born on March 24, 1894, in Tokyo, Japan. For the first three years of his life, he remained in Japan, where his parents were serving as missionaries, but when he was three, his family moved to Rochester, New York. He earned an undergraduate degree in history at Grand Island College (1916) and a master's degree from the University of Iowa (1919). In 1925, he earned a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Kansas (KU); his doctoral dissertation was titled \\"Oxidation and Reduction\\". From 1919 until 1922, Taft lived and taught in Ottawa, Kansas before he was hired to teach at KU. In 1937, he was promoted to professor, a capacity in which he served, according to the Kenneth Spencer Research Library, until his demise in 1955.  Academic career  Taft's field was physical chemistry with a special interest in the electrodeposition of metals. He served as president of the Kansas Academy of Science from 1941 until his death and also served as editor of its publication, Transactions.  Mount Oread and Kansas history  The University of Kansas, in Lawrence, Kansas, is built upon a hill, locally known as Mt. Oread. Taft ascertained that the location had been a stop on the Oregon Trail. Based on this theory, he wrote, first, Across the Years at Mt. Oread in 1941, and then revised it as The Years at Mt. Oread, which was published in 1955. Taft also wrote various papers about the history of Kansas. During 1952 and 1953, he served as the president of the Kansas State Historical Society. The following year he served as chairman of the Kansas Territorial Centennial Commission.  Photography  Taft's book Photography and the American Scene: a Social History 18381889 was among the first books to cover the early years of photography in the United States. Taft's interest in the photography developed from his knowledge of chemistry and the mechanism of daguerreotypes, and this is evident in the book's detailed technical explanations of the science of photography. Taft also attributed his interest in this field (and American art more generally) to his early reading of an account of John C. Fremont's western explorations. In various chapters, the book details the science and art of daguerreotypes, tintypes, carte de visites, stereographs, and more modern developments. To write the book and make the careful analyses he did, Taft relied upon extensive research. All Taft's research was conducted in the old-fashioned way of writing letters to people and museums all over the country, reading old newspapers, and making visits to various document depositories around the country. All of this work appears as hundreds of footnotes in the book. In fact, more than half of the writing in the book is in the footnotes. Many of these notes describe Taft's process of obtaining photographs and associated documents; e.g., how he wrote to the widow or children of some photographer, and was able to obtain original letters or photos, which allowed him to make substantiated statements. Francois Brunet, Professor of Art and Literature of the United States at the Paris Diderot University, praised Taft's work as grass-roots historical research.  Early western art  Taft's Artists and Illustrators of the Old West, 18501900, published in 1953, was a significant contribution to research and knowledge on the subject. This book concentrated on those artists who traveled to an as-yet largely unsettled West to create observational drawings from life. The book is illustrated with works by the artists that Taft discusses. Being a scientist, he often explains the process by which an original drawing was reproduced. This is especially interesting when various publications after the Civil War, such as Harpers Weekly, had drawings transferred onto wood blocks for printing. Taft devotes chapters to little-known illustrators, such as Frenzeny, Tavenier, M√∂llhausen, and Zaugbaum, praising those artists who actually witnessed the scenes they portrayed, and presented it as accurately and in detail as possible. They should as well, he says, be competent draftsmen. Taft used the same techniques as in the photography bookdoing primary research, contacting relatives of the artists, tracing down pictures in out-of-the way libraries, and scanning old newspapers in western towns. And, once again, the footnotes exceed the text by volume. It is these notes that later historians and artists have turned to in the intervening years, for information which might otherwise have been lost. Many of the chapters of this book appeared as separate articles before the appearance of the book. For authorship of this book, Taft was awarded the Byron Caldwell Smith award, from the University of Kansas.  Selected bibliography  * Across the Years at Mt.

From 1990 to 2000 he was Minister of Justice of Saxony, and was a member of the Saxon Landtag from 1994 to 2009. From 1991 until his retirement in 2015 he was a member of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU). Life Childhood and youth Steffen Heitmann's father died in 1945 in a Soviet prisoner of war camp and his mother died 1957. Heitmann grew up with his grandparents. Studies and Profession Heitmann took his Abitur examination in Dresden in 1963, refused military service and began training at the German Evangelical Church administration. Heitmann studied theology and phylogeny at the University of Leipzig from 1964 to 1969, took state examinations in theology and in 1972 took the second theological examination. In 1971/73 he was a parish priest and pastor in the Dresden Evangelical Community. This was followed by a church legal training, which he completed in 1980 with the first and 1981 with the second juridical examination. In 1982 Heitmann became administrative director of the church district of Dresden. Politics Cabinet of the Free State of Saxony, Dresden, November 1990 (Heitmann is second from the right). Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-1108-021 In the autumn of 1989 Heitmann was legal adviser to the Dresden \\"Group of 20\\" opposition group. In April 1990, he headed the Working Group on the Gohrisch Draft Constitution of the Free State of Saxony. In 1990 Heitmann became State Minister of Justice of Saxony and joined the CDU in December 1991. In 1994 he was elected a member of the Saxon Landtag, representing the Dresden 2 constituency. In 1993, Heitmann was the CDU candidate for the May 1994 election of the President of Germany, chosen by Helmut Kohl. On 25 November 1993, after disputed statements on the role of women, the Holocaust and foreigners which were regarded as ultra- conservative or even reactionary by critics, he renounced his candidacy. The support of the FDP party in the 1994 Federal Assembly, essential to Heitmann's election, was already uncertain. The case also points to the possibly strong effect of the media. Surveys revealed that only a minority in the population agreed with Heitmann's expressed views. An interview with Heitmann in the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung on September 18, 1993, brought discussions on Heitmann's political positions. In the interview Heitmann talked about the multicultural society: \\"I consider this concept as a misguided program. A multicultural society can not be prescribed, it can grow at all costs.\\" On the nation, Heitmann said:\\"I am not afraid of the term. I am only frustrated by its misuse.\\" On the way to dealing with the Nazi past, Heitmann posed: \\"The German post-war role was in a way, a continuation of the presumed special role of the Nazi period. This is over. [...] I believe that the organized death of millions of Jews in gas chambers is indeed unique ‚Äì just as there are many historically unique events. There are no repeats in history anyway. But I do not believe that a special role of Germany can be derived from this until the end of history. The time has come ‚Äì the post-war period has finally come to an end with German unity ‚Äì to classify this event.\\" Heitmann referred in this context to taboos, which he saw in the political culture of Germany: \\"The odd thing is in the Federal Republic of Germany, that there are a few areas that are taboo. There is an intellectual debate which does not necessarily correspond to the feeling of the majority of the citizens, but can not be left unpunished. And this includes foreigners. This includes the past of Germany ‚Äì the Nazi past. This includes women. I believe that these debates must also be broken, even at the risk of being placed in certain corners in which one does not feel well.\\" Heitmann was co-editor of the week newspaper Rheinischer Merkur from 1995 to 2010. From 2003 to 2010 he was President of the Cultural Foundation of the Free State of Saxony. In 2000 accusations were made that Heitmann, as Minister of Justice, had influenced ongoing proceedings in favor of party friends. After a complaint by the Saxon Data Protection Supervisor and after protest letters from a large number of judges, he resigned from the ministry, but rejected any wrongdoing. He did not run for office in the 2009 state elections in Saxony. During the refugee crisis in Europe in 2015, Heitmann wrote an open letter to Chancellor Angela Merkel in late November, protesting against the refugee policy of the CDU. In the letter he held the Chancellor responsible for an \\"uncontrolled stream of refugees\\" and said, \\"I have never felt so alien to my country, even in the GDR.\\" Private life Steffen Heitmann has been married to the sculptor Christine Heitmann (born 1937) since 1965; the couple has two adult children.

The film was directed, produced, and animated by Priestley with sound designed and produced by R. Dennis Wiancko. Synopsis The Rubber Stamp Film was described by Walker Art Center Film Curator Melinda Ward as ‚ÄúAn imaginative, witty and energetic film. The images are all made from new and old rubber stamps which combine, entangle and collide at a rapid and joyous pace. A hundred little stories are told as the images zip by to a collaged soundtrack of voices and musical fragments. Pure delight!‚Äù Process In 1977, Joanna Priestley created a novelty rubber stamp company and sold stamps through the mail and at the Portland Saturday Market. In 1979 she purchased index cards at her local grocery store in Sisters, Oregon and began experimenting with animating rubber stamped images. For two years, all of the stamps that she used were part of her own collection. In 1981 she found two rubber stamp collectors in Portland, Oregon, who let her borrow stamps from their large collections to use in the film. Priestley used watercolors, stamp pad ink, felt pens and gouache to create approximately 2900 index card drawings. She developed a technique to make images fade in and out by stamping a sequence of cards without re-inking the rubber stamp and used vellum masks to hide parts of stamped images, allowing an image to go behind or in front of other stamps. The index cards were shot in 16mm with a Bolex camera that Priestley purchased at a flea market. She used a homemade animation stand that was a gift from Portland filmmaker Jim Blashfield. Soundtrack R. Dennis Wiancko created the soundtrack for The Rubber Stamp Film, which won a Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award in Los Angeles in 1984.Motion Picture Sound Editors, USA (1985)-IMDb He collected source material with a Tascam stereo cassette recorder and then layered the master together on a 1/4‚Äù open reel recorder. Wiancko used a wide variety of sources for the sound effects and music in the film including public domain audio from his collection of wax cylinder recordings and interviews that Priestley did with film scholar Gene Youngblood (author of Expanded Cinema) and her grandmother, Eva Irene Kennedy, which was used in the \\"swimming pool\\" section of the film. Almost every individual stamp in the Rubber Stamp Film has its own sound. Release The Rubber Stamp Film was released in 1983 and the world premiere was at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado, USA. The film was re-released on DVD in 2006 by Microcinema International. and it was screened in April 2009 a retrospective of Priestley's works in April 2009 at REDCAT in Los Angeles, CA and on October 18, 2019 at a retrospective at the Sweaty Eyeballs Animation Invitational in Baltimore, MD.

Together with his father and grandfather he was a major figure in the introduction of protestantism to Brandenburg.  Life  Thomas von dem Knesebeck to the right of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg on the SiegesalleeHe was born into one of the most prominent Brandenburg families as the son of Colonel Joachim von dem Knesebeck, who fought at the Siege of Vienna, and Margarethe von der Schulenburg.A. von dem Knesebeck: Haus und Dorf Carwe in der Grafschaft Ruppin. Berlin 1865 In his youth he studied law and the humanities in Helmstedt and Frankfurt (Oder) before the premature death of his father obliged him to return to the management of the family estates. His brother Hempo had already been killed in 1581 as a Colonel in Spanish services during the Eighty Years' War, while another brother was killed during the Siege of Metz (1552) as an officer in imperial services. During this period he published a memorandum on the administration of the Altmark, which brought him the attention of the Chancellor of Brandenburg, Lampert Distelmeyer, and subsequently appointments to the council and the courts. By 1602 he was raised to Privy Councillor and Landeshauptmann. In this capacity, which he held until his death, he was responsible for the reorganisation of Brandenburg case law and in particular regarding religious freedom.Isaacsohn, Siegfried, \\"Knesebeck, Thomas von dem\\" in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie 16 (1882), p.285 In 1612 Knesebeck made his conversion from the Lutheran confession to Calvinism public and was instrumental in bringing about the conversion of the Elector of Brandenburg, John Sigismund, a year later. Earlier under John Sigismund's father Joachim Frederick, he had still felt obliged to conceal this. When attempts by John Sigismund to introduce mass conversion met with significant resistance from the still Lutheran population, Knesebeck ensured that Lutheranism and Calvinism would be equal confessions, with broad tolerance for Catholicism and Judaism. He died in 1625, succeeded by his sons Thomas, Hempo and Levin. Thomas immediately inherited the position of Landeshauptmann, followed in turn by his brother Hempo. In 1901 he was honoured with inclusion among the statues of the Siegesallee, as a bust next to John Sigismund.

Her published works were Her Brother Donnard (1891), and In the Garden and Other Poems (1894). Her Brother Donnard proved her gift as a story-teller. Although this book was her first, the second edition was bought out within a year. Among her most popular poems were \\"The Twilight Hour,\\" \\"In My Dreams,\\" and \\"A Voice.\\" She wrote after having become an invalid in a railway accident. Early life and education Emily Elizabeth Ferris was born in 1841, in the valley of Lake Champlain, in New York. On one side of the family, she was the granddaughter of Judge McOmlier. Her paternal grandmother was a poet. Bishop Daniel Ayres Goodsell was her cousin. Veeder was a student in Packer Collegiate Institute, Brooklyn, New York. She wrote verses at the age of nine, but it was the direct influence of her brother-in-law, Asahel Stearns, a professor of law, and of the notable people who gathered about him and her sister, which elevated her taste for literature and rendered it absorbing. Her culture was increased by travel and by contact with many others. She married Herman Veeder, on September 28, 1876. Career Her first book was Her Brother Donnard (Philadelphia, 1891). Veeder occasionally contributed verses to prominent periodicals. Her first appearance with a collected volume of poetry, however, was in the book to which the first poem, \\"In The Garden\\", gave its title (1895). She arranged several of her poems to music of her own composition. Much of the time, she was exhausted by invalidism. In her hours of pain, she rose above physical suffering and her habitual temper was buoyant and helpful. She possessed originality and piquancy. A keen observation of human nature and a nice discrimination of character give point to her conversation and her literary work. She was very facile with anecdotes. Some of her purely outdoor work shows her genuine love of nature; while in her versified story, \\"Entranced\\", her narrative power stood out, and her \\"Austin‚Äôs Painting of Christ\\" revealed the true devotional bent of her mind. In private life, Veeder was eminently practical. She was a member of the Woman's Press Club of Pittsburgh, in which city she resided until she visited the World's Columbian Exposition (1893). During that visit, she received injuries (consequent to a railway accident) which kept her in Chicago thereafter. At the Authors' Congress of the Columbian Exposition, Veeder originated and introduced the idea of an Author's Institute, which she hoped to establish in Chicago.

History Orquesta Panorama was founded in 1988. It made its first performance that same year on the 25th of December in the municipal of O Rosal. At the time the Orquesta had eight members along with a sound team. All the musicians at the time were male and they used a van to transport the instruments along with all the members. It was not until 1993 that this band started to transform into what it is today. Manuel Garrido, otherwise known at Lito, stressed the importance of high quality sound and light systems. He also made sure that the dancers and people that played musical instruments have a greater role. Eventually they started Panorama Kids which is meant for younger children. 2016 Angel Martinez Perez scandal Angel Martinez Perez was the agent for approximately eighty different Orquestas including Orquesta Panorama. In 2016 Angel Martinez Perez was accused of fraud in the fiscal years 2011 and 2012. He declared that the Orquestas he represented, including Orquesta Panorama, had made a total of $4 million euros those two years when the number was closer to $50 million in reality. In 2018 he was sentenced to twelve years in prison for the $8.9 million euros of income the government lost during these years. He was able to get away with this because practically everything was paid for in cash from the performances to the performers. This left as small of a paper trail as possible. The scandal left the band's future in uncertainty until it was bought by a company in Lugo for an undisclosed amount.

The stable was formed by Cole, Fish and O'Reilly on August 19, 2017 at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III shortly after signing with WWE, although Fish and O'Reilly had already been a tag team since 2012 under the name reDRagon. After, Fish suffered an injury in March 2018, April 7 at NXT TakeOver: New Orleans marked a turning point for The Undisputed Era: during the event, Cole became the inaugural NXT North American Champion, he and O'Reilly won the 2018 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic, and Strong joined the stable at the end of a lengthy feud against it; both Cole and Strong were subsequently recognized as co-Tag Team Champions under the Freebird Rule. O'Reilly later had two more additional reigns as NXT Tag Team Champion, one with Strong and one with Fish, while Cole became NXT Champion at NXT TakeOver: XXV, becoming NXT's second Triple Crown winner. On September 18, Strong won the NXT North American Championship, making The Undisputed Era the first stable to simultaneously hold all the male titles on NXT. All four stayed champions until January 22, 2020, when Strong lost his title to Keith Lee.  History   Origins  In 2010, Adam Cole and Kyle O'Reilly debuted in Ring of Honor as a tag team that would later be named \\"Future Shock\\", but the two split up in 2012 and began a longstanding rivalry against each other. In December 2012, O'Reilly formed a new tag team with Bobby Fish known as reDRagon, with the two winning the ROH World Tag Team Championship on three occasions, while Cole would form his own stable in 2014 known as The Kingdom. In the summer of 2015, reDRagon entered into a feud with The Kingdom, and began teaming with Cole after he seemingly had a falling out with his teammates and left the group. However, Cole's exit from The Kingdom was revealed to be a hoax when he attacked O'Reilly during his match for the ROH World Championship at All Star Extravaganza VII on September 18. Their reignited rivalry continued until January 2017, when O'Reilly left Ring of Honor in hopes of signing with WWE. Cole and Fish would follow suit, with Cole leaving in May and Fish in June. During their years in Ring of Honor, Cole, O'Reilly and Fish each had several matches against, and occasionally teaming with, fellow ROH wrestler Roderick Strong. On the July 12, 2017 episode of NXT, Fish made his NXT debut, losing to Aleister Black. On the August 2 episode of NXT, O'Reilly made his NXT debut, also losing to Black.  Formation and tag team success (2017‚Äì2019)  At NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III on August 19, Fish and O'Reilly debuted as a team, attacking the newly crowned NXT Tag Team Champions, SAnitY (Alexander Wolfe and Eric Young), as well as their opponents for the night, The Authors of Pain. Later that night, the two aligned themselves with Adam Cole and attacked newly crowned NXT Champion Drew McIntyre. The following month, the trio of Cole, Fish and O'Reilly was officially dubbed \\"The Undisputed Era\\". On the October 11 episode of NXT, Taynara Conti interfered in a triple threat match between Nikki Cross, Peyton Royce and Liv Morgan on behalf of The Undisputed Era, preventing Cross of SAnitY from winning. At NXT TakeOver: WarGames, The Undisputed Era defeated SAnitY and The Authors of Pain and Roderick Strong in a WarGames match, the first of its kind in 20 years. On the December 20 episode of NXT, (taped on November 29), Fish and O'Reilly defeated SAnitY (Eric Young and Killian Dain) to capture the NXT Tag Team Championship, marking their first title win in WWE. On the January 10, 2018 episode of NXT, Fish and O'Reilly were scheduled to defend their titles against SAnitY in a rematch, but assaulted them backstage, rendering them unable to compete. Later that night, they were forced to defend their championships against Black and Strong by NXT general manager William Regal, and successfully retained their titles after Cole interfered and distracted Black. At NXT TakeOver: Philadelphia, The Undisputed Era defeated The Authors of Pain to retain the titles. On March 4, Fish suffered a torn ACL and MCL in his left knee at an NXT live event. On April 7 at NXT TakeOver: New Orleans, Cole became the inaugural NXT North American Champion in a ladder match also involving EC3, Killian Dain, Lars Sullivan, Ricochet and Velveteen Dream. Later in the night, O'Reilly and Cole (in place of the injured Fish) successfully defended the NXT Tag Team Championships against The Authors of Pain and Strong and Pete Dunne after Strong turned on Dunne to allow O'Reilly to pin him, joining the stable and turning heel in the process. With Strong joining the group, he was also recognized as part of the NXT Tag Team Champions. At NXT TakeOver: Chicago, O'Reilly and Strong successfully defended the titles against Danny Burch and Oney Lorcan. After developing a rivalry with British Strong Style (Dunne, Trent Seven and Tyler Bate), the two factions faced off on the first day of the WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament event, where The Undisputed Era lost. On the second day of the event, O'Reilly and Strong lost the NXT Tag Team Championship to Seven and Bate. However, O'Reilly and Strong regained the titles just two days later (aired on tape delay on July 11). With the win, O'Reilly and Strong became just the second team in NXT history to win the titles more than once (the other being The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson). At NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn 4, O'Reilly and Strong retained their titles against Bate and Seven. After the match, O'Reilly and Strong were attacked by the debuting War Raiders (Hanson and Rowe). On the same night, Cole lost the North American Championship to Ricochet. On the August 29 episode of NXT, Cole and Strong defeated Ricochet and Dunne and attacked them along with O'Reilly after the match. However, the War Raiders came to the ring, chasing The Undisputed Era away. On the October 10 episode of NXT, Ricochet defeated Cole and Dunne in a triple threat match to retain the North American Championship. On the October 17 episode of NXT, O'Reilly and Strong retained the NXT Tag Team Championship against the War Raiders by disqualification after Fish returned from injury and attacked Hanson and Rowe. On the October 31 episode of NXT, Cole and Fish were scheduled to face the War Raiders. However, Hanson and Rowe attacked The Undisputed Era during a backstage promo. The brawl ended up in the ring, where The Undisputed Era got the upper-hand. Ricochet and Dunne entered on the War Raiders' behalf as the brawl progressed to even the odds. While the groups were fighting, general manager William Regal announced that The Undisputed Era would face the team of the War Raiders, Ricochet and Dunne in a WarGames match at NXT TakeOver: WarGames. At the event, The Undisputed Era were defeated after both Ricochet and Dunne pinned Cole. At NXT TakeOver: Phoenix, The Undisputed Era lost the NXT Tag Team Championships to The War Raiders.  Domination of NXT, various feuds and face turn (2019‚Äì2020)  All four members competed at NXT TakeOver: XXV. Strong lost to Matt Riddle in the opening match. Fish and O'Reilly were unsuccessful in a four-way ladder match for the vacant NXT Tag Team Championship. In the event's main event, Cole defeated Johnny Gargano to win the NXT Championship. The win made Cole the second Triple Crown winner in NXT history (behind Gargano). On the August 15 tapings of NXT, O'Reilly and Fish defeated Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) for the NXT Tag Team Championships, making O'Reilly the first wrestler to become a three-time NXT Tag Team Champion. On September 18, 2019 during the debut episode of NXT on the USA Network, Roderick Strong defeated Velveteen Dream for the NXT North American Championship, marking Strong's first singles title in WWE, and making The Undisputed Era the first group to be draped in gold and hold all male championships on the NXT brand; the WWE Cruiserweight Championship became the NXT Cruiserweight Championship on October 9, therefore elevating the number of male NXT titles to four. In the build-up for the NXT and NXT UK co-branded pay-per-view, Worlds Collide, The Undisputed Era began feuding with Imperium (WWE United Kingdom Champion Walter, Alexander Wolfe, Fabian Aichner and Marcel Barthel), which was further intensified during the closing moments of NXT UK TakeOver: Blackpool II on January 12, 2020, where the group attacked Imperium following Walter's successful title defense against Joe Coffey. At Worlds Collide, Imperium defeated The Undisputed Era despite being outnumbered 4-3 after Wolfe suffered an injury early in the match. In parallel, Strong lost his title to Keith Lee, while Fish and O'Reilly took part in the 2020 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic, defeating NXT UK Tag Team Champions Gallus (Mark Coffey and Wolfgang) in the first round and losing to Grizzled Young Veterans (James Drake and Zack Gibson) in the semifinals thanks to a distraction from Imperium. At NXT TakeOver: Portland, Cole successfully retained his title against Tommaso Ciampa after receiving assistance from the rest of The Undisputed Era and Johnny Gargano, who attacked Ciampa with the belt. However, Fish and O'Reilly lost the tag team titles to Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic winners The BroserWeights (Matt Riddle and Pete Dunne), leaving The Undisputed Era with only one title for the first time since August 2019. On the April 22 episode of NXT, Velveteen Dream and Dexter Lumis (replacing Keith Lee, who was attacked by Damian Priest before the match) defeated Cole and Strong in a tag team match, where Dream pinned Cole. This led to an NXT Championship match on the May 6 episode of NXT where Cole successfully retained his title against Dream and again at NXT TakeOver: In Your House on June 7 in a last chance Backlot Brawl match, due to the stipulation at the event where if Dream lost he can no longer challenge for the NXT Championship again while Cole was still champion. On the July 8 episode of NXT, The Great American Bash Night 2, Cole would lose the NXT Championship to Keith Lee in a Winner Take All match, ending his historic reign at 403 days. Though Cole later turned face after entering into a feud with Pat McAfee, Fish and Strong remained as heels. On the September 8th edition of NXT, Fish and Strong entered into a feud with Killian Dain, with Drake Maverick making the save and the Undisputed Era running off. On the September 16th edition of NXT, O'Reilly turned face after saving Jake Atlas from a beatdown at the hands of Tommaso Ciampa. Cole cemented his face turn on the September 30th episode of NXT after calling out Austin Theory, who had insulted O'Reilly earlier in the night during a backstage promo.

He also recalls Pop telling him about Kinnie Wagner, a white inmate who looked after the dogs at Parchman (based on the real-life Kenny Wagner). Because of Pop's affinity with animals, Kinnie chooses him to help look after the dogs. Leonie's party arrives at the house of a white woman, and Jojo walks around and finds a man cooking meth. Misty leaves the woman's house with a bag of meth which she tries to hide from Jojo and Kayla. Back in the car, Kayla starts to get sick and throw up. Leonie remembers Mam teaching her about plants that help with an upset stomach. Leonie needs wild strawberries but is only able to find wild blackberries. Jojo holds Kayla and tries to comfort her by telling her stories. Eventually, they pull over to Al, Michael's lawyer's house. Leonie cooks the blackberry leaves. Jojo doesn‚Äôt trust Leonie and doesn‚Äôt think the wild blackberries will help but he is afraid Leonie will hit him if he says anything. After Leonie, Misty, and Al leave the room, Jojo forces Kayla to throw up Leonie's mixture. Instead of sleeping, Jojo recalls Pop telling him about when Richie got whipped for breaking his hoe and Kinnie escaped from Parchman. In the morning they drive to Parchman and check Michael out of prison. When Michael comes out, he embraces Leonie. He tries to hold Kayla but she doesn‚Äôt recognize him. Kayla throws up again. Jojo looks outside the car and sees a dark skinned boy, Richie. The next chapter is narrated by Richie. He recognizes Jojo as Pop's child. He recalls how Pop protected him while they were in Parchman. No one in the car but Jojo and Kayla can see Richie. On the drive back, they are pulled over by a police officer. There is no time to hide the meth Al gave them, so Leonie swallows it. Leonie, without thinking, tells the officer that they are coming back from Parchman. The officer handcuffs Leonie. He also handcuffs Michael. Jojo walks out of the car with Michael and the officer handcuffs him too. Jojo reaches into his pocket to grab the gris-gris bag Pop gave him and the officer pulls out his gun on him. Misty drops Kayla, who runs to Jojo and wraps herself around him. Kayla throws up on the officer and he lets them go. Back in the car, Leonie, who is high from the meth she swallowed, becomes sick. Michael pulls over at a gas station and gives Jojo money to buy milk and charcoal. Leonie drinks the mixture and throws up. Richie tells Jojo that he tried to run from Parchman but died in the process. He doesn‚Äôt remember what happened and he needs Pop to tell him so he can go home. Richie was only able to leave Parchman when Jojo showed up. When they arrive back at the house, they realize that Mam and Pop are not in the house. Michael wants to go to his parents' house but Leonie doesn‚Äôt want to. She eventually gives in. When they arrive at Michael's parents' house, at first Michael's mother, Maggie, is civil and urges Michael's dad, Big Joseph, to do the same. Big Joseph is unable to restrain himself and calls Leonie a slur. Michael head-butts Big Joseph and they start fighting. They drive back home where Pop and Mam have returned. Leonie goes and she tells Leonie to gather necessary items to perform a ritual to summon Maman Brigitte, a death loa in voodoo. Once they get back home, Richie sees Pop and tries to talk to him, but Pop can‚Äôt see him. Jojo asks Pop about what happened to Richie and Pop finally tells Jojo. A man named Blue raped one of the female inmates at Parchman. Richie catches Blue in the act and escapes Parchman with him. While they are running, Blue happens upon a white girl and rips her dress. Because of this, the local white population is looking for revenge through lynching. Pop knows that the white men won't make a distinction between Blue and Richie. When the white men catch up with Blue and Richie, they skin Blue alive and cut off parts of his body. To protect Richie from the same fate, Pop stabs him in the neck. Pop has been haunted by this action ever since. After he tells Jojo the story, he breaks down into tears and Jojo consoles him. Richie screams and disappears. Leonie enters Mam's room to find her in a terrible state. Her room smells like rot. Mam tells Leonie that it is too late. Mam sees Richie on the ceiling. He is vengeful. Richie shouts at Mam, urging her to come with him, but Given shouts at him that Mam is not his mother. Jojo and Pop run in and Leonie jumps into action and begins saying the litany to summon Maman Brigitte. Jojo tells Richie to leave because nobody owes him anything anymore. Richie leaves and Given takes Mam with him. Mam dies. Michael comes back and he and Leonie leave. In the final chapter, Jojo explains that he sleeps in Leonie's bed now. Leonie and Michael only come back for two days out every week, and then they leave again. Pop sleeps in Mam's room now and he talks to himself at night, searching for Mam. Although he hoped he will, Jojo is not able to see Mam and Given, he only sees Richie. He also sees other ghosts who have all died through violent means. Kayla tells the ghosts to go home but they don‚Äôt listen to her. She begins to sing and they all smile with relief.  Reception  Reviewing the novel for The Washington Post, Ron Charles compared it to George Saunders's Lincoln in the Bardo and Toni Morrison's Beloved; at NPR, Annalisa Quinn found it \\"reminiscent of As I Lay Dying\\" by William Faulkner.

Synopsis The Dancing Bulrushes is based on an Ojibwa Native American story about Coyote, the trickster. The film was made by animating beach sand frame by frame, on top of a sheet of glass, directly under the camera. Process Directors Joanna Priestley and Steven Subotnick made The Dancing Bulrushes in 1984 and 1985, when they were MFA students in the Experimental Animation Department at California Institute of the Arts. When Priestley arrived at the school in 1983, she found that it was not possible to enroll in several classes she was interested in. She decided to create an independent study class to learn a new animation technique. When she asked other students if they were interested, Subotnick responded immediately. They decided to do a film using sand animation and found an Ojibwa Native American story about Coyote in a book by Barry Lopez when they were researching narrative possibilities. Priestley and Subotnick drove to Santa Barbara to collect beach sand, which needed filtering to remove cigarette butts and other debris. They built a shallow box with a Plexiglass base surrounded by strips of wood to contain the sand. Priestley and Subotnick animated side by side, using their hands, small brushes and tortillons. Collaborators The Dancing Bulrushes was written by Barry Lopez and is featured in his book Giving Birth to Thunder, Sleeping with His Daughter: Coyote Builds North America. The filmmakers contacted Lopez and received written permission to use the story as the basis for their film. The music for The Dancing Bulrushes was composed and performed by Miroslav Tadiƒá, who was on the faculty of the Music Department at California Institute of the Arts. The film was narrated by Fran Bennett, Head of Acting/Director of Performance at CalArts from 1996-2003. Release The film was re-released on DVD in 2006 by Microcinema International, and it was screened in a retrospective of Priestley's works at REDCAT in Los Angeles on April 20, 2009. In addition to festival screenings, The Dancing Bulrushes was shown at the Museum of Modern Art (New York, USA), Cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise, Centre Pompidou (Paris, France), Masters of Animation Festival (Trivandrum, India) and the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis, USA).

CBS introduced the series in 1993, and Dr. Quinn was played by Jane Seymour. The series ran for six seasons, ending in 1998. Seymour reprised the role in two made for TV movies, Dr. Quinn: Revolutions (1999) and Dr. Quinn: The Heart Within (2001), following the series cancellation. Jane Seymour's portrayal of Dr. Michaela Quinn has been widely viewed as an iconic, western character, earning Seymour a Golden Globe award. Background Michaela Quinn was born into a wealthy family in Boston. With the encouragement of Josef Quinn, her father and a doctor in his own right, she attends the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania and becomes licensed herself. Unable to find respect as a female physician in a practice of her own, she works with her father in his clinic until his death. Once again faced with discrimination as an independent, female doctor, she pursues employment outside of Boston. After being mistaken for \\"Michael A. Quinn\\", (a man) she is offered a job via telegraph in the Colorado Territory. Upon her arrival, the townsfolk discover the error and attempt to withdraw the offer of employment. Michaela insists, however, that she is up to the challenge, and she is reluctantly offered the job as town doctor in Colorado Springs, Colorado. There she starts her own medical clinic in the town, in lieu of being employed by the town directly, giving her autonomy in her medical practice. She also begins actively trying to change the townfolks attitudes toward modern medicine, the Cheyenne and other Native American peoples, and a host of other, more progressive attitudes not entirely shared by the frontier-minded residents. She adopts three children after her friend and their mother, Charlotte Cooper, was bitten by a rattlesnake and succumbs to the venom. Quinn is a very independent woman who often clashes with the townsfolk, but more often than not she is successful in changing or at the least softening their attitudes. Soon after her arrival she falls in love with a man named Byron Sully, played by Joe Lando, who is very interested in Indian culture and spends most of his time with the Indians. Her mother is devastated that her daughter has decided to leave and live in Colorado Springs, but after a visit she changes her mind and to a certain extent accepts Michaela's decision. Later, her mother again travels to Colorado to attend her wedding, giving her blessing for Michaela to marry Sully. The elder Mrs. Quinn warms to the family, even sending young Brian a poodle after his pet wolf, Pup, is killed by rabies. Her mother, Elizabeth, travels to Colorado Springs a third time, with Michaela's sisters in tow, to witness the birth of her daughter, Katherine Elizabeth Sully, who they nickname Katie.  Social issues  Dr. Mike often used her position as a doctor and care giver to seize the moral high ground and challenge the townspeople on their often narrow, conservative views of the time. Some examples include:  Racism, anti- semitism and other bigotry  After regular series characters, blacksmith Robert E. (portrayed by Henry G. Sanders) and his restaurateur wife, Grace, (Jonelle Allen) a freed-slave couple, buy a home in downtown Colorado Springs, they are immediately challenged by the banker, Jedediah Bancroft (portrayed by George Furth, Season 2, Episode 19, \\"The First Circle\\"). Bancroft responds to the sale of a prominent home in the town to a black couple by forming a local Ku Klux Klan chapter, for which it is revealed that Bancroft is a grand wizard. The townsfolk are tricked into joining, since they were only told they were joining a men's club. However, it soon becomes clear what Bancroft's true intentions are, and Quinn intervenes as some members of the town are about to hang Robert E. Chastising them for their racism while wearing their \\"ridiculous costumes\\", she pulls the hood off of Bancroft, exposing him undeniably as their leader. Shamed as a violent racist and trouble maker, Bancroft is never seen in Colorado Springs again. Michaela Quinn and her family also warmly befriend the local Cheyenne people, including Chief Black Kettle (played by Nick Ramus), and his right-hand man, Cloud Dancing (Larry Sellers). Dr. Quinn and her adopted family, followed shortly after by Sully, travel to Washington D.C. (Season 3, Episodes 7 and 8, \\"The Washington Affair\\", Part 1 and 2) to lobby the government on behalf of the Cheyenne. They meet with Congressional leaders, testify before hearings and even meet with President Ulysses S. Grant (Dennis Lipscomb). They are given mostly platitudes and empty promises, although Grant seems the most accommodating. After a fictional portrayal of the real-life Battle of Washita River (Season 3, Episodes 24 and 25, \\"Washita\\"), in which Black Kettle and most of his clan are killed, Quinn has an emotional break down. Cloud Dancing is not at Washita, and therefore survives, although his wife is killed. Cloud Dancing remains a close friend of the Sully/Quinn family throughout the series. Dr. Quinn also fights for the rights of Chinese immigrants, a Jewish salesman who visits the town, and other racial and religious minorities.  Censorship  The issue of censorship is dealt with on the series when Michaela Quinn's mother sends her late father's extensive book collection to Colorado Springs. Rather than keep them for herself, Dr. Quinn convinces the town to open a public library, which is named the Josef Quinn Memorial Library. Trouble soon brews, however, when the town realizes that many of the titles' subject matter stray from their traditionally conservative, Christian beliefs. Events escalate until an attempted book burning ensues. Stopped by Dr. Mike, Sully and the children, the town realizes they have gone too far and help restore the books. (Season 3, Episode 5, \\"The Library\\")  Evolution  While espousing a genuine belief in God along with most of the town, Dr. Quinn nonetheless differs with most of the town on Darwinism.

Founded in 2013 in Quebec City, the collective grounds its collaborative performance art practice in questions about invisibility and visibility through action art in cities. Geographically dispersed, the members of the collective produce simultaneous actions in the different cities within the metropolitan areas and regions of Canada, primarily in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. Active on a monthly basis since 2013, the collective infiltrates variable and varied public spaces. Bringing together individuals around the aesthetic and political principles of taking action, invisibility and community,Fiala, Julie Marie. \\"Ethics of Listening: Examining Methods and Praxes Toward a Community-Centred Art\\". Queens University Press, 2015, p. 1. since 2016, Le Tas Invisible has been participating in Equinox to Equinox. These are global manifestations presenting simultaneous collective performances within public spaces, organized in conjunction with the Bbeyond performance collective, (Belfast, Northern Ireland) with more than thirty like-minded collectives dispersed in different cities of several countries around the world. As an art collective practicing action art within the public spaces, Le Tas Invisible includes a number of specificities (see the section below that is devoted to these characteristics). Please note that, in this Wiki entry, certain names and places are purposely left anonymous. This is aligned with the aesthetic and political mission of the invisible collective and its critique of institutional visibility, self-promotion and their systemic conventions Declaration of Guiding Principles alt=Le Tas Invisible ‚Äì Quebec City, 16 Sept 2017 alt=Quebec City ‚Äì Equinox to Equinox 2016 History Tas Invisible, Being in Public, Equinox to Equinox, Quebec 2016 The collective, Le Tas Invisible, was founded in 2013 following a performance art workshop led by Alastair MacLennan, the Scottish-born performance artist who help found Bbeyond in Belfast (Northern Ireland). This particular workshop, held at Inter/Le Lieu, centre en art actuel (Quebec City, Quebec, Canada), was attended by those who would be Le Tas Invisibles founding members. The collective's first Performance Monthly meetings or Performance Monthlies (PMs), which since its inception advocates for the inclusion of all the participants in \\"accidental\\" and \\"fleeting\\" (from the French, \\"furtive\\") performances within the public spaces (or alternative spaces) on the basis of voluntary, free association and anonymity, took place from 2013 to 2014 in the City of Quebec. In 2014, a first \\"tas invisible\\" (invisible gathering) was held in Ottawa. Moreover, in 2014, a first geographically-dispersed tas invisible took place simultaneously in two cities ‚Äì Quebec City (Quebec) and Grande Prairie (Alberta). As such, the collective opts for multi-site, simultaneous manifestations despite differences of time and space. In 2014, Le Tas Invisible travelled to Northern Ireland in order to participate in a festival at Belfast presented by the Bbeyond collective, which is internationally acclaimed for its contribution to innovate performance art. The collective's activities have also included projects such as an artist's residency at Flax International, during which they performed in Derry. In 2016, Le Tas Invisible was dormant for six months. Thereafter, the collective resumed its activities in full force. New branches of the collective have sprouted in many cities in the province of Quebec, such as in Montr√©al and Rimouski in 2016, and in 2017, in Trois-Rivi√®res. In 2014, a \\"tas\\" in Ottawa/Gatineau become active, multiplying its members and manifestation from 2016 onwards. Occasionally, the collective performs by including international contributors from countries such as Germany and Spain, or members perform in other cities (for example in Bratislava, Madrid, Nice, Tel Aviv). They need no formal invitation to perform and manifest themselves through action. Therefore, those who act are indeed Le Tas. On September 22, 2016, the various splinters groups of Le Tas Invisible acted in synchronicity with an international gathering of performance art called the Rencontre internationale d'art performance (RiAP), organized by Inter/Le Lieu. As a discrete manifestation presented outside of the official festival, the global event was called Equinox to Equinox: Same Difference. Initiated by the collective Bbeyond, to which Le Tas Invisible was invited to collaborate, the manifestation included more than 37 groups of performers performing simultaneously throughout the world. On September 22, 2017, for exceptional reasons, Le Tas Invisible decided to out its own invisibility for a day in support of the Day of Public Action for Freedom and Democracy. Initiated by the performance artist and cultural activist called Chumpon Apisuk (Thailand), following Equinox to Equinox, this day was an extension of the symposium program called Being in Public: Encounters ‚Äì Outer Place and Inner Space, again organized by Bbeyond in Northern Ireland, where Le Tas Invisible contributed. During the autumn Equinox, the collective manifested itself throughout Canada through manifestation of art in action in public spaces in Ottawa (Ontario), Montreal (Quebec), Quebec City (Qu√©bec), Trois-Rivi√®res (Qu√©bec), Rimouski (Quebec), Hermit Lake (Alberta), Edmonton (Alberta), Lethbridge (Alberta), and Victoria, (British Columbia) ‚Äì simultaneously. A letter signed by Bbeyond and the 37 performance collectives scattered across the globe participating in the equinoctial event (including Le Tas Invisible) is circulating from country to country and will be provided to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights principal religious representatives of the world in order to declare the autumn Equinox a Day for Freedom and Democracy in public.

Martin fought in the American Revolutionary War and was the only doctor at the Battle of King's Mountain, as well as being the only doctor in the \\"Over Mountain Men\\". After the war, Martin was conscripted by John Sevier to settle the territory claimed after the signing of the Treaty of Dumplin's Creek in 1785. He and Frederick Emert moved into what was later named \\"Emert's Cove\\" (now Pittman Center) and became charter citizens of what would become Sevier County, Tennessee. Martin died in 1787 in Emert's Cove.  Pre- Revolutionary War  Martin Shultz was born in the Manchester Township, then found in records of both Lancaster and York County, in Colonial Pennsylvania on April 3, 1740. His father, Velten (Valentine), was a German immigrant that had come to the America's in 1731. His mother, Maria Eva Stocker, was a Swiss immigrant that had arrived in the America's in 1733. As a young man, Martin was apprenticed in the skill of shoemaking due to a lack thereof in the Lancaster County area. He and his wife Julianna Stentz moved into the York County region after getting married at Christ Lutheran Church on July 28, 1761. The following month (August) in 1761, Martin volunteered to apprentice a 16 year old named Philip Bayer in shoemaking, and in 1763 transferred this apprenticeship to another local shoemaker, Daniel Peterman.York County Orphans Court Minutes, 31 August 1763. Evidently, Martin sought the release of this obligation due to his desire to move south into the Carolina colonies. Sometime in 1764, he and his family moved to Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, settling in the area of Killian's Creek and Leeper's Creek. From March 1765 to December 1772, Martin was an active member of the local legislature, taking part as a witness to several land grants and deed signings. Between August 1762 and 1775, Martin and his wife Julianna had 6 children: Valentine K., David Alexander Preston, John Rudicile, Jacob, Martin \\"S.E.\\", and Julia Ann. North Carolina land registry detailing Martin Shultz's purchasing 160 acres of land; dated August 9, 1787. On 24 December 1772, Martin purchased 300 acres of land from Henry Dellinger for 10 pounds, located at the head waters of Leeper's Creek, or current day Lincoln County, NC. They would live on this land until June 21, 1777, when they sold the 300 acres for 70 pounds. On the deed of the sale, both he and his wife signed in the old German script, but notably, Martin signed \\"Doctor Martin Shultz\\" indicating that sometime while living in Mecklenburg he received training as a medical doctor. Between the Fall of 1777 and Winter of 1778, Martin and his family moved to Washington County, NC (now Sullivan County, TN) on the South side of the Holston River. In November 1779, Martin purchased 200 acres of land there in Washington County. He was listed as owning 350 total acres in the county tax lists for 1779.  Revolutionary War Service  Martin was recruited to service in August 1780. He fought in the favor of the Patriots upon the invasion of Major Patrick Ferguson of the British Army into the westernmost flank of General Charles Cornwallis' line of advance. The militia that was collected from the Appalachian Mountains became known as the \\"Overmountain Men\\" due to their coming across the mountains to engage the redcoats. Among their ranks, Martin is recorded as serving as the only surgeon (doctor) specifically in Colonel John Sevier's Company. It was in this Company that Martin likely met Frederick Emert. While it is very likely that Shultz served as doctor for the entirety of the Overmountain Men's assembly, Martin is known to have certainly been present when the unit engaged the British Army at the Battle of King's Mountain. The battle lasted a little more than an hour, and was a clear victory for the Patriots. King's Mountain served as one of the most shocking and decisive British defeats in the war. * British General Sir Henry Clinton would later comment that the American victory at King's Mountain \\"so encouraged the spirit of rebellion in the Carolinas that it could never afterward be humbled.\\" * \\"That glorious victory was the joyful annunciation of that turn in the tide of success which terminated the Revolutionary War.\\" -Thomas Jefferson about the Battle of King's Mountain.  Post-Revolutionary War and Death  In 1785, Governor John Sevier signed the Treaty of Dumplin Creek, which \\"Ceded the territory south of the French Broad and Holston Rivers and west of the Big Pigeon River and east of the ridge dividing Little River from the Tennessee River to the State of Franklin.\\" Upon signing this treaty, Sevier began conscripting trusted men to settle the new territory. Two of these men that Sevier trusted were Martin Shultz and Frederick Emert, who had both served with Sevier in the Revolutionary War.

It is a sequel to Stake Land (2010). Plot Martin, who had settled down with the woman he met at the climax of the first film, attempts to track down Mister after his wife and daughter are killed in an attack lead by a scarred sentient female vampire. Martin eventually finds him after being forced by cannibals into fighting him. Mister recognizes Martin and together they escape from the cannibals while rescuing a feral girl. Mister, Martin and the feral girl find an abandoned house to stay the night but are later attacked by the cult from the first film. It is later revealed that they serve the scarred vampire and that they have been looking for Mister. The scarred vampire had killed Martin's family with the intent of using a vengeful Martin to find Mister. Martin, Mister, and the feral girl manage to escape and capture one of the younger cultists who tells them that he was forced into going along with the cult. Mister's group bumps into another group, one of whom Mister recognizes as an old friend, they are then taken to their base where another of Mister's old friends helps him heal and recuperate. The cultist is locked in a small room, but later escapes after tricking a woman into thinking he had hanged himself and murders her. The cultist then alerts the rest of the cult and the vampires of the base's whereabouts. The base is attacked and Mister instantly recognizes the scarred vampire as a vampire he had attempted to kill in the past, only succeeding in scarring her. A flashback shows that the scarred vampire had given birth to a child who Mister killed. The base's defense holds, thanks in part to some flood lights powered by a generator, and the scarred vampire signals for her troops to retreat. Knowing the scarred vampire and her troops will return, Mister and Martin, along with Mister's old friends try and buy time by combating the threat while the civilians evacuate. The feral girl is forced to go with the civilians but later escapes and tries to come back to Mister. The cult and vampires attack that night, this time using a suicide bomber to destroy the generator. Martin and Mister manage to kill the scarred vampire but Mister is wounded. Meanwhile, Mister's old friends get trapped in the kitchen but two of them sacrifice themselves by blowing themselves as well as several attackers up. Later while trying to escape and follow the civilians, a vampire approaches Martin and Mister. The feral girl comes to their aid, having grown attached to Mister. She was bitten by a vampire earlier after leaving the civilians and Mister kills her out of mercy. Saddened and disillusioned, Mister tells Martin he can't do it anymore and makes Martin leave while he stays behind to fight the remaining vampires who had followed them from the base. Release Stake Land II debuted on digital platforms on February 7, 2017 with Blu-ray and DVD release on February 14, 2017. Damici has expressed interest in making the series a trilogy but noted that MPI owns the property so it is ultimately up to them. Reception Bloody Disgusting gave the film three and a half out of four skulls saying \\"The film doesn‚Äôt capture that same success that the first film had, but it‚Äôs still a worthy follow-up for those who enjoyed the original.\\" Nerdist said \\"While Stake Land II is clearly working on a small budget, the filmmakers do all they can to deliver a fast-moving post-apocalyptic ‚Äúquest‚Äù movie full of gory vampire attacks, colorful stock character archetypes, and a slyly surly attitude.\\" Dread Central found the film mildly disappointing saying \\"Overall, the film acts as a serviceable addition to the story, but the regrettable element is that it could have been so much more ‚Äì still is worth a watch for fans who sharpened their fangs on the first movie.\\"  See also  *Vampire film  References   External links  2016 films 2016 horror films 2010s science fiction films English-language films American films American independent films American science fiction horror films Post-apocalyptic films Vampires in film Films set in the United States ","title":"Stake Land II"},{"id":"55452167","text":"Lophoproctidae is a family of millipedes in the order Polyxenida containing approximately 65 species in 6 genera.

Life  He was born into one of the most prominent Brandenburg families as the son of Landeshauptmann Thomas von dem Knesebeck (the Elder), who introduced Calvinism to Brandenburg and affected the conversion of the Elector of Brandenburg, John Sigismund. Isaacsohn, Siegfried, \\"Knesebeck, Thomas von dem\\" in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie 16 (1882), p.285 At the encouragement of his father, who believed in an extensive education, he spent almost ten years studying law and the humanities at the Universities of Helmstedt, Frankfurt (Oder), Wittenberg, Marburg and Heidelberg, under the tutelage of some of the leading German thinkers such as Henning Arnisaeus and Leonhard Hutter. These studies were followed by the almost obligatory grand tour of Europe, including Geneva, Italy, France, the Netherlands and England. Upon his return he was appointed a judge on the Higher Regional Court (Kammergericht), in expectation that he would inherit the position of Landeshauptmann of the Altmark from his father, which he did in 1626. Supported by his brother Hempo, who was by then the war commissary of Brandenburg, the early years in this role were largely spent mitigating the impact of the 30 Years War on the region. Knesebeck‚Äôs own estates were laid waste by imperial troops in 1631. At the insistence of Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, having declined once before, he was admitted into the Privy Council in 1646. He was further appointed director of the Kammergericht in 1651, in order to push through long-needed reform of that institution. L. Noack & J√ºrgen Splett. Bio- Bibliographien: Brandenburgische Gelehrte der Fr√ºhen Neuzeit - Mark Brandenburg mit Berlin-C√∂lln 1506‚Äì1640. pp.205-07 One of the major incidents under his administration was the 1653 Landtag, a meeting of the Estates necessitated by the burdensome post-war financial demands made on them by Frederick William in part due to his drive to fund a standing army. Though Knesebeck was broadly opposed to this policy, the eventual outcome was a five- year payment plan, in exchange for increased absolutist power for the Elector, as well as greater privileges for the nobility versus the peasantry. Knesebeck died on 1 February 1658. He remained unmarried and was succeeded as Landeshauptmann by his brother Hempo.

One of the leading causes of this drastic decrease is the use of harmful pesticides, such as neonicotinoids. These chemicals, also known as neonics, are among the most commonly used pesticides. They are used extensively in agriculture, as well as in home and garden centers. However, research has shown that exposure can kill bees directly, or make them more susceptible to other impacts like disease and climate change. Overview Honey Nut Cheerios and Burt's Bees joined together in 2014 to inform people of this potentially catastrophic issue. The cereal brand has temporarily removed their mascot, Buzz, from their boxes as a way to get their message across. Honey Nut Cheerios has offered free wildflower packets to customers, claiming to have given out 1.5 billion seeds during the campaign. The seeds are supplied by the Canadian company Veseys Seeds. The campaign has been praised by advertising professionals as an example of cause marketing in which the cause is actually relevant to the firm's business, but the company's efforts have been criticized because some of the wildflowers involved are classified as invasive species in certain geographical regions. Burt's Bees has planted 5,000 wildflower seeds for every special edition #BringBacktheBees lip balm sold. Author Rhonda Fleming Hayes suggests \\"bees like flowers in blues and yellows with a shallow landing area\\". The Friends of the Earth Organization has also been an integral part of the campaign. On their website, they list many important steps readers can take to bee an active part of the solution, such as telling their local representative or keeping their garden bee-friendly. There have been widespread physical demonstrations associated with this movement, such as a swarm around the British Parliament and protests at various Lowe's stores across the U.S. and Canada selling bee-killing pesticides. According to an article published on the fact-checking website Snopes, a number of baseless rumors have circulated about the Bring Back the Bees campaign. For example: * General Mills is itself responsible for killing honeybees through its use of the herbicide glyphosate. * Veseys Seeds is owned by Monsanto. According to the Snopes article, these rumors are false. General Mills does use glyphosate, but‚Äîunlike neonicotinoids‚Äîglyphosate has minimal toxicity to honeybees.

Born in La Fayette, Illinois, Williams attended school in Galva, Illinois, though didn't graduate from high school. In 1888, he married Mabel L. Grubb, with whom he would eventually have eight children, and moved to Fairmont, Nebraska where his wife's family owned a farm. Raised a Baptist, he and his wife joined Seventh-day Adventist Church after attending a meetings held by William Byington White, president of the Nebraska Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. Becoming missionaries, they moved their family to Citronelle, Alabama, where a new congregation was successfully organized under William's leadership, before moving first to Battle Creek, Michigan in 1901, then to Franklin, Kentucky, running successful mercantile businesses in each city. In December 1903, Williams assumed management of the store at the Southern Training School (today Southern Adventist University) in Graysville, Tennessee, where he also completed his formal education, and in 1908, took over management of the Adventist-sponsored Atlanta Sanitarium. Returning to Nebraska in 1909, Williams began farming in Harlan County before becoming business manager of the Nebraska Sanitarium in Hastings and continued farming north of the city. In 1914, he and family moved back to the Grubb farm in Fairmont and became involved in community affairs, managing an American Red Cross fund drive and serving on the Fillmore County Council of Defense during World War I. A Republican, he was elected to the Nebraska House of Representatives in 1918 and reelected in 1920. As a legislator, he focused on road and farming issues and supported ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. After running unsuccessfully for nomination for Secretary of State, he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1924 and was reelected in 1926 and 1928. Williams ran for Governor in 1932, placing third in the Republican primary, and again for Lieutenant Governor in 1936, losing to incumbent Democrat Walter H. Jurgensen. He served as president of the Nebraska chapter of the Anti-Saloon League until 1936 and remained active in church activities, working for the Religious Liberty Department of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists and writing for Liberty, the church magazine. He served on the boards of numerous church institutions and, in 1942, he served as interim pastor of the Lincoln City Seventh-day Adventist Church. Williams was a member of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War and honored as a Nebraska Admiral. He was a friend and ally of the state's longtime U.S. Senator George W. Norris.

It is part of social network research and uses social network analysis to understand how various factors affect one's cognitive representation of the network (i.e. the individual's belief of who is connected to whom). Importantly, an individual's perception of the network may be different than reality. In fact, these differences between the perceived network and the actual network are the focus of many studies that seek insight into how we think about others and our relationships.  Overview  In 1987, David Krackhardt discussed the study of cognitive social structures in an article that defined the term and outlined its uses in social network research. Social structures are defined by a set of individual members and the relations between those members. The study of cognitive social structures also includes every member's understanding of the social structure. Thus, a cognitive social structure consisting of n people has n separate, and possibly distinct, representations of that social structure. Example: Alice, Bob, and Charlie are all friends. Thus, there are three separate representations of their network. If they each believe they are friends with the other two, but that the other two are not friends, then all three representations are distinct. That is, none of them agree on the structure of their friendship network. If, on the other hand, they all believed they were all friends, then they would all have the same representation of the network. Furthermore, the perceived structure of the network and the actual structure of the network may be inconsistent. By measuring every member's perception of the network, researchers can analyze the systematic errors to understand how we think about networks and what affects these perceptions. A network may consist of directed relations. A directed relation involves a sender and a receiver. For example, the relation ‚Äúgoes to for advice‚Äù is directed in that if Alice (sender) goes to Bob (receiver) for advice, it does not mean that Bob also goes to Alice for advice. The relation, \\"is a sibling of\\", on the other hand, is symmetric, not directed, because if Alice is a sibling of Bob, then Bob is necessarily a sibling of Alice.  Terminology  * Broker: A member who connects those who would otherwise be unconnected. * Centrality: Influence measured by number of connections and distance from others with high centrality ** Eigenvector centrality: How well connected an individual is to other well-connected members * Closure/Balance: Given a member who is directly connected to two others, the triad is balanced if the other two are also connected ::Alice is friends with Bob and Charlie. The triad is said to be balanced if Bob and Charlie are also friends. It is unbalanced if Bob and Charlie are not friends. * Degree: The number of direct connections ** In-degree: The number of ties directed towards the person ** Out-degree: The number of directed ties from the person to others ::Alice goes to Bob and Charlie for advice. Bob goes to Alice for advice. Alice has in-degree 1, and out-degree 2. * Geodesic Distance: The shortest path between two individuals ::Alice is friends with Bob who is friends with Charlie who is friends with David. The geodesic distance between Alice and Bob is one, between Alice and Charlie is two, and between Alice and David is three. * Homophily: How similar an individual is to those directly connected to them * Reciprocity/Mutuality: Given a directed relation from person A to person B, whether or not there is also a directed relation from person B to person A. ::Alice goes to Bob for advice. This relationship is reciprocal if Bob also goes to Alice for advice.  Analyzing Cognitive Social Structures   Ego Network Analysis  An ego network, or a local structure, consists of the individual and every member who is directly connected to that individual. For example, on social media, a user's ego network consists of the user (ego), everyone who is directly linked to that user's account (e.g. \\"friends\\" or \\"followers\\"), and the connections between those people (e.g. whether or not they are \\"friends\\" with or \\"followers\\" of each other). In an experiment, an ego network is measured by asking the participant to list everybody to whom they are directly connected, and then note which of those people are connected to each other. Thus, in an experimental setting, the ego network reflects the participant's view of their local network, and therefore may differ from another's participant's perspective.  Full Network Analysis  There are three primary methods used to examine a full cognitive social structure: slices (the individual perceptions of the full network), locally aggregated structures (the combination of each member's direct connections), and consensus structures (the network of relations that more than a certain portion of members agree on). = Slices = One way to analyze a cognitive social structure is to individually look at each ‚Äúslice‚Äù, that is, each member's perception. Biases in network perception may shift based on the individual (e.g. personality) or the position (e.g. popular, low status). Comparing slices reveals differences between individuals as well as systematic errors in perception across members. = Locally Aggregated Structures (LAS) = One approach to studying a cognitive social structure is to measure each member's direct connections (ego networks). In other words, ask each individual to report who they are related to (e.g. friends with) in the network. That is, consider the individual's own relationships. Then connect all of these local networks to form the whole network. Building a network model in this way can be achieved by asking individuals who they relate to (e.g. ‚ÄúWho do you go to for advice?‚Äù), known as a Row Dominated Locally Aggregated Structure, or who is related to them (e.g. ‚ÄúWho goes to you for advice?‚Äù), known as a Column Dominated Locally Aggregated Structure. There are two ways to combine local structures into the full locally aggregated structure. Taking the intersection of the local networks results in a network in which relations exist if both members perceive it. In a friendship network, this means that a friendship only exists if both people consider the other a friend. The union of the local networks is a structure consisting of relations that at least one involved member perceives. In a friendship network, this is equivalent to saying a friendship exists between two people if at least one of them considers the other a friend. = Consensus Structures = The consensus structure of a cognitive social structure is the network that more than a certain number of people perceive. This is accomplished by fixing a threshold such that a relation is said to exist if and only if the proportion of members who perceive that relation is greater than the threshold. For example, setting the threshold to 0.5 means that the relation between two people exists if the majority of people believe it exists. Similarly, a relation between two people does not exist if a majority of people do not perceive it.  Empirical Findings  Many species are able to represent social structures, yet humans are able to represent disproportionately large social structures (based on cortical thickness in the brain). Research suggests that this is, at least in part, due to the use of schemas. Schemas are a pre-established method of organizing and perceiving the world. Similar to a template, schemas provide a basic scaffolding that allow humans to make assumptions about a social structure without remembering every detail individually. This preserves neural resources, allowing for representation of larger structures. Some research suggests that a basic schema people utilize is based on small-world network properties. Namely, one tends to believe that their social network contains groups of people who are highly intraconnected, and that these groups, or clusters, are connected via short paths. Other work suggests that this is particularly true of one's own group, but not for others. For example, Alice likely believes that all of her friends are friends with each other, but other groups are not as connected. In addition to making network representation efficient, schemas, as well as other biases, lead to systematic errors in network perception. These errors in individual and group perceptions has been the focus of much of the research related to cognitive social structures. In research, a typical method of measuring cognitive social structures involves :(a) listing one‚Äôs direct ties, either in general or in terms of whom they‚Äôve interacted with recently, or :(b) completing a table that lists all members in the rows and columns by checking off whom everyone is connected to.  Learning Networks  Specific factors have been shown to influence how easily and how well people are able to learn new networks. As discussed above, people use schemas to represent networks. It makes sense, therefore, that structures that are consistent with these schemas are easier to learn. Specifically, behavioral research suggests that individuals are better at learning networks that group members by positive relations (e.g. \\"liking\\") and divide groups by negative relations (e.g. \\"disliking\\"), individuals are better able to learn people who are at the extremes of a hierarchy, rather than in the middle, and larger networks are easier to remember if they are balanced (if one person is friends with two others, than those two are also friends). People are also better at remembering large networks if they include kin labels (e.g. \\"Mother\\", \\"Uncle\\", \\"Cousin\\", etc.) than if they do not.  Accuracy  Many researchers compare individuals‚Äô cognitive social structures to the actual social structure in order to measure consistent errors, or biases, involved with cognitive social structures. While some research shows that individuals‚Äô representations correlate with the aggregate group's representation, there are systematic errors that occur as a result of network position and individual differences. Many researchers have studied the effects of and the perceptions of centrality, or how well connected one is within the network. Broadly, individuals tend to believe they have higher centrality (i.e. better connected within the network) and higher degree (e.g. more friends) than others believe. Furthermore, members who have low centrality, such as those who are on the periphery of the network or at the bottom of the hierarchy (unpopular, low status), tend to have more accurate representations than those who are more central (popular, high status). Several studies suggest that social network representations track overall patterns of behavior, rather than specific events. Furthermore, there appears to be a trade-off between overall accuracy and specific event accuracy: those who remember details of a specific interaction tend to have less accurate representations of overall behavior patterns, while those with more accurate pattern representations have more trouble recalling event details. This can cause issues when studying cognitive social structures because, often, the only way to determine the true social network is by observing behavior. If, however, the researchers do not sufficiently observe the network, then the observed behavior may not be representative of the overall patterns of behavior. Some research suggests that people extract these patterns of behavior by tracking the frequency of interactions, assuming that the more frequently two people interact, the more likely they are connected. This leads to the belief that people are more connected than they actually are. In accordance with balance theory, people tend to believe that the missing relation in unbalanced groups (e.g. groups of three in which two members are connected to the third but are not connected themselves) actually exists, thereby believing the triad is balanced. This is especially true when considering triads that are very close to the individual and very distant, but not for members who are intermediately far away.  Neural Findings  Research indicates that the interpersonal relationships among people shaped the evolution of human brains. Neuroimaging work has identified specific regions in the brain that aid in network representation, many of which are included in the default mode network, and track network position properties, such as eigenvector centrality, brokerage, and popularity. That is, when participants see a network member's face, they automatically retrieve information about that person's network position, suggesting that this information is important in understanding that person. Much of the research relating social networks to neural measures focuses on physical size and density of brain regions. Research shows that social network size correlates with brain volume in specific regions, including the amygdala and regions associated with the default mode network, which is thought to process information about others' thoughts and feelings.  Individual Differences  Studies on individual differences in cognitive social structures examine how individuals' traits affect their perceptions of social networks. Following are specific aspects of individuals that researchers have found influence cognitive social structures. Need for closure, which refers to one's tendency to avoid ambiguity, has been shown to correlate with the number of ties that are perceived as transitive. That is, the higher one's need for closure, the more likely they are to perceive unbalanced groups as balanced. Additionally, people with high need for closure tend to cluster people by racial similarity in their representation of social networks. Status, Power, Popularity: in real-world social networks, low-power members tend to have more accurate perceptions of social networks than high-power individuals, particularly regarding people who are distant to the perceiver. One study found that these low-power individuals with accurate network perceptions received more payoffs compared to other low-power members with less accurate perceptions. However, the benefits to low-status individuals with accurate network knowledge only held if other low-status people had worse knowledge. Similarly, in a controlled setting, participants primed with low-status then had more accurate representations of a social network, but not of a non-social network. This research suggests that one's own status is an important factor in their representation of their social networks, because high power prompts people to use heuristics, while low-power people use more systematic methods to understand the network. There has been lots of research on how people perceive their social network and the differences between these perceptions. Other individual differences measures have been suggested to influence cognitive social structures, including need for achievement, need for affiliation, and self-monitoring. However, since studies often use different types of networks (e.g. real-world organizations, friend groups, communication networks), there is not yet consensus on the effect of these differences.

Khoo Kalianwala In 1857, when Mangal Pandey rebelled against the British, the inspired 400 soldiers platoon stationed at Lahore escaped from their barracks, swam the river Ravi and reached Ajnala. When Mr. Fredric Cooper, the then Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar received the information, he ordered to put them all in a coop-like room. Here, 200 soldiers died of asphyxia and next morning the rest of them were brutally shot dead. Their dead bodies were thrown in Kalianwala Khoo in Tehsil Ajnala.  Jandiala Guru  Amritsar district is also home to India's only handicraft on UNESCO's List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The Deputy Commissioner is working to revive interest in this area through Project Virasat.  Pul Kanjri  Pul Kanjri is the historical place associated with the life of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. It was located arounded 35 Km from City Amritsar. It is 5km away from Wagah Border. This prominent place held in Amritsar during the Maharaja Ranjit Singh from 1800-1840. Pul Kanjri has a fantastic architecture with 12 doors to let the airflow all around. The golden time of this monuments ends with the partition of the Punjab, 1947.

Early years and education Cynthia M. Roberts was born on the summit of one of the highest hills of Great Barrington, Massachusetts, February 27, 1826. She lived in a humble home with poor and religious parents. Her father, Samuel Roberts, died when she was one year old. She was the youngest of a family of five children, and the young mother, felt obliged in her widowed condition to yield to the help of relatives, and place her children among friends, whose care they shared for several years. As a bright, rosy-cheeked little girl with a \\"foolish habit of making rhymes,\\" she often elicited the frowns of the elders and the laughter of her playmates. Unappreciated, she dwelt even at a young age in an atmosphere of unattainable hopes. She was always a deep thinker, wondering at the mysteries of life and death and adoring the sublimities of nature, being from childhood left much to her own ways and meditations. She became orphaned at the age of 14 while a pupil in the Emma Willard School, in Troy, New York, where she had lived with her widowed mother. As a pupil in the seminary, for three years she had looked forward to the acquirement of a liberal education. She took great delight in school compositions and she wrote in such a style as to attract the favorable notice of her instructors. About that time her eyes, always full of laughter, began to show the incipient signs of dark shadow and severe inflammation which, later became blindness. She was solicited, by the preceptress, after her mother's death to continue her studies as a \\"teacher- scholar,\\" but the state of her eyes would not permit it. Career At the age of 21, she married Fred Gorton, a prosperous paper manufacturer. Six years after, during a painful and lingering illness, she became completely blind. With the return of physical strength, her mind became active and prolific, but she to be dependent on others to transcribe her thoughts to paper. Her first prose work, The Fatal Secret, was written wholly with a pencil, but so rapidly did she do this that her hand, all unconsciously to herself, formed an almost new alphabet, unreadable except by those who had followed the transformation. That was a serious impediment. Fortunately, the typewriter became available and was hailed by her with joy, and for seventeen years, covering the greater part of her literary life, she used it with nearly as much facility and precision as those with their full sight. She published two books, her household and public duties having prevented her from preparing the manuscripts of her other productions for publication. During her long literary career, she was widely known as \\"Ida Glenwood,\\" this being her chosen pen- name. She was called \\" The Sweet Singer\\" and \\"The Blind Bard of Michigan.\\" Her first published poem appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer, the editor, Mr. Harding, having accidentally seen it in her husband's office. He encouraged her to work and in a short time, many journals both in city and country were pleased to give publicity to her contributions. She wrote many serials, stories and poems for the Detroit \\"Christian Herald\\" and other papers and periodicals. These included \\"The Fatal Secret, or a Romance of Mackinac Island,\\" \\"Kate Wynans and the Forger's Daughter,\\" \\"Ma Belle Queen,\\" \\"The Mistress of Rosedale,\\" \\"Tangled Threads,\\" \\"Black France,\\" and others. In the temperance movement, she became an earnest and efficient temperance worker, presiding at public meetings, lecturing and reciting original poems which were received by press and people with great enthusiasm. Her short career as a platform speaker began with the recitation of a poem entitled \\"Adolphus and Olivia, or a tale of Kansas.\\" Her oratorical powers were unusual, and her remarkable memory enabled her to recite for 1.5 hours a poem of historical and tragic interest. Of this Gov. Reuben Fenton said, at its second rehearsal, \\"One must conclude, after listening to 'The Blind Bard of Michigan,' that if we would find the best and deepest poetical thoughts, we must look for them in the emanations from the imprisoned soul.\\" For 20 years, Gorton lectured many times before large and enthusiastic audiences finally relinquishing her speaking engagements because of exhaustion. Becoming an expert with the typewriter, she was a prolific letter writer to \\"shut-ins,\\" who belonged to the various societies where she was a member. Her days were also full of good works, of a highly religious character. Her home was in Fenton, Michigan. Gorton died in 1894, and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery, Fenton.

Geography  As the name suggests, East Mackay is the suburb to the east of the city centre. It is flat low-lying coastal land (less than 10 metres above sea level). It is bounded by the Pioneer River to the north and the Coral Sea to the east. There is a sandy beach along the foreshore to the sea known as Town Beach. It is possible to swim there at high tide, but, as the tide goes out, extensive mudflats are revealed. The suburb is mostly used for residential purposes except for the northern part of the suburb at the mouth of the Pioneer River, which is a wetland known as the Sandfly Creek Environmental Reserve and managed by the Mackay Regional Council. The wetland serves a number of purposes, acting as a levee against coastal erosion, providing a habitat for shorebirds and other fauna, and providing a walking track for visitors.  History  Victoria Park State School opened on 1 July 1926. On 27 January 1970, the school was divided to create a separate Victoria Park State Infants School for the early years of schooling, but on 16 December 1994 the infants school was merged back into the main school.  Amenities  The Bluewater Trail which connects a number of popular recreation areas passes through East Mackay roughly following the riverside and coastline.

The majority of the plaques are housed in the Diocesan Museum of the Cathedral of Salerno, which is where the group's main namesake comes from. It is supposed the ivories originated in either Salerno and Amalfi, which both contain identified ivory workshops, however neither has been definitively linked to the plaques so the city of origin remains unknown.Eastmond, The Salerno Ivories: Objects, Histories, Contexts.

The panel's origins in a twelfth-century Sicilian or Levantine workshop has also been considered, as well as possible monastic bonds or affiliations to the Norman court. Smaller groups of the plaques and fragments of panels are currently housed in different museum collections in Europe and America, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Louvre in Paris, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest. The plaques make up one part of a broad group of ivory artifacts from the same era and region of southern Italy. These consist of collections of objects such as oliphants, bone-and-ivory boxes, chess pieces, Siculo-Arabic boxes, Italo-Byzantine ivories and the Farfa Casket.  Historical Background and Origin  Salerno Ivory Plaque depicting Cain and Abel from the Old Testament Cycle The earliest documentation of the ivories was in the inventories of the Salerno Cathedral during the early sixteenth century. A lack of further written sources causes debate over when and where the ivories were carved, who commissioned them, the arrangement of the panels, and the geographical and cultural origins of the artists. The dating of the ivories spans from the later eleventh to the mid twelfth century. The original sequence and arrangement for the ivories are unknown.Dell‚ÄôAcqua, Francesca. The Salerno Ivories: Objects, Histories, Contexts. Berlin: Gebr. Mann Verlag, pg. 211, 2016. Scholars have proposed the plaques were part of a throne, casket or door, but no evidence has been found to support this. The only documentation discussing an arrangement order for the plaques was at the death of the Archbishop of the Cathedral Lucio Sanseverino in 1623, when he requested them hung on an altar at the Cathedral. There are various possibilities for the origin of the ivories. One possibility is that they were commissioned by the Archbishop Alfanus after the consecration of the Salerno Cathedral in the last quarter of the eleventh century. Alfanus has been connected with the making of a similar cycle at Monte Cassino. Another theory is that the panels were ordered by the Archbishop of Salerno, William of Ravenna, around 1140 for the refurbishing of the Cathedral's altar, an event that was documented in 1137.  Description  A panel from the Salerno Ivories depicting the Nativity and Flight into Egypt The Salerno ivories consist of approximately forty figurative plaques, thirteen medallions, and seventeen border carving fragments.Corey, Elizabeth C. \\"The Purposeful Patron: Political Covenant In The Salerno Ivories.\\" Viator: Medieval And Renaissance Studies, Vol 40, No 2, pg. 55, 2009. The majority of the Salerno ivory panels are well-preserved and in excellent condition. They are carved in relief into flat segments of ivory.Wixom, William D. \\"Eleven Additions to the Medieval Collection.\\" The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art 66, no. 3, pg. 87-9, 1979. The plaques vary in size. Eighteen of the figurative plaques depict scenes and figures from the Old Testament, while twenty plaques and two halves of panels depict scenes from the New Testament. The Old Testament sequence average 12 cm to 24 cm wide and about 9 cm tall, while many of the New Testament plaques average 24 cm tall and 12 cm wide. Cornices and borders average from 21‚Äì25 cm long by about 7 cm wide.Kunsthistorisches Institut, Max-Planck-Institut, Iparm√ºv√©szeti M√∫zeum, The Metropolitan Museum, Francesca Dell‚ÄôAcqua, Foto Scala, Firenze/bpk, Bildagentur f√ºr Kunst, Kultur und Geschichte, Museum f√ºr Kunst and Gewerbe, pg. 329-38, 339-354. The Salerno Ivories: Objects, Histories, Contexts. Berlin: Gebr. Mann Verlag, 2015. The supporting columns are about 23 cm x 2 cm and the busts are 6 cm squared. Most of the plaques are divided into an upper half and lower half and contain two separate scenes, with a few exceptions. The plaques illustrate a comprehensive linear narrative of the life of Christ and the most important phases of his life, from his birth and infancy to his Resurrection. The Old Testament series of plaques contains a series of scenes beginning with Creation (pictured at top of page) and then recounting the stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, ending with Moses Receiving the Laws. Unlike other late medieval works where episodes from the Old and New Testaments were illustrated side by side, the two Testaments are separate and not conjunct in the Salerno Ivories. Each plaque is carved in high relief, with figures, objects and animals in the scene appearing to come out of the ivory panel. Some of the different figures have glass eyes still intact in colors like blue, black or red.Museo Diocesano The Salerno Ivories: Objects, Histories, Contexts. Berlin: Gebr. Mann Verlag, pgs. 28-54, 355; 2015. Each scene is bordered around the edges of the ivory and the entire series has detached decorative cornices, borders and colonnettes. The cornices and borders contain inhabited scrolls, plants and cornucopias, while the colonnettes contain a decorative twisting column. There are also small square-and-circle bust portraits of different Apostles and Donors. Scholars use manuscript illustrations and contemporary ivory monuments as sources for the iconography of the Salerno Ivories. These include a sixth- century manuscript called the Cotton Genesis as well as Middle Byzantine Octateuch manuscripts, which lend traditions of Old Testament illustrations and stylistic influences to the Salerno Ivories. Another sizable group of ivories called the Grado Chair series were used as a model for several of the New Testament scenes.  Significance  The Ivories are primarily understood as Christian religious works, but some scholars have also proposed they held a political significance as well. Since there are no concrete facts to support this, just theories and observations, the truth of the ivories' purpose remains unknown.

The episode was written by Matthew Negrete and Channing Powell, and directed by Rosemary Rodriguez. The combined attack on Negan and the Saviors' compound has left the entire complex surrounded by a large horde of walkers, preventing the Saviors from leaving or entering the Sanctuary. The combined forces of Alexandria, the Hilltop and the Kingdom split up to deal with other Savior outposts, using information provided by Dwight. This episode marks the return of Morales (Juan Pareja), who was last seen in the first season episode \\"Wildfire\\", and has the longest period of absence than any other character on The Walking Dead; having been absent for six seasons and 95 episodes. The recurring characters Francine (Dahlia Legault), Andy (Jeremy Palko) and Freddie (Brett Gentile) make their final appearances after being killed by the Saviors. Plot Morgan (Lennie James), Tara (Alanna Masterson) and Jesus (Tom Payne) lead a silent coordinated surprise attack on the same radio telescope observatory they had previously cleared of Saviors; however, Morgan along with Andy (Jeremy Palko) and Freddie (Brett Gentile), appear to be gunned down. Tara and Jesus find a man cowering in a closet claimed to be a worker from the Sanctuary, and while Tara is eager to kill him, Jesus suggests they keep him alive. However, the man turns on them, threatening to shoot Jesus. Tara and Jesus overpower him and tie him up. They later find the remaining Saviors who voluntarily drop their guns. Morgan, who was only stunned unconscious in the attack, vengefully kills any remaining Saviors on his way out and is stopped by Jesus from killing the ones they have taken captive. King Ezekiel (Khary Payton) and Carol (Melissa McBride) command their forces to a Savior pharmacy lab. With only one Savior left, they try to shoot him but only wound him, giving the guard the chance to set off a smoke bomb and unleash walkers that had been trapped within the building. Ezekiel's group readily dispatches them, but the guard has escaped and they fear he might reach a nearby Savior stronghold to warn them. They find a trail of blood and surmise he is moving slowly; they also discover a walker with its skin ripped off and Ezekiel becomes curious as to its fate. They eventually catch up with the man and Shiva the tiger mauls the man to death. Ezekiel enthusiastically rallies his troops to take the nearby Savior stronghold, despite the fact the Saviors know they are coming. Aaron (Ross Marquand) and his partner Eric (Jordan Woods-Robinson) lead the assault on a warehouse where many Saviors are holed up. Francine (Dahlia Legault) dies of a shot in the chest during the shooting. When some of the Saviors attempt to flank them, Eric takes a risky move to move around cover and stop them. The firefight is protracted and the Saviors realize too late that its goal was to wait out the deaths of the first victims to reanimate into walkers, as to attack the remaining Saviors within. As the fight dies down, Aaron finds Eric had been shot in the stomach and races him to safety. Using Aaron's distraction, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and Daryl (Norman Reedus) sneak into a town hall, where Dwight's info said that heavy machine guns are hidden; Rick desires to capture these to prevent the Saviors using them to clear the walker horde. Finding the place empty, the two split up. Rick encounters one man who gets into a fight, seemingly protecting a specific door. Rick impales him on a shelf bracket and then opens the door, only to find a sleeping infant, and Rick becomes devastated. He is distracted enough by his act that he is easily caught at gunpoint by Morales (Juan Pareja), one of the first survivors Rick met at Atlanta, and who is now loyal to the Saviors.

The episode was written by Matthew Negrete and Channing Powell, and directed by Greg Nicotero. The episode continues to follow the different groups in their attack against several Savior outposts as well as the aftermath. It also features the final appearances of Morales (Juan Pareja) and Eric Raleigh (Jordan Woods-Robinson). Eric's death was partially adapted from Issue #118 of the comic book series. Plot Inside the Savior office outpost, Morales (Juan Pareja), a former member of Rick's (Andrew Lincoln) group, holds Rick at gunpoint while Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Rick search for a cache of heavy machine guns belonging to the Saviors. Rick and Morales discuss at length their tribulations since they parted; Morales lost his family while Rick admits he lost many. Morales swears his loyalty to Negan and insists that Rick is a \\"monster\\" for what he's done, but Rick tries to appeal to him. Suddenly, Daryl appears and kills Morales without any remorse despite having recognized him. Finding no guns elsewhere, the two take Gracie, the infant Rick found earlier, and leave to join with Aaron (Ross Marquand)'s forces. Outside the stronghold, Aaron's forces have kept the Saviors confined, forcing them to deal with the reanimation of their dead colleagues rather than their attackers. Aaron drags his wounded partner Eric (Jordan Woods-Robinson) away from battle. Eric insists that Aaron leaves him behind and gives him a final kiss before Aaron returns to the battle. Rick and Daryl arrive shortly to help deal with the remaining Saviors. Aaron goes back to where he left Eric and finds a re-animated Eric walking off into the woods. Aaron, in a state of shock, is pulled back in and volunteers to take Gracie back to the Hilltop. One Savior, attempting to flee, quickly confesses that the guns had been transported to a new location. In response, Daryl kills the Savior, with Rick offering no attempt to stop him, before they set out. At the Hilltop, Gregory (Xander Berkeley) returns and begs to be let back in to Maggie (Lauren Cohan), but she demands that he tells her what happened at the Sanctuary, seeing that he is driving the car assigned to Father Gabriel. Gregory falsely claims that he doesn't know who Gabriel is and says he was negotiating with Negan, trying to arrange for the best for the Hilltop. While Maggie is distrustful, she lets him in as she comments Gregory isn't worth killing. Meanwhile, Morgan Jones (Lennie James), Jesus (Tom Payne), and Tara (Alanna Masterson) lead a group of captive Saviors along a road. One Savior, Jared (Joshua Mikel), who shot Morgan's prot√©g√© Benjamin, taunts Morgan, leading Morgan to turn his gun onto him. Just as Jesus tries to intervene a horde of walkers appears, allowing some of the Saviors (including Jared) to escape. Morgan attempts to give chase and fires on the escapees, killing one, before Jesus and Tara tackle him. Morgan and Jesus fight about how to handle the remaining Saviors, before Tara breaks them up. Morgan walks away. Jesus and Tara deliver the remaining prisoners to the Hilltop. Gregory attempts to discourage them from keeping the hostiles there. Maggie, though cautious of holding the prisoners, refuses to listen to Gregory. Elsewhere, Carol (Melissa McBride) and King Ezekiel (Khary Payton) lead their army against a nearby Savior outpost. They are victorious with no apparent losses, but as they revel in their win, some hiding Saviors open fire on them with heavy machine guns, the same guns Rick had been looking for. Many of the Kingdom forces are felled, with many rushing to protect Ezekiel. Reception Critical reception \\"Monsters\\" received mixed reviews from critics, with the action sequences and the deaths of Morales and Eric Raleigh being the subjects of praise, while it was criticized for its lack of impact on the season's overall story. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 56% with an average rating of 6.23 out of 10, based on 25 reviews. The site's consensus reads: Despite featuring significant deaths and action sequences, \\"Monsters\\" struggles to make meaningful progress in the season's overall story. Eric Kain of Forbes praised the episode, calling it the best of the season giving some ‚Äúdecent fight scenes and shoot-outs and raising the tension up a notch.‚Äù Kelly Lawler of USA Today had a less favorable review of the episode, criticizing the rationality and reasoning with the characters and their actions, saying ‚ÄúSunday's episode, \\"Monsters,\\" and last week's \\"The Damned\\" tried to reckon with the rash moves the series has made as of late, without much success. Both episodes return to the series' omnipresent theme of moral gray areas. Down to its on-the-nose title, this week's episode asks, \\"Who are the monsters now?\\" But The Walking Dead has asked that question many, many times, and with much better character work than the surface-level stuff done on Sunday.‚Äù She did, however, express hope in the cliffhanger, saying ‚ÄúHopefully, the cliffhanger ending means next week's episode will move on because presenting the \\"all out war\\" from this perspective isn't working out too well so far.‚Äù Ratings The episode averaged a 3.8 rating among adults 18-49, and had a viewership of 8.52 million viewers, slightly down from the previous episode.

Plot  Kannan is an idealistic police officer whose sense of duty transcends family ties and normal human sentiment. His loyalty to duty extends to making sure his friends and relatives, as well as his superiors, are taken into account of justice. He overcomes cognitive dissonance and performs his duty to truth and justice, even when that means arresting loved ones. At a pivotal moment of the film, he books his own beloved when he discovers her guilty of theft. The film ends with the reunion of the lovers. But Kannan's beloved, having given away her eyesight to him, enters prison as an atonement for the crime she committed early in her life.  Cast  ;Male cast * S. S.

In trying to do too many things at the same time, Rajendran has taken upon himself more than he could have handled.\\" T. M.

Early career Michael was born into the Ders branch of the gens (clan) B≈ë, which originated from Somogy County, and was one of the ancient ethnic Hungarian kindreds which had participated in the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in late 9th century. His younger brother was Peter the Toothed. Through their unidentified paternal aunt (a sister of their father Stephen), Michael and Peter were related to the gens Monoszl√≥ and its influential contemporary members, brothers Egyed, Gregory and Peter. As contemporary sources frequently referred to him with the prefix \\"magister\\", Michael studied canon law. In 1270, he was a notary in the court of King Stephen V. It is also possible that he served as archdeacon of √ìzd since 1277. Due to the influence of his cousin, Peter Monoszl√≥, Bishop of Transylvania, Michael was elected Grand Provost by the Transylvanian Chapter in 1287, holding the position until 1296. Meanwhile, his brother Peter B≈ë became Count of the Sz√©kelys around 1294. In December 1294, Egyed Monoszl√≥ donated three villages of the Atyina (today Voƒáin, Croatia) lordship to the B≈ë brothers, entrusting the P√©cs Chapter to contribute his instruction. The land donation was confirmed by Andrew III on 9 January 1295. Egyed Monoszl√≥ made his first will and testament in 1298, when formally adopted his maternal relatives (cousins) Michael and Peter. Egyed donated Darn√≥c Castle (today Slatinski Drenovac, Croatia) to them, however both Michael and Peter predeceased him. Prelate After the death of his predecessor John on 13 October 1295, who supported the Angevins' claim to the Hungarian and Croatian thrones, Michael B≈ë, a confidant of King Andrew III was elected Bishop of Zagreb. He first appeared in that capacity in 1296. His election was confirmed by Pope Boniface VIII on 20 January 1297. In the same time, Michael became chancellor (mentioned in 1297) in the court of Andrew's uncle Albertino Morosini, Duke of Slavonia, in addition to his titles of isp√°n of Garics (Podgaric) and Gerzence (Gare≈°nica) lordships, held both from 1297 until 1303. However, practically, those territories were occupied by the powerful K≈ëszegi family since the 1280s, neglecting the diocese's legal claims. Albertino Morosini and Michael B≈ë represented the royal power in the province of Slavonia against the increasingly powerful oligarchs (especially, the K≈ëszegis) and the pro-Angevin baronial groups. The new Bishop removed and expelled his predecessor's confidants from the town and the chapter. Michael concluded a contract with the Baboniƒái to fought against the K≈ëszegis, whose troops even plundered and devastated the territory of the Diocese of Zagreb, while looted its treasures. Michael led numerous royal campaigns against the K≈ëszegis' territory. Its overlord Henry K≈ëszegi concluded a peace with the Bishop by the end of 1297 and handed over the forts of Gerzence and Garics to the diocese, which suffered from the endless warfare. Under such conditions, Michael financially supported the Chapter of ƒåazma (Cs√°zma) from his own wealth. After the Diet of 1298, he remained in the royal court and never visited his diocese or the Croatian province again. Michael's seal from 1299 preserved the first art depiction of the Zagreb Cathedral. Andrew III died on 14 January 1301. Following that Michael became one of the first partisans of Charles of Anjou beside Archbishop-elect Gregory Bicskei, while majority of the prelates supported the claims of the Bohemian prince Wenceslaus. As a skilled notary and canonist, he help the diplomatic work of papal legate Niccolo Boccasini, who tried to persuade the secular barons to support Charles' claim against the other pretenders. In September 1302, Michael was present, when Charles' general Stephen Cs√°k laid siege to Buda, the capital of Wenceslaus' realm, but Ivan K≈ëszegi relieved the siege. Pope Boniface, who regarded Hungary as a fief of the Holy See declared Charles the lawful king of Hungary on 31 May 1303. The papal bull was annunciated in Hungary by Michael B≈ë and Stephen, the new Archbishop of Kalocsa. His ally, Archbishop-elect Gregory Bicskei was murdered in Anagni on 7 September 1303 by soldiers whom Philip IV of France had sent to Italy to capture Pope Boniface, who also died in the next month. Michael's former colleague Niccolo Boccasini was elected as Pope Benedict XI. On 4 November 1303, he appointed Michael as Archbishop of Esztergom, while characterizing his friend as \\"noble, scholar, fine and diligent\\". On 21 March 1304, the Pope informed Benedict R√°d, Bishop of Veszpr√©m that he had sent the pallium to Michael, after the receipt of his oath of loyalty. On 24 August 1304, Michael styled himself as \\"Archbishop appointed from the God's grace\\" (his last appearance as a living person). Only a few information has been preserved during his brief primacy; on 4 February he lifted clergyman Bede from the excommunication at the Pope's instruction, while excommunicated Nicholas, son of Felician, a canon of Esztergom on 15 May, who unlawfully usurped the goods of the Szepes Provostry (today Spi≈°sk√° Kapitula in Slovakia). In the summer of 1304, the Bohemian army invaded Upper Hungary and encamped at P√°rk√°ny (present-day ≈†t√∫rovo in Slovakia). There Wenceslaus II of Bohemia called upon Michael to crown his namesake son as King of Hungary, but the Archbishop refused the threat. Following that the Bohemian troops stormed Esztergom and looted its treasury, in addition to the destruction of diplomas and holy relics. Michael fled his archbishopric seat for Pressburg (today Bratislava, Slovakia), where he died soon. On 1 November 1304, Theophilus, Provost of Esztergom already referred to him as a deceased person. Michael was buried in the St. Martin's Cathedral.

History The mosque was built in 1917 following a dispute between local Hindus and Muslims regarding ownership of a 3 marla site after a Muslim had offered prayer on the vacant site, upsetting local Hindus. Both communities then expressed a wish to build their house of worship there. The matter was submitted to British colonial authorities, who decided to dispatch a judge to the site in order to determine to which community the disputed plot would belong. A Muslim lawyer advised his community to build a mosque at the site before the judge arrived, so that ownership of the site would be declared in their favour as British authorities had pledged not to disturb religious sites. Under the leadership of a local wrestler named Gama Pehalwan, Muslims volunteers are said to have gathered after the evening Isha prayer, in order to build the mosque. The mosque reportedly was complete by the morning Fajr prayer, and the judge then ruled in favour of the Muslim community.

Hinojosa reinforced this image by staging social provocations scandalizing both iconic intellectuals like Valle-Inclanduring a homage reception to Valle-Inclan Hinojosa was reading fake telegram messages urging to kill the writer; other ones were in scatological tone, e.g. claiming that \\"la condesa de Noailles menstr√∫a como una vaca\\", S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-29 and plain rural Andalusians; he was willingly assisted by acquaintances like Dal√≠ and his new female partner Gala.Dali and Gala, driven across Andalusia in Hinojosa‚Äôs Chrysler cabrio, paraded half-naked in the countryside, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 187; see also Giovanni Allegra, Trent'anni di avanguardia spagnola: da Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna a Juan-Eduardo Cirlot, Jaca 1987, , p. 165 typical surrealist imagery Hinojosa's relations with his avant-garde group of companions remained ambiguous.

One painting could have been saved when Dal√≠, enraged about Hinojosa‚Äôs bourgeoisie turn, asked him to allow allegedly minor corrections to his portrait. Hinojosa returned the painting, never to see it back. The final fate of the painting (never reproduced) is not known; Dal√≠‚Äôs sketch of Hinojosa, often reproduced, is another work. S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-52 Literary critique either ignored him or belittled him.Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 192 It is not clear whether the complex setting contributed to the violent and apocalyptic tone of Hinojosa's last poetic volume, to be published in 1930, withdrawn from print and issued in early 1931. It turned out to be his farewell to belles-letres; according to some the poet decided to dump literature,final motives for his decision are not clear and there are different theories in circulation. One is that Hinojosa got embittered by indifference and mockery. Another is that he gave in to pressure of Ana Fre√ºller. One more is that bored with his surrealist caprice he returned to his usual bourgeoisie habits, see e.g. S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 2014, p. 188, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 192 \\"commit literary suicide\\" and not to look back.Alfonso S√°nchez Rodriguez, Jos√© Mar√≠a Hinojosa y la Calavera de Rimbaud, [in:] Clar√≠n 04.06.08, available here Works La Rosa de Los Vientos, 1927 Hinojosa penned around 200 poems, mostly short and some very short ones; short prose is down to 14 texts evading typical categorization, while theatrical and novelist attempts did not survive until today.they include a theatric piece El aviador y el buzo and a novel El Castillo de mi cuerpo All works were written between 1923 and 1930; during his lifetime they were published in 6 limited- circulation volumes and few periodicals. His literary production is considered a curve, from early juvenile works to surrealist climax and a final descent.Baena 2005, p. 174 Another scholar singles out 4 phases: descriptive, transitory, autobiographical and catastrophic.S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 4-95 Early poems, from these printed in Ambos to Poema del Campo (1925),detailed discussion in S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, pp. 4-5 to 4-22 are anchored in rural myths and set in capacity perceptive of an unspecified territory, largely bucolic and lyrical.

The largely descriptive tone gave way to dominant lyrical expression and the monothematic perspective was replaced with a variety of themes, often organized around the motive of exploration. \\"Est√©tica purista\\" was partially substituted by oneiric and surrealist approach, not clear yet already visible, and the entire volume was distinctively more expressive.Francisco Chica, Jos√© Mar√≠a Hinojosa en el horizonte renovador de los a√±os 20: filias y fobias, [in:] Julio Neira, Almoraima Gonz√°lez (eds.), Escondido en la luz, M√°laga 2005, , p. 67 La Rosa de los Vientos (1927),detailed discussin in S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, pp. 4-44 to 4-64 published again in M√°laga, was a small collection of just 19 poems; they focused upon imaginary journeys to exotic locationslike the Amazon, Himalayas or Cape Horn and to the inner self. Providing a discourse on space, mystery, and wilderness the volume offered frequent references to ancient as well as popular culture and introduced heterodox erotic motives. Stylistically at times very sophisticated, blending various rhyme orders and syllable types, it is described as a mix of Hispanic Ultra, French surrealism and Chilean creationism.S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 4-51 La Flor de California, 1928 Two volumes from 1928 are thought to be the most mature of Hinojosa's works. Orillas de la luzdetailed discussin in S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, pp. 4-65 to 4-91 contained mostly poems saturated with eroticism, its main theme.according to scholars, his eroticism was flavored with disappointments, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 190 They were, to a large extent, within the surrealist framework, featuring its trademark motives like mutilations and fragmented body parts; the fact that this poetry retained classic metrum is thought to be demonstrative of Hinojosa's synthetic ambitions.S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 4-82 La Flor de Californ√≠a,the title was intentionally mis-spelled, reportedly to enforce the rhyme between \\"Californ√≠a‚Äù and the author‚Äôs name, Jos√© Mar√≠a, Rattray 2004, p. 35 considered the first surrealist work in Spain,Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 191; some consider it the only surrealist book published in Spain, Geoffrey Connell (ed.), Spanish Poetry of the Grupo Po√©tico de 1927, Oxford 1977, , p. 18 is his sole prosaic volume; it contains seven dream narratives and seven oneiric texts; the former retain some bizarre linear coherence, while the latter come close to so-called automatic writing.one author claims Hinojose wrote the same way as Mir√≥ painted, Rattray 2004, p. 38 and another note ‚ÄûMir√≥esque‚Äù style of writing, Matilde de Moreno Escobar, La sangre en libertad: una reelaboraci√≥n surrealista del petrarquismo, [in:] Jaume Pont (ed.), Surrealismo y literatura en Espa√±a, Lleida 2001, , pp. 171-180 The prose explores typical surrealist imagery:however, some scholars claim Hinojosa's surrealism contained also author-specific motives and threads, e.g. these of travelling, childlike antics and animals, Rattray 2004, p. 41 antireligious motives,anti-religious threads though not dominant or omnipresent, are fairly frequent in late Hinojosa volumes.

For Hinojosa \\"his depictions of eroticism tend to be framed within the context of explicit blasphemy, and unconsciously or not, point to his underlying Catholic guilt\\" - Rattray 2004, p. 47. Others note that in La Flor \\"phallic and masturbatory meaning of the fingers/doves in Hinojosa‚Äôs narration would commune better with Venus than with the Holy Ghost, and the narration denounces the anti-human demands religion puts upon the flesh, causing the split between the body and the spirit\\"; examples are \\"eroticized version of Christ\\", constant blend of religious themes in erotic and sensual mode, pope who \\"amused himself with a sexual toy\\" or bleeding bodies representing religion violating humans, Candelas Gala, Creative cognition and the cultural panorama of twentieth-century Spain, New York 2014, , especially the chapter Creative Convulsion: Jos√© Mar√≠a Hinojosa and La Flor de Californ√≠a. According to some scholars Hinojosa edited Manifiesto contra los instituciones del Dios, patria y familia, Lucie Personneaux-Conesa, Histoire et historiographie du surr√©alisme espagnol, [in:] M√©lusine XI (1990), pp. 137, though others tend to doubt it, S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-24 black humor, objective chance and subterranean dream-worlds, containing also a series of apocalyptic visions.Rattray 2004, pp. 35-36 Strictly auto- biographical in terms of perspective, it is viewed as an expression of his own identity in an increasingly desperate pursuit of fulfillment.detailed discussin in S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, pp. 4-92 to 4-120 La Sangre en Libertad (1931)the volume contained poems written mostly in 1929; they were originally to be printed in early 1930, but Hinojosa withdrew the pre-prepared book from the publisher. He then changed his mind and opted for publication; the volume saw light in January 1931, S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 4-121 was very much a repetition of La Flor but brought to extremes, with new levels of anti- religious ridicule,reportedly the book was the expression of \\"fury against humanity for having invented religion\\", Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 193 sexual references, motives of violence and apocalyptic scenery.Rattray 2004, p. 35 Autobiographic features were embroiled in catastrophic premonitions;most poems are written in first person plural, for the first time used by Hinojosa stylistically the volume shows an evolution towards free verseS√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 4-138 and far-reaching formal linguistic experiments.S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 4-145 From iconoclast to Carlist kolkhoz in propaganda Until the early 1930s Hinojosa did not engage in politics, though his literary stand ‚Äì especially anti-religious threads, but also social provocations aimed against perceived bourgeoisie mentality ‚Äì was clearly suggesting left-wing preferences;some authors refer to him as \\"clearly the man of the left\\", S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 2014, p. 187 reportedly he also considered collectivization of family estates and might have visited the USSR to gain familiarity with the Soviet scheme.Neira Jim√©nez 2005, p. 79, S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-34. Reportedly Hinojosa has even convinced own father to collectivize one of the estates, but the experiment turned into a failure His later about-face and engagement in right-wing politics remain a mystery and have not been satisfactorily explained. Some scholars speculate that the USSR journey commenced the change.Hinojosa returned from the USSR entirely disappointed and claimed he had been offered nothing but lies, fakes, and pre- staged demonstrations, S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-39, also Ruiz Gisbert 2007, pp. 189-190 Others note that getting engaged in family business, for decades plagued by rural strikes and social tension,already in 1919 Salvador Hinojosa was featured in the press as fighting the striking rural workers, La Uni√≥n Ilustrada 11.12.19, available here might have also led to his transformation. It is underlined that a love affair with Ana Fre√ºller, apart from being an aviation pioneer a fairly typical wealthy girl who loathed his poetry, might have contributed to this shift in political preference.for their complex relationship see e.g. Ruiz Gisbert 2007, pp. 195-196 It is not clear whether the ambiguous stance of Hinojosa's artistic companions convinced him that he belonged to another world and caused him to overreact.however, Hinojosa did not break with his literary circle entirely, e.g. maintaining relations with Altoaguirre and Prados, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 194 Finally, some claimed that his surrealism was merely the caprice of a bourgeoisie se√±orito,Neira Jim√©nez 2005, p. 80 opinion shared also by a few scholars.one scholar, though very sympathetic towards Hinojosa and writing with no venom and disdain typical for his surrealist friends, sort of endorsed their view suggesting ‚Äûlet‚Äôs not assume a tight knot between life and literature‚Äù of Hinojosa, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 194 Lamami√© de Clairac Hinojosa's biographers either claim that he started to embrace a right-wing mindset after 1928Ruiz Gisbert 2007, pp. 189-90 or that the rupture took place sometime between 1925 and 1930.Neira Jim√©nez 2005, p. 80 He was already highly skeptical ‚Äì though not militantly averse yet ‚Äì when the Republic was declared in 1931.S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-55 In unclear circumstances he assumed the post of juez municipal in Campillos,S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-56 the job which might have exposed him to cases of social violence. Starting July he was recorded as engaged in the establishment of a provincial landholders‚Äô organization; later that year he became secretary of the newly emergent Federaci√≥n Provincial de Sindicatos Agr√≠colas de M√°lagaRuiz Gisbert 2007, p. 195, S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-58 and started to write agriculture-centred and conservatism-flavored articles in the local La Uni√≥n Mercantil.between 1931 and 1936 Hinojose published 150 articles in La Uni√≥n Mercantil, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 194.

Jos√© Mar√≠a Lamami√© de Clairac, a landholder and a friend of his father, was at the time combining syndicate activity in agrarian groupings with political engagement in Carlism; it was him who convinced Hinojosa to follow suit.S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-59 Since January 1932 he was taking part in Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista gatherings;S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, pp. 2-59 to 2-60 in July 1932 he was already recorded delivering a lecture which hailed Catholic virtues of patriotic women, who bravely confronted renegade liberalism,S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-60 and in early August he organized Carlist meetings in M√°laga himself.S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-61 He resigned the juez municipal post.La Epoca 20.10.32, available here Gaining recognition in nationwide Traditionalist pressEl Siglo Futuro 20.06.32, available here Hinojosa was getting identified as a belligerent \\"derechista‚Äù by the authorities; though he had nothing to do with Sanjurjada, in its aftermath he was detained and spent 2 weeks in a local prison, locked up with other Andalusian Carlists genuinely involved in the coup.S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-61, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 194 The experience has only exacerbated his militancy.Neira 1979, pp. 33-34 Between Carlism and Agrarism Carlist standard After his release from jail in late 1932, Hinojosa continued organizing Carlist gatherings across the province.S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 2-61 In early 1933, he emerged among the most active Traditionalists in the area together with Arauz de Robles.ABC 23.03.33, available here In March he rose to the jefe of the local organization; in numerous addresses he saluted Carlist heroes, pledged to liberate Spain from a Liberal-Marxist revolution, and paid homage to Sanjurjo, who gallantly sacrificed himself for Spain; some addresses contained thinly veiled anti-Republican tones.e.g. he called to sustain \\"great Spanish race united in its ecumenic spirit and poised to triumph, when sun will shine dispersing the haze and mist of the Republic\\", El Siglo Futuro 22.03.33, available here In parallel Hinojosa hectically worked to build agrarian syndicates through meetings, speeches, and writings,S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, pp. 2-63 to 2-66 and as a Carlist representative he animated the M√°laga branch of Acci√≥n Popular.ABC 13.07.33, available here He represented all 3 groupings standing on broad right-wing alliance ticket during the 1933 electoral campaign; some papers referred to him as a Carlist,La Vanguardia 23.11.33, available here, ABC 23.11.33, available here some as AgrarianABC 22.11.33, available here and some as a candidate of AP; scholars name him a Carlist.Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931‚Äì1939, Cambridge 2008, , p. 50 With 21,662 votes he failed to make it to the Cortes during the inconclusive first round and withdrew shortly before the second one.Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 195, El Siglo Futuro 04.12.33, available here He commenced the year of 1934 as a freshly appointed member of the board of Editorial Tradicionalista,El Siglo Futuro 12.12.33, available here a new publishing house intended as an engine of Carlist propaganda.Blinkhorn 2008, p. 133 From early 1934, there is no more information on Hinojosa's Carlist engagements.

However, another study claims the military did prepare the rising jointly with civilian representatives; they note also that when rebel troops briefly took control of the city centre on late afternoon July 18, young civilians were distributing food and water to the soldiers, Antonio Nadal, M√°laga, 18 de julio 1936, [in:] J√°bega 21 (1978), pp. 28-39 and together with his father and brother went into hiding the following day.

Following the Nationalist conquest of M√°laga the remnants were exhumed and Salvador Hinojosa was recognized thanks to a handkerchief in his pocket; it was assumed that two mostly decomposed corpses of young males next to his body were these of Francisco and Jos√© Mar√≠a.Neira 1983, p. 29 Reception and legacy Alberti, 1960s Hinojosa's writings went unnoticed, save for a limited avant-garde audience.Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 188 Critics remained mostly indifferent;Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 184 only few noted \\"excessive originality\\".Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 186 A handful of reviews following the 1928 volumes denigrated the author; some dubbed his poetry \\"entelequia\\", others ridiculed \\"se√±orito andaluz\\" and noted that \\"having two cars does not allow too much\\".Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 192 Following his death his works were almost completely forgotten,S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 2014, p. 181 as to both sides of the war he was an \\"inconvenient dead\\".Jos√© Mar√≠a Hinojosa Lasarte: Tradici√≥n pol√≠tica y vanguardia art√≠stica, [in:] El Matiner Carl√≠ service 20.08.10, available here For the Republicans his life and death made a dangerously symmetrical parallelism to those of Lorca and might have harmed the exaltation of Lorca's fate as anti-Francoist cause c√©l√®bre.Neira Jim√©nez 2005, p. 81. Another author notes that \\"si se hubiera tratado de un poeta exiliado, o ca√≠do en zona differente, no es aventurado afirmar que otro gallo le cantar√≠a a su recuerco literario\\", opinion referred after S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p.

According to Alberti Hinojosa \\"ca√≠do bajo las balas de sus propios campesinos\\"; according to Manuel Altolaguirre at \\"uno de los m√≠tines en que [Hinojosa] iba a contradecirse a s√≠ mismo delante de los trabajadores explotados de sus propias tierras, [where] fue v√≠ctima de un sangriento mot√≠n que le cost√≥ la vida\\". Some scholars claim that the fact that both versions dominated for so long is itself indicative, S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 2014, p. 181. Some authors claimed that Hinojosa joined Falange, Vittorio Bodini (ed.), I poeti surrealisti spagnoli, Torino 1963, p. CXXXVI and some denied knowing him.the case of Jos√© Bergam√≠n, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 197 For the Nationalists, who consistently denied the existence of Spanish surrealism,Neira Jim√©nez 2005, p. 80 his iconoclastic poetry made him ineligible for a martyr.S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 2014, p. 184 The exiled and Spain- based historians of literature alike either ignored HinojosaAngel del R√≠o in chapter Ultra√≠smo, vanguardia, nueva poes√≠a does not mention Hinojosa, Angel del R√≠o, Historia de la literatura espa√±ola, New York 1948 or relegated him to footnotes,Max Aub notes that Hinojosa \\"died too early for his surrealism to produce an important work\\", Max Aub, Manual de historia de la literatura espa√±ola, Mexico 1966, p. 314 though very sporadically some poems appeared in anthologiessingle Hinojosa poems were published in a 1947 Santiago de Chile anthology and a 1962 M√°laga anthology, referred after S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. I-12, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 197 and his name was mentioned in the press a few times.in the Francoist press Hinojosa was noted not for his surrealist poetry but rather for his engagement in Litoral, compare La Vanguardia 20.01.60, available here or ABC 20.04.69, available here In 1974 Hinojosa's cousin Baltasar Pe√±a took advantage of his position in the Diputaci√≥n de M√°laga to finance a re-edition of selected works;Neira Jim√©nez 2005, p. 82, S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 2014, pp. 176, 178 some press notes followed up noting a \\"deformaci√≥n\\" of contemporary literatureLa Vanguardia 03.10.74, available here yet others insisted not to \\"desorbitar la importancia\\".Jos√© Mar√≠a Diez Bourque, Historia de la literatura espa√±ola, Madrid 1974, p. 51. Editor of a 1976 anthology was anxious about anticipated criticism and noted that Hinojosa can be excluded, referred after S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, pp. I-16, I-17 In 1977 Julio Neira launched a campaign to revindicate Hinojosa, crowned with a 1981 PhD dissertation;Julio Neira Jim√©nez, Jos√© Mar√≠a Hinojosa. Vida y obra [PhD thesis Universidad de Extremadura], C√°ceres 1981 a 1983 re-edition of 2 volumes of Litoral contributed to the process. In the 1980s Hinojosa was gradually making his way into encyclopedias, periodicals, textbooks etc.S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, pp. I-19 to I-22 and 1995 brought another PhD thesis.Alfonso S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez, La poes√≠a de Jos√© Mar√≠a Hinojosa [PhD thesis Universitat de Lleida], L√©rida 1995; the following one was Carmen D√≠az Margarit, El surrealismo en \\"La flor de California\\" de Jos√© Mar√≠a Hinojosa, Madrid 2003, Since then his presence in history of literature is considered obligatory,\\"no cabe enganarse sobre su importancia\\" of a \\"minor poet\\", referred after S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 2014, p. 178. The 1993 work of Pedraza and Rodriguez is credited for transferring Hinojosa from footnotes to the main text of literature history books, Felipe B. Pedraza, Milagros Rodr√≠guez C√°ceres, Manual Manuel de historia de literatura espanola, vol. XI, Pamplona 1993, pp. 310-315 based mostly on his presumed status of the first Spanish surrealist;de Lama 1997, p. 433, S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. 0-4; Neira claims that Hinojosa and not Larrea was the first Spanish surrealist and his 1924 Sue√±os was the first Spanish surrealist poem, S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 1995, p. I-21 However, in some cases he is denied membership in Generaci√≥n del 27.in 1999 Centro Cultural Generaci√≥n del 27 ignored Hinojosa during a conference commemorating the group, which in turn triggered protest letters, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 197. Many manuals do not list Hinojosa as a member of Generation 27 or as a surrealist, compare e.g. a textbook La poes√≠a surrealista en Espa√±a. La Generaci√≥n d 1927: caracter√≠sticas generales, available here In 1998 he was declared hijo predilecto by M√°laga province,Jos√© Mar√≠a Hinojosa Lasarte: Tradici√≥n pol√≠tica y vanguardia art√≠stica, [in:] El Matiner Carl√≠ service 20.08.10, available here the 2004 birth centenary produced several publications and events,including streets and plazas named after him and a 2012 study (instead of the typical \\"forgotten poet\\")S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 2014, p. 174 referred already to \\"a well-known Spanish poet\\".cover text in Jose Maria Hinojosa, Black Tulips: The Selected Poems of Jose Maria Hinojosa, translated by Mark Statman, New Orleans 2012, In 2014 he was dedicated a literary work.Alfonso S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez, El buzo y la aviadora, M√°laga 2014, . This theatrical piece is set up in prison, during the period preceding Hinojosa‚Äôs execution; he travels back in time, meeting his surrealist friends and re- enacting their common feasts; finally he meets Lorca, also incarcerated and also before his execution, both already at the doorstep of immortality, Cristobal G. Montilla, El vuelo imposible del poeta buzo y la aviadora, [in:] El Mundo 30.05.14, available here A M√°laga school has been named after him. San Rafael, monument to those who died for freedom and democracy Hinojosa's memory remains politically charged.Hinojosa's life and death are related not only to political discussions about himself, but also to debates on political implications of surrealism in general, as ‚Äûwider concerns of the surrealist revolt opens up further issues related to the political orientation of Surrealism and of the path that Surrealism followed (for a while) with the communist party‚Äù, Rattray 2004, p. 47 Some tackle the Hinojosa-Lorca parallelismboth were almost peers, both were Andalusians, both formed the M√°laga group of young writers, both in the early 1920s studied in Madrid, both joined the artistic avant-garde circle there, both were poets, both were scandalizers, both were surrealists, both demonstrated similar type of fragile sensitivity, both were considered members of Generaci√≥n del 27, both were killed in August 1936 in close Andalusian locations declaring upfront that both were victims of \\"irrational hatred\\" produced by an \\"absurd war\\",Neira 1983, p. 29 yet among countless books discussing the civil war terror, almost all mention Lorca and almost none mention Hinojosa.this is the case e.g. of a vastly popular and massively quoted study of Paul Preston, dedicated entirely to terror of the civil war; neither its English nor Spanish version mention Hinojosa while Lorca is discussed at length, Paul Preston, The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, London 2012, and Paul Preston, El holocausto espa√±ol: Odio y exterminio en la Guerra Civil y despu√©s, Madrid 2011, . Also works which discuss the longtime impact of civil war terror (with focus on historiography and culture) rather than the terror itself follow suit, see e.g. Peter Anderson, Miguel √Ångel del Arco Blanco (eds.), Mass Killings and Violence in Spain, 1936‚Äì1952: Grappling with the Past, London 2015, . Exceptions are works focused on M√°laga, see e.g. Francisco Chica (ed.), Arcadia en llamas: Rep√∫blica y Guerra civil en M√°laga 1931‚Äì1937, M√°laga 2015, , p. 312. Some works dedicated to writers killed by the Republicans among tens of names do not list Hinojosa, see e.g. here Both right-wing and left-wing groups started to claim his legacy. Some Traditionalist sites honor him as \\"their man\\".see e.g. El Matiner Carl√≠ service, available here, Santo Reino Tradicionalista service, available here, Carlismo Andaluz service, available here Certain progressivist authors present him as a martyr who dedicated his life to fighting imperialism, nationalism and the church;in one work Hinojosa is presented as \\"opposed to any ruling that imposes restrictions from above, like imperialism, or that restraints human desire, like the church, or that curtails the expansion of ideas, like nationalism, the poet offers the knowledge he achieves in his creative journey in the image of those open, wounded bodies palpitating and sharing with the outside world their vulnerable but vibrant humanity. It is uncanny that such an offering would become a reality when Hinojosa was killed in 1936\\", Candelas Gala, Creative cognition and the cultural panorama of twentieth-century Spain, New York 2014, , see especially the chapter Creative Convulsion: Jos√© Mar√≠a Hinojosa and La Flor de Californ√≠a others imply his homosexuality.Hinojosa‚Äôs poem is included in the anthology of Fredo Arias de la Canal, Primera Antolog√≠a de la Poes√≠a Homosexual, Mexico 1997, p. 27. No scholar notes homosexual preferences of Hinojosa, moreover, some note that he felt uncomfortable in company of homosexual companions in Paris or Madrid The M√°laga San Rafael cemetery, where Hinojosa was executed, was doted in 2014 with a monument-mausoleum to honor \\"those who gave their life in defense of freedom and democracy and whose remains rest here or in other sites\\".Inaugurado el Pante√≥n de la Memoria Hist√≥rica de M√°laga, [in:] La Opinion de Malaga 11.01.14, available here.

He was born in Limoux (Aude, France) on March 4, 1833, in the house of his maternal grandfather, Louis Joly. His father, Jean Fran√ßois Fourni√©, who was a doctor of medicine, served at the time as an Inspector of the mineral waters of Alet-les-Bains. His mother, Marie C√©lestine Joly, was from a rich and notable family.  Biography  Starting at 14 years old, Edouard was studying medicine under close supervision of his father. At the age of 20, on January 23, 1853, young Edouard joined the Imperial Navy as an auxiliary surgeon (surgeon helper). First he was appointed to the Marengo, but then, in 1854, he was sent to the Crimea. His responsibility was to perform medical care on French soldiers and sailors suffering from cholera. In the process of this care, he himself was severely affected by this terrible disease, and had almost died. At the time of the siege of Sebastopol he served as a major surgeon on a big French flagship Le Caton. Then, in 1855, he was assigned to the hospital Therapia in Constantinople, with the responsibility to perform medical care on typhus patients. Again, he got severely infected and again had almost died. After that, he was repatriated to the France and retired from the army. He then completed his medical studies at the University of Montpellier, and on March 4, 1857, being exactly 24 years of age, had successfully finished his doctoral thesis, named (Typhus observed at the maritime hospital at Therapia).  Scientific contributions  The articles and books Edouard Fournie had produced during his long scientific career were touching exceptionally wide areas of medical knowledge. Among his major papers are those concerned with the anatomy and physiology of human and mammalian central nervous system, localizations of different functions in the brain, several aspects of medical philosophy and ethics, human psychology et cetera. His pioneering works on the physiology of human voice and speech started to resonate in international scientific and medical spheres only after his death. In 1873, Edouard Fournie tried to experiment to gain better understanding of the role of the thalamus in the brain. Having that idea in mind, he injected zinc chloride into the thalami of cats. Soon after that, he could observe in those cats severely diminished tactile, heat and pain sensitivity on the side, contralateral to the side of injection. Fournie's observations greatly helped to establish the role of thalamus as a major sensory relay station on the way to cortex.

It is most common for this to occur if the batsman is injured or unwell, in which case they have the option to resume their innings later. This is covered by Law 25 of the Laws of Cricket. Law 25 distinguishes between two types of retirement. If the batsman is ill or injured they are considered \\"retired - not out\\" and may be able to return to batting if they recover by the end of the innings. A batsman can also elect be \\"retired out\\" but in this case they may not return to the innings unless the opposing captain consents to this. These types of retirement are considered differently in Cricket statistics. Retired - not out If a batsman is injured or falls ill (or has some other unavoidable reason for leaving the field) while batting, he may retire and resume his innings at the dismissal or retirement of another batsman. If he cannot return by the end of the innings, the batting side must close its innings after all other batsmen are dismissed (excluding the not-out batsman). This can occur if the batsman requires medical attention away from the ground. It is therefore possible for the side batting last in a match to lose despite only losing nine (or potentially fewer) wickets. If the batsman is unable to resume their innings they are recorded as \\"Retired - not out\\". The term \\"retired - hurt\\" has been used but is not in accordance with the Laws of Cricket (particularly Law 25). Retired out In cricket, a batsman retires out if he retires without the umpire's permission and does not have the permission of the opposing captain to resume his innings. If such a return does not occur, the batman is marked as \\"retired out\\" and this is considered a dismissal for the purposes of calculating a batting average. As of 2019, only two batsmen have retired out in a Test match, and both instances occurred in the same innings: Sri Lankan batsmen Marvan Atapattu and Mahela Jayawardene.Cricinfo scorecard 2nd Test Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh at Colombo 6‚Äì10 September 2001 An exception to this rule was made for Gordon Greenidge who retired from the fifth Test of the 1982‚Äì83 India‚ÄìWest Indies series to visit his dying daughter.

He was the Roman Catholic Bishop of Rockhampton from 26 January 1913 until his death on 7 April 1931.  Early life  Joseph Shiel was born on 17 February 1873 at Swainstown, Killmessan, County Meath, Ireland, the son of Richard Shiel and his wife Ann (n√©e Smyth). He was educated at the local National School.  Religious life  Shiel found his vocation for religious life at a young age and entered the seminary of his diocese, St. Finian's College, at Navan. Following his success in a competitive examination, he entered the Maynooth College in September 1892. Shiel was ordained as a priest on 19 June 1898 by the Archbishop of Dublin. At the time of his ordination, Thomas Carr, Archbishop of Melbourne was visiting Ireland and was seeking priests to come to Australia. Shiel expressed a desire to go to Australia and the Bishop of Meath consented to a five year term. Shiel arrived in Melbourne on 11 October 1898. Initially he worked at St Patricks in Melbourne. In January 1899 he was appointed assistant to the Venerable Archdeacon Slattery at St Mary's in Geelong. In March 1901 he was transferred as assistant at St Mary's in Collingwood. In March 1903 he was transferred to St Peter's and St Paul's in South Melbourne. When his five year term had expired, Shiel wished to remain in Australia. Joseph Higgins, the Bishop of Rockhampton, was visiting Ireland in 1903 and, being a native of Meath, Higgins visited that diocese where he asked the Bishop of Meath to consent to Shiel remaining in Australia because of the great need for priests in Australia. The Bishop of Meath agreed for Shiel to remain, suggesting that he might assist Higgins in Rockhampton. Higgins returned to Australia and invited Shiel to join him in Rockhampton. Archbishop Carr of Melbourne agreed to the arrangement and Shiel became the administrator at Mount Morgan, west of Rockhampton. In February 1905 Shiel was appointed administrator of Rockhampton. In December 1905 Higgins was appointed Bishop of Ballarat and James Duhig was installed as the new Bishop of Rockhampton with Shiel acting as master of ceremonies. Higgins requested for Shiel to join him in Ballarat and Shiel arrived in Ballarat in March 1906 whereupon he was assigned to Hamilton in Western Victoria. In 1908 Shiel was appointed administrator of St Patrick's Cathedral in Ballarat. In April 1912, Shiel left Australia for a year's holiday. He travelled to Japan and China, where he visited his sister who was a member of a religious order in China. He then travelled to Ireland to visit his mother. Shortly after arriving in Ireland, he contracted a life-threatening case of typhoid fever. While convalescing from that illness, in October 1912 he was advised that he was to become the Bishop of Rockhampton, as James Duhig was being transferred to be the Titular Archbishop of Amica and Coadjutor to the Archbishop of Brisbane, Robert Dunne. On 26 January 1913, Shiel was consecrated as Bishop of Rockhampton at Maynooth College by Archbishop Daniel Mannix, the ceremony having been delayed due to Shiel's illness. On Sunday 11 May 1913, Shiel was enthroned at St Joseph's Cathedral in Rockhampton by James Duhig.  Later life  Shield died on 7 April 1931 aged 58 years at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital at Rockhampton, Queensland following a long illness. His funeral was held in St Joseph's Cathedral on 9 April 1931 after which he was buried in the Rockhampton Cemetery. In addition to the large local congregation, the funeral was attended by Archbishop James Duhig, Bishop of Cooktown John Heavey, and many other Catholic priests. The funeral cortege from the cathedral to the cemetery was so long that the first had arrived at the cemetery before the last had left the cathedral.

Oxygen firebreaks are fitted into the oxygen delivery tubing close to the patient, typically around the patient's sternum where the two nasal cannula tubes join and connect to the delivery tubing.  Home oxygen fires  thumb Oxygen is not flammable, but when it is present in increased concentrations it will enable fires to start much more easily. Once a fire has started, if supplemental oxygen is present it will burn more fiercely, based on the principle of the fire triangle. Materials that do not burn in ambient air may burn when there is a greater concentration of oxygen present than there is in air. Most home oxygen fires are caused by patients smoking whilst using medical oxygen. Despite the inherent dangers, researchers estimate that between 10 and 50 per cent of home oxygen patients continue to smoke. Other sources of naked flames, such as gas flames and birthday candles, can also pose a risk. Once a fire has started in the patient's nasal cannula it will track back towards the oxygen source and if not stopped may lead to a ‚Äòwhole house‚Äô fire. Whole house fires are directly correlated with single or even multiple deaths. According to the US National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), 25% of oxygen fires get beyond the immediate surrounding area to become ‚Äòwhole house‚Äô fires. While an oxygen firebreak / thermal fuse cannot stop the initial ignition, it can limit the potential for whole house fires, more serious injury and death. Firebreaks / thermal fuses can also buy more time for a patient and other individuals in the building to escape, and limit the material cost of fire damage.  Oxygen fire statistics  A study, The prevalence and impact of home oxygen fires in the USA, published in September 2019, analysed media reports of home oxygen fire incidents between December 2017 and August 2019. The report found 311 incidents, resulting in 164 deaths, equivalent to one patient death every four days. It also found that a third of reported incidents referenced exploding cylinders, posing a significant risk to third parties, including emergency services. The estimates that there are between 100 and 150 deaths every year from home oxygen fires in the US, describing it as a ‚Äòmaterial health issue‚Äô. In 2008 the NFPA published a report suggesting that there are 46 deaths each year in the US from 182 fires. The report also stated that US hospital emergency rooms deal with an average 1,190 cases of burns each year as a result of home oxygen fires. However, the NFPA describes these statistics as \\"likely underestimates\\". Further analysis by Marty Ahrens on behalf of the NFPA in 2017 recorded a likely average annual death rate for home fires involving oxygen administration equipment of 70 people (or 3% or all home fire deaths), based upon figures between 2011 and 2015. The report also suggested that these fires or burns are becoming more common. In 2019 the NFPA also reported that \\"medicinal oxygen was involved in 13% of the home smoking material fire deaths\\". The United States Fire Administration (USFA) said in a 2015 report that \\"While no one factor is solely responsible for the increased fire risk to older adults receiving home health care, smoking in the presence of oxygen is recognized as one important problem.\\" A study of home oxygen therapy patients in the Veterans Health Administration between 2009 and 2015 examined 123 cases of reported adverse events related to flash burns. It found that 100 cases (81%) resulted in injury, and 23 (19%) resulted in death. Although 89% of veterans claimed to have quit smoking, 92% of burns occurred as a result of smoking. Not all European countries monitor data on the number of fires that occur as a result of home oxygen. Despite a European Union Medical Device Directive requiring incidents to be reported to national vigilance authorities, there is often inadequate coordination to publish the information centrally. According to the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices ( Bundesinstitut fur Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, BfArM) it is likely that such incidents are grossly under-reported. In England and Wales, central reporting of adverse incidents is a requirement of the NHS Service Specification for Home Oxygen. After firebreaks became mandatory in 2006, the average number of deaths by fire was 0.36 per thousand patients per year. In the US, where firebreaks were not required, almost twice as many patients (0.62 patients per thousand) died. A Freedom of Information request in 2018 revealed that only fatality relating to home oxygen fires was recorded in the five-year period between 2013 and 2017.  Firebreak effectiveness  In 2018, a freedom of information request to all clinical commissioning groups in England (where firebreaks are mandatory) revealed that during the five years between 2013 and 2017 inclusive, 63 serious incidents involving oxygen fires were recorded and just one fatality. 73% of CCGs, representing 71% of patients in England, responded to the request. When the results are extrapolated to cover the whole patient population of 81,000, the figures are 89 incidents and 1.4 deaths. The fatality rate is significantly lower than any other previous study in the UK or internationally, and significantly lower than rates in the US or Japan where, compared with the equivalent patient population, they were 27 and 14 respectively. The white paper report suggests that the mandatory introduction of firebreaks, in conjunction with a \\"multidisciplinary approach to patient education\\", as well as risk assessments, is responsible for the low level of fatalities.http://www.firebreaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/BPR- WhitePaper2018.pdf  Home oxygen fire incidents  Some of the incidents involving deaths and injuries to patients, their relatives, fellow residents, as well as firefighters include: Richmond, Indiana, US. November 19, 2018 :Two people were killed and six injured in an apartment complex fire, 48 year old Andrew Thornburg and 56 year old Richard Wilkinson.

February, 2012 :A jury awarded $2.5 million in damages against Apria Healthcare after the death of 72-year-old Jimmy Kelley from Knox County. The award was reduced to $1.275 million after the jury found Kelley to be partly responsible. Mr Kelley, a smoker, also used a space heater in a camper van where oxygen cylinders were stored.  Regulation   United States  Before placing a new concentrator on the market, all oxygen concentrator manufacturers need to make a 510(k) premarket submission to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If the manufacturer chose to apply ISO 80601-2-69:2014 to demonstrate the safety of the new device, the fire safety elements of the standard, including ‚Äòa means to extinguish a tubing fire and isolate the oxygen flow‚Äô are a requirement. Approval to market the product would then be based upon compliance to the standard. In March, 2018, the US Veterans Health Administration issued a Patient Safety Alert mandating the use of thermal fuses in all its patients' home oxygen installations, unless there is a clinical reason for not doing so. The Patient Safety Alert applies to all patients, not just those deemed to be at 'high risk'. It requires two thermal fuses to be fitted per patient installation, and any unidirectional thermal fuses must be replaced with bidirectional versions at the next scheduled visit (unless the unidirectional thermal fuse is designed so it cannot be fitted in the wrong direction). In January 2020, in coordination with Fire Departments around the state and other agencies, the Wyoming State Fire Marshals Office launched the statewide community risk 307 CRR initiative. This aims to ‚Äúto reach users of home medical oxygen, place safety devices on their units, and provide a home-risk checkup for the residents when possible‚Äù. The initiative follows Wyoming fire data which revealed that more than fifty percent of the deaths in residential structure fires throughout the state have been in homes with medical oxygen. The goal of the initiative is to reduce fire deaths and injuries by 2024 by installing inline oxygen firebreaks in 100% of home using medical oxygen across the State.  Europe  In the European Union the fitting of firebreaks is a legal requirement for all home oxygen installations. All economic operators in the EU, including home oxygen service providers, must comply with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) or the Medical Device Regulation (2017/745). The instructions for use for an oxygen concentrator placed on the EU single market must include an instruction to the effect that a firebreak shall be fitted close to the patient to stop the flow of oxygen in the event of a fire. By including this statement the oxygen concentrator manufacturer is complying with the harmonised EN ISO type standard for oxygen concentrators EN ISO 8359:2009+A1:2012, which provides the manufacturer with an immediate presumption of conformity to the Essential Requirements of the Medical Devices Directive and allows them to properly apply the CE mark. Since January 2015 all instructions for use provided with oxygen concentrators placed on the European market will include this statement. The applied CE mark is reliant on the home oxygen service provider following this instruction and fitting a firebreak. If the firebreak is not fitted, then the Essential Requirements for performance and safety are not met and the CE mark is no longer valid. It also means that the home oxygen service provider's status, within the framework under which the single market for medical devices operates, changes from ‚Äòdistributor‚Äô to ‚Äòmanufacturer‚Äô. This has significant regulatory implications. The EU Medical Devices Directive also requires that economic operators adopt solutions that ‚Äòreduce risk as far as possible‚Äô in line with the ‚Äòstate of the art‚Äô. The fitting of firebreaks is therefore a requirement irrespective of the oxygen source, including oxygen concentrators, liquid oxygen dewars or gas cylinders.  United Kingdom  An additional legal requirement applies in the UK, where the fitting of firebreaks has been mandatory under the service specification of the home oxygen service since 2006.  Germany  In 2011, the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices recommended ‚Äòcorrective actions to prevent fires in oxygen concentrators‚Äô. It issued a notice stating that from July 1, 2012 all devices should be equipped with installations for stopping encroachment of the fire into the device, and interruption of the delivery of oxygen in the accessory as close to the patient as possible, in case of ignition. Manufacturers were also required to offer retrospective refitting for devices placed on the market before July 1, 2012.assessment notice (Case no. 2676/10)  World Health Organization guidance  The World Health Organization recommends ‚Äòfirebreak connectors to stop the oxygen flow in the event of fire‚Äô in all oxygen concentrators.  Oxygen firebreak standards  Three main standards cover the use of oxygen firebreaks / thermal fuses: * ISO 8359:1996/Amd.1:2012: Oxygen concentrators for medical use. Safety requirements The safety requirements for oxygen concentrators are governed by the amended standard ISO 8359:1996+A1:2012. The US FDA recognized the standard from January 2014. In January 2015, it was superseded by ISO 80601-2-69:2014. Health Canada, which is responsible for national public health, still recognizes the standard. * EN ISO 8359:2009+A1:2012: Oxygen concentrators for medical use. Safety requirements All of the 28 CEN (European Committee for Standardization) national standardization bodies (NSBs) have published EN ISO 8359:2009+A1:2012 as national standards. In Europe EN ISO 8359:2009+A1:2012 has harmonized standard status, which triggers ‚Äòpresumption of conformity‚Äô. * ISO 80601-2-69:2014: Medical electrical equipment ‚Äì Part 2-69: Particular requirements for basic safety and essential performance of oxygen concentrator equipment Included in ISO 80601-2-69:2014 are specific requirements that serve to mitigate the risk of fire related to oxygen therapy. The requirements state that the following should be provided: # A means to extinguish a tubing fire and isolate the oxygen flow in the accessories (nasal cannula and tubing or mask and tubing). The standard states that this should be fitted close to the patient. # A means to prevent the fire spreading into the oxygen concentrator outlet. The standard states that the means can also stop the flow of oxygen although it is not required to do so. It also specifies that if a bubble humidifier is fitted to the concentrator, that the means must also protect the bubble humidifier.

History Its predecessor was the Group of Forces on the Kursk direction, formed on 18 November 1918, under leadership of I.S. Kozhevnikov from troops arriving from the frontlines of the First World War. After its assignment to the Southern Front in December 1918, where it participated in January 1919 in the successful Voronezh‚ÄìPovorino Operation, it was renamed as the Donetsk Group of Forces in February 1919, and in March reformed as the 13th Army. In Spring 1919, it suffered serious losses in the Battle of the Donbass. In August and September 1919, together with the 8th Army, it became part of the Selivachyov Group, named after its commander Vladimir Selivachyov. On 10 January 1920 the Southern Front was renamed as the Southwestern of which the 13th Army remained a part. In September 1920 it was assigned to the second creation of the Southern Front, at that time fighting against Wrangel. During the Civil War the Army's force structure was highly dynamic with most subunits operating as part of operational groups. These included Special (reserve) Group (two regiments and a battery), Left Group (two divisions, cavalry and infantry brigades), Shock Group (Latvian division, Cossack cavalry brigade and separate brigade), and Perekopskaya Group (Latvian and 3rd divisions, 8th cavalry division, Nesterov group, and later 52nd division and 85th brigade of the 29th division). This last group fought on the approaches to Crimea, and experienced many changes, at one time including a group of armoured trains and the 1st Cavalry corps, but was eventually split between the Ekaterinoslav direction group of forces and the 6th Army. The rest of the 13th fought towards the southern coast of the Black sea between Perekop and north-east of Odessa. In October 1920 the army lost many of its units to the 2nd Cavalry Army. This first 13th Army participated in operations spanning an area from the southern Kursk gubernia to then Crimea.

One of the largest rivers in the province, it is primarily utilized by locals as a source of irrigation with little use as a waterway. History Around the 1750s, the Dutch VOC competed with the British Empire and the more local Palembangese for influence in Lampung, particularly in the pepper trade. Initially they were seen as less desirable to the locals of Tulang Bawang due to their tendency to avoid local conflicts. In 1751 a Dutch post was assaulted and captured by a local prince. It was not until themid-1800s when the Dutch East Indies managed to subjugate the locals and established formal administration over the banks. At the turn of the twentieth century, the banks of Tulang Bawang and its tributaries were settled by about 30,000 people, in comparison to the relatively unpopulated regions further away from the rivers.

She was born and raised in Taastrup, a suburb west of Copenhagen, Denmark. Her first books were the series Baade-Og, her latest books are The Nordic Secret (2017), Metamodernity (2019) and Bildung (2020). In 2018, Andersen co-founded the Copenhagen based think-tank Nordic Bildung and the folk-Bildung association Fremvirke. In 2019, she was the main initiator of European Bildung Day and in 2020 the co-founder of the European Bildung Network. Since January 2019, Andersen is a member of the Club of Rome.  Biography  From age 16, Andersen produced radio programs and wrote scripts for radio- and television satire. After studying business economy for three years, Andersen worked as a temp teacher and a temp secretary for two years before she studied theology for four years with the specific goal become a pastor in the Danish Evangelical Lutheran church. During her years of theology studies, she wrote entertainment for Danish television, in 1993, she had a religious crisis and quit her studies when she decided to convert to Judaism Andersen's debut as an author was in 2005 when she published the first book in the five volumes, 2,300 pages book series Baade-Og (Both-And, 2005‚Äì2009). She has since written several books, among them Democracy Handbook, which is also a website www.democracy-handbook.org. The Nordic Secret ‚Äì A European story of beauty and freedom, she wrote together with Tomas Bj√∂rkman. Her latest book is Metamodernity: Meaning and Hope in a Complex World. As an indie publisher in Denmark, Andersen's Det Andersenske Forlag (Andersenske publishing) has focused on popularizing philosophy and topics essential to democracy. In 2011, Andersen was appointed as a member of the Danish government's short-lived V√¶rdikommissionen (Values Commission).  Baade-Og  The book series Baade-Og (Both-And), consists of five books with the subtitles Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. They are written as a dialogue between the retired television producer Cornelius Magnussen, who is highly erudite and currently admitted to the psychiatric ward, and a lifestyle journalist, Tenna E. Rasmussen, who interviews him for five days. Over the course of the five days, they cover big history and a number of scientific theories explaining how nature and culture evolve: scale- free networks, thermodynamics, chaos theory, complexity theory, the concepts of memes and meme-plexes, and evolution itself plus a host of other sciences in order to explore how culture and civilization evolve. It is all connected in what Andersen calls Global Existentialism: what kind of species do we want to be? The scientific theories are thus linked together and put in new contexts, e.g. Darwin's evolutionary theory being compared to Kierkegaard's teachings about the three stages in life. In the Wednesday-part, the protagonist Magnussen formulates a declaration of \\"global existentialism\\" which departs from the old perception of the world characterized by the linear, absolute and inflexible. Instead, the proposed new world view takes into account relativity, complementarity and quantum theory, posing that everything is unpredictable, complex and cannot be described in absolute terms. Here the concept of \\"Homo Liquens\\" (the liquid human being) is introduced, as opposed to being \\"one or the other\\", which refers to Kierkegaard's Either-Or. Global Existentialism must also be political since human beings have a universal civil obligation., anmeldelse, Politiken, 17. december 2006 In order to preserve the rule of law, humanity, democracy and pluralism, approaches that embrace \\"both and\\" are needed for global and complex solutions. Andersen's later books in Danish, such as (Globally Shifting Up) from 2014, also approach the complexity of the future and how we can prepare for it.  The Nordic Secret  The Nordic Secret ‚Äì A European Story of Beauty and Freedom. A book by Lene Rachel Andersen, written together with Tomas Bj√∂rkman and published November 2017. The Nordic countries are repeatedly in the top-ten of happiest countries, best for business etc. Andersen and Bj√∂rkman explore why and trace the success of the Nordics back to the invention of the folk high schools that were invented in Denmark in 1844. The schools did not become an immediate success, but after the Danish military defeat to Bismarck‚Äôs Prussia in 1864, a movement started in Denmark creating folk high schools. The 1860s was also when the concept of the folk high schools was copied in Norway and Sweden, later folk high schools were started in Finland as well. Through the folk high schools, the Nordic countries have created a culture of civic responsibility, cultural self-awareness, and high expectations of individual moral and emotional development.  Metamodernity  In 2019, Andersen wrote Metamodernity: Meaning and Hope in a Complex World. Contrary to most versions of metamodernism, which generally integrate only modernity and postmodernism, in Metamodernity Andersen explores the possible integration of indigenous, premodern, modern, and postmodern cultural code into one future cultural code that can serve as a model for meaning-making in the 21st century. The advantage of integrating all four cultural codes into metamodernity rather than just two cultural codes into metamodernism, is the much deeper potential for meaning-making that this offers. Metamodernity thus provides us with a framework for understanding ourselves and our societies in a complex way that matches the complexity of the globalized world in which we already live. By integrating both indigenous, premodern, modern, and postmodern cultural elements, metamodernity provides social norms and a moral fabric for intimacy, spirituality, religion, science, and self-exploration, all at the same time. It is a way of strengthening local, national, continental, and global cultural heritage among all and it thus has the potential to protect cultures as the economy as well as the internet and exponential technologies are disrupting our current modes of societal organization and governance. Metamodernity, according to Andersen, will thus allow us to be meaning making at a deeper emotional level and a higher intellectual level compared to today; it will allow us more complex understanding, which may match the complexity of the problems we need to solve.  Bildung  Andersen‚Äôs latest book is Bildung: Keep Growing (2020). The first half of this 171-page book is a condensed version of The Nordic Secret (512 pages), the second half offers both a theoretical exploration of why and how folk-bildung affected Scandinavian youth and society as of the 1860s, and a new and more concise vocabulary for dealing with bildung in the 21st century. Among the models used as analytical tools in the second half of the book are the cultural codes explored in Metamodernity, Circles of Belonging and The Bildung Rose. The Circles of Belonging model explores 10 circles or spheres of consciousness, belonging, identity, solidarity, conscience, and sense of responsibility. The ten Circles are: 1: Self, 2: Family One (where we grow up), 3: Peer groups, 4: Family Two (the family we establish ourselves), 5: Local communities, 6: Nation and/or religion, 7: Culture Zone, 8: Humanity today, 9: All life on the planet now, and 10: Life as such, now and in the future. Circles 2-5 are real communities, whereas Circles 6-10 are what Benedict Anderson referred to as imagined communities.  The Bildung Rose  The Bildung Rose explores how societies evolve, grow and become more complex across seven domains: 1) production; 2) technology; 3) knowledge/science; 4) ethics; 5) narrative; 6) aesthetics, and 7) power. Since we need to understand our society in order to thrive, the model thus connects our inner worlds to society. Understanding the relationship between self and society is increasingly crucial as societies become more complex.

Ovenden Moor is located north of Halifax and west of Bradford in West Yorkshire. The site was opened in 1993 with 23 turbines, but these were later removed in favour of larger turbines but with 14 fewer towers. This updated the output of the site from 9.2 MWh to 22.5 MWh with an expected generation lifetime of 25 years. As the turbines can be seen from some distance and the fact that they overlook the Bront√´ Country to the north, they have the subject of continued criticism and objections. Geology This moorland area of the South Pennines is mostly overlaid with peat and underlaid with sandstone that is 310 million years old. The area in and around Ovenden Moor was quarried for the Rough Rock Flagstone that was used for buildings in the Halifax area. There are also bands of mudstone and coal, with coal being worked historically in the area (east of Ovenden Moor) even though the seams were very narrow by commercial colliery standards. History The site was first proposed as a wind farm in the early 1990s and development took place soon after government approval was granted in 1992. At a cost of ¬£10.6 million, 23 turbines were erected at above sea level in a staggered V-shape to take advantage of the prevailing south-westerly wind. The site first started generating power in June 1993. The first generation wind turbines were designed and built by Vestas with a height of and would each generate 400 kWh with the whole site generating 9.2 MWh in total. The turbines on the site would start generating power at and would reach their optimum power generation at . The power output from the site was fed via a sub-surface 11 kilovolt cable eastwards into the National Grid near to the village of Denholme. The first generation site provided enough power for 5,600 homes and stopped over of carbon dioxide and over of sulphur dioxide being released into the atmosphere. The development of the wind farm included many groundworks to locate the foundations in the peat that overlies the bedrock.The peat overlies a bedrock of coal measures and millstone grit. During the building phase, a crack in the bedrock, as a result of the earthworks, diverted a watercourse and the cabling works caused the peat to dry out. This has been cited by opponents of wind farm schemes across the United Kingdom when challenging the application process at the approvals stage. Access from the local roads onto the moorland was developed using a special floating road of interwoven plastic grids. This was one of the first uses of this style of access to prevent degradation of the peat underlying the track of the road. The wind farm was temporarily switched off in late April and early May 2010 due to an extensive moor fire that had to be tackled by the West Yorkshire Fire Service. Funding for the wind farm was supplied partly from the European Commission's Thermie Programme which was designed to help start renewable energy projects. The Commission funded ‚Ç¨2 million of the final ‚Ç¨9.1 million towards the project. The builders of the wind farm were also required to report back to the EU to outlay the inherent planning, cost, infrastructure and operating problems of a windfarm on high moorland. Ovenden Moor Wind Farm. These are some of the original 23 turbines. The old turbines and towers were decommissioned by March 2015 and were replaced in 2016 by a ¬£12 million scheme of tall newer generation units which are capable of generating 2.5 MWh each. The total power output of the new wind farm is 22.5 MWh which meant that only four turbines need to be erected to supplant the power of the turbines they were replacing. Spanish company Gamesa had won the contract and supplied nine of its G80 (2MW) turbines. Planning was initially submitted for ten turbines in 2008, but was reformed and re-submitted in 2012 with one less turbine, downrating the power output from 25 MW to 22.5 MW. The site is estimated to be generating electricity 95% of the time and is believed to be able to generate 49 GWh per year (enough to supply over 11,000 homes) and would save over of carbon dioxide being released into the environment over a year. Ovenden Moor Repower started generating in early 2017, despite weather related delays in the construction of the site and is expected to be generating electricity for 25 years. The older turbines suffered from a lower generation outputs due to wind strength, whereas the newer turbines have a higher rated resistance to damage from strong winds. The older turbines would automatically shut off when the wind was blowing above , although this was not enough to prevent damage as on at least one occasion, the sails of some of the turbines were ripped off in strong winds. The newer turbines have been designed to withstand windspeeds of up to , a far higher threshold than the previous ones. The generating company is Yorkshire Wind Power Limited who operate two other wind farms at Royd Moor near to Penistone in South Yorkshire and Out Newton near to Easington in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The first generation venture was a 50/50 joint enterprise between Yorkshire Water and Yorkshire Electricity. Yorkshire Water sold their stake in the business in May 2002 to Energy Powers Resources. Yorkshire Wind Power is now a joint 50/50 enterprise between E.ON Climate and Renewables and Energy Power Resources Ltd, although the land is still owned by Yorkshire Water. Operation of the wind farm is controlled remotely from E.ON's offices in Coventry in the West Midlands. The wind farm has been praised but has mostly been criticised by local people and also the local MP. Whilst campaigners against the wind farm recognise that the it produces Low-carbon energy,Wind turbines can be carbon neutral after six months, but this timeframe is often expanded due to the need to build roads across peat moorland which dries out the peat and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere it was noted that the wind farm had only been operating for 31% of the time in 2005 and only 25% of the time in 2009. The proximity to Haworth had raised objections by The Bronte Society and the local population that the turbines were despoiling the area and would have a negative effect on tourism to the region. This was highlighted by local people when the plans for the new height of the wind turbines was being unveiled, with comments stating that their visibility will be further than ever before and attracting the view that it will despoil a huge swathe of Yorkshire, (on a clear day, the turbines will be able to be seen from away). The location of the site is north of Halifax, west of Bradford, south of Haworth and the area it overlooks to the north is designated as Bront√´ Country. The site is closest to the village of Ogden and Ogden Reservoir ( to the south east), but the high ground it occupies is known as Ovenden Moor. The site straddles the watershed between the waters that feed Warley Reservoir to the west, the Worth Valley to the north, the Calder Valley to the south, and Airedale and the Upper Bradford district to the east.

The pottery fabric is tempered with enough quartz sand mixed in with the clay for it to be visible in the fabric of the pot. Sandy ware was commonly used in Southeast England and the East Midlands. Description The identifying feature of Sandy ware is the use of quartz sand as a temper. Sand helped bind the clay together in forming the object, and kept the finished object from cracking while being dried and subsequently fired. The amount of sand used and the size of the sand grains in making Sandy ware differed by region and time period in Britain. The pottery was typically handmade or thrown on a slow wheel and fired on a bonfire, until around the tenth century when potters began transitioning to using a fast wheel. History Sandy wares are commonly found in Great Britain from the sixth through the fourteenth centuries. Archaeological excavations during the last fifty years have uncovered important areas of pottery production and use, including Southeast England and the East Midlands. Southeast England =Kent= Medieval sandy ware sherds Archaeological excavations conducted at Lyminge, Kent from 2008 to 2010 uncovered over 6000 pottery sherds. Among the finds were sandy wares from the sixth to the tenth centuries, and the most important finds were from Canterbury. In Canterbury, mid to late Anglo Saxon pottery are predominantly Sandy wares and Shelly wares. The study revealed that the most common pottery type found in Kent during the early to mid Anglo- Saxon era was Sandy Ware, which included three different groups: fine sandy ware, sandy ware, and coarse sandy ware. Five Sandy Ware fabrics were identified during the study. Jars, cups and bowls were determined to be the predominant vessel types in the excavation at Lyminge. The majority of the pottery fragments uncovered had either no decoration or simple decoration, typically with incised lines. Shelly ware began to replace Sandy ware as the most commonly used pottery type in Kent during the 8th and 9th centuries. \\"Fine sandy ware\\" is defined as pottery with a hard and a slightly rough fabric, brownish-grey in colour with a sandy matrix. \\"Sandy ware\\" is divided into two different subtypes, referred to in the study as Fabric 75 and Fabric 76. Fabric 75 dates to the sixth to the seventh centuries. It has a hard fabric, with a rough, dimpled surface. Fabric colour is black or brownish-grey with a brown core. It has also has a fine, sandy matrix. Fabric 76 dates from the seventh to the eighth centuries. It is characterized as having a hard, course fabric. The colour is black and dark grey, and it has a sandy matrix. \\"Course Sandy ware\\" has two subtypes, fabric 78 and fabric 87. Fabric 78 has a soft, smooth fabric and is dark grey in colour. It has a sandy matrix with random sedimentary rock fragments. Fabric 87 has a hard, irregular fabric with an orange coloured outer surface and black core. It also has a sandy matrix and has thick-walls. =Essex= Essex Micaceous Sandy ware, also known as Early Medieval Essex Micaceous Sandy ware, is commonly found in South Cambridgeshire from the eleventh to the twelfth centuries. This type of sandy ware is characterized by the use micaceous clays, which resulted in brown and grey-brown fabrics. Like most early medieval pottery, Essex sandy ware was handmade and wheel thrown. The fabric is coarse and dimpled in texture and tempered with sand grains and mica. Pottery forms include jars, bowls, spouted bowls and curfew bells. =London= Early Medieval Sandy ware appears in London for the first time in the last quarter of the tenth century. Shelly ware was also commonly used at the time. The pottery fabric was tempered with a large number of quartz sand grains. The sandy ware vessels were all handmade at the time and have thinner walls and are more roughly made than Late Saxon Shelly ware. The pottery forms of Early Medieval Sandy Ware and Early Medieval Sand and Shell ware are similar. Two sandy ware forms that have been found from this time period in London are the cooking-pot and the shallow dish. East Midlands Lincoln sandy ware fragment Medieval Sandy Ware first appeared in the East Midlands during the middle of the 12th century and was commonly found in the area until the end of the fourteenth century. Of the many pottery sherds found during archeological excavations, there is very little evidence to determine pottery forms. Of the few sherds that could be identified, the forms were described as bowls, cooking pots, jars, and jugs. The pottery was possibly a mix of local and imported sandy ware types. There were two types of Early Medieval ware, an earlier type and a later type. The first group dates from the twelfth to the thirteenth century. The characteristics of the pottery are a fabric that is orange to light grey in colour, the light grey colour typically has an oxidized brown surface. The fabric was tempered with numerous quartz sand grains. Clubbed rims were characteristic of this pottery. The later Medieval Sandy ware type has a date range from the thirteenth to the fourteenth centuries. It is characterized by a pinkish-orange colour, sometimes with reduced, grey cores. The fabric is tempered with a large number of quartz sand particles and some iron oxide grains. A pale green glaze was seen on several of the pottery sherds.

Career Athenia (8668 tons) was built in 1903, for the Donaldson line Originally built for the Clyde-Canada service as 7,835 gross tons, length 478ft x beam 56ft, one funnel, four masts, twin screw, speed 14 knots, accommodation was for 12-1st class passengers. Launched on 20 October 1903 by her shipbuilder, Vickers. Sons & Maxim for Donaldson Bros, Glasgow. She embarked on her maiden voyage from Glasgow to Montreal on 21 May 1904. She soon proved to be too large for the service, and in 1905 she was fitted with additional passenger accommodation for 50-2nd and 450-3rd class passengers and her tonnage was increased to 8,668 grosse tonnes. Her first voyage as a passenger ship was 25 March 1905 when she embarked from Glasgow for St. John. N.B and she continued sailings to St. John and Quebec / Montreal. In 1913 she transferred to the Donaldson Line Ltd and in 1916 went to the Anchor-Donaldson Line. When Canadian troops embarked for Europe on 30 September 1914, a Burgess-Dunne seaplane was loaded aboard for England. On the trip the aircraft was heavily damaged. She was sunk 7 miles north off Inishtrahull, Ireland; with the loss of 15 lives and 440 horses. Sunk by SM U-53 on 16 August 1917. She was a defensively armed merchantman, she was torpedoed some 6 metres from her stern by SM U-53 while steaming at 20 knots, then abandoned and sunk. On her final voyage she was on passage from Montreal to Glasgow, and was in course of repatriating some members of the crew of HMHS Letitia (she had picked up at Halifax, Nova Scotia) when she was torpedoed; relatives were required to travel to Donegal to identify the bodies. Both the Letitia and the Athenia were ships of the Donaldson Line. Wreck Malin Head gives its name to the Malin sea area, where the wreck is a known diving site; lying at a depth of 55 metres. It had been depth-charged in World War II to prevent it becoming a hiding place for U-boats on the seabed. Consequently it is well opened up, so large parts of it can be examined. The line continued passenger service until 1966 and finally ceased operation in 1967 with the sale of its remaining cargo ships. Legacy The Donaldson line were to pay tribute to the ship by naming a second in 1922; however, after its sinking in 1939, the Line would never use the Athenia name again. The line discontinued its passenger service in 1966 and finally ceased cargo operations in 1967 when it sold its last remaining cargo ships.

Its full name is \\"Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the respect for private life and the protection of personal data in electronic communications and repealing Directive 2002/58/EC (Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications).\\" It would repeal the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002 (ePrivacy Directive) and would be lex specialis to the General Data Protection Regulation. It would particularise and complement the latter in respect of privacy-related topics. Key fields of the proposed regulation are the confidentiality of communications, privacy controls through electronic consent and Browsers, and cookies. The scope of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under discussion. According to some proposals, it would apply to any business that processes data in relation to any form of online communication service, uses online tracking technologies, or engages in electronic direct marketing. The proposed penalties for noncompliance would be up to ‚Ç¨20 million or, in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher. The ePrivacy Regulation originally was intended to come in effect on 25 May 2018, together with the GDPR, but has still not been adopted. Difference between Regulation and Directive The (new) ePrivacy Regulation will repeal the (current) ePrivacy Directive. Contrary to an EU Directive, an EU Regulation is a legal act of the European Union that becomes immediately effective as law in all member states simultaneously. The current ePrivacy Directive is a legal act of the European Union that requires member states to achieve a particular result without dictating the means of achieving that result. It has therefore been implemented into national laws and regulations. If the proposed ePrivacy Regulation became effective, these laws would be superseded and will (for reasons of clarity) likely be repealed. The ePrivacy Regulation would be self-executing and not require many implementing measures. Key points of Commission's proposal According to the EU Commission, the proposal includes the following key changes:: * New players: Privacy rules will also apply to new players providing electronic communications services such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype. That will ensure that the popular services guarantee the same level of confidentiality of communications as traditional telecoms operators. * Stronger rules: All people and businesses in the EU will enjoy the same level of protection of their electronic communications through this directly applicable regulation. Businesses will also benefit from one single set of rules across the EU. * Communications content and metadata: Privacy is guaranteed for communications like the time and the location of a call. Metadata have a high privacy component and must be anonymised or deleted if users did not give their consent unless the data is needed for billing. * New business opportunities: Once consent is given for communications data (content and/or metadata) to be processed, traditional telecoms operators will have more opportunities to provide additional services and to develop their businesses. For example, they could produce heat maps indicating the presence of individuals, which could help public authorities and transport companies when developing new infrastructure projects. * Simpler rules on cookies: The cookie provision, which has resulted in an overload of consent requests for internet users, will be streamlined. The new rule will be more user-friendly, as browser settings will provide for an easy way to accept or refuse tracking cookies and other identifiers. The proposal also clarifies that no consent is needed for non-privacy-intrusive cookies improving internet experience (like to remember shopping cart history) or cookies used by a website to count the number of visitors. * Protection against spam: The proposal bans unsolicited electronic communications by emails, SMS, and automated calling machines. Depending on national law, people will either be protected by default or be able to use a do-not-call list to avoid receiving marketing phone calls. Marketing callers will need to display their phone number or use a special pre-fix that indicates a marketing call. * More effective enforcement: The enforcement of the confidentiality rules in the regulation will be the responsibility of data protection authorities, already in charge of the rules under the General Data Protection Regulation.

Shelly ware includes Late Saxon Shelly ware, Early Medieval Shelly Ware, and Lincolnshire Shelly Wares. The pottery fabric is tempered with shell powder or reduced shell. Shelly ware was typically handmade until the tenth century, when potters transitioned to wheel-thrown pottery. Shelly wares were manufactured and distributed in the Upper Thames Valley, southeastern coastal areas of Britain and the East Midlands. History The Anglo-Saxon era consists of three different time periods: the early Anglo-Saxon era, which spans the mid-fifth to the beginning of the seventh century; the middle Anglo-Saxon era, which covers the seventh thru the ninth centuries; and the late Anglo-Saxon era, which includes the tenth and eleventh centuries. The Early Medieval period for pottery in Britain begins in 1066, from the Norman Conquest, and ends at the close of the 12th century. During the early and middle Anglo-Saxon era in southeast England, sandy wares, organic tempered ware, imported grey wares and a small number of Ipswich wares were commonly found. Shell-tempered ware, often referred to as \\"Shelly wares\\" first appeared in the area in the seventh century and continued to be used until the end of the ninth century. Late Saxon Shelly Ware was manufactured in the Upper Thames Valley and distributed over a widespread area, including London. Shell-tempered ware was used extensively in London from the late ninth century to the early eleventh century when it suddenly disappeared. In the last quarter of the tenth century, a small amount of Early Medieval Sandy ware was in common use, along with Late Saxon Shelly ware. Shelly ware evolved into the Early Medieval Shelly-Sandy ware of the eleventh century. In the East Midlands, Shelly wares were typically manufactured and distributed locally. Lincolnshire Shelly wares includes Lincolnshire Late Saxon Shelly ware and Lincolnshire Kiln type Shelly ware, which date from the late ninth to the late tenth centuries, and Early Lincoln shelly ware, which dates from the 10th to 11th centuries. Description Shelly wares refer to several types of shell tempered wares found during the Anglo-Saxon and early medieval era in Britain. The pottery can be divided into several groups characterized by region and time period. Shelly ware fabric is tempered with crushed marine shell or fossil shell, depending upon the location of the source of shell. Shelly ware was typically handmade and fired on a bonfire until the early tenth century. By the middle of the tenth century, wheel thrown production was replacing hand made pottery manufacturing in the east midlands, Upper Thames Valley, and southeastern england. An early Medieval pottery rim sherd from a Shelly ware jar Late Saxon Shelly ware is a pottery type in widespread use in London from the late ninth through the mid eleventh centuries. The fabric of Late Saxon Shelly ware contains numerous fragments of shell, which on microscopic examination, are seen to be encompassed in a chalky matrix. The pottery has a wide distribution area in the Upper Thames Valley. It is similar in fabric to Surrey whitewares. Jars and bowls are the primary forms. Early Medieval Shelly ware is similar in fabric to Late Saxon shelly ware, but the medieval ware contains shell inclusions that are generally bivalve and the fabric often contains small quantities of flint and quartz. Early Medieval shelly ware fabric is also similar to Surrey whitewares. Forms generally have thinner walls than earlier shelly ware. It was commonly used from the middle of the eleventh century to the middle of the twelfth century. Lincolnshire Late Saxon Shelly ware fabrics are generally hard with a fine texture. Fabric colours include brown, reddish- brown and dark grey. Lincolnshire Kiln-Type Shelly ware and Lincoln Early Shelly wares have a grey fabric colour with inclusions of a few shells and quartz sand filler.

Ever since, she has felt intensely for the world of fragrances, which for her echoed the world of music, and the piano pieces she had studied when she was a child. After a doctorate in history, she became a member of the commission responsible for cultural affairs at the fashion firms Chanel and Bourjois. She established and managed the departments there, acquiring her first basic knowledge of the raw materials for fragrance. After this experience, she decided, in 1997, to found her own firm, \\"Arty Fragrance\\", where she started working as a consultant for olfactory and cultural development. She moved on to work for prestigious names in the world of fragrance-making: among others, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Chanel, Christian Dior Perfume, L'Or√©al Paris, and also Guerlain. She continued her fundamental research work fragrance and wrote books about it: Jean-Louis Fargeon, perfumer of Marie-Antoinette (2005), L'Herbier de Marie-Antoinette (2012), Les Parfums, histoire, dictionnaire, anthologie (2011), Les 101 mots du parfums (2013)... Today a well-known expert on perfume, she has been acknowledged as such by famous, high-profile perfume companies. Since 1998, she has been teaching at the \\"School of Fragrances\\", in Versailles. She has put up several exhibitions, such as \\"Parfums de Promenade\\", in the \\"Galerie des Galeries\\" (Galeries Lafayette, 2001) and at \\"La Cour des Senteurs de Versailles\\" (2013). She has also animated workshops and conferences all around the world, particularly in Francophone countries. In 2011, she introduced the brand \\"Arty Fragrance by Elisabeth de Feydeau\\", where she created and commercialized a more confidential line of perfumes, all inspired by the luxury and sophistication of the French 17th and 18th centuries, such as they could be felt, more than anywhere else, at the Ch√¢teau de Versailles: she has often wandered around in the Park of Versailles, while doing research work for her books. In 2006, she was chosen by the rose-breeder Meilland to be godmother to the new rose called \\"Petit Trianon\\", along with another perfume- maker, Francis Kurkdjian, with whom she had just recreated the fragrance of French queen Marie-Antoinette: Le Sillage de la Reine. Since 2008, she has been holding a blog where she regularly publishes articles about perfumes, perfume-makers ‚Äì and, in a more general way, about the world of perfumes.

It is Disney India's first general entertainment channel and first channel to be broadcast in high-definition and broadcast in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The channel is primarily funded by subscriptions with secondary revenue from advertising and is targeted to the 14-‚Äì25 years age group while the other Disney networks broadcast in the area are aimed towards a 2-14 age group audience. It is being replaced by DisneyCchannel HD on 29 September as it will bring more TRP. It will have only original programming(like Cartoon Network HD+) with shows like GoodLluckCcharlie, Ducktales,BbigCcityGgreen,s etc, all of these shows will be in English only as it is a replacement. History In April 2016, Disney Channel India dropped live-action programming to focus more on local animation, as those shows drove better ratings. Disney Broadcasting India had made a license application for Disney International HD on 17 March 2017 with the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (MIB). MIB approved the license on September 1, 2017 to take over from Bindass Play with Bindass Play programming shifting over to Bindass. The channel was launched on 29 October 2017. 10 of the 30 available TV series were on the channel at launch. During the channel's first few weeks of broadcast, it didn't show any commercials. Programming Disney International HD shows an exclusive (as it has not been syndicated elsewhere) library of over 1500 or more episodes coming from 30 live action series. The channel also airs 100+ Disney movies selected for the targeted ages of 14 to 25 years old. Unlike other Disney networks, Disney International HD didn't initially feature any animated content. But since mid of 2019, it started airing some animated shows, which has been discontinued. Music video and sing-alongs from the library's series and movies used to be featured. In early 2020, animated shows were removed, because of Disney+ Hotstar, Disney Channel (Indian TV Channel) and Cartoon Network (that owns Pokemon). Live- action shows that had been temporarily taken off air have returned with newer seasons along with newer shows.

Built about 1781 and repeatedly enlarged and altered, it was the town's only surviving 18th-century mill building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and has subsequently been demolished. Description and history The Hitchcock-Schwarzmann Mill stood in a rural area of northern Burlington, at the northeast corner of Foote and Vineyard Roads. The mill was a rambling collection of attached wood-frame structures, its main building set over a branch of Burlington Brook, which provided the power used by the mill. The main block was a 2-1/2 story timber-framed building, with heavy pegged timbers and kingpost roof trusses. South of this was a shed-roof single-story element, and there were three smaller structures attached to the western end. To the south stands an 18th-century miller's house, a 1-1/2 story Cape style house with a five-bay facade and central chimney, and a similar house, also associated historically with the mill, stands a short way to the northeast. The mill building has been demolished, and only foundational remnants survive. The main mill building was built about 1781, apparently by Jared Tyler, and was initially used for the grinding of grain. In the early 19th century the miller was Joel Hitchcock, and the property was purchased in 1880 by George Schwarzmann. By then it had been expanded to include a sawmill. The Schwarzmann family operated the mill until 1972, also adding a cider mill and shingle mill to the operation. The mill complex was purchased in 1976 by the Burlington Historical Society, which had the intention of adapting it as a museum property. At that time, it housed much of its original equipment, although its original waterwheel had been replaced in the 19th century by a then-modern turbine.

Members of this echimyid subfamily all share an origin in the eastern part of Brazil, close to the Atlantic Forest.  Morpho-anatomy  The teeth of Euryzygomatomyines are characterized by several features: * elongate lower and upper incisor roots ; * five lophids on the lower deciduous premolars 4 ; * either four lophids in Trinomys, or three lophids in Clyomys and Euryzygomatomys, on the lower molars 1 ; * well-connected lophs on the cheek teeth ; * three molar roots anchoring the upper molars. Their zygomatic arch is reduced with a slightly concave dorsal margin, and the jugal bone is ventrally expanded with much reduced, scarcely salient inferior process.  Molecular signatures  At the protein level, one amino acid replacement from leucine to proline yields a shared derived character state that is diagnostic for defining the Euryzygomatomyinae: the amino-acid proline at position homologous to site 294 of the human GHR.Growth Hormone Receptor (GHR) protein: NCBI accession AAI36497.1  Phylogeny  Within Euryzygomatomyinae, Clyomys is the sister group to Euryzygomatomys. In turn, these two fossorial genera are the sister group to the terrestrial Trinomys. In the phylogeny of the family Echimyidae, Euryzygomatomyinae is the sister group to a large assemblage comprising Carterodon and the family Capromyidae.

The keeper of the prison was the Marshal of the Four Courts, a role filled after 1546 by the Constable of Dublin Castle.Gilbert 1854, p.43 Name Other debtor's prisons in Dublin which shared the name were the City Marshalsea, and the Marshalseas of Saint Sepulchre (abolished 1856) and of Thomas Court and Donore (abolished 1826). The original Marshalsea prison from which these were named was built in Southwark south of the City of London, for prisoners from the Marshalsea Court presided over by the Knight Marshal. Buildings In 1580 the Four Courts Marshalsea was built on Werburgh Street. By 1750 it was in Molesworth Court, which was abandoned in 1777 in disrepair.Gilbert 1854, p.61 The final building was in Marshalsea Lane (no longer extant) off Marshal Lane (now Robert Emmet Close), off Bridgefoot Street, off Thomas Street. It was described by Samuel Lewis as \\"a large building ... the prison has two court-yards, two chapels, several common halls and a ball-court.\\" Conditions John Dillon said in 1898: : I remember the Marshalsea Prison in Dublin, and in that gaol we had a nice suite of rooms, and we had balls there, and many a pleasant hour I have spent there, in the society of many of the most delightful men in Dublin, who were in the habit of spending some time at that resort. This was 25 years ago, and it was perfectly well recognised then that there was no kind of punishment in the debtors' gaol. They were held there until they made an arrangement with their creditors, but they had everything that their means would allow them to have in prison. Prisoners Originally the Four Courts Marshalsea was a remand prison for criminal trials in the Four Courts, and a debtor's prison for cases brought to the Court of King's Bench (one of the Four Courts) from all over Ireland. In 1842, the Four Courts Marshalsea received remaining prisoners from three closing prisons: * City Marshalsea, prisoners under warrant from the \\"Court of Conscience and Lord Mayor's Court\\". The Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 had abolished the power of arrest from the Court of Conscience and Lord Mayor's Court, so that no new prisoners were committed to the City Marshalsea. * Two prisons rendered obsolete by the Debtors (Ireland) Act 1840, which abolished arrest on mesne process in most civil actions: ** Newgate, prisoners from the city coroner's court; ** the Sheriff's Prison, prisoners from three of the Four Courts (King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer) and from the city recorder's court In 1856, the Four Courts Marhsalsea received remaining prisoners from the Marshalsea of the abolished Manor of St. Sepulchre. Closure The Four Courts Marshalsea was abolished by the Four Courts Marshalsea Discontinuance Act 1874, because of \\"the very small and diminishing number of persons in that prison, and to the very large prison staff in proportion to the number of prisoners\\". The Dublin Militia used it as a barracks in the later 19th century. It stood empty for some years before its demolition in 1975. Some of the stone went to repair the City wall at Cook Street.

Infectious coryza. In: Calnek B W, Barnes H J, Beard C W, McDougald L R, Saif Y M, editors. Diseases of poultry. 10th ed. Ames: Iowa State University Press; 1997. pp. 179‚Äì190Merck Veterinary Manual, 2016 The disease is found all over the world causing high economic losses. Economic loss is due to stumping off and reduction of egg production in case of laying chickens. The disease was discovered early 1930s by considering clinical signs. Signs and symptoms Clinical appearance of the disease includes depression, a serous nasal discharge, and sporadically minor facial inflammation in mild form of the disease. In severe form, there is severe inflammation of one or both infraorbital sinuses with edema of the surrounding tissue. The swelling can cause closure of one eye or both of them. Intermandibular space and wattles of corks do swell as a course of the disease. Cause The disease is caused by bacteria called Avibacterium paragallinarum, which is a gram-negative bacterium. The bacterium is microaerophilic rod-shaped and is nonmotile. Its growth requires presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. There are three serovars A, B and C of A. paragallinarum that relate by immunotype specificity. Transmission The reservoirs of the disease are carrier chickens which could be healthy but harboring the disease or chronically sick chickens. The disease affects all ages of chickens. The disease can persist in the flock for 2-3 weeks and signs of the disease are seen between 1‚Äì3 days post infection. Transmission of the disease is through direct interaction, airborne droplets and drinking contaminated water. Chicken having infection and those carriers contribute highly to the disease transmission. Diagnosis It is done through isolation of bacteria from chickens suspected to have history of coryza and clinical finds from infected chickens also is used in the disease diagnosis.Bragg R R, Greyling J M, Verschoor J A.

In other areas culling of the whole flock is a good means of the disease control. Bacterin also is used at a dose of two to reduce brutality of the disease. Precise exposure has also has been used but it should be done with care. Vaccination of the chicks is done in areas with high disease occurrence.

He was President of the International Sociological Association's Sociology of Religion Research Committee from 1974-1978. In 1978, Mol gave the Paine Lecture at the University of Missouri and was opening speaker at the International Conference for the Sociology of Religion in Tokyo, Japan. In 1985, he was the keynote speaker for the 15th World Congress of the International Association for the History of Religions. Mol is listed as an important figure in the social sciences, receiving dedicated entries in publications such as Encyclopaedia of Religion and Society and Sociology of Religion: An Historical Introduction.  Biography  Hans Mol was born on 14 February 1922 in Rozenburg, Netherlands to Johannis Jacob Mol and Jacoba Jobbina de Koster. After gymnasium in Tiel, Mol attended the University of Amsterdam from 1941 to 1943. However, these studies were interrupted by the Nazi occupation of The Netherlands. Mol refused to sign allegiance to the Nazi party, as all university students were expected to do, and was sent to work in Kleinwanzleben at a sugar factory. There, he and his roommates were eventually detained by the Gestapo for having listened to BBC radio broadcasts on a forbidden radio hidden in their room. Mol was sent to a prison camp called Rothensee for three weeks before spending two years as a prisoner in both Magdeburg and Halle. He was released in March 1945 and immigrated to Australia in 1948 where he resumed his studies, this time in theology at the United Theological Faculty of Sydney University. Mol was ordained into the Presbyterian Church in Australia on 27 February 1952 and married Ruth McIntyre on his birthday in 1953. Moving to the United States in 1954, he completed a Bachelor of Divinity degree at Union Theological Seminary, a joint Master's in Christian Ethics at Union (with Reinhold Niebuhr) and Columbia University (1955), and a PhD in Sociology at Columbia with Robert K. Merton as his supervisor (1960). Mol's first academic position was at Canterbury University (New Zealand), followed by positions at Australian National University and McMaster University (Canada). He also filled in for Thomas O‚ÄôDea at University of California, Santa Barbara in 1969. He retired from McMaster in 1987. In 2010, Mol was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He died at the age of 95 on 26 November 2017.  Sociological contribution  John A. Coleman's 1998 Furfey Lecture of the Association for the Sociology of Religion mentions Hans Mol alongside Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch, Talcott Parsons, and Peter Berger as \\"sociology of religion's 'usual suspects,'\\" and the Sage Handbook of the Sociology of Religion, likewise, introduces its discussion of the relationship of identity to religion with a brief mention of Mol. Indeed, Mol is best known for his identity theory of religion which was outlined in the 1976 book Identity and the Sacred. The book is frequently noted as laying out the first general theory of religion in which the concept of identity is central. In Mol's view identity is a fundamental building block of human experience. Thus, his theory of religion begins with identity as a sense of stability, order, and place in a potentially chaotic environment. He adopts a dialectical model then, pitting the ideal stability of identity against the differentiating and destabilising forces of social life. Religion fits into this dialectic by essentially balancing these two opposed forces. In order to ensure the sustained meaningfulness of one's identity, religion has to remain adaptable to those potentially destabilising forces. As Mol states it, \\"religion is‚Ä¶the sacralization of identity.\\" By \\"sacralisation\\", Mol means that religion is able to fit myths, rituals, and emotion-based commitments into a transcendent worldview that buttresses whatever is providing a sense of stable identity. Although some scholars argued that Mol was a functionalist, this definition of religion avoided being easily classified as either substantive or functionalist. It also led Mol to question the mid-20th-century secularization thesis because, for him, religion was not relegated to traditional institutions but to an existential drive to protect one's identity by making it sacred and untouchable. Thus, religion would likely remain relevant.

She played four consecutive Spanish Cup finals, winning in 1981 and 1982. She is third all-time scorer in Cup finals, with 102 points. She was one of the first professional players of the Spanish league.  Club career and gender controversy Born and raised in Valladolid, she tried basketball after seeing Miles Aiken play. She signed for Celta de Vigo at 20. In her debut season in October 1976 she scored 20, 37 and 24 points in her first three games. On January 28, 1977, after beating Evax in Barcelona she was accused of being a man by the Evax team. Her abilities, speed, jump, and overall physical appearance were totally different to the rest of the league players, raising doubts about her sexuality in rival teams, but she and her teammates always defended that she was a woman. She claimed she had received a hormonal treatment in her youth and she always refused to go through a medical examination. Her club suspected that the powerful Catalan teams of the time contributed to the controversy because Celta de Vigo was seen as a threat to their domination in the league. Press of the time were particularly interested in the topic, even appearing on the cover of Don Bal√≥n magazine, an influential weekly sports magazine printed in Barcelona. In the 1982-83 season the Spanish Federation imposed a medical examination for all players of the league, but she refused to go through any of them and retired from professional sport at 27 years of age. She tried long jump and returned to basketball a few more years in Lugo, playing for Arjeriz Xuncas in a lower division where no medical examinations where required.  National team  She made her debut with Spain women's national basketball team at the age of 22, a few months after the controversy in the league. She played with the senior team for 4 years, from 1977 to 1980, with a total of 23 caps and 11.7 PPG. Despite being the best Spanish player of her time, she never participated in a final tournament, even though Spain qualified for the 1978 and 1980 European Championships.

Two men were sent into town to secure a pastor for the outstation and Pastor John Henwood returned with them to take up ministry. The community was officially recognised as an outstation after the former Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was pressed in a public forum by community members to define the population numbers that would constitute an outstation. This enabled the securing of much needed funds for infrastructure. Later the community was recognised as a major community and campaigned for resources, which led to the construction of a school. In 1985 the community became incorporated under the Aboriginal Council Association Act.

He was the forefather of the T√∫z de Lak noble family, which flourished in the 15th century. Life He was born into the so-called T√∫z (or Somogy) branch of the gens (clan) B≈ë, which originated from Somogy County, and was one of the ancient ethnic Hungarian kindreds which had participated in the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in late 9th century. His father was John I, the first known member of the clan. Izs√©p had three children: John II (fl. 1241‚Äì82), Henry (who owned K√∂lked) and a daughter, who married Aladar of Bay. Through his great-great grandson, Peter (fl. 1331‚Äì49), the T√∫z family descended from Izs√©p, in addition to the less significant L√©tai, S√∂rnyei, Sz√∂cs√©nyi and Messer kinships.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus B≈ë 1., Somogy branch 1‚Äì3.) Izs√©p was a confidant of Prince Coloman, the younger brother of B√©la IV of Hungary. In 1226, he appeared as a pristaldus (royal commissioner or \\"bailiff\\") during a revisory act of royal land donations, when B√©la, still as Duke of Transylvania, started reclaiming his father King Andrew II's land grants throughout the country. Sometimes after Coloman was made Duke of Slavonia in that year, Izs√©p became the Master of the cupbearers in his court. Izs√©p acquired the village of Gyugy through royal donation sometime between 1236 and 1241. According to a royal charter from 1268, he still held the dignity, when perished in the Battle of Mohi against the invading Mongols on 11 April 1241.

His son John also wounded in the skirmish, but he managed to survive. Memory Izs√©p is honored as founder and high-impact possessor in Gyugy, Somogy County. Local traditions attributed the construction of the local church, which was built at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, according to archaeological excavations, to the person of Izs√©p.

Since its inception in 2012 until its demise in 2017, the company promoted a range of shows; utilizing events through South West England, and occasionally in wider Europe  Style  The promotion is well known for its liberal use of United Kingdom- based wrestlers, and international stars (Such as Jim Duggan, Mr. Anderson and Rob Van Dam). The style of the events can be best described as traditional sports entertainment, with events designed to be 'fun for all ages', suitable for families, as opposed to the more 'extreme' or alternative style which is marketed at older viewers (See Extreme Championship Wrestling.)  Catch Division Wrestling  The company is also different from other similar wrestling companies for its 'catch division' championship. Rather than a midcard title based on a weight (Such as All Japan Pro Wrestling's Junior Heavyweight Championship, or World Championship Wrestling's Cruiserweight championship), and is more in line with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's X-Division Championship; which stated the division was 'not about weight limits, it's about no limits!\\" The catch division, was likely originally designed as a showcase of catch wrestling; rather than high-flying wrestling, with well known grapplers Johnny Kidd (wrestler) and Doug Williams winning the title. The style however, has changed over the duration of the belt's longevity; with the aforementioned catch style, with a mix of luchador, Puroresu and even more 'extreme styles'. This is reflected in the match types contested for this championship; with \\"catch as catch can\\" wrestling style (See Mountevans Rules), Luchas de Apuestas and even TLC matches. The division's prize is a catch division trophy, and not a traditional belt.  History   Formation  Pride was founded in 2012 by Darren Ferguson. Having been an independent wrestler since 2009 under the ring name 'Darren Saviour' wanted to create a brand of pro wrestling for the South West of England. The name of the company was designed not to be territorial, and thus given the name Pride; in direct comparison to the local companies Devon Wrestling Association, and Plymouth Wrestling Alliance (Now Association). The companies first show was actually not an official production under the Pro Wrestling Pride banner. It was a mixed boxing and professional wrestling show based in the Plymouth Guildhall named 'Plymouth Prizefighters 2'. The event was not advertised as a Pride event; however the event was agreed as cannon in the companies history as it was featured on the companies YouTube channel and could be considered a pilot episode. The 'Prizefighters' name would go on to be used for the companies annual knockout tournament (See \\"Early Years\\") The first show advertised under the Pro Wrestling Pride name took place on 13 May 2012, in Fergusson's home town of Teignmouth; which featured the companies' first championship match; with Tyler Hawke besting 'Wild Boar' Mike Hitchman for the PWP Catch Division Championship. It was also notable for local Devon wrestler Joel Redman having his last match in the UK on the show before signing with WWE under the NXT brand. Redman would later return to the UK in 2015 having been the first NXT Tag Team Champions with partner Adrian Neville.  Early Years (2012-14)  PWP would run two more shows in 2012, the events taking place in the Carlton Theatre, Teignmouth. These events would take place on the 25/26 August weekend; and would feature US based wrestler Josef Von Schmidt. Schmidt would defeat Tyler Hawke for the championship during the weekender, and defend the championship in the United States against A.R. Fox. The PWP Heavyweight Championship was also established won by Crediton wrestler Chris Andrews in a fatal-4 Way Match. In 2013, the company would branch out to new towns, cities and venues. Running shows in Exeter (Exeter Corn Exchange) establishing the PWP Tag Team Championships, Totnes (Totnes Civic Hall), featuring the companies first No Disqualification Match - With a Texas Tornado Tag Team Match and Torquay (Town Hall.) This trend would continue through 2014; with the 'adrenaline rush' tour, with three new locations in three days; before the brand's first venture outside of Devon. The show was to take place in Saltash, Cornwall, and would be the first instance of the annual 'Prize Fighters' Tournament, an 8-person Single-elimination tournament in the span of one night; reminiscent of the King Of The Ring Tournament. May 2014 had to date the companies' only Luchas de Apuestas match; with a championship vs mask \\"I Quit\\" match for the Catch Division Trophy. However, the match ended with a traditional title change, and not an unmasking. The match would take place at 'Pride and Glory 2014', an event that has marked the companies spiritual anniversary every year, if not its chronological anniversary. Before the end of 2014, Pride held an event featuring former Extreme Championship Wrestling alumnus Raven, promoting the show as the stars final event in the UK. At the time, the star had not wrestled for over a year, and had considered retiring. Raven would actually return to Pride two year later; having only wrestled in the United States in between. Heroes and Legends Late in 2014, Pride would return to Saltash, and promote a match between then Catch Division Champion Dick Riley, and Ring Of Honor Television Champion Jay Lethal for both championships. Despite neither championship changing hands, this is the first instance of an outside championship being defended on a Pride wrestling event. This would be followed by a TNA Tag Team Championships Match in 2015, with The American Wolves defending. With the size of crowds escalating, the next project had been conceived; known as 'Heroes & Legends' (Sometimes shortened to \\"\\"H&L;\\", an event with multiple high-profile wrestling stars, and WWE Hall Of Fame members. Featuring Rockstar Spud, Chris Masters, Roderick Strong & Jim Duggan the event was a success; with over 800 in attendance, over double the size of any Pride crowd before it. The event also saw multiple time TNA World Heavyweight Champion Mr. Anderson win the Pride Heavyweight Championship, although he would lose the championship four weeks later in Truro. With the success of \\"H&L;\\"; the second titled show was designed for later that year. This event featured a main event of Rhyno against Steve Griffiths for the championship, as well as a plethora of talent, including Hall Of Famer Ted DiBiase. The event would catch on, and become a bi-annual event. Growth, Hiatus & Eventual Demise (2016-2017) Towards the end of 2015, Pride would do its first show outside of Devon or Cornwall, where they would appear in Taunton, Somerset; which would then hold three shows in January with Kenny Omega (who would be awarded a 5-star match by Pro Wrestling Illustrated that year) and WWE Hall of Famer Tatanka, July featuring Rob Van Dam in front of over 800 people, and in October with Adam Rose Pride would promote 25 shows in the year of 2016, despite taking the month of November off. Pride would also introduce a female only championship; with Nadia Sapphire winning the Pride Women's Championship in October 2016. However, despite crowd attendances growing and United Kingdom wrestling being its strongest since the 1980s, increasing competition and heightened number of events required more events to feature international wrestlers than ever before. This in turn effected Pride and in September 2017, the company fell into hiatus as owner Darren Ferguson placed the company in a state of hiatus owing to debts surrounding the shows. Despite saying that he would be \\"closing down all future live events\\", he has also stated that the company would start up again once issues had been resolved. The company's last shows before the hiatus included a three-day tour with shows in Taunton, Launceston and Plymouth, with the last being the 5th iteration of the Heroes and Legends event. These shows included guest appearances from Simon Gotch, Carlito and Joey Ryan.  International Events  Despite being a regional touring product; based in the South West of England, Pride has promoted shows in Europe outside of the UK. The first of these, being the 2015 international Brussels Tattoo Convention, and then again in February 2016 taking a team to co-promote two shows in Lisbon based Centro De Treinos De Wrestling. The team they would take included regular Pride members Saviour himself, Jigsaw, Ultimo Tiger, Cy Gregory and even Senior Referee Ed Dyer.

(K&M;) was an industrial transportation company that operated from 1960 to 1981 in Burlington County, New Jersey. After cleaning their trucks, they dumped the waste water into a nearby lagoon that was not properly lined. The lagoon flooded and the waste water containing chemicals, migrated over to wetlands, causing damage to vegetation and seeping into underground drinking water. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) got involved in 1989 and conducted a few remediation attempts but the extent of the damage is hard to determine as the different underground pathways of water are unpredictable. The site is currently an active superfund site that is closely monitored by the EPA. Origins Kauffman & Minteer Inc. (K&M;) had of land right off of County Route 537 in the Jobstown section of Springfield Township. There is a lagoon onsite and the land is surrounded by wetlands. (K&M;) used the land to store their trucks that they used to transport chemicals. Community history Jobstown is a small community located in Springfield Township, Burlington County, New Jersey. Springfield Township was established on November 6, 1688and is composed of 29.940 square miles of land and only about 0.061 square miles of water. The company was located in a rural area with the closest home away and a total of 184 homes within a radius. Company history Kauffman & Minteer inc. (K&M;) transported a variety of bulk liquids including plasticizers, resins, vegetable oil, petroleum oil, organic chemicals and alcohols according to the New Jersey Department of Health. Even though (K&M;) had a permit from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), they failed to comply with many other rules and regulations. The company cleaned their vehicles and dumped the wastewater into the lagoon nearby which did not have a proper retention basin which is used as a storage area of excess water in case of a flood. Superfund designation  The NJDEP first issued an administrative order to have the waste water properly treated and removed offsite. Three years later they returned to see the progress and teamed up with the Burlington County health department. In 1984, the berm surrounding the lagoon broke and due to that the wastewater leaked out into the surrounding wetlands and it was calculated that the lagoon dropped 18 inches before they were able to fix the berm. A berm is a strip of land surrounding the lagoon that is above the water level. Once the berm broke, the Environmental protection agency (EPA) stepped in and conducted a study on site, which led to (K&M;) being added to the National Priority List (NPL) on March 30, 1989. State intervention On June 2, 1978 the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) issued an administrative order to Kauffman & Minteer Inc. (K&M;). The order required them to properly treat and then dispose of the wastewater on site, in agreement with the state's regulations and requirements. K&M; was also given a discharge permit from the National pollution discharge elimination system that allowed them to relocate the waste to Barkers Brook which is a mitigation bank located close to the K&M; superfund site in Springfield Township. K&M; had to report the progress every year for the next five years. On April 13, 1981, the NJDEP went back to the K&M; site and recorded that there was oil contamination in the lagoon and that there was debris in the surrounding area. In April 1982, K&M; began relocating the wastewater and during the relocation, tests were conducted that showed significantly high levels of lead and calcium which were above the state's hazardous limit. After that, the NJDEP partnered with the Burlington County Health Department and conducted even more tests. On June 1, 1984 the berm of the lagoon broke and the wastewater rushed out of the lagoon into nearby wetlands that are very susceptible to damage due to chemicals. The Lagoon lost approximately 18 inches of water before the bern could be fixed. After this occurred, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stepped in. National intervention A year after the berm broke, the Environmental Protection agency (EPA) performed a site inspection and deemed that this catastrophe met the criteria to join the National Priorities list (NPL) on March 30, 1989. The EPA performed more inspections in June 1989 and April 1991. The conditions remained the same from the first to the second site inspection. Health and environmental hazards Throughout numerous studies conducted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Burlington County Health department in New Jersey, a plethora of chemicals were discovered on and near the site of contamination. Concerned members of the community feared their water was contaminated, complaining that their water had a smell to it. However, multiple tests were conducted in three different wells varying in depths and resulted in no groundwater contamination. The only confirmed impact on the environment was the presence of sludge and oils covering the soil and nearby wetlands. The chemicals were not confirmed to have caused any harm to animals or people in the surrounding area. Chemicals in lagoon Tests showed that chemicals in the lagoon included bis(2-chloroisopropyl) ether 28 parts per billion (ppb), benzoic acid (200 ppb), trans-1,2-dichloroethene (260 ppb), tetrachloroethylene (170 ppb), toluene (120 ppb), ethylbenzene (750 ppb), styrene (470 ppb), xylenes ( 1,300 ppb), phenanthrene (6,200 ppb), di-n- butylphthalate (55,600 ppb), endosulfan sulfate (141 ppb), DDT (43 ppb), chlorotoluene (103 ppb), as well as some phthalates and unidentified chemicals. None of these chemicals have been confirmed to cause harm to people or animals in the surrounding area. Parts per billion is a measurement of quantity meaning that out of one billion particles found in a given area, only a certain amount of them are the contaminants. Contaminants in soil According to the New Jersey Department of Health ‚ÄúContaminants detected in the sludges and sediments of the pit area in 1986 included di-n-octyl phthalate (77,000 ppb), di-n-butyl phthalate (790 ppb), xylenes (11,000 ppb) ethylbenzene (9,800 ppb), 1,1,1-tri-chloroethane (12,000 ppb), and numerous unidentified compounds.‚Äù According to the EPA, ‚ÄúThe only contaminant-related ecological impact observed was to some flora in the lagoon-fed marsh. This stressed area was an isolated section adjacent to the lagoon. Obvious signs of phytotoxicity and adverse impacts were yellow, withered vegetation, and vegetation stained black from the overflow of lagoon contents.‚Äù In other words, the only impact on the environment observed was staining of vegetation, causing it to be yellow, black, or brown due to the different metals and chemicals that the wetlands were exposed to. Volatile chemical The only volatile organic compound found in the water was trichloroethylene at 24 ppb. The Discovery of this chemical in the water was in 1984 and it was in such a low quantity that Kauffman & Minteer Inc. (K&M;) could not have been held accountable because the presence of this chemical was most likely due to another source such as a septic tank. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, trichloroethylene can be harmless in very small quantities and very harmful in large quantities. The effect it has on people also depends on the person's age, sex, lifestyle, state of health, and family traits. Trichloroethylene can cause scleroderma which is a systemic autoimmune disease that causes joint pain, skin stiffness, and heartburn. In animals, exposure to trichloroethylene can impact the liver, nervous system, kidneys, and blood. Trichloroethylene at 24 ppb is in such a small quantity that it did not have harmful affects on people and animals in the nearby area of the contamination site. Clean-up Initial clean-up The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted several cleanup procedures between 1991 and 1998. They removed 656,000 gallons of water from the lagoon and properly disposed of it. They also removed 17,500 tons of contaminated soil from the area and build protective fencing surrounding the contaminated site. To add to that, they performed on-site treatment of wastewater and contaminated soil by injecting chemical oxidants in an effort to clean up the site in a long term manner. Current site status According to the location map (Superfund Site location map on the National Geographic website, accessed on September 27, 2017), Kauffman & Minteer Inc. (K&M;) is still currently an active superfund site. Although many remediation actions have been conducted and there have been no reports of further contamination, the site is still closely monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The site is located in Rockaway Borough, Morris County, New Jersey. It was first found to be an official Superfund site after it was discovered that tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) were contaminating the soil. Studies suspected that the chemicals were coming from the area of two companies in the town of Rockaway. In 1985, the residents of Rockaway were advised not to drink the tap water and the National Guard had to come and supply water supplies for the community. The town soon installed a water filter system in order to try to reduce the amount of pollution in the water. After finding that the system was not effective, the NJDEP (New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection) came to the scene to investigate the soil. NJDEP found that the soil tested positive with chemicals and from there the EPA were contacted. The EPA found chemicals in different areas of the borough and found that the soil was contaminated and began to install a groundwater treatment system that functioned to purify the ground of chemicals. The system was soon pumping up to 900,000 gallons of water from the boroughs wells. Today, the pump is still functioning and has since reduced the amount of chemicals and the chance of pollution in the water to appear again. The final project to completely purify the water is still in production.  Origin   Town history  The town of Rockaway is located in Morris County, New Jersey. It is located in the 11th Congressional District and part of New Jerseys 25th state legislative district. Rockaway is about 2.072 square miles of land and 0.47 square miles of water. The mayor currently is Russell Greuter and Rockaway is populated with close to 6,500 residents. The town was first established in 1730 and was later named Rockaway Borough. The town quickly became a main center for vendors, retailers, and traders. The main street in Rockaway soon was filled with different stores and businesses.  Company history  Klockner & Klockner (K&K;) is a real estate holding company that was founded by Daniel Klockner Jr, in the 1950s when several industrial buildings were constructed. K&K; is local to Rockaway, NJ. Properties owned by Klockner & Klockner were occupied by numerous tenants since the buildings were constructed. K&K; never occupied any of the properties. Another company that opened in the same area was Lusardi‚Äôs Cleaners Inc. which is a small dry cleaners. When tests on the soil came into action, many signs pointed toward properties owned by these companies for being responsible based on the locations of the companies.  Superfund designation In 1981, the town of Rockaway was restricted to using their drinking water due to warnings of contaminants in the water. The National Guard was contacted to help provide water supplies for the residents until the town installed a water treatment system to attempt to clean out the contaminants from the water.  State intervention  The NJDEP (New Jersey Department of Environmental Production), in 1985, performed tests on the soil and water and found that the contaminants were coming from different areas of the Borough. The NJDEP kept improving the water treatment system until the EPA were contacted after the site made the EPA‚Äôs National Priorities.  National intervention  The EPA began performing tests and investigating the soil and found high traces of perchloroethylene (tetrachloroethylene/PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), lead, and chromium. After finding these chemicals in the water, the EPA installed their own groundwater treatment system in effort to purify the water more thoroughly than NJDEP‚Äôs.  Health and environmental hazards  The EPA‚Äôs investigation on the Rockaway Borough Well field Superfund site found high traces of trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, lead, and chromium. These chemicals can cause long term damage and can result in lethal illnesses. Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a non-flammable halocarbon that is used as an industrial solvent to remove grease from metal. Exposure to TCE can cause problems in the liver, immune system, kidneys, and the central nervous system. Perchloroethylene (PCE) is a chemical that can be found in industrial solvents and also in dry cleaning fabrics. Exposure can be caused if using dry cleaning products, shoe polish, wood cleaners and other products. High levels of exposure to PCE can cause damage to the central nervousness and can lead to a coma with a lethal outcome. Lead is a grayish metal that can be found in the ground or in clusters of rock in the earth. Lead is used in products including batteries, pipes, metal parts, and many more. Lead is used in some utensils and cosmetic products which can lead to exposure. Short term effects are headaches, trouble sleeping, high blood pressure, and can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat. Chromium is an element that is found in many natural resources and is used in many dyes and pigments. Chromium can be found naturally in some foods like vegetables, meats, and fruits. Consumption of chromium can cause kidney damage, liver damage, increased chances of lung cancer, and ulcers.  Cleanup  The town of Rockaway Borough‚Äôs initial action to the contamination of the water in 1981 was to install a carbon water treatment system to get rid of the pollution in the water. In 1986, further studies proceeded to improve the process of purification and investigations soon found that the pollution was coming from two spots in the borough. The goal was to install extraction wells in both of the locations and to start purifying the water to the point where it can be put back and be available for consumption. Then keep the water thoroughly monitored in order to make sure it stays pure and clear of pollution. The process to get these systems installed into the two locations began in 1991. Currently the water treatment system has reduced the amount of pollution in the water enormously. Currently the process of the last project to purity the whole area and open it back up to the public is still in production.

It was used as a wood treatment facility. Starting in 1919, the site was contaminated with creosote. Creosotes are a category of carbonaceous chemicals formed by the distillation of various tars and by pyrolysis of plant-derived material, such as wood or fossil fuel. They are typically used as preservatives or antiseptics. It took the EPA about 18 years to cleanup the site.  Origins  The Superfund site was a former wood treatment facility in Manville, New Jersey. It was later developed into homes and a shopping center, where creosote was discovered.  Town history  Manville, New Jersey is a borough in Somerset County. The site was located in areas that in 1960 were later known as Claremont Development and Rustic Mall. Claremont Development is the residential area where homes were built and Rustic Mall is a shopping center. It lays on a 50 acre property. In 1997 a sinkhole emerged at the development. Creosote was discovered during removal of soil near the sinkhole.  Company history  The Federal Creosoting Company was a wood treatment facility. They treated railroad ties and telephone poles. The site had a number of buildings and above ground tanks that contained creosote. The creosote went into two lagoons and the treated wood would drip into the soil.  Superfund designation   State intervention  In 1996 when homeowners were living at the site, a man discovered a tar like substance coming from his sump pump. It was soon discovered to be creosote, which is considered a hazardous chemical. This brought attention to the EPA of the issues left behind from the Federal Creosote Site. They started to test the surrounding areas and found creosote in 31 of the 137 homes. In response, by 1998 the site was proposed to the National Priorities List by the EPA. In 1999 it made it onto the list. Eight months later EPA decided their course of action and two days later they started the cleanup. Homes and businesses needed to be relocated during this time. Public funds helped to fund all of the work that was done.  National intervention  The EPA designated the location a Superfund site and its intention to cleanup the site by 2014. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection deemed the site to have no significant threat to public health or the environment.  Health and environmental hazards  Creosote was found in the soil and groundwater of the areas surrounding where the site used to be. When in action, the substance would release into lagoons and drip on the top layer of the soil. This later had a dangerous effect on homeowners in the development.  Groundwater  Creosote containing chemicals such as NPH dispersed into lagoons and it became dangerous for anyone drinking and coming in contact with the groundwater.  Soil  Chemicals (nph) leaked into soil and also formed sludge that was dangerous to anyone exposed. It caused families to relocate due to health problems. One man had the sludge coming out of his sump pump.  Cleanup  The clean up process had three phases which were all completed successfully. The site is now habitable, and everyone was able to move back into the development.  Initial cleanup  Cleanup was done in three phases. \\"In Phase 1, source material from subsurface disposal canals and lagoons was removed from residential properties and borough right-of-ways. In Phase 2, residual levels of contaminants in soil above the cleanup goals were removed from residential properties. In Phase 3, source material and residually contaminated soils were removed from the Rustic Mall property.\\" The site has been removed from the list and is habitable again.  Current status  The steps taken in the clean up have allowed for the site to be deemed clear and safe for humans to live on again. All of the unsafe exposure has been controlled and there is prevention of coming into contact with these substances. Controversy A man was indicted for a kickback scheme during the cleanup of the site. The individual was paid to pick a specific subcontractor, which the EPA unknowingly paid for.

The Landfill was put on the National Priority List by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) in September 1983 due to the site being tested for potentially dangerous chemicals, such as benzene, methylene chloride, and chloroform. Despite attempts to clean up, the site has remained an active Superfund as of September 25, 2017.  Origin  Combe Fill South is located around from the Borough of Chester, and is both part of Chester and Washington townships in Morris County. The area around this landfill does not have a very high population density. The original company that owned Combe South Fill is Filiberto Sanitation Incorporated. The townships of Chester and Washington both relied on the Combe Fill South landfill for over 40 years. However, in the early 1980s it was found out that Combe Fill South had been polluting the groundwater for a very long time (EPA, Combe Fill South Landfill).  Company origins  In the 1940s, the site was used as a place for smaller waste-collecting vehicles to transfer their waste to the larger waste collecting vehicles, and was owned by the Filiberto family. The site was then converted into a landfill, which was operated by Filiberto Sanitation Incorporated in 1970 and 1971. However, due to a fish kill in the nearby Trout Brook, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection gave the rights of operation of a sanitary landfill to Chester Hills Incorporated. In 1978, operation of the landfill changed again, this time from Chester Hills Incorporated to the Combe Fill Corporation. And in 1981, Combe Fill Corporation declared bankruptcy and ceased the operation of Combe Fill South. Though not proven, it is thought by many that pressure from environmental activists led to the end of the Combe Fill Corporation (EPA, Site Review and Update, 1-2).  Superfund site designation  Starting in 1972, once Chester Hill Incorporated started to run the landfill, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Bureau of Solid Waste started its inspections of the Combe Fill South Landfill. These inspections started because of the recent Fish Kill in Trout Brook, which is not far from Combe Fill South. The inspections continued until 1981, when the inspections turned into an analysis of groundwater and nearby surface water sites (EPA, Site Review and Update, 1-2). Due to these tests, which had found multiple dangerous chemicals in the groundwater, the United States Environmental Protection Agency made the Combe Fill South landfill an official Superfund Site (EPA, Combe Fill South Landfill).  State intervention  1977, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection persuaded Chester Hills Incorporated to install two wells for observation and sampling of groundwater on the site. These wells proved that not only did groundwater contamination exist, but had most likely spread to local water sources. In 1981, samples taken from 90 potable wells were taken, and most contained a list of contaminates including but not limited to benzene, chloroform, methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, as well as other volatile organic compounds (EPA, Site Review and Update, 1-3).  National intervention  In cooperation with the NJDEP, the United States Environmental Protection Agency placed Combe Fill South on the National Priority List as a Superfund Site (EPA, Combe Fill South Landfill).  Health and environmental hazard  Data collected by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1980 shows that the average amount of dissolved solids in the 5 wells they studied is around 228 per well (Ziegler, 1-4). The wells had multiple violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act, which was made by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, Site Review and Update, 2-3).  Chloroform  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, chloroform can enter the air from the process of chlorination. Short-term exposure to chloroform can lead to central nervous system depression, while long term exposure can lead to hepatitis, jaundice, and effects on the central nervous system (EPA, Chloroform).  Clean up  Initial Cleanup of Combe Fill South began with the construction of a remedy in 1997. Groundwater extraction and treatment started in June of that same year. Since then, the method of air quality treatment changed from an active system to a passive system (EPA, Combe Fill South Landfill).  Initial cleanup  Along with the remedy, the state provided water treatment to residents close to Combe Fill South (EPA, Site Review and Update, 9). This is the beginning of a six part plan to clean up the site, which also includes covering the site with a material such as clay to prevent rain water from coming in contact with the buried waste, treating the groundwater and leachate, and determining if the aquifer nearby needs treatment (EPA, Combe Fill South Landfill).  Current status  The Combe Fill South landfill has been undergoing treatment by the EPA since 1997, but has not yet been taken off the National Priority List. There are currently a study on the deep water aquifer taking place, which will help the EPA determine what the next plan of action is (EPA, Combe Fill South Landfill).

Polymer manufacturing site is located in Sparta Township, New Jersey. This facility created special polymers, plastics, and resins. It was also used for reclaiming spent solvents. The facility‚Äôs poor waste handling led to serious contamination of the ground. It also contaminated the water in the ground with volatile organic compounds. The site has been a threat to the Allentown aquifer, which provides drinking water to over 5,000 people. Initial clean ups started with getting rid of old drums and contaminants from their original disposal area. The company took them and decided to dispose of them elsewhere, thus not fixing the problem. Primary cleanups of the site were ongoing as of 2008. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has been using water pumps to remove contaminants from the water in the ground. A soil extraction system has been put at their disposal to remove harmful contamination within the soil as well. All wells in the affected areas have been closed. Origins The town of Sparta, New Jersey, was a small settlement dating back to the Native Americans. It was later established as a full township in 1845 and was popular for its role in the mining industry for decades. The township is home to the A.O. Polymer Corporation, which was a resin production facility that dumped liquid hazardous wastes into nearby disposal sites. This led to the contamination of groundwater and soil, affecting wells that provide drinking water to Sparta and nearby towns that received water from the Allentown Aquifer. Town history Sparta was established as a township in New Jersey in April 1845 after being a settlement for years prior. The land was settled by the Dutch who met the Lenape Native Americans. It used to be big in the mining industry, being popular for iron, limestone and zinc over the course of a century. The population has grown by thousands each decade since establishment. It‚Äôs located in the Highlands region of New Jersey in Sussex County. Sparta is known for a large number of pilots living there or in the vicinity of the town. It is a home for countless small businesses such as pizzerias and other eateries; these provide a stable economy for the community. Company history A.O. Polymer Corporation is a facility that produced various resins, plastics, solvents, polymers and other artificial materials. The company had operated in Sparta Township from the early 1960s all the way to 1994, according to official EPA documentation. A.O. Polymer was found to have poor habits of waste handling from their factory and they poured liquid wastes into their disposal pits. The dump site that the company had used had contaminants seep into the soil and all the way into the groundwater which affected water wells in Sparta. This became apparent in the 1970s and on September 1, 1983, the site was placed on the National Priorities List. Superfund designation The state intervened, and its handling of the disposal was immensely inadequate. As a result of this, the EPA stepped in to properly take control of the situation. They took immediate actions to better the site and rid it of contaminations. They removed tons of waste and contaminated materials from the early 1980s to the early 2000s. State intervention In 1981 the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection had removed the contents of A.O. Polymer‚Äôs disposal pits and disposed of them elsewhere. They removed roughly 3,100 tons of contaminated soil and around 900 drums from the disposal site. The NJDEP just moved the problem to a new location rather than fixing it. The state‚Äôs inadequate handling in response to the contamination prompted intervention from the EPA. National intervention The EPA moved in to begin short-term removal processes in 1982. The EPA took immediate action by addressing the health threats that the hazardous waste left in the abandoned sites. They then removed 34,000 pounds of hazardous waste and 37,600 pounds of non-hazardous waste from the site, as well as hazardous fluids and materials containing asbestos. In September 1983, the site was listed in the National Priorities list by the EPA. Long-term removal actions consisted of using a soil vapor extraction system which was activated in 1995 and is still in use. This helped to clean up over 345 million gallons of contaminated water from the ground. The EPA pushed to further clean up the site after the owner abandoned it in 1994. Health and environmental hazards The contaminants dumped by A.O. Polymer affected water in the ground as well as the soil under the disposal pits. This contaminated water for Sparta and surrounding communities. Contaminated groundwater The hazardous waste dumped by A.O. Polymer initially contaminated soil and groundwater. The contamination of the water led to the contamination of the Allentown Aquifer, including the wells in and around Sparta Township. This led to the site becoming a problem for more than just Sparta, but for the surrounding area too. The EPA was able to get this under control by stabilizing contaminated groundwater using a groundwater treatment system. There is no longer any hazardous discharge to surface water as of 2008. Soil contamination In the summer of 1993, a large soil gas investigation was carried out. These proved volatile organic contaminants were present beneath the ground of dump sites. This was not a great concern because it did not threaten any life above ground, but it goes to show the extent of the contamination. Cleanup The EPA stepped in to clean up the A.O. Polymer site as quick as possible after the NJDEP failed to do so. They removed a majority of the contaminants and set up systems to clean the soil and groundwater for the future. Progress reports on the site have closed and the site was sold for redevelopment. Initial cleanup The state's only attempt to clean up the site was taking the waste and putting somewhere else, thus not fixing the problem. The EPA intervened in 1982 and removed of hazardous waste, of non-hazardous waste, 91 cubic yards of materials with asbestos, 121 cubic yards of contaminated soil and of hazardous liquids. Also, a soil evaporation system was placed in 1995 and has been removing contaminants from the soil beneath the waste pits since 1995. A groundwater treatment system decontaminated nearly 350 million gallons of groundwater since 1998. Current status After being on the National Priorities List for 17 years, the EPA removed the facility part of the site from the list in 2000, but the site as a whole is still there. Most reports on the site have closed since 2008 with the latest being in 2013. The former A.O. Polymer site was sold privately in 2009 to undergo reconstruction. As of September 2017, the site has still not achieved readiness for reuse and redevelopment. References External links  * Superfund sites in New Jersey Sparta Township, New Jersey ","title":"A.O. Polymer Superfund Site"},{"id":"55455224","text":"Emmell's Septic Landfill (ESL) is located at 128 Zurich Ave, Galloway Township, New Jersey and takes up about 38 acres of space. The landfill was in operation from 1967 until 1979. ESL disposed of liquid and solid waste including many chemicals such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), Trichloroethene and Vinyl chloride which all had their own effect on the environment and community. These chemicals affected the groundwater required millions of dollars to reconstruct the groundwater pathways and provide clean water to residents. The landfill holds a Hazardous Ranking Score of a 50/100, qualifying for the Superfund National Priority List. In August 1999, the state acknowledged the site's contamination and held town meetings and provided research upon the site such as groundwater samples. In July 1997, a sitewide investigation was called upon by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In total the clean up was estimated to cost $5 million to fund this superfund site, and a grant of $3.9 million was given by the Federal Government under the Recovery Act Funding (Previti). Today, the project is still ongoing however, greatly improved since the landfill was discovered.  Origins  Galloway has a population of 37,431 as of 2015 and stands with a total of 115.213 square miles, 89.074 square miles of that being land and 26.139 square miles being water. Emmell's Septic Landfill is located in Galloway Township, occupying 38 acres and operated from 1967 to 1979. ELS disposed of both liquid and solid waste, dropping it into lagoons, ponds and trenches.  Town history  In 1774, the Township of Galloway was allowed to remain a perpetual township and community under the order of King George the third of England. Galloway Township was occupied by indigenous people for thousands of years including the Lenape Native American tribe during the time the Europeans emerged. The town got its name from an assemblyman, Joseph Galloway, whose land Galloway was located on prior to his move to England. As of 2015, Galloway Township had an estimated population of 37,431. The United States Census Bureau recorded Galloway Township having a total of 115.213 square miles, 89.074 square miles of that being land and 26.139 square miles being water. In 1979 Emmell's Septic Landfill was closed and in March and August the NJDHSS and the ATSDR visited the site.  Company history  Emmell's Septic Landfill is located on 128 Zurich Ave,Galloway Township, taking up 38 acres. ESL was in operation from 1967 until 1979. During this time, disposing of waste wherever convenient was common practice and in 1974, the site received a facility permit that authorized them to dispose sewage and septic waste in near waters. Emmell's Septic Landfill began to accept septic and sewage sludge and throw the waste into trenches and lagoons on site. ‚Äú[...] both solid and chemical waste was also disposed of at the landfill, including drums containing paint sludges, gas cylinders, household garbage, and construction debris‚Äù. The landfill was under supervision for enforcement activities by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection from 1976 to 1980, due to the landfill not sending designs for the disposal of waste. In 1980, the public became aware of the pollution and fear was brought upon them, leading the 96th Congress to make the Superfund program to exterminate the contaminated sites. Emmell's Septic Landfill holds a Hazardous Ranking Score of a 50/100, qualifying for the Superfund National Priority List. To qualify for the Superfund National Priority List, a site must receive a score at or above 28.5. Emmell's Septic Landfill was ‚Äúproposed for inclusion on the National Priority List (NPL) in April 1999, and was placed on the NPL on July 22, 1999‚Äù. In 1979 Emmell's Septic Landfill was closed and in March and August the NJDHSS and the ATSDR visited the site.  Superfund designation  The site contamination was acknowledged by the state in August 1999, due to residents becoming concerned with their health upon the knowledge of Emmell's Septic Landfill's chemical waste history. Samples of groundwater were taken from private wells within the landfill site and showed elevated VOC levels, resulting in the NJDEP closing wells within a certain range from the site. In July 1997, a sitewide investigation was called upon by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In total, the clean up was estimated to cost $5 million, and a grant of $3.9 million was given by the Federal Government under the Recovery Act Funding.  State intervention  A community meeting was requested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and conducted on August 17, 1999. At this meeting the sampling from May (1999) was presented and the community was concerned with the safety of the well water and the health effects following. This meeting consisted of members from the community, along with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS), the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) and representatives of Galloway Township. Samples were collected to find out the length of contamination and from 1984 to 1988 samples were retracted from the private wells within the landfill's site. In less than 2,000 feet from the site the ACHD collected samples from residential wells in May and June 1984, showing elevated VOC's levels in the groundwater. With this evidence, the NJDEP closed the wells and established deeper wells ranging about 170‚Äì240 feet.  National intervention  A sitewide investigation was put into place by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in July 1997, and investigated the soil and groundwater to Public Health Assessment to discover the VOC contamination in the downstream residential wells source. The USEPA assessed the groundwater passage to the wells and sampled 31 private wells in 1999. It was estimated to cost up to $5 million to fund this superfund site. The Federal Government gave the site $3.9 million from the Recovery Act Funding, adding up to half the cost of the project.  Health and environmental hazards  The chemicals that Emmell's Septic Lanndfill disposed of included solid and liquid chemical waste. These chemicals included volatile organic compounds (VOCs), Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), Trichloroethene and Vinyl chloride which all had their own effect on the environment and community. Millions of dollars were spent on the reconstruction due to the contamination of groundwater from the chemical waste that the landfill disposed of. Health effects such as cancer, lung and heart issues were resulted from the contamination of these chemicals.  Groundwater contamination  Emmell's Septic Landfill polluted the groundwater in Galloway Township by disposing septic and sewage into trenches and lagoons. This pollution affected the public due to groundwater being the main source of drinking water and irrigation for commercial crops within four miles from the site and at least 100 residents live within one half mile from it and 25 residents within 2,000 feet downstream from it. With people residing so close to the site, it posed a great risk to their health and the environment around them. The contaminated groundwater had traces of harmful compounds above the federal drinking standards, such as volatile organic compounds or VOCs, which evaporate in the air. VOC's are organic compounds that become a gas containing hydrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, sulfur, nitrogen and carbon. VOC's are harmful because they are a form of air pollutants when mixed with nitrogen oxides, forming ground-level ozone, adding to climate change. One element that was prominent in Emmell's Septic Landfill was Trichloroethylene. ‚ÄúTrichloroethylene is a colorless, volatile liquid ‚Ä¶ [that] evaporates quickly into the air‚Äù. Kidney and liver cancer along with malignant lymphoma are lifetime effects that follows trichloroethylene. The National Toxicology Program and the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that trichloroethylene is cancerous to humans, posing a great threat to human health within the area.  Polychlorinated piphenyls  A chemical that was improperly disposed of was polychlorinated biphenyls. Polychlorinated Biphenyls, or PCBs, are a liquid or solid containing a range of clear to a light yellow color and no smell or taste. It has been highly recorded that PCBs can cause acne or rashes when presented at high levels. Those exposed to PCBs in the work environment have reported nose and lung irritation, along with gastrointestinal issues, depression, fatigue and differences in their blood and liver. PCBs were subject to animal testing, recording liver damage and death in rats that consumed PCBs. Evidence of PCBs being associated to cancer in humans, for example liver and biliary tract have been proven in many studies of workers. The Department of Health and Human services, EPA, and the International Agency of Research on Cancer concluded that PCBs are likely to be cancerous to humans. These cancerous chemicals were disposed of in Emmell's Septic Landfill, leading to exposure to the residents of Galloway Township.  Trichloroethene  Another chemical that was improperly disposed of at Emmell's Septic Landfill was that of trichloroethene Trichloroethane contains no color and obtains a sweet smell, consisting of a high boiling point. If trichloroethane is released into the environment, it ends up being broken down into the air, and some cases groundwater too. If in the air, trichloroethane has a 49-day expectation to break down half way, therefore spreading far away from the origin before fully being broken down. If the chemical is underground, it is not expected to break down until about after 16 weeks, or even years. Exposure to trichloroethene can be from breathing it in or direct contact to it on the skin. Temporary side effects include stinging and burning of the skin upon contact. Animal testing has been used when finding out the effects of this chemical and shown that when trichloroethane is in the air or high doses are applied to the skin or ingested, has resulted in death to the animals. Long term effects include effects on the nervous system, liver, kidney, digestive tract, produce skin irritation and the body's ability to fight infections. Animal testing also showed that when given a high dosage, the mice developed liver cancer. The effects on humans are not confirmed, due to human testing not being conducted however, the effects on animals have been deathly and severe. Vinyl chloride is a colorless gas at room temperature and is unstable at high temperatures, and was also a chemical disposed of at the landfill. Studies have shown that when breathed in high levels, vinyl chloride will cause dizziness or sleepiness within 5 minutes, higher doses could cause one to pass out. Vinyl chloride was also tested on animals resulting in liver damage, along with the lungs and kidneys. Vinyl chloride was recorded to prevent blood clotting and damage to the heart and if in contact with the skin can numb the skin and show redness and blisters. These liquid chemicals were waste that Emmell's Liquid Landfill disposed of, leading to contamination to the groundwater of Galloway Township, putting the community at risk to the hazards above.  Cleanup  The EPA's Removal Action Branch began an immediate action in July 1999, which fixed the sources of contamination that were still continuing. With this, the EPA removed all the waste that the landfill had disposed of and removed it from the site to a proper disposal facility. The groundwater was contaminated, leaving the residents unable to consume their water that was supplied from wells. This led to the EPA providing an alternative source of drinking water such as giving residents bottled water. The EPA dug deeper well pipes and connecting some residences‚Äô water supply to a water company supply line. In 2012 the system the EPA provided to maintain safe drinking water was upgraded. As of today this process is still ongoing and has cost over $12 million  Initial cleanup  The EPA's Removal Action Branch, or RAB, executed an immediate action in July, 1999 to fix the sources of contamination that were continuing at the landfill such as the buried drums. The EPA removed the submerged cylinders, paint sludge waste and the contaminated soil and disposed these at a disposal facility away from the site from August 1999 to March 2000. From this, a total of ‚Äú438 drums, 11 gas cylinders and 28,046 cubic yards of soil were addressed. ‚Ä¶ 3,500 gallons of bottled water [was supplied] to six residences near the site‚Äù (Search Superfund Site Information). The EPA asked the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) in August 1999 for the health consequences that Emmell's contamination had caused. It was concluded that Emmell's caused a health hazard through the pathway of groundwater for the time the water was used by residents, but since the wells had closed the risk was no longer applicable. In 2003 the EPA ensured clean drinking water by connecting 36 residences‚Äô water supply to a water company supply line. A few years later, the EPA again took action in 2008 and 2010 by installing deeper wells in a clean aquifer for 7 residents. This decade process was done to insure the safety of the residents by providing clean drinking water due to the main source being ground water and that being so badly contaminated. The EPA investigated eleven parties who were suspected to be involved within the site however, no parties have been identified.  Current status  In 2000, the EPA did a study to see if treatment of the groundwater was needed near the site, and it was concluded that ‚Äú ... a site- related VOC plume consisting primarily of trichloroethene, 1,2-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride as well as petroleum-related VOCs and chlorinated benzene compounds extended east of the landfill‚Äù. A plan to treat the contaminated groundwater was decided in September 2003. This plan called to pump and treat the groundwater, controlling the migration of it off the site. The plan began to operate in September 2010. In 2012, the system was upgraded so the captured groundwater can be treated downstream from the property and today this process is still ongoing. The groundwater extraction system has cured about 573 million gallons of contaminated groundwater, they removed 35,000 tons of PCB- contaminated soil and 42 residents were supplied with an alternate water supply. This process has cost the EPA over $12 million.

It opened up in 1946, but then stopped production in 1979 and has been inactive since then. The refinery was shut down in 1980 and the EPA designated it as a Superfund site in 1991 due to the discovery of toxic chemicals in the soil and the surface water. This created a dangerous work environment for the workers at the facility. The EPA proposed a clean up plan for the site, but it has yet to take effect. So far, the Diamond Head site is still in the process of being cleaned up. Although cleanup plans were discussed and finalized, the future of the Diamond Head Oil Refinery and its cleanup state is unknown. Origins A property purchased by Mayor William Sandford in 1668 became known as Kearny, New Jersey in 1867. The township held a copper mine and was responsible for helping create the steam engines. The township was named after General Phil Kearny of the United States military. The owner of the companies who were in charge of Diamond Head was Robert Mahler. Town history The township of Kearny, New Jersey was created in 1867. Mayor William Sandford obtained the property in 1668. It was then bought in 1701 by Sandford's friend, Mayor Nathaniel Kingsland, who then sold the land to Captain Arent Schuyler. Schuyler opened up a copper mine in the area, and was able to create the first steam engine in America. This steam engine allowed for a deeper mine shaft to be created. When the area became more populated in the nineteenth century, it was named Kearny after Major General Phil Kearny, a United States military officer who served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Company history The Diamond Head Oil Refinery was run under multiple companies: PSC Resources, Inc., Ag-Met Oil Service, Inc., and Newtown Refining Corporation. Robert Mahler was the owner of all of these companies while Diamond Head was still active. Superfund designation Diamond Head Oil Refinery became a Superfund site in 2002 after the state of New Jersey and the EPA decided that the site was too dangerous with chemicals. Both the state and the EPA performed their own investigative assessments on the site, researching the extent of the contamination along with the types of chemicals the site is contaminated with. State involvement The state of New Jersey issued a site assessment in May 2001 to investigate the extent of the damages and pollution at Diamond Head Oil Refinery. When they reported on the chemical exposure there, they said this: ‚ÄúAccording to the USEPA Expanded Site Inspection (December 1999), the environmental media at the site, including soils, sediments and groundwater, are contaminated. The contaminants include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semiVOCs and heavy metals, and are present at levels of potential health concern. Environmental/ecological threats to surface water were also suggested. However, no known drinking water intakes are located in any surface waters within 15 miles downstream of the site. In addition, commercial fishing is prohibited in nearby surface waters (USEPA, 1991). Recreational fishing does not occur in the region of the site.‚Äù EPA involvement The EPA performed several phases of Remedial Investigation to identify what was wrong with the site and to identify the extent of the contamination. These were performed between 2003 and 2009. In 2009, a Feasibility Study was performed to discuss different clean up options for the waste at the site. In 2016, another Feasibility Study was performed to address the contaminants in the soil. Health and environmental hazards The Diamond Head Oil Refinery has about three different kinds of dangerous chemicals polluting the area around it. All of these chemicals are dangerous for people to be exposed to since exposure to these chemicals can cause serious damage to people. The soil and surface waters around the site are heavily polluted by these chemicals. These chemicals polluting the site are what makes Diamond Head a Superfund site. Polychlorinated biphenyls One of the chemicals found at the site was PCB. PCB, or Polychlorinated biphenyls, are mixtures of colorless chemicals with no taste or smell. PCBs were originally produced to be used as insulation, coolants, and lubricants for a variety of electrical equipment. The production of PCBs was stopped in 1977 because it was suspected of certain harmful health and environmental effects. It is a dangerous chemical to humans and can cause damages to the liver if exposed to a large amount of it. Swallowing PCBs can result in coma or death. Volatile organic compounds Volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, are organic compounds that can easily become vapors or gases. These compounds are released from burning fuel and are also emitted from oil fields and diesel exhaust. Most compounds are hazardous air pollutants, so it is more common to be exposed by breathing in the air that is polluted. Some VOCs have no known health effects, while others can cause damage to the liver and nervous system. Clean up The EPA came up with a plan to clean the Diamond Head Oil Refinery. However, that plan has not taken its effect. The site still remains untouched and the estimated date of cleanup is unknown. Initial cleanup In 2009, the EPA proposed a plan to excavate and remove 2 feet of contaminated soil and cover the rest of the contaminated soil with clean fill. 49,00 cubic feet of contaminated soil will be removed from the site, and the removal will cost $14 million. Current status Currently, the Diamond Head Oil Refinery has not been effectively cleaned up. The plan that was proposed has yet to go into effect, and the site remains inactive. There is no more information on when the plan to clean the site will take place.

She was president of the Southern California Social Science Association, Town and Gown Club, Cornell Women's Club of Northern California, Stanford Woman's Club, and the University of California branch of the Equal Suffrage League, among others. She was the head of the History Department at the John H. Francis Polytechnic High School, chairman of the Department of Legislation Oakland Forum, and one of the earliest members of the Sierra Club. Early life Susan Bowen Jordan in 1879 Edith Monica Jordan was born on February 17, 1877, in Indianapolis, Indiana, the daughter of Dr. David Starr Jordan (1851-1931) and Susan Bowen (1845-1885). Her father was an ichthyologist and the first president of Stanford University. She grew up mostly in Indiana, spending her first two years of life in Indianapolis while her father served as professor of natural history at North Western Christian University (which later became Butler University). In 1879, she moved to Bloomington when her father was first appointed professor of zoology and later president of Indiana University. Her mother died when she was eight. At the age of 14, she left Indiana for California when her father was appointed president of Stanford University in 1891. At the age of 16, she enrolled at Stanford as a freshman and joined the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority in 1893. In 1896, she was elected second vice-president of her senior class at Stanford University and graduated in 1897 at the age of 20 with a degree in history. She then obtained a master's degree at Cornell University in 1901. She was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and of the alumni club of the Kappa Alpha Theta. In 1905, Edith Jordan accompanied her father during a months long stay in Europe, visiting leading universities to learn about their management. When her father had to return to California in September 1905, Edith Jordan remained in London, intending to travel to Italy and return in December 1905. In 1907, she acted as representative of Stanford University during official university events: that June, she presented the championship banner and the Stanford Cup to the Anaheim High School. Career Old, neoclassical campus of Polytechnic High near LA's historic core, 1905 Educator and education activist Gardner began her professional life as high school teacher of history and drew from personal experiences to make her lessons appealing. As an history teacher, she mixed archeology, art, architecture and travel to her lessons to make them more alive and interesting: Her pupils found her teaching so effective that they cited her words instead of those of textbooks during examinations. Early in her career, she taught at the Marlborough Preparatory School in Los Angeles and was a mathematics teacher at the Salinas High School. She then spent a year between 1908 and 1909 in London, England, to develop her history skills. From 1909 to 1915, Jordan was the head of the History Department at the Los Angeles Polytechnic High School, where she had taught for several years prior. She was one of the school's most prominent teachers and was also in charge of the visitors' day at the school. In the 1910s, Polytechnic was the first school to offer studies in multiple class subjects, which is now modeled by many high schools, as \\"periods\\".Text copied from John H. Francis Polytechnic High School, see that page for attribution As early as 1902, she was also interested in shaping the education system within the state of California. As a young school teacher at Salinas High School in 1902, she presented a paper, \\"The History Note Book\\", at a statewide meeting of the California Teachers Association condemning the use of the controversial \\"note-book system\\" in high schools as it pertained as an entrance requirement to Stanford University. Jordan claimed the notebook added interest to textbook work, but it was sometimes overestimated as a requirement for entrance to universities. In the 1910s, she was a member of the Executive Committee of the High School Teachers' Association and hosted its meetings at her own residence. In 1914, she was elected president of the Southern California Social Science Association. After she retired, she remained involved with the American Historical Association, like when, in 1917, she opened the College Teachers' session with the essay: \\"The relation between high-school history and freshman history.\\"  Other activism  In November 1913, she undertook a one-month trip in Egypt, following the Nile, with Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of the University of California, and his wife. She then continued alone to India, and then, with another teacher at Poly, Mary Putnam, they visited Montenegro, the then Federated Malay States, and Kuala Lumpur (where no American woman had been before them) and returned to the United States in February 1914. Once home, she gave a highly appreciated talk on the meaning of the flag to an American abroad during the George Washington's birthday celebrations. In November 1914, she was among the \\"prominent and active\\" women who hosted Lou Henry Hoover while she campaigned for work relief toward the Belgian population at the California Club; Jordan said of Hoover: \\"She is the most capable woman alive.\\" She was the chairman of the Department of Legislation Oakland Forum and a member of the Oakland Forum of the League of Women Voters. While she was a young teacher and high school department head living and working in Los Angeles in 1910, Jordan was also the president of the Berkeley-based University of California branch of the College Equal Suffrage League and addressed the subject of Women's suffrage in the United States at women's conventions. To attend suffrage meetings that were held regularly in Berkeley, she had to travel approximately 370 miles in each direction by steam-powered railroad from her home in Los Angeles. She was the president of the Town and Gown Club, which was founded in 1898 by Emmanuel Marie Paget. The clubwomen were active in the social life of the community and involved in environmental issues. In 1907, Jordan became involved in environmental preservation as one of the earliest members of the Sierra Club and by promoting natural walks to her students. Gardner was also a member of the Berkeley City Club, Oakland Club, Friday Morning Club, College Woman's Club of Los Angeles, on the board of directors of the Stanford Club of the Eastbay, and president of the Cornell Women's Club of Northern California and of the Stanford Woman's Club. In 1920, she was among the supporters of Herbert Hoover as a member of the Berkeley Hoover Republican Club. In 1928, she was included in the book Women of the West; a series of biographical sketches of living eminent women in the eleven western states of the United States of America, showcasing the few hundreds women that in the 1920s were prominent in frontier lands. She was a public vocational speaker on world affairs. In 1932, she addressed the East Bay Stanford Women's Club on the political situation in India. In 1940, she spoke in front of the Lake Arrowhead Women's Club on her traveling experience on Balkan countries, the then Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania. This talk covered tourist topics and social issues. Center of the Stanford campus in 1891. Her 1961 unpublished manuscript, \\"The days of Edith Jordan Gardner\\", is preserved at the Stanford University Archives and is used are reference material by other authors, like Harriet Kofalk for \\"No woman tenderfoot: Florence Merriam Bailey, pioneer naturalist\\". Being one of the last surviving persons who were present at Stanford University inauguration in 1891, in 1962 she was included in the essay \\"Stanford Mosaic\\", edited by Edith R. Mirrielees, collecting memoirs of people attending Stanford. The compilation began with Jordan's essay, \\"The University and I Were Young Together,\\" which included one of her memories of how, as the only telephone on campus was at their home, she used to bring messages they received to the various professors at the university offices on the Quad. Personal life Edith Jordan Gardner moved to Stanford, California, when her father was appointed president of Stanford University in 1891 and stayed with her parents until she had graduated from Stanford in 1897 and later moved to Los Angeles for a teaching position. In 1909, she was engaged to Edward Berwick, Jr., of Carmel. They met when both were students at Stanford. Both were well known in Los Angeles society. The engagement came as a surprise to their friends. Three weeks after the engagement was announced, Berwick was discovered dead of apparent natural causes in his parents' home in Pacific Grove, California, at the age of 34. Due to a winter storm that made roads impassable near Santa Barbara, both Edith Jordan and her father became stuck in transit and missed Berwick's funeral. She had a summer house at Carmel-by-the-sea. In 1915, she married Nathaniel Lyon Gardner (1864-1937), professor of Botany at the University of California in Berkeley, California, and curator of the university herbarium. As botanist, he identified the Pacific marine algae. They met when Gardner was head of the department of biology at the Los Angeles Polytechnic High School while Jordan was head of the history department. They lived at 2901 Hillegass Avenue, Berkeley. She died on June 16, 1965, in a convalescent home in Redwood City, California.

Laying on 12 acres of land, Bog Creek Farm is home to several hazardous and life-threatening contamination beginning in 1973 and continuing for a year. Over a decade later, actions began to take place to clean and restore the contaminated soil and water. Bog Creek Farm is situated near several other farms that house horses, growing crops and flowers, and livestock. Less than a mile down the road lies Allaire State Park, a park used by golfers, hunters, and fisherman. Origins Located in Howell Township, Bog Creek farm contains a pond, trench, and bog on a 12-acre lot of land on Monmouth County RT 547. It is best known as Squankum Road, in Howell Township, New Jersey. In the early 1970s, it started to become contaminated with a large amount of harmful chemicals, which would be later be evaporated into our atmosphere, potentially harming those breathing in the toxic air. Paint manufactures are to blame for the contamination of the area. Town history Howell Township, New Jersey is home to Bog Creek Farm. It was named after New Jersey's third governor, Richard Howell. This township was created in 1801, after Shrewsbury Township sectioned off a portion of their own land to create a new township. Outside of being known for Bog Creek Farm, Howell is most notable for being the set of the 2005 movie, War of the Worlds. As recently as June 2017, Howell Township made the news, when two isolated tornadoes struck the town- just minutes apart from each other- leaving several business, houses, and parks damaged. Company history Frederick Barry, Margaret M Barry, and Samuel Khaudary, the owners of the paint manufacturing company ‚ÄúWestern Ranch Corporation‚Äù, are the notable people ultimately to blame for the toxic dumping at Bog Creek farm. The parts of the property that were affected were the ground water, surface water, waste and soil. Elements dumped contained lacquer thinner, paint solvent, resins, animal carcasses, residual debris, VOC's and heavy metals. These contaminants were dumped in the disposal area between the years of 1973 to 1974. Superfund designation After seeing the health impact of those residing in the surrounding areas, State and Federal action was taken nearly a decade after the contamination began. A cleanup effort has taken effect that still remains to date. State intervention The state of New Jersey made the decision to take action in the mid-1980s, more than a decade after the damage began, although Bog Creek Farm was listed as a Superfund site in 1983. The property owners Frederick and Margaret Barry and Samuel Khaudary were directed to remove partial waste and cover the trench. Directions came shortly after on-site toxicity was brought to the attention of the Howell Township Health Department, located in Howell, New Jersey, by the property owners. It then became a national issue when EPA came up with a plan to clean the area with three major aquifers in September 1985. National intervention The control of contamination and its source was elected in September 1985 by EPA's Record of Decision. However, in 1984, EPA installed test pits, trenches, and wells on site to determine the extent of contamination. The site was addressed through the actions of Federal agents. EPA's involvement discovered the disposal area of 4 acres; about a third of the size of the 12-acre area. The site owners pumped the contaminated waste into landfills approved by the EPA. Health and environmental hazards Due to the high amount of contamination in the on-site groundwater, surface water, waste, sediment, and soil there are several health and environmental hazards. Infections, reactions, and disorders have been detected in pollution victims via contaminants detected in a laboratory. Groundwater, waste, and surface water contaminants included, but are not limited to benzene, chloroform, ethyl benzene, methylene chloride, dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, methyl phenol, trichloroethane, toluene, and xylenes. The on-site soil contained chlordane, chromium, lead, and PCB-1242. Sediment was contaminated with benzene, bis phthalate, heptachlor, toluene, and total xylenes. Environmental pathways began to migrate off-site via wind and water, effecting more than on-site life. Due to the unrestricted area the site lays on, hunting may be conducted on Bog Creek Farm. Contaminated food-chain entities that have been hunted have the potential to expose humans to the toxicity of the area. Water contamination Water carried though to Squankum Brook took a toll on the town's residents. In the short term, victims may suffer respiratory tract infection, visual disorders, skin reactions, nausea, and fatigue. However, in the long run, those victims may experience damage to liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. Land contamination Ground water, surface water, waste soil and sediment has the ability to cause harm to those who come in contact with the contaminated element. Such hazardous materials have the potential to be absorbed by the skin, inhaled, or ingested, leading to further health issues. Other contaminants Lacquer thinners, paint solvents, animal carcasses, residential debris, VOC's, heavy metals, resins, and disinfectants evaporated into the air, polluting the air inhaled by not only humans, but animals as well. This has had a huge impact on the 900 people, crops, agriculture and livestock residing within one mile of the Superfund site Bog Creek Farm. Cleanup 18,000 tons of contaminated soil was removed from the site to date. Removal and treatment of 6.5 million galled of contaminated groundwater have been conducted just in 2017. Human exposure is kept to a minimum with the best effort of the EPA. Initial cleanup Starting in 1985, cleanup was directed by EPA standards. The removal of wastewater from the bog and pond was the initial step. EPA continued on the restructuring and covering both the pond and bog. Using an on-site plant, clean water was discharged to nearby stream after the wastewater was treated. Several reviews were set up, such as a 5-year and 10-year review, to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the method of clean up. A security fence was placed around the work areas to ensure proper reliability of the controlled cleanup strategy. EPA conducted an investigation to reduce the amount and source of contamination at Bog Creek Farm. Current status Groundwater treatment in Bog Creek Farm is currently ongoing. Groundwater is extracted, treated, and re-injected using an on-site treatment method. This method is used to restore water resources in the Upper Kirkwood Aquifer. Contaminated sediments are also being cleaned up from the North Branch of Squankum Brook via manual digging up and incinerating. Operating continuously, the treatment system for the water at Bog Creek Farm treats nearly one million gallons of contaminated water, then re-injects the clean water, each month.

This study is practiced in multiple countries, each of whom has their own history of how anthropology has developed in their respective countries.  Latin America  Anthropology in Latin America is a well established discipline that has existed for over 100 years. The countries that are summarized in this section include Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, the Andean region, Costa Rica, and Colombia. For the moment, not included are discussions of anthropology (or ethnology) in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, or Haiti. Latin America anthropologists established their discipline in conjunction with American and European anthropologists, and revised their disciplines to study cultural phenomena through their own perspectives, independent of American and European thought. Latin America and the Caribbean  Andes  Andean anthropology's roots began during the turn of the 20th century, containing social movements between two groups in Peru, and from academia within the United States. The mestizo (non-native) and indigenous intellectuals known as indigenistas competed for political and intellectual space and recognition in Peru. Indigenous intellectuals advocated for interculturalidad, where indigenous thought could occupy Peruvian society as its own entity and not become blended as a singular national identity that the mestizaje proposed. The mestizaje perspective sought to modernize Peru and model their society similar to the United States. Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas was a writer and ethnographer in Peru, who classified himself as an indigenous intellectual that challenged Western thought and ideology. John Victor Murra, an anthropologist teaching in the United States collaborated with Arguedas. Their collaboration stemmed from Murra's travels in 1952 to the Latin American region when he was working under the anthropologist Sidney Mintz as a PhD student. Indigenistas were active in social and political movements in Latin America and collaborated with people inside of the United States, but still sought to be independent from Western thought. AAA In 1936, the American Anthropological Association initiated studies in Latin America on how to incorporate indigenous people in Latin American society, termed acculturation studies, and in 1935, the Social Science Research Council, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Committee on Latin American studies worked to benefit the interests of the United States. The Peruvian government funded anthropological institutions beginning in the 1940s, and the establishment of the Instiuto de Etnologia y Arqueologia and a Peruvian sector in the Instituto Indigneista Interamericano followed. By the 1960s Peruvian governmental funding decreased, and became reliant upon the United States for funding. The indigenous incorporation into the goal of a singular society was termed cholification by the Peruvian sociologist Anibal Quijano. In the 1990s during the Neo-liberal era, indigenous thought became more recognized with political conflicts in the Andean region, and interculturalidad was pursued again for Andean states to recognize the diversity of the people that occupied them.  Argentina  Social Anthropology was established in Argentina in 1957. It was first institutionalized at the University of Buenos Aires. Before the institutionalization of social anthropology, the discipline largely focused on historical studies. Rosana Guber attributes the introduction of social anthropology to Esther Hermitte who was a history professor at the Ethnographic Museum in Argentina. It was during her trips to the University of Chicago that she was introduced to social anthropology, and so it was the west who influenced the institutionalization of social anthropology in Argentina. In 1965, students began to ask for a discipline separate from sociology, and that was not focused primarily on indigenous people. There was a movement around this time that called for a greater understanding of the changes modern society was going through, especially during and after the 1966 Revoluci√≥n Argentina. Later, in 1974, students and faculty within departments that were studying social movements and change suffered kidnappings and murders by the Argentine AntiCommunist Alliance. The current status of Argentinian anthropology is still deeply rooted in western influence.  Brazil  234x234px Anthropology in Brazil was institutionalized in 1930 at the beginning of the Vargas Era. Later during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil was experiencing political authoritarianism. As a result, anthropology began to address inter-ethnic friction. In the 1970s anthropologists began to consider nearby urban studies as a topic of research. The 1980s kicked off a more modern type of anthropology where anthropologists began to look at themselves as ‚Äúthe other‚Äù. Brazil did not have an issue of alterity or exoticism, because it existed within its own borders. Brazil began to value exoticism and viewed it as the acknowledgement of cultural diversity according to Mariza Peirano. In general, the overall current goal for Brazilian anthropology was to better the future for modernization by enlightening modern political elite and identifying relevant topics for investigation. Some of Brazil's main anthropological institutions are the University of Brazil, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and the Brazilian Association of Anthropology.  Colombia  Anthropology in Colombia was institutionalized during the mid-1940s. Between the 1950s-70's, Colombian anthropologists sought to integrate into national society and began to deal with terms like culture, integration, and assimilation. However, during the 1970s, this early understanding of anthropology was opposed and anthropologists began to confront terms such as national integration because they felt it was loaded with other issues like racial supremacy. Emerging social movements encouraged this new way of thinking because it recognized the rights of peasant and ethnic populations as well as the influence of Marxism. Anthropologists continued this way of thinking through the 1980s although a larger influence from militant anthropology became apparent. By militant anthropology, Myriam Jimeno refers to anthropologists who often debate and participate, but write very little. The goal of this type of anthropology was to alter the symbols of national identity and to accompany new ethnic movements in finding representation. Anthropologists and ethnic groups aimed to challenge the way indigenous groups were being ostracized by cultural hegemony. Later on in 1991, Colombia underwent a process of constitutional reform and development in attempt to recognize more cultural and ethnic rights. Some of its current most influential institutions are the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History, the Colombian National University, and the National Institute of Ethnology.  Costa Rica  Presidenta del Partido Acci√≥n Ciudadana Margarita Bola√±os Arqu√≠n Costa Rican anthropology was institutionalized in 1967 under political influence. According to Margarita Bola√±os Arqu√≠n, increasing notions of nationalism and anti imperialism led to the institutionalization of social sciences in Costa Rica. During the 1960s, around the time of institutionalization, social scientists' primary focus was on the birth and implications of social movements, as well as the consequences of modernization in rural areas. Later, French Structural Marxism influenced the social sciences to take an interest in the study of class structures. Over time, anthropology in Costa Rica was highly criticized in its struggle to find its identity. Caught in a sort of balancing act between western and Latin American practice, anthropology in Costa Rica eventually learned to take the criticisms of other anthropologies and made a name for itself with a focus on gender studies, identity studies, and developmental problems. To legitimize their discipline, anthropology contributed to other sciences such as linguistics, agriculture, and psychology. However, during the 1980s Costa Rica endured a recession, and anthropological institutions were under threat. During this time, globalization was becoming increasingly popular and while during the recession of the 1980s Costa Rica was not seen as a power player, at the start of the 1990s, the country could now participate in ways that were productive. It was not until around the 1990s that anthropologists regained the opportunity to research and, after such political and economic turmoil, there was much to question. Throughout the 1990s the focus of anthropology and other disciplines such as sociology continued to research in rural areas but shifted their research to the survival of the poor during tough economic times.  Mexico  Manuel Gamio, the first Mexican anthropologist, earned his PhD in 1921, having studied under Franz Boas. The first anthropology department was established in 1938. Indigenous population studies known as indigenism, are an integral part of Mexican anthropology, and became popular during the presidency of L√°zaro Cardenas, serving from 1934‚Äì1940. The National Institute of Anthropology and History was established by President L√°zaro C√°rdenas in 1939, and remains a prominent place of anthropological study in Latin America. The nation-building interests of incorporating the indigenous population into the Mexican state also led to the establishment of the Inter- American Indian Institute in 1942, in Mexico City, along with the establishment of the academic journal, America Ind√≠gena. Marxist theory was predominantly used to analyze social phenomena, and was combined with social evolution theory that viewed Mexico in three historical time phases: pre- Hispanic, Colonial, and Modern. thumbPresident Lazaro Cardenas In office 1934-1940 In the 1970s, Gonzalo Aguirre Beltr√°n, an anthropologist who was formerly a medical doctor worked for the federal government and promoted critical anthropology in Mexico that used Marxist theory and rejected imperialistic practices from the United States. Mexico's urban populations began to increase in the 1970s, which became another topic of study for anthropologists. In the 1980s, Gramscian Marxism became the theoretical center, and studies included rural and urban populations, and labor. Institutions of anthropology have continued to increase since the 1980s, offering undergraduate and graduate degrees. Neo-liberal market transformations in the 1990s have affected anthropological training presently, as students may find careers not only in the universities, but non- governmental organizations.  Asia  Asia includes the countries China, Japan, Philippines, and Siberia. Anthropology in Asia has been influenced by Western anthropological ideologies through colonial contact, historically. While the discipline of anthropology is historically built from nation- building and colonization from core countries, language and publishing barriers, funding opportunities and political status all influence the structure of anthropological research in each Asian country. Anthropology in the social and cultural perspective have not always had a strong tradition in Asian anthropology, but ethnography, ethnology, and folklore often have dominant roots within the discipline.  China  Cai Yuanpei, the father of anthropology in China Chinese anthropology was founded by scholar Cai Yuanpei. Cai Yuanpei was a scholar educated at the University of Leipzig, and he brought both Western influence and standardization into the discipline of anthropology in China. The first department of anthropology was founded in 1928 with Cai Yuanpei's creation of Academia Sinica in Beijing. At Academia Sinica, physical anthropology and archaeology held focus. Franz Boas also brought Western influence to China, and British functionalism would make a lasting impact on Chinese anthropology. In addition to Cai Yuanpei, Wu Wenzao was one of the most influential proponents of Western-influenced anthropology, and he took classes under Ruth Benedict (one of Boas‚Äô students that would be influential in the field of anthropology on her own overall). Wu began teaching at Yenjing University in 1929, where he would influence students such as Fei Xiaotong and Lin Yaohua, who would go on to be important in the scene of Chinese anthropology. Chinese Ethnological Association created in 1934, but its progress was halted by China's involvement in World War II in 1937. World War II pushed back the institutional development of anthropology in China until the late 1940s. With this revitalization, Chinese anthropologists began to look inwards at themselves for subjects of study. This inward focus led anthropologists of the time to attempt to use anthropology to better Chinese society. 1940-late 1950s was a time of Soviet influence in China, followed by 1957-1977 and Mao Zedong‚Äôs era of the People's Republic of China. During this time, Maoist aims supplemented ethnology and Chinese national identity creation. Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) building Post-1978 was a time of reform in China following the end of Mao Zedong's leadership. Academia was reconstructed, and anthropology subsequently saw a revival during this time. Exchanges between foreign faculty and students helped to globalize Chinese anthropology and bring in other perspectives. Liang Zhaotong was an advocate for the revival of social and cultural anthropology, but for this to happen, anthropology had to be seen as a useful tool for improvements in the field of the social sciences and society. Anthropology was held in lower regard than ethnology in China due to the ideology of Mao Zedong, and anthropologists left anthropology for other disciplines in social science, such as sociology, which subsequently saw a large period of development in the 1980s. This lower regard for anthropology also caused the field to receive less attention and less funding from the public and Chinese institutions. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the State Education Committee founded the Chinese Anthropological Association in 1981 (now part of the East Asian Anthropological Association). Today, anthropology in China is still influenced by its history of being less practical and less important in the field of social sciences. This causes a lack of public interest and awareness in Chinese anthropology in favor of more ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù disciplines, such as medicine, business, law, etc.  Japan  Torii Ryuzo 1952 The creation of anthropology in Japan was a response to the research of Edward Morse, the first professor of Zoology at Tokyo Imperial University, where he discovered signs of cannibalism in Japan. Japanese nationalism motivated Japanese peoples to study themselves rather than being subjects of study by outsiders. This motivation led to the formation of Anthropological Society of Tokyo in 1886. Tsuboi Sh√¥gor√¥ was a leading member of this group, and he is named one of the founding fathers of Japanese anthropology. In 1892, he became the first professor of anthropology at Tokyo Imperial University. In 1895, the Japanese colonial empire was marked by the annexation of Taiwan and led to an increase in domestic ethnographers in this region. Torii Ry≈´z≈ç was Tsuboi's successor and greatly attributed data and photographs of Taiwan during this time period. His own research abroad redirected peoples' focus from themselves, Japanese folklore-studies, to the colonial Others. The expansion Japanese imperialism drove Ry≈´z≈ç's research of others. This shift in research subjects created a separate discipline, ethnology or 'race studies.' In 1934, Japanese Society of Ethnology (Nihon Minzokugakkai) was formed, which separated Japanese folklore and ethnological studies from comparative ethnology. In 1968, the Eighth Congress of the International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (IUAES) was held in Japan. In 2004, in response to the IUAES, the Japanese Society of Ethnology changed its name to the Japanese Society of Cultural Anthropology; this is one of the largest organizations at 2,000 members. Considered to be a semi-peripheral country in comparison to the West, Japan is home to the largest number of anthropologists in Asia as well as the largest center for anthropological research in Asia. Japan's history resembles a colonial power in East Asia. Currently, language and audience discrepancies hinder open conversations between Japanese and American anthropologies. Since Western academic anthropologists publish in English, their local and global audience is essentially one. In Japan, writing for a global audience requires publishing in English. While Japanese scholars are knowledgeable about Western anthropological theories and trends, institutional factors deter Japanese anthropologists to publish in English; a more extensive peer review process can delay publication approval for years resulting in outdated empirical data. Japanese academics prefer to publish in university in-house journals where there is a much shorter delay in publication approval. A local audience means publishing in Japanese and increasing the gap between world anthropologies.  Philippines  The movement of indigenization of anthropology in the Philippines challenges foreign-adopted Western concepts, theories and methods. To understand the viewpoints of this process, indigenization can be examined as a historical process, a perspective of native concepts, and as both a problem and solution created by colonial or neocolonial educational curriculum.Yamashita, Shinji, et al. ‚ÄúTowards Indigenization: Responses, Challenges, and Experiences in the Philippines.‚Äù The Making of Anthropology in East and Southeast Asia, Berghahn Books, 2004, pp. 335‚Äì353. From 1560‚Äì1898, the Philippines was under Spanish colonial regime. During this time, Spanish colonizers established society through theologoical orthodoxy. They valued their own written history over the Philippines' native traditions, and oral tradition was undermined by colonization. From 1898‚Äì1941, the second period of colonization by the United States took place. Ethnographic knowledge was established as the basis of integration of indigenous elements into mainstream Philippine society. In 1914, anthropology curriculum was established at the University of the Philippines, and three years later, an anthropology department was created. In 1921, the anthropology department at the University of Philippines merged with the sociology department. During the post-war era (1946-1968), student activism, national pride and identity reinforced the process of decolonization; the University of the Philippines was at the forefront of this movement. Filipino scholars increasingly pursued graduate programs in the United States anthropology departments. This created an issue that will be discussed further. From 1970‚Äì1986, social and political consciousness in the Philippines marked a revolutionary period. The country adopted conflict models; Marxist ideology was more suitable for the Philippines that was in a crisis state. In the late 1970s, the Philippine Folklore Society was formed. This growth of folklore studies was due to the further development of indigenization in the Philippines. In 1977, The Philippine Anthropological Society (Ugnayan ng Agham Tao or UGAT) was founded. After 1986, this period was marked by a heightened cultural consciousness. President Corazon Aquino promoted culture through creation of the National Commission for Culture and Arts (NCCA). The distance between native and foreign anthropologists is a conflict in the Philippines. While most scholars receive formal education in Western societies, they often return \\"home\\" and view their native society through a foreign, Westernized lens they were conditioned and educated by. Native anthropologists are hindered by a perspective based on bias. Interests, training, values, and field exposure can result in differences between foreign and native anthropologists. It is important to recognize these different angles, politics of representation, and ethnographic authority in order to successful observe others as well as our own societies. Another challenge in anthropology in the Philippines is discussed by Filipino anthropologist, Carlos Jr. P Tatel, about funding for research on governmental and regional levels. He explains that anthropology proposals for funding often deviate from original plan in order to fit the agendas of agencies who grant travel and research funding.  Siberia  Siberia as a territory was important in the development of Russian anthropology due to its position of alterity within Russia. Siberia and the people of Northern Russia were points of great interest throughout various periods in Russian history as it tried to better understand its own people. Vladimir Bogoraz, one of the founding fathers of Siberian studies in Russia The beginnings of ethnographic research in Siberia were heavily influenced by anthropology in Germany and ideas of Russian nationalism in the 19th century. The expedition led by Franz Boas, the Jesup North Pacific Expedition from 1897‚Äì1902, helped to bring international attention to the concept of doing anthropology in Siberia in relation to Russian anthropology in addition to bringing Boas‚Äô anthropological perspective into Russia. Also on this expedition were Vladimir Bogoraz, Vladimir Jochelson, and Leo Sternberg, who would be known as the founding fathers of Siberian studies, and influential ethnographers in Russia. The nationalistic undercurrent in Russia at the time of the beginnings of researching Siberia as a place of intrigue was reflected in the Russians' attitude towards the people in Siberia. The impetus to study Siberians was rooted in the idea that one day the people in the area would all assimilate to Russian culture, and due to this, the current culture of the people should be documented and recorded. Russian ideologies heavily influenced the research field in Siberia, and studying Russian and Siberian history was an easier route for research due to the uncertainty of what would be acceptable to study under the Russian government in the 19th and 20th centuries. Under Soviet Russia in the early 20th century, ethnology moved toward a more lstructural and functionalist view, with the goal of generally understanding human culture. When Joseph Stalin came into power, this view shifted as Stalin aimed to homogenize Russian culture and identity. Ethnologists were employed by the state with a focus on understanding, regulating, and standardizing the different ethnic groups of Russia.  Central and Eastern Europe  Map of Central and Eastern Europe Central and Eastern Europe includes the countries of Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, and Hungary among many others. Anthropological study is active in many places Europe through research centers, academic societies, and universities on a range of topics. One of the biggest problems facing anthropologists in Central and Eastern Europe is the need to define themselves as a discipline separate from any other.  Central Europe  Anthropology in central European countries has its roots in Germany. The establishment of anthropology within central Europe has been a slow process that involved first understanding what the discipline was and then determining how it fit within each country's individual ideals.  Austria  thumb216x216pxPater Wilhelm Schmidt February 16, 1868 - February 10, 1954 Austrian anthropology has close ties to Germany and is generally intertwined with German-speaking countries. As such, the history of anthropology in Austria is foggy until the marked institutionalization of the discipline. The Anthropological Society in Vienna (ASV) was the first anthropological institution in Austria. It was established on February 13, 1870 and is a non-profit organization. The ‚Äúnew anthropology‚Äù approach was the ASV's foundation and Bernd Weiler's term for anthropology that existed post- publication of Charles Darwin‚Äôs On the Origin of Species. Anthropology within academia was postponed until 1919 when the Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography was created at the University of Vienna. The institute was divided into two later, making the Anthropological Institute and Institute for Ethnology. In 2005, the Anthropological Institute became the Department of Anthropology and is the only anthropology department that exists within the country. A notable anthropologist is Richard Thurnwald who was an Austrian- born German anthropologist and sociologist. He was multilingual in Arabic, Turkish, Serbian, and Russian and a professor at universities in the United States and Germany during the early 1900s Thurnwald was also the editor of various journals, including the one he originated, called Journal of Popular Psychology and Sociology, which was later renamed Sociologus. His wife continued publishing the journal despite his death in 1954. His work included the study of kinship, social structure, superstratification, feudalism, kingship, cities, and states, and western colonial expansion. Weltmuseum Wien \\"World Museum Vienna\\" Another important figure was Pater Wilhelm Schmidt who was a German-born ordained Roman Catholic priest, anthropologist, and linguist. Anthropos is a journal he created in 1906 and the Anthropos Institute is an institution he founded in 1931. He relocated both to Switzerland in 1938 due to his distaste for Hitler's ideals. He was a professor at the Universities of Vienna and Freiburg, had published extensively, and his research topics included family, religion, language, and culture. Karl Franzens University of Graz‚Äôs humanities department includes the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and European Ethnology which offers bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees in Anthropology. The key topics of research the institution is involved in include ‚Äúcity, governmentality, limit and difference, mobilities, visual culture, material culture, museum, religiousness, and science research as well as subject-oriented methodologies.‚Äù Weltmuseum Wien is an ethnographic museum located in Vienna that serves to display cultural diversity. Weltmuseum Wien, translated ‚ÄòWorld Museum Vienna‚Äô, opened in 1928 and houses worldwide artifacts, not including Europe, from as early as the 1500s. The museum's previous title was the Museum of Ethnology and it recently reopened after closing for renovations in 2014.  Croatia  University of Zagreb est. 1669 Croatian anthropology started with a focus more on natural and medical topics because it wasn't embraced as a human-centered scientific discipline. In 1973, various European anthropologists met for the first time to discuss the making of a European Association for Anthropology. It wasn't until the fourth meeting in Zagreb, on October 7, 1976, that the board members established the European Anthropological Association. The initial meeting triggered a chain reaction development of anthropology within Croatia because, meanwhile, in 1974, the Croatian Physicians Assembly established the section for biological anthropology. Soon after, the Croatian Anthropological Society was created in 1977 along with its journal, titled Collegium Antropologicum. Finally, in 1992, the Institute for Anthropological Research was established at the University of Zagreb.  Slovenia  Anthropology in Slovenia has been greatly influenced by surrounding nations due to the country's small size. There was a shift in language after World War II that caused German language to be controversial so English began being taught to children which later resulted in students being more interested in an ethnographic college curriculum. The University of Ljubljana started offering anthropology courses in 1933 which were taught by Bo≈æo ≈†kerlj as the first college professor to teach the subject in Slovenia. Later, he created a chair in anthropology at the University of Ljubljana in 1946 that was eventually placed within the biology department; but, within a few years of his death in 1961, the subject became questioned which resulted in its being terminated. However, social anthropology was already part of the sociology curriculum which was established earlier in the 1960s. It wasn't until the 1990s that this branch of anthropology became an official program offered to graduate students. thumb178x178pxNiko ≈Ωupaniƒá December 1, 1876 - September 11, 1961 Bo≈æo ≈†kerlj was an Austrian-born anthropologist who studied physical anthropology in Prague. He was initially interested in German physical anthropology but, at the time of World War II, decided to focus on cultural anthropology instead. His work reflected a combination of the two topics. Another important figure in Slovene anthropology is Niko ≈Ωupaniƒá who was born in 1876. He was the creator of the Slovene Ethnographic Museum, which opened in 1923, and the museum's corresponding journal, Etnolog, that began in 1926. His educational background was in physical anthropology, archaeology, and history and, in 1940, he became a professor for the ethnology and ethnography department at the University of Ljubljana. Niko ≈Ωupaniƒá died on September 11, 1961. The Slovene Anthropological Society has been active since its founding in 1992 and arranges an international science conference every three years called ≈†kerlj's days. The society's journal is named Anthropological Notebooks. The articles inside are preferred to be unique to the journal and they're published in English language.  Switzerland  thumb171x171pxJ. J. Bachofen December 22, 1815 -November 25, 1887 The discipline of anthropology in Switzerland, like Austria, is closely tied to Germany and German-speaking countries in general. Swiss anthropology originated with studying folklore, also known as volkskunde, and ethnology, or v√∂lkerkunde. Between 1912 and 1916, ethnographic museums held seminars in ethnology and folklore and were the beginning of anthropology being taught in Switzerland. Johann Jakob Bachofen, born in 1815, was a professor at the University of Basel, criminal court judge, member of city legislative council, and an anthropological writer. He came from a wealthy family and was well educated in law, Philology, history and ancient history. A popular, influential publication of his, titled Das Mutterrecht, explored past societies with the idea that matriarchy came before patriarchy. Initially it was rejected but was later printed in 1861. Bachofen published many works but none were accepted until well after his death in 1887.  Eastern Europe  Anthropology in Eastern Europe varies in is roots, but many of the different anthropologies share a common interest in folklore and human populations. Eastern European anthropologists, official and non official, tend to focus on studying local issues and staying out of international affairs. The anthropological trend in Eastern Europe is a turn toward the social sciences and anthropology after separation from the Soviet Union.  Belarus  The first Belarus postgraduate training program with anthropology was in February 1965 and was at the Institute of Art, Ethnography and Folklore of the Academy of Sciences of the BSSR. Kazakh woman on a horse After separating from the Soviet Union, Belarus went through a period of state development that lasted from about 1990 to 1994. During this time, the focus was on nation- building. This required both an institutional and ideological change from the time when Belarus was under Soviet rule. A policy of ‚ÄúBelarusisation‚Äù was implemented in order to bring back culture and language that was understood to be native to Belarus. In 1971, anthropological research focused on the characteristics of populations within Belarus, looking at perceived internal ‚Äúothers‚Äù. In the 1980s, anthropologists were looking at the genetic structure of human populations based on demographics and environment, along with a study of Belarus's child population. Belarusian anthropologists also looked outside of Belarus through the Research Institute and Museum of Anthropology from Moscow State University in order to study the Chukchi, Eskimos, Kazakhs, and Khakas peoples. One important figure in Belarusian anthropology was L.I. Tegako, who is cited as being one of its founders in the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. She began research on ethnic health issues in the 1960s, which is one of the first instances of an official sort of anthropology in Belarus. Her teacher was V.P. Alekseev of Russia. From her research, she concluded that ‚ÄúBelarusians manage to stay within variations which are typical for Caucasian race.‚Äù Tegako took part in much of the work in the 1980s on both the genetic structure of human populations and the child studies. She also led twenty expeditions outside of Belarus. Lidiya Ivanovana is also an important character in Belarusian anthropology. She obtained her PhD in Russia in 1990 with a dissertation that looked at populations in Belarus. Her work was the first to take a multi-dimensional approach involving different types of materials from several different populations within Belarus. Ivanovana is attributed as having contributed many of the anthropological methods used in Belarus.  Bulgaria  New Bulgarian University Anthropology appeared in an official status in Bulgaria in late 1989 due to the fall of the communist regime and is thought to be a product of democratization of society. The first departments to include something like anthropology were departments of ethnology, which were concerned with ethnography and folklore, and were worked in to the departments of philology or history. Anthropology itself was introduced at New Bulgarian University (NBU) as a priority, but they had to combine with a discipline recognized by the state, which like in many other cases, was the department of sociology with the degree being a sociology one. It wasn't until around 2004 that anthropology got its own department with its own degree in Bulgaria. One of Bulgarian anthropology's main focuses at first was to carve out their own niche as a discipline, especially considering that Bulgarian anthropologists come from a variety of backgrounds. They were also left with ideas from the socialist period and the fall of communism. There was also focus on the changing social conditions from the period of transition after the fall of communism. There was push for democratization in Bulgaria, and anthropology became something of a symbol for that change. Despite this, there was still polarization on methods and ideology within the new discipline based on debates about Soviet versus Western styles of education, which were understood to be ideological opposites. The shift was eventually toward Western ideas. Bulgarian anthropologists tend to focus on research within their own borders, but also research in Balkans. Despite the branching out of Bulgaria, there are a limited number of field-research sites, a limited number of subjects, and a limited number of methods taken advantage of by Bulgarian anthropologists. Much attention is paid to community formation, complex societies, power, polity, statehood, nationalism, myth, ritual, religion, marriage, kinship, ethnicity, nation-hood, magic, medicine, and multiculturality.  Czech Republic  Location of Czech Republic on the map The Czech Republic takes a constructivist approach to anthropology (closely connected to ethnology), which they take a positivist approach to. Ethnology is taken to be trying to get at objective truth, where anthropology is getting at social constructs and beliefs. Despite this split between ideas of ethnology and anthropology in the Czech Republic, anthropology is not yet a fully established discipline. After the split from communism in 1989, there was a turn to socio-cultural anthropology in the way of ideology, but it was inconsistent. Some academics saw it as the same thing as ethnology, while others thought of it as a different research field with different methods and traditions, which resulted in the difficulty of establishing anthropology as a discipline. Many argue for there being a real epistemological difference between the two approaches.  Hungary  Hungarian anthropology is a defined discipline with its own departments and methods, though there is still overlap between anthropology and other related departments, like history and sociology. Hungarian anthropology places a premium on verifying sociological and anthropological results with scientific data. Gyula Ortutay 14 March 1947 ‚Äì 25 February 1950 In 1963, the Ethnographic Research Group, which was attached to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences was founded. It was led by Gyula Ortutay and had twenty-two participating members. The research focused on Hungarian folklore, but the group also looked at peasant economy, social institutions, and Siberian tribal society. If a senior member had an interest outside of Hungary, then that was also a permissible research topic. Cultural Anthropological departments were established at the University of Budapest in 1990 and the University of Miskolc in 1993. There are many places to publish anthropological works within Hungary. The majority of the work is published in languages other than Hungarian and appear mostly in European periodicals. Many of the works do not appear in American anthropological journals due to a gap in how things are understood between the two anthropological fields. Many Hungarian anthropologists believe that the methods and problems that they need to consider are within their own borders or within their own region. They tend to stay out of international problems and direct their funding toward internal concerns. Bela C. Maday points out that communication is not a strong suit for Hungarian anthropologists, which makes communicating ideas with core anthropologists, like those from the U.S. or Western Europe, difficult, but there has been much dispute on this point.  Russia  Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg The beginnings of anthropology in Russia can be traced back to the establishment of the Russian Academy of Sciences under Peter the Great in 1725. Following the Academy of Sciences, many museums were also created with the impetus for studying culture, including the Ethnographic Bureau of the Russian Geographical Society in the mid-19th century. The 1840s also saw the creation of physical anthropology and archaeology as sub- disciplines of anthropology. In 1864 the first university department for anthropology in Russia was created at Moscow University. The first specialized journal for Russian anthropology, (trans.) The Ethnographic Review (Etnograficheskoe obozrenie), was created in 1889. As Russia did not have state-supplemented funding in the 19th century, much of the financial support came from aristocrats such as Count Aleksey Uvarov and Prince V. N. Tenishev. Kunstkamera (Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography) in Saint Petersberg In the early 20th century, St. Petersburg and Moscow would be centers for the development of anthropology‚Äîfocused on ethnology and ethnography‚Äîwith the formation of the Department of Ethnology in Leningrad (1928), Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (1924), the publication of the journal Ethnography (1926), the Anuchin Institute of Anthropology at the University of Moscow (1922), etc. Anthropology in Russia was also influenced by Western anthropological perspectives, such as Franz Boas. Following the Communist Party takeover, Russia began to favor ethnology over anthropology. Ethnology was the study of different ethnic groups within the state, which supported the push for homogenization and national unification of the Russian state. Marxist theory replaced Western anthropological theory, and various university departments were closed as Russia experienced an ideological reconstruction. In the mid-20th century, with undercurrents of the Cold War, social and cultural anthropology were rejected from ethnographic study, but ethnography was re-institutionalized and strengthened in universities and institutions across Russia. In the latter half of the 20th century, Russian ethnography to other parts of the world in which Soviet influence was strong, such as Eastern Europe. The Perestroika in 1985 led to another bout of reconstruction for anthropology, and Russian science in general. Institutes were renamed and reconfigured to match this new trend. Social anthropology also began to make a comeback, leading to identity problems for social anthropology as a discipline in a country with such a strong ethnographic tradition that had excluded it for years. The 1990s, a time of great social and political change for Russia with the end of the USSR, were a time for critical introspective views on the recent past. With this, Russian anthropology turned towards more contemporary interests, where it still is today. Even with these contemporary interests, Russian anthropology still finds itself heavily influenced by the ethnology of its past and attempting to reconcile what it means to be a ‚Äúsocial‚Äù anthropologist in this environment.  Anthropology of the Arab World  The discipline of anthropology is not new to the Arab world. While there were no established anthropological institutions until the 20th century, scholars such as Abu Rayhan al-Biruni and Ibn Khaldun, are recognized for their contribution to the discipline as early as the 10th century. Egypt, Palestine, and the Persian Gulf region have received most of the scholarly attention, with a particular focus on nationalism and the state. The Arab youth are a growing area of interest for anthropologists in the Arab world. Comparatively little research is done in Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, the Sudan, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq. This is in part a result of accessibility and the conditions of the states. That status of anthropology in the Arab world would be labeled as peripheral in relation to anthropology in other regions of the world.  Middle East   Iran  The man known as the father of Iranian Anthropology was named Sadegh Hedayat (1903-1951). His focus was on folklore. In 1937, an institute of ethnology was founded in Iran, which then closed in 1941. It then reopened with the rise to power of Mohammed Reza Shah. From 1956 to 1959, it published a journal titled \\"Majalle-ye Mardomshenasi\\" (Journal of Anthropology). In 1957, the first anthropological elective course offered at a college level in Iran began at the University of Tehran. In the past, there was not as much of an emphasis placed on receiving degrees from foreign universities. Similarly, international research was also not highly valued. International study and research, however, has begun gaining more and more importance within the departments of anthropology in Iran. Anthropology in Iran suffers from a poor reputation in the public sphere. It is considered to be a weak discipline, according to Iranian anthropologist, Soheila Shahshahani. Perhaps because of this, most students of the social sciences tend to choose other disciplines, such as law, management, and psychology. As society changes, more attention is being paid to the field. Today, ethnographic research in the area focused on internal subjects, such as the pastoralists living in the arid areas around Iran. These studies continue today, but other fields of interest have started to emerge. A new focus on small town life and rural areas has recently developed. Professor Shahshanani states that the weakness of current anthology in Iran is the lack of theoretical work done by its practitioners. She also goes on to say that these issues could be solved by getting Iranian anthropologists who have trained elsewhere to come back and practice in Iran.  Levant   Lebanon  The department of sociology at the American University of Beirut was the first to offer an anthropology course, which is listed in its 1950-51 catalogue. The department of anthropology was officially founded in the 1970s, and saw 33 students graduate with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology throughout that decade. The Lebanese Civil War, which lasted from 1975‚Äì1990, interfered with the development of the department and anthropology at the university saw a decline as a direct result. During this time, the new department of social and behavioral sciences (SBS) which already encompassed sociology, psychology, and communication, absorbed the anthropology department. During the 1980s, records show just one student having graduated with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology, while there were none in the 1990s. There were three anthropologists on the faculty throughout this time. Among them were Fuad Khuri, Martha Mundy, and Gerald Obermeyer. A survey conducted in 1989 by Seteney Shami, a 1976 graduate of the BA program in anthropology at the American University in Beirut, sought to learn more about the teachings of anthropology at universities in the Arab world. Her findings suggested that the role of the discipline in the Arab world were minimal. In an academic report that came out in 2006, anthropologists at the same university claim to have found little evidence in the local community of any significant changes since. Today's anthropology graduates in Lebanon have opportunities to work with local NGOs. However, for those interested in pursuing anthropology as a discipline, the West still stands as the one destination for that. Anthropology departments at the American University in Beirut, and in Lebanon, are stifled by war. As a destination for anthropologists to do research, Lebanon is among the top spots for emerging scholars in the Arab world.  Palestine  Palestine has seen an increase in research conducted in the territory and among the Palestinian communities in Israel, as well as refugee camps in neighboring countries. The history of Palestinian anthropology can be marked by four modes of ethnographic engagement: Biblical Palestine, Oriental Palestine, Absent Palestine, and Post-Structural Palestine. Biblical Palestine refers to the main method of ethnographic engagement of Palestine which took place in the first decades of the 20th century. Led predominately by Europeans, their interest was motivated by the use of the Bible as a legitimizing text to influence the region. Early work consisted of European writers fetishizing and romanticizing the land and the people based on the Biblical figures. Oriental Palestine, a term coined by a Palestinian scholar (find scholar, cite) was the leading mode of engagement throughout the first four decades of the 20th century. It was marked by a sense of urgency to document Palestine as a source of Europe's beginnings. Through this lens, a narrative was offered that challenged the colonial British vision of Palestinian history which saw the Arabs there as \\"transient and ephemeral\\". It was also marked by a sense of duty among others to capture the traditional fabric of Palestine before its dissolution, which appeared evident at the time due to the events surrounding the rise of Zionism. Absent Palestine follows immediately after the demise of Palestine in 1948, and can only be fully understood in terms of the success of Zionism. In this sense, the state of Palestine was eclipsed by the narrative of Israel as a place offering a safe haven to endangered refugees from Europe. This ethnographic silence of Palestinians is seen as the turning point in Israel's image of modernity. Post-Structural Palestine is the current main method of ethnographic engagement. It is known primarily for its stance that challenges and brings to question Israel's efforts to repress Palestinian nationalism. The movement has seen a rising trend in which the Palestinian subject is explored for their national identity, rather than silenced.  Turkey  Anthropology as a discipline in Turkey can trace its roots back to 1925. Developing in an nationalistic atmosphere, The Anthropology Institute, otherwise known as The Center for Anthropological Research in Turkey, was established on that year within the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Istanbul. From 1925 to the 1960s, the main topics of research centered around studies of rural and village life, with a focus on nation building. In the 1960s, a series of military coups occurred, causing considerable changes to the field and to academia itself. It was not until the year 1997 that the first official department of anthropology was established in Turkey, at the private Yeditepe University in Istanbul. As of 2010, 6 of the 53 state universities in Turkey offered training in anthropology. In contrast to this, only one of the 24 private universities offer similar training. The first anthropological association in Turkey was founded in 1992.  Persian Gulf   Saudi Arabia  Many Anthropologists investigate the tribal system in Saudi Arabia. Anthropology was not popular in many countries; however, the Universities in Saudi Arabia are adopting Anthropology. * What is the opposite of the impression of tribes is the ideology of regression. The idea that the tribe gets its meaning from the patriarchal descent. Which is now called Saudi genealogy. One of the famous genealogy is Hamad Aljassar who dead in 2000(Alshamlan). * Golf scholars are interested in how migrants and other racial groups are racialized by the legal system. They are also interested in examining the built environment, the history of the transnational connection and the rapid social change (Deep & Winger).  United Arab Emirates  Anthropological studies, which are concerned with the privacy of the UAE community with a tribal background are rare and limited. * Most of the studies are written with other international anthropologists such as the ethnographic observations of a British Anthropologists Bertram Thomas. Tribes are the most form of UAE. Many anthropologists are interested in investigating the form of tribes. Many of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf are also based on the tribal system. * Moreover, there are many migrants in UAE from two sides: The first side is the center and the south of the Arabian Peninsula. The second side of the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf, contains many foreign migrations from the neighboring countries of Asia. There are also migrants from Iran. The main intention of those migrants is settling in UAE. * The UAE community is a multi-tribal community. A multi-cultural community that divides communities into socially and economically linked in different sectors of the workforce(Alsnagry).  Qatar and Bahrain  In Qatar and Bahrain, anthropology was not as popular as other fields, like many other countries in the Persian Gulf region. Anthropology is expanding in educational aspect. Many anthropologists are also concerned on the structure of the tribes in the Arab countries in the Persian Gulf region (Gardner).  North Africa   Egypt  Within the Arab-majority countries, Egypt, has established itself among the other Arab-majority countries as the main hub for anthropologists in the region, with Cairo being the center for most of this attention. The rest of the country remains relatively understudied. Increased attention to Cairo can be attributed to the rise of anthropological interest in cities, particularly to the diverse interdisciplinary scholarship. The centrality of Middle East area studies is largely responsible for the increase in anthropological attention towards Egypt. In addition to this is the accessibility of institutional support for US scholars. As of the early 21st century, the relationship of Egypt with anthropology remains under question. Egyptian anthropologist, Hania Sholkamy, remarks that there are four main points that shape this ongoing relationship: the relationship of methods to theory, the relationship between methods and their analysis, the relationship of culture to its determinants, and the relationship between having data and being able to evaluate it. The discipline of anthropology is in a constant state of judgment within Egypt, particularly when compared with the discipline of demography. The qualitative data more common in demography is given more attention than the theoretical and analytical methods associated with anthropology.  Morocco  In Morocco, topics of anthropological research include the ethnicization of Jews, the construction of ethnicity among Berber, Arab, and Haratine groups through agricultural practices, and how Berber ethnicities are politicized in ways that create raced and gendered notions of homeland.  Africa  The region of Africa has had a long history of being colonized by others in economic and cultural ways, which is why the study of anthropology in Africa is a relatively new discipline that is usually grouped with historical work. Before becoming a discipline in the region, Western anthropologists came to the area to study and conduct ethnographies pertaining to the native culture of those who inhabited the area. Anthropologists in African academia are still on looking for what anthropology means to them. While anthropology was initially used by states to gain knowledge about local cultures, it was later seen as a way to help them. After the recognition of its importance many universities and associations have institutionalized departments, journals and conferences to carry out this work. This article includes the history, development, and future of African Anthropology in different regions.  East Africa   Kenya  Map of Kenya Anthropological study in Kenya, like many other parts of Africa, was dominated by foreign British academia. They were focused on studying the ‚Äúother‚Äù and understanding them for state purposes. This era is known as the pre- independence period. There were very little local anthropologists after independence in 1963 until the 70s. The post-colonial era was filled with distrust for the subject of anthropology because of its link to previous colonizers. The East African Anthropological Association (EAAA) was founded in 2001 archaeology. This association was used to promote and unify anthropologists in East Africa and work towards a common goal. The EAAA was working to develop better programs in universities and create local opportunities for meetings within anthropological communities. It works with the Pan African Anthropological Association as well as many others in order to come up with ways to improve the country that they live in. = Growth and Development = Jomo Kenyatta The growth and development of anthropology in Kenya was largely due to colonialism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but as an actual discipline in the region, it wasn't well developed until the 1980s. In 1938, the subject of anthropology became locally known through Jomo Kenyatta, who wrote and published Facing Mt. Kenya, which was the first time any article was published from a native's perspective. The methodology of anthropology in Kenya is neither strictly Kenyan, nor is it strictly Euro-American, but rather a combination of the various methods between the nations. Due to the variety of methods that were being taught worldwide, as well as the education development in Kenya, it was decided to create formal training for the discipline. There's evidence of this from their two major universities of the University of Nairobi and Moi University. The University of Nairobi tended to disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, but taught them as separate departments, similar to England's separation of the departments; and Moi University tended to the same disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, but taught the disciplines together in the same department of Anthropology, as is taught in the U.S. = British and German Studies = The majority of British, as well as German, anthropologists dominated Kenya with their studies focusing solely on the groups of people who were considered to be distinct, or ‚Äúotherly‚Äù. While some anthropologists studied these groups in order to achieve dominance over them, other anthropologists reasoned studying the communities for educational purposes before their culture no longer existed due to colonizing. Thus, causing a means for Kenya anthropologists to disassociate with colonialism because of its harsh effects on Africans and their culture. This forced the local anthropologists to rethink about socio-cultural studies, including their own discipline and how it aided in colonialism. Even Jomo Kenyatta, who had benefited from his education and studies, was struggling with the decision on whether to associate with the discipline anymore. Louis Leakey and wife Mary Louis Leakey aided in bringing archaeology and physical anthropology to light in Kenya. He work as a curator in the Coryndon Memorial Museum, which is an important establishment that helps to keep excavation sites accessible, such as Koobi Fora, Olorgesailie, and the Hyrax Hill, to both local and foreign archaeologists. In the 1950s, alongside his wife, Leakey found various primate fossils, including those of Australopithecus Boisei (1959), Homo Habilis (1964), and Kenyapithecus (1967). In 1960, he established the Institute of Primate Research (IPR) which helped in comprehending human evolution and biomedical research for health challenges in Africa, such as HIV/AIDS. = Teaching and Education = Daniel Arap Moi Since the discipline of anthropology was associated with colonialism, the nation-state of Kenya did not identify with its trajectories and could not support it. It wasn't until Daniel Arap Moi, who succeeded Jomo as president, made culture a central means for socio-economic aspects, making anthropology slowly begin to gain popularity again among locals due to its national cultural ethos. In 1965, the University of Nairobi established its Institute for Development Studies which contained two aspects of social science and cultural divisions. The social science aspect of the department went on to develop its own Institute of Development Studies, which carried out economic development but through a multidisciplinary approach. The cultural divisions aspect used resources that informed university students, as well as regionally, from a cultural instruction perspective. In 1970, the two subjects came together and were known as the Institute of African Studies (IAS), in which students researched in African archaeology, history, social anthropology, musicology, linguistics, oral literature, traditional arts, crafts, and social systems; this institute even contributed to some of the top scholars such as musicologists P.N. Kavyu and Washington Omondi, historians H.S.K. Mwaniki and William R. Ochieng‚Äô, and writers Okot p‚ÄôBitek and Taban lo Liyong. In 1986, the IAS had established its first anthropology training program, providing courses of medical, linguistic, economic, and ecological anthropology and material culture (Amuyunzu-Nyamongo, 2006). = Anthropological Future = The future of the discipline of anthropology consists of research projects dedicated to resolving health issues, such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, so it is not a surprise that most anthropologists in Kenya today are either medical anthropologists or those anthropologists who study medical issues. Many of these local anthropologists are sought out for help by national non-government health organizations, like United State Agency for International Development, Family Health International, Engenderhealth, PATH, Population Council, African Population and Health Research Center, African Medical Research Foundation, the World Health Organization and the Ford Foundation. Kenyan anthropologists do not conduct research for personal needs, but for needs of their nation-state and those funding agencies that they provide information to for health resolutions. In response to this upcoming need, universities are developing programs, like Anthropology in Developing Countries, Applied Anthropology, Medical Anthropology, and Anthropology and Infectious Diseases, that educate for cultural developmental skills.  West Africa   Cameroon  Before Cameroon was split by the British and French in 1915 it was under the control of the German government since 1884. Very little Anthropological work was done until this time when the state recognized how useful knowing more about its people would be. Phyllis Kaberry and Elizabeth Chilver were two prominent researchers in West African area in the min-1900s. Kaberry, a trained anthropologist from England, studied women in a local tribe from the \\"grassfields\\" of Cameroon. She also co-wrote several books and papers on topics concerning female roles in specific African cultures. In 1973 the first institute in Cameroon with an anthropology department was established. In 1978 departments that were seen as not practical were starting to be eliminated. After closing, reopening, and hiding within other departments, Anthropology was finally on the rise in the early 1990s. = Teaching = The University of Yaound√©-I is a main institution in the area providing students with opportunities to gain degrees in Anthropology. Other Institutions of importance are the University of Ngaoundere and the University of Buea which in 1992 added anthropology departments. Both of these universities produce scholars from the local communities and they promote research that is of common interest to the area. Language being a barrier in academia until its independence, in 1960, where universities were fashioned in the European style of education systems. The University of Buea, a public university, offered the subjects in the English language which increased the number of local students that attend. Largely associated with sociology, the first person to gain a PhD in Social Anthropology from Cameroon was Paul Nkwi in 1975. In 1993, a B.A. in anthropology could be received form the University of Yaound√©. = Research = CODESRIA A stepping-stone organization was CODESRIA, which was an organization that helped develop and promote anthropology as an institution. It facilitated the establishment of the Pan African Anthropological Association (PAAA) in the 80s. The PAAA is cooperative movement that unified Anthropologists from all over Africa. Its goal was to make anthropology known again as a useful and essential department that Africa needed. This association is holding conferences annually, starting in 1989, to advance Anthropology and find ways to solve problems for the future. Some dominant research topics in the area are witchcraft, chiefdoms, health, violence and ethno-history. The PAAA started encouraging communication of cross disciplines to benefit Africa as a whole by discovering new ways of resolving issues. A leading journal in Africa is the African Anthropology, now known as The African Anthropologist, allows research from all over Africa to be shared and more easily accessible.  Southern Africa   Stellenbosch/Western Cape  Map of the Western Cape with Stellenbosch highlighted = History = The history of the discipline of anthropology in South Africa comes from the result of political and ideological interpretations of the research there. In the 1920s, the South African Association for the Advancement of Science was established, and it was here that anthropology was known. Presentations were given by archeologists, linguists, anthropologists, and ethnologists; there was also a South African Journal of Science that many researchers published in as well. During the years of the 1940s to the 1990s, anthropology grew to be less popular due to the apartheid period, which in educators had strict guidelines as to what they could and couldn't teach in the classroom, and they were not permitted to teach anything else but that particular curriculum. Anthropological studies and research were offered at sixteen different universities, in which sociocultural anthropology and archaeology were offered within the discipline, and in another department, linguistics, African studies, and Gender studies were linked in the discipline. Instead of using the word or teaching anthropology, the universities, more specifically Stellenbosch University, taught volkekunde, which means knowledge about people, and it was first known from pre-WWII German passage that was written by V√∂lkerkunde. This expansion of the discipline was also known as ethnology or cultural anthropology, and it was paired with aspects of the apartheid period. This caused a division between social anthropology and volkekunde, as well as Afrikaans-medium universities and English-medium universities, respectively. = Stellenbosch University and South African Relationship with the U.K. and U.S. = Stellenbosch University (an Afrikaan-medium university) had established its first anthropological department due to Werner Eiselen, who was the Permanent Secretary in the National Department of Native Affairs, as well as being a developer of the concept of apartheid, with Hendrik Verwoerd being his partner. There were then new universities that were built in the 1960s, specifically for black students, which led to the continuation of the two types of universities within the area. The professors who obtained jobs at the new universities had a background that dealt with a volkekunde style of teaching anthropology. This entire movement didn't appeal to those who identified themselves as social anthropologists in the discipline. Even with this division of the methods to anthropological research, there was a mutual respect and influence for social anthropological studies that were being conducted by researchers in the U.K., as well as the U.S. Most students were moving on to proceed in getting their doctoral degrees preferred to attend the University of Cambridge, due to its influence of academia through anthropologists who were South African natives, such as Meyer Fortes, Isaac Schapera, and Max Gluckman. South African anthropologists, such as Jean Comaroff and John Comaroff and Namibian-born Rob Gordon, who began their studies in their home region of South Africa, and more specifically at the Afrikaans-medium University of Stellenbosch, also had influence with the U.S. in their research. = Self-Exile and Volkekunde Conference = The University of South Africa In the 1960s, South African anthropologists made the decision to start leaving their country for careers and research studies because of the apartheid methods, the inequality within their societies, and there was an increase in the violence that was surrounding the region. In 1967, a committee was formed in order to begin negotiating anthropological conferences that were held at the University of South Africa, which added to the separation and tension of the social anthropologists and those who studied volkekunde. Ten years later, black anthropologists started to attend these conferences, and this made the volkekunde group to initiate another new conference that was only to host research projects to those studying ethnology; this new conference was known in the Afrikaans language as Vereniging van Afrikaanse Volkekundiges, which is translated to mean Association of Afrikaans Ethnologists. This conference excluded entry to those who did not speak the original Afrikaans language of South Africa, or the regional state area, and it continued to have majority and favor until the 1980s when the social anthropologists decided to have their own conference as well. = Social Anthropology Conference = The Association for Anthropology in Southern Africa (AASA) was established in 1987 excluded membership into the group for those who believed in the apartheid concepts. Before anyone could become members of the conference, they were to sign a document, or a contract, saying that they reject any and all apartheid theories and concepts. Regardless of this new conference, the methods of volkekunde remained to be prominent in the discipline of anthropology, though during the 1980s, the anthropology department of then known Rand Afrikaans University, which was one of the newer White Afrikaans-medium universities in the area, officially denounced volkekunde as their way of research, in fact, the entire teaching department of this discipline turned their backs to apartheid concepts entirely. Later on, Stellenbosch University, which was where the first volkekunde department to be established, was closed down in the mid-1990s. A few years afterward, the discipline of social anthropology was introduced within the Department of Sociology. The new association of Anthropology South Africa was a cause to link the two distinguished branches of volkekunde and social anthropology. Its first annual conference was in 2001. In 2004, it became one of the founding members of the World Council of Anthropology Associations in Brazil. There aren't very many volkekundiges, or ethnologists, who have membership within the ASnA, nor do most of them attend any of the conferences that are held. A majority of those who do attend the annual conference are young, predominantly black, postgraduate anthropologists, but there are also a growing number of faculty members from the South African University anthropology programs who participate as well. Though the faculty participation numbers are growing, the overall number of memberships within the ASnA fluctuate from year to year. This is due to postgraduates, who are members only having a membership for a year or two in order to obtain their dissertations. There is also a close link between membership and conference attendance, meaning that since the conferences are held in venues that are less accessible or less desirable, this doesn't attract many anthropologists to participate and fewer people sign up for memberships. = Topics of Research and Publication = Some of the topics of research for sociocultural anthropologists in South Africa consist of medical anthropology, mostly concerning the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the region, development anthropology, urbanism, science and natural resources, conflict, violence and policing, human rights, identity politics and belonging, and popular culture. There isn't much attention paid to subjects, such as economic anthropology, state formation, and religion and religious movements. Anthropologists at South African universities mostly publish to edited volumes and special theme collections in interdisciplinary and disciplinary journals in their own country, as well as internationally. One significant publication venue for South African anthropologists is the journal formerly known as the volkekunde's Tydskrif van Suid Afrikaanse Volkekunde, which translates to Journal of South African Ethnology. The journal changed its name to Anthropology Southern Africa in 2002.  Postcolonial African Anthropology   The Future of the Discipline  Anthropologists, who studied in Africa and began their research from basic curiosities, cannot be of aid to how the discipline stays in existence. Anthropology thrived from outside and inside perspectives of the same region or aspect of culture; having a missions civilisatrice perspective divided observer and participant, instead of taking into consideration the culture within the region from the perspectives of those who have lived there. The aspect of not being able, or not wanting to, collaborate with natives from the country was due to the Malinowskian model. Researchers developed their own personal objectives and reasoning to what and who they were observing in the field. This caused an explicit division of Africa into several regions based on finding and observing the exotic ‚ÄúOther‚Äù from various basis of culture, race, and location. The concept of reflexivity helped anthropologists to realize that their personal needs and reasoning for research correlated with the aspect of seeing people differently instead of similarly. There was no insight from those who had inhabited the continent for centuries, and the country is not well represented. There was not a lot of support for methods that contradicted what had already been practiced and known within the discipline. Universally, there were various debates about the methodology of the discipline in relation to folklore, co-production with aid of natives, and boundaries within the field. These aspects had not been taken into consideration when observing the region. Anthropology surviving in Africa were due to not observing Africa explicitly as scientific (racially or geographically), not seeing African identities and cultures as scientific, redefining the Malinowskian model, and making the methods of fieldwork and participant observation more flexible. Native anthropologists called for creative diversity and outsider anthropologists to observe themselves and how they contributed to the professional collaboration with those who were native to the region. This methodology or concept did not replace outside methods, but correlated the two methods together in knowledge about culture.

Accordingly, at the end of the 19th century, the French Foreign Legion, and more particularly the 2nd Foreign Regiment 2e RE set on foot the mounted companies () in order to allow these infantry contingents to make movement over long distances while avoiding fatigue. Horses could not move for long distances in the desert, without water supply, accordingly, others means of displacement were required to be imagined. fanion of the mounted company of the 2e REI.  Origin and history since 1881  The first mule mounted units of the French Army, were in reality the two infantry battalions of colonel Yusuf in July 1843. However, these battalions did not have any future follow- ups. At the end of 1880, in Algeria, the French troops started to occupy the oasis in the south, around the Saharan border. However, these forward operating posts had to be filled with supplies which made the convoys supplying them a tentative target. The first Legion mule mounted unit was imagined by colonel de N√©grier, regimental commander of the 2nd Foreign Regiment in 1881 during launching of combat columns. On 14 December 1881, 50 Legionnaires mounted on mules brought back the first victories. In 1913, the 3rd Mounted Company of the 2nd Foreign Regiment became the Mounted Company of Morocco (), forming a corps. History of the Mounted Companies of the 2nd Foreign Regiment During the war, the corps was in charge of maintaining the security of communication between F√®s and Taza (). Assigned to the 3rd Foreign Regiment on 15 November 1920, the corps was reassigned to the 2e REI on 1 January 1922, and reassumed the original designation. On 1 October 1923, the Mounted Company of Morocco became the 1st Mounted Company of the 2e REI, following the creation of a second mounted company at the corps of the infantry regiment. Designated as Mounted Company of the 2e REI on 1 October 1930, the company stationed at Ksar-√®s-Souk at the end of the pacification of Morocco. From that date, a part of these mounted units would be motorized. On 1 January 1950, the last mounted company (), the Mounting () of the 4th Foreign Regiment was dissolved at Ksar-es-Souk.  Particularities  Starting 1884, the organization of the Mounted Companies was fixed at 215 men, 3 horses and 120 mules. The officers were on horse, the Adjudants had each a mule, as far as the others, they had one mule for two. One sits on the mule and the other marches. Every couple of hours, at the command of \\"change, mount\\" (), the legionnaires would change places. The more senior legionnaire of the two is the responsible of the mule (\\"titled\\") and the other is the (\\"doubler\\"). One mounted company progressed at 6 Km per hour, however in case of necessity, the mule can sustain a rapid paste and the man on foot can follow in a fast tempo cadence. The normal rhythm was 10 to 15 hours of marching per day, or the possibility of covering some 40 to more than 70 km in one day, which created a considerable advantage in the desert. The legionnaires assigned to these units were the selected tier one () and only the most robust volunteers were able to hope to serve the \\"Mounting\\".

It is one of four superfamilies classified as part of the suborder Stylonurina. Kokomopteroids have been recovered from deposits of Early Silurian to Late Devonian age in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Description  Kokomopteroids are stylonurines with a spiniferous appendage V and a posterior notch on the metastoma. The superfamily forms two distinct clades; the Kokomopteridae (including the genera Kokomopterus and Lamontopterus) and the Hardieopteridae (including the genera Hardieopterus, Tarsopterella and Hallipterus). The Kokomopteroidea retains primitive Hughmilleria-type prosomal appendages for unsuitable raking through the bottom sediments of marine environments. As such, the members of the superfamily were likely scavengers. The Hardieopteridae display some sweep-feeding characteristics similarly to members of the superfamilies Hibbertopteroidea and Stylonuroidea, including a broadening of the metastoma and the spines of the anterior prosomal appendages. Hardieopterids may even have been benthic bottomdwellers partially living buried in the substrate.  Systematics and genera  The Kokomopteroids are eurypterids classified as part of the suborder Stylonurina. They are a sister group to the Hibbertopteroidea, united by a median ridge on the carapace between the lateral eyes and a distal thickening to the podomeres of the prosomal appendages. The primitive hibbertopteroid Drepanopterus is a sister taxon to all other hibbertopteroids and shares certain characteristics with the Kokomopteroidea (such as a clavate telson). Kokomopteroidea contains two families, the Kokomopteridae and Hardieopteridae. The Kokomopteridae is defined as kokomopteroids with undifferentiated opisthosoma with a marginal rim and the appendages II-V being spiniferous as in Lamontopterus, with appendage VI not being spiniferous, as in Kokomopterus. The Hardieopteridae is defined as kokomopteroids with lateral pleurae on the metasoma and pretelson, large lunate scales on the posterior carapace margin and a clavate telson. The opisthosoma shows both second and fourth order differentiation into a mesosoma and metasoma in the Hardieopteridae, with appendage V being spiniferous and VI being non-spiniferous as in Hardieopterus. The Kokomopteridae is only known from the Silurian, the temporal range of the Hardieopteridae extends further to the Late Devonian.

This proteins are part of a multigene family (PF08031) that can be found in plants, fungi and bacteria.Daniel B, Wallner S, Steiner B, Oberdorfer G, Kumar P, van der Graaff E, et al.

An homonym of this family is the (S)-reticuline oxidase or berberine bridge enzyme from California poppy (Eschscholzia californica), the responsible of catalyzing the conversion of (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerine. This conversion is made by an oxidative ring closure reaction. The product of this reaction is the C-C bond and is referred to as the berberine bridge. Also, marks a branch point in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. As mentioned above, BBE-like enzymes are in the large family of FAD-linked oxidases. Regarding the structure of this particular family, they have a FAD binding module formed by the N- and C- terminal parts of the protein. There is a substrate binding module that, in collaboration with isoalloxazine ring of FAD, disposes the environment for efficient substrate binding and oxidation.Daniel B, Konrad B, Toplak M, Lahham M, Messenlehner J, Winkler A, Macheroux P., \\"The family of berberine bridge enzyme-like enzymes: A treasure-trove of oxidative reactions\\" Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics (2017), https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2017.06.023 thumb482x482pxA: Structural properties of the BBE-like enzymes.

Purification process  Cell cultures of Berberis beaniana (B. beaniana), which in this certain experiment are taken as an example, were harvested 10‚Äì12 days, contained large amounts of proto-berberines, mainly jatrorrhizine. These quaternary alkaloids have a strong inhibitory effect on the BBE, so they had to be removed. In order to eliminate most of these interfering cationic substances, the enzyme solution was treated first with carboxymethyl-Sepharose and subsequently with dextrancoated charcoal. After that, the resulting solution was fractionated using standard procedures and generated, after isoelectric focusing, a single protein band in SDS gel electrophoresis. In the end, the obtained enzyme had been purified 450 times and contained 0.7% of the activity present in the crude extract at the beginning.Stevens, P.; Naotaka N.; Meinhart H.Z.

Properties  pH scale showing the BBE-like enzyme's optimum pH and isoelectric point. The BBE-like enzyme's optimum pH is 8.9, this means it works in an alkaline medium, but the isoelectric point of the homogeneous enzyme is located at pH 4.9, which is a rather an acid medium. This value was obtained with isoelectric focusing and chromatofocusing techniques. The enzyme broad temperature range is between 40-50 degrees Celsius. The molecular weight of the protein was determined by two processes that show two different results: by SDS gel electrophoresis comes to be 54 kD, and by gel filtration on AcA 54 the enzyme corresponds to a molecular weight of 49 kD, adopting globular shape. A purification study shows that the true molecular weight is in the range of 52 ¬±4 kD. On the other hand, total activity decreases drastically during the stationary phase.  Known functions  BBE-like enzymes serve as a catalyzer for a wide range of reactions. All the way from two-electron oxidations as observed in (At)BBE-like 15 to four- electron oxidations as seen in Dbv29. BBE-like enzymes are involved in the synthesis of plenty of isoquinoline alkaloids such as the conversion of (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerineAndreas W., Franz H., Toni M. K., Anton G., and Peter M.

Research on this matter is rare since it is very complex and had never been looked into until recently. New studies reveal that BBE-like enzymes are involved in the biological synthesis of the alkaloids intermediates communesin as well as chanoclavine (I). The mechanism through which reactions are catalyzed by these BBE-like enzymes has not been found yet, but the resulting conformation of the products suggests that a similar coupling of substrate oxidation and ring formation occurs in these processes.  BBE-like enzymes in plants  BBE-like enzymes in plant physiology play a role in primary metabolism catalyzed by members of this family. The oxidation of a variety of alcohol groups supplies a first understanding of the origin of the BBE-like enzyme family, present in reactions like oxidation of mono and polysaccharides. It seems that they are present in a huge percentage of plants. A common reaction of BBE-like enzymes from plants is the oxidation of carbohydrates at the anomeric center to the appropriate lactones. A member of these enzymes is hexose oxidase (HOX) from Chondrus crispus, a red algae that belongs to the division of Rhodophyta. But is more related to bacterial BBE- like enzymes than to members present in plants. Other example of carbohydrate oxidizing BBE-like enzyme is nectarin V (Nec5) from tobacco. Its function is to convert glucose to gluconolactone. Nec5 is related with the pathogen defense system of plants, because it protects reproductive organelles.  Medical applications  Berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) is a central enzyme in the biosynthesis of berberine, a pharmaceutically important alkaloid. The enzyme itself hasn't had extensive research carried on, and has very limited, if any, specific medical application. On the other hand, berberine is highly regarded for its interactions with several diseases. Berberine has been known to influence weight loss, and this antiobesity effect may benefit all conditions related to increased body mass such as hypertension, dyslipidemia or pre-diabetes. This may reduce the likelihood of getting sedentary diseases such as heart failure or other problems related to this issue. By being an AMPK activator like Metformin, it acts similar, affecting metabolism in a way that may reveal useful applications to treat type-2 diabetes. Overall, this alkaloid might be useful in the treatment and study of diseases like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), some types of cancer, heart problems or dyslipidemia.

Since 1967, site operators had improperly handed high-risk substances by expelling them into public sewer systems throughout the township. Established in 1962, CPS Madison Industries, located in Middlesex County, New Jersey, has remained a large competitor in the copper and zinc industry producing compounds primarily for food additives, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. CPS Madison Industries was declared to be a superfund site as of September 8, 1983, due to its improper handlings of Volatile Organic Compounds, and has since been undergoing groundwater pump and treatment systems since 1991.  Origins  Originally Madison Township, Old Bridge Township was assimilated in 1975 to refrain from confusion with the borough of Madison, located in Morris County, New Jersey. Based on the 2010 United States Census, there were 65,357 people living in Old Bridge Township and it is 40.783 square miles in total size. The Township of Old Bridge is home to the 14th worst superfund site in the United States of America, due to its contamination of Volatile Organic Chemicals.  Company history  CPS Madison Industries was established in 1962 and declared to be a superfund site on September 8, 1983. Ciba Specialty Chemicals acquired the company in 1998 and kept the company until 2001. Ciba Inc. was then purchased by BASF Corporation, the largest chemical company in the world, hence, the company was now under the control of BASF. In 2010, BASF Corporation was officially held accountable for the superfund site. In 2015, Madison Industries acquired the site and currently, Old Bridge Chemicals Inc. is in charge of the location. In 1983, the case of the City of Perth Amboy v. Madison Industries was initiated and was not concluded until 2015, battling against two polluters for contamination of a city water supply in violation of the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control and Water Pollution Control Acts.  Superfund design  The main issues with the superfund site arose when the BASF corporation was in control of the area in 2010. Though the CPS Madison Industries property was declared to be a superfund site in 1983, evident attempts at taking action had only began to appear as of 2010.  State Intervention  Tracing back from today, site operators since 1967 improperly handled hazardous substances by expelling them into the public sewer system. Not until 2010 was the BASF Corporation held accountable for the cleanup process of the CPS Madison site. Groundwater pump and treat systems were put into effect and ran by the company who owned the location at the time, eventually making a milestone when falling under the control of BASF. The groundwater pump and treat systems are still in usage currently along with various fencing methods and signs to keep people away from the land.  National intervention  The EPA states that federal government had decided to address the CPS Madison site in two stages including interim and long remedial. Regarding superfund sites, the EPA claims that ‚Äúsites with HRS scores of 28.5 or greater are eligible for placement on the NPL.\\" CPS Madison Industries remains on the National Priority List, eventually lowering on the scale as clean ups occur. Following the locations classification as a superfund site by the EPA, with the aid of the superfund reserve, the EPA was able to put in place water purifying systems in attempt to repair the damages made to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, enhanced the groundwater pump and treat systems, and commenced with in 2015 and are still proceeding with remedial investigations administered and organized by the EPA and carried out by the state to potentially be able to once again use the sites land in a safe fashion.  Health and environmental hazards  Many of the problems with the superfund program are illustrated by the CPS Madison Industries case, according to the Star Ledger. The company is blamed for contaminating Perth Amboy, New Jersey‚Äôs water supply, but still has not cleaned it up. The EPA has claimed to have assumed procedural changes to expedite cleanups as stated by the state news service from the New York Times, including stricter supervision of contracted clean up companies and more emphasis on public disclosure. The hazardous chemicals used at the CPS Madison Industries‚Äô superfund site consisted of volatile organic compounds (VOC), as well as zinc sulfate and copper compounds.  Chemical contamination  Volatile Organic Compounds are organic chemicals that consist of a high vapor pressure at regular room temperature. Many Volatile Organic Compounds are hazardous air pollutants that can contribute to climate change. ‚ÄúAt present, not much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause cancer in humans,‚Äù according to Wikipedia. These composites can potentially harm humans in a fatal way, and along with zinc sulfate and copper cause trauma to the earth and nature surrounding.  Clean up  At the CPS Madison Industries superfund site, clean up methods were initiated originally with groundwater pump and treat systems along with efforts to put up fencing around Prickett‚Äôs Pond and Prickett‚Äôs Brook which is downgradient from the site. Part of the property was owned by Old Bridge Chemicals Inc. and another part by Madison Industries. The Old Bridge Chemicals Inc. side of the site is currently clear of all toxins, but the Madison Industries side according to the EPA is neither clear nor has the ability to be used safely by people, and is still undergoing remedial investigations that began in 2015.  Initial cleanup  The initial cleanup of the CPS Madison Industries site began in 1991, after the EPA recognized the area as a superfund site in 1983, with implementing groundwater pump and treat systems. Pump and treat is a common method for cleaning up groundwater contaminated with dissolved chemicals, where the water is pumped from wells to an above-ground treatment system to remove the contaminants. Prickett‚Äôs Pond and Prickett‚Äôs Brook, which are downstream from the superfund area, though they were not for human use prior to the site, have enclosures such as fencing around the areas as well as ‚ÄúNo Trespassing‚Äù signs to serve as warnings.  Current status  Air stripping techniques are presently used, in addition to the other cleanup methods, to remove the Volatile Organic Compounds by moving air through contaminated waters in above ground treatment systems. On site response actions are still being taken with feasibility studies underway stating that the CPS or Old Bridge Chemicals Inc. side is currently safe, but the Madison Industries side of the property is still under intense cleanup and investigations.

The industrial site has been out of operation since the early 1980s after a fire revealed 70 drums containing silver cyanide, ethyl acetate, and acetonitrile. The drums caught the attention of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by 1995 the Horseshoe Road Complex was on the National Priorities List. The site had three areas consisting of the Atlantic Development Corporation (ADC), Horseshoe Road Drum Dump, and Sayreville Pesticide Dump. The neighboring Atlantic Resources Corporation, the location for precious metal recovery, is addressed with the Horseshoe Road Complex (HRC) site due to the intermixing of chemical contamination. The on-site contamination is not an immediate threat to the surrounding community, although prolonged or repeated exposure to the site itself, will result in health effects. The HRC Superfund site is now in its final steps of cleanup in accordance to the EPA's plan.  Origins  Sayreville, New Jersey is located in Middlesex County on the Raritan River, and near the Raritan Bay. According to the 2010 United States Census, the Borough of Sayreville accommodates 42,704 people, 15,636 households, and 11,414 families and has a population density that is 132% higher than New Jersey.  Town history  Sayreville was originally named roundabout after the riverbeds, until the 1860s when it was renamed after James R. Sayre. James R. Sayre was the co-founder of Sayre and Fisher Brick Company which was the first company to take advantage of Sayreville's substantial clay deposits. Sayreville was incorporated as a township up until 1919 when it was reincorporated as the Borough of Sayreville after a referendum was held on the matter. The Borough of Sayreville received scientific notice for their clay deposits as one of the world's major sources of museum-quality fossils.  Company history  The Atlantic Development Corporation facility on Horseshoe Road was leased by several companies from 1950 to the early 1980s, housing many operations including the production of sealants, roofing materials, polymers, and urethane. The facility consisted of several buildings, many which are demolished today due to structural safety hazards. The site contained incinerators as well, which were used for precious metals recovery during its years of operation.  Superfund designation  Local and National intervention was involved in the recovery of the Horseshoe Road Complex site. Locally, the Edison Wetlands Association kept the community informed about the state of the Horseshoe Road Superfund site, the association also helped to advance the progress of assessing health risks that the site posed to the surrounding community. State intervention from the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, partnered with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry was required in order to evaluate the hazards remaining on site, and in the aquatic life near the site. Nationally, the EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List, and due to the efforts of the EPA, as well as local and statewide organizations, the final steps for recovery should be completed by the end of 2017.  State intervention The Edison Wetlands Association (EWA) was the main local organization involved in recovery of the superfund site. In 1999 The EWA made a request for the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to evaluate the potential health threats posed by the site. The Edison Wetlands Association was primarily concerned with health threats presented to trespassers on the site, as well as the consumers of ‚Äúblue crabs‚Äù which are found in the Raritan river adjacent to the site. Following the request of the EWA, the ATSDR and the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS) evaluated the Horseshoe Road Complex (HRC) site in a health consultation on June 28, 2000. The ATSDR is ‚Äúrequired by law to conduct a public health assessment at each of the sites on the EPA National Priorities List‚Äù .. With the data from the 1999 Remedial Investigation the ATSDR/NJDHSS completed two Health Consultations on the Horseshoe Road Complex site in 2000 and 2001 which found that it is unlikely that trespassers experience any adverse health effects upon exposure to the site; however, the Atlantic Resources facility (precious metals recovery operation) within the HRC site puts trespassers at risk to physical hazards. Regarding the ‚Äúblue crabs‚Äù, 24 blue crab samples were collected from 11 locations including 12 crab muscle tissue samples, as well as 12 crab hepatopancreas (digestive gland) tissue samples. The EWA's effort to inform the surrounding community of the Horseshoe Road site was assisted with a Technical Assistance Grant (TAG) granted by the EPA.  National intervention  The Horseshoe Road Complex site was brought to the EPA's attention after over 70 drums of toxic waste were exposed following a brush fire in the early 1980s. The HRC site was recommended to placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) on September 29, 1995. In order for a site to be placed on the NPL it must evaluate the site based on the Hazard Ranking System (HRS). The HRS ‚Äúis a numerically based screening system that uses information from initial, limited investigations to assess the relative potential of sites to pose a threat to human health or the environment‚Äù. The EPA considers sites receiving an HRS score of 28.5 and above eligible to be places on the NPL. Following the investigation of the Horseshoe Road Complex, the site was given HRS score of 51.37, qualifying the HRC site to be placed on the National Priorities List to begin clean-up.  Health and environmental hazards  Several chemical hazards from the Atlantic Development Corporation, Horseshoe Road Drum Dump and the Sayreville Pesticide dump within the Horseshoe Road Complex were investigated and recorded in different layers of soil on site, as well as in the adjacent marsh and Raritan River. The ‚ÄúBlue Crabs‚Äù in the river, which are consumed by locals were investigated for possible health effects. Much of the findings concluded that the soil, sediments, and crabs were contaminated by the chemicals on the site.  Surface soil contamination  Upon investigation of the surface soil at the Horseshoe Road Complex site, Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well as semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), were discovered in shallow soil on the HRC site. VOCs are common air pollutants found in America. (‚ÄúVolatile Organic Compounds‚Äù, 2017) The VOCs and SVOCs found on site included methylene chloride, trichloroethylene (TCE), benzene, methoxychlor, tetrachlorethylene (PCE), and xylene.  Subsurface soil contamination  The subsurface soil contamination was predominantly volatile organic compounds. Inorganic compounds such as arsenic and antimony were found at elevated levels of the subsurface soil.  Site-Wide groundwater contamination  Groundwater contamination on the Horseshoe Road Superfund site was found within the first 30 feet below ground surface. The contamination included high levels of inorganic compounds in monitoring wells on the Horseshoe Road site. The contamination of the groundwater was a result of plumes from both the Atlantic Development Corporation as well as the Atlantic Resources Corporation.  Raritan River surface water and sediment contamination  High concentrations of contaminants were found upriver of the drainageway that discharges surface runoff from the marsh adjacent to the Horseshoe Road site. Several water samples detected higher arsenic levels than the New Jersey surface water criteria.  Cleanup  Due to the complexity of the hazards at the Horseshoe Road Complex (HRC) site the EPA created a cleanup plan organized into three operational units. The first operational unit is the demolition of the structurally unstable buildings remaining at the HRC site. The underground storage tanks were removed before the demolition. The demolition of the remaining structures at the HRC site was completed in 2003. Operational unit two addresses the removal of contaminated soil and groundwater and operational unit three is concerned with the River and marsh sediment. The Record of Decision planned for the River and marsh sediment cleanup to be started in 2006.  Initial cleanup  In regard to operational unit two, the EPA decided first on unearthing approximately 52,000 to 10,0000 cubic yards of deeper soils. The deeper soils were an active source of groundwater contamination on the HSR cite. The cleanup of soil and contaminated groundwater at the Horseshoe Road Complex site began February 2008 and was completed November 2009. The third operation unit addressing the contaminated sediments in the marsh and Raritan River began its progress in the summer of 2015. The dredging and capping in the Raritan River, as well as the marsh, was finished in 2016.  Current status  All final actions in restoring the marsh should be completed in 2017. The last phase of the Horseshoe Road site remediation addressing the Raritan river and marsh sediments was started in 2015, and is planned to be completed in 2017 as well.

It is located on the northern bank of the Raritan River. Industrial, chemical and pesticide operations began in 1971 and eventually lead to the contamination of groundwater and exposure of workers to harmful dioxins. Throughout 1980 to 1988 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) conducted studies to determine if there were any threats being posed on the workers, community or environment by the BIP companies in their disposal of processed and stored chemicals. Three companies were identified as being involved in the contamination: Blue Spruce Chemical, Jame Fine Chemicals Inc., and National Metal Finishings Corp.. In 1994, a Record of Decision (ROD) which is a document containing the remediation tactic for a waste site, was made involving excavation, disposal and treatment of soil and groundwater. Currently no further actions have been planned however the site is still on the National Priorities List (NPL) due to the ongoing treatment of groundwater. Origins The Brook Industrial Park (BIP) is located in the Borough of Bound Brook in the Somerset County of New Jersey. The town is linked to the Raritan River by a stream, giving recreational use to the town‚Äôs people. Contamination of this river and the BIP‚Äôs soil and groundwater was discovered to be the result of misconduct of three companies. Blue Spruce Chemical, stored the defoliant ‚ÄúAgent Orange‚Äù and admitted to recklessly acting and putting others at risk by spilling pesticides. Jame Fine Chemicals Inc. discharged unpermitted wastewater into the Raritan River. National Metal Finishings Corp. discharged waste into groundwater. Town history Bound Brook, New Jersey is located in the Somerset county. It was first settled in 1681, and is currently with a population of 10,402 according to the 2010 United States Census. The town has a stream that flows into the Raritan River via GreenBrook on the eastern side of the borough. The source of the borough's name is the brook that was mentioned as a boundary in a Native American deed. The current Mayor is Robert P. Fazen, however during the superfund designation it was Mayor Ronald Fasanello. Company history Blue Spruce Chemical had formulated, mixed and stored pesticides from 1971 to 1982, after which the building was abandoned. Pollution of the BIP area was revealed after a neighbouring company showed concern to the Middle Brook Regional Health Commission in 1980. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) and Middle-Brook Regional Health Commission investigated the facility due to reports of worker illnesses finding ‚Äúinadequate waste disposal and housekeeping practices‚Äù due to ‚Äúfrequent spills of pesticides‚Äù. In 1983, the NJDEP did testing to which dioxin concentrations greater than one part per billion were found, considered hazardous and action level by the State of New Jersey. This led to the State taking action by conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) in order to collect data on site conditions, nature of the waste, assess risk to human health and the environment, and evaluate alternative remedial actions. ‚ÄúIn 1986, the company's owner pleaded guilty to criminal negligence in spilling pesticides during repackaging between 1977 and 1980.‚Äù so the company had admitted to reckless action that had the potential to harm someone. National Metal Finishings Inc. is a metal plating facility that had in 1985 received financial penalties from the State for unreported discharge of waste into groundwater over a ten-year period, and failure to comply with remedy actions recommended. Jame Fine Chemical Inc. had discharged unpermitted water into the Raritan River, and analysis of nearby pond samples showed high concentrations of volatile organic substances such as methylene chloride and trichloroethylene leading to an order in 1980 to end the releasing of wastewater into the river and to follow recommendations of treatment and disposal of waste. In 1982 a Civil Order was filed for liability cleanup meaning the government had found the company financially responsible for the reversal of damage it had originally caused. In 1984 and 1986 Jame Fine was cited for violations of the Resource, Conservation, and Recovery Act (RCRA), the public law that creates the framework for the proper management of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste. Superfund designation Studies done by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) throughout 1980 to 1988 lead to the discovery of soil and groundwater contamination due to various waste dumping and chemical spills that exceeded the State‚Äôs action level resulting in the Brook Industrial Park being placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1989. State intervention The NJDEP and Middle-Brook Regional Health Commission investigated the Blue Spruce Chemical facility due to reports of worker illnesses in 1982. Testing was conducted in 1983, once the building was abandoned, finding concerning results and leading to the involvement of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The NJDEP installed four monitoring wells around Blue Spruce Chemical facility in 1980 and samples for further analysis were taken. Samples of the Jame Fine production were taken in 1980 and 1982 for comparison to NJ Federal health-based drinking water standards. In 1989, a site visit was conducted by the New Jersey Department Of Health (NJDOH) and NJDEP finding the adjacent areas to the abandoned Blue Spruce building not closed off and evidence of worker activity. National intervention In July 1983, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) emergency funds were used by the EPA in order to lock the Blue Spruce building and cover the dioxin-contaminated area with asphalt as well as conducting a RI/FS. Additionally, in 1990, fencing was installed to eliminate accidental contact with contaminants within the soil. Eventually the Brook Industrial Park was added to the NPL in March 1989, ranked 13 of 108 NPL sites in New Jersey. Representatives of an Edison firm the EPA had hired, ICF Technology Inc. examined the site as part of the remedial investigation in the late December 1989. 1994 involved the EPA signing a Record of Decision (ROD) for the remedy of the site which included excavation, off site treatment and disposal of soil, groundwater, and building. Health and environment hazards Community concerns involved the continuing use of contaminated groundwater for drinkable and domestic uses, as well as the worker population facing risk of exposure to hazardous substances through inhalation, skin contact or ingestion, and the nearby residents to Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), heavy metals and pesticides. The site is seen as a contributor to the rate of cancer in Bound Brook as stated by the Bound Brook Health Department. TCDD Contamination Blue Spruce Chemical was known to have been involved in storing a defoliant labelled ‚ÄúAgent Orange‚Äù consisting of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) containing traces of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). A sampling programme was conducted by EPA contractors in 1983 in and around the Blue Spruce facility for possible TCDD contamination finding soil contamination ranging from 0.77 to 6.2 parts per billion (ppb) in northern and southern sides of the building whilst 5.7 ppb inside at ground level and 6.1 ppb in the basement, highly over the New Jersey State action level of 1 ppb. This dioxin has been classified as cancer causing to humans by the EPA ref> explaining the Bound Brook Health Department‚Äôs concern of the contamination being linked to the amount of cancer in the area. Groundwater contamination Residents of Bound Brook were advised by the Bound Brook Health Department against the consumption and use of private well water in 1981, however there had been records that showed well use was continued. Public wells within 3 miles of the site provide water to an estimated 290,000 people whilst the Raritan River is used for recreational and commercial purposes. Analysis of water run off samples and monitoring wells installed around the Blue Spruce facility provided evidence of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its breakdown products malathion, lindane and aldrin, as well as VOCs and pesticide compounds. Lindane and aldrin were also detected by the NJDEP downstream of the Raritan River. DDT is an endocrine disruptor (interferes with the endocrine or hormonal system), also considered likely to be a human carcinogen. The analysis of discharge water from the Jame Fine Inc. and ponded water samples in the area in 1980 showed many contaminants including methylene chloride, a possible carcinogenic and known inhalation hazard, broken down by the body to carbon monoxide potentially leading to carbon monoxide poisoning. Another contaminant being trichloroethylene, a producer of central nervous system depression resulting in insensitivity to pain, workplace exposure to this chemical has been associated with toxic effects in the liver and kidney. Inadequate safety measures Workers of the National Metal Furnishings Inc. had exposure to metal plating solvents and chromic acid documented in September 1982 by the Middle-Brook Regional Health Commission, finding the safety measures to protect workers from this exposure to be inadequate. The personnel working in the BIP risk exposure to the various contaminants through inhalation of vapours and direct skin contact with liquids or surfaces. Raritan River ecosystem Surface runoff water from the site to the Raritan River lead to the contamination of the river‚Äôs ecosystem with pesticides, TCDD, heavy metals and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Aquatic organisms are exposed to possible contact with these toxic substances and being poisoned or accumulating the contaminants within them. Clean up A Record of Decision (ROD), document involving the actions to remedy the hazardous site, was signed in 1994 by the EPA for various extractions and treatments of soil and groundwater. By 2006 all planned actions had been completed and a construction of a groundwater pump-and-treat system was in place. This system is currently in use and all industrial standards of the Brook Industrial Park had been restored. Initial cleanup The first operation was the emergency action in 1983 of the EPA securing the Blue Spruce Chemical building and covering any dioxin-contaminated area with asphalt. Once the site had been added to the NPL long term action was planned with RI/FS being conducted among other surveys determining the nature and extent of overall contamination. The treatment selected for the site was done in 1994, with the EPA signing a Record of Decision (ROD) for the ‚Äúdisposal of approximately 5,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil; demolition and disposal/incineration of the contaminated portions of the Blue Spruce building; and extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater, followed by reinjection of the treated water.‚Äù followed by the demolition of the building in August 1999, ‚Äúalong with the removal and disposal of approximately 500 cubic yards of wood, 400 tons of brick and concrete, and 500 tons of contaminated soil from the basement of the building‚Äù. By September 2006 the contaminated soil had all been removed, and a construction of the groundwater pump-and-treat system began and was completed in the summer, operating to this day. Current status All long-term actions have been completed apart from the ongoing groundwater pumping and treatment. The Brook Industrial Park remediated to industrial standards all remaining buildings on site, and they are available for light industrial use. Companies on site include: Jame Fine Chemicals, Inc. operating a pharmaceutical manufacturing operation and National Metal Finishings Corporation, continuing metal plating processes.

Once a marsh, the 2-acre area next to the Elizabeth River is primarily flat land that is slightly above sea-level. The company, known as the Chemical Control Corporation, worked as a hazardous waste disposal plant from 1972 until its condemnation in 1979. Before the April 21, 1980 fire, it was reported that over 50,000 drums of chemicals, ranging from dioxin, benzene, cyanide, toluene, ethylene dichloride and more, were present on the site. State intervention was taken prior to the fire, but it became a matter of national intervention following the fire due to the level of contamination that impacted the environment and community. Cleanup operations have been underway since the early 1980s. The Environmental Protection Agency is considering removing the site from the National Priorities List because of the extensive cleanup that has been done. Origins The Chemical Control Corporation superfund site is located in a highly industrial district of Elizabeth, New Jersey. The Elizabeth River, which runs from several counties in New Jersey, empties itself right in front of the site. The company was operated from 1972-1979 under several owners including William Carracino, Eugene Conlon, John Albert and William Collection. The buildup of chemical wastes began after failure to fix the incinerator. Under the ownership of Collection, the site reached over 50,000 drums of chemicals which resulted in Chemical Control being condemned in 1979 as a superfund site. Town history The city of Elizabeth is located in New Jersey. It is the largest city in Union County and also holds the largest county seat. Based on the 2010 census, Elizabeth is also the fourth largest city in New Jersey. It is composed of several districts and neighborhoods including Midtown, Bayway, Downtown or the Port of Elizabeth, West End, Elmora Hills, Frog Hollow, North End, Keighry Head, Peterstown, The Point, Quality Hill and Westminster. It is bordered by the towns of Roselle, Roselle Park, Union, Hillside, Newark and Linden, which is the site of the LCP Chemical, Inc. superfund site. The Elizabeth River, which runs through both Union and Essex County, empties ‚Äúunderneath a bridge on the S Front Street near Elizabeth Ave and S 1st St.\\" South Front Street is the location of the Chemical Control Corporation superfund site which had contaminated the Elizabeth River. Company history The Chemical Control superfund site was operated and run by the Chemical Control Corporation. It received a five-year operating permit in 1972 for its incinerator that passed the air quality tests. Between 1976 and 1977, the owner and operator of Chemical Control was William Carracino. During this period of time, he arranged for midnight dumpings throughout Elizabeth to \\"offset the buildup of inventory at the site.\\" He was indicted and convicted of this crime and was sentenced to ‚Äútwo consecutive three year terms and fined a sum of $21,000.\\" However, Carracino sold the company to Eugene Conlon and John Albert, who were allegedly linked to a well-known mob under the Genovese family. The two appointed William Collection as the new president. During this time, 30,000 drums of chemicals were recorded on site and Collection was ordered to get rid of them in a safe manner. He had refused to do so and by 1979 over 50,000 drums of chemicals were recorded to be on site. This led to the condemnation of the Chemical Control site in 1979. Superfund designation State and national intervention were enforced on the Chemical Control superfund site. The state of New Jersey initiated cleanup efforts through Peabody Coastal Services and from funding by the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund after the site was condemned in 1979. The 1980 fire at Chemical Control resulted in national intervention as a result of the magnitude of contamination that effected both the state of New Jersey and New York via the air, soil, and water. State intervention Prior to the Environmental Protection Agency intervention, the state of New Jersey initiated a cleanup of the site in 1979 when the company was taken over by Conlon and Albert. The state stated that the new owners of the site had to \\"eliminate the barrels that had built up on the site at a rate of 1,200 per month, to inventory and label all on-site drums, and to incinerate all burnable waste.\\" However, the state administrator who mandated the requirements did not state that the site was barred from accepting more chemicals. This resulted in an increase of 30,000 drums of chemicals to 50,000 drums of chemicals on site by 1979. As a result, an investigation by the Bureau of Hazardous Waste's was started which, \\"led to the suit filed against Chemical Control and its parent company, the Northern Pollution Control Company of New York. The owners of Chemical Control, Conlon and Albert, claimed that their company did not have sufficient funds to perform a cleanup. The Chemical Control records at the time showed only a few thousand dollars, so the state put the company in receivership.\\" After being condemned in 1979, Peabody Costal Services was hired to commence the cleanup of the site. Between 1979 and the fire of 1980, 8,000 to 10,000 drums of toxic and explosive chemicals were removed, along with \\"5 pounds of radioactive substances, 10 pounds of disease-bearing material, and nearly 400 pounds of explosive material.\\" The whole operation costed between $11 -$13 million and was all funded by the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund. National intervention At first, national intervention was not necessary due to the intense state efforts to clean up the site. However, \\"on April 21, 1980, an explosive fire at the Chemical Control Corporation's Elizabeth, New Jersey hazardous waste treatment facility sent a toxic mixture of gases and chemical particulates into the atmosphere. Fifty-five gallon drums containing a variety of chemicals rocketed two hundred feet in the air before they burst due to the intense heat. Temperatures reached 3,000¬∞ F., melting and fusing containers. An estimated 50,000 drums of hazardous waste burned for more than ten hours before the Elizabeth fire department was able to bring the fire under control at 9:15 a.m. During the fire, a plume of noxious smoke and ash blanketed a fifteen square-mile area northeast from the site.\\" The fire not only caused chemicals to become airborne, but also resulted in them entering water, groundwater and soil. Contamination of the environment and health risks of over 15 million people led the Environmental Protection Agency to intervene at the site. The site was proposed for admission to be put on the National Priorities List in October 1981 and was finally added in September 1983. The origin of the fire ‚Äúhas never been determined, although unstable chemicals are the prime suspect‚Äù Health and environmental hazards The damages caused by the Chemical Control Corporation superfund site effected both the surrounding environment and community of Elizabeth, New Jersey. The chemicals before the fire effected groundwater, soil and the nearby water way of the Elizabeth River. During the 1980 fire, chemicals became airborne and spread to neighboring towns and states. Numerous chemicals from the site, including benzene, PCBs, toluene and more, resulted in side effects of irritated eyes, vomiting, diarrhea and skin rashes. The long term effects from the exposure of the chemicals can be seen in firefighters who have developed lung diseases, cancer, blood disorders, and nerve damage. Chemicals involved As a result of both leaking drums of chemicals and the 1980 fire, the contamination of soil, surface water, ground water and air reached dangerous levels. Prior to the fire, the noted chemicals that were removed from the site included benzene, cyanide, military nerve gas, PCB's, dioxin and nitroglycerine. One of the more toxic chemicals that was reported on site was dioxin, which ‚Äúin its pure form, three ounces of dioxin in New York's water supply could kill everyone in the city‚Äù. Carracino admitted that there was one thousand 55-gallon drums of dioxin at the Chemical Control site. During the fire, the chemicals known to be onsite included \\"insecticides, mercury compounds, nitric and picric acids, benzene, toulene, solvents, plasticizers, alcohol, and ethylene dichloride.\\" The solvents on site including benzene and ethylene dichloride can cause sudden death, blindness, damage to kidneys, liver and lung damage, irregular heartbeat, and skin rashes. High mercury compound exposure can cause mercury poisoning leading to death or permanently damaged kidneys and brain. The exposure of insecticides can cause certain types of cancers, birth defects, irritation of eyes and skin and hormonal imbalance. Some of these side effects have been reported from firefighters and bystanders of the nearby communities. The chemicals that resulted in contamination were detected in different areas of the environment. The chemicals found in groundwater included hexachlorocyclopentadiene, PCBs, and toluene. Contaminates found in the air included benzene, PCBs, toluene, and xylene. The subsurface soil was analyzed and it was discovered that the chemicals of \\"VOCs, phthalate esters, PCBs, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons [were found] at depths of approximately 3 to 10 feet.\\". However, the amount of each chemical present on site is unknown Contamination of Elizabeth River Due to the 1980 fire and midnight dumpings by Carracino, the surface water of the Elizabeth River, which was in close proximity, had been contaminated by several chemicals. These chemicals included benzene, PCBs, toluene, trichloroethylene, and trihalogenated methanes. This also lead to the contamination of marine life in the river including, crabs, shellfish and fish. This raised awareness of the human health threats as a result of ingesting chemicals via marine life. Health threats The 1980 fire resulted in a widespread contamination of chemicals. On average, 15 million people were affected by the huge cloud of smoke and contaminates that arose and spread from both the surrounding towns of Elizabeth, New Jersey and also New York City. Those impacted the most were firefighters and residents in close proximity of the fire. It was reported that as a result of the fire, some of the chemicals were neutralized from the intense heat. In a book published by Lewis Regenstein, he reports that \\"on the other hand, many firefighters, bystanders, and residents as far away as Staten Island required treatment for irritated throats, eyes, lips, and skin. Some also suffered temporary loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and eye strain. Fire fighters and waste disposal workers were reported to be still suffering from dizziness and diarrhea six months after the fire.\\" In an article published in the Star Ledger, it was reported that ten years after the fire, \\"about 20 members of the fire department who were involved with battling the blaze, now suffer from cancer or other illnesses, including lung disease, blood disorders and nerve damage.\\" Firefighter Mularz, who was one of the men on duty during the blaze, reports that due to his own exposure, he was diagnosed with \\"permanent lung damage, mental problems and an incurable blood disorder.\\" Many of those affected by the fire who suffered from health problems are currently in lawsuits to seek out compensation Clean up A three-stage cleanup plan for the Chemical Control superfund site was initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency. It included two long-term remedial plans and one immediate action plan. After cleanup, the Environmental Protection Agency is considering removing the Chemical Control superfund site from the National Priorities List. Initial clean up After the 1980 fire, national intervention from the Environmental Protection Agency fueled cleanup efforts. A remedial plan was approved by William N. Hedeman Jr., the Director of the Office of Emergency and Remedial Response, in order to determine the extensive cleanup measures that needed to be taken. The research and analysis of this part alone costed $785,500 and would be completed in 12 months. The cleanup for the site was addressed in three stages, the first being an immediate action plan by the Environmental Protection Agency, followed by two long-term remedial phases. The immediate action by the EPA started in the early 1980s and included \\"removing and decontaminating 11 box trailers and one vacuum truck; clearing plugged storm sewers; sampling and removing 187 gas cylinders left at the site and one taken from the Elizabeth River; conducting a limited site investigation and a focused evaluation of the alternatives for cleanup to confirm reports that drums from the site had entered the river; and removing all containers found next to the site.\\" Following the immediate action of the Environmental Protection Agency, long term actions were initiated which included: ‚Äú(1) combining contaminated soil with a solidification agent so that the contaminants cannot migrate from the site; (2) removal of debris from earlier cleanup actions, including water collected during monitoring well installation, items recovered from the Elizabeth River under the initial cleanup action, used disposable equipment, and the decontamination pad; (3) sealing the sanitary sewer line under the site where it connects to the South Front Street storm sewer; (4) repairing the berm that separates the site from the Elizabeth River; and (5) collecting and analyzing environmental samples to ensure the effectiveness of the remedy, including an periodic evaluation to assess protectiveness of human health and the environment.‚Äù All three plans were completed. Current status The Chemical Control site is now \\"an empty lot of approximately 2 acres covered by crushed stone and secured by a chain link fence‚Äù. A most recent five-year review was completed on September 12, 2014 and the Environmental Protection Agency is considering removing the Chemical Control Corporation Superfund site from the National Priorities List However, the site has not been approved for reuse or redevelopment. As of 2019, the site was being used for storage purposes.

Landfill operations began in 1945, and continued until September 1972, when large amounts of toluene, benzene, chloroform, dichloroethylene, and methylene chloride were found, all of which have are a hazard to human health causing cancer and organ failure. Sharkey Landfill was put on the National Priority List (or NPL) in 1983, and clean up operations ran until the site was deemed as not a threat in 2004. Origins Colonization of Parsippany dates all the way back to 1700, starting as a collection of English settlers to a large city of about 53,000 people. Ciba-Geigy, founded in the 1970s, made plants all over the east coast, placing one in what is now the bustling city of Parsippany. Town history The area of Parsippany was part of the glacier until 13,000 BCE. Native Americans had settled the area first 12,500 years ago after all the thawing and drainage of water, but consistent wars let to the area being under English colony control from 1700 onward. As of 2010, there is a mostly diverse population of 53,238 people. The local government follows the standard Mayor- Council system, having a standard one mayor and five councilmen. Since 2018, the mayor has been Democrat Michael A. Soriano. Company history While originally two different Swiss pharmaceutical companies up to this point, Ciba-Geigy Corp(Or Ciba-Geigy Ltd.) was founded in 1971 off of the merge of companies CIBA and Geigy. After the merge, Geigy workers moved to the CIBA headquarters in Ardsley, New York. In 1992, Ciba-Geigy was convicted of illegal waste dumping against the state of New Jersey. Superfund designation There was no state intervention other than a court case against Ciba-Geigy, the company mainly responsible. The EPA started clean up in September 1983, after the site was placed on the National Priority List(NPL). State intervention State intervention was small due to the EPA being a federal department. New Jersey did help reorganize the site in 1979 for the expansion of the Parsippany Sewage Treatment Plant, but nothing else was done except a court case which was argued on September 17 of 1991 and was decided against Ciba-Geigy with a $62 million fine. National intervention The EPA conducted many groundwater tests before putting Sharkey Landfill on the NPL on September 8, 1983. The Record of Decision(ROD) called for standard clean up procedure. Health and environmental hazards Due to the amount of time Sharkey Landfill was used as a landfill, tons of dangerous chemicals were discovered throughout the area. Large amounts of carcinogenic compounds such as benzene, chloroform, and nethylene chloride were found within the site, along with other dangerous and volatile chemicals such as toluene and dichloroethylene were also found. While most of these chemicals did not pose any major hazards to the environment, many pose large threats to the health and safety of humans. Hazard 1: toluene =Sources= One of the most abundant chemicals found at Sharkey Landfill was toluene (about 560,000 pounds), a hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C7H8. Toluene forms naturally within crude oil, and is used not only as a cleaning solution, but is also used in my other industrial products such as; medicine, wall and spray paints, paint thinner, dyes, explosives, fingernail polish, spot removers, lacquers, adhesives, rubber, detergents, antifreeze, and also in some printing and leather tanning processes. Toluene‚Äôs most abundant use is in the production of benzene, another chemical found at the site. =Human hazard= Toluene is also one of the more dangerous chemicals found at the landfill. Exposure to Toluene in even limited amounts can cause damage to the immune system, along with extreme sickness and dizziness, which can lead to things like nausea and confusion. On a more moderate to extreme scale, large amounts of exposure can cause things like liver, kidney and heart failure, along with moderate to extreme amounts of brain damage. Toluene also has the risk of damaging the fetus of a pregnant woman if she were to be exposed to the chemical. =Environmental damage= Toluene is also a Volatile Organic Compound(VOC), which gives it the added danger of creating a toxic smog if it reacts with enough sunlight and moisture in the environment. Toluene is also flammable in its liquid and gaseous state, which in high amounts can be very dangerous if the area is known for fires and/or high levels of humidity. Hazard 2: benzene =Sources= Another one of the more dangerous and abundant chemicals found at the site was 130,000 pounds of Benzene, another VOC with the chemical formula C6H6. Benzene can be produced both organically and inorganically, coming from things such as forest fires, volcanoes, and is also a natural part of crude oil. But, benzene can also come from human creations such as gasoline, diesel exhaust, and more commonly, cigarette smoke. Benzene is one of the most common chemicals used within the US, used by combining it with many other chemicals to form things such as; plastics, resins, nylon, synthetic fibers, explosives, photographic chemicals, rubber, lubricants, dyes, adhesives, coatings, paint, detergents, drugs, pesticides, printing, lithography, food processing, it has been used as a solvent, and up until the 1990s when use was greatly limited, was used as a very popular gasoline additive. =Human hazard= Benzene is the most dangerous chemical on this list, as while it does not have that many health effects, the things that it can cause are the most lethal. While small doses of benzene are of no harm, as they can be found on many everyday food items, even the shortest exposure(through breathing or eating) to high amounts of benzene can lead to extreme cases of nausea, dizziness/tiredness, and can cause damage to the central nervous system, leading to things like paralysis, coma or death. Benzene is also a known carcinogen, and can cause things like anemia, leukemia, and if in contact with eyes, can cause blindness. =Environmental damage= As for environmental damage, benzene is very similar to toluene in that it is a VOC, and can cause poisonous smog if in contact with high amounts of light and moisture, and is also a flammable liquid which is very dangerous for areas known for forest fires. Hazard 3: chloroform =Sources= Chloroform was one other chemical found in abundance on the site, with about 40,000 pounds found throughout the landfill. Chloroform is a type of cleaning solution, one of many that can be used for things such as; cleaning electronics, tools, engines, and automotive parts; dissolving oil, paint, and grease; to mix/thin paint, glue, pigments, epoxy resins, and pesticides; and to create other similar solvents or chemicals. =Human hazard= While chloroform has no known environmental hazards, large amounts of exposure to chloroform can cause alterations in the mind, such as depression and irritability. Larger amounts of exposure can cause other diseases such as Hepatitis and Jaundice. Chloroform is also anticipated to be a human carcinogen. Hazard 4: methylene chloride =Sources= Similar to chloroform, methylene chloride is a solvent, with the chemical formula CH2Cl2. It can be found in all similar compounds as chloroform but can cause a lot more damage to the body than the former. =Human hazard= Regular exposure to something such as methylene chloride can cause dangerous amounts of damage to the kidneys, liver, lungs, and if exposed long enough, the central nervous system, which can cause things like hearing loss, mental illness, and short or long-term memory loss. Even small exposure instances can cause things like irritated body parts, dizziness/nausea, drunkenness, and shortness of breath. Hazard 5: dichloroethylene About 3,000 pounds of dichloroethylene, chemical formula C2H4Cl2, were also found within the waste of Sharkey Landfill. Dichloroethylene poses no major environmental damage, but animals and humans alike can be exposed through either breathing, eating, or contact with the skin. While the amount of exposure can change the severity of the damage to death-inducing, the only known health hazard of dichloroethylene is damage to the liver and lungs within animals and humans. Clean up Initial clean up of Sharey Landfill began with a standard 5 part plan. This continued until 1993 when progress was made and so the cleaning had to not be AS severe. As of 2004, construction was no longer needed. Site sampling continues to this day. Initial clean up Standard clean up goes as follows; 1. Capping of the landfill with a clay-like membrane under a large layer of dirt to deter the movement of the waste due to rain and snow runoff and to also to promote vegetation growth. 2. The creation of vents within the membrane to ensure there is no buildup of gases such as methane. 3. Controls of surface water to specifically handle storm and rain runoff, along with controls over river erosion of the site. 4. Standard security fence placement to ensure the safety of people and animals from being harmed by the contamination. And 5. A long- term program meant to handle the monitoring of nearby groundwater to test if the cleanup process is actually working. Current status As of March 9, 2004, the EPA issued a Superfund Preliminary Site Close Out, stating no construction is needed further. Sampling still continues.

Some of their operations included stripping the chemicals off of precious metals from watch bands, photographic film, and electrical components. In 1992, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discovered that 3,000 chemicals had contaminated the soil, surface water, and groundwater. These areas were contaminated due to discharge of waste to the ground surface, the movement of waste and contamination downhill from the site building, along with surface water runoff. When the EPA investigated the site and found the chemicals in the groundwater and soil, they shut down the company that same year in 1992. In that area, the environment and people were affected, especially the workers in the facility. After a Hazard Ranking System report was conducted by the EPA, the site was placed on the National Priorities List in March 1998. In 2008, the cleanup was completed, but groundwater and wetland is still being monitored. Origins The Zschiegner Refining Company was located in Howell Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. Over 50,000 people reside in Howell Township, which is currently governed by Theresa Berger. Started in 1964 by Mr. Herbert Zschiegner, this company was a precious metal refining laboratory that operated stripping the chemicals off of precious metals. The Zschiegner Refining Company was located in a rural area that had surrounding properties and residences, as well as a stream known as Haystack Brook. Town history Howell Township is located in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. On February 23, 1801, Howell was included as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature, from parts of Shrewsbury Township. As time went on, many other townships took portions of Howell to form their own, which included Brick Township, Ocean County, Wall Township and Farmingdale. Howell currently borders townships from two counties, Monmouth County and Ocean County. These townships include Wall Township, Freehold Township and Colts Neck Township, which are located in Monmouth County; and Brick Township, Lakewood Township, and Jackson Township, that are located in Ocean County. With portions of the township being taken away in the past, Howell currently ‚Äúhas a total area of 61.209 square miles (158.530 km2), including 60.558 square miles (156.844 km2) of land and 0.651 square miles (1.686 km2) of water (1.06%),‚Äù according to the United States Census Bureau. The 2010 United States Census also states that there are 51,075 people, 17,260 households, and 13,618 families living in Howell. The current mayor of Howell Township is Theresa Berger, but the name of this township originated from Richard Howell, who served as the third Governor of New Jersey from 1794 to 1801. One interesting fact about Howell is that it is considered a ‚Äúdoughnut town,‚Äù where one town entirely wraps another town, due to the fact that it completely surrounds Farmingdale. Company history The Zschiegner Refining Company (ZRC) was founded in 1964 by Mr. Herbert Zschiegner. This precious metals refining facility is located on a 6.1-acre site in a rural residential area. There are many properties and residences that are located near the ZRC site. There are homes nearby, one being 100 feet away, two located 100 yards. All of these homes collect their water from a private well. This private well serves approximately 48,000 people, including the Zschiegner Refining Company, and is located 6.5 miles from the site. On the eastern section of the property, a stream called the Haystack Brook is located, where a pond adjacent to it, is located southeast of the property. Located west of the property is Maxim- Southard Road and the Candlewood residential development. In the surrounding area are many populated developments since it is rural. Due to the fact that the EPA found chemicals on their site, operations of this company ended in 1992. Superfund designation In October 1992, the Zschiegner Refining Company was raided by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) due to suspicions that the site were manufacturing illegal drugs. From this raid, the DEA not only discovered methamphetamine, but 3,000 different chemicals on site, which caught the attention of the EPA. State intervention On October 31, 1992, the DEA conducted a drug raid at the Zschiegner Refining Company. The DEA initially conducted this raid due to suspicions that the ZRC were manufacturing illegal drugs. Not only did the DEA find that the company was manufacturing methamphetamine, but they also found approximately 3,000 different chemicals including peroxides, cyanides, caustics, and acids improperly stored at the facility. As a result, to this discovery, owner/operator Herbert Zschiegner was arrested for the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. Being arrested was not the only punishment that Zschiegner was given. Since he was violating the Clean Water Act, he was criminally convicted on three counts in 1995. Zschiegner was also ordered to serve a 16-month prison term and had to pay $650,000 in restitution to the EPA. Due to the raid conducted on Zschiegner‚Äôs company, it caught the attention of the local and state environmental regulatory agencies. National intervention After the Zschiegner Refining Company was raided by the DEA, where approximately 3,000 different chemicals were discovered, the EPA decided to investigate the site further. On November 2, 1992, the EPA started removing all the chemicals and any materials that were contaminated. The EPA also took several samples and in 1995, the analysis of these samples showed that inorganic contaminants were found in the on-site soil and downstream surface water and sediment. In December 1997, a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) report was made, which concluded by placing the site on the National Priorities List (NPL) in March 1998. In order for a site to be considered a ‚ÄúSuperfund site,‚Äù the EPA must collect data and determine if there are any hazardous chemicals affecting the environment. The test the EPA conducts is called the HRS, which is ‚Äúa numerically based screening system that uses information from initial limited investigations to assess the relative potential of sites to pose a threat to human health or the environment.‚Äù This test was created to see if there are any potential threats on human health or the environment. If a site did meet their criteria then it is placed into the NPL, which is where we can see how the Zschiegner Refining Company site was placed. Health and environmental hazards After the DEA discovered approximately 3,000 chemicals on site, the EPA decided to investigate. This investigation was through sampling and as a result, the EPA discovered several chemicals. These chemicals were hazardous and affected the people and environment in the area that it was found in. The soil, sediments, surface water, groundwater, and the building were all contaminated with these hazardous chemicals. The people that worked at the facility were getting sick and were experiencing symptoms, such as irritation to different parts of their bodies. Etha One chemical that was initially found in the first assessment was Etha (Ethyl, Ether, or Ethyl). Etha is a colorless, liquid that can easily be evaporated. This chemical is exposed by inhaling it or can be absorbed through the skin. With just a little bit of exposure, it can cause narcotic effects such as sleepiness or giddiness, eye irritation, irritation of skin, or respiratory system. Sodium peroxide Another chemical that was found was sodium peroxide. This is a yellow, white powder that is odorless, and one can get exposed to this chemical by inhaling this powder. Another way to get exposed by this chemical is simply by contact with the skin and eyes. When exposed, some symptoms include irritation, as well as chemical burns on the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. Sodium hydroxide Sodium Hydroxide is also another chemical that was found. This chemical has no odor, but it is a white, solid. In order to be exposed, one would have to inhale it, absorb it through the skin, ingest it, or have contact with the eyes or skin. This chemical could scar the eyes, nose or throat and could cause irritation. Sodium Hydroxide could also can be very destructive to tissues. Chromic acid Adding to the list, chromic acid was also another chemical found on the site. Unlike the properties of the other chemicals, this chemical is a dark, red liquid. To be exposed to this chemical, one would have to inhale it, ingest it, absorb it through the skin, or through contact with the eyes or skin. Some symptoms that can occur through exposure include eyes and nose irritation as well as to the respiratory system. Dermatitis, or eczema, can also be a symptom that can result from exposure of Chromic Acid. Cleanup After being evaluated by the EPA, approximately 3,000 different chemicals were discovered throughout the Zschiegner Refining site. The EPA immediately ‚Äúremoved approximately 2,000 gallons of acidic solutions, 1,600 gallons of basic solutions, and 1,400 small containers of hazardous substances.‚Äù Contamination was found in the soil, sediments, surface water, groundwater, and in the building by the EPA. The site has completed its site since 2008, yet groundwater and wetland is still being monitored. Initial cleanup November 2, 1992 was when the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) made an evaluation of Zschiegner Refining. After the evaluation, ‚Äúa verbal authorization of funds was approved at this time to remove dangers present on the Zschiegner Refining Site. The Technical Assistance Team (TAT) conducted a site assessment on November 4, 1992. The work to be conducted at Zschiegner Refining is to stabilize, treat and remove all hazardous materials, drums and laboratory chemicals contained at Zschiegner Refining.‚Äù It was the EPA‚Äôs mission to try to get rid of all the hazardous chemicals that was found on the site and they wanted to do so as quick as possible. Due to their findings, the EPA transferred contaminated materials to new containers, soil and liquid were taken to be sampled and explosive items were detonated. In March 1993, the removal action started and the chemical wastes were taken away. Inorganic contaminants were found in soil, surface water and sediment from sampling in 1995. In July 1998, no contaminants were discovered as the EPA tested the private well water downstream from the site for organic and inorganic contaminants. The EPA selected a remedy in the site‚Äôs September 2004 Record of Decision, or ROD, and called for ‚Äúexcavation of contaminated surface and subsurface soil; excavation of contaminated sediment from the wetland and a small portion of the brook next to the site; transportation of contaminated soil and sediment off site for disposal, with treatment if necessary; demolition of the on-site building to allow for excavation of contaminated soil beneath it; and groundwater monitoring.‚Äù These orders ultimately led to the current status of the Zschiegner Refining site. Current status The cleanup for the Zschiegner Refining site has been completed since 2008. In February 2007, the company‚Äôs building was demolished and discarded from the site. As the EPA were cleaning this site, ‚Äúa total of 10,425 cubic yards of contaminated upland soil and 15,351 cubic yards of contaminated wetland soil was excavated and disposed of.‚Äù This amount of contamination demonstrates how hazardous the Zschiegner Refining Company was to its surroundings. Although all the chemicals have been removed, the groundwater and wetland is still being monitored in order to make sure that it is safe for the people and the environment.

The groundwater in the public wells are contaminated with the hazardous chemicals of Trichloroethylene (TCE), Dichloroethene (DCE), Tetrachloroethylene (Perchloroethene), 1,1-Dichloroethene (1,1-DCE), and 1,2-Dichloroethene (1,2-DCE). These chemicals pose a huge risk to the towns nearby population, as the wells are a source of public drinking water. In March 2012, the site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund site list.  Origins  This site was originally several public wells filled with groundwater that gave public drinking water to the town of West Orange, New Jersey, and Orange, New Jersey, in Essex County.  Town History  West Orange is a town in Essex County, New Jersey, and is surrounded by the towns of Orange, Montclair, Maplewood, East Orange, Bloomfield, South Orange, Cedar Grove, Livingston, West Caldwell, Millburn, and several others. The town had a mayor-council system of municipal government and, as of 2016, the mayor is Robert Parisi. On Wikipedia, the town population is recorded as ‚Äú47,249 as of 2016‚Äù and has a ‚Äú2.3% population increase since the 2010 census.‚Äù The town was originally ‚Äúa smaller town of Fairmont in 1862 and wasn‚Äôt called ‚ÄúWest Orange‚Äù until 1863. The town has over 200 years of history before the American Revolution, which led to the founding of the town.‚Äù According to The Township of West Orange website, ‚ÄúThe residents of West Orange today make up a diverse population with a proud community heritage.‚Äù  Company History  In the case of the Orange Valley Regional Groundwater site, the EPA was unable to find the company responsible for the contamination of the site. The EPA is continuing to look for the source of the toxic chemicals, but there has been no progress made so far. Finding the source of the toxic chemicals, in this case, has been very difficult for the EPA. The possible reason why it is so difficult for the EPA to find the company responsible is because the company that caused the toxic waste to contaminate the wells may no longer be in business. Also, many industrial businesses in West Orange likely use the chemicals that were found in the well water. This included many even more industrial businesses in the past, too, when toxic waste was not regulated.  Superfund Designation  The site was proposed to be added to the NPL of the EPA's Superfund site list on March 15, 2012, and was officially added on September 18, 2012. The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) reviewed the environmental data obtained from the site and evaluated potential human exposure to contaminants. This was to determine whether the exposures were of concern to public health. They found that the site was contaminated with the toxic chemicals of Tetrachloroethene (PCE), Trichloroethylene (TCE), 1,1-Dichloroethene (1,1-DCE), and 1,2-Dichloroethene (1,2-DCE). The NJDOH and ATSDR concluded that the public was at risk for higher cancer rates than other areas because of contaminated groundwater.  State Intervention  The Orange Water Department originally installed a treatment system for the wells, hoping to remove the contaminants and provide the community with safe drinking water. The water from those wells was monitored regularly. The regular monitoring ensured that the treatment system was effective and the people's health was protected. The former Brook Lane public supply well, located between the Orange Park and Gist Place wells, was also taken out of service to protect the public from the contamination. In the article EPA Proposes to Add an Area of Orange and West Orange, N.J. to the Superfund List; Protecting Drinking Water EPA Priority, ‚ÄúIn 2011, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection asked EPA to consider the Orange Valley Regional Ground Water site for inclusion on the federal Superfund list.‚Äù  National Intervention  The Preliminary Assessment, or site investigation, was completed on September 30, 1992. In June 2009, the EPA collected groundwater samples from public water supply wells for the site investigation. The site was proposed to be added to the NPL on March 15, 2012, and finalized on September 18, 2012. As of today, a remedy plan has not been selected, remedial action has not begun started, remedy construction has neither been completed nor deleted from the NPL, has not had a five-year review, and there is no plan for reuse and redevelopment of the site.  Health & Environmental Hazards  The chemicals found at the site were Trichloroethene (TCE), Tetrachloroethene (Perchloroethene), Dichloroethene (DCE), 1,1-Dichloroethene (1,1-DCE), and 1,2-Dichloroethene (1,2-DCE). The side effects of exposure to these substances in the human body are a higher risk of cancers, including kidney and liver cancer and tumors. The health hazards of these chemicals have caused the contaminated wells of Orange Park, Gist Place, and Brook Lanes to be shut down.  Damage/Hazard 1  Trichloroethene, or Trichloroethylene, which is also abbreviated to TCE, is one chemical found in the contaminated groundwater. The chemical, which was listed on the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's Glossary of Environment Cleanup Terms, is defined by the EPA as ‚Äúa colorless, man-made liquid used primarily as a solvent for removing grease from metal.‚Äù Studies conducted by the EPA in 2011 show that TCE causes kidney cancer and may also cause liver cancer and non- Hodgkin lymphoma. The EPA's mechanistic analyses supports a mutagenicity in TCE-induced kidney carcinogenicity. Exposure to the toxin can result in autoimmune diseases and hypersensitivity. TCE can also play a role in developmental cardiac toxicity. In the document Human Health Effects of Trichloroethylene: Key Findings and Scientific Issues, it is stated that ‚ÄúTCE is carcinogenic to humans by all routes of exposure and poses a potential human health hazard for noncancer toxicity to the central nervous system, kidney, liver, immune system, male reproductive system, and the developing embryo/fetus.‚Äù  Damage/Hazard 2  Tetrachloroethene, or Perchloroethene, also called PCE, is a chemical solvent used as a dry cleaning agent and a degreaser. On the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's website, in its Glossary of Environmental Cleanup Terms, the chemical is described as being ‚Äúa clear, colorless, nonflammable liquid with a characteristic odor.‚Äù The main types of exposure are through inhalation of the vapor, which can come from contaminated soil or water, and ingestion of contaminated water. Chronic exposure to the chemical has been shown to cause vision deficiencies. The toxicity of the chemical is recorded as being ‚Äúmoderate to low,‚Äù but there are some severe health risks. Being a Group 2A carcinogen makes it possibly dangerous to humans. It is also a known central nervous system depressant and can dissolves fats from the skin, causing skin irritation. There is the increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease, too. Also, PCE has been shown to cause liver tumors and kidney tumors. When heated at temperatures over 315 ¬∞C (599 ¬∞F), it can be oxidized into phosgene, an extremely poisonous gas.  Damage/Hazard 3  Dichloroethene, or DCE, are ‚Äúchemicals with similar molecular structures used to make specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals.‚Äù DCE chemicals are used as degradation products of trichloroethene, making them found mostly at hazardous waste sites like the Orange Valley Regional Groundwater site. There are two different types of DCE, known as 1,1-Dichloroethene, or 1,1-DCE, and 1,2-Dichloroethene, or 1,2-DCE. These chemicals have ‚Äúsimilar molecular structures used to produce a variety of consumer and industrial products, such as specialty chemicals and cleaning products.‚Äù DCE, 1,1-DCE, and 1,2-DCE exposure can be through ingestion, inhalation, skin contact, and eye contact. DCE targets the skin, liver, kidneys, lungs, and central nervous system, in which exposure can result in irritation of the skin, liver damage, kidney damage, lung damage, and central nervous system depression.  Cleanup  In the early 1980s, when the contamination was first discovered, the Orange Water Department installed treatment systems, like filtration systems, and heavily monitored the water. In June or July 2009, the EPA collected samples from the sites public wells and found toxic chemicals in the water supply. The wells were shut down and the EPA began to propose that it become a Superfund site on the NPL. Today, the wells are still out of use and the EPA, along with the state legislature and the Orange Water Department, are continuing to monitor the water supply after installing a new filtration system.  Initial Cleanup  Originally, when the contamination was discovered in the early 1980s, the Orange Water Department installed treatment systems to remove the toxins from the contaminated groundwater and monitored the water quality and treatment system effectiveness regularly. When investigating an industrial facility in West Orange, New Jersey in June‚ÄìJuly 2009, the EPA collected untreated groundwater samples from three public supply wells of Gist Place, Orange Park, Brook Alley, and Well 6, within the Orange Water Department supply system. When the results showed toxic industrial chemicals in the wells Orange Water Department closed down the contaminated wells. They then contacted the EPA and proposed the site being added to the Superfund site list and the NPL.  Current Status  The wells on the site are currently unused. The water in the wells are continuously monitored and a new filtration system has been installed to treat the water. The EPA has not selected a remedy for the site, no remedial action has been started, remedy construction has not been completed, and no plan for reuse and redevelopment of the site has been proposed. Several Performance measures have insufficient data or not been performed. This includes human exposure being under control, control of groundwater migration, completion of construction, and readiness for the site to be anticipated use. There is insufficient data for control of human exposure, meaning that due to uncertainty regarding exposures, one cannot draw conclusions as to whether human exposures are controlled, typically because response to the contamination has not begun or the response has begun, but it has not yet generated information sufficiently reliable to evaluate whether there are currently any unacceptable human exposure pathways at the site. There is insufficient data for groundwater migration control, meaning that due to uncertainty regarding contaminated groundwater migration, EPA cannot draw conclusions as to whether the migration of contaminated groundwater is stabilized. No for construction completion means either physical construction is not complete or actions are still needed to address contamination. There is no anticipation of the site to be in use, meaning that one or more of these criteria above has not been met, or the site may still have redevelopment occurring on portions of the site and may be eligible for additional redevelopment.

This in turn led to an appointment in the Italian hospital of Queen's Square; later he moved to the house of the Congregation of Our Lady of Sion in Bayswater, and was canonically released from the Benedictines to join the clergy of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster. His works are judged variously by scholars, though they are considered useful still because of their wealth of primary material.

It runs Peterborough City Hospital, Stamford and Rutland Hospital and Hinchingbrooke Hospital. It is one of six centres used by the Defence Medical Services. History Established in 1993, Peterborough Hospitals NHS Trust originally comprised two hospitals, Peterborough District Hospital and Edith Cavell Hospital. In 2002 Stamford and Rutland Hospital in Lincolnshire joined the trust. In 2006 Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was rated one of the country's top performing NHS acute trustsThe annual health check: assessing and rating the NHS (pp.22, 34 & 69) Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection, October 2006 and, in 2004, it became one of the first ten NHS foundation trusts in England. The new hospital in Peterborough was financed through the Private Finance Initiative and has led the Trust into acute financial difficulties. It has an underlying deficit of ¬£37 million a year on a turnover of ¬£222 million. It is unclear how its financial problems can be resolved. In July 2016 the trust announced that it needed ¬£650m of central financial support over the next 26 years to finance the ¬£1.8 billion contract. A redevelopment programme for Stamford Hospital was approved in October 2013. In January 2014 it was reported that Circle Health could table a rescue bid for the Trust involving partnering it with nearby Hinchingbrooke Hospital. The bid never materialised, but in July 2016 it was announced that the two trusts were planning to merge in 2017. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter.

Function microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop.

An explorer of the Don Host Oblast and an envoy of Peter I Rigelman referred to the village as being established in 1647. After the victory of Tsar Ivan the Terrible over the Kazan Khanate, where the Cossacks played a key role, he granted them Don lands. These territories were rich in fisheries, with agriculture, viticulture, and trade also being developed rapidly. In 1690, on the recommendation of Peter I, the Cossacks decided to move their settlement upstream along the Don. Yet at its present place the stanitsa of Kazanskaya was settled only in 1740.

Richard Croftes by Joshua Reynolds Croftes was the eldest son of William Croftes of West Harling Norfolk and Little Saxham Suffolk and his wife Mary Decker, daughter of Sir Matthew Decker, 1st Baronet MP and a London merchant. He was educated at Eton College from 1753 to 1758, was admitted at St John's College, Cambridge. on 3 July 1758, and graduated MA (Litt) in 1761. In 1760 Croftes's parents began trying to arrange a seat for him in Parliament. He was on the Duke of Newcastle‚Äôs \\"list of persons to be brought into Parliament\\" on 9 June 1760, having been mentioned to him by the Duke of Grafton, at the request of Mr Croftes, and by Mr Page at the request of Mrs Croftes. William Croftes was willing to pay for a seat but, found Newcastle's suggestion of Sudbury unattractive because \\"it would be expensive and the success doubtful\\". Mrs Croftes wrote to Newcastle on 15 February 1761 that her husband \\"was willing to have parted with a large sum of money\\" to have his son returned, and she herself was greatly disappointed that nothing had been arranged: ‚ÄúWhat objections can your Grace have to serve my son? he is a worthy young man of great application, of good family, and likely to have a good fortune; I flatter myself my son‚Äôs behaviour will be such that you will not repent ... bringing him into Parliament.‚Äù So in Newcastle's list of people to be brought in, he then appeared as ‚ÄúMr. Croftes, somewhere with great expense‚Äù. Croftes's father asked on 9 March 1761 that he should be brought in for Newark, but this was turned down. It was not until 1767 that a seat was found for Croftes on Grafton's recommendation. He was returned unopposed as a member of parliament for Petersfield in a by-election on 17 December 1767. At the 1768 general election he transferred to Downton, where he was again returned unopposed. His father died in 1770, and Croftes succeeded to his estates. In 1771, Grafton, now Chancellor of Cambridge University, suggested that Croftes stand for one of the Cambridge University seats, but the nomination was not well received in the University. The Bishop of Lincoln wrote to Lord Hardwicke on 5 February 1771 \\"sending down so young a man, and so little known, has given much offence\\". Richard Watson, regius professor of divinity, wrote to Grafton that the university was dissatisfied with Croftes. \\"We have no particular objections to him as a private man; nay we believe him equal to transacting the business of Downton, but we by no means think him of consequence enough in life to be the representative, or of ability sufficient to support the interest, of the University of Cambridge\\". Nevertheless, in January 1771 Croftes vacated his seat at Downton to stand for the University in a by-election on 4 February 1771. Although an independent section of the university put up their own candidate, Croftes was returned by 76 votes against 45. In the 1774 general election, he held one of the Cambridge University seats unopposed. However, he was defeated at the 1780 general election and did not stand for Parliament again. There is no record of his having spoken in the House of Commons. Croftes died aged 43 on 4 July 1783 and was buried at West Harling. He had married Harriet Darell, daughter of John Darell on 11 February 1773. They had one daughter.

At least 20 people, including two policemen, were killed and more than 30 others injured in the suicide attack. Background The shrine was previously targeted by terrorists more than a decade ago on 19 March 2005. At least 35 people were killed, including both Shia and Sunni devotees, and several injured when a suicide bomber targeted the shrine of Pir Rakhel Shah in 2005. It was the second deadliest attack on a shrine in Pakistan in 2017. Previously in February 2017, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Sehwan that targeted the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, killing at least 90 people. Bombing In the evening of 5 October 2017, a suicide bomber targeted the Sufi shrine of Pir Rakhel Shah situated in Fatehpur, a small town in Gandawah tehsil of Jhal Magsi district in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province. Balochistan government spokesperson, Anwar ul Haq Kakar confirmed that the blast was a suicide attack. According to Balochistan's Home Secretary Akbar Harifal, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, after he was intercepted by on-duty police guards outside the shrine. According to him, 18 people including three children and two policemen were killed; and at least 27 others injured, fourteen of them seriously. Balochistan's Home Minister Sarfraz Bugti also confirmed the death toll. Deputy Commissioner Asadullah Kakar said that, the attack took place \\"at a time when it was packed with people, attending anniversary celebrations of Syed Cheesal Shah\\". In terms of attendance, thursdays are usually busy at shrines as the day is considered spiritually significant. The explosion took place when the dhamaal was being performed after Isha prayers. According to Reuters, militant group ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack via its Amaq News Agency.

History Cakung and the other two nearby rivers: Jatikramat dan Buaran, flow from Bekasi and interconnect until draining into the Jakarta Bay in the district of Marunda through Cakung Drain and currently through Banjir Kanal Timur. In the past, the three rivers supplied water for drinking and agriculture in the area.Tiga Sungai Menghidupkan Timur Jakarta, Kompas.com - 28 Mei 2016. Some leftover rice fields can still be seen in Cipinang Melayu, District of Makasar, and District of Cakung. In 1990, more people occupied Pulogebang and the rice fields were transformed into houses. Since then, Cakung river often overflows during the rain season and causes high floods. A research by Pieter J Kunu and H Lelolterry of the Pattimura University, Ambon, showed that the development of the city changed 85% land of Jakarta to be waterproof, unable to absorb surface water and resulted in regular floods. One of the solutions was by constructing a flood-control canal, Banjir Kanal Timur. The flow of Cakung, Buaran, Jati Kramat, Sunter, and Cipinang rivers was cut to drain into the canal, and thereby reducing the occurrence of flood. After the old Cakung river flow in Pulogebang was cut by the flood-control canal, Banjir Kanal Timur, in the old maps there was still a small stream flowing away from the canal, identified as Cakung river. However, in reality this stream resembles a street gutter with a width of 1 meter, flowing out starting about 300 meter from the bank of Kanal Timur. The flow of this new Cakung widens a few hundred meters to the north, as can be seen in Rawa Kuning Street, Ujung Menteng, District of Cakung, East Jakarta, reaching a width of 3 meter. Currently, the old river flowing to Banjir Kanal Timur has a function as drainage from the industrial and household waste. It badly affect the river quality, resulting darkened water and unpleasant smell.Kanal Timur yang Mengubah Alur Sungai. Kompas.com - 24 Mei 2016.Kesadaran Menjaga Sungai yang Semakin Runtuh.

His work focuses on bioarchaeology, the study of human remains from archaeological settings. Although his interests span the entire record of human evolution, his research largely pertains to the last 10,000 years, a period of dynamic change in health, well- being, and lifestyle, much of which relates to population increase, overcrowding, and nutritional decline that co-occurred with the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture, creating living conditions that humans are grappling with to the present day.  Early life and education  Larsen was born in Omaha, Nebraska, the middle child of five children, including two older sisters and two younger sisters. He spent most of his childhood in Beatrice, Nebraska, graduating from high school in 1970. His exposure to artifacts and exhibits at the Homestead National Monument‚Äôs museum near his home town initiated his fascination with all matters ancient. Within weeks of high school graduation, Larsen spent his first archaeological field season on a Nebraska State Historical Society excavation of Fort Atkinson, the first military fort west of the Missouri River. The discovery of human bone fragments at the site that summer captured his interest in the study of archaeological human remains. Larsen attended Kansas State University (BA, Anthropology, 1974), where he studied with archaeologist Patricia J. O‚ÄôBrien and physical anthropologists William M. Bass III and Michael Finnegan. Following his freshman and sophomore years, he worked with Smithsonian Institution physical anthropologists, Douglas H. Ubelaker and T. Dale Stewart, on field projects in South Dakota (1971) and Maryland (1972) and subsequently with American Museum of Natural History archaeologist David Hurst Thomas in Nevada (1973, 1974). He completed his graduate education at the University of Michigan (MA, Anthropology, 1975; PhD, Biological Anthropology, 1980), studying with Milford H. Wolpoff (advisor), C. Loring Brace, David S. Carlson, Frank B. Livingstone, and Stanley M. Garn.  Career  Soon after entering the graduate program at Michigan, he began working with David Hurst Thomas on St. Catherines Island, Georgia, a project that lead to Larsen's Ph.D. dissertation research on the bioarchaeology of the Georgia coast, documenting the health and lifestyle impacts of the introduction of agriculture and its intensification in later prehistory on native populations. His long-term research program in the American Southeast has been called ‚Äú‚Ä¶the most comprehensive data for all of North America.‚Äù This research program is part of a decades-long (1975- ) collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History involving the study of health, dietary, and economic changes prior to and after the arrival of Europeans and the establishment of the mission system in Spanish Florida. He has served as a Research Associate with the American Museum since 1980. Larsen has played a lead role in the study of ancient human remains in other regions of North America (Great Basin, Nevada), at √áatalh√∂y√ºk (Turkey) (cite Wiki), and Badia Pozzeveri (Tuscany, Italy). He is co-director of the European History of Health Project, tracking health and lifestyle history based on human remains from across Europe over the last 5,000 years with an international collaboration of bioarchaeologists, archaeologists, economic historians, climatologists, and geologists. Larsen began his professional teaching and research career at the University of Massachusetts, North Dartmouth campus (1979-1983), subsequently moving to Northern Illinois University (1983-1989; chair, 1987-1989), Purdue University (1989-1993), and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (1993-2001). He spent a term (Spring, 1999) at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught bioarchaeology. He was Adjunct Professor in Evolutionary Anthropology, Duke University (1995-2001). He moved to Ohio State University (2001- ), where he was recruited to chair the Department of Anthropology. Over the course of his tenure as chair (2001-2017), he led the transformation of the department from an unknown unit into a leading program in science-based anthropology, adding nine faculty positions, expanding laboratory facilities, and attracting top students to its undergraduate and graduate programs. Larsen has played a leadership role in professional societies and in publishing, serving as Vice President (1996-1998) and President (1999-2001) of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, Chair of the Anthropology section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2010-2011), Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Physical Anthropology (2001-2007), and founding editor of the book series, Bioarchaeologial Interpretations of the Human Past, for the University Press of Florida (2006- ). Larsen is a member of professional societies, including the National Academy of Sciences, American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, and the Society for American Archaeology.  Honors  Larsen has published 35 books and monographs and over 200 articles and contributions to books. His textbook, Our Origins: Discovering Physical Anthropology (W. W. Norton), is a leading introductory textbook, and Bioarchaeology: Interpreting Behavior from the Human Skeleton (Cambridge University Press), the first major synthesis of the field of bioarchaeology. * 1978-79 Pre-Doctoral Fellowship, Division of Physical Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution * 1984 Elected Member, Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society * 1990 Gary Shapiro Memorial Distinguished Lecturer, Museum of Florida History, Tallahassee * 1999 Amos Hawley Distinguished Term Professor, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill * 2000 Marshall Urist Lecturer, Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons * 2001 Distinguished Professor of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Ohio State University * 2002 Charles P.

He was named for Sunlun village, which is near Myingyan, middle Burma.Kornfield, 1996, chapter 6. U Kyaw Din was a farmer who took up the practice of anapanasati (in-out breath) meditation on his own, with little instruction other than discussing it with two local friends.Kornfield, 1996, chapter 6. He practiced seriously and strenuously on his own and attained the first three stages of enlightenment 1920 before joining a monastery and becoming an arahat.Kornfield, 1996, chapter 6. Even though he was barely literate, he became a popular meditation teacher among the monks. There are currently several monasteries teaching Sunlun style practice in Burma such as the Sunlun Monastery of S. Okkalapa.Kornfield, 1996, chapter 6. Sunlun Sayadaw taught an intense form of meditation which is done for a period of over 2 hours. The first 45 minutes includes strong, rapid and vigorous breathing, focusing on the sensation in the nose or upper lip. After this initial period, the meditators are to attend to mindfulness of sensations (vedana), especially any bodily pains, continuing without any movement for the rest of the 2 to 3 hour period.Kornfield, 1996, chapter 6.Harvey, Peter.

She grew up in an Italian neighborhood of South Philadelphia, where she attended public schools. Her grandparents, who lived with the family, spoke the Abruzzese dialect; Cavallo learned Italian from them, and later based two characters in her first novel on them. As a teenager, she moved with her family to Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. She attended the University of Pennsylvania and spent time in Florence, Italy, as a Fulbright scholar. She was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society.  Career  After graduation, Cavallo worked for a year at the Philadelphia State Hospital as a psychiatric social worker; this experience provided the background for her first novel, A Bridge of Leaves (1961). Written in New Hampshire on a MacDowell Colony fellowship, the novel depicts a young man's rite of passage to adulthood. She published a nonfiction book, The Lower East Side: A Portrait in Time, in 1971. Her short stories and other writings have appeared in a variety of journals and anthologies, including Helen Barolini's The Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian American Women (1985).

He raced only as a two-year-old in 2012 when he won two of his five races including the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes. He was retired from racing in 2013 and became a breeding stallion in France. Background Pedro the Great is a bay horse bred in Kentucky by Anthony Oppenheimer's Hascombe Stud. In 2011 he was sent to Englnad and put up for the auction at the Tattersalls October Yearling Sale where he was bought for 150,000 guineas by John Magnier of the Coolmore Stud. During his racing career he was trained by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses the details of his ownership changed from race to race: he sometimes raced in the colours of Michael Tabor while on other occasions he was described as being owned by a partnership of Tabor, Susan Magnier and Derrick Smith. He was sired by Henrythenavigator who won the 2000 Guineas, Irish 2000 Guineas, St James's Palace Stakes and Sussex Stakes in 2008. As a breeding stallion he was not a conspicuous success and was eventually exported to Russia, but he did sire several other good winners including George Vancouver (Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf) and Sudirman. Pedro the Great's dam Glatisant was a high-class racemare who won the Prestige Stakes in 1993. She was even better as a broodmare, producing the 2000 Guineas winner Footstepsinthesand and being the female-line ancestor of Power and Rivet. Racing career 2012: two-year-old season Rather than making his debut in a maiden race, Pedro the Great began his track career in the Listed Rochestown Stakes over six furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 4 June. Ridden by his trainer's son Joseph, he started at odds of 8/1 and finished fifth of the six runners behind Dawn Approach. On 21 June he was dropped back in class and started favourite for a maiden at Leopardstown in which he was partnered by Seamie Heffernan. He led from the start and drew away from his five opponents in the final furlong to win by four and a quarter lengths from the Jim Bolger-trained Wexford Opera. Nine days after his win at Leopardstown the colt was moved up to Group 3 class for the Railway Stakes at the Curragh and started second favourite behind his stablemate Cristoforo Colombo. After racing in second place for most of the way he faded in the closing stages and finished fifth behind the David Wachman-trained Probably. The Group 1 Phoenix Stakes at Leopardstown on 12 August attracted a field of six runners and Pedro the Great, with Heffernan in the saddle, started the 10/1 fourth choice in the betting. Probably started favourite ahead of Cristoforo Colombo and the British challenger Bungle Inthejungle (Molecomb Stakes) while the other two runners were Leitir Mor and the filly Lottie Dod. The horses raced up the stands side (the left hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint) with Pedro the Great settling in fifth before switching to the right and taking the lead in the last quarter mile. The complexion of the race changed abruptly a furlong out when Cristoforo Colombo, who was going well and still in contention, slipped and fell a furlong out. In the closing stages Pedro the Great drew away from his remaining rivals and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and three quarter lengths from Leitir Mor. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"He won his maiden very impressively. He was a bit fresh the last day and we decided to take our time with him today and he settled well. He won‚Äôt mind stepping up to seven furlongs\\". In October Pedro the Great was sent to France to contest the Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and started 9/2 third favourite. After being restrained by Joseph O'Brien in the early stages he made some progress approaching the last 400 metres but never looked likely to threaten the leaders and finished fifth to Olympic Glory. Stud record Pedro the Great remained in training as a three-year-old but did not race again: his retirement was announced in November 2013. He began his stud career at the Haras de La Haie Neuve in Britanny. Died on 9 August 2019.

Studies Petr Je≈æek studied Economics of International Trade at the University of Economics, Prague, completing his education in 1987. Diplomacy From 1989 he worked in a number of diplomatic and public service roles within the Czech government, related mainly to the Czech Republic's accession to the EU. In 1992 he was a volunteer at the EU Monitor Mission in the war conflict in the former Yugoslavia. In 1993 he was posted to the Czech Embassy in Copenhagen to cover the Danish EU Council Presidency dealing also with the block¬¥s Eastern enlargement. Upon his return to Prague he participated in establishment of the EU Department at the Foreign Ministry and as head of its unit and later European Correspondent he took part in deepening of the structural political dialogue between EU and its CEE associated countries. In the period of key negotiations and decisions on launching talks on EU enlargement and shaping EU future, between 1996 and 1999, he worked at the Czech Mission to the EU in Brussels as Political Counsellor, then Head of Political Department and Deputy Ambassador. In 1999-2001 he was back in Prague at the Foreign Office as Director of the Department for Political Relations with EU and then at the expanded Department for Western Europe and EU where bilateral and EU relations were dealt with. In 2001 he was appointed Director-General of the European Integration Section which was the centre and coordinating body for European affairs in the Czech Republic. It was in charge of EU accession preparations, negotiations and also of the government communication campaign before the referendum on EU membership. He was also Deputy to the State Secretary for European Affairs and Deputy Chair of the key inter-ministerial Committee for European Integration. Office of the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic In 2003-2004 he worked at the Office of the Czech Government as (politically independent civil servant) Director of the Prime Minister's Departments and Offices for Vladim√≠r ≈†pidla. Private Sector From 2005-2013 he was a partner in BXL Consulting which he co- established - a successful private company dealing with European affairs and representing multinationals, other foreign and Czech companies but also the Cuban opposition, for example. Politics In 2013 he and his former ministry colleague, partner in the firm and also the first Czech EU Commissioner Pavel Teliƒçka started to support the ANO protest political movement which wanted to change the miserable state of Czech politics. In those days the ANO movement polled around 1%. Their firm was dissolved in order to avoid possible conflict of interests and in 2014 they wrote the ANO manifesto and led the ANO candidacy list for the European Parliament elections which ANO won despite a very low turnout. When in January 2018 ANO supported the candidacy of Milo≈° Zeman for the Czech President, Petr Je≈æek announced that he terminated his cooperation with the ANO movement, which became by far the strongest political subject in the Czech Republic, as he increasingly disapproved what he saw as the significant change of course and behaviour of ANO. In February 2019, shortly before EP elections he co-established Hlas (Voice) movement and was number two on its candidate list. The movement gained 2,38% of votes and although it was the most out of parties not represented in the Czech Parliament it was below the necessary threshold to gain seats in the European Parliament. Member of the European Parliament In 2014 Petr Je≈æek and his three colleagues joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) in the European Parliament. He worked in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) where he was also ALDE Deputy Coordinator, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and in another five committees including the Special Committee on Terrorism (he was also ALDE rapporteur for the anti-terrorist directive). He was one of two rapporteurs for the Committee of Inquiry to investigate alleged contraventions and maladministration in the application of Union law in relation to money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion, created after Panama Papers revelations. Later he was elected chair of the Special Committee on Financial Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance (TAX3). He chaired its meetings including 34 public hearings with ministers, commissioners, experts, financial institutions directors and other representatives, company representatives including Google, Facebook, Nike and McDonald¬¥s, and other participants. He also presided over meetings of coordinators of EP political groups which decided the programme of the committee activities. He led the committee missions (to US, Isle of Man, Latvia, Estonia and Denmark). For five years he chaired the EP Delegation for Relations with Japan. In this capacity he chaired the Inter-parliamentary EU-Japan Committee and led talks of the EP Delegation with Japanese law makers, Members of the Government and representatives of industry and trade and civil society. He chaired regular meetings of the EP Delegation. Petr Je≈æek was Parliament‚Äôs rapporteur for two reports (one of which was legislative) and ALDE rapporteur for 30 reports (24 of which were legislative). As Parliament rapporteur he worked and negotiated 13 opinions. As ALDE rapporteur he dealt with 39 opinions. He took part, as Parliament or ALDE rapporteur, in 75 final negotiations between EU institutions on final texts of regulations or directives (so-called trialogues) he worked on.

Baldwyn was the son of Charles Baldwyn of Bockleton and his wife Elizabeth Allgood, daughter of John Allgood of Newcastle upon Tyne and was baptized on 29 September 1729. He matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford in 1747. In April 1751 his father died and he succeeded to the estates. He married Catherine Childe, daughter of William Lacon Childe, MP for Shropshire on 14 May 1752. The Baldwyns were old Shropshire gentry and several generations of the family had sat in Parliament for Ludlow. Baldwyn was elected Member of Parliament for Shropshire in an by-election on 8 May 1766 which was uncontested after a threat of Whig opposition. He was the choice of the Shropshire Tories and of Lord Powis, a ministerialist by preference under George II and George III. Baldwyn was re-elected unopposed in 1768 and 1774. In 1779, at the end of his parliamentary career, The Public Ledger published a character sketch of him as ‚ÄòA puzzle-headed country gentleman, of Tory principles. Votes constantly with the minister, and avers that Kings and Governments, let their actions be what they will, must and ought to be supported. The extent of his compliance with Governments is somewhat exaggerated On matters about which the country gentlemen felt strongly, Baldwyn would go against the Government. Less than a dozen speeches by him are recorded during his 14 years in Parliament. Baldwyn did not stand in 1780 by which time his financial position was precarious. He received a secret service pension but it is uncertain how long he had it but payments are mentioned between March 1779 and July 1780. On 27 Aug. 1782 Baldwyn wrote to Shelburne, then First Lord of the Treasury: He enclosed a printed leaflet of three pages, Case of Charles Baldwyn, Esq. He claimed to have ruined himself for the sake of his eldest son, who now refused to come to his financial rescue. The story is unconvincing: it is one of bad bargains with every member of the family he had to deal with; and while denying that he had gambled, he admits having speculated: he purchased ‚Äòestates when land sold very dear‚Äô; borrowed money ‚Äòthe interest whereof is since raised‚Äô; and afterwards was ‚Äòunder a necessity of selling estates very cheap‚Äô. Still, he claims that, while he ‚Äòimpaired his finances [...] he has served his son to whose welfare indeed he had in a great measure sacrificed his own fortune, his liberty, all the comforts of life, and perhaps his life itself, for as he finds his health much injured, he doubts not but his existence will be shortened by his uneasiness of mind.‚Äô Baldwyn died on 28 September 1801.

From the age of ten he was a shepherd in the land of Arles in winter and of Luberon in summer. He spent his military service in Africa, spending five years in the Sahel. He learned to read during this period. After completing his service Bonnet returned to Bellegarde. Bonnet was recalled to the army in July 1870 at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, fought at Ch√¢tillon and was wounded at Champigny. He remained in Paris after the war. He married Marie C√©leste L'Huillier. Bonnet was taught French by his fellow-Proven√ßal Duc-Quercy, and said later Duc-Quercy \\"looked like a small black bull breathing fire from mouth and nostrils. His first writings appeared in the Viro Souleu in Paris, where they were noticed by Fr√©d√©ric Mistral and Alphonse Daudet. Daudet wrote to him several times inviting him to meet in Paris, but it took six months before Bonnet could buy a frock coat and waistcoat for the visit. In 1877 the Soucieta Felibrenco d√© Paris was founded by Bonnet, Jean Barnab√© Amy, Joseph Banquier, Antoine Duc (Duc-Quercy), Maurice Faure, Louis Gleize and Pierre Grivolas. The society created the journal Lou Viro-Soul√©u. Bonnet wrote in Proven√ßal and Daudet translated his work. Daudet's translation of Vido d'enfant appeared in 1894 and was well received, including a good review by Georges Clemenceau in the D√©p√™che. At that time he was working as a gardener in Paris. Bonnet was a member of the F√©librige in 1897, a literary and cultural association founded by Mistral and other Proven√ßal writers to defend and promote the Proven√ßal or langue d'oc language and literature. Bonnet had started to work on Varlet de mas when his wife died in November 1897, and Daudet died a month later. Daudet's son L√©on Daudet wrote the preface to Varlet de Mas in 1898. Bonnet returned to Bellegarde in 1907, after 36 years in Paris. He created a local magazine, le Midi et le Nord. He lived in Bellegarde for five years, in Bouillargues for five years, then in 1917 settled in N√Æmes, where he lived in poverty for the rest of his life. He died in N√Æmes in 5 April 1925. A square and a primary school in Bellegarde are named in his memory.

Her main goals were to be an ‚Äúadvocate of correct principles of physical development and dress for women.‚Äù She also wanted to educate mass groups of men and women about the importance of hygiene and health to prevent the spread of diseases. As a lecturer, she spoke about human rights, arguing for equality.  Ancestry  Miller's father was Solomon Jenness and her mother was Susan Wendell Jenness, both New England natives. She was also descended from the family of Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr, and Wendell Phillips. Early life Miller was born in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in 1859. Although she was born in New Hampshire, she moved to Boston and stayed there until she married Conrad Miller in 1884. Before she was married, she was known in Boston as a ‚ÄúWomen in Letters\\".\\"Miller, Annie Jenness (b. 1859) .\\" Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia . . Retrieved December 04, 2019 from Encyclopedia.com: https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and- maps/miller-annie-jenness-b-1859 Being known as a Women in Letters was a prestigious title in Boston, Massachusetts. This included women such as; Louisa May Alcott, Julia Ward Howe, Susan Paul, Maria Stewart, and Lucy Stone. Women in Letters were activists, writers, and strived for positive changes in social justice. This exposure to Miller early in her life acted like a kickstart to her life dedicated to activism and social change for women.  Dress reform  Dress reform is defined as wearing and designing clothing that is more practical and more comfortable than fashion during a specific time period. During the mid to late 1800s, dress reform also meant a rise in feminism, athletic wear, and undergarments. Dress reformers, such as Annie Miller, promoted a larger waist bodice called an emancipation waist. The emancipation waist was still tight however, it was not a corset. Dress reformers were trying to eliminate the need for always wearing corsets to opt for more comfortable and more practical daily attire. More effective and enjoyable undergarments were to follow after the achievement of the emancipation waist due to the success and attention it received by many reformers, activists, and even men enjoyed wearing the ‚Äúreform‚Äù bodices in the winter under their clothing. Another iconic article of clothing that was invented during this time was called the bloomers suit. The bloomers suit was renamed to just bloomers. Bloomers were loose pants that bunched up at the bottom and usually paired with a dress or skirt. Women who wore this typically were victims of harassment in public. Not only did Annie Miller concern herself with dress reform for women but, she also wrote a book called, ‚ÄúMother and Babe‚Äù that included plans, patterns, and ideas for better clothing for babies. Later years, death, and legacy Through the dress reformation, this then led to her becoming an advocate for the dress reform with other like minded women like herself. She would often lecture on topics on athletics and dress, and designed a costume for women which she claimed \\"fulfilled the requirements of both hygiene and art.\\"She would lecture all over the United States and Canada, and many would come and listen to what she had to say. When she was not lecturing, she was the author of two books \\"Physical Beauty,\\" and of \\"Father, Mother and Babe.‚Äù ‚ÄúPhysical Beauty‚Äù talks about her opinions of what is physical beauty, going against higher ideals, individuality, and the dress reform, and many other topics. The topics discussed in this book, is what she was most passionate about. Annie would also ‚Äúpatenten and sell clothing for athletics, leisure and even a business suit for women. But her styles hewed somewhat to the accepted norms so as not to be too provocative. Her middle way appealed to many women who simply wanted comfortable clothes, not a full-on fashion revolution.‚Äù For the last years of her life, she resided in Washington, D.C. where she had a large real estate interest.

Biography Camilo Marks is the son of Loreto Alonso, the sixth daughter of a Spanish communist deputy who \\"escaped the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and arrived in Chile in 1940 with his family after living in France.\\" The writer's grandfather Camilo had the French surname Marqes. This lost its original spelling when his father (also Camilo) was named, and was changed to match its pronunciation: Marks. The couple had a second child, Rodrigo. Camilo's father separated from Loreto (although they never divorced), resided in Valdivia, and had two children with his new partner, whom they named Camilo and Camila. He finished his secondary education at the Internado Nacional Barros Arana, after having studied at the Instituto Nacional. He pursued a law degree at the University of Chile and took his exam before the military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet against the government of Salvador Allende, but he did not graduate until 1975, after changing the subject of his thesis. It had initially been about aircraft hijacking (part of it came out in the first quarter 1974 Public Law Review under the title \\"El delito de apoderamiento il√≠cito de aeronaves\\" (The crime of unlawful seizure of aircraft). At the end of 1975, after working with the and the MIR, he left Chile for England, where he studied literature in London. After returning in the early 1980s, he was reinstated as a lawyer to defend victims of human rights violations by the military dictatorship, first with the Vicariate of Solidarity, and after its dissolution, in the agencies that continued with this work: the Reparation and Reconciliation Corporation, the Human Rights Program of the Ministry of the Interior, and the Valech Commission. Literary career Marks says that he learned to read at an early age, and decided that someday he would become a writer, which in fact happened many years later. \\"Of course, I delayed a lot, maybe too much, in becoming a public one. I am definitely a late writer, and that is due to everything I have in the book and other things I do not tell,\\" Marks said in an interview after the publication of his memoirs in 2015. First, he began to write literary criticism at the Literlex Law School. Then, on his return from exile, he wrote for Apsi magazine, ', Qu√© Pasa, La Tercera, and finally El Mercurio.

The piece is a life-size recumbent male figure rendered in marble sculpture. It depicts the General at the time of his death in the Battle of Shiloh during the American Civil War. Completed in 1903, the piece resides atop Johnston's tomb in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas, where it was installed in 1905. History After his death in 1862, Johnston was first buried in New Orleans; once the Civil War had ended, the Texas Legislature had his body reinterred in the Texas State Cemetery in 1867. In 1901, the Texas Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy brought a bill before the state legislature that appropriated $10,000 for a memorial to be placed over Johnston's grave. Governor Joseph D. Sayers gave the commission to Austin, Texas sculptor Elisabet Ney, whose statues of Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston had recently been approved for installation in the Texas State Capitol. Ney developed the work between 1902 and 1903 in her Austin studio, Formosa (now the Elisabet Ney Museum), where the plaster model is still on display. The final marble version was cut in 1904 in Seravezza, Italy, together with copies of Ney's statues of Austin and Houston intended for the National Statuary Hall Collection in Washington, D.C. After being shipped to the United States, Johnston was displayed in the Texas building at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, where it won a bronze medal. It was then permanently installed at Johnston's tomb in Austin in 1905. Design and interpretation Johnston's tomb, with Ney's statue and iron enclosure in the Texas State Cemetery The statue depicts Johnston lying on a stretcher at the time of his death during the Battle of Shiloh. The figure is recumbent, dressed in the formal military uniform of a Confederate General. Johnston's eyes are closed, and his left arm is folded across his chest, while his right lies alongside him. The statue's legs are draped in a Confederate \\"Southern cross\\" battle flag, which hangs from a broken staff. The statue is protected from the elements by a plexiglas dome, which is then surrounded by a cream- colored wrought-iron enclosure with Gothic revival decorative elements (also designed by Ney). In designing Johnston, Ney aimed for a realistic effect, emphasizing naturalistic details in her composition. The sculpture includes the rough wooden litter and folded cloths on which the dying Johnston is meant to have been carried from the battle. During the work's development, representatives of the Daughters of the Confederacy pressed Ney to include more symbolic or allegorical elements, but Ney refused, insisting upon a scene which could in fact have occurred on the Shiloh battlefield. She did, however, intend the broken flagstaff to poetically suggest that the Confederacy's hopes of victory had been destroyed by Johnston's death. Ney designed the statue's enclosure with open ironwork bars and railings so that the tomb and statue would be visible from all sides without visitors having to enter the mausoleum. She included Gothic elements (such as pinnacles on the roofline, tracery on the gables, and crocket capitals on the corner columns) to give the site a solemn and religious quality. Ney also incorporated Texas lone stars into the Gothic tracery to mark Johnston's grave as a commemoration of a notable Texan.

One of five combat battalions assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team (1AD), 4-27 FA currently fields approximately 600 artillery and support personnel, operating self-propelled M109A6 howitzers, and providing direct fire support to the brigade. Originally formed as a training unit in 1918 during the waning months of WW I, 4-27 FA served extensively in WW 2 and has taken part in several other conflicts and peacekeeping missions. The unit has achieved two notable battlefield distinctions to date. The first during Operation Desert Storm, when the battalion played a significant role in the 1st Armored Division's defeat of the Iraqi Republican Guard at the Battle of Medina Ridge. The second occurred 12 years later during Operation Iraqi Freedom, when 4-27 FA served in a US Army pilot project to convert artillery units into ad-hoc motorized infantry battalions and deploy them in a variety of infantry and military police roles throughout central Baghdad, which earned the battalion the Presidential Unit Citation.  History   Formation  The 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery (FA) was first formed on July 5, 1918 as a training unit and part of the 9th Infantry Division, at Camp McClellan, Alabama. No units in the division were deployed during World War I. During the interwar period, 4-27 FA was reassigned multiple times as an inactive/active training unit in both the Regular Army and Army Reserves.  World War II  While fluctuating in size from just a single 8-gun battery to an extended 32-gun battalion, 4-27 FA was assigned to the 1st Armored Division (1AD) throughout the war. Primarily equipped with 105mm M7 SP guns, the unit fought in seven major campaigns during World War II: * Algeria-French Morocco (as part of the initial Operation Torch invasion) * Tunisia (including Battle of Kasserine Pass) * Naples-Foggia * Anzio * Rome-Arno * North Apennines * Po Valley After the war, the battalion was briefly converted into a military police unit (Troop A, 27th Constabulary Squadron) and remained on garrison duty in Germany for two years. In 1948, the unit was reassigned back to 1AD as an artillery unit, based out of Fort Hood, Texas.  Cold War  During the early years of the Cold War, 4-27 FA went through several reassignments, reorganizations and occasional deactivation periods, with some batteries reassigned to other elements of the 27th FA regiment and stationed in the US to serve as training commands. The rest of the batteries deployed to West Germany in support of NATO. At least one battery of the unit was continuously stationed in either Babenhausen or Baumholder, West Germany from 1959 to 1985. These batteries were assigned to 1 AD's division artillery (DIVARTY), part of NATO's Central Army Group, and tasked primarily with defending the Fulda Gap corridor from a Warsaw Pact assault. As a dual-purpose training/maneuver unit, 4-27 FA was one of the first combat units to integrate African-American service members into the US Army's artillery branch, in both officer and enlisted ranks, following President Truman's Executive Order 9981. In 1985, all of the battalion's howitzer batteries were consolidated into a new rocket artillery unit at Peden Barracks based in Wertheim, Germany, and rearmed with the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System.  Persian Gulf War  On November 4, 1990, the 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery was deployed to defend Saudi Arabia from Iraqi invasion as part of Operation Desert Shield in late December 1990. When the defense of Saudi Arabia mission gave way to the liberation of Kuwait, 4-27 FA provided extensive fire support for the 1st Armored Division. During the ensuing 96 hours of Operation Desert Storm, the battalion unleashed major bombardments with their 27 M270 MLRS launchers against Iraqi forces. Throughout four days of combat, including the initial breach of Iraqi lines and the battles of Al Busayyah and Medina Ridge, the unit conducted one of the US Army's largest artillery bombardments since the Second World War. All totaled, 4-27 FA fired 588 M26 \\"cluster bomb\\" rockets into Iraqi forces and inflicted several thousand casualties in advance of 1st AD's armored assault. To put the scale of this bombardment into perspective, each rocket contained 644 DPICM bomblet submunitions, for a total of 378,672 warheads. US service members nicknamed these barrages \\"steel rain.\\" While in practice many targets received multiple salvos and the submunitions had a 2‚Äì5% dud rate, if each rocket 4-27 FA fired during the operation had been spaced out to optimize the submunition dispersal, the barrage would have theoretically blasted a target area of 49 square kilometers. On February 16, 1997, 4-27 FA was reactivated at Baumholder, Germany, and converted to a direct support howitzer battalion, armed with 155 mm M109A6 Paladin's.  Peacekeeping operations in former Yugoslavia  In 1999, Battery A, a detachment of Forward Observers and support elements from the Headquarters and Service Battery were deployed with Task Force Hawk during Operation Noble Anvil in Albania and Kosovo. The entire unit was deployed to Kosovo from November 23, 2000 to May 28, 2001 in support of peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia.  Operation Iraqi Freedom  In April 2003, 4-27 FA returned to the Kuwaiti desert in preparation for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the first of three year or longer deployments for the battalion during the 2nd Iraq War. With the exception of some Forward Observers on loan to infantry units, the bulk of the battalion saw no combat during the initial invasion. Although this peaceful period did not last long. Arriving in Baghdad on May 1, 2003, the same day of President Bush's \\"Mission Accomplished Speech\\", 4-27FA assumed responsibility for the Al Karkh district in central Baghdad, Iraq. While not an infantry unit, the battalion traded in their howitzers for Humvees and fought as a motorized infantry battalion, conducting only occasional counter battery missions against insurgent mortars and rocket attacks. Elements of 4-27 FA took part as regular infantry in Operations Iron Hammer, Iron Justice, Iron Grip, Longstreet, Iron Bullet, Iron Promise and Iron Sabre during this time frame. For the next year, the battalion's other assignments included hunting down the remaining Fedayeen forces, patrolling and keeping peace in the Muhallah's (neighborhoods) inside the Al Karkh district, as well as guarding several strategic points from vandals and insurgents. Most notably, the UN administered food warehouses and distribution center in Baghdad's central railyard. In April 2004, the battalion‚Äôs deployment was extended by three months. 4-27FA was tasked with retaking and keeping clear the supply routes south of Baghdad, around Iskandariah and Al Kut, from a radical militia that had taken control of much of the rural area outside of the city. Within 60 days, 4-27 FA and the rest of the 2nd BCT (1AD) task force defeated local militia forces and restored (albeit temporarily) stability to the surrounding region. The battalion redeployed to Baumholder, Germany in July 2004 after 15 months of continuous action. In November 2005, the battalion deployed again to Kuwait in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This time, the battalion was formally reorganized and trained as a motorized rifle battalion, serving as part of the theater reserve in the 1AD. Large elements from the battalion, including all the Forward Observers, were called up to engage and suppress various insurgent groups in different hotspots throughout Iraq. The battalion redeployed back to Baumholder, Germany in November 2006. On April 7, 2008, during the height of Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006‚Äì08) the battalion deployed for a final time to the city of Madain in Iraq as motorized infantry. In late October 2008, the battalion was reassigned (except for C Battery) to the Macmahdia Province (south of Baghdad). After reestablishing order, the task force handed control off to local Iraq forces and redeployed back to Baumholder, Germany in late May 2009. On July 15, 2009, the entire unit left Germany after three generations of garrison duty and moved to its current homebase at Fort Bliss, TX.  Current role  The current 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery \\"Iron Thunder\\" battalion was reactivated at Fort Bliss, Texas on September 15, 2010 with the 2nd Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 1st AD. In November 2010, the battalion assumed its current mission as a test and evaluation force for future artillery weapons, munitions, programs and tactics. In support of this mission, 4-27 FA became the US Army's first composite direct support field artillery battalion, equipped with both self- propelled and towed howitzers. In 2011, 4-27 FA was the first unit to test and evaluate the Army‚Äôs newest howitzer, the M109A7, under the Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) program. In the summer of 2017, 4-27 FA, along with its parent 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, was released from the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) ending its role as a testing platform for emerging technologies and systems under testing. 4-27 FA and 2/1 AD transitioned back to the US Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) \\"ready-pool\\" for overseas deployments. In October 2017, 4-27 FA along with 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division deployed overseas to Kuwait, with detachments to Iraq, as part of US Central Command (CENTCOM) in support of Operation Spartan Shield and Operation Inherent Resolve. Additionally, the Battalion supported the Brigade with multiple partnership exercises in concert with allied forces from Jordan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and others. In July 2018, the Battalion returned from their overseas deployment and transitioned to training, reset and preparation for future missions. In early 2020, the Battalion made ready to deploy to Europe but due to COVID-10 the deployment was cancelled. Upon redeployment to Fort Bliss two Batteries began preparing for deployment to the Middle East in August, 2020.

Early life James Lorimer \\"Lorrie\\" Graham Jr. was born in New York City on January 21, 1835, the son of Gen. Nathan Burr Graham. He was the brother of R.M.C. Graham, President of the Metropolitan Insurance Company and nephew of James Lorimer Graham and John A. Graham. His father, Gen. Nathan Burr Graham, belonged to a prominent New York family, and his mother, Marie Antoinette McCoskry, came of good old Scotch stock. Her uncle, Robert McCoskry, was one of the founders and the first President of the Chemical Bank. Graham was educated in New York until he was about sixteen, and was then sent to Amiens, France, to complete his education. There he lived for some years with a cousin who had married a French gentleman of position and prominence, pursuing his studies. On account of his precocious literary skill he was selected to deliver a poetical address of welcome to Alphonse de Lamartine, when that statesman visited the school in 1848. Afterwards spent some time in Paris in completing his education. During his sojourn abroad he became a proficient French scholar, and retained all his life his fluency and perfect accent, so rare to any foreigner, and was often mistaken for a Frenchman. Career After graduation he lived for a time in Rio Janeiro, Brazil. Back to New York City he left again aboard of the steamer USS San Francisco from New York to San Francisco, first steamship which attempted to make the trip and which sank off Cape Hatteras. Walt Whitman was a fellow passenger, and composed a poem about the shipwreck. The ship belonged to the old shipping house of Rowland & Aspinwall, with whom Graham was then enrolled as a clerk. He and one of the younger Aspinwalls were the only passengers in the cabin; but the ship carried many emigrants; and when it was wrecked, the passengers were picked up by different sailing vessels, and carried off to various ports; so that many weeks elapsed after the loss of the ship was reported before Lorrie appeared once more at his father's home in New York, emaciated from illness, starvation and exposure, and having saved nothing but the clothes on his back, and one opal stud. The injuries he sustained left him lasting physical disturbances. He was a librarian and editor of the Putnam's Magazine, a monthly periodical featuring American literature and articles on science, art, and politics. Circa 1869 he was named United States Consul General in Florence. When the capital was transferred to Rome, Graham remained behind, preferring to accept the simple position of Consul rather than change his Italian home. He was a member of the Century Club and one of its first librarian, and was a member of the Geographical Society. Personal life On November 19, 1855, he married Josephine A. Garner (1837-1892), the daughter of Thomas Garner, a wealthy merchant of New York and sister of Commodore William T. Garner. In New York City he lived at 3 E. 17th Street, while in Florence he resided at Casa Guidi, Palazzo di Valfonda and Via Manzoni. His homes were always opened, with the most free and bountiful hospitality, to his countrymen, and very few who visited Florence escaped a welcome there. It has been suggested that, even if married, Graham was gay. He was friends with painters and sculptors: John Frederick Kensett, Frederic Edwin Church, R√©gis Fran√ßois Gignoux, Emanuel Leutze, John Cranch and Christopher Pearse Cranch, Eastman Johnson, William Holman Hunt, Hiram Powers, George Henry Boughton, F.

He died on June 30, 1876, in Florence, and is buried inside the English Cemetery, Florence, the medallion on his tombstone is by Launt Thompson.

During his long career, American film director John Hughes has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these productions fell in development hell or were cancelled. 1970s National Lampoon's Jaws 3, People 0 In 1979, Matty Simmons hired Hughes and Tod Carroll to write the script of the third Jaws film as a National Lampoon parody from Universal Pictures. According to Simmons, the film was to star Bo Derek and Richard Dreyfuss and be directed by Joe Dante. Rodger Bumpass was also to appear in the film.page 349 However, Steven Spielberg, who directed the first film, managed to convince Universal not to make the film by threatening to never work with the studio again. Nevertheless, Simmons credits the unmade film as to how Hughes began his career the film industry. 1980s The History of Ohio from the Beginning of Time to the End of the Universe In the early 1980s, Hughes and P. J. O'Rourke scripted an unproduced adaptation of National Lampoon Sunday Newspaper Parody which they titled The History of Ohio from the Beginning of Time to the End of the Universe. According to O'Rourke, \\"We never really got it to work and finally abandoned it. But it was fun to work together.\\"page 38 The New Kid During the 1980s, Hughes wrote a script titled The New Kid, and it was based on his experiences growing up.page 131 According to Kirk Honeycutt, the story was \\"about a teenager's experiences in a new high school in Arizona\\".page 96 When Hughes offered Howard Deutch the choice to direct either The New Kid or Pretty in Pink (1986), Deutch chose to direct the latter film. The Last Good Year Anthony Michael Hall claims that during the making of The Breakfast Club (1985), Hughes had an idea for a movie which he titled The Last Good Year: \\"At one point when we were doing The Breakfast Club, John had an idea for a movie called The Last Good Year. It was something that he pitched to me as something he wanted to do with me, about the last good year being 1962, before the Beatles‚Äô invasion. Maybe it was a sarcastic title. The idea was, I think, that the cultural shift was significant to him‚Äîthe crossover in time from Pat Boone America to Beatles America. He didn't have too many of the story elements worked out, but, man, did he have a mix tape put together.\\" Lovecats Molly Ringwald claims that after he finished The Breakfast Club, Hughes had written a script based on The Cure song, \\"The Lovecats\\". Oil and Vinegar After he finished Pretty in Pink, Hughes wrote the script of a film titled Oil and Vinegar, which was to star Matthew Broderick and Molly Ringwald. According to Inquisitr, Broderick and Ringwald were to portray a couple who \\"spend a day in a motel room, swapping stories on life and love\\". According to Broderick, \\"It was very intimate: it was just the two of them, basically, is my memory, often in a car. It was a very typical romantic comedy about two very different people who fell in love, but it was very inventive in its smallness.\\"pages 234-235 The film was to have released by Universal Pictures, but Hughes objected when the studio asked for rewrites. Therefore, the creative differences between Hughes and Universal, along with Broderick and Ringwald's scheduling conflicts, are credited for why the film was never made. 1990s Bartholomew vs. Neff In 1990, it was reported that Hughes would direct Sylvester Stallone and John Candy in a comedy he had written titled Bartholomew vs. Neff for Carolco Pictures.page 252 The film was to have been about feuding neighbors. Hughes had planned to direct the film right after he finished Curly Sue (1991). According to the Los Angeles Times, principal photography was scheduled to take place in the suburbs of Chicago during the summer of 1991. The film was never made. Black Cat Bone: The Return of Huckleberry Finn In 1991, it was reported that Hughes would write, produce and direct Black Cat Bone: The Return of Huckleberry Finn for 20th Century Fox. It was to have been about the character that was created by Mark Twain but be set in modern times. Principal photography for that film was scheduled to begin on March 16, 1992. However, it was reported that Hughes was competing against TriStar Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures, since both studios were also trying to make a Huckleberry Finn movie. Disney eventually succeeded over Fox and TriStar following the completion of The Adventures of Huck Finn (1993). Peanuts In 1992, it was reported that Hughes would write and produce a live action adaptation of Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts for Warner Bros. Hughes reportedly visited Schulz at his home in Santa Clara, California to talk about adapting Peanuts into a film.pages 176-177 According to Variety, Hughes planned to start writing the script on Christmas of 1992 and finish it by the spring of 1993; Hughes also did not verify that he would direct the film. It is believed that the critical failure of Dennis the Menace (1993), which Hughes wrote and produced for WB, is what prevented the movie from being made. The film was finally released in 2015 by Blue Sky Studios and 20th Century Fox Animation. The Pajama Game Variety reported in 1992 that Hughes and Warner Bros. were to do a remake of the 1957 film The Pajama Game. Damn Yankees In 1993, Hughes reportedly wrote a script adapted from the musical Damn Yankees, but it never came to fruition. The Bee Due to the commercial success of Home Alone (1990), Hughes felt determined to make The Bee, a live action family comedy film that he wrote that required a $50 million budget. According to Daniel Stern, The Bee is about \\"an architect who was trying to finish his project that day and a bee comes into the house and the guy gets distracted by the bee. And the entire movie is the bee forcing the guy to destroy his own house and take his life apart.\\" Kirk Honeycutt claims that The Bee was inspired by Hughes' \\"involvement in the development of Redwing Farms, where he worked to reforest the land and turn it into a proper English farm.\\" It is said that of Hughes' script, only ten pages of it contained dialogue. The Bee was initially developed at 20th Century Fox, but by early 1993, Hughes sold the project to Warner Bros. after Fox passed on it. Then in May 1994, WB put the project in turnaround. By June that same year, it was officially announced that Hughes would write, produce and direct The Bee for Walt Disney Pictures with a budget of $25 million. Simon Brew credits Hughes's 1994 departure from Hollywood, along with the critical and financial failure of Baby's Day Out (1994), which he wrote and produced for Fox, as factors that led to the film's cancellation. In later reports, Daniel Stern claimed that he was going to direct the film. According to Stern, Hughes visited him on the set of Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), showed him the script of The Bee and asked him to direct it. Stern further claimed that he worked on the script with Hughes. It has also been reported that Steve Martin was considered to star in the film.  Dumb and Dumber  According to Kirk Honeycutt, Hughes wrote an incomplete initial draft of the Dumb and Dumber script; he eventually abandoned the script, sold it to the Farrelly brothers and had his name removed.page 5 Tickets In 1996, Hughes had written a script titled Tickets. According to Bradford Evans, \\"Tickets was a script that followed a group of teenage strangers camped out all night in zero degree weather for tickets to their favorite band‚Äôs farewell show.\\" The script was never made into a film due to the release of the similarly themed film Detroit Rock City (1999). 2000s Grisbys Go Broke In 2002, Hughes had written a script titled Grisbys Go Broke, which was about a wealthy family in Chicago who spend their Christmas bankrupt. It was later reported in 2010 that Paramount Pictures bought the rights to the script. However, the studio officially confirmed that it was not negotiated to purchase the script.

As an adult, Goodman is lonely and single; he is also a well-known professor and television presenter whose show is devoted to debunking fraudulent psychics, which he regards as his life's work to stop people's lives being ruined by superstition the way his family's were. He receives an invitation to visit a famed 1970s paranormal investigator, Charles Cameron, who inspired him as a boy, but who has been missing for decades and is now living in a caravan, sick and impoverished. Cameron asks him to investigate three incidents of supposedly real supernatural ghost sightings. The first case is a night watchman, Tony Matthews, whose wife has died of cancer and who feels guilty that he stopped visiting his daughter, who suffers from locked-in syndrome. He was haunted by the spirit of a young girl while working in a disused asylum for women. The second is a teenager, Simon Rifkind, who is obsessed with the occult and has a poor relationship with his parents. His car breaks down after running over the Devil in the woods. Goodman, although unsettled by the second case, believes that each of them has an obvious rational explanation: the supposed victims imagined them, based on their neuroses. The third case is a financier in the City, Mike Priddle, who was plagued by a poltergeist while awaiting the birth of his child. His wife's ghost appeared to him as she died giving birth to an (it is implied) inhuman child. Suddenly, the financier commits suicide with a shotgun. Goodman returns to Cameron, who tears a latex mask off his face, revealing himself to be Priddle. Goodman at first believes that he is the victim of an elaborate hoax, but reality soon breaks down altogether. Priddle leads Goodman back in time to the scene of a childhood incident in which he watched two bullies entice a mentally disabled boy into a drain, where he died of an asthma attack. Goodman has felt guilty all his life about his failure to rescue the victim. The decaying corpse of the bullied boy appears, tormenting Goodman and leading him to a hospital bed, where he is made to lie down. The ghoul lies on top of him and forces his finger into Goodman's mouth as Goodman cries \\"No, not again!\\" implying this is a recurring event. In the real world, Goodman is in a hospital with tubes in his mouth. He suffers from locked-in syndrome after a suicide attempt in his car. All the characters and events Goodman has experienced were inspired by the staff and objects in his hospital room. The doctors incorrectly believe him to be in a persistent vegetative state with no awareness of his surroundings. The junior doctor predicts that Goodman is \\"here for keeps\\", without a chance of recovery. As he leaves the room, the senior doctor says to his junior colleague: \\"I hope his dreams are sweet\\". The hospital cleaner, in contrast, chats to Goodman and moves a mirror to give him a different view. Cast Jeremy Dyson has an uncredited appearance as the DJ at Phillip's Bar Mitzvah. Reception Ghost Stories was described by The Guardian as \\"an anthology of creepy supernatural tales in the intensely English tradition of Amicus portmanteau movies from the 1960s.\\" On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 124 reviews, and an average rating of 7.11/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Ghost Stories offers a well-crafted, skillfully told horror anthology that cleverly toys with genre tropes while adding a few devilishly frightful twists.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \\"generally favourable reviews.\\" References External links Ghost Stories review on iHorror 2017 films 2017 horror films British films British ghost films British horror films British supernatural horror films The Devil in fiction Demons in film Films about nightmares British horror anthology films Lionsgate films 2010s supernatural horror films Suicide in film ","title":"Ghost Stories (2017 film)"},{"id":"55459287","text":"Kninsko Polje is a village near Knin, ≈†ibenik-Knin County, Croatia.

She was the 13th woman on the registry of the British Medical Association. Early life and education Alice Jane Shannan Ker was born on 2 December 1853 at Deskford in Banffshire, Scotland. She was the eldest of the nine children of Margaret Millar Stevenson (1826‚Äì1900), daughter of James Cochran Stevenson, Liberal MP for South Shields, and Reverend William Turnbull Ker (1824‚Äì1885), a Free Church minister. At the age of 18 she moved to Edinburgh to study \\"University Classes for Ladies\\" including anatomy and physiology. While in Edinburgh, she met Sophia Jex-Blake, who was campaigning to have the University issue medical degrees to women. When Jex-Blake's petition was rejected by the University, Ker left Edinburgh to complete her medical training in Ireland where she was awarded her licentiateship from the King and Queen's College of Physicians of Ireland. Career After completing her training, she returned to Edinburgh sharing a practice with Jex-Blake for a year. She was the 13th woman to be registered as a doctor in Britain.Alice Ker, Spartacus Educational, Retrieved 5 October 2017 Ker then undertook further studies for a year in Berne, Switzerland, funded by her campaigning aunts Flora and Louisa Stevenson. When she returned to Britain she worked as a house surgeon at the Children's Hospital in Birmingham, and from there became a general practitioner in Leeds. In 1887, she returned to Edinburgh working as a self-employed doctor, and taking the Royal College of Surgeons Conjoint Examinations, one of only two woman in that year to pass the finals. She married her cousin, Edward Stewart Ker (1839‚Äì1907), in 1888, and they moved to Birkenhead. Together they had two daughters Margaret Louise (born 1892) and Mary Dunlop (born 1896); their son died in infancy.Alice Stewart Ker, OxfordDNB, Retrieved 5 October 2017 Her practice was in Birkenhead, the only woman doctor in the area.

She also gave talks and lectures to working-class women in Manchester on topics of sexuality, birth control and motherhood. These talks were published in 1891 work, Motherhood: A Book for Every Woman. Suffrage movement  In 1893, Ker became involved in the Birkenhead and Wirral Women's Suffrage Society, and after her husband's death in 1907, her interest in women's suffrage became an increasing priority for her. She became chair of the local Suffrage Society but finding them too moderate, in 1907 with Alice Morrissey, she joined the more progressive Women's Social and Political Union. Ker worked with Ada Flatman who was a WSPU employee. Flatman and Patricia Woodlock organised the WSPU shop which raised substantial funds for the cause. In March 1912, she was imprisoned after being among 200 women breaking windows at Harrods Department store, an action organised by the Women's Social and Political Union. She was force fed whilst in Holloway prison, and as result she was released with ill health before the end of her two-month sentence.

The farmhouse, built about 1740, is a fine example of period architecture, with later 19th century stylistic alterations. The property is notable as one of New Hampshire's first market garden farms, a practice adopted by John Emery in 1855. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Description and history Emery Farm is located in the dispersed center of Stratham, on the west side of Emery Lane, a former through road now bypassed by Portsmouth Street (New Hampshire Route 108) just to the east. The property includes a large house and barn. The house is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central brick chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Windows are framed by simple moulded trim, while the centered entrance is framed by pilasters and a corniced entablature. Its interior follows a typical center-chimney plan, with a narrow vestibule that has a winding staircase, and parlor spaces to either side of the chimney. A two-story ell extends to the rear. The barn is a large 19th-century structure, with an attached corn crib, several animal stalls, and space used historically as living space by farmhands. The main block of the house was built about 1740, and in its early years served as Chase's Tavern, a meeting place at which civic and commercial activity took place in the rural community. It was enlarged by the Emery family to accommodate several generations. In 1855 John Emery began producing cash crop vegetables, which he sold door-to-door in communities from Dover to Portsmouth. This is believed to be the first instance of market garden farming in the state, and the practice spread to a number of Stratham's other farms. Emery is also credited with introducing fresh strawberries to Portsmouth, something that had otherwise been a scarce commodity. The property continued to be used for many years as a market garden farm by Emery's son John Fred Emery.

Early life Estelle Turrell Smith was born in Forest Lake Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, on October 30, 1854. Her father's people were among the first settlers of Pennsylvania, emigrating at an early day from Connecticut. Her mother's family were Quakers. Her mother's maiden name was Gurney, and she was a descendant of Joseph John Gurney and Elizabeth Fry. In childhood Smith was thought old for her years, was fond of poetry and music, and delighted in the studies of natural science. She became early acquainted with the fauna and flora about her country home. Her studies commenced at home and were pursued in the Montrose Academy, Montrose, Pennsylvania. Career She started to teach when seventeen years of age, at the same time continuing her special studies, then among the masters of art and song. In 1875 she moved with her parents to Longmont, Colorado. She taught two years in the State Agricultural College in Fort Collins, Colorado. After the death of her husband, she became more deeply interested in the problems of woman's progress. Having means and leisure at her command, she devoted much time to the study and support of social reforms. Her devotion to the work of reform and her frequent contributions to the press soon won for her a place as a leader. Soon after her second marriage, she was elected president of the Polk County Woman Suffrage Society. She was an efficient member of the State executive committee for four years, and president of the State Woman Suffrage Association of Iowa. At her instigation a series of mothers' mass meetings was held in Des Moines. The large City Hall was filled again and again, hundreds of women taking active part. Smith was chosen president of the meetings. Through those meetings a bill regulating the property rights of women was presented to the State legislature.

Career In his youth, Marcellus belonged to the court clergy and was probably a member of the royal chapel during the reign of Ladislaus I of Hungary. He was also a provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, √ìbuda or Titel. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, Ladislaus, who laid on his deathbed, sent Palatine Peter and Marcellus to Poland to negotiate the king's deputy Sieciech in the summer of 1095. The Hungarian delegation invited the king's exiled nephew Coloman back from Poland to become his heir. Another chapter of the chronicle styles Marcellus as \\"sanctus\\", which referred to his pious nature and exemplary saintly way of life despite his young age, as medievalist L√°szl√≥ Koszta argued. After the coronation of Coloman in 1096, he became an important confidant of the new monarch. Sometimes at the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries, he was made Bishop of V√°c. It is plausible he is identical with that prelate, who was mentioned without his see in 1103. The first known holder of the title, he was mentioned in that capacity by the two establishing charters of the Zobor Abbey, issued in 1111 and 1113. The cathedral of V√°c was built by Coloman's father G√©za I, where he was buried too, which fact confirms the strong alliance between the king and Marcellus. In the two Zobor charters, Marcellus appeared in seventh and eighth places at the list of prelates (which reflects hierarchy among them), respectively. He participated in the first and second synods at Esztergom. Alongside six bishops and several secular barons, Marcellus escorted Coloman to Dalmatia in 1111, who confirmed the privileges of Split, Trogir, and Zadar. The event was narrated by a royal charter from 1118, which ranks Marcellus to the second place among the prelates. Koszta considered it reflects to the situation when the charter was written, thus Marcellus already functioned as Archbishop of Esztergom in 1118 (his predecessor Lawrence died approximately two years ago). Nevertheless, Marcellus first and only appeared in that dignity in July 1124. Marcellus was present at the burial of Coloman in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and the coronation of Stephen II in 1116. He was the first known Archbishop of Esztergom, who was transferred from another diocese. In July 1124, he belonged to the companion of Stephen II, who visited Dalmatia to confirm his father's former grants and privileges to the coastal cities. It confirms that Marcellus had also participated in the royal campaign against the province, taking advantage of the temporary absence of the Venetian fleet from the Adriatic Sea. In the same year, Marcellus was also mentioned by a non-authentic charter on the occasion of a lawsuit between Othmar, isp√°n of Bars County and Henry, abbot of Garamszentbenedek (today Hronsk√Ω Be≈àadik, Slovakia), when Marcellus and other bishops appeared as investigators and judges. Still in 1124, Marcellus met papal legate Giles, who travelled to Germany through Hungary. As his successor Felician was referred to as archbishop by a charter dated between around the years 1125 and 1128, Marcellus possibly died not long after his last appearance in contemporary documents.

Access to information can be blocked by various means including geography, access to technology, financial standing, and identity. The type of information that is obstructed is often the most skilled, researched, and credible. This creates a power dynamic where there are parts of a society who can benefit from this access and those who are marginalized because of a lack of access. Information privilege is closely tied with information literacy. Information literacy is the ability to identify, locate, evaluate, and use information to solve an issue, as such, access to information is a necessary human right to be information literate. Various human rights declarations include a component of information literacy and/or access to information. In addition, the librarian profession is founded on and advocates for access to information.  National and international statements  Below is a list of national and international statements declaring access to information as a basic human right that should be upheld: * United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights ‚Äì Article 19 states that an individual has the right to hold their opinion and their opinion should be held \\"without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of any frontiers\\". * International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions' (IFLA) Beacons of the Information Society: The Alexandria Proclamation for Information Literacy and Lifelong Learning states information literacy is a \\"basic human right in a digital world\\" and advocates \\"institutions to meet technological, economic and social challenges, to redress disadvantage and to advance the well-being of all\\". * The Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report from the Association of College and Research Libraries recognized the problems associated with lack of access to credible information. It states, \\"problems are more difficult to solve when people lack access to meaningful information vital to good decision making.\\" * The American Library Association Bill of Rights states \\"all libraries are forums for information and ideas\\" and in the published follow up, Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights states, \\"Libraries and librarians protect and promote these rights by selecting, producing, providing access to, identifying, retrieving, organizing, providing instruction in the use of, and preserving recorded expression regardless of the format or technology.\\"  ACRL framework  The Association of College and Research Libraries developed the Framework for Information Literacy which is meant to guide the instruction of information literacy to college students. The ACRL Framework first mentions the term \\"information privilege\\" in the frame titled Information Has Value. It discusses the legal and socioeconomic circumstances that can influence the production of, and access to, information. It encourages learners to recognize their own information privilege and acknowledge that some individuals and groups are underrepresented especially in academic publishing. Some argue that the ACRL Framework does not go far enough to teach learners of information literacy about the social injustice issue of lack of access. It is advised that more explicit instructions be included on how learners can combat the injustice in access to information.  Barriers to access  Researcher and educator Laura Saunders defines three barriers to access as physical, social, and cognitive/intellectual barriers. Physical barriers to access include not only geographical barriers but also access to the technology that will allow a person access to particular sources. As the internet became more popular and information became more readily available online, companies developed database subscription services that allowed individuals to access only the most reliable and well researched information. However access to this information was hidden behind a paywall where only a person with financial means or an affiliation with an education institution could have access. Saunders' idea of social barriers to access implies there is a barrier to information based on a cultural or socioeconomic circle of communication. Marginalized groups may not participate in a society they are distrusting of and therefore the information sources they trust may not be as vast or diverse. Access is limited because they only receive information from a small circle of people they trust. They may also not ask for help as readily as more privileged groups do. James Piccininni has stated that this social exclusion of groups of people in \\"social, economic, and political spheres\\" creates a power dynamic that dictates how information is created, distributed, and accessed. The third barrier to access is cognitive/intellectual access and ties in best with information literacy. Without learning the skills to locate, evaluate, and use information, a person may be susceptible to misinformation, propaganda, fake news, and general false statements, leaving them at a disadvantage and an inability to find reliable information. An advantage to providing access to information within a community is that it allows the voices of the most brilliant within a demographic to be heard when they might otherwise have been discounted or marginalized. Open access  Much of the most reliable and current information in a particular field is found behind a paywall where only persons associated with an educational institution or professional organization, or the monetary means to purchase journal subscriptions has access to this information. The inherent issues of academic publishing created a growing advocacy for the open access movement.

Partner and co-founder of the venture fund - \\"Kite Ventures\\". Residing in London (UK) since 2004.  Family  Georgy (‚ÄúEgor‚Äù) Shuppe‚Äôs father, Nikolay Georgievich Shuppe, was a doctor of science of biology at the Academy of Science of the USSR and professor. His mother, Nadezhda Isaacovna Kikoin, was a patent specialist. She was the daughter of Isaac Konstantinovich Kikoin, academic of the Academy of Science of the USSR, physicist. He was one of the founding fathers of the Soviet nuclear program and the Kurchatov Institute, twice-awarded hero of Socialist Labour and winner of the Lenin Prize. From 1997 ‚Äì 2012 Shuppe was married to Ekaterina Berezovskaya, daughter of Boris Berezovsky (businessman). He is a father of four.  Career   Early years  1977-1987 Egor studied in school No. 171 in a specialised class under the patronage of the Chemical faculty of the Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov. He studied chemistry and biology. In 1984, Egor became the winner of the Moscow City Chemistry Olympiad. Between 1987- 1989, Egor studied biologically active compounds at the department of Chemistry and Technology, the Institute of Fine Chemical Technologies (in 2015 it merged with the Moscow State University of information technologies, radio-technics and electronics (MIREA, MGUPI) and re-named the Moscow Technological University). From the late ‚Äò80s, Egor Shuppe began demonstrating an interest in computers, genetics, and IT; participated in the import of the first personal computers into the USSR and later, in Russia, created the first computer department in the Institute of General Genetics named after N.I. Vavilov. During 1991-1992 he worked as the deputy to the Commercial Director of the first Russian art place, Centre of Modern Art on Yakimanka, founded in 1990 by art specialist Leonid Bazhanov. In 1991-1996 he became the vice president of the Trading House ¬´Negotiant¬ª and head of the ¬´Magnat¬ª holding, involved in various business projects including agriculture, creation of automobile distribution chains, design and implementation of a chain of petrol stations, etc.  Cityline  In 1996, together with Emelian Zakharov and Rafael Filinov, Egor founded the company Cityline, which became the first and largest private internet provider in Russia. In 1997 Damian Kudryavtsev joined the team and later in 1999, Dmitry Bosov and Maxim Barsky. Egor Shuppe was one of the main shareholders and President of the company. In 1996 the overall amount of Internet users in Russia was only 60,000, the Russian segment of the Internet consisting of only a few websites. In order to attract new users and increase the revenues per user (at that time access to the Internet was on a time payment basis), Cityline made a strategic decision to invest in the creation of free Russian content. That was when the company NetSkate, a production centre for new Russian online media, was established. For the development of NetSkate projects, Anton Nossik came to Russia from Israel and Artemy Lebedev ‚Äì from the USA. The design Art. Lebedev Studio and Lenta.ru started in NetSkate. Among the most popular NetSkate projects were: ¬´The Evening Internet¬ª by Anton Nosik, ¬´Locomotive-news¬ª by Alexander Gagin, ¬´Hayloft¬ª by Sergey Kuznetsov, ¬´Anecdotes from Russia¬ª by Dmitry Verner, etc. Cityline was acquired in 2001 by Golden Telecom. At that point it had over 150,000 clients.  Venture business in the UK  In 2002 Egor Shuppe moved from Russia and from 2004, he now lives and works in London. He has acted as a business angel for a variety of hi-tech projects helping raise investments for innovative projects in Great Britain, Germany, USA and Eastern Europe. In 2008, together with Edward Shenderovich, Egor Shuppe created an investment fund for technological and internet projects ‚Äì Kite Ventures. Over the years, the fund has invested over 400 million dollars into many acclaimed projects. Amongst the most famous projects realised by the fund is the German company, Delivery Hero, which had its IPO in July 2017 on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Tradeshift ‚Äì a cloud service connecting the customers and sellers to companies such as Groupon, Fyber, Mydeco.com and others.  The ‚ÄúMineev case‚Äù and extradition attempt to Russia  On 18th of August, 2017, the judgement of the Westminster Magistrates‚Äô Court discharged the request of the Russian Federation to extradite Georgy Shuppe. The Russian investigative authorities had accused Shuppe and businessman Mikhail Nekrich, of ordering the murder of businessman Alexander Mineev. Mikhail Nekrich, in turn, claimed that representatives of the Russian Special Services had bribed him to slander Shuppe and in return, had offered to drop all charges against him. The English court concluded that the prosecution against Mr. Shuppe in Russia was unjustified and was performed with numerous significant violations of the law. The conclusion of judge Kenneth Grant states: ‚ÄúI am satisfied that this case would be decided by influence and pressure on the judge to convict ‚Ä¶ whatever the strength or weakness of the prosecution case‚Äù. The court also called attention to the fact that accusations against Shuppe were based explicitly on the testimony of two witnesses, one of whom was an anonymous witness and the other - already had rejected his testimony. The Russian Federation did not challenge the court's judgment. The court returned the paid bail to Shuppe and released him from any other restrictions. Shuppe himself expressly denies his involvement in the ¬´Mineev case¬ª and insists that, probably, he had become a victim of a collusion between the Russian Special Services and organised crime. In his opinion, one of the elements of this scheme was to use his name and status for the purpose of protraction of the investigation in Russia: whilst the investigation was in process, profits from the associated real estate had been received by individuals connected with the company FORUS; the general director of all those companies that own the property, according to the BBC, is Alexander Shibakov. Shuppe suspects that the criminals and Special Services are sharing this revenue.  Piatigorsky‚Äôs Classes  From 2002, Egor Shuppe had strong personal and business relations with the world famous Russian and British philosopher, orientalist and writer, Alexander Piatigorsky, who also lived in London. During the period between 2006-2009, Egor Shuppe, together with Alexander Piatigorsky, created a series of philosophical seminars which were named ¬´AMP Classes¬ª. Over 50 seminars were held and over 400 hours of audio and video were recorded. The texts of the AMP Classes are the so-called philosophical legacy of Alexander Piatigorsky. After Piatigorsky's death in 2009 until the present day, Egor Shuppe has curated and supported the works of the philosophical and creative legacy of the philosopher. For this purpose, he has created the Fund of Piatigorsky's Heritage and issued philosophical Buddhist books of the philosopher and his novels.  Charity  Participated in the creation of Anton Nossik‚Äôs charity fund Pomogi.org.  Family  Divorced, father of four. Among his interests are philosophy, art and technologies.

The shooting took place after Harmon was pulled over by an officer for riding a bicycle without proper lighting. The incident led to protests in Salt Lake City, some organized by Black Lives Matter. Incident Harmon had been pulled over by police officer Kris Smith for bicycling without a red rear light. Officers tried to arrest Harmon after discovering an outstanding warrant. Harmon attempted to flee the scene and was chased by the police, at which point officers said he turned towards them with a knife and was shot. The shooting of Harmon by Fox was recorded by police body cameras. Police also stated that Harmon verbally threatened them prior to the shooting saying \\"I‚Äôll cut you\\". Harmon was tasered by Smith while or when on the ground after being shot by Fox. Aftermath The police and district attorney's office initially declined to release the body camera footage, prompting public protest in Salt Lake City. In early October 2017, some of the body camera footage was released, and the district attorney in Salt Lake City announced the decision not to file charges against the officers. The district attorney claimed that Harmon posed a threat to the officers. Critics have argued that the video footage from the scene does not show such a threat because he was running away when he was shot. A local Black Lives Matter representative said that the community wanted the district attorney to resign, or else they would respond with protesting marches. Salt Lake City police Sgt. Brandon Shearer claimed that the officers had used police de-escalation tactics. Fox was criticized by a Black Lives Matter representative, for failing to de-escalate the situation. Later in October 2017, following further public protests, the district attorney asked the FBI to review his decision not to prosecute the police involved.

Electricity regulation The CRU licenses and monitors electricity generators. On the transmission network, generally the high voltage lines deliver electricity from Ireland's generation sources to the transformer stations, where the electricity voltage is reduced and taken onwards through the distribution system to individual customers' premises. There are also about 18 very large commercial customers directly connected to the transmission system. EirGrid is the independent state-owned body licensed by the CRU to act as transmission system operator (TSO) and is responsible for the operation, development and maintenance of the system. The TSO also offers terms and levies charges to market participants for the connection to and use of the transmission system, which are regulated by the CRU. ESB Networks is licensed by the CRU as the owner of the transmission system and is responsible for carrying out the maintenance and construction of the system. The CRU sets the allowed revenue/tariffs for the transmission business and approves the connection policy for generators and suppliers connecting to and/or using the network. The Distribution Network is the medium and low voltage electricity network used to deliver electricity to connection points such as houses, offices, shops, and street lights. The Distribution Network includes all overhead electricity lines, poles and underground cables used to bring power to Ireland's customers. ESB Networks (a ring fenced subsidiary within the ESB Group) is the Distribution System Operator licensed by the CRU, responsible for the building, maintaining and operating the distribution network infrastructure. The Distribution Network is owned by ESB, the licensed Distribution Asset Owner. The CER sets the allowed revenue/tariffs for the distribution business and approves the connection policy for generators and suppliers connecting to and/or using the network. Supply The CRU licenses and monitors electricity suppliers. The CRU has overseen the gradual liberalisation of the electricity supply market which culminated in full market opening in February 2005. The regulatory framework created the right environment for competition to develop and since then competition has increased in the business and domestic markets. As a result, in 2010 the CRU published its Roadmap to Deregulation, which set out the milestones for the end of price regulation. All business markets were deregulated from 1 October 2010. Since April 2011 the domestic market has been deregulated, so all electricity suppliers may set their own tariffs without price regulation from the CRU. Single Electricity Market Since 1 November 2007, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, (known then as the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER)) and Utility Regulator, together referred to as the Regulatory Authorities or RAs, have jointly regulated the all-Island wholesale electricity market known as the Single Electricity Market (SEM). The SEM covers both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The decision-making body which governs the market is the SEM Committee, consisting of the CRU, the Utility Regulator as well as an independent member (who also has a deputy), with each entity having one vote. The detailed rules of the SEM are set out in the Trading and Settlement Code, which is overseen by the SEM Committee. At a high level, the SEM includes a centralised gross pool (or spot) market which, given its mandatory nature for key generators and suppliers, is fully liquid. In this pool electricity is bought and sold through a market clearing mechanism, whereby generators bid in the Short Run Marginal Cost (SRMC) and receive the System Marginal Price (SMP) for each trading period for their scheduled market quantities. Generators also receive separate payments for the provision of available generation capacity through a capacity payment mechanism, and constraint payments for differences between the market schedule and the system dispatch. Suppliers purchasing energy from the pool pay the SMP for each trading period along with capacity costs and system charges. Natural gas There are two types of gas pipelines operating around the country. The larger pipes which transport gas long distances are known as transmission pipes and the smaller pipes which bring gas from the transmission pipes to individual premises are known as distribution pipes. Ervia, formerly Bord G√°is √âireann (BGE), owns the transmission and distribution systems in the Republic of Ireland. Bord G√°is Networks (BGN) is the designated subsidiary within Ervia which constructs and extends the natural gas network in Ireland to the required safety standards. Gaslink is currently the TSO and DSO for gas. The CRU sets the allowed revenue/tariffs and connection policy for the gas transmission and distribution network (similar to electricity). It licenses and monitors gas suppliers. Since 1 July 2007 Ireland's retail gas market has been open to competition and all gas customers are eligible to switch their gas supplier. This represents over half a million domestic customers. It continues to regulate the revenue earned and tariffs charged by Bord G√°is Energy Supply to domestic customers, and works to resolve complaints that customers have with energy companies. Water regulation The CRU is the independent economic regulator for public water and wastewater services in Ireland. In the consultation process leading up to the introduction of water charges in Ireland, the CRU has proposed that Irish Water provide two products and one service, with each household receiving a maximum of one product (either \\"Water\\" or \\"Not for Human Consumption Water\\") at a time. It is proposed that the wastewater service be charged per unit product consumed.

After earning her teaching certificate in Ytriey she taught for three years and studied in Denmark, before applying to the Reykjav√≠k Junior College to further her education. Refused admittance, she moved back to Copenhagen and earned a Danish teaching degree. She studied at the Athens Classes to learn Greek and Latin and was admitted to graduate study at the University of Copenhagen. After her marriage, she abandoned her studies to work on the preparation of an Icelandic-Danish Dictionary, for the next two decades with her husband. When the dictionary was completed, his work was recognized and hers was not. Divorcing, she moved to Paris and attained a PhD, the first woman in Iceland to attain the distinction. Suffering from ill-health, she published until her death from breast cancer. Early life Bj√∂rg Car√≠tas √ûorl√°ksd√≥ttir was born in of Vestur-H√∫navatnss√Ωsla County, Iceland to Margr√©tar J√≥nsd√≥ttur and √ûorl√°ks S√≠monar √ûorl√°ksson Her mother raised the children, Sigurbj√∂rg, who would become a teacher; Magn√∫s, who was later a farmer; and J√≥n, who became the Prime Minister of Iceland, along with Bj√∂rg. Their father was farmer and the mayor of Vesturh√≥psh√≥lar and her maternal grandfather J√≥n Eir√≠ksson was the priest of Undirfell (is). She studied at the women's school at from 1891 to 1894, earning her teaching credentials. Career As soon as she graduated, Bj√∂rg began working as a teacher and taught for the next three years. In 1897, she went to Copenhagen with her brother J√≥n to further her education. She enrolled in the school taught by Natalie Zahle but left after a year and applied to study at the L√¶r√∞a sk√≥lanum (The Learned School) at the Reykjav√≠k Junior College. Her application was not approved and she remained in Copenhagen to finish her teaching degree. In 1900, she completed her degree from the Lyceum in Copenhagen and then attended courses at the Athens Classes to study Greek and Latin. She again applied to attend Reykjavik Junior College as a sixth year student, but was rejected because school policy allowed women to take a matriculation examination, but not attend classes. Instead, Bj√∂rg enrolled at N√∏rrebro's Latin and Real School (da) in Copenhagen, graduating with her bachelor's degree in 1901. The following year, she passed the PhD candidacy examination for the University of Copenhagen and enrolled in classes. In 1903, Bj√∂rg married Sigf√∫s Bl√∂ndal, a bookkeeper at the Royal Danish Library. Bj√∂rg took his name and became known as Bj√∂rg Bl√∂ndal. Together, they embarked on a project to create an Icelandic-Danish dictionary. The work took them nearly twenty years to complete, in part due to several bouts of illness. Bl√∂ndal was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1907 and spent most of 1908 in a tubercular hospital. She did not fully recover her health until 1911. In 1919, she was hospitalized at the state hospital in Copenhagen for lung cancer, but the tumor was found to be benign. When Konunglega b√≥kasafni√∞, was published in 1922, only her husband's work was recognized. Upon completion of the work, the couple's marriage fell apart and they filed for divorce. Sigf√∫s was granted an honorary doctorate from the University of Iceland in 1924, but Bj√∂rg was not. She took the name Bj√∂rg C. √ûorl√°ksson (Bj√∂rg C. Thorl√°ksson) and moved to Paris. Her divorced was finally granted in 1925, by which time, √ûorl√°ksson was studying at the Sorbonne. √ûorl√°ksson prepared her thesis, Le fondement physiologique des instincts des syst√®mes nutritif, neuromuscular et genital (The physiological basis of the instincts of the nutritive, neuromuscular and genital systems), which evaluated whether instinct was prompted by biology. She graduated in 1926 as the first Icelandic woman to achieve a doctorate degree. In 1928 the tumors returned and she underwent radiation therapy in Paris. She was put in an asylum, against her will, as it was believed she was suffering from delusions. Death and legacy √ûorl√°ksson died of breast cancer on 25 February 1934 in Copenhagen. In 2000, sculptor √Åsmundur Sveinsson created a bust of √ûorl√°ksson to be installed in her honor at the University of Iceland. In 2001, Sigr√≠√∞ur D√∫na Kristmundsd√≥ttir (is) published a biography of √ûorl√°ksson, Bj√∂rg: √Üvisaga Bjargar C. √ûorl√°ksson (Bj√∂rg: Life story of Bj√∂rg C. √ûorl√°ksson) with JPV Publishing.

The members of the movement advocate for the legitimate heir to the Senussi Crown Prince Mohammed El Senussi, son of Crown Prince Hasan as-Senussi and nephew of late King Idris, to lead Libya according to the provisions of the 1951 Constitution. Tripoli‚Äôs Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy, which has been active for a number of years, is part of the nationwide Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy in Libya which is also active in Tobruk, Zliten, Jebel Akhdar and Misurata.  Campaign for constitutional legitimacy  The members of the movement in Tripoli view the 1951 Constitution as the basis for establishing national sovereignty and returning stability to the Libyan homeland. The movement in Tripoli has been active for several years and has had a social media presence on Facebook since early 2014. In 2014 it proclaimed: > \\"The movement for the return to constitutional legitimacy provides a vision > aimed at stabilizing the political situation in the country, based on the > return of constitutional legitimacy with the inherent right to establish the > nation and unity, as approved by the founding fathers and grandfathers of > the independent state of Libya [‚Ä¶] with the return of constitutional > legitimacy, a minimum level of consensus can be found between all the forces > and components of the Libyan people.

On January 25, 2017, it posted that the draft national constitutional entitlement \\"which represents a political solution to the Libyan crisis\\" would be announced on January 26. In December 2016, the movement proclaimed: > \\"All Libyans must loudly claim to activate the Constitution of Independence > and to invite the rightful heir [‚Ä¶] and Crown Prince Hassan Mohammed Rida > al-Mahdi al-Sanusi to receive full constitutional duties to save our country > [‚Ä¶] and save the country from division and stop the bleeding of the Libyan > people.\\" On December 6, 2016, it shared a collection of photos from a peaceful march in the Algiers Square of Tripoli to demand the return to constitutional legitimacy and for Prince Mohammed El Senussi to \\"receive full constitutional powers as the king of Libya.\\" In February 2016, the movement said it had attended a four-hour-long meeting with the General National Congress of Libya to present the initiative to return to constitutional legitimacy. In December 2014, the movement held a peaceful demonstration for the reestablishment of the 1951 Constitution and a conference at a hotel in El-Bayda, attended by politicians, businessmen, academics and tribal leaders in Barqa. The same month, it shared photos from a meeting with the Mayor of Tripoli, Mr. Mahdi Abdul Hamid Al-Harati to strengthen national unity and rally support for the 1951 Constitution. In April 2014, it announced its first Board of Directors meeting in the Zawiyat Al-Dahmani district.  Prince Mohammed El Senussi  The movement refers to Crown Prince Mohammed El Senussi as \\"the holder of constitutional legitimacy\\" and advocates for his reinstatement as leader of Libya. It frequently shares press releases and speeches by the Prince himself commenting on important matters of the Libyan state. On August 9, 2017, the movement shared a statement by Prince Senussi honoring the seventy-seventh anniversary of the establishment of the Libyan army. It circulated a press release from Prince Senussi who cautioned political leaders and their international sponsors that lifting the arms embargo on Libya could lead to more conflict and extremism.

He was depicted in an Illustrated London News article of the time and was the subject of a letter published in several newspapers.  Early career  Traill was born in Lisburn, County Antrim, on 15 July 1793 the son of the Venerable Anthony Trail (1755‚Äì1831) and his wife, Agnes Watts Gayer.https://www.geni.com/people/Agnes- Traill/6000000020659843568 He earned the degree of Doctor of Divinity and afterward, in 1832, was appointed the rector of Schull, County Cork. He antagonised some local people with his fervent evangelical Christianity. He translated some of the manuscripts of Josephus, a first-century Jewish historian, into English. In 1840 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Thomas Stewart Traill. As an \\"ordinary\\" fellow this indicates his physical presence in Edinburgh at that time, possibly to visit his cousin. He probably stayed with Traill at his grand townhouse, 10 Albyn Place on the Moray estate.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1840 Traill is said to have discovered copper at the Dhurode mine on Mizen Head which first operated between 1844 and 1846. He was a major shareholder in the mine and one of its six shafts was named after him. Traill was involved in the Tithe War, in which many Roman Catholics refused to pay tithes for the evangelical established Church of Ireland, a fellow clergymen was killed within 30 miles of Schull, and Traill lamented that \\"the ungodly are rising up, and these poor deluded Roman Catholics are caballing to deprive me of my tithes, alas! What wickedness is this?\\".  Great famine  At the outbreak of the Great Famine in 1845 Traill believed that the ventilation of the traditional storage of potatoes in pits would save them from the blight, and he worked on constructing these potato pit air shafts from October 1845. However he realised this would not be successful and by December was trying, in vain, to persuade the local landlords to let their tenants keep some grain so that they weren't forced to eat their seed potatoes. Traill established a relief committee for his parish and wrote widely to persuade people to subscribe to it. He was shown in the Illustrated London News visiting a dying man and his family, having been sketched by James Mahony who said of Traill that \\"his humanity at the present moment is beyond praise\\". Traill established a soup kitchen at his home to provide for the needy and wrote that \\"my house is more like a beleaguered fortress. Ere the day has dawned the crowds are already gathering. My family one and all are perfect slaves worn out with attending them; for I would not wish, were it possible, that one starving creature would leave my door without some-thing to allay the cravings of hunger\\". In February 1847 he showed Commander James Crawford Caffin of HMS Scourge some of those in the parish affected by the famine. Caffin wrote to a friend that \\"In no house that I entered was there not to be found the dead or dying ... never in my life have I seen such wholesale misery, nor could I have thought it so complete.\\" Caffin's letter was published in various newspapers, an act which brought some relief efforts from the British Government to Schull. However by March this appeared to have ended when Traill stated \\"the distress was nothing in Captain Caffin's time compared with what it is now\\". Traill is said to have spent most of his income on relief for the needy. Death and legacy Traill died of \\"famine fever\\" (typhus) on 21 April 1847. Family He was married to Anne Hayes (d.1890).https://www.geni.com/people/Anne- Traill/6000000020659164231 He left a large family including two sons, three- year-old Robert Walter Traill and baby Edmund. The family moved to Dublin, where Robert studied civil engineering and Edmund medicine at Trinity College before they abandoned their studies to become ranchers in Argentina. Robert Walter Traill's son was Johnny Traill, the noted polo player. Another of Traill's grandsons was John Millington Synge, the playwright. His great-great- great granddaughter is TV producer and writer Daisy Goodwin. Goodwin wrote Traill into an episode of ITV's Victoria which told the story of the Great Famine, portraying a fictional meeting between the two. Traill was played by Martin Compston.

It is located in the eastern portion of the Centennial Mountains. Sawtell Peak is located in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest roughly east of Idaho's border with Montana. The summit is located near Henrys Lake and Big Springs, headwaters of the Henrys Fork of the Snake River as well as Brower's Spring, headwaters of the Missouri River, both of which being located near the Continental Divide. It was named after Gilman Sawtell, who settled the Island Park area in 1868. There are two ridges, the north one being much less accessible. Sawtell Peak is the starting point of the easiest route to climb nearby Mount Jefferson. Geology Sawtell Peak is the easternmost peak in the Centennial Range, which run east to west, contrary to many other fault block ranges in the Basin and Range Province. This east to west structure is likely due to movement with the Yellowstone Hotspot. The mountain and surrounding area is covered by block lava flows that are approximately thick on top of underlying strata from the Paleozoic era. This strata is by cut by feeder dikes. North of Sawtell Peak and the Centennial Range are canyons that were once heavily glaciated. Flora and Fauna The surrounding area contains the same wildlife as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The lower reaches of Sawtell Peak contain meadows filled with sagebrush and native grasses. Evergreen forests fill the midsection of it, with flowers blooming toward the end of summer. Some of these flowers include Indian paintbrush, western columbine, and varieties of sunflower. Big game such as white tail deer can be found in the forest on slopes of Sawtell Peak. There are also birds, such as western tanager and small game like the marmot. Grizzly bears can also be seen on occasion. Communication Sawtell Peak is used for communications for various agencies and organizations. The Federal Aviation Administration operates a long-range radar site that, since the September 11th attacks has been tied into the Joint Surveillance System. The radar is part of the Western Air Defense Sector, headquartered at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington. There is an amateur radio repeater near the summit that is linked to the Intermountain Intertie. This repeater provides coverage to portions of Yellowstone National Park, and the Intertie provides access to amateur radio operators to communicate as far south as Las Vegas, Nevada and Flagstaff, Arizona. Also near the summit is a translator for KBYI-FM, a radio station owned by Brigham Young University - Idaho and affiliated with National Public Radio. Recreation Sawtell Peak can be accessed by a heavily trafficked road leading from US 20 south of Henrys Lake. The road is about long and involves a climb from US 20 to the summit. The road can be dangerous, and at the high altitude, drivers could encounter abrupt snow storms. The snow can be up to deep and avalanches are a hazard. The road to the summit is closed from November 1 to June 1, but is maintained by the FAA. During the closure, the road is only accessible for personal associated with the communications facilities at the top. Snowmobiling is not allowed on the road. There are no roads or trails leading to the north summit. From the top, visitors can see Yellowstone, the Centennial Valley, the Teton Range in Wyoming and the Pioneer Mountains in Montana.

The ship's turbines were built by the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company, Wallsend, England, in 1907, and were capable of delivering a total 17,000 hp at 270 revolutions per minute. It had three 12-inch hollow-steel shafts, each carrying one propeller, with pitch of 105 inches, diameter of 115 inches. Steam was supplied by 13 cylindrical boilers, working at 180 lb pressure and fired by oil fuel only. The ships attained 21.6 knots on trial and 20 knots on ocean service. History Tenyo Maru was designed with ship building ideas of contemporary naval architecture throughout the world; its Japanese engineers visited shipyards internationally and adopted the best ideas they found. It took the place of the Nippon Maru,San Francisco Call, Volume 103, Number 83, 21 February 1908 built by Sir J. Lang of Sunderland, England in 1898, which was 421 feet long, 50 feet 7 inches wide and 29 feet 7 inches deep.San Francisco Call, Volume 84, Number 94, 2 September 1898 Tenyo Maru was launched in 1908 from Nagasaki, Japan, as the first Turbine Steam Ship built for trans-Pacific passenger service.

On September 27, 1910, while en route from Hong Kong to San Francisco, via Yokohama and Honolulu, Tenyo Maru ran aground thirty miles from Shanghai. The ship was floated at high tide with the aid of tugboats, without serious damage, and was able to continue its voyage.Sacramento Union, Number 37, 28 September 1910 In February 1913, Tenyo Maru weathered a storm which began 3 days into the voyage and lasted 6 days, which destroyed the ship's gangway, and smashed its rails; at times, the waves dashed over the smoke stacks. The 115 first and second class passengers were kept below decks while the captain made the decision to ride out the storm by heaving to, which was very unusual in a large steamship.Sacramento Union, Number 45, 14 February 1913 In 1921, the ship was fumigated due to a first- class passenger who became suddenly ill and died June 28 while en route from Nagasaki to Kobe. The passenger had bubonic plague. The cause was determined to be exposure to infected fleas from rats aboard the vessel.Annual Report of the Surgeon General of the Public Health service of the United States, for the fiscal year 1922. Page 166. Tenyo Maru was the ocean liner that carried the Japanese Friendship Dolls from Yokohama to San Francisco in 1927. It also carried opium and contraband. When Tenyo Maru arrived in San Francisco on July 9, 1929, passenger Sui'e Ying Kao, wife of the Chinese Vice Consul, requested that her baggage be passed and delivered at once, claiming diplomatic immunity from Customs inspection. The agents did not agree, broke the seals, opened the trunks, and found 2,300 cans of opium (about 1,000 pounds), worth about $600,000, making it a very large seizure by contemporary standards.\\"National Affairs: Mrs. Kao's Catastrophe,\\" Time Magazine, Monday, July 22, 1929 The ship was scrapped in 1933 and is not the same ship as the similarly named Japanese fishing vessel Tenyo Maru which collided with the Chinese freighter Tuo Hai within Canadian Territorial waters on July 22, 1991, causing a serious oil spill.

The company also offers several models of cyclocross and adventure-touring bikes. The firm filed for bankruptcy in November 2017. In February 2018, the firm was acquired by Emersion International Limited (EIL). History Niner was founded in 2005 by Chris Sugai and Steve Domahidy. Chris currently serves as the company's president and CEO. Since the company's inception, Niner has primarily focused on designing mountain bikes with 29‚Äù wheels (commonly referred to as \\"29ers\\" in the mountain biking community). According to Sugai, Niner's first bike was a scandium single-speed 29er. As the popularity of 29er mountain bikes began to grow during the late-2000s and early-2010s, the Niner brand also began to grow. In 2011, the Niner bike company was recognized by Forbes (‚ÄúList of America‚Äôs Most Promising Companies‚Äù). Originally headquartered in California, Niner moved its primary base of operations to a 39,000-square-foot building in Fort Collins, Colorado in 2016. In November 2017, Niner Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection ahead of a planned acquisition by an investor group. Several months later, in March 2018, Niner announced they had been acquired by UWHK Ltd., a Hong Kong-based investment firm known for owning Huffy Corp. Niner is a supporter of the International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA). Design and Manufacturing As of 2012, Niner bikes are designed in SolidWorks, and virtually tested and simulated using CATIA, including virtual strength and stress analysis. Manufacturing of Niner bikes takes place in Asia. The brand has more than 300 dealers across the United States and Niner bikes are sold in 40 countries. Carbon Compaction System Several Niner models now feature a new proprietary manufacturing process called Carbon Compaction System, which utilizes rigid internal molds. According to the company, this creates a tighter, more consistent compaction of carbon layers, resulting in increased wall thickness precision, reduced resin pooling, and increased strength. Industry Collaboration Niner recently collaborated with Push Industries, a Northern Colorado company specializing in bike suspension parts, to develop a customized shock specifically for the RIP 9 RDO. Products As of 2017, the range of complete bikes available from Niner includes full-suspension mountain bikes, hardtail mountain bikes, cyclocross bikes, and adventure-touring bikes (also called \\"gravel bikes\\"). The company also offers a selection of bike components, including frame parts, forks, wheels, handlebars, and seat posts.

Francis Harold Brown (October 24, 1943 ‚Äì September 30, 2017) was an American geologist and geochemist who mapped the sedimentary sequence and geology of most of the Turkana Basin in Kenya, east Africa. Brown introduced single-crystal argon-argon and potassium-argon dating into the Turkana Basin, resolving disputes over the age of Kenyanthropus platyops and other fossils. Early life Brown was born in Willits, California, to Vivien Clarice Jameson Brown and carpenter and viticulturist Francis Edward Brown. As an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, he studied chemistry, Latin and linguistics, rowed, and spent one obligatory year in the ROTC. Brown ultimately chose to pursue studies in geology and acquired his BA in 1965. He opposed the Vietnam war but reported to his draft board when he realized he had failed to register. Brown was not drafted. Early career in the Omo Brown began his doctoral work at Berkeley studying under Garniss Curtis. In 1966 anthropologist Francis Clark Howell sent Brown to the Omo Valley in southern Ethiopia, to study the chronology of sediments there containing early hominin remains. Brown entered Ethiopia by land rover from Turkana, but became ill with malaria. He would later state that he became deeply attached to Kenyan culture after retracing his steps and finding help at the military outpost of Lokitaung. Brown continued work in the Omo until a military coup in 1974 forced researchers from Ethiopia. For a brief period after his work in Ethiopia, Brown served on a U.S. scientific delegation attempting to normalize relations with China. Research in Turkana Brown worked to map sedimentary sequences in a number of neighboring countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Libya, and while studying geology in these different regions Brown observed that some volcanic tuffs were spread over vast geographic distances. In the course of his work Brown came to learn numerous East African languages including Swahili, Kikuyu, Amharic, Turkana and Daasanach. Brown was also an expert in the botany and history of the region. At the request of paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey, Brown began collaborating closely with Richard, Meave Leakey, and geochemist Ian McDougall to date volcanic ash layers in sedimentary sequences in the Turkana Basin. Brown initially worked on the fossil-rich northeastern portions of the lake, and his work resolved difficulties that had arisen in the interpretation of sediments at Koobi Fora. The project of systematically mapping ash layers and documenting their chronology was conducted in collaboration with geochemist Thure Cerling. Brown's efforts helped to date important hominin fossils including the Australopithecus \\"Lucy\\", Turkana Boy, and the specimen Kenyanthropus platyops. Because of his work Brown was presented to Queen Elizabeth II in London in 1985. University of Utah Brown became a professor of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Utah in 1971, and began to chair the department in 1988. Beginning in 1991, he served as Dean of the University of Utah College of Mines and Earth Sciences for 25 years. In 2001 the University honored Brown with the Rosenblatt Prize for Excellence.

Kitto began playing the guitar at the early age of seven, and participated as a contestant in a children's national television variety show Young Talent Time. At the age of 18 she performed her first paid concert for $40 and a cheese platter. In early adulthood, she joined the Royal Australian Navy, and later worked as an auto electrical mechanic. She was writing songs in her spare time and her first national airplay was an advertisement jingle 'Stepping out in Style' for Opal Menswear, which caught the attention of a Melbourne booking agent Terry Blamey. In the late 1980s Kitto was doing session vocals and studio work for Australian bands, The Gypsies, Cattletruck and Chantoozies.

She appeared in the Australian edition of Who's Who of Rock & Roll (Moonlight Publishing, 1993) and her songs featured in the TV series 'Home and Away'. However, as Kitto wanted to avoid the female rock clich√© and pursue her career as a freelance songwriter, it eventually led to a parting of the ways between her and Mushroom Records. She continued her career as an independent artist with The Harbour Agency, performing at various clubs in Sydney, and also opening up for artists such as Billy Thorpe, Diesel, Ian Moss, Richard Clapton, Jon Stevens, Mark Seymour and Nathan Cavaleri. Kitto also encountered a surprise meeting with Metallica's tour manager Tony Smith from Q-Prime Mgmt and shook hands with James Hetfield himself who had scouted two of her shows and surprised her with tickets to Metallica's Sydney concert in the summer of 1994. They both gave her a Q-Prime business card to pursue contact which she lost somewhere in her travels and had never forgotten since. Jeff 'Skunk' Baxter (Steely Dan, Doobie Brothers) spotted her in a solo show in Sydney one evening and invited her to join him in the US to play and co-write songs. She moved to Los Angeles in 1994, and performed in various music clubs, including Whisky a Go Go and The Roxy Theatre, but when her visa expired she returned to Australia. 1995 ‚Äì 2004 1995 Kitto recorded her first independent EP 20 Jacksonia. She was then invited to travel to Europe which included an appearance on a Swedish TV show, 'Good Morning Sweden' TV4 performing Jason, a song about a street musician whom she developed a friendship jamming alongside him on the streets of Sydney after her shows had finished bringing alongside her audience entourage. Kitto began spending more time around Scandinavia under the guidance of booking agent and later manager J√∂rgen Wiking who had her performing at various Nordic festivals e.g. V√§stervik Visfestivalen, Peace and Love, Midtfyn Festival in Denmark, Puistoblues in Finland and The Scandinavian Guitar Festival. She also joined the bill with numerous touring acts such as Joey Tempest(Europe) and Wilson Pickett and also made a guest appearance on Sweden's Triple & Touch TV show. She recorded an EP titled Jane Kitto, of which her single Mary and Vimmi K received national exposure on SR Swedish Radio and television. 1997‚Äì99 Kitto toured with her live shows mainly in Germany and France with her new band Baby Porcelain along with US co-writer Tim Tate and French drummer Frank Bessard.

Kitto recorded another album titled Over Sensitive in Los Angeles with producer Michael Vail Blum alongside session musicians, bassist Johnny Griparic(Slash's Snakepit), guitarist Dean Pleasants(Suicidal Tendencies) and drummer Simon Runge. Several songs were written by Kitto and long time friend South African songwriter colleague Andrew McDonald, who later went on to become her manager. The album was mixed and mastered later that year back in Sweden by a young producer, composer and guitarist for a folk metal band Netherbird, Pontus (Pna) Andersson in Sweden. Entrepreneur Asher Hayley from a UK label Green Pepper Junction working together with London based label Right Recordings signed Over Sensitive to a license deal and it was released in 2007. The meeting with Andersson proved long lasting consequences. After Over Sensitive was completed, the two had developed such a strong working relationship so Kitto asked him to accompany her as her guitarist at Maryport Blues Festival in the UK when she was billed alongside headliner Tony Joe White. In the same year, Kitto composed a soundtrack along with author Lauren St John for a film based on St John's book The White Giraffe, called Last Place You Look, and the song was recorded under the guidance of Andersson at his studios.

Her novels include The Weak and the Strong (1952), which tells the story of an Italian-American family living in New York during the Great Depression, and Final Proof (1971), a novel about the death of a publishing empire. She published several plays and received a Ford Foundation grant for playwriting. She also wrote for television, and in 1968 received the Hallmark Television Award. The Weak and the Strong was one of the earliest novels about growing up as the daughter of Italian immigrants; it defied the stereotypes of \\"happy-go-lucky\\" Italian family life. When it was first published, critics called it \\"bleak,\\" \\"unrelenting,\\" and \\"humorless.\\" In The Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian American Women (1985), Helen Barolini suggests that this was largely due to critics' expectations of Italian-American writers, and of women in particular; for a male writer such as Pietro di Donato, or an established woman writer such as Flannery O'Connor, she writes, \\"that kind of unsentimentality would be verismo of the highest order.\\" In 1974, Savarese was one of the few women included in Rose Basile Green's pioneering study of Italian-American writers.

Written by Kim Deal and Richard Presley, it was released on October 3, 2017, via 4AD, as the lead single from an upcoming seven-inch series. The song marks the first new music from the band since 2009, when they released their EP Fate to Fatal. Background On September 19, 2017, the Breeders teased the song by posting a 10-second clip on Twitter, in which \\"a rhythmic guitar riff and exclamations of 'Good morning!'\\" can be heard. Kelley Deal, lead guitarist of the Breeders, said of first reuniting for the recording sessions: \\"Everyone is the f***ing same! And it's bizarre. And a little bit embarrassing.\\" Critical reception Caryn Ganz of The New York Times wrote that the song \\"sounds less like the spacier explorations of the Deals' 2008 album 'Mountain Battles' and more like the crispy rock of the band's 1990 debut, 'Pod.'\\" Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone deemed the song \\"a classic Breeders bruiser\\" that is \\"packed with punchy drums, sugar-rush power chords and lead riffs\\". Winston Cook- Wilson of Spin believes that the song is \\"a typically energetic, wry, angular rocker\\". Stephen Thompson of NPR called the song \\"a blurt of jolting joy that opens with a welcome exclamation ‚Äî \\"Good morning!\\" ‚Äî before rumbling through two minutes of sunny menace\\". Lisa Nguyen of Paste felt \\"The Breeders keep the '90s alive with the spunky new track\\" and that the song \\"invigorates its listeners with punchy guitar riffs and quirky lyrics\\". She praised Kim Deal for ranging her vocals \\"from soothing oohs to aggressive exclamations\\". Under the Radar opined that the song \\"continues in the band's peerless tradition of urgent hooks and angelic vocals from sisters Kim and Kelley Deal\\", calling it a \\"miniature pop punk anthem\\". Robin Murray of Clash thinks the song is \\"hair- raising, fantastic alt rock as only The Breeders can provide\\". Gabriela Claymore of Stereogum described the song as \\"short, razor-sharp and funny\\", writing that it is \\"the kind of spunky and energizing song we've come to expect from this great band\\". Rachel Kraus of Mashable wrote: \\"On 'Wait in the Car,' The Breeders' signature sound is back. It's brash, sexy, and rebellious like the best of band (as in the hit single 'Cannonball.')\\" Artistdirect wrote that the song \\"features hard rocking with defiant lyrics\\", regarding it as \\"a continuation of the band's 90's edge\\". Julian Marszalek of Gigwise felt the song \\"contains all the right ingredients for The Breeders at their best\\", including \\"some stop-start riffing, gnarly guitars, a superbly ramshackle approach that suggests that the whole thing could fall apart at any second, cooing vocals and more hooks than a fisherman's bag\\". Dan Oberbruner of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote: \\"'Wait in the Car' is as unstoppably buoyant as the best tracks from their nearly three-decade long career\\". Music video The accompanying music video was directed by Chris Bigg and Martin Masai Andersen, who also compiled the song's cover art. It features over 800 images of \\"subjects ranging from song lyrics to abstractions of bricks\\". Bigg and Andersen explained the thought process behind the video in a statement: \\"It all started with a brick. We both liked the idea of using something iconic yet quite banal. An old brick has a story, and it's a beautiful raw object. We started collecting more and more (some intact, some broken) and realized how different they all appear, each one having its own identity.\\" Winston Cook- Wilson of Spin called the visual \\"a rapid-fire slideshow featuring bits of lyrics, abstract images, and distorted images of the band\\".

It was intended to be an installment of the X-Men film series. Before its cancellation, the film had been written by Josh Zetumer based on a story by the character's creator Chris Claremont. Channing Tatum was set to star in the title role. Tatum was looked at for early attempts to include Gambit in the X-Men films but was not available for that character's film introduction in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009). Taylor Kitsch portrayed the character instead, but was not well received. Producer Lauren Shuler Donner expressed interest in a Gambit film starring Tatum in early 2014, and the actor officially signed on that May. The film had been in development hell since then, with Rupert Wyatt, Doug Liman, and Gore Verbinski attached as director to the film at different times over the years and the film's release date also pushed back numerous times. Gambit was scheduled for release on March 13, 2020, but development of the film was placed on hold due to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney. After taking over the film, Disney cancelled it in May 2019.  Early development  Producer and star Channing Tatum promoting Gambit at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con For the 2003 film X2, director Bryan Singer asked stunt double James Bamford to film a short cameo as the character Gambit. The scene was ultimately cut from the film, and Bamford believed that a better known actor would be cast in the role for any future appearance. Singer wanted the character to have a large part in the sequel, X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), with Keanu Reeves in the role, but ultimately did not return to direct that film. A new writing team of Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn were set to write the sequel's screenplay by 20th Century Fox after Singer's departure, and though the pair wanted to include the character, they felt there was only room for a cameo appearance given the number of new characters more relevant to the film's storylines. They decided to save Gambit for a larger role in a future film. Before that decision was made, Josh Holloway had been looked at for the part but was unavailable due to the filming schedule of his series Lost. Channing Tatum was then chosen for the role, but the character was written out of the script before he was officially cast. By October 2007, Gambit was believed to be appearing in the spin-off film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, set for release in 2009. Tatum was unable to re-commit to the part at that time because of scheduling conflicts with G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009), and Taylor Kitsch was ultimately cast in the role. Kitsch signed a three-picture deal. Fox executive Jeff Katz was confident that the character would be well received, saying, \\"there is a level of strategy in how we grow these things, and what characters can transition between multiple films\\", indicating that the character could move on to his own standalone film as was the plan with Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool. However, Wolverine was not well received by critics, and Kitsch's performance did not make him the breakout hit that Fox executives had expected. In September 2013, Tatum expressed interest in taking over the role from Kitsch, saying, \\"Gambit's my favorite. I‚Äôm from New Orleans, around that area. My dad's from New Orleans, and I like to do a Cajun accent. I could do it for real. No knock on Taylor Kitsch, though, ‚Äôcause I actually like his Gambit, but I‚Äôve always lived around Cajun people ... Gambit was always like the woman-loving, cigarette-smoking, drinking [guy]. He was the punk rock of all the superheroes.\\" X-Men franchise producer Lauren Shuler Donner revealed in January 2014 that she had begun planning a Gambit film with Tatum. She said it \\"doesn't have to be a great big movie. It's a thief in New Orleans, it's a whole different story. [Tatum]'s on board, and I have to get the studio on board.\\" That May, Tatum officially signed on to star in a Gambit film that was intended to begin a new standalone franchise; he would first introduce his version of the character in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). By October, the producers were discussing the film's story and looking for a writer, with Josh Zetumer hired in the role at the end of the month, working off a story treatment by Gambit's comic creator Chris Claremont. Alongside Donner and Kinberg, Tatum was set to produce the film with Reid Carolin of their company Free Association. In January 2015, Fox gave the film an October 7, 2016 release date. Over several months, Tatum approached Bennett Miller, Darren Aronofsky, Gareth Evans, and J.C. Chandor to direct the film, but they all turned him down. In May, Zetumer completed his first draft of the script, which Tatum described as a \\"killer\\" origin story that changed \\"some of the tropes of these movies.\\"  Rupert Wyatt  In June 2015, Rupert Wyatt signed on to direct the film, with Tatum saying, \\"We finally found someone that I really do believe wants to make Gambit\\". Tatum added that the film was \\"a really unique opportunity\\" among superhero films, and was no longer set to appear in Apocalypse. He had begun learning to throw cards and sleight-of-hand tricks for the part from magician David Kwong, a friend of Carolin's from College. Filming was set to begin in New Orleans in late October or early November of that year. By the end of July, the film was believed to focus on \\"mobsters and thieves [rather than] 'end-of-the-world' stakes\\", but Fox also wanted to \\"load up on spectacle and make this character as popular as possible\\" with a large $154 million budget to be mostly spent in Louisiana. Several actresses were being tested for the female lead, including L√©a Seydoux. Tatum was renegotiating his contract with Fox at the end of July 2015, and was believed to be close to dropping out of the project due to Fox's intention to have Tatum become one of the \\"anchor characters\\" of the franchise following the impending retirement of Hugh Jackman as the series' former lead character Wolverine. This would be a major commitment for Tatum to make. Backend compensation was also an issue. Within days, the issues had been resolved and Tatum was once again set to star and produce; it was said that his \\"participation hardly was in any real danger\\" due to the commitments Tatum had already made to the project. Rebecca Ferguson and Abbey Lee were also testing for the \\"hotly contested\\" female lead of Belladonna Boudreaux, but Ferguson soon chose a role in The Girl on the Train (2016) instead. Seydoux was cast in the role by the end of August. In September, Wyatt left the film after changes to its schedule caused a clash with another project he was committed to. Wyatt was also believed to have become \\"skittish\\" about directing the film due to wanting to rewrite the script and \\"conceive the world that he is filming\\", leading to differences in opinion on the script with Fox, Tatum, and Kinberg. Wyatt later stated in March 2019, that he left the film because the studio \\"slashed [the budget] quite considerably\\" following the financial failure of Fantastic Four (2015), but was not willing to let the script be re-written to match the new budget before the beginning of production which then was around 10 weeks away.  Doug Liman  Doug Liman joined the film as director in November 2015, but left in August 2016 due to script concerns Fox began \\"furiously\\" meeting with potential replacements for Wyatt in hopes of keeping the film's release date, including directors Doug Liman, Joe Cornish, Shane Black, and F. Gary Gray. Liman was in final talks to take on the film in November 2015. He had already begun working on the screenplay with Tatum, Carolin, Zetumer, and Kinberg. The latter noted that the X-Men franchise was beginning to branch out into different tones with the irreverent, R-rated Deadpool (2016), and that \\"Gambit will have its own different flavor and tone to it, will be more like a heist movie and a sexy thriller in a way.\\" In January, filming was set for March 2016. Fox officially removed Gambit from its October release date in February 2016. Liman soon chose to direct the film The Wall (2017) while waiting for a new draft of the Gambit script, intending to then begin production on Gambit at the end of 2016. Tatum and Carolin were looking for a new writer to undertake the rewrite and pursue a different creative direction for the film, while Liman was expected to discard Wyatt's casting of Seydoux and begin casting from scratch himself. Kinberg explained in May that the group had collectively been unhappy with the film's script, but were now \\"very close\\" to completing it. He added that \\"the most important thing is getting the tone and the voice right ... [we are] hoping that Gambit is like what Deadpool was‚Äîthe start of a new franchise within the X-Men universe‚Äîwe want to make sure we get it right.\\" In July, Kinberg praised the script for Gambit and said that they were now aiming to begin filming at the beginning of 2017. However, Liman left the project the next month in a \\"mutual split\\" with Fox, choosing to instead direct the DC Comics-based film Dark Universe. Liman later explained that he is \\"all about the script, and I just wasn't feeling it. I've gotta connect to the script.\\"  Gore Verbinski  In November 2016, Gambit was expected to begin development again with a new director after Tatum completed work on the film Logan Lucky (2017). The next January, Donner confirmed that Tatum was still attached to the project, and a month later Kinberg described the film as being in \\"active development\\". He stated his hope for the project to be ready by the end of 2017, for filming to then begin at the start of 2018. He noted that there were already three X-Men franchise films set for release in 2018 at that point, so Gambit \\"can wait for a moment.\\" Kinberg compared Tatum's commitment to the role of Gambit to the determination shown by Reynolds and Jackman to get their most recent X-Men films (Deadpool and Logan (2017), respectively) made \\"right\\", and reiterated Fox's intention to build a new Gambit film franchise. Gore Verbinski joined the film as director in October 2017, but left in January 2018 due to a scheduling conflict and reported creative issues At the end of May 2017, X-Men producer Hutch Parker was unable to provide an update on the film, but said \\"there's still a desire and a passionate interest to see [Gambit] made.\\" Tatum reiterated that he was still actively working on the film in July, and discussed the long development period for the film and the many delays to the production, saying, > I think we got super, super lucky. I think a lot of setbacks, we'll look at > them in hindsight as giant blessings. Because we were making it, [and] we're > writing a movie right at the turn of a paradigm shift in movies. So we got > lucky that we didn't just come out with ours, which I don't think was fully > formed. It was a good idea. We were going in the right direction. And then > we got to learn from two really beautifully different kinds of a complete > paradigm shift [in] Logan and Deadpool. Tatum added the next month that work on the Gambit script had \\"started over\\", and that \\"we‚Äôre really getting to do some of the things we‚Äôve always wanted to do with the script\\" which he described as \\"something that this genre of movie hasn't seen before.\\" In October, Gore Verbinski was in talks to direct the film, which was described as a \\"high priority\\" for Fox. A week later, the film was given a February 14, 2019 release date, and Verbinski was confirmed to direct. By the end of the month, casting for the film was \\"well underway\\", and Jenny Beavan was hired as costume designer. The next month, Lizzy Caplan was in talks to join the film as its female lead, and location scouting for the film was taking place in New Orleans. By December, filming was set to begin in New Orleans in March 2018. The next month, Verbinski withdrew from the project due to a scheduling conflict, though creative differences were also reported. Fox subsequently moved the release date to June 7, 2019.  Re-development and cancellation  Despite initially intending to keep the March filming start following Verbinski's departure, Fox removed the film from its production schedule by the end of January 2018. At that time, the search for Verbinski's replacement was underway, while the new June 2019 release date was expected to play better for the film as a \\"summer Marvel movie\\". The film was described as having a comedic tone and revolving around a heist, and had also undergone a rewrite to make it \\"more New Orleans\\". Fox expected another new draft of the script in March, and still considered the film to be greenlit with a set budget despite the lack of director; a new production start date of June 19, 2018 was set, dependent on a new director being found in time. The producers met with several directors for the film during April 2018, with Kinberg stating in May that he and Tatum were happy with the current script for the project and hoped to pick a new director in \\"the next couple of weeks and shoot the movie maybe the end of this summer\\". He reiterated that the film was still a priority for Fox \\"believe it or not\\", and added that the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney did not affect their plans for the film at that point. In September, Fox was believed to be interested in starting production on February 15, 2019. The studio was still looking to shoot the film in New Orleans, and was looking to use Big Easy Studios for production space after doing the same for Logan. This new start date gave the studio time to hire a new crew for the film after previously hired crew members were let go. By the end of the month, Kinberg confirmed that they were now looking to being production on Gambit in early 2019. He described the film as being \\"loosely\\" a romantic comedy due to Fox wanting the tone of each X-Men spin-off to be driven by the protagonist's personality (such as Deadpools raunchy comedic tone and Logans western \\"vibe\\") and the character of Gambit being \\"a hustler and a womanizer and we just felt like there was an attitude, a swagger to him, that lent itself to romantic comedy\\". At that time, Fox delayed the release of the film again, pushing it to March 13, 2020. By then, Carolin was believed to have been working with Zetumer on the script. In October, Kinberg confirmed that the version of the film they were developing was significantly different from their earlier plans, which is why the tone had changed from a heist film to a romantic comedy. He elaborated that some of the heist elements remained in the film due to Gambit still being a thief, but the focus would be a love story between Gambit and Belladonna. Kinberg compared the new direction to Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), which he wrote, as well as The Philadelphia Story (1940) and His Girl Friday (1940). At that time, Daniel Woburn of Screen Rant opined that the film, which he described as being in development hell since 2014, was likely to be canceled once Disney's acquisition of Fox was complete since Marvel Studios would want to integrate the X-Men characters into their Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In January 2019, it was reported that Tatum was interested in directing the film along with starring. The next month, Donner revealed that Gambit, along with the rest of Fox's Marvel films, was \\"on hold\\" until Disney's acquisition of Fox was complete. A week after the acquisition was complete, Kinberg said the film was being evaluated by Marvel. In May 2019, Gambit was officially cancelled by Disney and removed from its release schedule. In May 2020, Kinberg revealed the character Mister Sinister would have featured in the film, after the Essex Corporation was teased in Apocalypse; Mister Sinister had previously been rumored at one point to feature in The New Mutants (2020).

Adapted from a Dutch television series, it revolves around a man or woman being chained to four members of the opposite sex over four days and nights. This person, identified as the \\"Picker\\", is given $10,000 and can remove three contestants one at a time. The Picker can give a portion of the money to each eliminated participant. When left with a single partner, the Picker can choose to either split the money or keep it. American television personality Madison Michele hosted each episode. Chains of Love was originally ordered by NBC, before UPN began producing it. The program was produced as part of a campaign to have more unscripted programming in UPN's schedule to boost the network's ratings. Media outlets have identified Chains of Love as part of a renaissance in reality television. David Garfinkle, who had previously worked on the show Blind Date, served as the executive producer. Before its premiere, UPN had promoted the series through a month-long online campaign aimed at young women. Initially broadcast on Tuesday nights at 8:00 pm EST, the network envisioned the show as a companion piece to the simulated fugitive-chase series Manhunt. Media outlets questioned whether the show's airing on network television had restricted its content. Critical feedback to Chains of Love was mixed, the show's premise dividing television critics. Its structure and tone were compared to other programs where contestants seek love partners, such as Blind Date and The Dating Game. Chains of Love has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or through online-streaming services.  Gameplay  alt=An image of four women and a man sitting on a couch in a living room. They are all chained together by the ankles. In each episode, five contestants are taken to a house in Palos Verdes Estates, California. Bound together by a six-foot chain, they are linked by their hands and feet in the \\"Ritual Room\\" by the \\"Lockmaster\\", played by a muscular man in a suit and sunglasses. The participants are kept less than 24 inches from each other during filming. The chaining of the contestants is not shown on-screen. The group includes a \\"Picker\\" and four potential suitors, referred to as \\"playmates\\". The four contestants are selected based on how their answers to questions in an earlier interview matched the qualities the Picker sought in a suitor. Both men and women have been Pickers; the four participants are always the opposite sex of the Picker. The group remains chained together for four days and nights and is taken to complete day-to-day tasks, such as grocery shopping, preparing food, and ice skating. There are certain times when individuals are allowed their privacy, including using the bathroom, bathing, and changing clothing. At the start of each episode, the Picker is provided with $10,000 to give to the other participants based on his or her personal preferences. The Picker eliminates potential matches, who are then unchained by the Lockmaster. As each contestant leaves, the Picker can decide to give a portion of the money to them. When one contestant remains, the Picker can choose to split the remaining cash with them if they feel that a \\"love connection\\" has been formed. The Picker can also choose to keep the money for themselves. The final contestant can refuse to be involved any further in a relationship. Production alt=An image of a woman with shoulder-length hair and a dark red outfit. She is speaking into a microphone with the words \\"TV Guide\\". Chains of Love was inspired by a television program from the Netherlands with the format being sold into Australia, Holland, the US, and the UK. (\\"E4\\" refers to the E4 (TV channel) in the UK.) The Dutch company Endemol handled the production,Magder (2004): p. 144 and David Garfinkle acted as the executive producer. Garfinkle had previously worked on the American dating game show Blind Date. It was also produced by people involved in the development of the reality game show franchise Big Brother.Brooks & Marsh (2009): p. 888 Garfinkle said that he was not certain how the series would unfold during its broadcast, explaining that the competition among the contestants began to resemble soap operas such as Melrose Place. American television personality Madison Michele hosted each episode. Chains of Love was initially picked up by NBC, in an agreement with Endemol where the network would produce nine episodes of an unidentified program. NBC eventually decided not to pursue the series due to creative differences with its producer. Newsweek's Marc Peyser believed that NBC dropped out of the project on \\"moral grounds\\" due to its premise. The network chose to adapt the Dutch show Now or Neverland into Fear Factor in place of Chains of Love. UPN began producing Chains of Love, along with three other reality television shows, as part of its extensive campaign to air more unscripted content on the network. The New York Times' Bill Carter identified the series as part of a \\"second wave of reality shows\\" that started from the success of the reality competition television franchise Survivor. Carter interpreted new reality programming as \\"designed to push the envelope of prime-time broadcasting\\" content. In her 2007 chapter \\"Models of (Im)perfection\\", writer Kimberly K. Bell wrote that Chains of Love contained a similar production style to Survivor; she commented that both shows are set in \\"elaborately structured playing fields\\", in which producers edit the contestant's identity to better appeal to an audience.Bell (2007): p. 30 UPN executives associated the rise in interest in unscripted content as connected to its low production costs compared to scripted programming and its appeal to a younger demographic. Network president Dean Valentine explained: From a societal view, audiences, especially young people, are finding it harder and harder to relate to fictional storytelling ‚Äì it just seems fake to them. The network's entertainment chief Tom Nunan said the series was intended to improve the network's ratings, explaining: \\"There's a wave of television viewer right now that is very clear to us ‚Äì it shows that audiences seem to be responding to these event programs that don't feel like cookie-cutter TV.\\" Interpreting the titular chains as \\"metaphors for the bonds of human affection\\", Valentine found the series was primarily an example of physical comedy. He emphasized that the show was not directly related to sadomasochism. Valentine said that the show's appeal would extend beyond sexuality, identifying the contestants as \\"kind of morph[ing] together [as] they have to deal with acceptance, rejection, fear, need\\". He explained that the process was \\"so emotional and stripped down [that] you almost feel like you're watching an est session\\". Episodes Broadcast history Chains of Love was one of three series that debuted on UPN during the 2000‚Äì01 US television schedule as a mid-season replacement; the other two were Special Unit 2 and All Souls. Chains of Love was broadcast initially on Tuesday nights at 8:00 pm EST, premiering on April 17, 2001. UPN picked it up originally as a companion piece to the 2001 Manhunt, in which pretend fugitives ran away from actors posing as bounty hunters. During its broadcast, Chains of Love was briefly paired with All Souls, which UPN placed on a hiatus after two episodes were aired. Before the show's debut, the network had conducted a month-long online promotional campaign. The advertisements, specifically aimed at women from the ages of 12 to 34 years old, appeared on the websites Targetmatch.com, Madhive.com, and Ecrush.com. The Marina del Rey-based marketing firm L90, who had previously done work for UPN for the series Gary & Mike, created the campaign. Lauren Kay, the company's vice president of marketing, said that for the show they put together a \\"clean simple branding program\\" using pop-up ads, flash animation, and a sweepstake done through a microsite. Media outlets questioned whether the show's broadcast on network television had a limited impact on its more mature content. Carman identified a scene as confusing in which the Picker suggested skinny-dipping in a hot tub to the four women, followed by a shot of them appearing in swimsuits. Peyser equated the sexual content with that of Dawson's Creek, and wrote that it was not as explicit as he had first imagined. UPN canceled Chains of Love after its six-episode season. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available through online-streaming services. Following the show's cancellation, William Shatner and Valentine parodied it during an event at Madison Square Garden, where they appeared chained together.Caldwell (2008): p. 100 Critical reception On its debut, Chains of Love received primarily negative feedback from television critics. Equating the concept to \\"televised prostitution\\", the Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Rob Owen wrote that the program represented the worst aspects of television, and did not believe it would have even a guilty- pleasure appeal for viewers. A writer for The Augusta Chronicle described the series as an embarrassment for the network. In his 2005 book From Daytime to Primetime: The History of American Television Programs, scholar James W. Brown felt the concept fostered an environment for emotional and physical abuse.Roman (2005): p. 178 Some commentators had more positive comments for the series. Even though he heavily panned the show for lowering contestants' dignity to attract viewers, the San Francisco Chronicle John Carman wrote that he was interested in watching how each of the men would approach the situation differently. Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson described it as \\"the most bizarre and captivating reality series in TV history\\" due primarily to its premise. Chains of Love was often compared to other television shows. Due to the series' emphasis on gender relations as part of its game theory, Brown identified Chains of Love as descendant of The Dating Game and Anything Goes (a show featuring strip poker). Marc Peyser of Newsweek wrote that the producers of the series maintained the same irreverent tone from Blind Date. Later dating shows, Elimidate Deluxe and Tethered, were described as borrowing elements from Chains of Love,Bell (2007): p. 26 specifically the concept of having a contestant go on a date with four individuals and binding people together to complete specific tasks.

The leaves have the 5 distinctive longitudinal veins (nerves) typical of plants in the family Melastomataceae. Description Melastoma septemnervium are erect shrubs or small trees up to 5 m tall. Leaves are elliptical with short stiff hairs or scales on the upper surface and finer dense hairs on the lower surface but with a mixture of scales on the nerves. Distribution Native to Vietnam, southern China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Ryukyu Islands, and southern Japan. Cultivated and naturalized in Hawaii but also reported to be abundant and invasive on Kauai and Hawaii Island from sea level up to 900 m elevation. Melastoma septemnervium grows in light forests, clearings, and grass lands, or on rocky slopes, but prefers mesic to wet areas and bog margin habitats in Hawaii. Taxonomy Hawaiian populations of M. septemnervium were historically assigned to Melastoma malabathricum non L. but later were identified as M. candidum D. Don by Wagner et al. 1999 due to a number of consistently different traits, including a higher chromosome number (2n = 56 versus Melastoma malabathricum 2n = 24). M. septemnervium was first described by Loureiro in 1790 (Flora Cochinchinensis 1: 273‚Äì274). M. septemnervium is the accepted name by some sources with M. candidum as a junior synonym, but both names are used widely.
