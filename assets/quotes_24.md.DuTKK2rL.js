After studying civil law, Castiglione became a protonotary apostolic, gaining a reputation as a great canonist and sacred orator. Pope Eugene IV named him a secretary apostolic. On September 2, 1444, the cathedral chapter of Coutances Cathedral elected him Bishop of Coutances. In 1447, he was named papal legate to the Kingdom of England. He was transferred to the see of Pavia on October 3, 1453. He served as the papal legate of Pope Nicholas V and Pope Callixtus III to Germany, in which capacity he was present at the Diet of Regensburg of April 1454 and the Diet of Frankfurt of October 1454. At these two diets, his main goal was to promote war with the Ottoman Empire, which had recently captured Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. On September 8, 1455, he was present in St Mark's Basilica in Venice for the ceremony of the departure of the Crusade. In 1456, he served as legate to Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. At the request of Francesco I Sforza, Pope Callixtus III made Castiglione a cardinal in the consistory of December 17, 1456. Castiglione entered Rome on February 23, 1457; received the red hat in the public consistory of February 24, 1457; and received the titular church of San Clemente on March 9, 1457. Cardinal Castiglione participated in the papal conclave of 1458 that elected Pope Pius II. Pius named Castiglione legate a latere to the March of Ancona, and Castiglione left Rome on this assignment in September 1458. He occupied this post until his death. He also became commendatory abbot of the Basilica of Sant'Abbondio in 1458. Castiglione died in Macerata on April 14, 1460. He is buried in his family tomb in Milan.

History Commissary Building In the 1920s, Dr. William E. McNamara of Lansing, Michigan purchased of land in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. In 1927, McNamara organized the Hiawatha Sportsman's Club for the purpose of hunting, fishing, and relaxing in a relatively unspoiled environment. In the late 1920s, the population of Engadine, Michigan, was dwindling due to the description of the main industry in town. In 1931, the club purchased an empty Engadine store and moved it onto the club property to serve as a commissary. The first two commissary managers went on to found grocery stores in nearby towns: Joseph Patrick Rahilly in Newberry, Michigan, and Emmet Joseph Vallier in Naubinway, Michigan. The commissary is currently used by the Hiawatha Sportsman's Club Art Group for painting. Also in 1931, the club constructed a clapboard-covered frame structure nearby to use as a maintenance building. The building served as the maintenance center for the club until 1946; it was used for storage until the mid-1970s.

History In the 1920s, Dr. William E. McNamara of Lansing, Michigan purchased 32,000 acres of land in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. In 1927, McNamara organized the Hiawatha Sportsman's Club for the purpose of hunting, fishing, and relaxing in a relatively unspoiled environment. In 1930, the club, led by McNamara, put together a team or architects and contractors to construct a hotel on club property. The original design specified a hotel with 50 rooms and a screened porch long running along the front of the building. However, the Great Depression changed economic conditions, and the original design was scaled down to one containing 16 rooms, a lobby, and a screened porch. The final building included design elements from both Philadelphia architect George Bunn and Lansing architect Harold G. Benriter. The building was constructed in 1931, using logs cut on the club's property and limestone from a quarry also on the club's property. The limestone fireplace in the lobby was designed and constructed by Barryton, Michigan masons Lloyd, Martin and Lormer Eisenbach. The lodge served as a quiet facility for club members to stay at, in contrast to cabins on Lake Millecoquins that could also be rented. However, in 1962, the nearby dining hall burned down, and was not replaced. Members use of the lodge decreased. The lodge is currently used by the Hiawatha Sportsman's Club as a library and museum, and it is not open to the public. Description The Hiawatha Sportsman's Club's Manitou Lodge is sited on a bluff overlooking Naubinway and Lake Michigan. The lodge is \\"an excellent example\\" of log construction. It is still in original condition, and consists of a lobby and sleeping rooms. The main section is a gable-end structure with a low pitched roof, and contains the lobby. The lobby interior showcases exposed roof beams and a large limestone fireplace. A by screened porch runs along the south side of the building, and provides a view of the lake. Two gable-end wings on the north side, mirror images of each other, house the sleeping rooms.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description The Juntunen site is located on a low sand beach about 600 feet from and 17 feet above the current lakeshore. The site was a large seasonal fishing camp covering approximately . It was likely a seasonal fall fishing village similar to the nearby Scott Point Site. The site also contains five ossuaries, plus an infant burial and additional remains collected from the surface. The site was used during the Late Woodland period (c. 800 A.D.-1400 A.D.) The burials primarily dated from 1200 to 1400 AD. The frequent but seasonal occupation of the site led to a stratified layering of archaeological remains at the site, consisting of up to 25 separate layers. History The Juntunen Site was discovered in 1932 by Robert Braidwood of the University of Michigan, who found human remains eroding from the surface of a group of mounds. Excavations were carried out over the next few years. Mr. Charles Juntunen, the property owner of the site, discovered more remains in 1959 while bulldozing a road. Juntunen contacted The University of Michigan, and the University's Alan McPherron and James Griffin conducted multiple excavations from 1960-1963.  Results of 1960-1963 Excavations  Juntunen points Bone harpoons Bone awls The excavations yielded features, human burials, Prehistoric artifacts, animal bone, and plant remains. The excavators recorded 25 stratigraphic layers which represented 6 occupations and 3 phases with 2 Intermediate Phases where the site was apparently unoccupied for extended periods of time: * Mackinac Phase, c. 800 A.D. - 910 A.D., Occupations A and B, Stratigraphic Layers I-XIV * Intermediate I Phase, c. 910 A.D. - 1000 A.D., Occupation C, Stratigraphic Layer XV-XV * Bois Blanc Phase, c. 1000 A.D. - 1200 A.D., Occupation D, Stratigraphic Layers XVI-XIX * Intermediate II Phase, c. 1200 A.D. - 1250 A.D., Stratigraphic Layers XX-XXI * Juntunen Phase, c. 1250 A.D. - 1400 A.D., Occupations E and F, Stratigraphic Layers XXII-XXV Excluding the intermediate phases, the sequence is generalized as: Mackinac Phase, c. 800 A.D.-1000 A.D.; Bois Blanc Phase 1000 A.D.-1200 A.D.; Juntunen Phase 1200-1400 A.D.  Features  Features present at the site included hearths, pits (large and small) and animal burials (dog, snowshoe hare and bald eagle). Hundreds of post molds were found but except for the outlines of a longhouse, no other structures could be discerned.  Human burials  There were 65 burials, some of them in ossuaries. The presence of ossuaries is evidence of cultural practices which are documented in early Historic accounts of the Huron Feast of the Dead and similar ceremonies. 10 out of the 65 burials had a piece or plaque of bone from the cranium removed, a practice not seen in early Historic times.  Animal bone  The major species present were sturgeon, whitefish, beaver, bald eagle, dog (both as food and ceremonial burials), loon and walleye. Fully 85% of the bones belonged to fish species. These bones were unmodified, unlike the worked bone artifacts discussed in the “Artifacts” section, and are interpreted as food remains.  Plant remains  Several plant remains were recovered from the site, including birch bark, hazelnut, maize, fire cherry and blackberry. Juntunen marks the furthest northerly appearance of maize in the prehistoric archaeological record.  Artifacts  Partially reconstructed Mackinac Punctate vessels Partially reconstructed Mackinac Banded vessels Partially reconstructed Bois Blanc Braced Rim vessel Partially reconstructed Bois Blanc Braced Rim vessel with similarities to Blackduck pottery Partially reconstructed Juntunen Drag-and-Jab vessel Middle Mississippian Ramey Incised sherds Miniature children's vessel Artifacts recovered from the site included: * Pottery (101,477 sherds representing at least 631 vessels) * Stone tools including 245 scrapers and 198 projectile points (of which 133 were triangular Juntunen points as defined by the excavators) * Ground stone artifacts (11), including celts and adzes * Bone tools (120) - including 69 awls and 9 harpoon heads * Copper artifacts - Juntunen is the only known copper manufacturing site in the Late Woodland. Including wastage and raw materials, 776 copper artifacts were present. Of the finished products, the most common categories were awls (57) and beads (25) One individual buried in one of the ossuaries contained an unusual personal kit containing tools, skins, animal bones, a red stone tablet and a strike-a-light set. No other individuals had grave goods so it may be that this individual was prominent in the community or that we was a shaman or medicine man.  Late Woodland Occupations and Associated Pottery Types  Due to the extremely large sample size of pottery sherds, and the stratified nature of the site, the researchers were able to present a detailed record of cultural development and discern relationships with other regions. Three indigenous Late Woodland phases of pottery types were identified: Mackinac, Bois Blanc and Juntunen. In addition, 4 “foreign” pottery types were also present: Late Woodland Blackduck and Point Sauble, Upper Mississippian Oneota and Middle Mississippian Ramey ware. A few other pottery types were also present in trace amounts. Miniature vessels were also present at Juntunen (91 sherds representing at least 21 vessels). These are common at other sites in the area and could be interpreted as “toy” pots or attempts by young children to practice making pottery. = Mackinac Ware = 1,713 sherds were recovered, representing at least 631 vessels. This pottery is characterized by rounded, generally squat vessels with well-defined shoulders and tempered by coarse grit temper. Surface finish is generally cord-wrapped paddle impressed with decorations applied by cord-wrapped paddle or twisted cords and punctates. No collars or castellations appear during this phase. Similar pottery dating to the Late Woodland has been reported from the Heins Creek site in Wisconsin. Five types of Mackinaw Ware are defined: * Mackinac Undecorated - 299 rim sherds, representing at least 169 vessels. Characterized by undecorated surfaces and notched, splayed or outrolled lips. * Mackinac Punctate - 392 rim sherds, representing at least 157 vessels. Characterized by various types and patterns of decoration using punctates; lips are thickened and splayed or outrolled. * Mackinac Cord Impressed - 275 rim and decorated body sherds, representing at least 108 vessels. Characterized by patterns of horizontal or vertical bands of cord-wrapped stick impressions. * Mackinac Banded - 722 rim and decorated body sherds, representing at least 182 vessels. Characterized by horizontal bands of decoration produced by cord-wrapped stick and/or paddle, and punctates produced by a sharp tool. * Mackinac Zigzag Lip - 25 rim sherds representing at least 15 vessels. Characterized by thickened lips decorated in zigzag patterns by cord-wrapped object impressions. = Bois Blanc Ware = 793 sherds were recovered, representing at least 138 vessels. Characterized by rounded vessels lacking the well-defined shoulders of Mackinac Ware; cord-wrapped stick and twisted cord exterior decoration; lips thickened by either folding over the clay or addition of a clay strip; and castellated, straight to slightly everted rims. This pottery has similarities to other Late Woodland wares including Blackduck, Heins Creek and Point Sauble. Three types of Bois Blanc Ware are defined: * Bois Blanc Braced Rim - 496 rim and decorated body sherds, representing at least 108 vessels. Characterized by braced rims created by adding a strip or molding lip and rim. Rims are castellated and profiles straight to slightly excurved. Surface treatment similar to Mackinac Ware. * Bois Blanc Banded - 239 rim and decorated body sherds representing at least 25 vessels. Characterized by rims thickened by a strip of beading. * Bois Blanc Castellated Corded - 58 sherds representing a minimum of 5 vessels. Characterized by castellated, unthickened rims; little rim outflare or eversion; cord and cord wrapped object decoration with punctates. = Juntunen Ware = 1,031 rim and decorated body sherds were recovered, representing at least 309 vessels. This pottery is characterized by round bodied vessels without pronounced shoulders; less decoration with cords and cord-wrapped objects; collared and everted rims; punctate and drag-and-jab decoration. Similar to pottery found in Southwest Ontario including early Ontario Iroquois. Three types of Juntunen Ware are defined: * Juntunen Linear Punctate - 96 sherds representing at least 6 vessels. Characterized by smoothed-over cordmarked surface with bands of linear punctations on the collar. * Juntunen Collared - 35 sherds representing at least 22 vessels. Characterized by a coarser paste and larger temper particles; smooth surface lacking any cord-wrapped stick treatment; and decorated rims. * Juntunen Drag-and-jab - 893 sherds representing at least 281 vessels. Characterized by cord-wrapped paddle surface finish decorated in a variety of motifs, including drag-and-jab; rims collared and castellated. = Blackduck Ware = 154 rim sherds representing at least 45 vessels of Blackduck Ware was also present at the site. Blackduck was a Late Woodland culture encompassing a vast territory in Canada and the extreme north of the United States, centered on the north shore of Lake Superior. Blackduck has been dated from about 900 A.D. to early Historic period (c. 1600s A.D.). The Blackduck pottery is characterized by rounded vessels with recurved rims; cordmarked surfaces decorated by cord-wrapped stick or by punctates. It appears at Juntunen in Occupation A in the Mackinac Phase and may extend into the Bois Blanc Phase but was probably no longer being made during the Juntunen Phase. Earlier researchers have developed typologies for Blackduck, but the researchers at Juntunen recognized 2 types defined from the Juntunen assemblage: * Blackduck Banded - 46 rim sherds representing at least 20 vessels. Characterized by horizontal bands of cord-wrapped stick impressions associated with punctuate decoration. * Blackduck Punctate - 98 rim sherds representing at least 25 vessels. Like Blackduck Banded except decorations are limited to punctates. = Point Sauble Collared = Point Sauble Collared is a pottery type associated with the Late Woodland Effigy Mound culture of eastern Wisconsin. 40 sherds representing at least 15 vessels were recovered at Juntunen, mostly associated with the Bois Blanc Phase. Similar pottery has been reported from Aztalan, a Middle Mississippian site in southern Wisconsin. This pottery is characterized by cordmarked surfaces and cord-wrapped stick decoration on the rim and neck. Rims are braced and the 2 of the Juntunen specimens have angular orifices like those reported at Aztalan. = Ramey Incised = 11 sherds representing a single vessel were present at Juntunen. Ramey Incised is a Middle Mississippian pottery type first identified at the Cahokia Old Village site in southern Illinois. It has also been recovered at Carcajou Point in Wisconsin, but its presence at Juntunen marks the northernmost occurrence of any Middle Mississippian pottery type. Tempering is shell-tempered mixed with grit and decoration is a distinctive pattern of curvilinear designs. The vessel shape is thought to be a bowl with sharply defined shoulder. It was recovered in intermediate strata between the Bois Blanc and Juntunen Phases. = Oneota Ware = Oneota is an Upper Mississippian ware from Wisconsin and surrounding states. It is generally a shell-tempered ware but the specimens from Juntunen were almost all grit- tempered. 212 rim and body sherds representing at least 35 vessels were grit- tempered, while only 6 sherds representing 1 vessel were shell-tempered. The Juntunen specimens were characterized by flared rims, smooth surfaces, and scalloped, crimped or finger-pinched lips. One sherd was finger-trailed but otherwise all sherds were undecorated. No handles were observed. The Oneota at Juntunen is similar to the Oneota component at the Mero site in Wisconsin.  Significance  The Juntunen Site provides a detailed record of Late Woodland cultural development from approximately 800 A.D. through the 1400s A.D. Because of its centralized location relative to the Great Lakes, and the importance of water travel in Prehistoric times, it shows influences from all directions. The Mackinac and Bois Blanc Phases tend to show affinities with Wisconsin cultures, while the Juntunen Phase tends to show influence from Ontario and the Iroquois Tradition, the Blackduck pottery shows influence from the north and the Middle Mississippian pottery shows influence from the south. Juntunen is also the northernmost site from which maize has been recovered. Juntunen also shows signs of what would later become cultural practices of early Historic tribes. It is suggested that the ossuary burials were a tradition that later grew into the elaborate ceremonies such as the Huron Feast of the Dead, after European contact and the fur trade had transformed Native American cultures in the region. The “medicine kit” recovered from one of the burials, and the bald eagle burial, anticipates the practices of religious groups in early Historic tribes, such as the Midewiwin Society of the Algonkian tribe, or the False Face Society of the Iroquois. The practice of removing a plaque of the cranium of some burials, provides evidence of a Prehistoric religious practice that had apparently disappeared by Historic times. The researchers determined the seasonality of the site to be May through October, based on analysis of the species of animal bone and plant remains present. This would coincide with the spawning season of the sturgeon (late spring to early summer) and the whitefish (in the fall). These are the two major categories of animal bone collected at the site. The copper industry at Juntunen is also unique in the Late Woodland period. The last time copper had such a prominent role in artifact manufacture was in the Archaic Old Copper Culture (c. 3000 B.C.-1000 B.C.)

The Belgian Contingent was badly under strength at the time of the battle (comprising only 560 men instead of the more usual 900) since the battle occurred in the middle of a troop rotation in which many soldiers who had been in Korea since February 1951 (including a Luxembourg detachment, which formed part of A Company) had returned home in September 1951 – and reinforcements had not arrived. 10–11 October: Chinese artillery attack Almost immediately from their arrival at Haktang-ni, Belgian forces came under fire from artillery fire from PVA 76mm guns and mortar fire. One Belgian soldier was killed, several were wounded. In the evening of 10 October, the first PVA patrols attacked the positions of B Company. Recognising the importance of holding the position, the US 3rd Infantry Division commander Major General Robert H. Soule visited the positions at Haktang-ni by helicopter. As evening fell on the night of 11 October, the Belgians again came under fire – this time from PVA 60mm mortars from neighbouring Hill 317. 12 October 1951: Start of the battle In the early morning of 12 October 1951 several small-scale PVA assaults were repelled. First, at 03:45 a PVA patrol, supported by machine gun fire, attacked the Heavy Weapons Company. It was eventually driven back by US artillery fire from 105mm and 155mm artillery. One Belgian soldier was killed during this assault with six soldiers wounded of whom two were Korean soldiers attached to the Belgian Battalion. Later that day, from 08:00 to 15:00, patrols from B Company, climbed nearby Palli-Bong Hill (Hill 488) which was being used as an observation post by PVA forces. A second patrol from the Reconnaissance Platoon reached nearby Hill 317 found a PVA ammunition dump, which they destroyed, and then returned to Haktang-ni. During the day, numerous squads of 5–10 PVA soldiers had infiltrated behind the Belgian lines. The thick fog that had covered the battlefield during the day dispersed at 23:30 at the same moment as the main PVA assault began on the Heavy Weapons Company. Morning of 13 October 1951: Main PVA assault Operations Commando and Polecharge. The main PVA attack on the Heavy Weapons Company began at 23:30 on 12 October. The PVA troops were advancing on the front line of the Reconnaissance Platoon in perfect silence, moving through the barbed wire, when they can under fire from machine guns and flamethrowers. At the same time, B Company and the Heavy Weapons Company came under attack. PVA troops even took the position used by the HQ of the battalion. At 02:00, renewed PVA assaults began on the Heavy Weapons Company. However, by 04:00, the main attacks had been repulsed and all positions re-occupied. At daybreak, Hill 317 was re-occupied by Belgian troops, and a reconnaissance patrol from C Company came under machine gun and mortar fire from Palli-Bong hill. During the night, the bodies of many wounded and dead PVA soldiers were recovered by their comrades. Indeed, only 4 wounded PVA soldiers remained on the battlefield at daybreak. They were taken prisoner by the Belgians. Aftermath On orders from General Soule, the Belgians withdrew from positions back to the UN lines, taking up positions on Hill 362. Withdrawing from Haktang-ni, the Belgians watched a heavy artillery barrage falling on their vacated positions. The Belgian Battalion was awarded the citation of \\"HAKTANG-NI\\" on the flag of the unit which now held by the 3rd Parachute Battalion of the Belgian Army.Belgians Can Do Too!

The group's activity spanned from 1919 until its final collective exhibition in 1925. During its heyday, the group consisted of some of the most influential and prominent expressionist artists of their generations, including Will Heckrott, Lasar Segall, Otto Schubert and Constantin von Mitschke-Collande, as well as the architect Hugo Zehder and writers Walter Rheiner, Heinar Schilling, and Felix Stiemer. Much of what is considered by many art historians to be the true peak of German expressionist art occurred in the first decades of the twentieth century just prior to World War I. German expressionism of that period noted for its humourless and vicious criticism of the German government and upper classes, and was dominated by two major artistic groups known as Die Brücke (The Bridge), which was highly critical of Germany's increasingly imperialistic aggression and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), which focused much of its commentary on industrialization's impact on the natural world. But the European war brought about the collapse of European society and the major art groups were swiftly broken up and scattered by the onset of the first world war. Those artists who failed to flee Europe found themselves conscripted to the front lines and many important artist such as Franz Marc and August Macke were killed in the trenches. During the war, European art seemed to take an unofficial hiatus amongst the carnage and it was not until peace returned in 1918 that a second generation of young German expressionists, many having endured the war through their late teens to early twenties, congregated into a variety of artistic movements opposing the violence of war. In 1918, Conrad Felixmüller moved to Dresden, where he became the founder and chairman of the group. During his activities in Germany's progressive art and youth movements, Felixmüller worked for various newspapers including Die Sichel in Regensburg and Rote Erde in Hamburg). The Dresdner Sezessionists were heavily influenced by many of the other contemporary German art movements of their day. Many of the members kept a close eye on the flourishing avante-garde art movements such as the Dadaists. Artists like Dix adopted and appropriated many traits of dada such as the use of collage compositions into his own expressionistic style. Many founding members including Felixmüller, Dix and Schubert were active in a variety of other socially conscious, incendiary groups such the Novembergruppe. The works of this new generation of disillusioned artists placed a much greater emphasis on political and social reformation through pacifistic means. Rather than adopting the nihilistic social criticism and cynicism of their Die Brücke predecessors, these new expressionist would instead rally around optimistic and utopian beliefs that a happier world built on the ideal of peaceful coexistence could emerge from the ruins of 1918. This dream however would die with the advent of World War II and the rise of the Third Reich in the decades to come.  Later years under the Third Reich  Even though the group was officially dissolved in 1925 due to financial difficulties, the members would continue to have active and relatively successful political and artistic careers until the 1930s-40s when many were considered \\"Degenerates\\" by the newly formed Nazi Government and declared enemies of the state. Under antimodernist Alfred Rosenberg, many forms of modern art including Impressionism, Abstract, Cubism, Dada and Expressionism were declared illegal in the German state in preference for more realistic classical styles.http://science.jrank.org/pages/7688/Expressionism.html This legislation led to an aggressive and oppressive smear campaign in order to curb and stamp out modern art. Suddenly Felixmüller, Dix and the rest of the former secessionists found their studios being raided by the Gestapo and their paintings burned in the streets. Many artists considered lost their jobs at universities and museums and were forbidden from painting under threat of imprisonment. The few Jewish members, like the Brazilian-Lithuanian artist Segall, faced particularly harsh persecution and quickly emigrated from Germany; Segall himself moved to Brazil.

It is part of the Fine Chemical and Catalysts division of Johnson Matthey plc. Background=J.F. Macfarlan J.F. Macfarlan Ltd was founded in 1780 as an apothecary supplier. In 1815 John Fletcher Macfarlan, licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons, became the owner of the family business, and acquired an apothecary's shop in Edinburgh. He immediately began to manufacture laudanum, a medicine based on opium. In 1830 Macfarlan began a partnership with his former apprentice David Rennie Brown, and so incorporated the business as J.F. Macfarlan and Co Ltd. In 1832 the company began manufacture of morphine acetate (the medicinal version of heroin) and hydrochloride, which led to the development and manufacture of the anaesthetics ether and chloroform. This allowed the company to develop sterile dressings for Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister under contract. After acquiring the Abbeyhill chemical works in 1840 for the production of alkaloids, from 1870 the production of codeine began in 1886. The company then acquired another site in Northfield, Edinburgh, in 1900 for the production of strychnine. Duncan Flockhart John Duncan was born in Kinross in 1780. After serving a five-year apprenticeship in Edinburgh, he moved directly to London, before returning to Perth in 1806 to establish a chemists shop. After expanding to Edinburgh in 1820, Duncan dissolved the partnership with the Perth shop and started a new partnership in Edinburgh with William Flockhart (also from Kinross), which in 1833 was called Duncan & Flockhart, incorporated three years later. Following the death of John Duncan (c. 1839) the firm was taken over by his son Dr James Duncan. In the same year the firm began to manufacture lactucarium, and from 1847 supplied Chloroform to Sir James Simpson. The firm expanded, and supplied chloroform to both the British Army, Royal Navy and British Red Cross during both world wars. After the start of World War I, the company established a drug growing farm at Warriston, to assure supply. T&H; Smith T&H; Smith was established as a chemists at 21-23 Duke Street, Edinburgh in 1827, by Thomas Smith and his brother Henry. On 13 April 1839, just three months after Henry Fox Talbot had announced his photogenic drawing process, T&H; Smith placed an advert in The Scotsman offering photographic paper and chemicals. In 1840, having bought Blandfields Chemicals in Canongate and moved into their premises, the company developed the first liquid essence of coffee, later supplemented by creating various carbonated beverage flavours. Having opened a London branch in 1848, in 1851 the company discovered Aloin. But the company fortunes were made from 1855, when the first Morphine injection was developed. T&H; Smith was the first company to produce commercial quantities of Apomorphine, and then Diamorphine in 1887. In 1906 the company moved from Canongate to the suburban outskirts of Edinburgh at Gorgie. During World War I, the company supplied Morphine and over of Lint-based medical dressings to the British Army. In 1919, T&H; Smith bought Glasgow Apothecaries. In 1926, the company acquired John Mackay Chemicals, subsequently incorporating its associated subsidiaries in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Foundation In 1962, T&H; Smith bought Duncan Flockhart, and then merged with along J.F Macfarlan to form Edinburgh Pharmaceuticals. In 1965 the Glaxo Group bought Edinburgh Pharmaceuticals, rebranding it Macfarlan Smith Ltd. In 1958, while trying to develop dental anesthetic Lignocaine, the company had discovered the bitterest known substance, Denatonium. Developed as a denaturant for industrial alcohol, in the 1970s it was commercial marketed as Bitrex, a safety additive for household products such as liquid detergents. Tesco was the first supermarket to display the Bitrex brand on their products. In 1963 the company reproduced Etorphine, in a research group led by Professor Kenneth Bentley.Bentley KW, Hardy DG. \\"New potent analgesics in the morphine series.\\" Proceedings of the Chemical Society. 1963;220. Bought through a management buy out in 1990, Macfarlan Smith was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1993 under the holding company Meconic, the Greek language word for Poppy. Present In 2001, Johnson Matthey plc bought Meconic, and merged it into its Fine Chemical and Catalysts division. In late 2006, the British government permitted MacFarlan Smith to cultivate opium poppies in the United Kingdom for medicinal reasons, in response to increasing global prices for concentrate of poppy straw, the company's main raw material. A major opium poppy field is based in Didcot, England. As of 2012 they were growing in Dorset, Hampshire, Oxfordshire & Lincolnshire as a spring sown breakcrop recognised under the single payment scheme farm subsidy. The Office of Fair Trading has alerted the government to their monopoly position on growing in the UK and worldwide production of diamorphine and recommended consideration. The government's response advocated the status quo, being concerned interference might cause the company to stop production. The British government has since contradicted the Home Office's suggestion that opium cultivation can be legalized in Afghanistan for exports to the United Kingdom, helping lower poverty and internal fighting whilst helping the National Health Service to meet the high demand for morphine and heroin. Opium poppy cultivation in the United Kingdom does not need a licence, but a licence is required for those wishing to extract opium for medicinal products.The painkilling fields: England's opium poppies that tackle the NHS morphine crisis, Press release , 15 September 2007.

Ethylene and gas/chemical carriersEthylene and gas/chemical carriers http://www.liquefiedgascarrier.com/ethylene-carriers.html Ethylene carriers are the most sophisticated of the gas tankers and have the ability to carry not only most other liquefied gas cargoes but also ethylene at its atmospheric boiling point of . These ships feature cylindrical, insulated, stainless steel cargo tanks able to accommodate cargoes up to a maximum specific gravity of 1.8 at temperatures ranging from a minimum of −104 °C to a maximum of and at a maximum tank pressure of 4 bar. Fully refrigerated shipsFully refrigerated ships http://www.liquefiedgascarrier.com/Fully-Refrigerated-Ships.html Fully refrigerated ship LPG/C Maersk Houston They are built to carry liquefied gases at low temperature and atmospheric pressure between terminals equipped with fully refrigerated storage tanks. However, discharge through a booster pump and cargo heater makes it possible to discharge to pressurized tanks too. The first purpose-built, lpg tanker was the m/t Rasmus Tholstrup from a Swedish shipyard to a Danish design. Prismatic tanks enabled the ship's cargo carrying capacity to be maximised, thus making fully refrigerated ships highly suitable for carrying large volumes of cargo such as LPG, ammonia and vinyl chloride over long distances. Today, fully refrigerated ships range in capacity from . LPG carriers in the size range are often referred to as VLGCs (Very Large Gas Carriers). Although LNG carriers are often larger in terms of cubic capacity, this term is normally only applied to fully refrigerated LPG carriers. The main type of cargo containment system utilised on board modern fully refrigerated ships are independent tanks with rigid foam insulation. The insulation used is quite commonly polyurethane foam. Older ships can have independent tanks with loosely filled perlite insulation. In the past, there have been a few fully refrigerated ships built with semi-membrane or integral tanks and internal insulation tanks, but these systems have only maintained minimal interest. The large majority of such ships currently in service have been constructed by shipbuilders in Japan and Korea. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG carrier) LNG-carrier Galea The majority of LNG carriers are between in capacity. In the modern fleet of LNG carriers, there is an interesting exception concerning ship size. This is the introduction of several smaller ships of between having been built in 1994 and later to service the needs of importers of smaller volumes. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG carrier) Jayanti Baruna - CNG Cargo Carrier Compressed Natural Gas carrier ships CNG carrier are designed for transportation of natural gas under high pressure. CNG carrier technology relies on high pressure, typically over 250 bar (2900 psi), to increase the density of the gas and maximize the possible commercial payload. CNG carriers are economical for medium distance marine transport and rely on the adoption of suitable pressure vessels to store CNG during transport and on the use of suitable loading and unloading compressors to receive the CNG at the loading terminal and to deliver the CNG at the unloading terminal. Builders These vessels are designed to transport liquefied gas. Builders of Liquefied Gas Carriers are: * Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine * Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries * Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation * Damen Shipyards Group (http://products.damen.com/en/ranges/liquefied-gas- carrier) Cargoes carried on gas carriers *Butadiene *Ethylene *LPG *LNG *CNG *Propylene *Chemical gases such as ammonia, vinyl chloride, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and chlorine. Gas carrier codes The Gas Codes, developed by International Maritime Organization apply to all gas carriers regardless of size. There are three Gas Codes and these are described below. Gas carriers built after June 1986 (the IGC Code)IGC Code http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Environment/PollutionPrevention/ChemicalPollution/Pages/IGCCode.aspx The Code which applies to new gas carriers (built after 30 June 1986) is the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk. In brief, this Code is known as the IGC Code. The IGC Code, under amendments to International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), is mandatory for all new ships. As proof that a ship complies with the Code, an International Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Liquefied Gases in Bulk should be on board. In 1993, the IGC Code was amended and the new rules came into effect on 1 July 1994. Ships on which construction started on or after 1 October 1994 should apply the amended version of the Code but ships built earlier may comply with previous editions of the IGC Code. Gas carriers built between 1976 and 1986 (the GC Code) The regulations covering gas carriers built after 1976 but before July 1986 are included in the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk. It is known as the Gas Carrier Code or GC Code in short. Since 1975, International Maritime Organization (IMO) has approved four sets of amendments to the GC Code. The latest was adopted in June 1993. All amendments are not necessarily agreed by every government. Although this Code is not mandatory, many countries have implemented it into national law. Accordingly, most charterers will expect such ships to meet with Code standards and, as proof of this, to have on board a Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Liquefied Gases in Bulk. Gas carriers built before 1977 (the Existing Ship Code)Code for Existing Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk https://books.google.com/books/about/Code_for_Existing_Ships_Carrying_Liquefi.html?id=V5YniR_ssTAC&redir;_esc=y The regulations covering gas carriers built before 1977 are contained in the Code for Existing Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk. Its content is similar to the GC Code, though less extensive. The Existing Ship Code was completed in 1976 after the GC Code had been written. It therefore summarises current shipbuilding practice at that time. It remains as an IMO recommendation for all gas carriers in this older fleet of ships. The Code is not mandatory but is applied by some countries for ship registration and in other countries as a necessary fulfilment prior to port entry. Accordingly, many ships of this age are required by charterers to meet with Code standards and to have on board a Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Liquefied Gases in Bulk. Cargo containment systems A cargo containment system is the total arrangement for containing cargo including, where fitted: *A primary barrier (the cargo tank), *Secondary barrier (if fitted), *Associated thermal insulation, *Any intervening spaces, and *Adjacent structure, if necessary, for the support of these elements. For cargoes carried at temperatures between the ship's hull may act as the secondary barrier and in such cases it may be a boundary of the hold space. The basic cargo tank types utilised on board gas carriers are in accordance with the list below:— Independent TypeLiquefied Gas Carrier with Independent Tanks http://www.eagle.org/eagleExternalPortalWEB/ShowProperty/BEA%20Repository/Rules&Guides;/Current/144_LGCarrierswithIndependentTanks/Pub144_LGC_Guide * Independent Type 'A' Type A Independent Tanks are prismatic and supported on insulation-bearing blocks typically consisting of wooden chocks and located by anti-roll chocks located at the top of the tank inside the void space and anti-flotation chocks located inside the void space usually just above the double bottom tanks. The tanks are normally divided by a centreline liquid- tight bulkhead; by this feature, together with the chamfered upper part of the tank, the free liquid surface effect is reduced and thus the virtual rise of the Centre of gravity and the stability is increased. When these cargo tanks are designed to carry LPG (at −50 °C), the tank is constructed of fine-grained low-carbon manganese steel or even stainless steel as seen in the Maersk J class Ships. The hold space (void space) in this design is normally filled with dry inert gas or Nitrogen but may be ventilated with air during a ballast or gas free passage. The Conch design has been developed for carriage of LNG (at-163oC). The material for these cargo tanks has to be either 9% nickel steel or aluminium. The maximum allowable relief vapour setting (MARVS) is < 0\\\\. 7 bar. * Independent Type 'B' Type B Independent Tanks are generally spherical and welded to a vertical cylindrical skirt, which is the lone connection to the ship's main hull. The hold space (void space) in this design is normally filled with dry inert gas or Nitrogen but may be ventilated with air during a ballast or gas free passage. A protective steel dome covers the primary barrier above deck level, and insulation encloses the outside of the primary barrier surface. This containment system has been used for carriage of LNG. The material of construction is either 9% nickel steel or aluminium.Aluminium Cargo Tank Independent Type B, DSME Gas Tank Technology Approved By Lloyd’s Register http://marineinsight.com/news/new-dsme-gas-tank- technology-approved-by-lloyds-register/ The maximum Allowable relief vapour setting (MARVS) is < 0\\\\. 7 bar. * Independent Type 'C' Type C Independent Tanks are deck pressure vessels or cylindrical pressure tanks mounted horizontally on two or more cradle-shaped foundations. The tanks may be fitted on, below or partly below deck and be both longitudinally and transversely located. Lobe-type tanks are commonly used at the forward end of the ship, to improve the poor utilization of the hull volume. This containment system is used for LPG, Ethylene and small scale LNG carriers. The material, if used for the construction of tanks designed to carry ethylene, is 5% nickel steel. The maximum Allowable relief vapour setting (MARVS) is > 0. 7 bar. and *MembraneGaztransport and Technigaz Cargo Containment Systems Some other types such as: * Internal insulation Type '1' * Internal insulation Type '2' * Integral have been fully designed and approved but have not been commercially used yet. Hazards on gas carriers * Toxicity Vinyl chloride commonly carried on gas carriers is a known as a human carcinogen, particularly liver cancer.VCM and health effects http://www.pvc.org/en/p/vinyl-chloride-monomer It is not only dangerous when inhaled but can also be absorbed by the skin. Skin irritation and watering of the eyes indicate dangerous levels of VCM may be present in the atmosphere. Caution must be exerted while dealing with such cargoes, precautions such as use of Chemical suits Self-contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA's) and gas tight goggles must be worn at all times to prevent exposure. Chlorine and ammonia are other toxic cargoes carried.Health Effects of Ammonia http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/chem_profiles/ammonia/health_ammonia.html * Flammability Almost all cargo vapours are flammable. When ignition occurs, it is not the liquid which burns but the evolved vapour that burns. Flameless explosions which result out of cold cargo liquid coming into sudden contact with water do not release much energy. Pool fires which are the result of a leaked pool of cargo liquid catching fire and jet fires which are the result of the leak catching fire are grave hazards. Flash fires occur when there is a leak and does not ignite immediately but after the vapours travel some distance downwind and getting ignited and are extremely dangerous. Vapour cloud explosions and boiling liquid expanding vapor explosions are the most grave flammability hazards on gas carriers. * Frostbite The cargoes are carried at extremely low temperatures, from , and hence frostbite due to exposure of skin to the cold vapours or liquid is a very real hazard. * Asphyxia Asphyxia occurs when the blood cannot take a sufficient supply of oxygen to the brain. A person affected may experience headache, dizziness and inability to concentrate, followed by loss of consciousness. In sufficient concentrations any vapour may cause asphyxiation, whether toxic or not. Health effects of specific cargoes carried on gas carriers * Hazards of ammoniahttp://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/chem_profiles/ammonia/health_ammonia.html Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, Health Effects of Ammonia Gas 1\\\\. Exposure to more than 2,000 ppm – fatal in 30 minutes, 6,000 ppm – fatal in minutes, 10,000 ppm – fatal and intolerable to unprotected skin. 2\\\\. Anhydrous ammonia is not dangerous when handled properly, but if not handled carefully it can be extremely dangerous. It is not as combustible as many other products that we use and handle every day. However, concentrations of gas burn and require precautions to avoid fires. 3\\\\. Mild exposure can cause irritation to eye, nose and lung tissues. Prolonged breathing can cause suffocation. When large amounts are inhaled, the throat swells shut and victims suffocate. Exposure to vapours or liquid also can cause blindness 4\\\\. The water-absorbing nature of anhydrous ammonia that causes the greatest injury (especially to the eyes, nose, throat or lungs), and which can cause permanent damage. It is a colourless gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperature, but under pressure readily changes into a liquid. Anhydrous ammonia has a high affinity for water. Anhydrous ammonia is a hygroscopic compound, this means it will seek moisture source that may be the body of the operator, which is composed of 90 percent water. When a human body is exposed to anhydrous ammonia the chemical freeze burns its way into the skin, eyes or lungs. This attraction places the eyes, lungs, and skin at greatest risk because of their high moisture content. Caustic burns result when the anhydrous ammonia dissolves into body tissue. Most deaths from anhydrous ammonia are caused by severe damage to the throat and lungs from a direct blast to the face. An additional concern is the low boiling point of anhydrous ammonia. The chemical freezes on contact at room temperature. It will cause burns similar to, but more severe than, those caused by dry ice. If exposed to severe cold flesh will become frozen. At first, the skin will become red (but turn subsequently white); the affected area is painless, but hard to touch, if left untreated the flesh will die and may become gangrenous. 5\\\\. The human eye is a complex organ made up of about 80 percent water. Ammonia under pressure can cause extensive, almost immediate damage to the eye. The ammonia extracts the fluid and destroys eye cells and tissue in minutes. 6\\\\. Draining of ammonia into sea while pre-cooling of the hard-arm or during disconnection operations is not an eco-friendly operation. As a small quantity of ammonia as low as (LC50) is hazardous to Salmon as per ICSC, USA. Consumption of such fish could be dangerous to humans.

History The first half- acre of land was donated in 1687 by Valentine Hollingsworth, one of the area's settlers. Members of Hollingsworth's family hosted the Quaker Meeting in their home adjacent to the burial ground until the death of Valentine's daughter Catherine and her husband George Robinson. When the Newark Meeting closed in 1754, the cemetery took the name \\"Newark Free Burial Ground\\", and became the resting place for at least two soldiers from the American Revolutionary War. Part of the wall surrounding the cemetery dates to 1787, when Charles Robinson, Valentine's great-grandson, carved his initials into one of the stones. After the war, the property fell into neglect for more than half a century. In 1845, neighbors raised money to enlarge the cemetery by an acre and erect a non-denominational church, called Newark Union Church. In 1888, the church was adopted into the Methodist Episcopal Conference, and took the name Newark Union M. E. Church; the building was subsequently remodeled in 1906. Notable burials Of the nearly 950 graves, many headstones bear the names of some of the oldest families of the Brandywine Hundred.

It is located within the north-west corner of Tophill. The sculpture park has existed since 1983, while the site also become a nature reserve around 2004. To date, the quarry displays a collection of various carvings and works in Portland stone. Background Tout Quarry was worked commercially during the 18th and 19th-centuries. The quarry was last worked in 1982 for a boulder contract when 30,000 tons were excavated for sea defenses. Portland Sculpture & Quarry Trust began the sculpture park in 1983, saving the quarry from further mineral extraction with the creation of sculptures, and the park officially opened in that year. Many of the original site specific sculptures can still be discovered today, although some didn't last much longer than a year. In places around the quarry, there are numerous ravines leading to the cliff edge. Tramway lines once ran throughout the quarry, taking stone waste to the cliff edge to be tipped or taking block stone to Priory Corner where it was transported along the Merchant's Railway to Castletown, from where it as shipped across the world. The Grade II Listed Lano's Bridge was built in the mid-1800s to carry a high level tramway taking stone waste to the cliff edge. Portland Sculpture and Quarry Trust The Portland Sculpture and Quarry Trust was formed in 1983 when the quarry was turned into a park.http://learningstone.org/images/stories/Tout_3_word.doc The trust is dedicated to \\"preserving a knowledge and understanding of all aspects of stone and the landscape from which it comes\\". It operates within the quarry and at its headquarters at the nearby Drill Hall. An outdoor workshop is located within the quarry and is used to run courses from May to September each year. The yearly programme of stone carving and sculpture courses teaches skills in stone carving direct carving, lettercutting, relief carving and architectural detail. The indoor workspace at the Drill Hall is also used for this purpose. In 2008, the Trust was the runner-up in the British Urban Regeneration Association's awards for community-inspired regeneration.

The target was the Civil Guard barracks in the town. However the bomb initially failed to explode near its target. The police treated the car as an abandoned vehicle, not realising that it contained a bomb and while being towed away, the car bomb exploded, killing two police officers and the civilian towing the car away. The bombing was the deadliest of the 40 attacks which ETA carried out in the Province of Alicante between 1979 and 2004.ETA ha atentado en 40 ocasiones en Alicante, El Pais, 7 December 2004 The attack ETA had carried out similar attacks against Civil Guard barracks in Zaragoza in 1987, killing 12 people, and in Vic three and a half months before the Mutxamel attack, killing ten people. The Mutxamel barracks was home to six Civil Guards, three of them married and living there with their families.Un coche bomba de ETA mata a dos policías locales y a un vecino de un pueblo de Alicante, El Pais, 17 September 1991 To commit the attack, ETA used a Ford Fiesta, bearing false number plates, which had been stolen months earlier in the Basque country, loading it with 50 kilos of explosives. They used an anti- theft bar, attached to the steering wheel, to guide the direction, ignition and gears and pushed the driverless car towards the barracks. However it missed its target, crashing instead into the wall of a nearby bank. Having failed to detonate the bomb, they abandoned the vehicle. An hour later, employees of the bank began arriving for work and notified the police of the vehicle. Believing that they were dealing with a simple traffic accident, potentially caused by a drunk driver who had panicked and abandoned his vehicle, the police ordered the vehicle to be towed away.La Vanguardia, p18, 17 September 1991 Inside the car pound, the bomb exploded, with the tow truck driver and the two police accompanying him killed instantly. A further 30 people were injured. Convictions In 1995, Gonzalo Rodriguez Cordero and Jose Gabriel Zabala Erasun were each sentenced to 136 years in prison for unlawful use of motor vehicles, unlawfully replacing license plates, possession of explosives and as participants in a crime of assault, three of murder, four of causing injuries and one of terrorism. In January 2007, three streets in the town were renamed in memory of the victims.La familia del asesinado en Mutxamel «no se fía», Las Provincias, 21 October 2011 References ETA (separatist group) actions 1991 crimes in Spain Terrorist incidents in Spain Car and truck bombings in Spain 1990s murders in Spain 1991 murders in Europe Terrorist incidents in Spain in the 1990s Terrorist incidents in Europe in 1991 History of the province of Alicante Building bombings in Spain ","title":"Mutxamel bombing"},{"id":"36083286","text":"Ryan Wallace may refer to: * Ryan Wallace (artist) (born 1977), multi-media artist * Ryan Wallace (footballer) (born 1990), Scottish footballer ","title":"Ryan Wallace"},{"id":"36083303","text":"Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) is the proactive, methodical management of a contract from initiation through award, compliance and renewal. Implementing CLM can lead to significant improvements in cost savings and efficiency. Understanding and automating CLM can also limit organizational liability and increase compliance with legal requirements. Process The key steps in a Contract Lifecycle Management process are: #Capture: Step #1 for most people is to get all of their existing paper contracts in a central visible place. If you have no clear idea what contracts you have, then you have no idea what your potential risk exposure is. #The next step is to capture the data from the contracts. #Track: Once you know where all your contracts are, the next step is to track any important data so you don't miss any milestone. This affects both old contracts and newly signed contracts. #Author: With tracking in place, the focus can shift to accelerating the new contract creation process. The \\"authoring\\" process is about setting up contract templates and clause libraries to empower business users and legal users, respectively, to create new contracts in a fast but controlled fashion. #Create: Contract creation has two tracks. First, empowering business users with self-service, wizard-based creation using intelligent templates pre-approved by legal. Second, making life easier for legal when drafting complex deals on your own paper, or reviewing and “patching” contracts negotiated on other people's paper. #Approve: Companies need an approval workflow process to ensure that risky contracts are reviewed and approved by the right person. Some risks need to be approved by legal, some by management, some by special departments like credit, etc. Ideally, safe deals are pre-approved. #Negotiate: The needs of the typical negotiator include: a checklist of issues for each type of deal, a way of marking up the paper to highlight how it is different from the original or the last draft, and a way of capturing and flagging those differences (if possible). #Sign: When the contract is final and agreed it needs to be signed by all relevant people, and the signed copies need to be stored. Someone also needs to validate that the final signed version was not modified in any way after execution copies were sent out. #Analyze: Enterprises with 100+ contracts need to analyze those contracts for potential risks, rights and obligations. Executives and legal and risk management professionals need reports to manage common risks, and ad hoc reports for unexpected scenarios. \\"Fingertip access\\" to contract terms and data allows people to react quickly to new scenarios and deal with time-sensitive risks.

In Denmark the type of mound is used to distinguish dolmens in the nomenclature (Runddysse and Langdysse) It is encountered especially frequently in the north of the Danish island of Zealand, in the Swedish province of Bohuslän and on the Cimbrian Peninsula, for example, at Troldkirken in Jutland.

An externally built entrance passage, whilst obligatory, has often not survived. In Dithmarschen the rectangular and polygonal dolmens of Albersdorf are particularly important. The Brutkamp is one of the most impressive examples of this type. Typologically viewed, the chamber of Hemmelmark, Rendsburg-Eckernförde, stands out, with its unusual dimensions of 2.8 × 2.25 metres and the division of sub-chambers by vertical slabs. Polygonal dolmen occur more rarely within stone enclosures (Schülldorf) and more frequently in round barrows (e.g. Dannewerk, Eckernförde, Haßmoor and Süderende). Originally it was thought (e.g. by Ekkehard Aner, Johannes Brondstedt) that this type of dolmen originated in the west, due to its approximately circular construction. These views were refuted by comprehensive research by Ewald Schuldt in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, which emphasized the autochthonous origin of different types.

It specializes in commercial and institutional construction. In 2010, DiversityBusiness.com listed Flintco as the top Native American-owned company. Prior to 2013, Flintco was owned by a Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma family. In January 2013, Flintco was acquired by Alberici Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri, which said that Flintco would continue to operate on an independent basis.\\"St. Louis firm acquires Tulsa-based Flintco\\", Tulsa World, January 8, 2012 (pay site).Greta Weiderman, \\"Alberici closes on acquisition of Flintco\\", St. Louis Business Journal, January 8, 2013. History Flintco was founded in 1908 as Tulsa Rig, Reel, and Manufacturing Company (TRR). It served as a supplier of drilling and pumping equipment for the burgeoning oil industry. C.W. Flint became co-owner of TRR in 1919 and sole owner in 1935, expanding operations to include oil field lumber yards and the building of derricks. TRR diversified into building construction, working for the U.S. government building Army bases and air fields. It was between 1949 through 1958 that Flintco undertook its first remodel construction project on the Hillcrest Medical Center campus in Tulsa. From 1959 to 1998, the company slowly started to expand, providing construction services outside of Oklahoma, into Kansas and Arkansas, eventually establishing offices in Oklahoma City, Memphis, Tenn., Springdale, Ark., Albuquerque, N.M., Austin, Texas and Sacramento, Calif. During this time, Flintco established a separate division, Oakridge Builders, that focuses on general construction in the Oklahoma and Arkansas area. In 1994, Flintco was sued by a sub-contractor alleging that Flintco interfered with the sub-contractor's job performance. The trial court found that although the contract lacked a damages for delays clause, Flintco's interference caused damage to the sub-contractor. The case was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which affirmed the award of damages. The case has subsequently been widely published in legal guides for construction companies. In 2011, Flintco, LLC was named as having the top building contractor safety program in the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) 236, 2 million-plus man-hour category at the Associated Builders & Contractors' (ABC) Excellence In Construction Awards. That same year, it also received the Associated General Contractors top award for its safety program. Notable projects Flintco has constructed the Oklahoma State Capitol, Memphis Traffic Control Tower, Institute of American Indian Arts, the Texas State Capitol, Oklahoma State University Boone Pickens Stadium, and the University of Oklahoma Gaylord Family Memorial Stadium.

The Medal followed the Golden Jubilee Medal, issued ten years previously, both in terms of design and award criteria, with those qualifying for both medals receiving a ribbon clasp in lieu of a second medal. Issue The medal was awarded to those involved in the official celebrations of Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, including members of the Royal Family, Royal Household and government officials, as well as Envoys, Foreign Ambassadors and Colonial Prime Ministers. Military recipients included selected officers, sailors and soldiers of the Royal Navy and Army, and the Indian and colonial contingents, that participated in jubilee activities, including the London procession in which the Queen took part. The medal was worn on the left breast with other coronation and jubilee medals. These were worn before campaign medals until November 1918, after which the order of wear was changed, with such commemorative medals now worn after campaign medals and before long service awards. Ladies could wear the medal near their left shoulder with the ribbon tied in the form of a bow. Different versions Three types of medal were awarded: * Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Medal.

The national park was established in 1978 to protect the landscapes of the Berchtesgaden Alps. Headquartered in the town of Berchtesgaden, the park was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1990. Location and geography The park is located in the mountainous area south of the town of Berchtesgaden. The eastern, southern, and western boundaries of the park coincide with the state border between Germany and Austria. The area of the park is economically undeveloped, and there are no settlements. In the center of the park is a large lake, the Königssee, which is elongated from the south to the west and is the source of the Königsseer Ache, a right tributary of the Salzach. A smaller lake, the Obersee, is located above the Königssee and drains into it. The whole area of the park belongs to the drainage basin of the Salzach, and, consequently, of the Danube. West of the lake is the massif of Watzmann (), and beyond that, separated by the Wimbachtal valley, the massif of Hochkalter (). The Watzmann is the third highest mountain massif in Germany. The Watzmann Glacier, located below the eastern face of the Watzmann, and the Blaueis, adjacent to the Hochkalter, are two of the five glaciers in Germany. History The first nature conservation area in the Berchtesgaden Alps was created in what is currently the southeastern part of the park in 1910. It had an area of and was organized according to the model of National Parks in the United States. In 1919, the mountain hotel of St. Bartolomew was built. In March 1921, the area was expanded to . At the time, it included both the Watzmann and the Hochkalter. During World War II, Hermann Göring, who, among other responsibilities, was the State Minister of Forestry and Hunting, declared the area around Obersee a particularly protected natural conservation area. In addition, six areas formally protecting the fauna were designated. In practice, they were used for hunting. The initiative to create a national park was first introduced in 1953. In the 1960s, a concurrent initiative to build an aerial lift to the summit of Watzmann was put forward. It clearly contradicted the plans for creation of a national park, and in the end it was abandoned in 1972 by the decision of the Free State of Bavaria, which also decided to create a national park. The park was opened on 1 August 1978, and had a total area of .Nationalparkplan, pp. 5–6 In 1990, the national park was recognized by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve. In 2010, the park was expanded. As of 2012, its area was . Tourism There are six information centers, located in Berchtesgaden, in Ramsau, and inside the park. The park maintains an extensive network of trails. One of the cultural attractions of the park is the pilgrimage Church of Saint Bartholomew, located on the Königssee.

Career and education  She attended what is now known as the Chautauqua Institution and continued to work there for ten years after graduating. Joseph Talbot founded a real estate brokerage but died of influenza just a few years later, in 1890. Rebecca, still unmarried, took over the business at a time when it was rare for a woman to be in business at all, let alone running a firm. Even while running the brokerage, she maintained an active involvement in charity and social activism. At various times, she led, among other organizations, the Alliance of Women's Clubs of Brooklyn, the People's Political League of Kings County, the Memorial Hospital for Women and Children, and the Welcome Home for Girls. In 1927, she founded (with the Alliance) The Rebecca Talbot Perkins Adoption Society, which later became Talbot Perkins Children's Services.

Located in Parnell, it replaced the earlier Old St Mary's. This wooden Gothic Revival church was designed by the prominent Christchurch architect Benjamin Mountfort and completed in 1897. The building served as the Cathedral Church and principal Anglican church of Auckland until 1973 when the Chancel of Holy Trinity Cathedral, for which the foundation stone was laid in 1957, came into use. In 1982, St Mary's Church was moved across Parnell Road to its present site beside the Cathedral. History tribune reminiscent of a Romanesque European cathedral St Mary's Church. Some of the Church's numerous gables, their Gothic lancet windows echoed in the design of the windows of the new cathedral immediately behind Elizabeth II at St Marys Cathedral, 25 December 1953 Old St Mary's, as it came to be known (built in 1860) was replaced by a large wooden church, for which the Foundation Stone was laid in 1886. At more than 50 metres long, it is the largest wooden Gothic church in the world. Its English born architect Benjamin Mountfort had become one of New Zealand's most eminent architects, responsible for many of the Gothic Revival buildings in Christchurch. St Mary's is generally regarded as the most impressive of his wooden church designs. The original intention had been to build the church in stone, but the plan had been rejected as too expensive. Mountfort seems to have ignored the perishable and limited qualities of wood, and built a vast church worthy of the finest stone. St Mary's covers an area of and has architectural features normally associated only with the great medieval cathedrals of Europe. Bishop William Cowie instigated the decision to make St Mary's the Cathedral Church during 1887, and the first part of the church, consisting of the Chancel and three bays of the Nave was consecrated and used from 1888. The church was completed to its present state by the addition of the four final bays and consecrated in 1898. It was Mountfort's final large scale work. Externally the most noticeable architectural features of the long rectangular building are the numerous gables of the mostly single story structure. The gables, often placed above lancet shaped windows, serve to accentuate the Gothic motifs. This is particularly evident on the exterior of the altar tribune where three tall narrow windows rise up into the gables themselves, the tribune itself is three sided, the wooden construction making the traditional Romanesque curve in stone impossible. The opposing end of the church containing the principal entrance, displays the full height of the building with one large gable, containing not only ground floor windows but two levels of clerestory windows above. The gable here slopes at two angles. The architect's reasoning for this was to increase the height of the gable at the façade's centre, rather than allow it to rise uniformly according to the width of the building. This central steeper roof pitch increased the ceiling height to the central aisle, as would be found over the central aisle of a true Gothic cathedral. However, the resultant effect has been to create a gable which to European eyes appears as though designed to bear the weight of heavy snow falls. In an area where snow does not occur this gives the façade, with its protruding decorated architrave above the first clerestory, an almost whimsical Swiss chalet atmosphere, which adds greatly to the building's individuality. Almost a hundred years later this feature was subtly suggested in the corresponding roof-line of the new Cathedral Nave. In 1982 St Mary's Church was moved into the precinct of the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, a major feat of engineering when the church was transported across the road and turned through 90° onto its present site.

Biography Richard Olivier de Longueil was born in Lisieux on December 18, 1406, the son of Guillaume III de Longueil, sieur of Eu, and his second wife, Catherine de Bourguenole.Biography from the Biographical Dictionary of the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church His family was an old noble family from Normandy. After receiving a licentiate in law, Longueil became a protonotary apostolic. He went on to become president of the Chambre des comptes and cantor of Lisieux Cathedral. He became a canon of Rouen Cathedral and Archdeacon of Eu. In 1452, the cathedral chapter of Rouen Cathedral wished to make him Archbishop of Rouen, but he declined. In 1453, he was elected Bishop of Countances. He was consecrated as a bishop on September 28, 1453. He was preconized as bishop by Pope Callixtus III on October 3, 1453, and took the oath of loyalty to Charles VII of France on May 12, 1454. He occupied the see of Coutances until his death. On June 11, 1455, Pope Callixtus III named Bishop Longueil, along with Guillaume d'Estouteville, Archbishop of Rouen and Guillaume Chartier, Bishop of Paris, to a papal commission charged with posthumously retrying Joan of Arc. Her rehabilitation was pronounced in the archiepiscopal palace of Rouen on July 7, 1456. Pleased with this outcome, Charles VII named Longueil to the Grand Conseil and later honored him with his trust by naming him as Charles' envoy on a mission to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. At the request of the King of France, Pope Callixtus III made Longueil a cardinal priest in the consistory of December 17, 1456. He did not participate in the papal conclave of 1458 and the red hat did not arrive in France until later in 1458. Shortly after, in the Estates General, he proposed revoking the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges (1438); for this action, he was praised by Pope Pius II and fined 10,000 livres by the Estates. On August 15, 1461, he attended the coronation of Louis XI of France and shortly thereafter resigned as president of the Chambres des comptes. Louis XI revoked the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges and Cardinal Longueil was part of a delegation (including Jean Jouffroy, Bishop of Arras) sent to inform the pope. They arrived in Rome on March 13, 1462; were received by the pope on March 14; and the ceremony recognizing the abrogation of the Pragmatic Sanction took place in a consistory held on March 16. In that same consistory, Longueil was given the titular church of Sant'Eusebio. Cardinal Longueil now fixed his residence in Rome and became a close adviser of the pope. As a result of his having left France, on May 24, 1463, the Conseil du Roi issued an order stopping all his benefices. He participated in the papal conclave of 1464 that elected Pope Paul II. The new pope named him archpriest of St Mark's Basilica, Venice. On October 1, 1464, the pope named him papal legate to Perugia. He returned to Rome on February 10, 1468. He died in Sutri on August 19, 1470. He was buried in St Mark's Basilica. His death was commemorated in Rouen Cathedral on August 19 until the time of the French Revolution.

Key: Einfassung = enclosure, Hügel = mound, Kulturschicht mit Pflugspuren = cultural layer with plough marks, Steinpackung = stone packing, Trennende Querreihe(n) = dividing row(s), Bestattungen = graves.  Unchambered long barrows of the Funnelbeaker culture  In the region occupied by the peoples of the Funnelbeaker culture (TBK), unchambered long barrows fall into the megalith category because, in many cases, their generally very low mounds, which are located mainly along the lower reaches of the rivers Elbe (Lower Elbe), Oder and Vistula, have an enclosure of megaliths, about one metre high. Due to their small dimensions they were not suitable for constructing chambers, which is why there are no chambers made of large stone blocks. The enclosures (see Nordic megalith architecture) are trapezoidal or rectangular. East of the River Oder they are often trapezoidal or triangular with rounded tips, (Mound 9 at Sarnowo, near Konin, Poland) mostly, however, without transverse walls (megalithic and non- megalithic) dividing them into separate chambers. The site of Kritzow (Ludwigslust-Parchim), has guardian stones higher than a man. Apart from the sites researched by Ewald Schuldt in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Gnewitz, Rothenmoor and Stralendorf there are a further 11 in the area and five more examples in the forest of Sachsenwald. One group of three grave sites was first discovered in 1969 in the Alt Plestliner Holz, Vorpommern-Greifswald. One of these enclosures is 80 metres long. Five unchambered barrows were investigated in the 19th century by J. Ritter in the county of Hagenow. All these sites are characterized by clearly defined mounds of stone (cobbles), which are covered beneath the mound with packed boulders. In the complex of Stralendorf (Ludwigslust-Parchim county) were six such mounds of cobbles, lying transversely and longitudinally, bounded by a 125-metre-long trapezoidal enclosure. Such mounds are sometimes found outside the enclosures or are found in or adjacent to barrows in which there are chambers, for example, in two of the four barrows of Grundoldendorf. The barrow of Alter Hau in the forest of Sachsenwald has a length of 154 metres and is one of the longest sites in Nordic megalith architecture. The Tinnum long barrow (Langbett von Tinnum) on the island of Sylt is a long barrow that has neither a chamber nor a megalithic enclosure, but is constructed of stones about the size of a football. It clearly represents a transitional type. If one considers sites without stone enclosures, whose mound had an enclosure of wooden posts in the past, of which there is now little trace, then the category of unchambered long barrows widens further, for example, to include the Tinnum long barrow, Barkjær (in Djursland) or Danica Nørremark (on Jutland). These so-called \\"Konens Høj type (Danish) or Niedźwiedź type graves (Polish) are especially common in the Funnelbeaker culture area east of the River Oder.  British Isles  The 200 or so British earthen long barrows were constructed with an enclosure of wooden posts. They are especially common in Wiltshire and Yorkshire. Three sites lie in Scotland and one on the Isle of Man. The barrows were formed over wooden chambers. In East Scotland there is another chamberless and non-megalithic variant: the \\"chamberless cairn\\", of which there are about 50 cairns without chambers. These only occur in England (12) in Cumbria and Northumberland.  France  The earth mounds or tumuli in Brittany are pre-megalithic, such as the tertres allongés in Landes and Morbihan. They are low, slab-enclosed mounds, 15 to 35 metres wide and 40 to 100 metres long. They are rectangular or oval and contain dry walled internal structures for cremation ashes and grave goods. In the early megalithic period oversized earth mounds emerged, like the tumulus of Carnac, that has ciste- like elements. A newly discovered barrow of this type lies in La Trinité-sur- Mer. Barrows with enclosures of wooden posts (without stone) are the Middle Neolithic enclosures of the Passy type, some of which are ascribed to the Cerny culture. This type of mound with wooden post or palisade enclosures are also found in the region of the early Funnelbeaker culture: the Konens Høj and Niedźwiedź type graves in Central Germany and Poland. British, French and Nordic sites have no cultural connexion with one another at all.

He is the current world record holder for the event, having scored 198 out of 200 at a World Cup event in Arizona during 2012. A member of the British team for the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was the youngest competitor in the men's double trap event, where he won the gold medal. Early life Born in Dorset on 15 September 1986, Wilson took up shooting at his father's suggestion after he suffered nerve damage to his shoulder in a snowboarding accident which left him unable to play squash and cricket. He was raised on his parents' farm. Education Wilson was educated at three independent schools: at the pre-prep St. Antony's Leweston Preparatory School in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset, the junior school Hazlegrove Preparatory School in the village of Sparkford, near the town of Yeovil in Somerset, followed by senior school at Millfield School in the town of Street, also in Somerset. He then went to Arts University Bournemouth (formerly Arts Institute at Bournemouth), in the large coastal town of Poole in Dorset, where he studied Graphic Design. Career Wilson tried his hand at both skeet and trap but was not enthusiastic enough to train religiously for them. However, after trying double trap he found a discipline that he is happy to train for every day. Wilson was encouraged by Ian Coley after meeting at the Bisley shooting ground. Soon after this he was training with shooters such as Richard Faulds and Stevan Walton. Within four months of trying shooting at the Bisley Ranges, Wilson became the 2006 European Junior Champion at the tournament in Slovenia. In 2008 he attended the 2008 Summer Olympics as part of Great Britain's Olympic Ambition Programme to expose possible future Olympians to the Olympic experience. He began being coached by Ahmad Mohammad Hasher Al Maktoum, who is a member of the ruling family of Dubai and the 2004 Summer Olympics gold medallist in the double trap. Following budget cuts by UK Sport following the lack of shooting medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Wilson's funding was removed completely and he was required to fund his shooting expenses which amount to nearly £10,000 a year. He tried to work in a pub as a barman, but found that the night shifts conflicted with his shooting practice. His parents instead funded him for a year while he tried to secure further funding. He has also raised funds, along with the rest of the British shooting team, by running fundraising events. Wilson finished in fourth place at the 2011 European Shooting Championships in Belgrade with a score of 191 in the final. However, the British team came second overall, earning Wilson a silver medal alongside Stevan Walton and Richard Faulds. At a World Cup event held in Tucson, Arizona in 2012, Wilson set a new world record for the double trap. He scored 198 out of a possible 200 in the final, beating the previous record of 196. By winning a silver at the World Cup event in Chile in March 2012, he gained another quota spot for the British team for the 2012 Summer Olympics. He is a member of the Southern Counties shooting club. Having warmed up at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich in April in the test event for the Olympic venue, on 28 May, Wilson was named part of the British team at the 2012 Summer Olympics. He won gold, scoring 188 out of a possible 200 hits on 2 August 2012. It was Britain's first Olympic shooting medal since teammate Richard Faulds won the event in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Wilson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to shooting. On 31 October 2014, at the age of 28, Wilson officially announced his retirement from competitive shooting to focus on personal life and coaching, ending abruptly his short, but remarkable career with an Olympic gold medal in men's double trap from London 2012, and three more from the 2013 ISSF World Cup series.

Among others, the regiment participated in the battle of Tienhaara. The regiment has been the subject of several books, as well as a feature film Framom främsta linjen. In 1980, Lieutenant general A. E. Martola opined: \\"Honestly, this regiment saved Finland during the midsummer weekend 1944, even if only temporarily.\\"Nykvist, Nils-Erik: Sextiettan Infanteriregemente 61 ()  Continuation War  The Continuation War (, , 25 June 1941 – 19 September 1944) was the second of two wars fought between Finland and the Soviet Union during World War II. Acts of war between the Soviet Union and Finland started on 22 June 1941, the day Germany launched its invasion of the Soviet Union. Open warfare started with a Soviet air offensive on 25 June. Subsequent Finnish operations undid its post-Winter War cessations on the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia, and captured East Karelia by September 1941. On the Karelian Isthmus, the Finns froze their offensive 30 km from Leningrad, where the pre-World War II border of the Soviet Union and Finland ran. Even though Hitler repeatedly asked the Finns to attack Leningrad the Finns did not attack the city, yet they passively participated in the siege by holding their pre-World War II land for two and a half years on the Karelian Isthmus.  Mobilization  A general mobilization was initiated on 17 June 1941 in anticipation of renewed hostilities, and each Military Province was charged with establishing an army division. In the Vaasa Military Province, the 19th Division was established with colonel Hannu Esa Hannuksela as commander. However, the Defense Corps of Ostrobothnia was not incorporated into the 19th division, but instead established its own regiment: the 61st Infantry Regiment. Jäger Movement Colonel Rafael Berg was appointed as commanding officer.  Combat history = The Battles of Säntämä  As part of the advance of the Finnish 17th Division, the 61st Infantry Regiment first advanced past the old border line in August 1941 and broke through enemy lines at the battle of Säntämä between 18 August 1941 and 7 September 1941. After this, the regiment continued its advance into Soviet territory, encountering only light defense by the Soviet forces.  The Battles of Svir and Jandeba  The regiment crossed the Svir River on 21 September 1941, where it overcame heavy resistance by Soviet forces. Subsequently, it advanced towards the Jandeba River, though under continued heavy fighting.  Shemenski and Podporoze  After crossing the Jandeba River, the 61st Regiment advanced towards the area of the village of Shemenski and city of Podporoze, where it entered into trench warfare and remained for a period of more than two years until May 1944. The city of Podporoze was occupied by the 61st Infantry Regiment from 12 December 1941 until 30 January 1942, when it was moved back to the Shemenski area to relieve the Finnish 34th Infantry Regiment.  The Russian Spring Offensive in 1942  At the beginning of 1942, the Soviet 7th Army was facing the Finnish 17th Division in the Svir area. The 61st Regiment was located at the east, opposite the Soviet 114th Infantry Division. Towards the end of March, the Soviet Army concentrated their forces, and launched its Spring Offensive at the start of April 1942. The objective was to force the retreat of the Finnish Army across the Svir River and capture a bridgehead for continued advance towards the old frontier. The gravity point of the attack was in an 18 kilometer wide arch headed by the Soviet 21st Division and the Soviet 69th Marine Infantry Brigade, and supported in the flank by the Soviet 114th Infantry Division. The main Soviet advance soon encountered fierce resistance, requiring the Soviet 114th Division to be thrown into the main line of attack, after which the Soviet forces managed to break through the Finnish lines between Shemenski and Pertjärvi. As preparation for a Finnish counterattack, a major Finnish combat unit was formed on 17 April, of which the 61st Infantry Regiment was a key component. The Finnish counterattack was launched on 19 April and by 22 April all the Soviet forces that had advanced through the Finnish lines between Shemenski and Pertjärvi had been annihilated. The Finnish Army suffered losses of 2,165 men, while the Soviet 7th Army suffered losses of just under 12,800 men.Raunio, Ari: De Militära Operationerna De Finska Krigen 1939 - 1945 ()  Trench Warfare 1942–1944  Despite labeled as a period of \\"trench warfare\\", a state of continuous active warfare signified this period. Constant patrols into enemy territory, artillery barrage and readiness to counterattack, characterized this phase of the war. Specialized patrol troops were formed, some of which achieved almost legendary fame within the regiment. An example was the patrol unit led by lieutenant Harry Järv, who made more than two hundred combat patrols into the no man's land between the opposing forces in 1942 and 1943, before being severely wounded and repatriated to the home front. Subsequent to the change of commander from lieutenant colonel Nils Roos to lieutenant colonel Alpo Marttinen, a fierce combat took place around the hills of Teeri-Kukkula, when Russian forces attacked the positions of IR61 between 8 November until 20 November 1942. At a critical moment on 10 November, when the Finnish line wavered, Marttinen personally took charge of a counterattack, halting any retreating soldiers, and with a drawn pistol commanding: We do not yield an inch! Attack! Officers first! Men, follow me!, successfully halting the advancing Russian troops. The commander of the 17th Division, Alonzo Sundman, moved several reserve units into battle positions, and a battle unit was formed under major general Ruben Lagus. Some terrain was lost at the conclusion of this Russian offensive, and this terrain could not have been retaken without significant air and tank support. The commander-in- chief, field marshal Mannerheim, therefore decided, on the advice of major general Lennart Oesch, to not attempt to recapture the lost terrain. As the first significant battle the appointment of Marttinen as commander of IR61, it also served to cement mutual respect and trust between the regiment and its new commander. A second main battle was fought around the hill of Teeri between 26 October and 28 October 1943. This battle became well known within the Finnish high command due to a daring counterattack executed by volunteers under the command of captain Renvall, rolling up the entrenched Russian forces on the Teeri hill and forcing them to blow up their own munition supplies.  Reserve Duties 22 May 1944 – 16 June 1944  After more than two years at the front, IR61 was relieved of duty on 22 May 1944 and placed in reserve, behind the line held by the 5th Division, in the area of Kinkijeva-Ontroila- Karelskaja. Lieutenant-Colonel Marttinen was on leave from his regiment between 1 June 1944 until 8 June 1944, and spent these days touring the Swedish speaking area of Ostrobothnia from where most of the soldiers of IR61 were drafted.  Tienhaara and the Soviet Offensive of 1944  The regiment was deployed for defense at Tienhaara, which was located along the coastal highway leading north from Viipuri towards Finland, on the shore of Kivisillansalmi on 22 June relieving the worn out troops. Having strong artillery support and support of the Gefechtsverband Kuhlmey the regiment was able to keep the Tienhaara region including the Kivisillansalmi while defending against repeated attacks by at least two Soviet divisions of the 108th Corps supported by strong artillery. At the conclusion of the battle on 25 June Marttinen was promoted to colonel. = Background = Soviet offensive begins = Deployment of IR61 at Tienhaara  Commanders  The following officers commanded the 61st Infantry Regiment: * June 1941 – September 1941: Colonel M.

It was a notable place of incarceration for political prisoners and war prisoners of the Second World War. The building of prison, built in 1840, is one of the oldest buildings in the city of Oryol. In 1941, the Oryol isolation prison contained some five thousand political prisoners. On 11 September 1941, just weeks before the occupation by German troops, by personal order of Joseph Stalin, 157 political prisoners incarcerated here were executed just outside Oryol, in the Medvedev Forest massacre. During the occupation by the Nazi Germany (since October 1941 to June 1943) here was established a concentration camp. After the Second World War, the Soviet authorities used it as a concentration camp for prisoners of war, among them being Dietrich von Saucken. Prisoners of war (from Germany, Hungary, Romania) were exterminated by starvation, shooting, exposure, and poisoning. A former prisoner, Latkovska-Wojtuskiewicz, described the scene at Easter in 1951 as \\"a veritable hell: the room was full of people, half-naked women languished and we, the new arrivals, wallowed on filthy straw, from which rose a stinking dust which choked one's breath.

It is most closely associated with Bo Xilai, who served as the city's Communist Party secretary from 2007 to 2012, though some policies were put in place by Bo's predecessors. The Chongqing model was characterized in part by increased state control and the promotion of a neo-leftist ideology. It involved a sweeping and sometimes extrajudicial campaign against organized crime, and increased the security and police presence in the city. As a means of addressing declining public morality, Bo launched a \\"red culture\\" movement to promote Maoist-era socialist ethics. On the economic front, he actively courted foreign investment and focused on manufacturing for domestic consumption. The Chongqing model was also characterized by massive public works programs, subsidized housing for the poor, and social policies intended to make it easier for rural citizens to move to the city. The Chongqing model represented an alternative model of development which diverged from the policies favored by the reformist faction led by Party general secretary Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. When Bo Xilai was removed from his posts in the spring of 2012, authorities began a campaign to reverse several of the policies that characterized the Chongqing model, including by cracking down on expressions of \\"red culture\\". Individuals, who believed they had been wrongly persecuted under the anti-corruption campaign, also began seeking legal redress. Background Bo Xilai, son of Communist Party icon Bo Yibo, was assigned as Communist Party secretary for Chongqing during the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. His predecessor, Wang Yang, was reassigned to helm the Communist Party in Guangdong province. At the time, Chongqing was reeling from problems such as air and water pollution, unemployment, poor public health, and complications from the Three Gorges Dam.U.S. consulate in Shanghai, \\"07SHANGHAI771, EAST CHINA CONTACTS ON LEADERSHIP CHANGES”. WikiLeaks, 4 December 2007. Prior to the appointment, Bo had served as Minister of Commerce. Bo was initially reluctant to assume the Chongqing post, which was widely viewed as a demotion; he had hoped to become vice-premier instead. Although Bo was initially unhappy about his reassignment as Communist Party secretary in Chongqing, he soon resolved to use his new position as a staging ground for a return to higher national office.Karson Yiu and Enjoli Frances, The Mysterious Saga of China’s Bo Xilai, ABC News, 19 April 2012. Bo made no secret of his desire to enter the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012, when seven of the nine members of the PSC—including General Secretary Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire.Ewing, Kent. (2010, 19 March). \\"Bo Xilai: China's Brash Populist\\". Asia Times. Retrieved on 16 June 2011. The transition would be an opportunity for the ambitious Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership, likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang, head of the party's security apparatus.The Economist, China's new leaders: the princelings are coming, 23 June 2011. Bo used his leadership of Chongqing to pioneer the \\"Chongqing Model\\"—a systematic set of social and economic policies intended to address diverse challenges facing modern China.Ian Johnson, China’s Falling Star, New York Review of Books, 19 March 2012. The Chongqing model represented a rebuke of the policies favored by the reformist faction dominated by Wen Jiabao and Hu Jintao. It is also frequently contrasted with the Guangdong model championed by Bo's predecessor and political opponent Wang Yang. Whereas the Chongqing model placed emphasized the role of the state in economic and social life, the Guangdong model is characterized by comparatively liberal economic and political policies.The Economist, The Guangdong model: One Chinese province adopts a beguilingly open approach—up to a point, 26 November 2011. Crackdown on organized crime Bo's tenure in Chongqing was dominated by a protracted war ostensibly against organized crime and corruption known as \\"Striking Black\\" (\\"Da Hei\\"). Since 2009, an estimated 5,700 people were arrested in the sweeping campaign that ensnared not only criminals, but also businessmen, members of the police force, judges, government officials, and political adversaries who were accused of corruption or criminal collaboration. The campaign was overseen by police chief and vice mayor Wang Lijun, whom Bo had worked with previously in Liaoning province. Reports from the Jamestown Foundation suggest the initiative was given approval by general secretary Hu Jintao, and Bo struck a careful balance between claiming credit for the campaign and praising Beijing's leadership in the crackdown on crime. The Striking Black campaign earned Bo national recognition and widespread popularity in Chongqing—all the more because of the city's reputation as a center for criminal activity. The apparent success of Bo's campaign raised Bo's national and international profile and resulted in calls for a nationwide campaign based on his experiences in Chongqing. Through the campaign, Bo gained the support of a number of powerful members of the Politburo Standing Committee, including Wu Bangguo, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping, and Zhou Yongkang, all of whom visited Chongqing or praised Bo's achievements sometime between 2010 and 2011. Bo's measures were criticized for neglecting due process and contributing to the erosion of the rule of law. \\"By all accounts,\\" wrote Stanley Lubman in The Wall Street Journal, the campaign \\"involved misuse of both the courts and the police.\\"Stanley Lubman, Bo Xilai’s Gift to Chongqing: A Legal Mess , The Wall Street Journal, 12 April 2012.

Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions. Moreover, many of those targeted in the campaign were not criminals, but businessmen and political rivals whose assets were reportedly seized in order to help pay for Bo's popular social housing programs. The Wall Street Journal reported estimates that $11 billion was seized through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, told The Financial Times that Chongqing security forces seized his $700 million real estate business and tortured him as retaliation for attempting to purchase land that was also sought by the government.Dan Levin and Michael Wines, Cast of Characters Grows, as Does the Intrigue, in a Chinese Political Scandal, The New York Times, 8 March 2012.Financial Times, Chinese infighting: Secrets of a succession war, 4 March 2012. One microblogger was sentenced to a year in labor camp for criticizing Bo's alleged abuse of the court system during the campaign. The campaign to combat crime and maintain political stability also involved the launch of a major electronic surveillance operation in the city. Wang Lijun, Bo's police chief, served as the architect of the state-funded project, which was described in official media as a \\"comprehensive package bugging system covering telecommunications to the Internet.\\"Jonathan Ansfield and Ian Johnson, Ousted Chinese Leader is Said to Have Spied on Other Top Officials, The New York Times, 26 April 2012. The system involved wiretaps, eavesdropping, and monitoring of internet communications. According to The New York Times, the eavesdropping operations did not only target local criminals, but also the communications of top Chinese leaders.Martin Patience, Bo Xilai scandal: China president ‘was wire-tapped’, 26 April 2012. In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo's orders. The revelation about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and contributed to Bo's downfall in 2012. Social policies Under Bo Xilai's administration, millions of trees were imported and planted in Chongqing as part of a campaign to \\"green\\" the city. A cornerstone of Bo's Chongqing model was a series of egalitarian social policies aimed at lessening the gap between rich and poor and easing the rural-urban divide. Bo promoted the notion of pursuing \\"red GDP\\"—an economic model embodying communist egalitarianism—and suggested that, if economic development were analogous to 'baking a cake', then the primary task should be to divide the cake fairly rather than building a larger cake. To that end, the city reportedly spent $15.8 billion on public apartment complexes for use by recent college graduates, migrant workers, and low-income residents. Bo aimed to provide housing for 2.4 million residents by 2012. Residents whose incomes were under 3,000 yuan ($480) per month would be eligible to rent apartments for three years, with an option to buy thereafter.Simon Montlake, Chongqing model up for grabs as party boss Bo exits, Forbes, 15 March 2012. Huang Qifan, who served as mayor under Bo Xilai, indicated in 2010 that the subsidized housing project was \\"designed to free up more money for people to consume and drive the economy,” and noted that it would borrow elements from Singapore's Housing Development Board. In 2007, the cities of Chongqing and Chengdu were selected to run pilot projects intended to mitigate the rural-urban divide and ease integration of rural residents into the cities. Under China's hukou registration system, citizens are classified as either rural or urban—a distinction that determines not only where they may live, but also affects educational opportunities, taxation, property rights, and so on. Of Chongqing's 32 million residents, only 27% held urban hukou certificates as of 2007. The 2007 project made it easier for rural residents to obtain urban status—a policy intended not only to help balance inequality, but also to enable the government to develop underused rural land. Under Bo's leadership, Chongqing established \\"land exchanges\\" where rural villages could earn credits for maximizing farmland.The Economist, Migration in China:Invisible and heavy shackles, 6 May 2010. Bo pledged to move three million rural residents into urban areas. Bo's populist approach to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes, which saw over 8,000 taxi drivers take to the streets for two days in protests over high fees, unregulated competition, and rising fuel charges. Similar protests in China are frequently suppressed—sometimes forcefully—with official media sometimes blaming labor unrest on criminal instigation.Stephen Wong, Taxi protests test China's tolerance, Asia Times Online, 11 December 2008. Bo's government instead held televised roundtable dialogues with the protesters and citizens, and agreed to allow the formation of a trade union. His handling of situation earned him praise as a comparatively progressive leader.Simon Elegant, China's Taxi Strikes: A Test for the Government, Time, 28 November 2008.Shai Oster, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122990342979025141.html, The Wall Street Journal, 22 December 2008. A businessman who was reportedly involved in organizing the strike was later sentenced on 20 years in prison for disrupting transport and gangsterism. The Chongqing model also involved a major campaign to \\"green\\" the city through a tree-planting initiative. The city reportedly imported millions of trees—many of them ginkos—as part of the campaign.The Economist, Problems with Trees: Plans to create greener cities are pruned, 12 May 2012. The cost of the greening initiative was estimated to be as high as 10 billion yuan.Lingling Wei and Dinny McMahon, Chinese Investigate Spending in Scandal, The Wall Street Journal, 19 April 2012. Red culture movement During his time in Chongqing, Bo initiated a series of Maoist-style campaigns to revive \\"red culture\\" and improve public morale. The initiative included the promotion of Maoist quotes, \\"singing red songs\\" (changhong), revolutionary television programming and operas, and initiatives to encourage students to work in the countryside, akin to the way students were required to do during the Down to the Countryside Movement of the Cultural Revolution.Branigan, Tania Red songs ring out in Chinese city's new cultural revolution, The Guardian, 22 April 2011. Prior to the 60th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China celebrations, for instance, Bo sent out \\"red text messages\\" to the city's 13 million cellphone users. According to Xinhua News Agency, Bo's text messages are usually quotes from Mao's Little Red Book, and include phrases such as \\"I like how Chairman Mao puts it: The world is ours, we will all have to work together,\\"2009年05月04日 光明日报/新华. Archived from the original on 15 March 2012. and \\"responsibility and seriousness can conquer the world, and the Chinese Communist Party members represent these qualities.\\"Ewing, Kent. (4 June 2011). \\"Mao's Army on the Attack\\". Asia Times. Retrieved on 16 June 2011. Bo and his team of municipal administrators also raised new Mao statues in Chongqing, while providing social housing to the city's less well-off. Some scholars have characterized this as an example of the revival of Maoism in the Chinese Communist ethos. In 2011, Bo and the city's Media Department initiated a \\"Red Songs campaign\\" that demanded every district, government department, commercial enterprise, educational institution, and state radio and TV station begin \\"singing red songs\\" praising the achievements of the Communist Party of China. Bo pledged to reinvigorate the city with Marxist ideals reminiscent of the Mao era.\\"Chinese city of 30m ordered to sing 'red songs'\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 20 April 2011《走向复兴》等36首红歌]. 20 April 2011. Archived from the original on 15 March 2012. Associated Press. \\"'Red Songs' fuels Chinese politician's ambitions\\". 3 March 2011, Fox NewsAgence France-Presse. \\"Chongqing orders citizens to sing 'red songs'\\". South China Morning Post, 20 April 2011 Reactions to the red culture movement were divided. Bo's revival of Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within certain segments of society, and made Bo popular with both Marxists and neo-leftists. One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign, saying, \\"When I sing red songs, I find a kind of spirit I never felt when singing modern songs …To surround yourself with material stuff is just a waste of time.\\"Keith B. Richburg, China’s ‘red culture’ revival unwelcome reminder to some, The Washington Post, 29 June 2011. A group of retired participants in a red song routine told the Los Angeles Times \\"We know these songs from our youth. We grew up with revolutionary spirit and we want to pass that on to our children.” Another noted that he felt compelled to participate in order to express appreciation to the Communist Party for the country's strong economy.Barbara Demick, ‘Red song’ campaign in China strikes some false notes’, Los Angeles Times, 3 June 2011. However, the campaign was unsettling to others—particularly the intelligentsia. A 57-year-old lawyer told The Washington Post, \\"I saw the beatings of the teachers by the Red Guards. It was horrible …Young people may not recognize it. But for us who lived through it, how can we possibly sing?\\" An academic quoted in The Daily Telegraph described the mandatory campaign as akin to being \\"drowned in a Red sea.\\"Malcolm Moore, Neil Heywood death in China: Bo Xilai ‘drowned Chongqing in a sea of Red terror’, The Daily Telegraph, 17 April 2012. In September 2009, a mid-level official in the city committed suicide after being pressured to organize his work unit to participate in the red songs campaign. The official, Xie Dajun, reportedly disagreed with the campaign, which evoked painful memories of the Cultural Revolution. Bo's critics and opponents derisively referred to him as \\"little Mao,\\" with some expressing concern about the resemblance of the red culture campaign to the Cultural Revolution.Rosemary Righter, Bo Xilai’s Sacking Signals Showdown In China’s Communist Party, Newsweek, 15 March 2012. Economic policies A view of the Chongqing skyline, 2011. Another major component of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies. Just as he had done in Liaoning province, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowered corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. The Chongqing model also placed emphasis on the importance of state- owned enterprises; in 2010, Bo stressed that China \\"[needs] to have things that are state-owned.\\"Economist, Chongqing rolls on: A city’s deposed leader had tried to be different. But was he?, 28 April 2012. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.Bo Zhiyue and Chen Gang, Bo Xilai and the Chongqing Model , East Asia Institute, Background Brief No. 465 (July 2009). Several major corporations built or greatly expanded their manufacturing operations in Chongqing, including Hewlett-Packard, Foxconn, Ford motors, and BASF. Bo's model of economic growth won national and international praise, but it also had its detractors. In particular, the so-called \\"red GDP\\" of subsidized infrastructure, housing and public works projects were criticized for running up the city's budget deficits. A former head of a Chongqing business association told The Daily Telegraph that under Bo, \\"lots of officials were not getting their salaries on time, getting an IOU instead. Eventually the economy was going to break.\\" Chongqing received a disproportionately higher share of stimulus money from the central government in 2008, with $34 billion going to the city. Political rivals such as Bo's predecessor Wang Yang also suggested that economic figures such as those in Chongqing were \\"rigged\\"—artificially inflated through unnecessary construction and public works projects.Melinda Liu, China and the Fights Within its Single Party, Newsweek, 25 September 2009. Reassessments Bo Xilai's political fortunes came to an abrupt end when his police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to the American consulate in Chengdu hoping to gain political asylum.Michael Wines and Jonathan Ansfield, Report on Ousted China Official Shows Effort at Damage Control, The New York Times, 19 March 2012. Wang reportedly provided the consulate with information on Bo's alleged misconduct, including his role obstructing investigations into the homicide of British citizen and Bo family associate Neil Heywood. In the fallout, Bo was removed as Chongqing party chief in March 2012 and suspended from the politburo in April 2012.Reuters, \\"Bo Xilai suspended from Chinese Communist Party top ranks\\", 10 April 2012. Following the removal of Bo Xilai from his official positions, Chinese leaders began an effort to discredit him.Edward Wong and Jonathan Ansfield, Master of the Media Spotlight Is Now Its Victim in China, The New York Times, 21 April 2012. On 14 March, Premier Wen Jiabao reprimanded Bo during his annual press conference.\\"Bo Xilai 'removed' from Chongqing post: China state media\\". BBC News, 15 March 2012. Retrieved 15 March 2012. Wen called the achievements of Chongqing \\"significant,\\" but the result of \\"multiple administrations,\\" rather than just Bo himself. Wen also made numerous allusions to the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution—an indirect rebuke of Bo's efforts to revive \\"red culture\\". Apparently wary of the associations to the Cultural Revolution, a campaign was launched cracking down on expressions of \\"red culture\\" that Bo had championed.Barbara Demick, China puts a stop to Maoist revival, Los Angeles Times, 20 March 2012. The crypto-Maoist campaign of singing red songs is also likely to be stopped. However, other aspects of the Chongqing model—in particular the egalitarian social policies, subsidized education and low- income housing projects—drew grassroots and popular support. At least in this regard, the successes of the Chongqing Model are likely to be remembered and studied, according to analyst Wu Zhong. Critics asserted in the aftermath of Bo's removal that the \\"Striking Black\\" campaign against organized crime and corruption may have been policy a \\"political ploy designed to cast a negative light on his predecessor and political opponent, Wang Yang, and take advantage of popular resentment against corruption\\". Following Bo's removal, Chongqing's new vice mayor He Ting signaled that the city's security force would be overhauled. Some legal scholars and activists expressed hope that the forced labor sentences meted out under Bo might be reexamined.Kathrin Hille, Chongqing in limbo after Bo Xilai downfall, Financial Times, 29 March 2012. A collection of civil rights lawyers led by Liu Yang circulated an open letter online suggesting a review of criminal sentences under Bo's administration. Soon thereafter, Liu was reportedly instructed to desist in these efforts by the Beijing Bureau of Legal Affairs. The Washington Post reported that several relatives of individuals detained amidst the campaign began been seeking legal counsel from prominent civil rights lawyers—including Beijing-based Li Zhuang—in hopes of having the sentences overturned. The first person to petition for redress was Fang Hong, a dissident blogger who had been sent to one year in a labor camp for writing a poem mocking Bo. In May 2012, Fang filed to have his guilty verdict overturned, and sought compensation from the court.Isolda Morillo and Christopher Bodeen, China blogger seeking redress over labor camp term, Associated Press, 8 May 2012. His appeal was successful, with a Chongqing court ruling in late June 2012 that there was an insufficient evidence to justify his detention.BBC, China blogger who mocked Bo Xilai online wins case, 29 June 2012. Authorities also launched investigations into the city's spending policies, including the costly tree-planting campaign. Shortly after Bo's removal from his Chongqing party post, the city's finance bureau and economic planning office reportedly issued an urgent notice to government and party officials in the city to \\"clean up\\" investment projects. An official with the city's finance bureau indicated the investigation would focus on \\"how the money was raised, spent and managed.\\" However, The Wall Street Journal reported that it was \\"unclear whether the scrutiny of Chongqing's spending stems from concern about potential wrongdoing or the city's debt burden, or whether it is primarily a politically motivated attempt to attack Mr. Bo's 'Chongqing model.'\\" Yang Fan, a leading \\"new left\\" scholar at China University of Political Science and Law and co-author of the book The Chongqing Model, also signaled that a reassessment of the Chongqing model would be in order, saying \\"since a big scandal has hit Chongqing, it is imperative that we take a second look at the Chongqing Model\\". Bo's downfall, and the subsequent reassessments of the Chongqing model, has been viewed by some commentators as a victory for Wang Yang's Guangdong model. In assessing the fall-out, John Wagner Givens wrote that \\"If there is a hope among China's leadership, it might be Mr. Bo's predecessor Wang Yang. While Mr. Wang may not have Bo's populist flair, he appears to have made some real, though small, political reforms.\\" Wu Jinglian, a Chinese liberal economist, and Sun Jian, a researcher at the Communist party journal Seeking Truth, warned that vested interest blocs, such as the Gang of Princelings, should not block or unwind current reform. Zhou Lian, an associate professor of philosophy at Renmin University of China, and Ai Weiwei, an artist in Beijing, have publicly criticized Bo and his Chongqing Model for being wrong and lowering trust. Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the \\"Striking Black\\" policy, said that \\"the Chongqing model is problematic because the city's leaders do not follow the rule of law\\". According to Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University, \\"the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime\\". Furthermore, he said, “All the worst things you ever imagined are actually true” and “It’s not like nobody knew about this stuff, but now they know that it really is true and it’s as bad as it can possibly be.” Zhang Musheng, an economist and journalist, is leading a new movement and is gaining followers for a plan to add checks and balances to the Communist Party and to significantly increase welfare benefits. Populists want to remake the party to reflect Chairman Mao's early vision. However, Mao-style populism is hated by most current older Chinese leaders, and Bo, its leading advocate, was destroyed by scandal. Because of this, few commentators expect China to willingly remake itself soon. And even those within the elite prepared to discuss major changes, including the second-generation \\"Gang of Princelings\\", have an interest in protecting the status quo.

It is assigned to the United States Seventh Fleet. Command history=1920-1922 Destroyer Squadron 7 (DesRon 7) was first established in September 1920 as a reserve squadron of 15 destroyers homeported at Charleston, South Carolina (USA). The squadron was deactivated in July 1922. 1939-1945 In April 1939, DesRon 7 was reactivated at Naval Base San Diego, California. In December 1940, the squadron was reformed at Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island. It was equipped with newly built Benson- and Gleaves-class destroyers between June and September 1940. In December 1940, DesRon 7 consisted of the Destroyer Divisions (DesDiv) 13 and 14 with the following ships: *, flag *Destroyer Division 13 **, flag *Destroyer Division 14 **, flag Between March and December 1941, DesRon 7 operated 31 in the \\"Atlantic Convoy Support Force\\" from Argentia, Newfoundland and Iceland with the Wickes- and s of DesRon 30 and DesRon 31. During these “short-of-war” operations, Niblack fired the first U.S. depth charges of the war on 10 April 1941 (on the German submarine U-52), while rescuing survivors the Dutch cargo ship Saleier. On 31 October, Niblack and Hilary P. Jones rescued 45 survivors of which was sunk by a torpedo attack from German submarine U-552 near Iceland on 31 October 1941. On 3 September 1942, while escorting Convoy TA-18, bound for New York City, a large fire broke out aboard the troop transport . Mayo and the light cruiser closed to windward to take off passengers, a badly-burned officer, and members of the crew not needed to man pumps and hoses. Other survivors were disembarked by boat and raft, to be picked up forthwith by the screening ships, among them Niblack and Hilary P. Jones. DesRon 7 continued to serve in the Atlantic Ocean until the Allied invasion of Sicily in August 1943, when Plunkett and Gleaves accepted the surrender of the small island of Ustica in the Tyrrhenian Sea. The following month, Plunkett and the ships of DesDiv 13 operated in the screen of the Southern Attack Force during the Allied invasion of Italy. On 9 October 1943, Gleaves and a British LCT rescued 57 survivors of which had been sunk by the German submarine U-616 off the coast of Salerno when it was working in support of Operation Avalanche. DesDiv13 (less Benson) operated with the multinational Task Force 81 in “Operation Shingle,” the landings at Anzio, in January 1944. While providing fire support, Mayo succeeded in breaking up a German counterattack 23 January, before she was heavily damaged by a mine the following day. Plunkett suffered major damage from a bomb hit on the same day. On 20 April 1944, Lansdale was torpedoed and sunk by German bombers off the coast of Algeria while escorting Convoy UGS-37. Gleaves and Hilary P. Jones sank the German submarine U-616 with other ships and aircraft off Spain on 17 May 1944. Afterwards they rescued 53 members of her crew. Niblack and Ludlow sank the German submarine U-960 north-west of Algiers with gunfire on 19 May 1944. In August and September 1944, DesDiv 13 participated Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France. Hilary P. Jones provided gunfire support missions during the assault, but also acted as electronic jamming vessel in the successful attempt to prevent radio-controlled bombs from harassing the area. In the weeks that followed she continued to range up and down the coast in support of the First Airborne Task Force destroying bridges, gun emplacements, railroad facilities and coastal vessels. She was attacked by a German E-boat 21 August, but destroyed the craft with gunfire. For her outstanding record during this period the ship received the Navy Unit Commendation. Convoy duty and overhauls followed these actions. In the spring of 1945, DesRon 7 was transferred to the Pacific Ocean, where it was mainly engaged in escort duties. Benson, Mayo, Madison and Hilary P. Jones entered Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945 during the surrender ceremony. Returning to the United States, DesRon 7 was deactivated in November 1945. 1946 - present In January 1946, DesRon 60 was redesignated DesRon 7. Ships of the squadron participated in Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. The squadron saw extended action during the Korean War, including the Battle of Inchon. During the Vietnam War, the squadron was deployed in support of Operation Market Time and engaged in shore bombardments. In January and February 1979, DesRon 7 participated in the evacuation of Americans from Iran during the Iranian Revolution. During the 1991 Gulf War, the commander of DesRon 7 acted as the \\"North Arabian Gulf Local Anti-Surface Warfare Commander\\" and directed multi-national forces in offensive operations which eliminated the Iraqi Navy. In 1994-2003, DesRon 7 was assigned the battle group of the aircraft carrier . In 1992, 1994, 1997 and 1999, DesRon 7 participated in Operation Southern Watch in the Arabian Gulf. In 2002, the following ships were assigned to DesRon 7:   * From 2004 to 2012, DesRon 7 was assigned to the battle group of the newly commissioned aircraft carrier .

Events of Tasu'a The following are the main events of Tasu'a: Shemr's entrance to Karbala In the forenoon of Tasu'a, Shemr, accompanied by a four thousand-man army, arrived at Karbala. He brought a letter from Ubayd Ullah ibn Ziyad to Umar ibn Sa'ad, telling him to take Bay'ah from Husayn or fight. Safe conduct for the children of Umm ul-Banin Shemr was one of the tribesman of Umm ul-Banin. He was given a guarantee of safe conduct from Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad for children of Umm ul-Banin in Tasu'a. He asked Abbas ibn Ali and his brothers to abandon Husayn ibn Ali and obey Yazid. Abbas didn't accept his safe conduct and answered him: \\"God curse you and your safe conduct! You give us safe conduct and you do not give safe conduct to the grandson of the Prophet of God? And you are asking us to enter the obedience of the cursed people and those who are children of cursed people?\\" Preparing for war After rejection of the safe conduct by Abbas and his brothers, Umar ibn Sa'ad ordered his army to attack Husayn's camp. When Husayn ibn Ali understood their intent, he asked his brother to go to them and ask about his plan. Abbas ibn Ali, Zuhayr ibn Qayn, Habib ibn Madhahir and a few others went and asked them. They answered that our governor ordered us to ask you to Bay'ah him and his rule or fight. Abbas returned to Husayn and said their message. \\"Go back to them and ask them to give us this evening as a respite till tomorrow so that we may pray to our Lord, supplicate to Him, and seek His forgiveness, for He knows how much I love prayers, the recitation of His Book, the abundance of invocations, and the seeking of His forgiveness\\", Husayn said to Abbas. Abbas went back to the army and said them the message. Umar Ibn Sa'ad agreed to delay the war until the next day. Siege of Karbala In a Hadith by Ja'far al-Sadiq it is said: \\"Ninth of Muharram is the day, when Imam Husayn and his companions were besieged at Karbala by the army of Syria from all sides and offloaded their luggage. The son of Marjanah (Ubaydullah bin Ziyad) and Umar ibn Sa’ad were pleased at the large number of their army and they deemed Imam and his companions to be weak. They knew that Imam Husayn had no helpers or aides in Iraq. May my father be ransom upon the oppressed traveler.\\" Rituals The day of Tasu'a, in Iran (Ardabil) In the days of Ashura and Tasua, Muslims go to mosques and Takiehs or go to mourning ceremonies. They recite Ahadith and poems in honor of Abbas ibn Ali. In general, the mourning ceremonies consist of processions, chanting and self-flagellation. One of the oldest and most common traditions among Muslims is to wish for something from Allah while also promising to feed people. In Iran this tradition is well- established and reaches its climax on Tasua and Ashura (the 9th and 10th of Muharram) when mourners are fed. Ta'zieh as a religious play is an old traditional practice for mourning in some cities and villages.

PHOX's self-titled debut LP was released on June 24, 2014. History Prior to the formation of PHOX, many eventual members collaborated with Zach Johnston for his album Sonntag, which was written in California, but recorded in Wisconsin. Some time later while Matt Holmen was playing with Davey Roberts, Matt Roberts (keys), and Jason Krunnfusz (bass) in Baraboo. The group connected once again for what was originally thought to be a one-off show at the local event, Boo Bash on May 4, 2011. The group still needed songs to play and someone to sing them. Monica Martin was asked if she'd sing some tracks from Sonntag and some cover songs at the event and she agreed. Moving forward, Monica wrote lyrics and melodies, and the group arranged the songs from their first two EP's and their self-titled first record release. The band released their EP Confetti in early 2013, for which they created a video component for each track. 2013 also saw a Daytrotter session, positive press, a spot at South by Southwest and a national tour opening for Blitzen Trapper. The band played Lollapalooza as a last-minute addition in August 2013, drawing a large crowd despite their midday spot. In September 2013 PHOX opened for The Lumineers at Apple's iTunes Festival in London. Local Wisconsin publication Isthmus praised PHOX as one of the year's greatest musical success stories. Throughout 2015, Phox supported Paolo Nutini and The Head and the Heart, while also headlining around the U.S. non-stop. They also made their debut in New Zealand and Australia during March 2015. They were also featured on NPR Music's Tiny Desk Concert. Other notable festival stops include Coachella, Bonnaroo, Firefly, Summerfest, Sasquatch, and the inaugural Eaux Claires Music and Arts Festival where they also screened their latest [mockumentary] film titled, Amor Fati, directed by member Zach Johnston. The film was uploaded publicly to YouTube on December 24, 2015. The band is currently signed to Partisan Records, and are managed by Foundations Artist Management. They recorded their first full-length, self-titled album at April Base – Justin Vernon's home studio in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. PHOX announced an indefinite hiatus on October 17, 2016. The band played their farewell concert at the Al. Ringling Theatre in their hometown of Baraboo, WI on February 4, 2017.

Founded in 1934, the firm has a national reputation for its insurance industry work, its representation of professionals and law firms, and its closely coordinated business advisory, transactional and litigation services. History=Origins In the 1930s, after saving up $300, Joseph Howard Hinshaw,Joseph Howard Hinshaw - Historical Profile http://www.rawbw.com/~hinshaw/cgi- bin/id?738 a World War I veteran and legendary trial lawyer, decided to establish his own law firm. In 1934, Hinshaw and James G. Culbertson, a renowned banking and corporate transactional lawyer who was referred by Clarence Darrow, began a law firm partnership on LaSalle Street in Chicago called \\"Hinshaw & Culbertson.\\" The unique coupling of Hinshaw's trial experience and Culbertson's \\"flair for the numbers\\" was a potent force. Early Expansion In 1963, the firm opened its second office in Wheaton, Illinois. The firm continued to open offices throughout Illinois and the surrounding states of Missouri and Wisconsin. Hinshaw, Culbertson, Moelmann, Hoban & Fuller By the mid-1980s, the firm had established groups specializing in appeals, corporate law, health care law, insurance coverage, labor and employment law, legal malpractice, medical malpractice, products liability, and real estate. During this time, the firm began its expansion beyond the midwest, opening an office in Miami, Florida. That period of expansion—and the formative years that preceded it—saw several new faces join the firm. The firm's name expanded in kind. From 1980 to 1993, the firm had five name partners and was known as \\"Hinshaw, Culbertson, Moelmann, Hoban & Fuller.\\" One of those additional name partners, John M. Moelmann,John M.

He first began his practice with Hinshaw in 1938 and eventually became a managing partner of the firm. In that role, he shepherded much of Hinshaw's early growth until he retired in 1979. The fifth name partner, Perry Fuller,Perry L. Fuller Obituary http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-05-20/news/0705190620_1_mr-fuller- chicago-crime-commission-mentored was a protégé of Hinshaw.

Following in the steps of his mentor, Fuller imparted his own knowledge to countless lawyers in the firm for more than 40 years. Hoban's efforts toward growing the firm were continued and expanded upon by Dennis M. Horan,Dennis M.

The cartoon was thought to be lost but was rediscovered in 2004. Plot Krazy is spending some time at a house with a human boy. The boy suddenly gets bored and starts crying. To entertain his friend, Krazy shows him a ball, but the boy just kicks it away in apathy. When the cat asks what the boy wants, the bawling boy wishes for Santa Claus to pay them a visit. Krazy then sets off towards the North Pole to fulfill his friend's wish. On his journey to find Santa, Krazy enters what looks like a subway station in the city. He goes through a secret passage inside and eventually reaches the exit at the Arctic. He then tries to ask the locals for directions, starting with what he thinks is an Eskimo. It turns out the \\"Eskimo\\" is a vicious polar bear which chases him. To lose the bruin from behind, Krazy constructs a sled with a sail on top. It is a smooth ride until he runs off the edge of a chasm. At the bottom of the chasm, Krazy finds a turntable and a record. He plays the record on the player and dances, attempting to carol someone out of an igloo. Unfortunately, no one comes out. While he is still standing and thinking what to do, a hostile sea lion hurls a snow ball at him. The impact sends him bouncing into an Eskimo woman. The Eskimo woman responds by hurling Krazy back to the sea lion. The cartoon concludes with the sea lion having fun in rebounding the airborne feline.

A multi-layer coating consisting of alternating layers with different optical properties and the same thickness will tend to have a narrow frequency response, getting narrower as more layers are added; for some applications such as precise focussing of a monochromatic laser light source this is exactly what's desired, but it is useless for astronomical optics where it is often required to detect a whole range of frequencies emitted by some source of interest. The design of such coatings generally starts with an approximate analytical solution and then uses the simplex method of multi-variable optimisation to solve for optimal thicknesses of the layers. Typically the thin layers (to reflect high-energy X-rays) are on the inside since low-energy X-rays are absorbed more readily. One model used is a power law distribution of thicknesses, with the thickness of the ith bilayer as a/(b+i)^c for some optimised a, b, c. An optimum multilayer design depends on the graze angle, so ideally a different prescription would be used on each shell of a multi-shell X-ray Wolter mirror; in practice the same prescription is used for about ten shells. Characterising such coatings requires a synchrotron as a variable- wavelength X-ray source. The Danish Space Research Institute in Copenhagen is (in 2012) the world centre of excellence for such coatings, though a good deal of the earlier research and development was done in Russia.

Damaged in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and red-stickered after the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the building was threatened with demolition like most other central city heritage buildings. In June 2012, it was announced that the building will be saved, repaired and earthquake strengthened. Geography {  State Insurance  Old Government Building } The Octagon is located on the south-west corner of Worcester and Manchester Streets. The three buildings on the south side of the section of Worcester Street leading into Cathedral Square are all registered heritage buildings and together, they form an important setting. The neighbouring buildings are the State Insurance Building, an art deco office tower designed by Cecil Wood and registered as Category II, and the Old Government Building designed by Joseph Maddison and registered as Category I. History The church tower with bracing after the September 2010 Canterbury earthquake The tower collapsed in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. ;Early beginnings The Congregational church was brought to New Zealand by Barzillai Quaife. Congregationalists had their first meeting in Christchurch in 1861. Meetings were held at Bonnington's Hall until July 1864, when that property changed hands and was no longer available. A society was formed, four members raised funds (Samuel Farr, Mr Gee, James Jameson and Mr Lewis) and members bought the property on the south-west corner of the Manchester and Worcester Streets intersection for a church. Farr was chosen as the architect for the original church and the affairs were progressed by the first minister, William Habens. The original church, built in stone, was opened with a series of opening services starting on 23 November 1864. By 1870, the church had become too small for the congregation, and there were problems with ventilation. Four architects were invited to provide designs for a new building: Farr, Benjamin Mountfort, William Armson and Robert Lawson. Although Farr was a Deacon of the Trinity Congregational Church and had designed the first church, the design of Mountfort was chosen, who was a devout Anglican. Farr's name is listed on the foundation stone as the church's Deacon. Mountfort was given the requirement of an open preaching space, which he met by choosing an Early French rather than a High Gothic style. For this reason, the church has a large gallery at the northern end, so that the minister could be seen by all attending a service. Stylistically, the church shares many design elements with Canterbury Museum, which was also Mountfort's work and which was built in stages starting in 1870. ;Pacific Islanders' Congregational Church The church began to be also used by the Pacific Islanders' Congregational Church in the 1960s, and the congregations formally merged in 1968. In 1969, the Congregational church and the Presbyterian church combined throughout New Zealand as part of a worldwide trend under the auspices of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. In Christchurch, the Trinity-Pacific Congregational Church joined with the Presbyterian congregation of St Paul's Church in Cashel Street. ;State Trinity Centre Financial pressure led to the sale of Trinity Congregational Church in 1974 to the State Insurance, who own the building immediately to the west of the church. The insurance called the building the State Trinity Centre. Trinity Congregational Church was used as a performing arts centre for the community. The new owners undertook significant earthquake strengthening, with the walls internally extended by adding a layer of reinforced concrete. Consent to have the tower earthquake strengthened was declined by the Historic Places Trust, as it was necessary to temporarily remove the tower's roof. The modified building opened to the public on 22 November 1975. For years, Christchurch pupils would sit their piano exams at Trinity. Ownership changed to private individuals and the building was used as a wedding chapel for Japanese tourists who wanted to get married in Christchurch. ;The Octagon Alan Slade bought the building in 1993 while on holiday in Christchurch. The owner of a wedding business in Australia already owned several churches, but he was awed by the internal beauty of the Trinity Congregational Church, especially the timber ceiling. His wife described the spontaneous purchase as one undertaken \\"by a guy with a big heart and very little brain\\". Restoration work took 13 years in total and in 2006, they opened the restaurant. It was both a restaurant and a training venue for music students. The students worked at the restaurant, trained in music during times the restaurant was closed, and performed for the diners while the restaurant was open. The restaurant's name, The Octagon, makes reference to the octagonal floor plan of the church. The church was damaged in the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake and the tower braced with an external steel structure; it was a much photographed item for its decoration with mannequins. Within two months, the restaurant was operating again. The building suffered further damage by the strong aftershock on Boxing Day of that year that was centred underneath the central city. Within two days, the restaurant opened again. In the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the tower collapsed. The engineer who had designed the 1975/76 strengthening work had only recently warned that the tower was \\"severely compromised\\". Slade blamed that the consenting authorities (Christchurch City Council and the New Zealand Historic Places Trust) were responsible for much of the loss of Christchurch's historic buildings due to their bureaucratic attitudes, which prevented much earthquake strengthening work from going ahead due to it being too intrusive. Slade, who had spent NZ$500,000 on remedial work prior to the February earthquake, had run out of funds and had reluctantly applied for the building to be demolished. In June 2012, it was announced that the building will be saved, repaired and earthquake strengthened. In the 2012 Canterbury Heritage Awards, the building won the Heritage Retention Award, and the Supreme Award. In March 2013, Christchurch City Council's community, recreation and culture committee voted to give NZ$1m towards the restoration and strengthening costs. Architecture Mountfort had designed other stone churches previously, but Trinity Congregational was the first to be built. Stone rubble walls are contrasted with Oamaru stone, which results in a striking juxtaposition of building materials, with most visual impact on the saddleback tower. The floor plan of the church is octagonal. The timber roof structure is a double barrel vault, which is regarded as an elegant solution to roofing over such a floor plan. The overall appearance of the building is Gothic. Heritage registration The building was registered as a heritage building by Heritage New Zealand on 2 April 1985 with registration number 306 classified as B. With the change of the classification system, the building later became a Category I listing.

The 1952 Tour with Laurel & Hardy In 1952 the Lonsdale's worked as a support act for Laurel & Hardy during their 9-month-long tour of the United Kingdom through 28 towns and cities, performing an average of 14 shows a week. As well as always opening the show with their “Rhythm” dance routine and performing after the shows interval the Lonsdale's would also work as the Great Cingalee's assistants in his magic act. As well as the Lonsdale Sisters there were 7 other acts on the programme with the final act being a comedy sketch performed by Laurel & Hardy entitled “A Spot of Trouble” During the long tour Laurel & Hardy developed a close friendship with the Lonsdale Sisters. When the tour came to an end Laurel & Hardy returned to America but would keep in contact with the girls often sending them hand written letters & signed photos with personal messages to Pauline, Florence & their families. Laurel & Hardy would regularly read the variety paper to check on their old touring buddies lives and would send hand written letters of congratulations to the girls during special occasions like Pauline's wedding and the birth of the girl's children. Some of these pictures and letters can be seen in the book A Spot of Trouble in Southend which makes a detailed in-depth account of Laurel & Hardy's performance in Southend on August 1952. Life after the Lonsdale Sister=Florence Samuels The Lonsdale Sisters career was finished towards the end of 1953 when Florence took time off from the stage due to her being pregnant with her second child, she gave birth to her second son in 1954 and made the difficult decision to turn her back on showbiz and concentrate on being a full-time mother and wife. Florence Samuels lived out the rest of her life in the seaside town of Cleethorpes in North East Lincolnshire and never returned to the stage. Pauline Cingalee After giving birth to her first daughter in 1955 Pauline followed in her father's footsteps and returned to the stage as a magician working under her new stage name Paula Lee. Her magic went on to be seen on stage in clubs, cabaret shows and on television. Keeping with family tradition Pauline went on to perform with her two daughters. The act of Paula Lee, Claudi and Shelli became a permanent trio from 1974 till 1982.

Born in New Haven, Connecticut where he attended the Hopkins Grammar School, continued his academic studies at Yale College and obtained his medical degree at the Boston University. After completing his general surgery training at McGill's Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, he returned to the Yale School of Medicine to complete his neurosurgical residency at Yale New Haven Hospital, West Haven Veteran's Administration Hospital, and Hartford Hospital, along with fellowships in neurophysiology and neuro-pathology. During that time, Apuzzo obtained training in nuclear, submarine and deep sea diving medical specialties at the Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut. Military service Following training in Groton, Connecticut, he served as a medical and deep sea diving officer on the USS Robert E. Lee (SSBN-601), one of the original five nuclear-powered fleet ballistic missile submarines as a part of submarine Squadron 14 based in Holy Loch, Scotland. This squadron was assigned to implement the deterrent mission of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), serving as a submarine platform for sixteen Polaris A-3 multiple nuclear warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles. This duty consisted of multiple 90- to 120-day submerged patrols to polar regions, the Mediterranean Sea, and Black Sea.Apuzzo ML, Pagán VM, Faccio R, Liu CY.

In 1991, he was appointed editor-in-chief of the peer-reviewed journal Neurosurgery. He established the web-based \\"Neurosurgery-Online\\" and later \\"Operative Neurosurgery\\" during his term as editor-in-chief. When he completed his term in 2009, he was asked to found the society sponsored peer-reviewed journal \\"World Neurosurgery\\" and \\"worldneurosurgery.org\\" by the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS), a position which he fulfilled brilliantly with artistic creativity and scientific expertise, until January 2015, when he stepped down. Internationalism and education He has served as an advocate for international exchange of ideas. In 1989, as scientific program chair, he introduced an increased presence of international faculty and participation in the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) Annual Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana. This practice was subsequently developed and perpetuated by the major North American neurosurgical groups in succeeding decades. As editor of Neurosurgery, he established an extensive international advisory board and increased international participation in the review and publication processes. He subsequently traveled actively internationally initiating idea exchange and the sharing of information globally both personally and through the exploitation of digital technologies early in their availability. He subsequently was awarded membership in more than 25 international organizations. Based on these contributions, he was awarded the Founders' Laurel Award by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) at their annual meeting in 2014. Sports He has served as the principal neurosurgical consultant for the University of Southern California Trojans Athletic Department and the New York Football Giants, as well as, a consultant to the NFL Commissioner and the Leagues committee on head and spinal trauma. Additionally, he has served as adviser to the National Football Leagues Committee on Head Injury. He is also a consultant to the activities of various teams and clubs of the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Hockey League (NHL) and the National Basketball Association (NBA). Beginning in 1978, based on the legacy of University of Michigan's Richard C. Schnieder, he initiated activities to establish the role of neurosurgery in the arena of organized sport. Initially at the University of Southern California, he established an active role in the areas of head protection, injury prevention, assessment and treatment with athletic trainer Byron Hansen and later Russ Romano and a succession of coaches and athletic directors at that institution. Subsequently, he worked to establish injury management protocols with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Football League (NFL).

Independent senior living communities commonly provide apartments, but some also offer cottages, condominiums, and single-family homes. Residents include seniors who do not require assistance with daily activities or 24/7 skilled nursing, but may benefit from convenient services, senior-friendly surroundings, and increased social opportunities that independent senior living communities offer. Independent senior living communities are also popular among snowbird seniors who wish to downsize or travel freely without the burden of managing a home. Many retirement communities offer dining services, basic housekeeping and laundry services, transportation to appointments and errands, activities, social programs, and access to exercise equipment. Some also offer emergency alert systems, live-in managers, and amenities like pools, spas, clubhouses, and on-site beauty and barber salons. Independent senior living properties do not provide health care or assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) such as medication, bathing, eating, dressing, toileting and more. Independent senior living differs from continuing care communities, which offer independent living along with multiple other levels of care, such as assisted living and skilled nursing, in one single residence. Independent senior living residents are permitted to use third-party home health care services to meet additional needs. The total operational resident capacity for independent senior living communities in the United States is 245,000. Holiday Retirement is the largest single provider of independent living with a resident capacity of 40,440 at 315 retirement communities throughout the U.S. and Canada. Types * Senior Apartments: Most common type of independent senior living. Services usually include recreational programs, transportation, and meals service. * Housing Units: Senior communities that offer single-family homes, duplexes, mobile homes, townhouses, cottages, or condominiums. Some communities are tied to an adjoining, apartment-style independent senior living community. Residents may have the option to rent or buy. * Continuing Care: Communities that provide access to independent living communities, as well as assisted living and skilled nursing. Residents can transfer among levels of care as needs change. Some CCRCs also provide memory care facilities. * Subsidized Housing: The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides communities for low-income seniors. Subsidized communities usually adhere to strict criteria and may have lengthy waiting lists. * Naturally Occurring Retirement Community (NORC): A community that has a large population of senior residents but was not originally designed for seniors. These evolve naturally as people age-in- place over time or migrate into the same area. They are not created to meet the needs of seniors. * Co-Care: Residents live with three other older adults in a four-bedroom, two-bathroom unit. Each unit has a small kitchen and space for laundry, living and dining, reducing costs for middle income seniors.Senior Housing News on Co-Care Typical residents A typical independent senior living community resident is a person 55 and older who is mentally and physically capable of living alone without skilled nursing or assistance with day-to-day activities. Some residents may need assistance with a few activities of daily living and can obtain third-party home health care services. Seniors who may benefit from less home upkeep and increased access to nutritious meals, social interaction, physical and mental stimulation, and transportation make ideal independent senior living community residents. Vs. assisted living The most significant difference between assisted living and independent senior living is the care provided. Residents of assisted living facilities require assistance with daily activities like medication, eating, bathing, dressing, and toileting. Residents of a purpose-built independent senior living complex have taken an active decision to improve their quality of life by living in a secure, low maintenance home. Elderly people who have chosen to live in assisted retirement complex will often require more care and support to improve their quality of life. There are around 50,000 private senior living developments in the UK alone, which is insufficient to meet the demand from an increasing number of retirees. It has been predicted that by 2020, 19.3% of the UK population will be aged 65 and a minimum of 35,000 new senior living development properties will need to be created to meet housing demands. Independent senior living residents are able to live on their own with limited assistance (provided by third-party home health care providers if needed) and without around-the-clock supervision. Neither assisted living nor senior independent living communities offer 24/7 skilled nursing that is provided at nursing homes. Cost Independent senior living communities are the least expensive of the three primary senior living options. Monthly costs vary significantly by community type, size of apartment, location and services offered. The average total cost for a U.S. one bedroom independent senior living apartment is $2,750 per month. In 2011, the average rate for a private bedroom at a U.S. nursing home was $239 per day, or nearly $7,270 per month. Average rate for a private bedroom at an assisted living community was $3,477 per month. Continuing care communities require an entrance fee that ranges from $20,000 to $500,000, in addition to monthly fees that range from $500 to $3,000 or more depending on services.

The genre is not necessarily science-themed and blurs the line separating science fiction and fantasy into a broad scope of mainstream literature that transcends the mechanical model of science and involves the fantasy of human perception or imagination as realistic components affecting the every day physical world. Quantum fiction is characterized by the use of an element in quantum mechanics as a storytelling device. In quantum fiction, everyday life hinges on some aspect of the quantum nature of reality. The genre reflects the modern human experience of new perceptions about material reality as affected by quantum physics, which transcends mechanical models of science and factors in imagination and human perception as components of reality. This genre is characterized by any or all of the following characteristics: * The author's invocation of quantum mechanics to make possible supernatural, paranormal, or fantastic elements of a story in which reality appears to defy the laws of mechanical physics * A character as a consciously influencing observer of reality * The scientific recognition of an unquantified animating force of matter measured by observer effect (physics), posited as consciousness or spirit * A theme, character, or events of a story existing per an element explainable as reality according to quantum theory * Adventures involving synchronicity, multiple dimension reality, interactive metaverses, parallel worlds or life as a multiverse * Consciousness (a character or a reader) as an interactive influence in the creation and perception of reality and plot line * Reality behaving unpredictably as per subatomic particles Origin of the genre Novelist Vanna Bonta claimed to have coined the term quantum fiction in 1996, when she published her novel Flight: A Quantum Fiction Novel.St. Petersburg Times, April 14, 1996, by Delilah Shapiro Jones; \\"FLIGHT: A Quantum Fiction Novel may be the first work of 'quantum fiction' in recorded history.\\"Flight: quantum fiction and alternate realities, Gaggle of Book Review; January 26, 2008.An Interview with Author Vanna Bonta .

In the story, the protagonist struggles to tell real life from elements in a novel he is writing, as people and events from his novel begin to appear in reality.Flight: a quantum fiction novel Book summary and reviews The first line of Bonta's novel is \\"Which came first—the observer or the particle?\\"\\"Which came first — the observer or the particle?\\" The eternal question. Bonta defined quantum fiction as stories in which consciousness affects physics and determines reality; in her words, \\"the genre is broad and includes life.\\" Bonta further explained her development of this new genre: \\"I don't write science fiction. Science fiction is a niche genre, defined by Ray Bradbury as depiction of the real. 'Quantum fiction' is the realm of all possibilities. The genre is broad, and includes life because fiction is an inextricable part of reality in its various stages, and vice versa.\\"\\"Vanna Bonta Talks About Quantum fiction\\", author Interview by Laurel van der Linde, 2007 (transcript at gather.com , audio at IMDB.com)  New forms of storytelling  Usage of the term quantum fiction began to appear in 21st-century books and academic papers that identified and discussed a new and emerging literary genre that is affected by the new view of the world given by quantum physics. Various artists, academia, and critics explored it independently of one another and in various contexts with the common denominator of a new literary genre. By 2010, hindsight reveals a movement and usage by multiple authors and critics.Damien Walter, Science fiction's five best guides to the present, The Guardian , July 26, 2013  \\"The emerging literary genre of Quantum Fiction tries to shift our scientific understanding into the human realm.\\"Writing in the Age of Quantum Fiction: Science, Technology and “Actualism” in Mutantes Fiction, Professor Christine Henseler, Germán Sierra, Vicente Luis Mora.5 genres of fiction you might not know about, by Emily Babb; October 7, 2012.

Popular novel-length narratives are built basically the same way today as a century ago, and science-fiction writers are in the ironic position of depicting the future using techniques derived entirely from the past.\\" Platt writes, \\"My own modest proposal for revitalizing the novel is a form that I will call, for want of a better term, \\"quantum fiction.\\" Like the quantum theory, it acknowledges the observer (in this case, the reader) as an active participant.\\"Charles Platt, Loose Canon (2001), p. 74. In 2001, Platt states, \\"I believe it should be possible to develop from these prototypes a new genre of \\"quantum fiction\\" with genuinely broad appeal.\\"Charles Platt, Loose Canon (2001), p. 78.  Literary technique  A literary genre, as a category of literary composition, is determined by literary technique, tone, or subject matter (content). Quantum fiction as a genre is primarily defined by technique of writing, and tone and subject matter is not limited. Differences from science fiction Unlike science fiction which is largely defined by content, the subject matter of a quantum fiction can be anything.Quantum Fiction – Entertainment: Light is the new spooky Quantum mechanics; July 16, 2012. Quantum fiction stories are about any subject matter and do not necessarily involve science. The storytelling itself, e.g., treatment of plot (time), characters (observers), location (multiple worlds, parallel selves), is unconventional. Quantum fiction can also hinge on theoretical physics as a subject element of a story.Amy Rogers, Quantum fiction: Reviews of two new physics novels Schrodinger's Gat and Time One , Science Thrillers - September 9, 2013. Quantum fiction deals in possibility and probability. In The Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics, physicist James Kakalios explains how it was the development of quantum mechanics that enabled the wonders enjoyed in the 21st century, not the classical model science-based predictions. As a young science fiction fan in the 1950s and 1960s, Kakalios marveled at the future predicted in science fiction pulp magazines, comics, and films of that era, and he was certain that by 2010 humanity would have flying cars and jet packs. Instead, there are far more fantastic marvels, such as laptop computers, MRI machines, Blu-ray players, and other real-life wonders made manifest via quantum mechanics.James Kakalios, The Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics: A Math-Free Exploration of the Science That Made Our World, Gotham (November 1, 2011); .Damien Walter, \\"Science fiction's five best guides to the present\\", The Guardian, July 26, 2013  \\"SF is not great at foretelling tomorrow's world, but it brings today's into clearer focus than anything else.\\" Using the interpretation of quantum theory that physical reality exists only when it is observed, therefore in the mind, the genre of quantum fiction is more closely related to idealism than the genre of empirical classic science fiction.Karl Jaspers, \\"How quantum mechanics fits in with idealism (aka 'the world is all in your mind')\\", Axial Age End of Belief - April 8, 2013. In this regard, other creative works can be seen as subcategories of quantum fiction and even science, or reality itself, is a work of fiction.Is science merely fiction? Quantum Diaries; Thoughts from particle physicists around the world. Quantum theory as literary device In the fiction of Guyanese novelist and poet Wilson Harris, the author's style, which he defines as quantum fiction, is by way of technique, of narrative structure. In a thesis exploring Harris's literary genre of The Carnival Trilogy as quantum fiction, Rebekka Eklund describes \\"In his ambitiously experimental writing, Harris creates a narrative structure which is multiple and flexible.\\"Rebekka Eklund, \\"Carnival and Quantum theory\\" , Metaphors of identity in Wilson Harris's The Carnival Trilogy, The Society for Caribbean Studies Annual Conference Papers; Vol. 7 (2006). It is Harris's treatment of ordinary characters and events, unrelated to science per se, that defines the genre. In interviews, Harris often describes the effects of quantum perception on the literary process, techniques and devices.Michael Gilkes Interviews Sir Wilson Harris, Kaieteur News, July 18, 2010. Wilson Harris described he has been writing since his first novel what he was to eventually realize as quantum fiction, to give witness to \\"realities hidden from the world you see.\\"Hena Maes-Jelinek, Bénédicte Ledent (eds), Theatre of the Arts - Wilson Harris and the Caribbean; Editions Rodopi B.V.

It is a new concept, like “counter-space” or “theoryphobia” were in their time.\\"Jorge Carrión, \\"The Bicephalous Writer: The Commingling of the Creative Writer and the Critic in a Single Body\\", Storyspaces: Redefining the Critical Enterprise in Twenty-First Century Hispanic Literature. Christine Hensler and Deborah A. Castillo (eds). Hispanic Issues On Line 9 (Spring 2012). In 2009, in a doctoral thesis on the Science of Art, Alexis Blanchet defines the necessity of the quantum fiction genre distinction. \\"Fictional worlds now appear as shifting and undefined as ever to audiences. The notion of quantum fiction aims to provide a framework of production and reception to the contemporary processes of industrialization and diversification of fiction.\\" In quantum fiction, the author perceives and creates characters who experience reality with a surreal or nonlinear view of things that does not correspond with the way the physical senses generally experience life and the world, and that behaves in ways posited by quantum theory. Quantum theory Quantum fiction brings quantum theory forward as the explanation behind the concept of life imitating art and art imitating life via substantiation of literary plot developments, time sequence, character experiences and other literary elements based on quantum mechanics. The term Quantum fiction is etymologically based on the discovery of Max Planck, who first used the word quantum to describe the minute forces at play in the realm of physics. The field was pioneered by quantum physicists Erwin Schrödinger,By Michel Bitbol, Olivier Darrigol, Erwin Schrödinger, Institut autrichien de Paris. Werner Heisenberg,from Werner Heisenberg, \\"Quantum theory has led the physicists far away from the simple materialistic views that prevailed in the natural science of the nineteenth century\\" Physics and Philosophy, New York: Harper & Row Publishers (1962), 128. Wolfgang Pauli,\\"I confess, that very different from you, I do find sometimes scientific inspiration in mysticism … but this is counterbalanced by an immediate sense for mathematics.\\" —W. Pauli. Niels Bohr, and Eugene Wigner, as well as contentions of Louis DeBroglie, Max von Laue and Albert Einstein.pay link to Einstein letter One contention, among others, is that quantum mechanics is a statistical approximation to a deeper reality which behaves predictably via the observer being an inextricable part of reality (Observer effect (physics)). As quantum theories such as Wave–particle duality and the behavior of matter on a subatomic behavior evolves, theories have emerged that life is central to being, reality, and the cosmos. Biocentrism, a theory proposed in 2007 by American scientist Robert Lanza, posits that life creates the universe rather than the other way around.Robert Lanza, MD with Bob Berman, Biocentrism: How Life and Consciousness Are the Keys to Understanding the True Nature of the Universe. Biocentric theory claims to build on quantum physics (although the author isn't a physicist himself), and this view asserts that current theories of the physical world do not work, and can never be made to work, until they fully account for life and consciousness. New findings in particle physics and quantum mechanics are revising previously held views of reality, raising questions about the influence of ideas, human thought and other uncharted causalities in its creation.Welcome to the Quantum Age where Fiction and Fact Intersect Mysterious Universe; September 2, 2010. Examples of quantum reality in fiction In quantum fiction, an author can create characters (the observers) within the work of literature to experience or affect reality (time, place, the material world) via any number of aspects of quantum mechanics, as distinct from classical mechanics. Works of quantum fiction can also introduce reality affected as spooky action at a distance, proved by Alain Aspect, as the course of everyday reality. In quantum fiction, seemingly mundane events can be written as a many-branched tree, wherein every possible quantum outcome is realized in some time line, as posited by the Hugh Everett Many-worlds interpretation. In Bonta's definitive 1995 Flight: a quantum fiction novel, the protagonist is a writer writing a novel within the novel. The character is a metaphor for the observer (any human being living, observing and interacting with reality). The writer begins to notice coincidences between what he is writing (about a girl in a parallel world) and his real life. Further, the protagonist in the novel mentions Bonta, the Flight author, thereby adding yet another parallel reality to the novel's two plot lines. Another quantum element that recurs in the book is via coincidences the characters experience, not by way of the mystical, but as a technique by which Bonta structures synchronicity as a device of quantum entanglement, the behavior of all matter connected on a subatomic level and intersecting by participation of the observers. Bonta's quantum fiction novel posits a quantum animism and the mind as permeating the world at every level. Bonta first depicts some of the novel's characters as otherwise invisible and non-material \\"observers\\" of reality, then quantifies them via their impact on reality through a process of elimination, hence making human consciousness central to the novel as both witness as well as co-creator of reality, a view posited by quantum theory. New art of fiction: quantum vs. linear Novelist Wilson Harris stated he realized what he was writing was quantum fiction, and further described it as giving witness to \\"realities hidden from the world you see.\\" He describes, \\"The quantum concept is that if one fires out an object, it breaks into particles and waves. Conventional novelists go along a linear road, but the quantum split can bring the past into the present in a new art of fiction.\\"Maya Jaggi, \\"A Life in writing\\", The Guardian, December 16, 2006.

In 2003, when interviewed by British-Guyanese poet, novelist and playwright Fred D'Aguiar, Harris describes: \\"'Quantum' brings a hand in fiction that challenges all conventional fixtures of control within the psyche of art.\\" Harris explains that an awareness of the \\"mystery of consciousness\\" as actuated by quantum theory brings different patterns of control in a work of fiction, and he correlates his construction of plot and narrative to a technique he later came to realize as a new technique in literature. \\"The language of conventional, linear fiction, which seems so strong, becomes an illusion and is broken by quantum holes,\\" Harris describes.Fred D'Aguiar, \\"An interview with Wilson Harris\\", BOMB 82 magazine, Winter 2003, Literature. In a dissertation that reviews a Harris trilogy, Rebekka Edlund analyzes his structure as \\"linearity replaced by simultaneous possibilities, or \\"polyhistory,\\" and argues the consequences on literature of a reality as \\"quantum stuff\\" is that linear storytelling becomes obsolete.Rebekka Eklund, \\"Carnival and Quantum theory\\" (2006): \\"The narrative consequence of this malleability, which applies to space as well as time, is that linear storytelling becomes obsolete.\\" Emerging genre In Fiction in the Quantum Universe (June 2002),Susan Strehle, Fiction in the Quantum Universe (Scholarly Book Services, June 27, 2002). Susan Strehle argues that new fiction has developed from the influence of modern physics. This book explores and advances a pluralistic view of the meaning of contemporary fiction as it relates to the quantum-defined view of \\"reality.\\" While quantum fiction novels diverge markedly from a previously held view of reality, Strehle argues that they do so in order to reflect more acutely that aspect of reality which, only the advent of quantum mechanics evidenced as real, or actual; i.e., Reality is no longer \\"realistic.\\" In the new physical or quantum universe, reality is discontinuous, energetic, relative, statistical, subjectively seen, and uncertainly known — all terms taken from new physics. Storytelling technique of quantum fiction, regardless of content, time period or setting, is executed via various literary techniques that pattern a literary work according to quantum behavior as opposed to mechanical physical reality. Devices of the technique include nonlinear plots and timelines unfolding in lives of characters or the narrator, or a characters experience of quantum reality, such as the infinite possibilities of being able to die and live multiple times, and with the creator's awareness, whether intended or not, of the interconnectedness of everything and a fluid behavior of reality that can appear surreal. Life, whether fictional or real, is no longer a world that behaves as old Newtonian physics that perceives atoms as the smallest unit of being. Quantum theory is a radically new view of the universe as fluid and interconnected, influencing the fundamental technique, by which stories are told in a literary genre identified as quantum fiction. It is more the way stories are told and fictional realities behave, not what they are about. Since the inception and coining work of quantum fiction recognized by Publishers Weekly in 1995,\\"Book Review Flight: A Quantum Fiction Novel – Vanna Bonta, Author\\", Publishers Weekly, June 1995. the influence and definition of literature by this as a genre is evidenced in the creation of novels,Frank Roylance, In quantum fiction, things as they are, The Baltimore Sun, August 20, 2000. short fiction,Pranaya Rana, The smoker, quantum fiction, January 26, 2011.Pippa Goldschmidt, Quantum Fiction, July 7, 2013. calls for submissions,Elemental Mirror Call for Quantum Fiction Submissions, August 19, 2010.Intraflux quantum fictionParrell Worlds & Quantum Fiction Book, Library Thing television and film.Barbara Stahura, \\"A Quantum Fable: Fiction and Physics on Film\\", Scienza e Conoscenza Magazine; issue 10; English and Italian.Quantum Genre (QG), Quantum Physics and Quantum Fiction: Likeness and Deviations; Being and Becoming Literary Magazine.Kathleen Beazie, \\"Quantum Fiction: A review of Jean-Philippe Toussaint's 'Running Away'\\", Charlotte Viewpoint, April 24, 2010.The Quantum Physicist’s Revenge, by RJ DentThe New Nature of the Multiverse, A Quantum fiction.

The term quantum fiction began to appear as usage by authors to define a genre work that was not necessarily science-based, and perceived the mundane through understanding of quantum reality. Authors also employ quantum behavior and structure of written works as literary devices, such as non-linear storytelling.Michael Moorcock, \\"The new nature of the multiverse - a quantum fiction\\"Ranse Parker, Quantum Fiction Laurie Brenner biography, Changing Planes; Quantum Fiction.

Chapter Five, \\"Quantum Scripts...,\\" examines the question of what knowledge quantum fiction requires its readers to have, and how fiction helps establish new thought patterns based on scientific concepts.\\" The technique of constructing a quantum plot and narrative first person in the story-telling of Wilson Harris grew from his approach to perception of life and language. Harris states that \\"across the years\\" he then recognized it as native to the fiction he wrote. Harris credits Quantum Reality, the nonfiction book by physicist Nick Herbert, as initially sparking his interest of how quantum theory conceives a world view of \\"simultaneous possibilities.\\" After reading quantum theory, it defined for him how he had instinctively been writing. He stated he realized his method of storytelling, the technique, not content, was quantum fiction. Quantum theory postulates a surreal view of things that does not correspond with the way we generally experience the world, and which is not explained by mechanical laws of the physical world. Unlike science fiction, which the California Department of Education defines as a \\"story based on impact of actual, imagined, or potential science, usually set in the future or on other planets,\\" quantum fiction is a literary technique that relies more on literary fiction than genre writing. It is unlimited to content or subject, and authors craft ordinary characters through sensibilities and perception affected by the quantum view of the world. The term is used by Susan H. Young in her book Quantum Fiction: Relativity and Postmodernism in Lawrence Durrell's The Alexandria Quartet (2000) to retrospectively best categorize the genre of novels by Lawrence Durrell published in 1957—1960.Susan H. Young, Quantum Fiction: Relativity and Postmodernism in Lawrence Durrell's The Alexandria Quartet, City University of New York, 2000. Durrell's tetralogy presents three perspectives on a single set of events and characters in Alexandria, Egypt World War II. Durrell explains the four novels are an exploration of relativity and the notions of continuum and subject–object relation. In a 1959 Paris Review interview, Durrell described the ideas behind the Quartet in terms of a convergence of Eastern and Western metaphysics, based on Einstein's overturning of the old view of the material universe, yielding a new concept of reality.Gene; Mitchell, Julian, \\"Lawrence Durrell: The Art of Fiction No. 23 (interview)\\" (23 April 1959), The Paris Review. Other retrospective categorization includes the vanguard work of Australian author Greg Egan who focused on a model of consciousness and reality in his 1994 novel Permutation City. A science fiction novel, Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand, by Samuel R. Delany is described as quantum fiction in a literary reference volume, not by way of subject matter or futurism, but defined by Delany's technique of \\"reflecting the radical uncertainty of quantum fiction in his world view and fictive discourse.\\"Masterplots II: Nonfiction Series, Volume 4, Frank Northen Magill; Salem Press (1994), , 9780893564780 Discussion about the emerging genre of quantum fiction is the subject of 21st century academic papers and some university courses. In 2006, in a dissertation about quantum mechanics and modern fiction, Samuel Sean Kinch discusses the work of Nicholas Mosley as quantum fiction and cites Susan Strehle's Fiction in the Quantum Universe as an organized analysis of the emerging genre. He writes, \\"To date, Strehle offers the most systematic poetics of quantum fiction.\\"Samuel Sean Kinch, Quantum Mechanics as Critical Model: Reading Nicholas Mosley's Hopeful Monsters, Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction, Taylor & Francis; Spring 2006, Vol. 47, No. 3 291; p. 4. \\"To date, Strehle offers the most systematic poetics of quantum fiction, which she employs to discuss the uses of quantum mechanics in the novels of...\\" In 2007, Samuel Coale began teaching a college course on quantum theory’s influences and effects upon contemporary American fiction.Contemporary American Fiction: Quirks, Quarks and Quests Wheaton College Coale presents his theories in several papers. In Quantum Flux and Narrative Flow: Don DeLillo’s Entanglements with Quantum Theory, Coale presents novels by Don DeLillo and discusses DeLillo's use of quantum theory and how it is revealed in the structure and style of his novels. Other topics include similarities between quantum theory and postmodernism, the themes of perception and time and space in DeLillo's work, and religious interpretation.Samuel Coale, Quantum Flux and Narrative Flow: Don DeLillo’s Entanglements with Quantum Theory, in Language and Literature, August 2011. In the essay \\"Psychic Visions and Quantum Physics: Oates’ Big Bang and The Limits of Language,\\" Coale analyzes the literary style of novelist Joyce Carol Oates. According to the Coale, the characters of Oates are indicating that the individual self recognizes the strange and unfathomable otherness at the mysterious center of self-hood. Alexis Blanchet's 2009 dissertation and doctoral thesis mentions quantum fiction, and argues the new genre quantum fiction is a necessary framework genre for relationships between fiction, cinema, and video game involving life and interactive participation as overlapping of realities.Alexis Blanchet, Les synergies entre cinéma et jeu vidéo: histoire, économie et théorie de l'adaptation vidéoludique; Thèse soutenue - Thèse de doctorat en Sciences de l'art (Doctoral thesis on Science of Art), October 30, 2009. In a 2007 interview about quantum fiction, Vanna Bonta states: \\"As people become more aware of this universe as a quantum universe, it will embrace things like holographic entertainment experiences. Already, virtual reality and virtual interaction are an element of quantum fiction.\\" In 2013, Scientific American launched a quantum fiction short fiction competition headed up by Mariette DiChristina in cooperation with the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore. Elements of quantum reality were broken down into simplified concepts that could be woven into fiction. Science fiction publishers and editors joined the specialized literary event.Scientific American launches fiction competition; July 16, 2013. As \\"actualism\\" Susan Strehle explores how the changed physical world appears in both content and form in recent fiction, calling it \\"actualism\\" after the observations of Werner Heisenberg.Susan Strehle, Fiction in the Quantum Universe, Scholarly Book Service, (June 27, 2002). It is characterized by incompletions, indeterminacy, or \\"open\\" endings that involve the reader or some undetermined element to continue or resolve the work. Within that framework, Gravity's Rainbow is cited as an example as it ends not with a period but with a dash. Strehle sets forth that although important recent narratives diverge markedly from realistic practice, they do so in order to reflect more acutely on what we now understand as real. Within this framework, Strehle's book also presents a critical analysis of major novels by Thomas Pynchon, Robert Coover, William Gaddis, John Barth, Margaret Atwood, and Donald Barthelme. Strehle argues that such innovations in narrative reflect on 20th-century history, politics, science, and discourse. The perception of a changed reality reaches into philosophy, psychology, literary theory, and other areas. The final chapter extends the discussion beyond North American borders to African, South American, and European texts, suggesting a global community of writers whose fiction belongs in the quantum universe.\\"Fiction in the Quantum Universe, by Susan Strehle\\", aLibris.

Based in New Orleans, Louisiana, as of the 2019 parade, the Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus has over 2500 dues-paying members who call themselves \\"ChewbacchanALIENs\\" or \\"Chewbs.\\" It describes its mission as \\"to save the galaxy by bringing the magical revelry of Mardi Gras to the poor, disenfranchised, socially awkward and generally weird masses who may have never had the opportunity to participate in a Mardi Gras Parade Organization,\\" and aims to \\"elevate all aspects of Fandom and celebrate Carnival in our own unique way.\\" In short, \\"saving the galaxy, one drunken nerd at a time!\\"  History  The group was founded by Ryan S Ballard and Kirah Haubrich in the fall of 2010 when the two were at The Saturn Bar. They were soon joined by local attorney Brett Powers, and together they comprise the original three \\"Overlords\\" of the Krewe. Chewbacchus marched for the first time during Mardi Gras 2011 near the Uptown parade route on \\"Bacchus\\" Sunday as a satiric mashup of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, and Chewbacca, the Wookiee from Star Wars.  Parade themes and royalty  Mardi Gras krewes select a new theme for their parades each year and a new king and/or queen to reign over them. Chewbacchus often selects people from the entertainment industry and creates playful titles for its royalty, as listed below. * 2011 Theme: BacchnALIEN Invasion. Queen Cynthia Scott (actress from the movie Aliens) and Emperor for Life Peter Mayhew (actor who played the character of Chewbacca in Star Wars). Because Peter Mayhew could not attend, the krewe nominated Lil Doogie (a locally notorious foul-mouthed comedic puppet rapper) as the \\"Ad Hoc Puppet Government\\". * 2012 Theme: Chewbaccalypse. King Giorgio Tsoukalos (consulting producer of the History Channel's Ancient Aliens series) was crowned \\"Lord of the Chewbaccalypse\\". * 2013 Theme: Return of the Wookiee. King Peter Mayhew, also Emperor for Life, finally rode with the krewe in a \\"Cosmic Triumph\\" for Chewbacchus. His wife, Angie, served as Royal Consort. They rode in an oversized Wookiee Throne on top of a spectacularly detailed Millennium Falcon contraption. * 2014 Theme: Wrath of Khan-ival. King Chester Simmons was selected randomly from among the Chewbacchus parade escorts, hard-working volunteers who help clear the path for the parade and provide assistance to participants. In order to select its King or Queen, at the volunteer orientation immediately before the parade, the krewe provided volunteers with king cake and replaced the traditional baby in the cake with a Wookiee. King Chester Simmons happened to get the slice with the Wookiee. * 2015 Theme: Cult of the Sacred Drunken Wookiee. King/\\"Pope\\" Andy Richter (sidekick from Conan O'Brien's late-night show), Emperor for Life Peter Mayhew, and Queen/Royal Consort Angie Mayhew. * 2016 Theme: Chewluminati: Nerd World Order. Supreme Lizard King of the Chewluminati Keith Green, who won a contest called Mystery of the Chewluminati, a conceptual scavenger hunt. * 2017 Theme: The Revel Alliance. The Krewe welcomed Ross Marquand (best known for playing Aaron on AMC's hit series The Walking Dead) as the King of the Revel Alliance. * 2018 Theme: Get On Board the Mothership. The Krewe honored their outgoing original Overlords as royalty: Ryan Ballard, Brett Powers, and Kirah Haubrich. * 2019 Theme: Space Farce. Brian O'Halloran ruled as King Brian the First, Commander of the Space Farce, He Who Is Not Supposed to Be Here Today. *2020 Theme: The Roar of the Wookiee. Royalty were chosen in a Willy Wonka-meets-X Files competition in which fortunate spectators from the 2019 parade were given special \\"pocket shrines\\" with instructions for the first step of the contest. Forty-two (42) of these shrines were handed out, in honor of the Krewe's sacred number.  Floats and throws  Mardi Gras krewes often ride on trailers, vehicles, or floats, but Chewbacchus is a walking krewe, with a \\"contraptions\\" only policy. Contraptions are pushed (human-powered) rather than pulled by truck or tractor, and they do not have riders. This provides a safer experience for members and also allows contraptions to roll down narrower streets. All of the Krewe's parade contraptions make an effort to be environmentally friendly, made with recycled materials. These contraptions are pushed, pedaled, or pulled on frames of bicycles, homemade trailers, and shopping carts. Though throws--\\"Mardi Gras\\" beads are probably the best known traditional throw--usually produce much plastic waste, Chewbacchus actively discourages packaging and requires all members to dispose of their trash responsibly on parade night. Chewbacchus is also known for their unique, handmade throws created by individual members. These highly prized items are sought by parade attendees and can feature the mother krewe's annual theme, a subkrewe annual theme, or a subkrewe in general.  Issues and parades  The Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus is remarkable for its rapid pace of growth and popularity among local New Orleanians, gaining momentum from a small core group in its first few weeks to over 300 dues-paying members in its first year. Membership grew to 400 members in 2012. Over 500 dues-paying members marched in the 2013 parade and estimates place audience attendance at approximately 20,000 people. By 2016, membership reached over 1200 ChewbacchanALIENs, and in 2018, they had over 2600 dues-paying members. One of the reasons for the rapid growth of Chewbacchus is the open nature of the parade—anyone can join for a relatively small fee, as compared to other krewes that can be invitation-only. Chewbacchus is known as of the \\"downtown\\" or \\"downriver\\" parades, named because its route is down the river from the \\"Uptown\\" St. Charles Avenue route. Downtown/Downriver parades began in the first decade of the 21st century, and they generally are open to a wider membership than traditional krewes. Their membership is fairly young, on average, and their parades are satirical, featuring parody and pastiche.  Hoaxes  The Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus is responsible for some notable hoaxes and publicity stunts and has been praised for its clever pranks. It kicked off its 2012 season with a guerrilla marketing campaign centered on an elaborate Bigfoot hoax by a fake organization, the New Orleans Bigfoot Society (N.O.B.S.), that claimed that Sasquatch lurked in New Orleans City Park. After generating controversy among both the media and the Bigfoot research community, the creature was eventually revealed to be a \\"Drunken Wookiee\\". During the summer of 2012 the Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus expanded its fan base beyond Science Fiction to include Fantasy and Horror and announced it with a publicity stunt by organizing a fake protest by the \\"Mystik Krewe of P.U.E.W.C. (People for the inclusion of Unicorns, Elves, and Winebots in Chewbacchus)\\" at its second annual Alien Beach Party at Tipitina's. In late November 2012, the krewe was responsible for a prank website that quickly drew the ire of NASA by announcing that the Curiosity rover had located Mardi Gras beads on Mars and that the famous Martian \\"face\\" was in fact a Wookiee temple. As a gesture of goodwill the Overlords of Chewbacchus offered the entire Mars Rover team free memberships in the Krewe.  Date Changes & Future Dates  Chewbacchus originally rolled on Bacchus Sunday, the Sunday immediately before Fat Tuesday, on Bacchus's Uptown route. In 2013, the krewe changed their route to the Marigny/Bywater neighborhood and rolled on the 2nd Saturday before Mardi Gras. In 2019, due to increased size, the City of New Orleans asked the krewe to choose an earlier date to have full access to law enforcement and other resources. To avoid competition with Krewe du Vieux, the Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus moved to the 4th Saturday before Mardi Gras, solidly outside of city-designated Carnivale season. This change made them the first large parade during the month before Mardi Gras Day.https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/entertainment_life/article_f9460804-2675-11e9-b417-474c40413eed.html *Parade 2021: Saturday, January 23 *Parade 2022: Saturday, February 5  References External links * Mardi Gras in New Orleans ","title":"Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus"},{"id":"36085188","text":"Chris McGarry (born August 19, 1966) is an American actor born in Roselle, New Jersey, known for his performance in the American television series Law & Order on NBC from 2001–2005.

Early life Kanhaiyalal was born in 1910 in Varanasi. His father Pandit Bhairodutt Choube, popularly known as Choubeji, was the proprietor of the Sanatan Dharm Natak Samaj in Varanasi. With his father not in agreement with him taking up any form of stage work, he eventually wore out his father's opposition and did odd jobs in the troupe. At 16, he started writing and then moved on to small roles. When his father died, the brothers tried for some time to run the drama company. Proving to be unsuccessful, they downed shutters and Kanhaiyalal decided to seek a film career in Bombay. His elder brother Sankata Prasad Chaturvedi had already set a precedent and established himself as an actor in silent films, but Kanhaiyalal came to films without the intention of acting, wanting to write and direct instead. Eventually capitulating, he began by working as an extra in Sagar Movietone's Sagar Ka Sher. He would have remained a background extra but for a fated twist. Career He was fond of plays and came to Mumbai to find a space on stage. He staged his own written play Pandrah August in Mumbai, and later he tried his luck in films. He also had written many plays. In the 1939 film Ek Hi Raasta as Banke, he got a break in Hindi films and in 1940 he got the role of the moneylender (Sahukar) in Mehboob Khan's film Aurat as Sukkhi Lala. After that, he later acted in many films as a character artiste. When Mehboob Khan directed his film Mother India which was a remake of his earlier film 'Aurat', he again picked Kanhaiyalal to act as Sukkhi Lala, a character that came alive with his natural acting. Some of the performances of Kanhaiyalal which were appreciated by the audience for his versatility include his characters in the films Bhookh (1947), Ganga Jamuna, Gopi, Upkar, Apna Desh, Janta Hawaldar, Dushman, Bandhan, Bharosa, Dharti Kahe Pukar Ke, Hum Paanch, Upkar, Gaon Hamara Desh Tumhara, Dadi Maa, Gruhasti, Hatyara, Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Heera, Teen Bahuraniyan, Dost etc. His memorable roles include those as villainous scheming moneylenders in the films Mother India , Ganga Jamuna, Gopi and Upkaar. As he recalled in an interview, \\"An actor playing Motilal's father had not reported on the sets, so there was an opportunity to step into the breach. The dialogue I had to speak ran to a full sheet of foolscap paper. Almost everyone on the sets was ready to laugh at me trying to be an actor, but God helped me and I did my job.\\" The film was Jhul Badn, written by K. M. Munshi (the founder of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan), directed by Sarvottam Badami and starring Motilal and Sabita Devi. To his delight, his talkie debut fetched him a ten rupee increment as his salary rose to Rs 45 a month. \\"Another promotion I earned was to play grandfather instead of father. This was in Sadhana (Old), also by Sagar Movietone. My grandson Prem Adib was the hero of the film. That was my first big role after which I became 'acceptable'. I was quite young but I thus started playing old roles. And, down the years, I got older and older but my roles didn't grow younger and younger!\\" For Sadhana, he also wrote the dialogues and lyrics. In fact, it was while he was reading out the dialogues he had written that Chimanlal Desai, proprietor of Sagar, made him an offer to enact the role. \\"I must also put it on record that when the film was being made, quite a number of people thought I was bogus and withheld cooperation. However, the film was a big hit and achieved silver jubilee at Imperial Cinema.\\" Getting frustrated at not getting the chance to direct a film, however, after Sadhana, Kanhaiyalal went home to Varanasi. When he returned to Bombay, it was with the understanding that he would help Virendra Desai (son of Sagar Movietone boss, Chimanlal Desai). He rewrote the dialogue of Sanskar and also its lyrics, but it came to naught. However, the rise of his career graph was launched by Mehboob Khan with writer Wajahat Mirza playing catalyst. At his instance Kanhaiyalal was selected for the role of Sukkhi Lala in Aurat (1940). He played the wicked moneylender who has evil designs on the young widow. As he reminisced in an interview, \\"On this production, too, I had the feeling that the ice had yet to be broken. There was no make-up man free or willing to attend to me. When I explained this difficulty to Faredoon Irani, the cinematographer, he calmly said, 'Don't worry. Just appear as you are and I will photograph you without makeup.' He did just that. My make-up consisted only of a moustache. There are not very many cinematographers who will stake their reputation by agreeing to photograph artistes without make-up. I admired Mr. Irani's courage and self- confidence. I regard my Aurat role as a really good one. I was helped tremendously by the lines Wajahat Mirza wrote for me. In fact, I firmly believe that what an actor needs most of all are good dialogue to enable him to do well.\\" During the shooting of the scene in which the house collapses on the salacious Sukhilala, Kanhaiyalal got hurt. In honour of the dictum, the show must go on, he right away told Mehboob Khan not to call a doctor immediately, but to finish the remaining shots. When he came out of the set eventually, the doctor was waiting for him. Aurat had a golden jubilee run with Sardar Akhtar (Mrs. Mehboob Khan) playing the lead. When Mehboob remade Aurat as Mother India (1957), only Kanhaiyalal reprised his role, a first in Hindi cinema with the same actor replaying the same character 17 years later. Telescoped into the stereotype that bears his signature, early in his career he experimented much more than in his later years. \\"In Mehboob's film Bahen (1941), I had the role of a good-natured pickpocket. Here, four scenes originally conceived for me were spun out into about fourteen by Wajahat Mirza. In National Studios' Radhika (1941), directed by K. B. Lall, I played a temple priest and in Lal Haveli (1944, again by Lall), I played the comic role of a Pandit. Yakub starred in the film and his frequent punch line telling me Chacha, pasina aa raha hai became quite famous.\\" In Gunga Jumna (1961), he again excelled as a munim. He also shone in Mahesh Kaul's Sautela Bhai (1962), but the film tanked. Gemini's Grahasti (1962), in which he played a station master gave him immense satisfaction and he said: \\"In my opinion, it's the first picture from the South starring me to achieve that much versatility.\\" The trouble monger continued his winning streak with Upkar, Ram aur Shyam (both 1967), Teen Bahuraniyan, Dharti Kahe Pukare (1969), Gopi, Jeevan Mrityu (1970), Dushman (1972) Apna Desh (1972), Heera, Dost, Palkon Ki Chaon Mein, Karmayogi (1978), Janata Hawaldar (1979) and Hum Paanch (1980). After completing a century of roles in Bollywood, Hathkadi (1982) became his swan song as his histrionics breathed their last on 14 Aug 1982 while he was 72. Death He died on 14 August 1982 at the age of 72.

The aircraft, piloted by See, crashed into the McDonnell Aircraft building where their Gemini 9 spacecraft was being assembled. The weather was poor with rain, snow, fog, and low clouds. A NASA panel, headed by the Chief of the Astronaut Office, Alan Shepard, investigated the crash. While the panel considered possible medical issues or aircraft maintenance problems, in addition to the weather and air traffic control factors, the end verdict was that the crash was caused by pilot error. In the aftermath of the crash, the backup crew of Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan were moved up to the primary position for the Gemini 9 mission, scheduled for early June. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the mission's backup crew, and through the normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without the Gemini experience, it is unlikely that Aldrin would have been assigned to the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon. Accident See and Bassett were the prime crew assigned to the Gemini 9 mission. They and the backup crew for the mission, Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan, were flying to St. Louis from their normal training base in Houston, Texas, for two weeks of simulator training for rendezvous and docking procedures at McDonnell Aircraft, the prime contractor for the Gemini spacecraft. It was a routine flight that they had made many times previously. See and Bassett flew in one Northrop T-38A Talon jet trainer, tail number NASA 901 (Air Force serial number 63-8181), with See at the controls and Bassett in the rear seat. A second T-38, NASA 907, carried Stafford and Cernan in the same configuration. The two aircraft took off from Ellington Air Force Base in Texas at 7:35 a.m. CST, with See in the lead and Stafford in wing position. Weather at Lambert Field in St. Louis was poor, with rain, snow, and fog, broken clouds at and a cloud ceiling of , requiring an instrument approach. When the two aircraft emerged below the clouds shortly before 9 am, both pilots realized that they had missed the outer marker and overshot the runway. See then elected to perform a visual circling approach, a simplified landing procedure allowing flight under instrument rules, as long as the pilot can keep the airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight. The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing. See completed a full circle to the left at an altitude of , and announced his intention to land on the southwest runway (24). With landing gear down and full flaps, the plane dropped quickly but too far left of the runway. See turned on his afterburner to increase power while pulling up and turning hard right. Seconds later, at 8:58 a.m. CST, the plane struck the roof of McDonnell Building 101 on the northeast side of the airport. It lost its right wing and landing gear on impact, then cartwheeled and crashed in a parking lot beyond the building which was in use as a construction staging area. Both astronauts died instantly from trauma sustained in the crash. See was thrown clear of the cockpit and was found in the parking lot still strapped to his ejection seat with the parachute partially open. Bassett was decapitated on impact; his severed head was found later in the day in the rafters of the damaged assembly building. Inside Building 101, 17 McDonnell employees and contractors received mostly minor injuries from falling debris. The crash set off several small fires inside the building, and caused minor flooding from broken pipes and sprinklers. See and Bassett died within of the spacecraft that they were to have flown in orbit, which was in the final stages of assembly in another part of Building 101. Spacecraft S/C9 was undamaged, but a piece of debris from the T-38's wing struck the unfinished S/C10 spacecraft. Stafford and Cernan, still circling in the clouds in the second T-38, had no idea what had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and no one on the ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day. Investigation and aftermath NASA immediately appointed a seven-member panel to investigate the crash, headed by their Chief of the Astronaut Office, Alan Shepard. While the panel weighed possible medical issues, aircraft maintenance problems, weather conditions, and air traffic control factors, their end verdict was pilot error, citing See's inability \\"to maintain visual reference for a landing\\" as the primary cause of the crash. See was described as a \\"cautious and conservative\\" pilot in the accident report. In his memoir, chief astronaut Deke Slayton was less diplomatic, calling See's piloting skills \\"old- womanish.\\" Others, including Neil Armstrong, who had worked with See on the backup crew for Gemini 5, have since defended See's piloting ability. Since the crash did not affect space flight operations and the spacecraft itself was undamaged—it was shipped to NASA two days after the crash—the accident caused neither delays nor engineering changes in the U.S. space program. However, the loss of the Gemini 9 crew did cause NASA to reshuffle the crew assignments for subsequent Gemini and Apollo missions; Stafford and Cernan were moved up to the primary position for Gemini 9, re-designated Gemini 9A. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the back- up crew for Gemini 9A, and through the normal rotation were then assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without experience during the Gemini mission, Buzz Aldrin would have been an unlikely choice for the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.

It was written during his transport from Antioch to his execution in Rome. To the Romans contains Ignatius’ most detailed explanation of his views on martyrdom. Composition To the Romans is one of seven epistles attributed to Ignatius that are generally accepted as authentic. In 5th century, this collection was enlarged by spurious letters.\\"Spurious Epistles of St. Ignatius of Antioch\\" at NewAdvent.org It is clear that To the Romans was written soon before the martyrdom of Ignatius, but it is uncertain when precisely this martyrdom occurred. Tradition places the martyrdom of Ignatius in the reign of Trajan, who was emperor of Rome from 98 to 117 AD. While many scholars accept the traditional dating of Ignatius' martyrdom under Trajan, others have argued for a somewhat later date. Richard Pervo dated Ignatius' death to 135-140 AD, and British classicist Timothy Barnes has argued for a date some time in the 140s AD. Interestingly, although we do not know which specific year Ignatius wrote this letter, he does provide the month and day: August 23 (Ign. Rom. 10). Background Following his arrest in Syria, Ignatius traveled through many cities on his way to Rome for execution. To the Romans was written prior to his arrival in Rome, while he was in Smyrna. Our evidence for the Ignatius’ journey to Rome primarily comes from the fourth-century church historian Eusebius of Caesarea.Wilhelm Pratscher (ed.) The Apostolic Fathers: An Introduction p.91 While the other Ignatian epistles are addressed to communities with whom Ignatius had already had contact (either in person or via representatives), To the Romans addresses Roman Christians prior to his arrival in Rome. The epistle may have been intended to allow Roman Christians to prepare for Ignatius’ arrival, especially because it includes the specific day and month it was written. Content The epistle follows this basic epistolary format: * Greeting to the church in Rome (preface) * Request that the Christians in Rome not intervene to stop his martyrdom (1.1-3.3) * Explanation of his suffering as union with Christ (4.1-8.1) * Closing and farewell (8.2-10.3) Clayton Jefford provides the following short summary of the epistle: :\\"Greetings to the Romans! Though I am unworthy, I long to see you. Pray for me. And when I arrive in chains, let me die a martyr’s death – eaten by wild beasts! I long for this proof that I am a true disciple of Christ. Let me follow in the footsteps of the Lord. I no longer take pleasure in life. Pray for the church in Syria.\\" Significance While To the Romans is primarily significant for Ignatius’ discussion of his impending martyrdom, it is also important for serving as a representation of early Christian writing, though it does differ from the other six letters Ignatius wrote. Ignatius implores the Roman Christians to allow him to be martyred, that they practice what they teach in regard to enduring suffering. The language Ignatius uses to discuss his death is frequently eucharistic, often referring to the consumption of his body as bread. Likewise, the language Ignatius uses is morbid, as the prospect of his death informs much of the letter. He claims that only through death can he attain true freedom, and that there is no longer any value in worldly things for him. Ignatius also likens his movement towards Rome to a victory march from battle. The various metaphors Ignatius uses glorify martyrdom. Overall, his rumination on martyrdom reflects the countercultural attitudes of Christianity during this post-apostolic era. Also, it is important in how it differs from Ignatius’ other six epistles. This letter discusses martyrdom with a people Ignatius has not yet personally encountered (the Christian community in Rome), whereas the other letters primarily address issues such as church hierarchy, creeds and confessions, and maintaining Christianity. Thus, this letter places importance upon Rome as a vehicle towards martyrdom. Finally, this text is also important because it provides a sketch of the emerging church hierarchy. We can see how the three- tiered church hierarchy (consisting of bishops, elders, and deacons) was coming into being, and how regional churches were gaining unity through it.

As many as several hundred farmed the Harlem flatlands. The first European settlement in the area was by siblings Hendrick (Henry), Isaac and Rachel de Forest, Franco-Dutch immigrants in 1637. In 1639 Jochem Pietersen Kuyter established the homestead named Zegendaal, or Blessed Valley, stretched along the Harlem River from about the present 127th Street to 140th Street. Early European settlers were forced to flee to New Amsterdam in lower Manhattan whenever hostilities with the natives heated up, and the native population gradually decreased amidst conflict with the Dutch. The settlement was named Nieuw Haarlem (New Haarlem), after the Dutch city of Haarlem, and was formally incorporated in 1660 under the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant.\\"To Live In Harlem\\", Frank Hercules, National Geographic, February 1977, p. 178+ The Indian trail to Harlem's lush bottomland meadows was rebuilt by black slaves of the Dutch West India Company,Introduction to Harlem USA, John Henrik Clarke, 1970. and eventually developed into the Boston Post Road. In 1664, the English took control of the New Netherland colony, and English colonial Governor Richard Nicolls established the \\"Harlem Line\\" as the southern border patent line of the village of Nieuw Haarlem (later, the village of Harlem) running approximately northward between near modern East 74th Street, at the East River, and West 129th Street, on the Hudson River. The British also tried to change the name of the community to \\"Lancaster\\", but the name never stuck, and eventually settled down to the Anglicized Harlem. The Dutch took control of the area again for one year in 1673. The village grew very slowly until the middle 18th century, and it became a resort of sorts for the rich of New York City. Only the Morris-Jumel Mansion survives from this period. Harlem played an important role in the American Revolution. The British had established their base of operations in lower Manhattan, and George Washington fortified the area around Harlem to oppose them. From Harlem, he could control the land routes to the north, as well as traffic on the Harlem River. The New York Provincial Congress met in White Plains, as did the convention drafting the constitution for New York State. On September 16, 1776, the Battle of Harlem Heights, sometimes referred to as the Battle of Harlem or Battle of Harlem Plain, was fought in western Harlem around the Hollow Way (now West 125th Street), with conflicts on Morningside Heights to the south and Harlem Heights to the north. The American troops were outnumbered, 5000 to 2000, and were ill-equipped compared to their opponents, but outflanked the British and forced them to retreat to the area around what is now West 106th Street. It was Washington's first American victory. Later that year, the British would avenge this defeat by chasing Washington and his troops north, then turning back and burning Harlem to the ground. In 1765, Harlem was a small agricultural town not far from New York City. Rebuilding took decades, and infrastructure was improved much more slowly than was happening in New York City proper. The village remained largely rural through the early 19th century and, though the \\"grid system\\" of streets, designed downtown, was formally extended to Harlem in 1811, it does not seem that anybody expected it would mean much. The 1811 report that accompanied the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 noted that it was \\"improbable that (for centuries to come) the grounds north of the Harlem Flat will be covered with houses.\\" Though undeveloped, the area was not poor. Harlem was \\"a synonym for elegant living through a good part of the nineteenth century.\\"\\"Harlem, the Village That Became a Ghetto\\", Martin Duberman, in New York, N.Y.: An American Heritage History of the Nation's Greatest City, 1968 The village remained largely farmland estates, such as [Conrad] Van Keulen's Hook, orig. Otterspoor, bordered north of the Mill Creek (now 108th St., orig. Montagne Creek at 109th St.), which flowed into Harlem Lake, to the farm of Morris Randall, northwest on the Harlem River, and westward to the Peter Benson, or Mill Farm.Riker, James.

Also, Sketches of Numerous Families, and the Recovered Histories of Land – Titles. New York: J. Riker, 1881, pp. 588–91. This former bowery [of land] was subdivided into twenty-two equal plots, of about 6 to each, of which portions later owned by Abraham Storm, including thirty-one acres (east of Fifth Avenue between 110th & 125th St.) were sold by Storm's widow Catherine in 1795 to James Roosevelt (great grandfather of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1760–1847). This branch of the Roosevelt family subsequently moved to the town of Hyde Park, but several of Roosevelt's children remain interred in Harlem.Hoffman, Eugene Augustus. Genealogy of the Hoffman Family: Descendants of Martin Hoffman, with Biographical Notes. New York: Dodd and Mead, 1899, pp. 262–64. As late as 1820, the community had dwindled to 91 families, a church, a school, and a library. Wealthy farmers, known as \\"patroons\\", maintained these country estates largely on the heights overlooking the Hudson River. Service connecting the outlays of Harlem with the rest of the City of New York (on the southern tip of the island of Manhattan) was done via steamboat on the East River, an hour-and-a-half passage, sometimes interrupted when the river froze in winter, or else by stagecoach along the Boston Post Road, which descended from McGown's Pass (now in Central Park) and skirted the salt marshes around 110th Street, to pass through Harlem. The New York and Harlem Railroad (now Metro North) was incorporated in 1831 to better link the city with Harlem and Westchester County, starting at a depot at East 23rd Street, and extending north to a railroad junction in Columbia County at Chatham, New York by 1851. Charles Henry Hall, a wealthy lawyer and land speculator, recognized the changes that this railroad would make possible in Harlem and began a successful program of infrastructure development, building out streets, gas lines, sewer lines, and other facilities needed for urban life. Piers were also built, enabling Harlem to become an industrial suburb serving New York City. The rapid development of infrastructure enabled some to become wealthy, and the area became important to politicians, many of whom lived in Harlem. New York mayors Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence and Daniel Tiemann both lived in Harlem in this period. For many in New York City, Harlem was at this time regarded as a sort of country retreat. The village had a population of poorer residents as well, including blacks, who came north to work in factories or to take advantage of relatively low rents. Between 1850 and 1870, many large estates, including Hamilton Grange, the estate of Alexander Hamilton, were auctioned off as the fertile soil was depleted and crop yields fell. Some of the land became occupied by Irish squatters, whose presence further depressed property values. 125th Street station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. 1866–1920 During the American Civil War, Harlem saw draft riots, along with the rest of the city, but the neighborhood was a significant beneficiary of the economic boom that followed the end of the war, starting in 1868. The neighborhood continued to serve as a refuge for New Yorkers, but increasingly those coming north were poor and Jewish or Italian. Factories, homes, churches, and retail buildings were built at great speed. The Panic of 1873 caused Harlem property values to drop 80%, and gave the City of New York the opportunity to annex the troubled community as far north as 155th Street. Recovery came soon, and row houses (as distinct from the previous generation's free-standing houses) were being constructed in large numbers by 1876. Development accelerated in part in anticipation of elevated railroads, which were extended to Harlem in 1880. With the construction of the \\"els\\", urbanized development occurred very rapidly. Developers anticipated that the planned Lexington Avenue subway would ease transportation to lower Manhattan. Fearing that new housing regulations would be enacted in 1901, they rushed to complete as many new buildings as possible before these came into force.\\"The Growth and Decline of Harlem's Housing\\", Thorin Tritter, Afro-Americans in New York Life and History, January 31, 1998 Early entrepreneurs had grandiose schemes for Harlem: Polo was played at the original Polo Grounds, later to become home of the New York Giants baseball team. Oscar Hammerstein I opened the Harlem Opera House on East 125th Street in 1889. By 1893, even row houses did not suffice to meet the growing population, and large-scale apartment buildings were the norm. In that year, Harlem Monthly Magazine wrote that \\"it is evident to the most superficial observer that the centre of fashion, wealth, culture, and intelligence, must, in the near future, be found in the ancient and honorable village of Harlem.\\" However, also in that year, the construction glut and a delay in the building of the subway led to a fall in real estate prices which attracted immigrant Eastern Europe Jews and Italians to Harlem in accelerating numbers. There had been a Jewish community of 12 in Harlem in 1869 that grew to a peak of almost 200,000 in about 1915. Presaging their resistance to the arrival of blacks, existing landowners tried to stop Jews from moving into the neighborhood. At least one rental sign declared \\"Keine Juden und Keine Hunde\\" (No Jews and no dogs).Bruce Perry, Station Hill, Malcolm, 1991, p. 154-55. Italians began to arrive in Harlem only a few years after the Jews did. By 1900 there were 150,000 Italians in Harlem. Both groups moved particularly into East Harlem. The Jewish population of Harlem embraced the City College of New York, which moved to Harlem in 1907. In the years after the move, 90% of the school's students were Jewish, and many of the school's most distinguished graduates date from this period. Both the Jewish Mob and Italian Mafia emerged in East Harlem and soon expanded their operations to the entire neighborhood. West 116th Street between Lenox and 8th Avenue became a vice district. The neighborhood also became a major center for more conventional entertainment, with 125th Street as a particular center for musical theater, vaudeville, and moving pictures. The Jewish presence in Harlem was ephemeral, and by 1930, only 5,000 Jews remained. As they left, their apartments in East Harlem were increasingly filled by Puerto Ricans, who were arriving in large numbers by 1913. Italian Harlem lasted longer, and traces of the community lasted into the 1980s and to the present in the area around Pleasant Avenue. Black population increase These buildings on West 135 Street were among the first in Harlem to be occupied entirely by blacks; in 1921, #135 became home to Young's Book Exchange, the first \\"Afrocentric\\" bookstore in Harlem. Marcus Garvey in 1925 Black residents have been present in Harlem continually since the 1630s, and as the neighborhood modernized in the late 19th century, they could be found especially in the area around 125th Street and in the \\"Negro tenements\\" on West 130th Street. By 1900, tens of thousands lived in Harlem. The mass migration of blacks into the area began in 1904, due to another real estate crash, the worsening of conditions for blacks elsewhere in the city, and the leadership of black real estate entrepreneurs including Phillip Payton, Jr. After the collapse of the 1890s, new speculation and construction started up again in 1903 and the resulting glut of housing led to a crash in values in 1904 and 1905 that eclipsed the late-19th century slowdown. Landlords could not find white renters for their properties, so Philip Payton stepped in to bring blacks. His company, the Afro-American Realty Company, has been credited with the migration of blacks from their previous neighborhoods,\\"The Making of Harlem,\\" James Weldon Johnson, The Survey Graphic, March 1925 the Tenderloin, San Juan Hill (now the site of Lincoln Center), Minetta Lane in Greenwich Village and Hell's Kitchen in the west 40s and 50s.\\"Negro Districts in Manhattan\\", The New York Times, November 17, 1901.\\"Negroes Move Into Harlem\\", New York Herald, December 24, 1905.

In addition, a number of tenements that had been occupied by blacks in the west 30s were destroyed at this time to make way for the construction of the original Penn Station. In 1907, black churches began to move uptown. Several congregations built grand new church buildings, including St Philip's on West 134th Street just west of Seventh Avenue (the wealthiest church in Harlem), the Abyssinian Baptist Church on West 138th Street and St Mark's Methodist Church on Edgecombe Avenue. More often churches purchased buildings from white congregations of Christians and Jews whose members had left the neighborhood, including Metropolitan Baptist Church on West 128th and Seventh Avenue, St James Presbyterian Church on West 141st Street, and Mt Olivet Baptist Church on Lenox Avenue.\\"Africa-Conscious Harlem\\", Richard B.

During World War I, expanding industries recruited black laborers to fill new jobs, thinly staffed after the draft began to take young men. So many blacks came that it \\"threaten[ed] the very existence of some of the leading industries of Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Alabama.\\"\\"118,000 Negroes Move From The South\\", The New York World, November 5, 1917 Many settled in Harlem. In 1910, Central Harlem was about 10% black. By 1920, central Harlem was 32.43% black. The 1930 census showed 70.18% of Central Harlem's residents as blackGotham Gazette, 2008 and lived as far south as Central Park, at 110th Street. The expansion was fueled primarily by an influx of blacks from the southern U.S. states, especially Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, who took trains up the East Coast. There were also numerous immigrants from the West Indies. As blacks moved in, white residents left. Between 1920 and 1930, 118,792 white people left the neighborhood and 87,417 blacks arrived. Between 1907 and 1915,\\"Harlem, the Making of a Ghetto\\", Gilbert Osofsky, in Harlem U.S.A., 1971 ed. p.13 some white residents of Harlem resisted the neighborhood's change, especially once the swelling black population pressed west of Lenox Avenue, which served as an informal color line until the early 1920s. Some made pacts not to sell to or rent to blacks.Osofsky, \\"Making of a Ghetto\\", in Harlem: A Community in Transition, 1964, p.20 Others tried to buy property and evict black tenants, but the Afro-American Realty Company retaliated by buying other property and evicting whites. Some even attempted to convince banks to deny mortgages to black buyers, but soon gave up those efforts.\\"Loans To White Renegades Who Back Negroes Cut Off\\", Harlem Home News, April 7, 1911 Soon after blacks began to move into Harlem, the community became known as \\"the spiritual home of the Negro protest movement.\\"\\"New York's Racial Unrest: Mounting Negro Anger Swells Protests\\", Layhmond Robinson, The New York Times, August 12, 1963, p.1 The NAACP became active in Harlem in 1910 and Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1916. The NAACP chapter there soon grew to be the largest in the country. Activist A. Philip Randolph lived in Harlem and published the radical magazine The Messenger starting in 1917. It was from Harlem that he organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. W. E. B. Du Bois lived and published in Harlem in the 1920s, as did James Weldon Johnson and Marcus Garvey. Italian Harlems Southern Italians and Sicilians, with a moderate number of Northern Italians, soon predominated, especially in the area east of Lexington Avenue between 96th and 116th Streets and east of Madison Avenue between 116th and 125th Streets, with each street featuring people from different regions of Italy. The neighborhood became known as \\"Italian Harlem\\", the Italian American hub of Manhattan; it was the first part of Manhattan to be referred to as \\"Little Italy\\". p.154 The first Italians arrived in East Harlem in 1878, from Polla in the province of Salerno, and settled in the vicinity of 115th Street.Meyer, Gerald. \\"Italian Harlem: America's Largest and Most Italian Little Italy\\" There were many crime syndicates in Italian Harlem from the early Black Hand to the bigger and more organized Italian gangs that formed the Italian-American Mafia. It was the founding location of the Genovese crime family, one of the Five Families that dominated organized crime in New York City. In the 1920s and early 1930s, Italian Harlem was represented in Congress by future Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, and later by Italian-American socialist Vito Marcantonio. The Italian neighborhood approached its peak in the 1930s, with over 100,000 Italian- Americans living in its crowded, run-down apartment buildings., p.605 \\"Their number increased slightly during the 1930s, when as many as 110,000 Italians lived east of Lexington Avenue between 96th and 116th streets and east of Madison Avenue between 116th and 125th streets.\\" The 1930 census showed that 81 percent of the population of Italian Harlem consisted of first- or second- generation Italian Americans. (Somewhat less than the concentration of Italian Americans in the Lower East Side's Little Italy with 88 percent; Italian Harlem's total population, however, was three times that of Little Italy.) Although in certain areas, particularly around Pleasant Avenue, Italian Harlem lasted through the 1970s, today most of the former Italian population is gone. Most of these predominantly older residents are clustered around Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, mainly from 114th to 118th Streets. According to the 2000 Census, there were only 1,130 Italian-Americans still living in this area.Garland, Sarah. \\"A Reunion of Little Italy in East Harlem\\", The New York Times, September 5, 2006. Accessed January 2, 2008. \\"Now, there are only 1,130 Italian-Americans left in East Harlem, according to the 2000 census.\\" Still, vestiges of the old Italian neighborhood remain. The annual Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the \\"Dancing of the Giglio\\", the first Italian feast in New York City, is still celebrated there every year on the second weekend of August by the Giglio Society of East Harlem. Italian retail establishments still exist, such as Rao's restaurant, started in 1896, and the original Patsy's Pizzeria which opened in the 1933. In May 2011, one of the last remaining Italian retail businesses in the neighborhood, a barbershop owned by Claudio Caponigro on 116th Street, was threatened with closure by a rent increase. 1921–1929 125th Street between Park and Madison Avenues Starting around the time of the end of World War I, Harlem became associated with the New Negro movement, and then the artistic outpouring known as the Harlem Renaissance, which extended to poetry, novels, theater, and the visual arts. The growing population also supported a rich fabric of organizations and activities in the 1920s. Fraternal orders such as the Prince Hall Masons and the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks set up lodges in Harlem, with elaborate buildings including auditoriums and large bands. Parades of lodge members decked out in uniforms and accompanied by band music were a common sight on Harlem's streets, on public holidays, lodge anniversaries, church festivities and funerals.Robertson, Stephen, \\"Parades in 1920s Harlem\\", Digital Harlem Blog, February 1, 2011, accessed October 5, 2011 The neighborhood's churches housed a range of groups, including athletic clubs, choirs and social clubs. A similar range of activities could be found at the YMCA on 135th Street and the YWCA on 137th Street. The social pages of Harlem's two African-American newspapers, the New York Age and the New York Amsterdam News, recorded the meetings, dinners and dances of hundreds of small clubs.Stephen Robertson, Shane White, Stephen Garton and Graham White, \\"This Harlem Life: Black Families and Everyday Life in the 1920s and 1930s\\", Journal of Social History, 44, 1 (Fall 2010) Soapbox speakers drew crowds on Seventh and Lenox Avenues until the 1960s, some offering political oratory, with Hubert Harrison the most famous, while others, particularly in the late 1920s, sold medicine.Watkins-Owens, Irma, Blood Relations: Caribbean Immigrants and the Harlem Community, 1900–1930 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1996), 92–100.Robertson, Stephen, \\"Harlem's Soapbox Speakers\\", Digital Harlem Blog, May 14, 2010, accessed August 22, 2011. Harlem also offered a wealth of sporting events: the Lincoln Giants played baseball at Olympic Field at 136th and Fifth Avenue until 1920, after which residents had to travel to the Catholic Protectory Oval in the Bronx; men's and women's basketball teams from local athletic clubs played in church gymnasiums, and, as they became more popular, at the Manhattan Casino on 155th Street, before giving way to professional teams, most famously the Rens, based at the Renaissance Ballroom on Seventh Avenue;Bob Kuska, Hot Potato: How Washington and New York Gave Birth to Black Basketball and Changed America's Game Forever (Charlottesville, 2004)Robertson, Stephen, \\"Basketball in 1920s Harlem\\", Digital Harlem Blog, June 3, 2011, accessed August 22, 2011. and boxing bouts took place at the Commonwealth Casino on East 135th Street (run by white promoters the McMahon brothers). The biggest crowds, including many whites, came to see black athletes compete against whites.Robertson, Stephen, \\"Harlem and Baseball in the 1920s\\", Digital Harlem Blog, July 27, 2011, accessed August 22, 2011.Kuska, 151 Marcus Garvey Park It took years for business ownership to reflect the new reality. A survey in 1929 found that whites owned and operated 81.51% of the neighborhood's 10,319 businesses, with beauty parlors making up the largest number of black-owned businesses.Greenberg, Cheryl, Or Does It Explode? Black Harlem in the Great Depression (New York, 1991), 27.Robertson, Stephen, \\"Harlem's Beauty Parlors\\", Digital Harlem, September 10, 2010, accessed August 22, 2011 By the late 1960s, 60% of the businesses in Harlem responding to surveys reported ownership by blacks, and an overwhelming fraction of new businesses were black owned after that time.The Economic Development of Harlem, Thomas Vietorisz and Bennett Harrison, Praeger Special Studies in U.S. Economic and Social Development, 1970, p. 37, p. 45, p. 238. Marginalized in the legitimate economy, a small group of blacks found success outside the law, running gambling on numbers. Invented in 1920 or 1921, numbers had exploded by 1924 into a racket turning over tens of millions of dollars every year. That year the New York Age reported that there were at least thirty bankers (the name given to someone running a numbers game) in Harlem, with many employing between twelve and twenty people to collect bets, and Marcellino, the largest banker, employing over one hundred. By the late 1920s, Wallace Thurman guessed there were over a thousand collectors taking bets from 100,000 clients a day.White, Shane, Stephen Garton, Stephen Robertson and Graham White, Playing the Numbers: Gambling in Harlem Between the Wars (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2010), 73–73. The most successful bankers, who could earn enormous sums of money, were known as Kings and Queens. The wealthiest numbers king of all was almost certainly the reputed inventor of the game, Casper Holstein. He owned a fleet of cars, apartment buildings in Harlem and a home on Long Island, but did not have the ostentatious style and lifestyle of many other kings. He, and other bankers, gave money to charities and loans to aspiring businessmen and needy residents. Holstein's role in the community extended further than most of his colleagues, included membership in the Monarch Lodge of the Elks, support for Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, philanthropy in his native Virgin Islands, and patronage of the Harlem Renaissance.White, Garton, Robertson & White, Playing the Numbers (2010), pp. 147–89.\\"Bankers, Kings and Queens\\", Digital Harlem Blog, accessed October 5, 2011. Harlem adapted rapidly to the coming of Prohibition, and its theaters, nightclubs, and speakeasies became major entertainment destinations. Claude McKay would write that Harlem had become \\"an all white picnic ground\\", and in 1927 Rudolph Fisher published an article titled \\"The Caucasian Storms Harlem\\". Langston Hughes described this period at length, including this passage from his 1940 autobiography, In response to the white influx, some blacks operated alternative venues in their homes. Called buffet flats, they offered alcohol, music, dancing, prostitutes, and, commonly, gambling, and, less often, rooms to which a couple could go. Their location in residential buildings, typically on cross streets above 140th Street, away from the nightclubs and speakeasies on the avenues, offered a degree of privacy from police, and from whites: you could only find a buffet flat if you knew the address and apartment number, which hosts did not advertise.Stephen Robertson, \\"Harlem Undercover – the maps\\", Digital Harlem Blog, April 17, 2009, accessed August 23, 2011. Puerto Rican and Latin American immigration after the First World War. p. 265-268 established an enclave at the western portion of East Harlem – around 110th Street and Lexington Avenue – which became known as \\"Spanish Harlem\\". The area slowly grew to encompass all of East Harlem, including Italian Harlem, as Italians moved out – to the Bronx, Brooklyn, upstate New York, and New Jersey – and Hispanics moved in during another wave of immigration in the 1940s and 1950s.Lapp, Michael. \\"East Harlem\\" in , pp. 390–391 The newly dominant Puerto Rican population, which reached 63,000 in 1950, continued to define the neighborhood according to its needs, establishing bodegas and botánicas as it expanded; by the 1930s there was already an enclosed street market underneath the Park Avenue railroad viaduct between 111th and 116th Streets, called \\"La Marqueta\\" (\\"The Market\\"). Catholic and evangelistic Protestant churches appeared in storefronts. Although \\"Spanish Harlem\\" had been in use since at least the 1930s to describe the Hispanic enclave – along with \\"Italian Harlem\\" and \\"Negro Harlem\\", p.253 – around the 1950s the name began to be used to describe the entire East Harlem neighborhood. Later, the name \\"El Barrio\\" (\\"The Neighborhood\\") began to be used, especially by inhabitants of the area. Since the 1920s, this period of Harlem's history has been highly romanticized. With the increase in a poor population, it was also the time when the neighborhood began to deteriorate to a slum, and some of the storied traditions of the Harlem Renaissance were driven by poverty, crime, or other social ills. For example, in this period, Harlem became known for \\"rent parties\\", informal gatherings in which bootleg alcohol was served and music played. Neighbors paid to attend, and thus enabled the host to make his or her monthly rent. Though picturesque, these parties were thrown out of necessity. Further, over a quarter of black households in Harlem made their monthly rent by taking in lodgers, many of whom were family members, but who sometimes brought bad habits or even crime that disrupted the lives of respectable families. Lodgers also experienced disruption, with many having to move frequently when households relocated, roommates quarreled or they could not pay rent.Stephen Robertson, \\"Roger Walker – A Lodger's Life in 1920s Harlem\\", Digital Harlem Blog, June 15, 2010, accessed August 23, 2011. Urban reformers campaigned to eliminate the \\"lodger evil\\" but the problem got worse before it got better; in 1940, still affected by the Depression, 40% of black families in Harlem were taking in lodgers.\\"244,000 Native Sons\\", Look Magazine, May 21, 1940, p. 8+ The high rents and poor maintenance of housing stock, which Harlem residents suffered through much of the 20th century, was not merely the product of racism by white landlords. By 1914, 40% of Harlem's private houses and 10% of its tenements were owned by blacks. Wealthier blacks continued to purchase land in Harlem, and by 1920, a significant portion of the neighborhood was owned by blacks.Inside U.S.A., by John Gunther (1947) specifically cites a black man named A. A. Austin who owned many properties. By the late 1960s, 60% of the businesses in Harlem responding to surveys reported ownership by blacks, and an overwhelming fraction of new businesses were black owned after that time. In 1928, the first effort at housing reform was attempted in Harlem with the construction of the Paul Laurence Dunbar Houses, backed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. These were intended to give working people of modest means the opportunity to live in and, over time, purchase, houses of their own. The Great Depression hit shortly after the buildings opened, and the experiment failed. They were followed in 1936 by the Harlem River Houses, a more modest experiment in housing projects. And by 1964, nine giant public housing projects had been constructed in the neighborhood, housing over 41,000 people. Morningside Park  1930–1945 The job losses of the Depression were exacerbated by the end of Prohibition in 1933 and by the Harlem Riot of 1935, which scared away the wealthier whites who had long supported Harlem's entertainment industry. White audiences decreased almost totally after a second round of riots in 1943. Many Harlemites found work in the military or in the Brooklyn shipyards during World War II,The Economic Development of Harlem, Thomas Vietorisz and Bennett Harrison, Praeger Special Studies in U.S. Economic and Social Development, 1970, p.6 but the neighborhood declined rapidly once the war ended. Some middle-class blacks moved north or west to suburbs, a trend that increased after the 1960s Civil Rights Movement decreased discrimination in housing. The neighborhood enjoyed few benefits from the massive public works projects in New York under Robert Moses in the 1930s, and as a result had fewer parks and public recreational sites than other New York neighborhoods. Of the 255 playgrounds Moses built in New York City, he placed only one in Harlem. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. addressing a citizens' committee mass meeting in 1942 The earliest activism by blacks to change the situation in Harlem itself grew out of the Great Depression, with the \\"Don't Buy Where You Can't Work\\" movement.John Henrik Clarke (ed.), Harlem U.S.A., introduction to 1971 edition. This was the ultimately successful campaign to force retail shops on 125th Street to hire black employees. Boycotts were originally organized by the Citizens' League for Fair Play in June 1934 against Blumstein's Department Store on 125th Street. The store soon agreed to integrate its staff more fully. This success emboldened Harlem residents, and protests continued under other leadership, including that of preacher and later congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., seeking to change hiring practices at other stores, to effect the hiring of more black workers, or the hiring of members of particular protesting groups.Fact Not Fiction In Harlem, John H. Johnson, St. Martin's Church, 1980., p.52+ Communism gained a following in Harlem in the 1930s, and continued to play a role through the 1940s. In 1935, the first of Harlem's five riots broke out. The incident started with a boy that was supposedly caught stealing from a store on 125th Street had been killed by the police. By the time it was over, 600 stores had been looted and three men were dead. The same year saw internationalism in Harlem politics, as Harlemites responded to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia by holding giant rallies, signing petitions and sending an appeal to the League of Nations.\\"Africa-Conscious Harlem\\", in Clarke, Harlem U.S.A.\\" (1971), p. 50. Such internationalism continued intermittently, including broad demonstrations in favor of Egyptian president Nasser after the Suez invasion of 1956.\\"Africa-Conscious Harlem\\", in Clarke, Harlem U.S.A.\\" (1971), p. 51. Black Harlemites took positions in the elected political infrastructure of New York starting in 1941 with the election of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. to the City Council. He was easily elected to Congress when a congressional district was placed in Harlem in 1944, leaving his City Council seat to be won by another black Harlemite, Benjamin J. Davis. Ironically, Harlem's political strength soon deteriorated, as Clayton Powell, Jr. spent his time in Washington or his vacation home in Puerto Rico, and Davis was jailed in 1951 for violations of the Smith Act.\\"Four Men of Harlem – The Movers and the Shakers\\", in Clarke, Harlem U.S.A.\\" (1971), p. 262. The year 1943 saw the second Harlem riot. Allegedly, a black soldier knocked down a policeman who then shot him. An onlooker shouted that the soldier had been killed, and this news spread throughout the black community and provoked rioting. A force of 6,600, made up of city police, military police and civil patrolmen, in addition to 8,000 State Guardsmen and 1,500 civilian volunteers was required to end the violence. Hundreds of businesses were destroyed and looted, the property damage approaching $225,000. Overall, six people died and 185 were injured. Five hundred people were arrested in connection with the riot. 1946–1969 Malcolm X at a 1964 press conference Many groups mobilized in Harlem in the 1960s, fighting for better schools, jobs, and housing. Some were peaceful and others advocated violence. By the early 1960s, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) had offices on 125th street, and acted as negotiator for the community with the city, especially in times of racial unrest. They urged civilian review boards to hear complaints of police abuse, a demand that was ultimately met. As chairman of the House Committee of Education and Labor at the start of the 1960s, Adam Clayton Powell Jr. used this position to direct federal funds to various development projects in Harlem.\\"Four Men of Harlem – The Movers and the Shakers\\", in Clarke, Harlem U.S.A.\\" (1971), p. 264. The largest public works projects in Harlem in these years were public housing, with the largest concentration built in East Harlem.\\"A Landmark Struggle,\\" Lisa Davis, Preservation Online, November 21, 2003 Typically, existing structures were torn down and replaced with city-designed and managed properties that would, in theory, present a safer and more pleasant environment than those available from private landlords. Ultimately, community objections halted the construction of new projects. From the mid-20th century, the terrible quality of local schools has been a source of distress. In the 1960s, about 75% of Harlem students tested under grade levels in reading skills, and 80% tested under grade level in math.Pinkney & Woock, Poverty and Politics in Harlem (1970), p. 33. In 1964, residents of Harlem staged two school boycotts to call attention to the problem. In central Harlem, 92% of students stayed home.\\"Harlem Stirs\\", 1966, p. 104. 1960s race riots An incident at 133rd Street and Seventh Avenue during the Harlem Riot of 1964. The influence of the southern nonviolent protest movement was muted in Harlem. Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was the black leader most respected in Harlem.Pinkney & Woock, Poverty and Politics in Harlem (1970), p. 41.Pinkney & Woock, Poverty and Politics in Harlem (1970), p. 99. But on September 20, 1958, Izola Curry, deluded into believing the NAACP was controlled by Communists, approached Dr. King at a Blumstein's book-signing, and asked him if he was Martin Luther King, Jr. When King replied in the affirmative, she said, \\"I've been looking for you for five years\\", then thrust a letter opener into his chest. NYPD officers took King, still in the chair where he had sat, to an ambulance that took him to Harlem Hospital, for removal of the blade. Reportage recalling the event for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 2014, noted: At least two dozen groups of black nationalists also operated in New York, many of them in Harlem. The most important of these was the Nation of Islam, whose Temple Number Seven was run by Malcolm X from 1952–1963.E. U. Essien- Udom, \\"The Nationalist Movements of Harlem\\", in Harlem: A Community in Transition, 1964, p. 97. Malcolm X was assassinated in the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights in 1965.

In 1963, Inspector Lloyd Sealy became the first African- American officer of the NYPD to command a police station, the 28th precinct in Harlem.New York City Police Museum: A History of African Americans in the NYPD Community relations between Harlem residents and the NYPD were strained as civil rights activists requested that the NYPD hire more black police officers, specifically in Harlem. In 1964, across Harlem's three precincts, the ratio was one black police officer for every six white officers.\\"No Place Like Home\\", Time Magazine. A riot broke in the summer of 1964 following the fatal shooting of an unarmed 15-year-old black teenager by an off-duty white police lieutenant. One person was killed, more than 100 were injured, and hundreds more were arrested. Property damage and looting were extensive. The riot would later spread out of Manhattan and into the borough of Brooklyn and neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the heart of Brooklyn's African-American community. In the aftermath of the riots, the federal government funded a pilot program called Project Uplift, in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by HARYOU called Youth in the Ghetto.Youth in the Ghetto: A Study of the Consequences of Powerlessness, Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited, Inc., 1964. HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, along with the National Urban League and nearly 100 smaller community organizations.Alphonso Pinkney & Roger Woock, Poverty and Politics in Harlem, College & University Press Services, Inc., 1970. In 1966, the Black Panthers organized a group in Harlem, agitating for violence in pursuit of change. Speaking at a rally of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Max Stanford, a Black Panther, declared that the United States \\"could be brought down to its knees with a rag and some gasoline and a bottle.\\"\\"Black Panthers Open Harlem Drive\\", Amsterdam News, September 3, 1966. In 1968, Harlemites rioted after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., as did black residents in other U.S. cities. Two people died—one stabbed to death in a crowd and another trapped in a burning building. However, the rioting in New York was minor compared to that in other American cities. Mayor John Lindsay helped to quell the rioting by marching up Lenox Avenue in a \\"hail of bricks\\" to confront the angry crowds.Vincent J. Cannato, The Ungovernable City, John Lindsay and His Struggle to Save New York, p. 211. (See also King assassination riots.) Housing stock Little investment in private homes or businesses took place in the neighborhood between 1911 and the 1990s. However, the unwillingness of landlords elsewhere in the city to rent to black tenants, together with a significant increase in the black population of New York, meant that rents in Harlem were for many years higher than rents elsewhere in the city, even as the housing stock decayed. In 1920, one-room apartments in central Harlem rented for $40 to whites or $100–$125 to blacks.\\"Landlord Brings in Negroes to Get High Rents\\", The New York Times, January 27, 1920. In the late 1920s, a typical white working-class family in New York paid $6.67 per month per room, while blacks in Harlem paid $9.50 for the same space.\\"Gilbert Osofsky, 1963\\" The worse the accommodations and more desperate the renter, the higher the rents would be.\\"Powell Says Rent Too High\\", New York Post, March 28, 1935. This pattern persisted through the 1960s; in 1965, CERGE reported that a one-room apartment in Harlem rented for $50–$74, while comparable apartments rented for $30–$49 in white slums.\\"Harlem Stirs, 1966, p.17\\" The high rents encouraged some property speculators to engage in block busting, a practice whereby they would acquire a single property on a block and sell or rent it to blacks with great publicity. Other landowners would panic, and the speculators would then buy additional houses relatively cheaply.\\"Harlem, the Making of a Ghetto\\", Gilbert Osofsky, in Harlem U.S.A. (1971 ed.), p. 12. These houses could then be rented profitably to blacks.Bruce Perry, Station Hill, Malcolm, 1991, p. 155. After the Harlem River Houses, America's first federally subsidized housing project, were opened in 1937, other massive housing projects soon followed, with tens of thousands of units constructed over the next twenty years, especially in Harlem.East Harlem's History, New Directions: A 197-A Plan for Manhattan Community district 11 (Revised 1999).

Consequently, Harlem is referred to as the \\"Black Mecca\\" the capital of black America, and arguably the most recognized black community in the country.\\" The character of the community changed in the years after the war, as middle-class blacks left for the outer boroughs (primarily the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn) and suburbs. The percentage of Harlem that was black peaked in 1950, at 98.2%.Pinkney & Woock, Poverty and Politics in Harlem (1970), p. 27. Thereafter, Hispanic, Asian, and white residents have increased their share. The high cost of space forced people to live in close quarters, and the population density of Harlem in these years was stunning—over 215,000 per square mile in the 1920s. By comparison, in 2000, Manhattan as a whole had a population density under 70,000 per square mile.Demographia population density figures The same forces that allowed landlords to charge more for Harlem space also enabled them to maintain it less, and many of the residential buildings in Harlem fell into disrepair. The 1960 census showed only 51% of housing in Harlem to be \\"sound\\", as opposed to 85% elsewhere in New York City.Pinkney & Woock, Poverty and Politics in Harlem (1970), p. 29. In 1968, the New York City Buildings Department received 500 complaints daily of rats in Harlem buildings, falling plaster, lack of heat, and unsanitary plumbing. Tenants were sometimes to blame; some would strip wiring and fixtures from their buildings to sell, throw garbage in hallways and airshafts, or otherwise damage the properties which they lived in or visited.Bruce Perry, Station Hill, Malcolm, 1991, p. 156. Harlem has many townhouses, such as these in the Mount Morris Historic District. As the building stock decayed, landlords converted many buildings into \\"single room occupancies\\", or SROs, essentially private homeless shelters. In many cases, the income from these buildings could not support the fines and city taxes charged to their owners, or the houses suffered damage that would have been expensive to fix, and the buildings were abandoned. In the 1970s, this process accelerated to the point that Harlem, for the first time since before World War I, had a lower population density than the rest of Manhattan. Between 1970 and 1980, for example, Frederick Douglass Boulevard between 110th Street and 125th Street in central Harlem lost 42% of its population and 23% of its remaining housing stock.Stern, Fishman & Tilove, New York 2000 (2006), p. 1021. By 1987, 65% of the buildings in Harlem were owned by the City of New York,\\"City Hall Holds The Key. Harlem's renaissance finds lots of friends, and a few foes\\", Christian Science Monitor, March 12, 1987.The Economic Redevelopment of Harlem, PhD Thesis of Eldad Gothelf, submitted to Columbia University in May 200460% by 1980, per Stern, Fishman & Tilove, New York 2000 (2006), p. 1015. and many had become empty shells, convenient centers for drug dealing and other illegal activity. The lack of habitable buildings and falling population reduced tax rolls and made the neighborhood even less attractive to residential and retail investment. The doorframe of a brownstone designed by William Tuthill in the Mount Morris Historical District in Harlem. Inadequate housing contributed to racial unrest and health problems. However, the lack of development also preserved buildings from the 1870–1910 building boom, and Harlem as a result has many of the finest original townhouses in New York. This includes work by many significant architects of the day, including McKim, Mead, and White; James Renwick; William Tuthill; Charles Buek; and Francis Kimball. 1970–1989 By some measures, the 1970s was the darkest period in Harlem's history. Some Harlemites left the neighborhood in search of safer streets and better schools in the suburbs, those who remained would contribute greatly to local efforts in revitalising the sprawling community despite external efforts to prove otherwise. For example, the federal government's Model Cities Program spent $100 million on job training, health care, education, public safety, sanitation, housing, and other projects over a ten- year period, Harlem showed no improvement.\\"Harlem's Dreams Have Died in Last Decade, Leaders Say\\", New York Times, March 1, 1978, p. A1. This article shows the ravine between white institutions and the Black community, often filled with ambiguity and racially charged justifications for socially approved negative judgments on and of the latter. The numbers following reflect the results of corrupt representation instigated by outside agitators with financial interests in Harlem: The deterioration shows up starkly in the statistics of the period. In 1968, Harlem's infant mortality rate had been 37 for each 1000 live births, as compared to 23.1 in the city as a whole. Over the next eight years, infant mortality for the city as whole improved to 19, while the rate in Harlem increased to 42.8, more than double. Statistics describing illness, drug addiction, housing quality, and education are similarly grim and typically show rapid deterioration in the 1970s. The wholesale abandonment of housing was so pronounced that between 1976 and 1978 alone, central Harlem lost almost a third of its total population, and east Harlem lost about 27%. The neighborhood no longer had a functioning economy; stores were shuttered and by estimates published in 1971, 60% of the area's economic life depended on the cash flow from the illegal \\"Numbers game\\" alone.\\"The Black Mafia Moves Into the Numbers Racket\\", Fred J. Cook, New York Times, April 4, 1971. The most dangerous part of Harlem was the \\"Bradhurst section\\" between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Edgecombe, from 139th Street through 155th. In 1991, this region was described in the New York Times as follows: \\"Since 1970, an exodus of residents has left behind the poor, the uneducated, the unemployed. Nearly two-thirds of the households have incomes below $10,000 a year. In a community with one of the highest crime rates in the city, garbage-strewn vacant lots and tumbledown tenements, many of them abandoned and sealed, contribute to the sense of danger and desolation that pervades much of the area.\\"\\"Harlem Battles Over Development Project\\", Shipp, E. R., New York Times, July 31, 1991, p. B.1. Aerial view of Harlem with river, seen from north (2010) Plans for rectifying the situation often started with the restoration of 125th Street, long the economic heart of black Harlem.\\"Harlem Pins Revival Hopes on New Plans for 125th Street\\", New York Times, May 20, 1979 By the late 1970s, only marginalized and poor retail remained.Stern, Fishman & Tilove, New York 2000 (2006), p. 1007. Plans were drafted for a \\"Harlem International Trade Center\\", which would have filled the entire block between 125th Street and 126th, from Lenox to Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, with a center for trade with the third world. A related retail complex was planned to the west, between Frederick Douglass Boulevard and St. Nicholas. However, this plan depended on $30 million in financing from the federal government, and with the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency of the United States, it had no hope of being completed. The city did provide one large construction project, though not so favored by residents. Starting in the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s, Harlemites fought the introduction of an immense sewage treatment plant, the North River Water Pollution Control Plant, on the Hudson River in West Harlem. A compromise was ultimately reached in which the plant was built with a state park, including extensive recreational facilities, on top. The park, called Riverbank State Park, was opened in 1993 (the sewage plant having been completed some years earlier).Stern, Fishman & Tilove, New York 2000 (2006), p. 1039. The city began auctioning its enormous portfolio of Harlem properties to the public in 1985. This was intended to improve the community by placing property in the hands of people who would live in them and maintain them. In many cases, the city would even pay to completely renovate a property before selling it (by lottery) below market value.Stern, Fishman & Tilove, New York 2000 (2006), p. 1016 The program was soon beset by scandal—buyers were acquiring houses from the city, then making deals with churches or other charities in which they would inflate the appraised values of the properties and the church or charity would take out federally guaranteed 203(k) mortgage and buy it. The original buyer would realize a profit and the church or charity would default on the mortgage (presumably getting some kind of kickback from the developer).\\"Harlem Tenants Fear Displacement After 203(k) Scandal\\"\\"SRO Limbo: After Arrests in the HUD Scandal, Will Its Victims Lose Their Homes?\\" Andrew Friedman, Village Voice, January 16–22, 2002. Abandoned shells were left to further deteriorate, and about a third of the properties sold by the city were tenements which still had tenants, who were left in particularly miserable conditions. These properties, and new restrictions on Harlem mortgages, bedeviled the area's residential real estate market for years. 1990–present After four decades of decline, Central Harlem's population bottomed out in the 1990 census, at 101,026. It had decreased by 57% from its peak of 237,468 in 1950. Between 1990 and 2015 the neighborhood's population grew by 16.8%, with the percentage of black people decreasing from 87.6% to 62%,Community Health Profiles 2015 Manhattan Community District 10: Central Harlem, 2015 During this time, there was a significant drop to 54.4% in 2010,\\"Census trends: Young, white Harlem newcomers aren't always welcomed,\\" New York Daily News, December 26, 2010 while the percentage of whites increased from 1.5% to 10% by 2015. Hispanics are the second largest demographic in Central Harlem, making up 23% of the population as of 2015, however, although whites make up only 10% of the population, they are the fastest growing demographic, with a 678% increase since 1990. From 1987 through 1990, the city removed long-unused trolley tracks from 125th Street, laid new water mains and sewers, installed new sidewalks, curbs, traffic lights, streetlights, and planted trees. Two years later, national chains opened branches on 125th Street for the first time – The Body Shop opened a store at 125th street and 5th Avenue, and a Ben & Jerry's ice cream franchise employing formerly homeless people opened across the street.Stern, Fishman & Tilove, New York 2000 (2006), p. 1009. Neither store is extant. The development of the region would leap forward a few years later with the 1994 introduction of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, which brought $300 million in development funds and $250 million in tax breaks.Stern, Fishman & Tilove, New York 2000 (2006), p. 1011. Plans were laid for shopping malls, movie theaters, and museums. However, these plans were nearly derailed by the 1995 attack on Freddy's Fashion Mart which killed 8 people. These riots did not resemble their predecessors, and were organized by black activists against Jewish shop owners on 125th street.\\"'Freddy's Not Dead',\\" Peter Noel, Village Voice, December 23, 1998.

In the same year, former president Bill Clinton took office space in Harlem, at 55 West 125th Street.\\"New boy in the 'hood,\\" The Observer, August 5, 2001 In 2002, a large retail and office complex called Harlem Center was completed at the corner of Lenox and 125th. There has been extensive new construction and rehabilitation of older buildings in the years since. After years of false starts, Harlem began to see rapid gentrification in the late 1990s. This was driven by changing federal and city policies, including fierce crime fighting and a concerted effort to develop the retail corridor on 125th Street. The number of housing units in Harlem increased by 14% between 1990 and 2000, and the rate of increase has been much more rapid in recent years. Property values in Central Harlem increased nearly 300% during the 1990s, while the rest of New York City saw only a 12% increase. Even empty shells of buildings in the neighborhood were routinely selling for nearly $1,000,000 each as of 2007.\\"After the Shell Game\\", S. Jhoanna Robledo, New York Magazine, March 26, 2007, p. 69. The article states that, after rocketing upwards for many years, prices on shells have settled to about the same level in 2007 as they had been in 2005. Examples are given of sales around $800,000. In January 2010, The New York Times reported that in \\"Greater Harlem\\", which they defined as running from the East River to the Hudson River, from 96th Street to 155th Street, blacks ceased to be a majority of the population in 1998, with the change largely attributable to the rapid arrival of new white and Hispanic residents. The paper reported that the population of the area had grown more since 2000 than in any decade since the 1940s.\\"In Harlem, Blacks Are No Longer a Majority,\\" Sam Roberts, The New York Times, January 6, 2010, p.

The Flemish Government introduced an additional insurance for non-medical care () in 2001, which proved to be controversial and has a relatively long legal history. Healthcare and social security in Belgium is a federal matter, but the special laws of Belgium grants the three communities several competences, such as \\"assistance to persons\\".Special law concerning institutional reforms, title 2, art. 5 § 1 II (French, Dutch) The Flemish Government made use of this to provide an additional insurance for non-medical help and services, mainly targeted at elderly people. The insurance is mandatory for all people aged 25 and above and living in the Flemish Region, and optional for inhabitants of the Brussels-Capital Region (as Brussels is covered by both the Flemish and French Community). Controversy and legal issues The French Community, however, feared this was a first step towards splitting the Belgian social security and found this service to be discriminatory. They fought this at the Constitutional Court, and tried to come up with legal arguments to repeal the decree (as laws by communities and regions are called), but to no avail.Constitution Court ruling 2009-11: Dutch, French, German The system was however slightly adapted several times to suit their justified complaints. The Constitutional Court sent a prejudicial question to the European Court of Justice, who inspected the decree. They do consider this insurance to be social security, as opposed to Belgian terms, and they judged that the \\"place of residence criteria\\" as used in the decree (i.e. the insurance is for those living in Flanders or Brussels) violates the \\"work place criteria\\" that EU law dictates for social security for EU citizens who made use of their right of freedom of movement. People working in a country where they do not live must enjoy the same social rights as citizens of that state. Consequently, the Flemish decree was adapted to provide this insurance also for people working in Flanders or Brussels but not living there, as long as they made use of their right of free movement. Since EU law only recognizes \\"Belgium\\" and not the various entities within it, this does not include Walloons working in Flanders. As a result, anyone living or working in Flanders or Brussels enjoy this insurance, except Walloons unless they made use of their right of free movement.

Many Orlit Posts can be found near ROC Monitoring Posts. History Experience from WW2 identified that there would be a need for increased protection from enemy aircraft if the UK was ever faced with the prospact of being at war again. Although the ROC was finding that aircraft monitoring was becoming increasingly difficult to plot with the development of new faster aircraft, new aircraft monitoring posts were developed to assist observers to monitor aircraft. The idea for these new posts originated in 1947, however it was only during 1951/52 as part of the programme to update the air defences through the Rotor Plan that more substantial buildings were built to offer at least some level of protection from the elements or attack. Although some of these new structures were built of brick, many sites received pre-cast concrete panelled structures known as \\"Orlit\\" posts, after the manufacturers of the structures Messrs Orlit Ltd. These Orlit structures were split into two sections. The entrance door led into the smaller roofed section which was used as a shelter and store with a sliding door into the open section which housed the post instrument and chart on top of a wooden mounting. Two types of Orlit posts existed, the Orlit 'A' was at ground level and the Orlit 'B' was raised 6 ft on four legs with a ladder for access.

She began as a collector then working with museums to promote handcrafts and then working to found a number of museums and other organizations to the same purpose. She became one of Mexico’s foremost experts on the subject, serving as director of different organizations and judge at competitions in Mexico and abroad. She died in 2010 while she was serving as the director of the Museo Universitario de Artes Populares of the University of Colima, which changed its name to honor her. Life She was born on December 15, 1919 in Guanajuato, Guanajuato. She moved to Guadalajara as a child, following her father who was a professional musician. There her mother died when she was only eight years old and was raised by her grandmother Antonia Badajos. Starting in 1940, she began collecting Mexican handcrafts and folk art. At first she kept her acquisitions in her apartment but soon it was overflowing and she rented the apartment across from her to use as storage. Later she acquired a house in Coyoacán which was larger to accommodate her growing collection which included textiles, glass, miniatures, toys, cartonería, niños dios, nativity scenes and much more. She died on January 12, 2010 in Mexico City. She was buried at the Panteón Jardín in Mexico City. Career As a collector, she began to research the items and the people who made them. She also made her collections available for special exhibitions in both Mexico and abroad until her death, for example the lending of 99 niños dios figures to the Instituto de Desarrollo Artesanal del Estado de Zacatecas for a temporary exhibit. She also made donations to museums in both Mexico and abroad including textiles to the Museo de Arte Popular in Sao Paulo, Brazil and the Sobichille Museum in Siena, Italy. Her donation of 1,700 pieces to the Museo de Guanajuato allowed for the opening of a hall dedicated to miniatures. She was an integral part of the establishment of museums and other institutions dedicated to the promotion of Mexican handcrafts and folk art including those in Hermosillo, Tabasco, Chiapas, Puebla, Jalisco, Querétaro, Veracruz, Mexico City, Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Tlaxcala and Monterrey. She also was founder or co- founder of other institutions as well such as the Na Bolom Cultural Association and the POPULART AC Association. She participated at the formation of the Casa de las Artesanías of the State of Mexico, the Fondo Nacional para al Fomento de las Artesanías, the Populart Association and the Sna Jolobil organization in Chiapas. Her work made her one of Mexico’s foremost experts in handcrafts. She was curator of over 130 exhibitions, the most important of which related to textiles. She served as a judge for over three hundred handcraft competitions in Mexico. She also served in similar events in Cuba, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Colombia and the United States. Pomar was also a researcher, spending her life to research and preserve community and indigenous traditions along with handcrafts. She was the director of the Museo Nacional de Artes e Industrias Populares of the Instituto Nacional Indigenista. She promoted the teaching of handcrafts in schools in order to keep it as a vital part of Mexican culture. Her work documenting the copper work in Santa Clara del Cobre earned her the Manuel Gamio Prize in 1985. She received the Diego Rivera State Art Prize by the Colima state congress in 2007.

In 1871, Professor Henry Ingersoll Bowditch established the first U.S. vivisection lab at Harvard Medical School, inciting concern from Edward Clement, editor-in-chief of the Boston Evening Transcript, which subsequently ran a series of anti-vivisection editorials. In 1890 George Angell and the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA) held an essay contest entitled “Why I Am Against Vivisection.” The winner of the contest, Joseph Greene of Dorchester, Massachusetts, later reached out to lawyer and doctor Philip Peabody, one of the contest judges, with the idea of forming an anti-vivisection society. Peabody agreed, and Greene began organizing a number of Boston's influential individuals. The first NEAVS meeting was held at Peabody's house on March 30, 1895, and the first office was opened at 179A Tremont St. in Boston on Sep. 12 of the same year, with Peabody serving as NEAVS president. When Clement became president in 1911, his journalistic expertise boosted both public awareness of vivisection and membership in the organization. Author Cleveland Amory was NEAVS president from 1987 until 1998. He has been described as \\"the founding father of the modern animal protection movement.” In anticipation of his retirement, Amory appointed a nominating committee that chose psychologist and former NEAVS board member, Theodora Capaldo, EdD, to succeed him. She was elected NEAVS’ first woman president in 1998. Amory died unexpectedly later that same year. Capaldo and her newly elected board of directors came with extensive animal protection and animal rights experience and have included individuals with medical, veterinary, psychology, mental health, sociology, and legal credentials, such as Sarah Luick, Esq., a founding member of the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF). Under Capaldo, the board and staff developed and implemented a succession of new and effective strategies with which to achieve the organization's sole mission of ending the use of animals in science and replacing them with non-animal and scientifically superior alternatives. Highlights of those programs include campaigning to end the use in research of the first nonhuman species, chimpanzees – human's closest genetic relative (Project R&R;: Release and Restitution for Chimpanzees in U.S. Laboratories); ending the use of terminal dog labs at the first veterinary school in the country, a curriculum shift later followed by other schools; and, most recently, reaching out to and incorporating other social movements into the animal protection movement. Examples include support for women doing research that does not involve animals and is aimed at understanding, among other things, sex differences’ effect on biomedical research results as well as the implications of such differences for the use of other species to extrapolate animal data to human health; and environmentalism through investigation of the serious and detrimental environmental impact that the use and disposal of millions of animals used in research, testing, and education has on the environment (women and the environment are the core of NEAVS’ Common Ground campaign). Since September 2017, Nathan Herschler, J.D. has served as Executive Director. The philosophy of NEAVS emphasizes that the use of animals in research, testing, and education is unscientific, as shown in numerous studies; is unnecessary due to the availability of and continuing development of alternatives that yield results superior to animal use; and that the humane and ethical arguments against the suffering and death of millions of animals in labs each year has never been stronger given how modern science shows animal use has limitations, dangers, and is little or no benefit to human health. Today, NEAVS continues its work through public outreach, education, legislation and policy change, supporting animal sanctuaries, and funding the development of alternatives to animals in research and science education.  Accomplishments =Draize eye irritancy test alternative In 1981 NEAVS and its sister organization the American Fund for Alternatives to Animal Research (AFAAR) funded research at Tufts University Medical School for an alternative to the Draize test, which applies chemicals such as pesticides, household products, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics to the eyes of rabbits. The resulting alternative was later used by a number of product and cosmetics companies. Repeal of pound seizure in Massachusetts In 1983 NEAVS successfully lobbied to repeal Massachusetts’ 1957 pound seizure law, which required animal shelters to sell animals for use in research. This work resulted in the first and strongest anti-pound seizure law in the U.S. As of 2013, 18 states had banned pound seizure. LD50 alternative In 1985, NEAVS began funding Bjorn Ekwall, PhD, chairman of the Cytotoxicology Laboratory (CTLU) in Sweden, a laboratory which designs and validates alternatives to animal research, to develop an in vitro method of toxicology testing capable of replacing the LD50 test, which assesses substance toxicity based on the dose that kills 50% of animals in the test. The resulting test better predicted human lethal blood concentrations. Terminal laboratories in veterinary education In 2000 collaboration between NEAVS and Tufts University's Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine led Tufts to become the first U.S. veterinary school without a terminal lab requirement, a procedure where students train on live animals before euthanizing them. As a replacement, NEAVS helped develop an alternative program involving spay/neuter surgeries for homeless cats. A survey completed by the Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association in 2007 indicated that half of U.S. vet schools no longer require terminal labs in core courses. Dissection choice policy in Massachusetts NEAVS’ affiliate, the Ethical Science and Education Coalition (ESEC), lobbied and testified before the Massachusetts state legislature in support of a bill that would have given public school students the right to opt out of dissection classes. In 2004 after the bill was vetoed by Governor Mitt Romney, who said that the decision should be made by the Massachusetts Department of Education, ESEC's continued advocacy led the State Board of Education to issue a policy in 2005 allowing students to choose alternatives to dissection. Protection of chimpanzees from biomedical research NEAVS launched its national Project R&R;: Release and Restitution for Chimpanzees in U.S. Laboratories campaign in 2003 to end the use of chimpanzees in invasive biomedical research and provide them permanent homes in sanctuary. Soon after, other organizations allied with NEAVS and after a decade of advocacy the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced it would retire almost 90% of its chimpanzees to sanctuary.  Current campaigns =Release and restitution for chimpanzees Launched in 2004, NEAVS’ national campaign, Project R&R;: Release and Restitution for Chimpanzees in U.S. Laboratories, aims to end all biomedical research using chimpanzees in the U.S. and to retire them sanctuary. As part of this campaign, NEAVS published a number of scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals examining the utility of chimpanzees in biomedical research. Paper topics include findings of research chimpanzee autopsy reports, the implications of genetic differences between chimpanzees and humans, and the applicability of using chimpanzees as research models for cancer, hepatitis C, and AIDS. NEAVS also lobbied Congress in support of the Great Ape Protection and Cost Savings Act (GAPCSA), first introduced in 2008 and again in 2011. If passed, GAPSCA would retire all federally owned chimpanzees to sanctuary and phase out the use of great apes in biomedical research. In 2010 NEAVS, along with other animal protection organizations, petitioned the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to review a policy listing chimpanzees as “endangered” under the Endangered Species Act when found in the wild and “threatened” when in captivity. The petition aimed to reclassify captive chimpanzees as endangered. On June 11, 2013 FWS proposed changing the policy and opened a public comment period. In 2000, the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection (CHIMP) Act was signed into law, authorizing the retirement of chimpanzees in research who were “not needed.” More than a decade later, roughly 900 chimpanzees remained in U.S. labs and the vast majority were not being used. In 2012, NEAVS and others organizations submitted a rulemaking petition to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) asking for criteria defining when chimpanzees are no longer needed. On June 26, 2013, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced it would move forward with plans to retire almost 90% of its chimpanzees to sanctuary. Ethical Science Education Coalition The Ethical Science Education Coalition (ESEC) is NEAVS’ educational affiliate. ESEC's mission is to “end the harmful use of animals at all levels of science education” by providing resources and services that support alternatives to the use of animals in education, specifically the use of animals in terminal labs, live animal demonstrations, training courses, and dissection. ESEC is a proponent of dissection choice legislation and policies which provide students the right to choose alternatives to animal use in their education. Common ground: animals, women, environment NEAVS’ Common Ground initiative includes two initial campaigns incorporating support for women in science and environmental stewardship with its animals in research mission. Animal Research is Hazardous Waste examines the millions of animals bred, used, and disposed as contaminated or hazardous waste. NEAVS’ Fellowship Grant for Alternatives to Animal Research in Women's Health and Sex Differences funds a woman committed to alternatives to animal methods in the investigation of women's health or sex differences in research results. NEAVS’ campaign against hormone replacement therapy drugs made from the urine of pregnant horses encourages women to use alternatives. Alternatives NEAVS supports using alternatives to animals in research, testing, and education, and promotes in vitro, epidemiological, and clinical study data as more predictive for humans. NEAVS funds scientists developing alternatives, and advocates for policies requiring use of validated animal alternatives in research and testing. In the 21st century billions of animals have been exposed to cruelty, for human's benefit, in the United States and dozens of other countries worldwide through animal testing of consumer products. Laboratories sticking painful eye irritants into restrained rabbit's eyes to test an eye product and cats being forced to have brain electrocutions to test for neurological pharmaceutical drugs are just two of hundreds of products tested on animals according to PETA (peta.org). Animals don't have to be used for human's wants. Scientists Burch and Russell created the 3Rs: reduction, refinement and replacement to further anti-vivisection. In these 3 Rs alternative successful approaches to testing consumer products have been created. Alternatives like in vitro, computer simulations, cell and tissue samples, and mannequins are reducing the millions of sentient animals forced into cruel and painful experiments worldwide. Howard, Carol. “Yes, Dad, There Are Alternatives.” AV Magazine. Spring 2005. Pgs. 1-4 Yes, Dad, There Are Alternatives American Fund for Alternatives to Animal Research The American Fund for Alternatives to Animal Research (AFAAR) is NEAVS’ sister organization. Founded by Ethel Thurston, PhD, in 1977, AFAAR's mission is to “promote and assist the development and use of alternatives to animals in science.” Together, NEAVS and AFAAR have funded alternatives to common animal testing procedures such as the LD50 and Draize test for toxicity. Currently, AFAAR and NEAVS offer a one-year postdoctoral fellowship grant to fund women researchers who work to develop, validate, or use animal alternatives in investigating women's health or sex differences in research results. Cruelty-free cosmetics and products NEAVS is a founding member of the Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (CCIC) and its Leaping Bunny program, which provides consumers with information about certified, cruelty-free companies that do not use animal testing during any product development stage. NEAVS is also the U.S. Executive Office for Cruelty Free International, founded by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV). Cruelty Free International works to end the use of animals in product testing worldwide. Legislation and policy NEAVS policy advocacy includes petitioning the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to require, when existing, validated alternatives in place of animal testing through the Mandatory Alternatives Petition (MAP) Coalition, lobbying for dissection choice, petitioning the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list captive chimpanzees as endangered along with wild chimpanzees, and lobbying for the Great Ape Protection and Cost Savings Act (GAPCSA) that would end invasive research on chimpanzees and retire all federally owned chimpanzees to sanctuary. Sanctuary support Through its Sanctuary Fund, NEAVS makes grants to organizations providing lifetime care for animals previously used in research. Sanctuaries funded include Animals Asia Foundation, Chimp Haven, Fauna Foundation, and Save the Chimps. NEAVS also makes lifetime care commitments to animals in sanctuary and helped support the formation of the North American Primate Sanctuary Alliance.

Roses (Rosas) is located northeast of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. The action occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. In the summer and fall of 1808, an Imperial French corps under Guillaume Philibert Duhesme was isolated in Barcelona by a 24,000-man Spanish army led by Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu. With 23,000 men, Gouvion Saint-Cyr moved from the French border to relieve Duhesme's troops. The first obstacle to Gouvion Saint-Cyr's mission was the haven of Roses defended by a large citadel with sea approaches defended by a headland castle. The 3,500 Catalan and Spanish defenders of Roses were mostly local miquelets (militia) stiffened by a small unit of regulars from the Fija de Roses garrison. Although assisted by a bombardment of the French lines by several British warships commanded by Captain Robert Hallowell, and a strong defence of the castle by Catalan regulars and militia with men of the 38-gun frigate commanded by Thomas Cochrane, the garrison was unable to prevent the advance of the Franco-Italian siege lines tightening its grip around the citadel. The defenders eventually capitulated, the soldiers and civilians inside the citadel being taken into captivity in Figueres and the local defenders of the castle being taken by the British to join Vives' Spanish forces in the marshes to the south. Gouvion Saint-Cyr still faced the problem of getting past Girona in order to succor Duhesme's soldiers. The French general made a bold but risky maneuver and the result was the Battle of Cardadeu on 16 December. Background=Initial operations Emperor Napoleon I plotted to replace the royal family of the Kingdom of Spain. Pursuant to his design, he ordered several key points, including Barcelona, to be seized in February 1808.Gates (2002), 10-11 On 29 February, General of Division Giuseppe Lechi's Imperial French troops were marching through Barcelona, ostensibly to help fight Portugal. Lechi staged a military review, but it was a cover for gaining control of the citadel. As the soldiers marched past the main gate of the fortress, they suddenly turned left and rushed inside. Without spilling a drop of blood, the Imperial troops herded the baffled Spanish garrison out of the fortifications and occupied the place. Among other key points, the French also grabbed San Sebastián, Pamplona and Figueres.Rickard (2008), Capture of Barcelona On 2 May 1808, the infuriated Spanish people rose in rebellion against their French occupiers.Gates (2002), 12 A 12,710-man Franco-Italian corps commanded by General of Division Guillaume Philibert Duhesme guarded Barcelona in June 1808. General of Division Joseph Chabran's 1st Division consisted of 6,050 soldiers in eight battalions, while Lechi's 2nd Division had 4,600 men in six battalions. Generals of Brigade Bertrand Bessières and François Xavier de Schwarz led 1,700 cavalrymen in nine squadrons, and there were 360 artillerists.Gates (2002), 482 The French authorities in Madrid confidently expected that Duhesme's corps would quickly stamp out the rebellion in Catalonia, but they grossly underestimated its seriousness. The miquelets, the Catalan militia, turned out in large numbers to harass their enemies. In June, Schwarz and Chabran were beaten at the Battles of the Bruch and Duhesme was turned back at the Battle of Girona.Gates (2002), 59-61 Finally awakening to reality, Napoleon ordered General of Division Honoré Charles Reille and a division of reinforcements to Duhesme's assistance. The troops were of low quality and scattered throughout southern France, but Reille quickly cobbled together a fraction of this force and successfully relieved the French garrison of Figueres. Joined by more of his division, he next marched on the port of Roses.Gates (2002), 61 First attack on Roses Honoré Charles Reille Reille commanded 4,000 men and two cannons. These troops included two battalions of the 113th Line Infantry Regiment, 560 men of the Pyrenées Orientales Garde Nationale, two companies of the 2nd Swiss Infantry Regiment, 700 gendarmes and department reserves, and various march battalions and conscript drafts. Roses was held by about 800 men of the Fija de Roses regiment and 400 miquelets, the Catalan militia, with 5,000 more miquelets under Colonel Juan Clarós in the nearby hills. The defenders were given a boost when the British warship (74), under Captain Robert Otway, appeared off the port and landed her marines to help. Reille launched an attack on 11 July 1808, but his troops were driven off with 200 casualties. Spanish losses were light.Smith (1998), 262 Thwarted at Roses, Reille moved in the direction of Girona. When he reached there, he joined with Duhesme to initiate the Siege of Girona. Meanwhile, 5,000 Spanish regular troops from the Balearic Islands commanded by the Marquis Del Palacio landed at Tarragona. Appointed Captain General of Catalonia, Del Palacio joined his regulars with a large mass of Catalan irregulars to start a blockade of Barcelona on 1 August 1808. Lechi's 3,500-man Italo-Swiss garrison defended the city. Among a large population that threatened to revolt at any moment, Lechi began sending alarming reports to Duhesme after being compelled to abandon his outposts, such as the castle of Mongat.Rickard, Siege of Barcelona Even though Duhesme mustered 13,000 soldiers for the siege operation, it ended in failure after starting on 24 July and dragging on until 16 August. When his siege lines were attacked from the rear by a force under the Conde de Caldagues, Duhesme gave up and ordered a withdrawal. He buried his heavy siege cannons, burned his supplies, and headed back to Barcelona while Reille fell back to Figueres. While marching along the coast road Duhesme's marching columns were bombarded by the British frigate (38) commanded by Captain Thomas Cochrane. Faced with this threat and the miquelets' road demolitions, the French veered away from the vulnerable coast highway. After throwing eight field guns into the sea and leaving behind their baggage train, Duhesme's men struck out into the mountains and finally reached Barcelona on 20 August.Smith (1998), 265-266 One source described the Imperial column as \\"a starving, demoralized mob\\" by the time it arrived. In October, Napoleon appointed General of Division Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr and a new corps to relieve Barcelona.Gates (2002), 62 Opposing forces Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr The newly activated VII Corps was made up of six infantry divisions and three cavalry brigades. Chabran's 1st Division, Lechi's 2nd Division, and the mounted brigades of Bessières and Schwarz were cooped up inside Barcelona with Duhesme. With Gouvion Saint-Cyr were Reille's 3rd Division of 12 battalions, General of Division Joseph Souham's 4th Division of 10 battalions, General of Division Domenico Pino's 5th Division of 13 battalions, Louis François Jean Chabot's 6th Division of three battalions, and General of Brigade Jacques Fontane's cavalry brigade of one dragoon and one light cavalry regiment. There was also one unattached dragoon regiment. Including Duhesme's stranded troops, the VII Corps counted 42,380 soldiers.Gates (2002), 486 To build up this force, Napoleon had to shift troops from Italy to Spain. On 28 October the siege artillery finally arrived at the frontier.Rickard, Siege of Rosas Bottled up in Barcelona, Duhesme's 10,000 remaining troops were in a vulnerable situation, but Del Palacio did not press operations with vigor. Instead, he ordered Caldagues to hold a line long with 2,000 regulars and 4,000 to 5,000 miquelets while remaining at Tarragona, far from the action. Duhesme periodically sent out strong columns to strip the countryside of food and supplies for his soldiers. On 12 October, a column was roughly handled and the excursions finally stopped. Finally, on 28 October, the Catalan Junta replaced Del Palacio with Captain General Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu. The new commander was a veteran of the War of the Pyrenees, having commanded the Spanish left wing at the Battle of Boulou in 1794.Prats (2007), Boulou De Vives attacked the French outpost line on 6 November. After this, the Spanish remained quiescent until 26 November when de Vives' offensive forced the French to take refuge behind the walls of Barcelona. In the fall of 1808, the 20,031 men of the Army of Catalonia were organized into a vanguard, four divisions, and a reserve. Brigadier General Mariano Álvarez de Castro led the Vanguard with 5,500 infantry in 10 battalions and 100 cavalry in one squadron. Mariscal de Campo Caldagues commanded the 1st Division with 4,528 foot soldiers in seven battalions, 400 horsemen in four squadrons, and six guns served by 70 artillerists. Mariscal de Campo Gregorio Laguna directed the 2nd Division with 2,076 soldiers in five battalions, 200 cavalry in two squadrons, and seven artillery pieces served by 84 gunners. Colonel Gaspar Gomez de la Serna led the 3rd Division with 2,458 men in five battalions and Colonel Francisco Milans del Bosch commanded the 4th Division with 3,710 troops in four battalions. There was also a reserve of 777 infantry, 80 cavalry, and 48 artillerists serving four guns.Gates (2002), 484Nafziger, Army of Cataluna Siege Thomas Cochrane Gouvion Saint-Cyr's field force numbered 23,000 men. He appointed Reille to manage the siege while he and the rest of the corps stood by to fend off any relief attempts. Reille had 12,000 Imperial troops in 24 battalions supported by four foot artillery batteries. For the siege, the French general employed his own and Pino's divisions. Reille's 3rd Division included one battalion each of the 16th Line, 32nd Light, 56th Line, and 113th Line Infantry Regiments, four battalions of the Regiment of Perpignan, and the Valais, Chasseurs des Montagnes, and 5th Reserve Legion Battalions. Pino's 5th Division was made up of three battalions each of the Italian 1st Light, 2nd Light, and 6th Line Infantry Regiments, two battalions of the Italian 4th Line Infantry Regiment, and one battalion each of the Italian 5th and 7th Line Infantry Regiments.Smith (1998), 271-272 The garrison of Roses consisted of 3,500 soldiers and 58 cannons commanded by Colonel Peter O'Daly. The small core of regulars was represented by 150 men of the Ultonia Infantry Regiment, one company of the Wimpffen Swiss Regiment, a half-battalion of the 2nd Light Infantry of Barcelona, and 120 artillerists. Later in the siege, one weak battalion of the Borbon Infantry Regiment was landed. The remainder of the garrison was made up of the Berga, Figueras, Igualada, and Lérida Tercios, which were formations of miquelets. Providing naval support was the British third-rate (74), Captain John West. As the siege progressed Excellent was replaced by (74), Captain Richard Bennett. Also present were two bomb vessels, and . Cochrane's Imperieuse arrived later in the siege. Portal del Mar (Sea Gate), Fortress of Roses The port of Roses was provided with a Vauban-type citadel (Ciutadella de Roses) and the satellite Castell de la Trinitat. In 1543 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor ordered these fortifications to be built. The works were completed by 1570 and were besieged in 1645, 1693, and 1794–1795. The citadel was a modified pentagon with five bastions. Four demi-lunes covered all sides except the sea side. The Castillo de la Trinidad was an outlying 4-pointed star fort on a high elevation.Goode (2010), Roses The citadel is located just west of Roses while the castillo tops a headland about two kilometers south-southeast of the citadel along a tightly curved promontory. A high height overlooks the Castillo on the northeast.Ostermann-Chandler (1987), 415 map On 8 November a thick fog settled on the land and a force of miquelets took the opportunity to attack Gouvion Saint-Cyr's corps while O'Daly's garrison moved against Reille's encampment. Neither action stopped the siege operation. That day, all civilians were evacuated from the town by sea. After a week of heavy rain, Reille attacked the Castillo de la Trinidad but was repulsed. The heavy guns reached Roses on 16 November and Reille's men soon dug emplacements for them, the rain having stopped. Though he had plenty of soldiers available, de Vives declined to mount a relief expedition. Álvarez tried to march to the assistance of Roses from Girona, but he was stopped at the Fluvià River. The Italians successfully stormed into the town on 26 November.Gates (2002), 64 This allowed Reille to construct a water-front battery which threatened the British warships. Around this time, O'Daly was reinforced by one battalion of regulars. On the 28th, Reille summoned the fortress to surrender, but O'Daly refused. Cochrane arrived and assumed command of the Castillo which was held by Spaniards and sailors from the British squadron. On 30 November, Pino's men tried to storm the Castillo without success. After this repulse, Reille ignored the position and concentrated on reducing the citadel. The French bombardment soon smashed a breach in the fortress walls. On 3 December, the Spanish commander sent 500 men to seize the most deadly of the breaching batteries. This assault failed with heavy losses and the attackers returned to their positions in disarray. On the 4th, Reille's trenches were from the walls and his troops began making preparations to mount a full-dress assault. O'Daly thereupon surrendered unconditionally and on 5 December, 2,366 Spanish soldiers laid down their arms. During the siege, the Spanish suffered about 700 additional casualties. At noon on the day of the capitulation, after the Catalan and Spanish colours were lowered, Cochrane abandoned the castle, destroying its landward bastion and tower with gunpowder from the Imperieuse, and embarked its 180 defenders. Heavy artillery fire prevented the British squadron from rescuing the rest of the garrison. The Franco-Italians lost about 1,000 killed, wounded, and died of disease. Results Having lost an entire month in reducing Roses, it was imperative that the Imperial corps get through to Duhesme, whose supply situation was becoming critical. There were two roads that Gouvion Saint-Cyr might use to reach Barcelona. The coastal road was blocked and was within range of Cochrane's squadron. The defiant defenders of Girona stood in the path of the inland road. Hoping to convince de Vives that he wanted to besiege Girona, the French general arrived in front of that city with 15,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry. Sending back his artillery and baggage train, Gouvion Saint-Cyr led his troops into the mountains the next day. Cutting his way through a force of miquelets on the 12th, his column bypassed Girona and reached the inland highway at Sant Celoni on the 15th. This set the stage for the showdown Battle of Cardadeu on 16 December 1808.Rickard (2008), Battle of Cardadeu NotesReferences   Battles of the Peninsular War Sieges of the Napoleonic Wars Sieges involving Spain Sieges involving France Sieges involving the United Kingdom Sieges involving Italy Battles in Catalonia Conflicts in 1808 1808 in Spain November 1808 events December 1808 events ","title":"Siege of Roses (1808)"},{"id":"36085724","text":"Giovanni Lucantoni (Rieti, 18 January 1825 – Paris, 30 May 1902) was an Italian composer active as a music teacher in Paris.The heritage encyclopedia of band music: composers and their music: Volume 1 William H.

Between 1911 and 1914, Morel managed a mechanic workshop that repaired and sold automobiles and represented the brands Berliet and Le Zèbre. During World War I, he was deemed unfit for combat and was sent to work in a munitions factory. After the war, on 1 April 1919, Morel was hired as a commercial inspector by Le Zèbre. Soon, Amilcar was created by André Morel, Edmond Moyet, Emile Akar and Joseph Lamy. The name \\"Amilcar\\" was formally registered on 29 July 1921 and was loosely based on an anagram, using letters (adjusted to replace the \\"k\\" and the \\"y\\") from the names of two of the company's founders, Lamy and Akar. As the Amilcar business grew, Morel began his great racing career. He won many races, including the French Constructor Championship in 1922. Later, on 26 August 1928 at Arpajon, speed records were officially broken: the 1270 cc was recorded achieving 211 km/h under harsh wet conditions, and the 1100cc (car) at 207 km/h. Andre Morel raced with Delage in 1925 with Albert Divo and won the San Sebastián Grand Prix. March 1929 ended Amilcar's race era. Shortly afterwards, André Morel left Amilcar. While he was racing for Amilcar, Morel was also racing for Voisin. The two companies never competed against one another. Then, Morel met back up with Lamy, and in April 1929, Morel was named representative for the Hudson and Essex brands. Driving an Essex, Morel won the automobile Tour de France. Later Morel raced with Talbot, his last race being at Le Mans in 1952. Near the end of his life, Morel was elected the vice president of the Racers Society. On 3 August 1961 André Morel died in the suburbs of Lyon, due to some illness. The most comprehensive historical work on André Morel has been compiled by Philip Schram and is published at www.lezebre.eu. A DVD was published that includes the Le Zebre portion of André Morel's resume.

A bulbous perennial, it is grown for its blue grape-hyacinth like flowers, blooming in late spring, much later than the more popular Siberian squill and later than Muscari which it resembles. Originating in the western Balkans (hence Dalmatian scilla), it was introduced to western Europe (England) in 1827. It has become much more easily available since 2004.Paghat's garden In its original habitat in Slovenia it is considered an endangered species,IUCN Red List flowering in May–June.Zaplana.net  Description  Scilla litardierei has 3-6 grass-like leaves, 3-8mm wide, tapering to a point. Up to 70 blue- violet flower buds are borne on each stem in a dense raceme, opening into star-shaped flowers, 15–20 cm high. Preferring partial shade, it will naturalise and spread in favourable conditions.  Taxonomy  To quote Stedje (2001): \\"The definition of genera and the assignment of species to genera within the family Hyacinthaceae or subfamily Scilleae of the family Liliaceae, have troubled taxonomists since Linnaeus. The group is poor in qualitative characters, which has made it difficult to define stable genera based on good diagnostic characters. Species have often been moved from genus to genus either due to different opinions on generic delimitation or to misinterpretation of characters.\\" Based on DNA sequence studies, the Austrian botanist Franz Speta prefers to re-ascribe this species into a separate genus, Chouardia, within the Hyacintheae.Speta, F. (1998): Systematische Analyse der Gattung Scilla L. s. l. (Hyacinthaceae). Phyton (Horn Austria) 38(1), 97–99. The preferred name is Scilla litardierei.Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew: World Checklist The synonyms Scilla amethystina Fish., Scilla pratensis Waldst. & Kit., Scilla italica Host and Scilla nutans Alsch. are no longer valid.

He had a brother and two sisters. While still a boy, he was taught shoe repair by his father, who had come from a long line of shoemakers from De Bilt in the Netherlands. De Ruiter claims to have experienced a spontaneous state of awakening, at the age of 17. It lasted a year, then left him equally abruptly. Following this experience, de Ruiter spent years in the investigation of mystical and philosophical traditions in an attempt to regain that which he had lost. He concluded that no existing system, religious dogma or technique provided the means to fill the void felt by him. According to de Ruiter's account, only unconditional surrender returned him to the state of awakening. He founded the College of Integrated Philosophy in 2005 in Edmonton. Here he holds weekly meetings when not traveling.  Teachings  De Ruiter rarely addresses the whole group in public meetings but answers questions on a one-on-one basis with individuals from the audience. He often responds after lengthy pauses, sometimes of half an hour or more. De Ruiter's unusual seminar practices have been the subject of reporting; VICE described his practice as the \\"staring cult.\\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/xd5eqz/inside-a-canadian-staring- cult-224 During these periods of silence, de Ruiter claims to be in a deep state of Samadhi. De Ruiter's teaching style has been compared to oral-based teaching of Tibetan Buddhism where detachment and release are also key principles. Professor Paul Joosee, in his 2009 study of de Ruiter published in the peer-reviewed academic Journal of Contemporary Religion, concluded that de Ruiter's silences can inspire devotion in three ways. First, they may elicit projection. In other words, listeners often interpret silence as understanding. Second, silence sometimes serves as a punitive purpose, as a display of power. Third, combined with the act of gazing into another's eyes, silence can create intimacy of a kind usually exclusive to lovers. Followers may confuse an act that usually accompanies intimacy with actual intimacy and feel a loving devotion to de Ruiter. \\"Okayness\\" is central to de Ruiter's philosophy. It is best understood as \\"loving acceptance\\" that may exist even \\"in moments of intense sorrow or immense physical pain\\". De Ruiter states that \\"Truth lives in each one of us,\\" and that a high level of awareness that can only come from \\"core splitting honesty\\" is required to understand that there is no necessity to search. De Ruiter is said to practice and recommend inner quiet and integrity on all levels of life, from the superficial to the profound. Controversies Controversy concerning the movement arose in 1999 when, in a public meeting, de Ruiter's wife confronted him after learning that he was involved with two daughters of a devotee who had invested into the organisation. The sisters, themselves followers of de Ruiter, would later sue him in court for support.Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta Action no. 1603-0116-AC \\"Von Sass v De Ruiter\\", Edmonton, 07 October 2016. Retrieved on jan 2017. In a sworn affidavit from Benita von Sass in 2013, she alleged that he claimed to be \\"Christ on earth\\" and \\"defying him was to defy truth, goodness and God. Accordingly, I (von Sass) obeyed and submitted.\\" Further controversy has arisen in 2014 after the death of one of de Ruiter's female followers under mysterious circumstances and in 2017, after de Ruiter publicly admitted that he had had sex with a number of his female followers. He has referred to this as the Calling. Jasun Horsley's 2017 book Dark Oasis: A Self- Made Messiah Unveiled examines de Ruiter's life and teachings in critical and skeptical terms.

He was the son of Jacques-Jean Barre who preceded him as the Chief Engraver.Désiré-Albert Barre, Graveurs Généraux et particuliers des Monnaies de France, Contrôleurs Généraux des Effigies, Noms de quelques graveurs en Médailles de la Renaissance Française, Paris, 1867. His brother Jean-Auguste Barre, a French sculptor and medalist, succeeded him as Chief Engraver after his death in Paris. Early life Attracted to painting, Barre joined the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in 1838 and became a pupil of Paul Delaroche. His interest in ancient art led him to take several trips to Italy. He exhibited biblical themes at the Paris Salon from 1843 to 1851. He received a third- class medal at the Salon in 1846. He painted the frescoes in the chapel of Saint-Eustache, Paris. Having failed to finish the frescoes he had begun in the chapel of the Holy Innocents in the same church, they were by the Paul- Dominique Gourlier in 1855. His career changed when his father, Jacques-Jean Barre, asked him to assist him at the mint in 1845. Became his father's closest collaborator, so much so that it becomes difficult to distinguish their respective contributions, especially for the early French stamp projects dating from 1848. Chief Engraver Napoleon III stamp designed by Barre In February 1855, he succeeded his father, to the post of Chief Engraver of the Paris Mint. He wrote Graveurs Généraux et particuliers des Monnaies de France', Contrôleurs Généraux des Effigies, Noms de quelques graveurs en Médailles de la Renaissance Française, published in 1867. In 1855, he resumed the work of his father, including engravings for French postage stamps. Barre, unlike his father, did not work well with Anatole Hulot the contractor responsible for printing the stamps. Hulot was an expert at electroplating, and utilized that technique to make the printing plates for the stamps. To compete with this technique for the reproduction of images on the printing plates, Barre embarked on striking tests with coining presses between 1858 and 1859. He produced, on the order of the Committee on Coins, test types of the Ceres stamp. In the end, Hulot retained the contract by lowering his prices. In 1861, thanks to the delay of Hulot, the technique of using the coin press, however, allowed Barre to take the contract to produce printing plates of the first postage stamps of Greece.Louis Fanchini, \\"The essays \\"Cérès 1858\\": Why are they an integral part of the Greek philately?\\", Philotelia n° 652/653 & 654 of September/October, November/December 2008 & January/February 2009, pages 260–270, 364–374 & 7–16. Barre had designed the drawing and the dies for the new Hermes type, a few months prior. In 1876,Louis Fanchini, The Ernest Meyer's imprints on the large Hermes head of Greece and on the Cérès of France, Opus number 13 of 2013, pages 69–84. he provided the same work for the creation of two additional stamps.Louis Fanchini, Large Hermes heads Paris printing: The exact quantities ordered and shipped to Athens\\", Philotelia n° 646 of September/October 2007, pages 277–286. The strained relationship between Barre and Hulot caused delays in the production of new stamps in the early 1860s. In disagreement with Hulot's work, Barre delayed the delivery of the dies of the new laurel effigies of Napoleon III stamps which had been designed in early 1861. On two occasions for the new denomination, Hulot returned the die damaged to Barre for retouching. In August 1866, although he has made the model in July, Barre refused to engrave the die of the new five francs stamp. Hulot has to make do with copies of old dies.Jean-François Brun (editor), Le Patrimoine du timbre-poste français, Flohic éditions, 1998, , page 75.

Beria claimed they formed the \\"more angry part of the prisoners\\" and that they \\"performed defeatist agitation and attempted to organize escapes with the aim of renewing underground activities\\". The list was sent to Stalin, who approved it.

It was founded as the Lebanon Hospital by Jonas Weil in 1890. In 1962, Lebanon Hospital merged with Bronx Hospital, and since 2016 the combined center has served a teaching hospital for Mount Sinai School of Medicine.  History  Lebanon Hospital, 1893 The current hospital center owes its origins to the immigration of European Jews in the late 19th century that caused an even greater strain on the area's hospitals. Jonas Weil, after a poor experience in trying to obtain treatment for a friend decided to look for a solution to this problem. The first step in this process was the creation of the Lebanon Hospital Association via his own donation of $10,175. Further monies followed from others, and the Lebanon Hospital was chartered in 1890 and opened in 1893 at the corner of Westchester Avenue and 151st Street. A nursing school was added in 1894, and several expansions followed that coincided with continued population growth in the region. Finally, Lebanon Hospital moved to a newer building on Grand Concourse at Mount Eden Parkway in 1946. The Bronx Hospital, meanwhile, was founded in 1911 to meet the healthcare needs of the growing South Bronx community and was caring for more than 30,000 patients per year within its first seven years of operation. The operational team of the new hospital purchased the Eichler estate on Fulton Avenue and turned the home into a 110-bed hospital. Within an additional seven years, the local population grew further, necessitating a 310-bed hospital. By the time the 1950s had drawn to a close, the two hospital boards shared staff and resources in order to best serve the needs of the Bronx's still-growing population and the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center was created in 1962. The current center consists of two major facilities: one based on the original Lebanon Hospital Grand Concourse site, a 17-story tower that provides medical, specialty, outpatient and emergency services; and one on Bronx Hospital's Fulton site, now a psychiatric and substance abuse program and a 240-bed skilled nursing facility. The hospital's promise is that it does not turn anyone away although it has come under scrutiny recently due to its billing practices that left some patients facing large bills.  2017 attack  At approximately 3 p.m. on June 30, 2017, gunman Dr. Henry William Bello, a doctor who left Bronx- Lebanon after sexual harassment complaints, entered the building with an AR-15 rifle concealed under a lab coat. He attempted to locate a female target, then shot other medical staff. Approximately one hour later police found him dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

On November 5, 2018, he was elected new member of El Colegio Nacional (The National College), a Mexican honorary academy that brings together the country's forty foremost artists and scientists. Research, fieldwork and museum exhibitions His research has focused primarily on the religion, politics, and art of pre- Hispanic societies in Central Mexico. His scholarship has contributed to our knowledge of indigenous strategies of recovering the distant past, the coded language of buried offerings, the functions and symbolism of sacred architecture, the uses and meanings of Mexica sculpture, the application of materials science to the study of pre-Hispanic art and artifacts, iconoclastic activities in times of crisis, mother goddess cults, and sacrificial practices, among other areas. He has also ventured into the history of Mexican archaeology, achieving significant advances in the study of its origins in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. López Luján began working in archeological, anthropological, and historical projects when he was eight years old. He has participated in various scientific teams in the Mexican federal entities of Campeche, Chiapas, Distrito Federal, Guanajuato, Estado de México, Morelos, and Quintana Roo, and in Ecuador. The year 1980 was especially significant in his career, for he began working at INAH's Templo Mayor Project in the first (1978–1982) and second (1987) seasons of excavations in Tenochtitlan's sacred precinct under the direction of Eduardo Matos Moctezuma. Eleven years later, in 1991, he became the director of the project and currently occupies this position. In this way, he has led the fourth (1991–1992), fifth (1994–1997), sixth (2004–2006), seventh (2007–2014), eighth (2014–2018), and ninth (2018- ) archaeological field seasons.

The emotion, fear, has been hard-wired into almost every individual, due to its vital role in the survival of the individual. Researchers have found that fear is established unconsciously and that the amygdala is involved with fear conditioning. By understanding how fear is developed within individuals, it may be possible to treat human mental disorders such as anxiety, phobia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Neuronal fear pathways In fear conditioning, the main circuits that are involved are the sensory areas that process the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, certain regions of the amygdala that undergo plasticity (or long-term potentiation) during learning, and the regions that bear an effect on the expression of specific conditioned responses. These pathways converge in the lateral amygdala. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic plasticity that enhances the response of lateral amygdala neurons to the conditioned stimulus occurs in the lateral amygdala. As a result, the conditioned stimulus is then able to flow from the lateral amygdala to the central nucleus of the amygdala. The basal and intercalated masses of the amygdala connect the lateral amygdala with the central nucleus of the amygdala directly and indirectly. Pathways from central nucleus of the amygdala to downstream areas then control defensive behavior (freezing) and autonomic and endocrine responses. Recent studies implicate the prelimbic cortex in fear expression as well, possibly by way of its connections to the basal and then to the central nucleus of the amygdala. Behavioral basis It has been observed that fear can contribute to behavioral changes. One way this phenomenon has been studied is on the basis of the repeated stress model done by Camp RM et al.(among others). In this particular study, it was examined that the contribution fear conditioning may play a huge role in altering an animal's (Fischer rat's) behavior in a repeated stress paradigm. Behavioral changes that are commonly referred to as depressive-like behaviors resulted from this model of testing. After setting a control and a valid experimental design, Fischer rats were exposed daily to different stressors in a complex environment. After four days of stressor exposure, both exploratory behavior and social interaction were tested on day 5 in either the same environment or a new environment. The rats showed much decreased exploration and social interaction when tested in different contexts compared to control rats. To further make a correlation to the biochemistry (as mentioned below), chronic infusion of propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist) prevented the behavioral changes following repeated stressor exposure thus halting long term potentiation. Some physiological changes also occurred including the decrease in body weight gain and adrenal hypertrophy observed in animals exposed to stress. Overall, the conditioned fear responses can contribute to behavioral changes in a repeated stress paradigm. This can be extended to correlate to other animals as well but with varying degrees of responses. Molecular basis Molecular mechanisms that have been linked directly to the behavioral expression of conditioning are easier to study in a clinical setting as opposed to mechanisms that underlie long-term potentiation (LTP), in which synaptic plasticity is induced by electrical or chemical stimulation of lateral amygdala circuits. LTP is important for fear processing because it strengthens the synapses in neural circuits. These strengthened synapses are how long-term memory is developed and how fear is developed. Hebbian synaptic plasticity Synaptic input can be strengthened when activity in the presynaptic neuron co-occurs with depolarization in the postsynaptic neuron. This is known as Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This hypothesis is especially appealing as an explanation for how simple associative learning, such as that taking place in fear conditioning, might occur. In this model of fear conditioning, strong depolarization of the lateral amygdala elicited by the stimulus leads to the strengthening of temporally and spatially relative conditioned stimulus inputs (that are coactive) onto the same neurons. Experimental data has been shown to support the idea that the plasticity and fear memory formation in the lateral amygdala are triggered by unconditioned stimulus-induced activation of the region's neurons. Thus, unconditioned stimulus-evoked depolarization is necessary for the enhancement of conditioned stimulus-elicited neural responses in this region after conditioned-unconditioned pairing and pairing a conditioned stimulus with direct depolarization of the lateral amygdala's pyramidal neurons as an unconditioned stimulus supports fear conditioning. It is also clear that synaptic plasticity at conditioned stimulus input pathways to the lateral amygdala does occur with fear conditioning. =NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors= Hebbian plasticity is believed to involve N-methyl-d- aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and are located on postsynaptic neurons in the lateral amygdala. NMDARs are known to be coincidence detectors of presynaptic activity and postsynaptic depolarization. Auditory inputs are NMDARs in the lateral amygdala and use glutamate as a transmitter. Furthermore, it was tested that when the region's neurons that received auditory inputs also received unconditioned stimulus inputs and broad spectrum NMDAR antagonists in the lateral amygdala resulted in the disruption of the acquisition of fear learning. Therefore, these receptors are crucial to the metabolic pathway of processing and eliciting for the percept of fear. =Monoamine neuromodulatory-dependent mechanisms= It is believed that monoamine transmitters such as norepinepherine and dopamine that are released in emotional situations function in regulating glutamatergic transmission and Hebbian plasticity. The modulation of all of the different types of plasticity is called heterosynaptic plasticity. Homosynaptic plasticity is also prevalent which consists solely of the Hebbian plasticity. In a variety of model systems, it has been shown that monoamines modulate plasticity underlying memory formation such as a heightened percept of fear. Neuromodulators also contribute to fear conditioning. The Hebbian mechanisms contribute to plasticity in the lateral amygdala and fear learning. Other modulators apart from the Hebbian mechanisms include serotonin, acetylcholine, endocannabinoids, and various peptides (such as gastrin-releasing peptide, NPY, opiates, and oxytocin) but the role of these compounds are not fully understood. Norepinephrine Norepinephrine is a huge player in fear memory formation. Recent studies have demonstrated that the blockade of norepinephrine β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala interferes with the acquisition of fear learning when given pretraining stimuli but has no effect when applied posttraining or before memory retrieval. In contrast to effects of β-AR receptor blockade on other forms of learning, this effect is specific to only acquisition, as opposed to the posttraining processing or expression of fear memory. The activation of β-ARs in the lateral amygdala synergistically regulates Hebbian processes to trigger the neuron's associative plasticity and fear learning in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. One theory suggests that the mechanism of β-AR involvement in the acquisition of fear learning is that they act on GABAergic interneurons to suppress feed-forward inhibition and enhance Hebbian plasticity. β-ARs are found on GABAergic interneurons as well as in the lateral amygdala's pyramidal cells. The process of activation of β-ARs start off by coupling to G protein signaling cascades, which then activate protein kinase A (PKA). This activation can elicits the phosphorylation of NMDARs as well as the ser845 site on GluA1, which could facilitate AMPAR insertion at the synapse. Dopamine Dopamine receptor activation (both D1 and D2 receptor subtypes) in the amygdala contributes to the acquisition of fear conditioning. D1 and D2 receptors are G protein coupled and inhibit adenylate cyclase (Gi-coupled) and stimulate adenylate cyclase (Gs-coupled), respectively. Just like β-ARs, dopamine receptors may modulate Hebbian processes directly by reducing feed-forward inhibition. They may also act in a parallel fashion with Hebbian mechanisms to implement synapses in the lateral amygdala and promote plasticity and fear learning through their respective signaling pathways. =Metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated neuromodulation during= Plasticity and learning can also be modulated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The proteins mGluRs likely serve a modulatory function and do not participate directly in Hebbian processes. This is because due to the fact these receptors do not contribute to depolarization during synapses. They are also not activated by receptors that participate in Hebbian processes. Finally, they do not detect pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. However, the activation of group I mGluRs in the lateral amygdala and basal nucleus enhances the acquisition, reduction, and amplification of fear conditioning by providing an influx of calcium ions. Fear circuitry=Fear recognition Research studies have shown that damage to the bilateral amygdala affects mostly the recognition of fear. In a specific study conducted by Andrew J. Calder and Andrew W. Young, they had subjects classify morphed images of facial expressions ranging from happiness to surprise to fear to sadness to disgust to anger. While control subjects classified these images to the nearest expression, subjects who had damage to the bilateral amygdala had problems with this task, especially with the recognition of facial expressions that show fear. The subjects with the damaged bilateral amygdala had no problems differentiating happiness from sadness, but they could not differentiate the expression of anger from fear. However, in an experiment conducted by Ralph Adolphs, it elucidated the mechanism of the impaired fear recognition. Adolphs found that his main subject, who had a rare bilateral amygdala damage, could not discern fear expressions because of her inability to look at the eye region of the face. When the subject was instructed to look directly at the eye region of faces with expression, the subject could recognize fear expressions of faces. Although the amygdala does play an important part in the recognition of fear, further research shows that there are alternate pathways that are capable to support fear learning in the absence of a functional amygdala. A study by Kazama also shows that although the amygdala may be damaged, it is still possible for patients to distinguish the difference between safety cues and fear. Conditioned stimuli There has been a substantial amount of research done on conditioned stimuli, where a neutral stimulus, such as a flash of light, is paired with a shock is given to a rat. The result of this conditioned stimulus is to provoke the unconditioned response, fear. The once neutral stimulus is given again to see if the rat would show the responses of fear. However, because fear responses involve many behaviors, it is important to see which behaviors are exhibited when the conditioned stimulus is given. Visual and auditory stimuli Initially, the visual stimuli is first received by the visual thalamus and relayed to the amygdala for potential danger. The visual thalamus also relays the information to the visual cortex and is processed to see if the stimuli poses a potential threat. If so, this information is relayed to the amygdala and the muscle contraction, increased heart rate and blood pressure begins, thus activating the sympathetic neuronal pathway. A presentation of a neutral visual stimuli has been shown to intensify the percept of fear or suspense induced by a different channel of information, such as audition. From Le Doux's research, it shows that sound stimuli are not directly relayed from the auditory thalamus to the central nucleus. Perception The perception of fear is elicited by many different stimuli and involves the process described above in biochemical terms. Neural correlates of the interaction between language and visual information has been studied by Roel Willems et al.Willems lab The study consisted of observing how visual and linguistic information interact in the perception of emotion. A common phenomenon from film theory was borrowed which states that the presentation of a neutral visual scene intensifies the percept of fear or suspense induced by a different channel of information, such as language. This principle has been applied in a way in which the percept of fear was present and amplified in the presence of a neutral visual stimuli. The main idea is that the visual stimuli intensify the fearful content of the stimuli (i.e. language) by subtly implying and concretizing what is described in the context (i.e. sentence). Activation levels in the right anterior temporal pole were selectively increased and is believed to serve as a binding function of emotional information across domains such as visual and linguistic information. Exposure to different types of emotion and levels of arousal also appear to influence pain through an interaction known as the valence-by-arousal interaction. During this reaction, negative emotions experienced by an individual with low levels of arousal tend to cause enhanced pain while negative valenced emotions with higher levels of arousal have been observed to decrease the perception of pain. Low levels of arousal would include reactive emotions such as anxiety while higher levels of arousal include emotions such as fear.Rhudy, JL.

The design of the entrance has to seal the access to the cultic structure in such a way that it is possible to gain access to the interior again, even after a long time, in order to perform rituals. To that end, the practitioners of Nordic megalith architecture, the Wartberg culture and Horgen culture, used several variants, that are also found in other megalithic regions in identical or slightly modified form. As the solutions were refined in detail, they all had in common the aim of sealing the structure that its re-opening was possible under difficult but manageable conditions by the tribal community. In general the following forms of entrance may be differentiated: Simple dolmens (upper image) *1. no entrance *2. entrance on the top *3. half-height entrance sealed with a closure stone *4. full height half-width stone (with passage) Dolmens (except No. 4) *5. squared entrance (eingewinkelter Zugang) *6. additional entrance to the external passage Passage graves (lower image) *7. triangular entrance *8. portal entrance (with lintel) *9. low passage entrance in front of a portal Gallery graves and stone cists *10. round (or similarly shaped) port-holeThe German for this is Seelenloch i.e. \\"spirit hole\\". Variation 7 has its focus in the Swedish Bohuslän (Dolmen of Haga). The stones forming the entrance were so selected or fashioned that together they form a triangular entrance (top left). This special form, which effectively replaces the lintel, is also found in the region of Languedoc-Roussillon, e.g. at the dolmen of Banelle, which lies near Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort in the southern French department of Gard. The portal entrance used a lintel, a horizontal block placed over two lower supporting stones in order to level out the distance to the capstone. This enabled access, usually only by crawling, through a trilithon opening (top centre), and may be seen across the whole area where Nordic megalithic architecture occurs. In portal-like openings in the chamber wall, which, for example, have been made by leaving out a supporting stone, (bottom image: above right and below right), a passage in front of the chamber allows the cross-section of the entrance to be reduced. An example of this type of construction is the Sieben Steinhäuser in Lower Saxony. Such \\"chambers without (detected) passages\\" may be found in the Netherlands and Schleswig- Holstein. The entrance location and size determines, ultimately, whether the structure is a passage grave or a dolmen (J. Ross). In the Netherlands (Drenthe), where this form is very common, structures with no passages are known as portal graves; which otherwise, as portal tombs form a sub-group of megalithic tombs on the British Isles but structurally have nothing in common with the sites in the province of Drenthe. Variation 7 is not dissimilar to the so-called port-hole (bottom left), in which the front stone or, as in the diagram, two front stones are hewn out so as to create a circular access hole. The slabs were made of a material that enabled contemporary methods and tools to be used to fashion them. This version occurs Central Europe at sites built by the Wartberg and Horgen cultures in Baden-Württemberg and Switzerland. Some Swedish so-called megalithic stone cists also have port-holes. In German, such a hole is known as a Seelenloch (\\"soul hole\\"), a name that originated because of the erroneous assumption that holes were created with the intention of releasing the soul of the deceased (in the minds of the builders). In the Bronze and Iron Age sites on Sardinia and the Iberian Peninsula, similar openings are found, that are also narrow, but nearer the ground, and apse- like, (recess-shaped) with embedded closure stones. Another feature of ground- level entrances is a so-called stone sill (Schwellenstein). This separates the secular or profane area of the passage from the sacred burial chamber. In some cases, it also serves to support the closure stone or slab. In some embedded simple dolmens and portal tomb it is so high that it forms a half-height front stone, enabling access above it, and is thus part of the wall of the chamber.

Previously his father Charles Martel failed to conquer the whole region, and left a deep scar by devastating various cities that had failed to support him. While the Gothic magnates did not support the Franks formerly, things were changing this time: Nîmes, Agde and Béziers were handed over to him by the Gothic count Ansemundus. Mauguio surrendered too. Count Miló was at the time ruling in Narbonne as a vassal of the Andalusians, but when Ansemundus handed over several cities to Pepin, Miló did not join, probably deterred by the strong Muslim garrison stationed in the city. Start of the siege The Frankish king Pepin finally lay siege to the Gothic- Andalusian Narbonne in 752 with a view to seizing it with no delay. However, Pepin suffered a major blow when his main local, Gothic ally Ansemundus was killed by a rival Gothic faction during the besieging operations in 754. The death of the count was followed by a revolt in Nîmes that was put down by Pepin, and a Frankish governor imposed. Furthermore, the Aquitanian rival duke Waifer is recorded about this period leading an army of Basques against the Carolingian king on the rearguard of his siege of Narbonne. The Narbonnese garrison and residents were able to withstand Pepin's siege thanks to the supplies provided by sea by the Andalusian navy. Conquest of Narbonne In 759, Narbonne was not receiving reinforcements from Al-Andalus, rife as it was with internal fights. Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri, wali of al-Andalus, had to quash a rebellion in Zaragoza in 756, and immediately head south to fight Abd ar-Rahman I, who defeated him. North-eastern Iberia and the remainder of Septimania was left without any relevant commander in charge. Finally, the defenders of Narbonne surrendered to the Frankish forces after killing the Andalusian garrison and opening the gates of the stronghold to the investing forces of the Carolingian king. Previously, the king Pepin had promised to uphold and respect the Gothic laws and probably their own government, so garnering the allegiance of the Gothic nobility of Septimania.Lewis, Archibald R. 1965 Aftermath After the conquest of Narbonne, the Saracens (Arabs and Berbers) retreated to their Andalusian heartland after 40 years of occupation, and the Carolingian king Pepin came up reinforced. The government of the city was assigned to the Gothic count Miló, who had fled the city five years before when it was besieged, and had retreated to Trausse (Aude). The submission of Septimania allowed the Frankish king to divert his attention to his only opponent, the independent ruler (princeps) of Aquitaine Waifer. In the wake of Narbonne's submission, Pepin took Roussillon, and then directed his effort against Toulouse, Rouergue and Albigeois in Aquitaine leading to the battle for Aquitaine.

Only one species in this genus is currently recognised - Hyaloklossia lieberkuehni. History This parasites of this genus was first observed by Lieberkuhn in 1854 within the renal cortex of a frog of the genus Rana. Labbe in 1894 initially named this species Klossia lieberkuehni. Labbe in 1896 moved this species to a new genus Hyaloklossia. Laveran and Mesnil in 1902 and Minchin in 1903 moved this species into the genus Diplospora Labbe 1893. It was moved again into the genus Isospora by Noller in 1923. The species was replaced in the genus Hyaloklossia by Modry et al. in 2001. Description There are two sporocysts within the ocysts. The oocysts have a thin, elastic, relatively fragile wall. The sporocysts are tetrazoic. The sporocyst wall is composed of plates joined by sutures and Stieda and substieda bodies are absent. The life cycle is homoxenous. Endogenous development is extraintestinal (renal). Sporulation of oocysts is endogenous.  Life cycle  The sporocysts are released from the renal spithelial cells and are passed with the urine into the water. It is presumed that they are subsequently ingested, decyst within the gut, invade the gut wall and migrate to the renal cortex. The parasites grow with the renal epithelial cells and give rise to male and female gamonts which are released into the lumen of the tubule where they meet and fuse forming an oocyte. The oocyte subsequently develops into an oocyst which in turn divides into two sporocysts. Host record The only known host of this species is the European green frog (Rana esculenta).

Biography Diaconescu graduated the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the Polytechnic Institute of Bucharest, then became famous in part due to the TV show he hosted on his own TV channel, promptly referred to as Dan Diaconescu Direct (Dan Diaconescu Live). The show achieved its success peak during 2008-2009, when it regularly broadcast updates regarding the disappearance of Elodia Ghinescu, which he dubbed the \\"Elodia series\\". Trial On 22 June 2010, Diaconescu was arrested by the National Anti- corruption Agency (DNA) for extortion. Diaconescu was accused of having asked a mayor of a commune in Transylvania to take money in exchange for not publishing compromising data. A day later, he was arrested for 29 days, following the District 1 Court's decision. On 25 June, Diaconescu was released after Bucharest Court judges have upheld the decision of detention. \\"I want to tell you that from this moment Dona, my daughter holds OTV and I announce my candidacy for the next presidential elections in 2014 or when are they\\" were the first words spoken by Dan Diaconescu, after he left the arrest. Political activity On 29 November 2010, Diaconescu founded the People's Party, the party idea based on a citizen residing in Cugir. He launched his candidacy for the presidential election in 2014. At the legislative election of 2012, Diaconescu was nominated to run for a deputy term of Gorj in one electoral college against his challenger was then prime minister, Victor Ponta. He lost the election, and missed the entrance to the Parliament on redistribution. Therefore, he announced his retirement from politics.

He was court painter to Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies before working for Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin and becoming involved in the removal and shipping of the Elgin Marbles to England. Biography Eruption on Vesuvius by night, 1793 According to the Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD), Lusieri travelled in Naples, Greece, and Turkey. He was employed by Lord Elgin, to make drawings of the Acropolis.Giovanni Battista Lusieri in the RKD He is known today for removing and shipping the Elgin Marbles to London. Lusieri believed that he might have been more famous as an artist had he not spent so much time working for Lord Elgin and his antiquity collection. He had originally been known for the accurate landscapes and studies of buildings in Italy and Sicily that he often sold to young gentlemen on their Grand Tour, especially after he moved to Naples in 1782 and concentrated on views of Mount Vesuvius. These paintings sold well because the volcano was then quite active. Lord Byron regarded him as an important Italian artist, although he may have been biased as he was also the good friend of Lusieri's brother-in-law, Nicolo Giraud. Lusieri painted his landscapes in accurate detail, and resisted the fashion for imaginative constructions imitating Claude Lorrain, arguing that paintings should be taken from real life. From 1799 he spent his time working for Lord Elgin in Greece, and less time painting. Elgin Marbles Lusieri's scaffolding during deconstruction of the Parthenon Lusieri was employed by Lord and Lady Elgin even though he was not able to speak English. The contract was drawn up between them in French, and Lusieri was to be paid £200 per year. Lusieri had been the Court Painter to the King of Naples and Elgin's secretary, William Hamilton, had written to the King to ask permission to employ his painter. Lusieri was originally employed to create sketches for Elgin of Greek antiquities. Lusieri was empowered to also employ moulders who were to create casts of Greek sculptures. Elgin however found that marble sculptures were missing and that they had allegedly been destroyed. It was Lusieri who persuaded the reluctant Elgin to remove the sculptures in order to protect them from local Turkish opportunists, who were breaking off bits to sell to tourists. In 1801 Elgin had Lusieri supervise the removal of the sculptures at a cost of £70,000.Elgin Marbles in The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, Volume 22, by Reuben Percy & John Timbs, 1833, pg 137, on Google books Legacy Lusieri's body of work was seriously reduced when many of his paintings were lost in a shipwreck in 1828. A considerable number of his extant paintings are in the possession of the Elgin family. These paintings and others were in Lusieri's very first exhibition, at the Scottish National Gallery in 2012.

Dehsmukh and written by Shabdh Kumar. The film was made in the style of formula-based potboilers and was a hit. It stars Rajesh Khanna in the lead role and the supporting cast includes Chunky Pandey, Amrita Singh, Sonu Walia, Avinash Wadhavan, Deepika Chikhalia, Sadashiv Amrapurkar and Kiran Kumar in pivotal roles. It was the 11th highest- grossing film of the year 1991. Rupaye Dus Karod (ten crores of rupees) is the story of a detective novelist (writing in Hindi) - Ravi Varma (Rajesh Khanna), whose father had to flee from India in his childhood because of a conspiracy masterminded by his wicked business partners and later Ravi finds himself in mystery murder and another plot that tried to earn 10 crores by fraudulent means. Plot Chamanlal and Aatmaram were partners with Jamuna Das and Babubhai, but when Atmaram discovers that the core business is selling women abroad for prostitution, he breaks away from this partnership and tells the wife of Chamanlal. Chamanlal's wife confronts him, but Chamanlal is steadfast and decides not to leave the business. In an extreme reaction, his wife leaves the house along with her son and clothes to start a living on her own. Chamanlal keeps thinking about this matter and decides to meet his other two partners to convey that he feels this business is unethical, that he cares for his family's sentiments more and asks for his final share before parting ways. But because of a conspiracy masterminded by his wicked business partners (Kiran Kumar and Sadashiv Amrapurkar), Chamanlal presumes he killed Babubhai (Kiran Kumar) and the prime witness to this supposed murder - Vakil Jamuna Das (Sadashiv Amarpurkar), asks Chamanlal to flee, but at the same time informs the police to search for him. Chamanlal searches for his wife and son, but cannot locate them and so he informs Atmaram that now he has reformed and that he needs to search for his son and wife who have left him. He also tells Atmaram that he is innocent and wants to escape. Meanwhile, after reading in newspapers about police searching for Chamanlal and that Chamanalal has died in an accident, his wife considers herself a widower and brings up her only child by tailoring. 20 years later, Vakil Jamuna Das comes to know that Chamanlal is alive, has made it big in Singapore, has made investments abroad and plans to transfer them to his wife and son, after searching for them extensively in India. Chamanlal decides to transfer 10 crores to RBI in such an arrangement that only his own family members will get an access to the fund. Brought up by his mother, Ravi (Rajesh Khanna) obtains a law degree and becomes a very successful famous criminal lawyer. But after few years, he stops and instead writes Hindi novels of the crime detective genre. His novels achieve popularity within a few years. Aarthi Saxena has huge crush on Ravi Varma all because of his suspense novels. Aarthi is naive and keeps thinking that all crime cases can be solved in the manner in which Ravi Verma's novels move forward. Ravi Verma's face was never disclosed to the public in the last few years since his novels hit the stores. A media conference is arranged in which his face would be disclosed and a function is arranged where the chief guest is DIG Sharma (Satyendra Kapoor). In fact, at this function she meets Ravi for the very first time with a toy gun in her hands and shocks the people gathered around Ravi Verma, saying she would kill him if she does not do what she wants. Then she later discloses that she did this only to get an autograph from him. Media and public are shocked to know that famous Lawyer Ravi Verma is the one who writes suspense novels as well. Later, Aarthi becomes friends with Ravi, takes him to their home and introduces him to her father Aatmaram and her brother Vicky (Avinash Wadhavan). There, Ravi comes to know that Vicky and his father do not get along well as they keep fighting over Vicky's money spending habits. Chamanlal's ex-business partners are interested in usurping this huge sum of 10 crores. They are well aware of the talent of Ravi Varma and therefore, they hire his services to draw a scheme so that this money could be usurped by them. For compelling him to do this job for them, they kidnap his mother and threaten to kill her, not knowing that both Ravi and his mother are related to Chamanlal. Ravi agrees to work for them, but at the same time devises a scheme such that he saves his mother and ensures that the money does not get into the hands of the unscrupulous people. First, he decides to appoint a trusted friend, who is looking for a job, as his secretary (Deepika Chikhalia). Ravi's first target is following the life of the son of Babubhai – Suraj (Chunky Pandey) - who keeps on chasing skirts and fooling girls, saying he loves them. Suraj keeps a bet with his friends (Paintal and others) that he will make Poonam (Sonu Walia), a club dancer, fall in love with them. He makes Poonam trust her and acts as if he is in love with her. Ravi asks Babubhai, as a part of his plan, to not give pocket expenses to his son Suraj. Later, Ravi ensures Suraj becomes aware of a plan where Suraj can earn 10 crores if Suraj works for a client of Ravi, the Queen of Hastinapur (Deepika Chikalia). Suraj jumps on this offer and agrees to go as per the plan made by Ravi. Meanwhile, Ravi asks his secretary (Deepika Chikalia) to also fall in love with Vicky. Later, Aatmaram finds that Vicky has fallen in love with a prostitute's daughter and this leads to a fight between Vicky and Aatmaram, leading to Vicky leaving the house and Atmaram changing his will and transferring the whole of the properties presently in his name to his daughter Aarthi alone. Vicky is angry at his father, but is not interested in a share of the property. Meanwhile, Ravi asks Suraj to act as if he loves Aarthi and to marry her later so that now that Vicky has been debarred by Aatmaram, the whole of the property of Aatmram would be in the name of Aarthi alone and by this way, by becoming Aarthi's trusted husband, Suraj can later become the proud owner of Atmaram's property. Meanwhile, while trying to woo Aarthi, Suraj starts ignoring Poonam, but Poonam, who is not aware of 2 facts that Suraj never ever fell in love with him and that presently he is also trying to make Aarthi trust him blindly, invites Suraj to her room in the hotel where she dances to celebrate her birthday. But the same night she gets murdered. Aarthi, who is very keen and enthusiastic to become a detective herself is put on an operation by Ravi to provide evidence that Suraj is involved in the murder of Poonam and to start collecting evidence, but convinces Aarthi to not inform DIG Sharma or any police inspector about this. The 4 youngsters Suraj, Aarthi, Vicky and the secretary to Ravi trust the Lawyer-cum-Novelist Mr. Ravi, so much that they blindly follow his dictates. But this leads to Suraj being accused in the murder of Poonam, and Vicky being suspected of kidnapping or being responsible for Atmaram missing. The rest of the story is about whether Ravi is a mastermind involved in all these events, or is innocent. The story is about unfolding the mystery as to how the things he made the 4 youngsters do, will help in ensuring that Chamanlal's 10 Crores does not go to Vakil Jamuna Das and Babubhai, but to the right person and in ensuring that his own mother does not get into trouble.

Houlston was Wales welterweight champion from 1938 until he relinquished the belt with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Houlston decision to join the Merchant Navy in 1939 resulted in him engaging in no professional bouts until he left the service in 1946. On his return to professional boxing after the war, Houlston switched to middleweight and made one unsuccessful attempt at the Welsh title. His boxing career lasted from 1935 to 1949. He was predicted to be a World Middleweight Champion before the war. Career history Houlston was born in Cardiff in 1917 and was one of eleven children.Jones (2009) pp. 68–69 He grew up in Nora Street in the district of Splott. Houlston took to boxing as a youth, winning three British school titles. He turned professional in 1935, after he controversially lost the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association final on points to local rival, Albert Barnes. Houlston was an elusive fighter with a good left punch and strong defensive skills. Of his 27 winning fights only one failed to go the full distance, showing an inability to finish opponents through heavy punching. Welterweight Houlston took Fred Yates as his manager and trained under Ernie Hurford. His first recorded professional fight was against Douglas Lewis on 10 August 1935 at the Labour Stadium in Merthyr. The six round fight went the full distance with the referee giving the decision to Lewis. He fought at least another three times in 1935, winning all three on points. Houlston continued his winning streak into 1936, with victories over Eddie Cullen of Ynysddu and Tommy Davies of Tylorstown, both held at the Market Hall in Caerphilly. His win over Davies was the first of four known fights he undertook in May 1936, all wins. He continued his punishing schedule with another four contests in August, with only a draw against Norman Rees of Abercwmboi spoiling a perfect start to the year. Houlston finished the year with wins over Joe Thomas and Percy Enoch, before recording a draw with Les Greenaway at the King's Theatre in Cardiff. To this point Houlston has conducted all his fights in south Wales, and all against local fighters, working his way through the available Welsh welterweights. He continued this strategy through 1937, with three wins and a draw. With twenty bouts behind him, and just one loss in his opening fight, Houlston was placing himself into contention for a shot at the Wales Welterweight Championship title. A win over Curly Edwards at Pillgwelly Social Club in Newport in March 1938 set up a title eliminator with Mog Gwilliam of Pencoed. The fifteen round bout was scheduled for 3 May at the Mannesman Hall in Swansea. Gwilliam was the more experienced fighter, but came into the fight with two losses in the last three months. The fight went the full distance and the referee gave the decision to Houlston, setting up a challenge for the Wales welterweight title, held by Jack Moody of Pontypridd. Before he faced Moody, Houlston was on the card to face newly crowned Irish Welterweight champion Paddy Roche at Somerton Park in Newport. 3,500 spectators turned out to watch the match, which resulted in a win for Houlston on points. Houlston and Moody met on 25 July at the Pill Athletic Ground in Newport. Again Houlston took his opponent the full distance and again he was awarded the points decision, making him the Wales Weltereight Champion. With the Welsh title came greater recognition and Houlston was now in demand by promoters in England. In August he beat Johnny Lafferty in Liverpool and followed this with a win over Jack Morgan in Newport. Houlston then lost to George Odwell in Gloucester, the match being stopped in the eighth by the referee. Houlston recovered from this loss with a draw and then a winning rematch encounter with Southern area champion Norman Snow. He then finished the year with a loss to Harry Craster at Earls Court in London. Houlston has just one recorded fight in 1939, a points loss to Lefty Satan Flynn. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Houlston relinquished his Welsh title and joined the war effort. If he had joined the Army or Navy his boxing career would have probably continued, as the forces organised their own boxing clubs. Instead Houlston followed his brother into the Merchant Navy and was unable to fight in organised bouts. This led to seven years without a professional fight and during this period also developed a drink problem. Middleweight On his return to the sport in 1946, Houlston was now fighting at middleweight. He lost his first encounter to Tommy Jones of Derby, but then beat Tommy Davies, the Wales middleweight champion in a non-title encounter. He finished the year losing to future British Light-heavyweight Champion, Alex Buxton. Having shown that he had the ability to stop the Welsh champion Davies, Houlston set his sights on winning a second Wales title. In 1947 he beat both Norman Jones and Des Jones in title eliminater contests to set up a return meeting with Davies, this time for the middleweight belt. Before facing Davies, Houlsten fought Johnny Williams, the result was a draw. On 12 January 1948, Houlston and Davies met at the Glyn Hall in Neath. The 15 round bout went the distance and the decision went with the champion, Davies. Houlston continued to chase the middleweight title, and beat Koffi Kiteman just two weeks later, but after being knocked-out by Des Jones in a middleweight title eliminator his dreams of a second belt appeared slight. After suffering a technical knockout defeat to Alby Hollister in West Ham on 15 February 1949, Houlston decided to retire from boxing. Later life Houlston returned to Cardiff, living in the same district he grew up in. He was a regular at the Clifton, a public house on the corner of Clifton Street and Broadway. He was known to entertain drinkers by inviting them to hit him in the head while he remained stood on a handkerchief to show his dodging skills. He worked at the Llanwern steelworks in Newport, and in 1962 he collapsed and died at work from a heart attack. He was 45.

Estianty was born in Surabaya, East Java, and showed interest in music at an early age, winning a marching band competition while still in elementary school. She began training as a disc jockey while still in junior high school; it was around this time that she first met Dhani. After studying at the University of Indonesia, Estianty joined Dewa 19 as a backing vocalist. In 1999, she and Dhani came up with the idea for the musical duo Ratu. Estianty played the music, while other women – first Pinkan Mambo, then Mulan Jameela – sang. Ratu was highly successful. After the dissolution of the band in 2007 and bitter divorce in September 2008, Estianty formed Duo Maia with Mey Chan. She is currently focusing on producing music with her label, Le Moesik. Early life Estianty was born in Surabaya, East Java, on 27 January 1976. She was the fifth of six children born to Harjono Sigit and his wife Kusthini. She is the great-granddaughter of Tjokroaminoto, a nationalist Muslim leader and National Hero, through her father's side. As a child, Estianty often fought with her classmates; in an interview with the weekly entertainment magazine Tabloid Nova, she recalled that, while at Yohanes Gabriel Catholic Elementary School in Surabaya, she once hit a classmate with an object so hard that the classmate began to bleed profusely. She also took up music during this time, leading her marching band to win a national championship; she also took up the piano. As a student at State Junior High School 1 in Surabaya, Estianty took up modelling; in 1990 she won the Yess Modelling Competition for Teenagers, which provoked some modelling offers. She also began working part-time at a radio station and learned how to be a disc jockey. At a birthday party while in junior high school, a friend introduced her to Ahmad Dhani; Estianty and Dhani began writing songs for the piano together. Having received good marks in elementary school and junior high school, while in senior high school she began dating, first with a classmate then with Dhani, and her scores dropped drastically. Towards the end of senior high school, Estianty and her father began arguing about her work and poor performance at school. Estianty threatened to move out; in response, Sigit said he would support her, on the condition that she continue her studies at a state university. Estianty enrolled at the University of Indonesia, first in the Dutch literature programme and later in the communications programme. During this time, she became a backing vocalist for Dhani's band Dewa 19. The two married in the late 1990s. Personal life Ahmad Dhani Estianty and Dhani divorced on 23 September 2008. The separation of the couple, who had been married for twelve years and had three sons; Ahmad Al Ghazali, Ahmad El Jallaludin Rumi, and Abdul Qodir Jaelani, was not amicable. Estianty filed a police complaint accusing Dhani of abuse, and Dhani refused to give Estianty custody of their children, appealing to the Supreme Court of Indonesia after several lower courts ruled that the children were Estianty's. In 2011, Dhani was reportedly in a relationship with Mulan and had a child with her, and Dhani gave Estianty visitation rights in 2012. Maia submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court, because she could not see her children easily. On 14 May 2013, the Supreme Court decided that the children could choose themselves since the children were considered capable to make a decision, to which Dhani agreed. On 29 October 2018, she married businessman Irwan Mussry in Tokyo, Japan. Ratu In 1999, Estianty and Dhani agreed to establish a musical duo consisting of a singer and musician, based on concepts pioneered by international bands like Roxette and Savage Garden. Pinkan Mambo, a café singer, was chosen to be the second member of the newly formed group, named Ratu, meaning Queen. After three years of training, Ratu released its first album, Bersama (Together), in 2003, which was influenced by R&B.; Maia wrote seven songs on the album, while Dhani did the other three. The album was a commercial success, selling 250,000 copies. Although Mambo and Estianty began work on another album, Mambo withdrew from the group in 2004 after widespread coverage of her premarital pregnancy. Maia and Dhani began looking for a replacement. They agreed on Mulan Jameela, a café singer from Bandung who took the stage name of Mulan Kwok; her appointment was announced on 7 April 2005. That August, Ratu released the album Ratu and Friends in collaboration with numerous other artists. The album, which featured two songs by Ratu, sold more than 400,000 copies and was certified double platinum in Indonesia. The title of the single \\"Teman Tapi Mesra\\", often abbreviated TTM and released to promote Ratu and Friends, became widely used to describe those in a physical relationship without an emotional one. The following year, Maia garnered a role in the Trans TV-funded comedy programme Extravanganza, where she was the only non-Sundanese cast member. Also in 2006, Ratu released Nomor Satu (Number One), with pop-rock influences; Estianty wrote most of the songs. The album was a commercial success, selling 200,000 copies nationally on the day of its release, a record for a work by a female Indonesian group. However, conflict between Dhani and Estianty, as well as concerns over Jameela's payment, led Ratu to disband in 2007. Duo Maia and acting Estianty with Mey Chan formed Duo Maia. Together, they released the album, Maia and Friends, in 2008, which was in direct competition with Jameela's album. The songs on the album were all written by Estianty. It featured duets with artists such as Gita Gutawa, Gigi, and Glenn Fredly. That year, she was one of ten women honoured at the Tribute to Women ceremony held by the ANTARA News Agency; other honourees included author Ayu Utami and economist Sri Mulyani Indrawati. Estianty played in Kata Maaf Terakhir (The Last Apology) in 2009 as Dania, the ex-wife to whom Darma (Tio Pakusadewo) must apologise before he dies. Marcel Thee, writing in The Jakarta Globe, described her performance as well done. That same year, she released Sang Juara (The Champion) as part of Duo Maia. In an interview with The Jakarta Post, she explained that she had written the titular song after hearing Queen's power ballad \\"We Are the Champions\\" at a basketball match; she realised that there were no Indonesian songs which could be used in the same situation. Along with Dewiq and Agus Wisman, she was a judge of the Global TV-sponsored musical talent show Dream Girls, which was open exclusively to mothers. In early 2010, Estianty established the recording studio Le Moesiek. Several established artists, including Krisdayanti and Julia Perez, signed on quickly. At the time, she owned five other business ventures, including a steakhouse, an outsourcing company, and a café. Estianty was reported in October 2010 to be working on a cover album which featured works originally sung by Nike Ardilla, Hetty Koes Endang, and Atiek CB. Later that year, she was chosen as Ambassador on Domestic Violence by the Indonesian Ministry for Women's Issues. Dhani objected to the appointment and threatened to sue the ministry, as he took offence to suggestions that he had abused Estianty. In April 2012, Estianty announced that, although Duo Maia would continue to perform, she intended to focus on her work as a producer. She had spent the previous several months focusing on her managerial duties at Le Moesik. Meanwhile, Chan would begin a solo career.

There are many varieties of criticism. This article describes common types that occur regularly in everyday life. For other criteria that classify criticisms, see . For more subject-specific information, see the pages on topics such as art, film, literature, theatre, or architecture. Aesthetic criticism Aesthetic criticism is a part of aesthetics concerned with critically judging beauty and ugliness, tastefulness and tastelessness, style and fashion, meaning and quality of design—and issues of human sentiment and affect (the evoking of pleasure and pain, likes and dislikes). Most parts of human life have an aesthetic dimension, which means there is plenty potential for criticism. Often architecture criticism is considered the highest form of aesthetic criticism, because architecture combines art, science and technology to build a pleasing home environment, a \\"living space\\" that people must inhabit everyday, more or less permanently. An aesthetic critic however does not simply say \\"it's beautiful\\" or \\"it's ugly.\\" Instead, the aim is to explain the meaning of a work of art, why something is beautiful or ugly, or how the meaning of a design should be interpreted, the stronger and weaker sides of a cultural object, etc. For this purpose, aesthetic critics have a toolkit of criteria they can use in their commentary. These criteria include such things as: * The motive behind creative activity * Total context within which creative activity occurred * Techniques or physical forces used to create the aesthetic effect * Values, sentiments, interests, needs or ideals that a phenomenon communicates * Relationship of an object of criticism to associated objects, themes, traditions, or genres * Interaction between observer and observed, and the overall effect * Function the object of the criticism fulfills Using these kinds of criteria, which usually assume extensive relevant knowledge, aesthetic critics can inform their audience about the achievements and limitations of the object of aesthetic criticism. In this way, they can draw attention to aesthetic issues most people might have overlooked, educate people in their aesthetic appreciation, and stimulate debate about what kinds of aesthetic expressions are preferable. In part, aesthetic criticism can genuinely prove aesthetic propositions;– if they concern matters of factual or logical evidence. For example, either an artist had a certain motivation, or s/he did not. But insofar as \\"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\", there is always also a subjective element in aesthetic criticism, which is not provable, but expresses a preference, a personal taste. It may be possible to explain that preference, but it may not be possible to compare it meaningfully with other preferences. Logical criticism In a logical criticism, an objection is raised about an idea, argument, action or situation on the ground that it does not make rational sense (there is something wrong with it because it is illogical, it does not follow, or it violates basic conventions of meaning;– see Straight and Crooked Thinking). Such an objection usually refers to assumptions, coherence, implications, and intent. Thus, the illogicality may involve something that: * Is being assumed or inferred improperly, without reasonable ground * Is internally inconsistent or self-contradictory in a way that makes it impossible to maintain all its content at once (because it would affirm and negate the same thing) * Has implications or effects that are contrary to itself, or negate itself * Has effects contrary to its own purpose or intent, or contrary to the purpose or intent of someone concerned with it * involves a language that superficially makes sense, but defies logic when examined closely Logical criticism is rooted in the basic cognitive principles that guide the behavior of humans and other sentient organisms: stimulus identification (\\"this is the recognized identity of X\\"), stimulus distinction (\\"this is different from that\\"), and stimulus generalization (\\"this is the same, or like that\\" or \\"this is an instance of type X\\"). The Greek philosopher Aristotle stated the most basic building blocks of logic as the law of identity, the law of non-contradiction and the law of the excluded middle. These are basic conditions for making meaningful sense, and for non-arbitrary representation. Logical criticism presupposes that people accept at least the most basic rules of logic. If people believe \\"things mean just what they want them to mean\\", or if people constantly \\"change the meaning to suit the moment\\", logical criticism is not at all effective. Logical criticism assumes that there is a definite, identifiable, discoverable meaning, or at least that something can be proved meaningless (because it lacks any predictable or knowable pattern). Logical criticism also presupposes that people agree about at least some basic facts and assumptions about the situation, or have in common at least some beliefs. It is not possible to argue about a logical criticism with somebody with whom one does not share any assumptions at all, or who is unwilling to consider at least the possibility that a given proposition might be true (or false). Very often, logical arguments take the form \\"suppose that X is the case\\", but if people reject the \\"suppose\\" or cannot imagine it, it becomes difficult to get the logical criticism off the ground. Factual criticism In a factual (empirical) criticism, an objection is raised about an idea, argument, action or situation on the ground that there is something wrong with the evidence of the known experience relevant to it. Typically, * Relevant purported facts are labeled false or implausible, i.e., not facts at all. * Relevant facts are said not to have been definitely established as true, or the likelihood that they are true, has not been established. * Relevant facts mentioned imply different stories that cannot be reconciled. Accepting a fact would imply another fact that contradicts it in some way (this overlaps with logical criticism). * The presentation of facts is biased. Important relevant facts are missing, or the total factual context is ignored. * Other relevant facts, which have not been mentioned, shed a different light on the issue. * Facts focused upon are not relevant to the purpose of those concerned. Logical and factual criticism is generally considered important to ensure the consistency, authenticity and predictability of behavior of any kind. Without the presence of the relevant consistency, authenticity and predictability, one cannot make appropriate sense of behavior, which becomes disorienting and creates confusion, and therefore cannot guide behavioral choices effectively. Philosophers have often debated about \\"what makes a fact, a fact.\\"John Irvine, Ian Miles & Jeff Evans (eds), Demystifying Social Statistics, Pluto, London, 1979. The basic problem with facts is that observations, made using the five senses, are never completely free from interpretation – to understand a fact as a fact, requires being able to place its meaning, which in turn requires basic cognitive categorizations not contained in the observed thing itself. A fact is concluded in the interaction between the observer and the observed. Nevertheless, most people agree there are such things as the stubborn facts, i.e., evidence no one can deny, because everybody experiences the evidence in the same way, under the same conditions. That reality is essential for effective factual criticism. If people regard factual evidence as simply a subjective interpretation of experience, then factual criticism is ineffective. Factual criticism assumes, that people agree there exists a reality beyond their personal experience, that it is possible to obtain reliable information about it, and that people ordinarily experience those facts in the same way. Positive criticism A positive criticism draws attention to a good or positive aspect of something that is being ignored, disregarded or overlooked. People may be able to see only the negative side of something, so that it becomes necessary to highlight the positive side. A positive criticism may also be a type of self-justification or self-defense. The term \\"positive criticism\\" is also used in the sense that the criticism is \\"well-meant\\" or \\"well-intentioned\\" (\\"I mean it in a positive way\\"). Here, the criticism intends to serve a purpose that is constructive, or that the targeted person would approve of. The basic aim of positive criticism is usually to provide a better orientation, or frame of reference, for behavior. It provides ideas people can act on to improve the situation. At the very least, it provides more choices for behavior, and therefore potentially enlarges behavioral freedom. A positive criticism can be stated as a positive alternative (\\"there are good reasons for thinking that we are better off to do Y, instead of X\\"). It does not necessarily say, that the option criticized is all bad, but rather that an alternative option is better, or preferable. Negative criticism Negative criticism means voicing an objection to something, only with the purpose of showing that it is wrong, false, mistaken, nonsensical, objectionable, or disreputable. Generally, it suggests disapproval of something, or disagreement with something – it emphasizes the downsides of something. Negative criticism is also often interpreted as an attack against a person (ad hominem). That may not have been the intention, but it can be interpreted that way. Negative criticism can have the effect that the people criticized feel attacked or insulted by it, so that they either do not take it seriously, or react badly to it. Much often depends on how much negative criticism there is, and how much criticism is transmitted at once. People can handle some negative criticism, but they may not be able to handle a whole lot of negative criticism, at least not all at once. The downside of negative criticism is, often, that it tells people what they cannot or should not do or believe, rather than telling them what they can or should do (what possibilities or options there are). So it may be disabling, rather than enabling. People might reply to a negative criticism that \\"this is all very well, but I cannot do anything with it\\", or they might say \\"now what?!\\". Yet, negative criticism may be necessary at times, to prevent a course of action harmful to the people concerned. If people are afraid to state a negative criticism, the existing problem might get worse. The upside of negative criticism is that it can explain what the limitations of an idea, an action or a situation are, for the sake of being realistic. Sometimes it is necessary to say \\"no\\" to something (and explain why \\"no\\" is \\"no\\"). In the modern world, negative criticism has acquired the stigma of \\"being negative\\", and people who make negative criticisms can be easily exploited or manipulated. For this reason, many people nowadays express their negative criticism simply by not saying anything, not paying attention to something or someone, or by being absent. Constructive criticism Constructive criticism aims to show that an intent or purpose of something is better served by an alternative approach. In this case, making the criticism is not necessarily deemed wrong, and its purpose is respected; rather, it is claimed that the same goal could be better achieved via a different route. Constructive criticisms are often suggestions for improvement – how things could be done better or more acceptably. They draw attention to how an identified problem could be solved, or how it could be solved better. Constructive criticism is more likely accepted if the criticism is timely, clear, specific, detailed and actionable.J. addle River, N.J.: Pearson Education, Inc, 1980; pp. 78–80.Katz, Ralph. Motivating Technical Professionals Today. IEEE Engineering Management Review, Vol. 41, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 28–38 Both negative and constructive criticism have their appropriate uses, but often it is considered a requirement of criticism that they are combined. Thus, it is often considered that those who find fault with something should also offer an option for putting it right. More generally, any rule for behavior of any kind usually implies both \\"do's\\" and \\"don't s\\". Doing something usually also implies not doing something else, and, not doing something, often implies doing something else. There is therefore a conscious choice \\"to do this, or do that\\", but not both at the same time. So, to orient behaviour, people need to know both what is \\"ruled in\\" and what is \\"ruled out\\". If the criticism concerns only one aspect, but not the other, it may supply only incomplete information, which is not really adequate to orient behaviour or guide action. One of the most elementary reasons why a rule is ignored, flouted or subverted is, because either the positive or the negative aspect of what it means is unspecified. Destructive criticism Destructive criticism aims to destroy the target of criticism, by making the destructive criticism (e.g., \\"You should shut up and follow the program.\\"). The aim is to show that the point of view of someone else has no validity at all, or lacks any merit. In some contexts, destructive criticism is regarded as an undesirable nuisance, a threat, or as completely unjustifiable, especially if it involves personal attacks. Destructive criticism is often criticized because it has a destructive effect, instead of a positive effect (this may also just be an accusation or allegation, if there is no proof that the effect actually is destructive). However, in political and military contexts, destructive criticisms may be essential to save resources, or to save lives among one's own group. An idea in itself is not dangerous, but an idea proposed in a particular context can be very dangerous, so that people feel that it should be disarmed by mercilessly criticizing it. The ultimate destructive criticism occurs when people and property are physically destroyed. The term \\"destructive criticism\\" is also used to mean that the level, scope or intensity of criticism is such, that it becomes mainly destructive. In this context, people believe that the criticism is so great, or there is so much criticism, that it only destroys things. For example, a debate or controversy can get out of control, so that everybody is at war with everybody else, and everybody is opposed to everybody else. In that case, it may well be that the criticism is being overdone (\\"overkill\\"). What started out as a structured dialogue to identify conflicting aspects of a situation, ends up as a chaos in which nobody can agree with anyone else anymore. Destructive criticism from parents and other authority figures causes psychological harm to children that results in lower levels of self-esteem, social acceptance, scholastic competence, behavioral conduct, global self- worth and generally poorer self-perceptions. This is a significant issue. In this study of 144 children from a middle class environment, only six children (4%) reported that they had never been subject to physical punishment or the target of rejecting, demeaning, terrorizing, destructively criticizing or insulting statements. Some parents may ask how do you correct a child who is misbehaving if you do not criticize.Solomon, C. Ruth, and Francoise Serres. \\"Effects of Parental Verbal Aggression on Children's Self-esteem and School Marks.\\" Child Abuse & Neglect (Pergamon) 23, no. 4 (1999): 339–51. Practical criticism Practical criticism is an objection or appraisal of the type, that something \\"does or does not work\\" in practical reality, due to some reason or cause. The focus is on useful effect. Often people say, \\"That might be fine in theory, but in practice it does not work.\\" Inversely, they might show with experiment that something works well in practice, even although the theory says this is not possible – so that the theory ought to be adjusted. Practical criticism usually refers to relevant practical experience, to reveal why an action is wrongheaded, or under what conditions it would succeed. When someone proposes an idea, others might first consider if it makes sense – but often raise concerns about practicality and consequences. For example, would relevant people or organizations be better off or worse off? Does it get in the way of other things? Practical criticisms are effective, if people are concerned with practicalities. If, however, people are purely concerned with what things mean, or ought to mean, they may not care about whether their way of seeing things is \\"practical\\" or not. People might hold on to their beliefs or defend them, even if they are not very practical at all, because they feel those beliefs are essential to who they are. Practical criticism usually succeeds best, if it is made on the basis of the practical experience of the critic. Somebody who has practical experience with an issue, is usually best placed to make a practical criticism. Theoretical criticism Theoretical criticism is concerned with the meaning of ideas, including ideas on which a practice is based. It is concerned with the coherence or meaningfulness of a theory, its correspondence to reality, the validity of its purpose, and the limitations of the viewpoint it offers. Theories can be criticized *from the point of view of other theories (\\"how much sense does it make\\") *internally \\"in their own terms\\" (\\"is it consistent\\") *in terms of the experiential evidence there is for those theories (\\"how well does the theory correspond to the facts\\") *the usefulness or practical gain of a theory. *the moral implications of the theory for human action and behaviour. At issue is not simply whether an idea makes sense or is consistent, but whether it makes sense and is consistent in terms of the theoretical framework it is part of. In other words, at issue is the relationship between many linked ideas. What effect does the adoption of one idea have for a lot of related ideas, and how does a theory relate to all the evidence it can be called upon to explain. A theory can consist of one major hypothesis, but usually a theory consists of a series of linked hypotheses. Adopting one hypothesis can have many effects for other related hypotheses. The merits of theories are usually judged according to three main criteria: their usefulness, their explanatory power and their predictive power. A theory is useful if it can help to guide or orient activity, serves the relevant purpose, or if it helps to make sense of things. A theory with great explanatory power is a theory which is able to account for all the relevant evidence, not just some. If the assumptions made by the theory are well-taken, it can predict effects, outcomes and results quite accurately. If theories are criticized, it is usually on the ground that they are not useful, do not speak to the situation, and fail to explain or predict things properly. Usually, the best theory is the simplest theory that explains the most. A theory that becomes extremely complicated often no longer provides much guidance, because it is no longer clear that anything in particular definitely follows from it. However, theories can also be judged according to their moral implications: if the theory is adopted, how does this affect the values and behaviour of people who subscribe to it? Theoretical criticism often occurs in the context of eclecticism and intellectual opportunism, when people more or less creatively \\"cobble together\\" in one interpretation a bunch of ideas and models that draw from a variety of sources. The criticism might be that those ideas do not belong together, that they are not compatible, or that they produce an elaborate description that fails to explain anything. The theoretical critic then attempts to redress the situation by showing that a consistent theory requires abandoning or changing some ideas, or discarding the whole eclectic combination in favour of a more consistent interpretation. Public and private criticism Criticism can be expressed publicly or privately. The most private criticism exists only in the mind of the critic. The most obvious reason why criticisms are not expressed, or only expressed privately, is that the critic believes public knowledge of the criticism would harm the critic or others. People often first express criticisms privately to test their validity, formulation, or reactions to them. It may require courage, conviction, or certainty to express a criticism publicly. However, the distinction between \\"private\\" and \\"public\\" itself may be rather vague, or there may be various gradations between \\"absolutely private\\" and \\"definitely public\\". Yet even if a criticism is publicly accessible already, it may remain relatively unknown, because it is only available in a rather obscure place, or because people are simply not looking for it. The criticism may exist for years, before someone digs it out, and presents it in a forum that makes it widely known. The degree to which criticisms are made privately or publicly, often depends on customary or legal norms for expressing criticism. Thus, the degree to which a criticism is accessible may be influenced by moral considerations, fear, the human or commercial interests at stake, or authority issues. Criticisms can of course also be expressed anonymously or under a pseudonym, in which case the identity of the critic or the source of the criticism remains unknown. In this case, the criticism exists in public, but where exactly it came from remains private. If a criticism is actively suppressed or censored, then although there may have been an attempt to publicize it, it may not become public knowledge because there was no possibility for making it public. Yet criticisms can also travel very fast \\"through the grapevine\\" so that, although they are publicly denied or ignored, everyone knows what they are, because their peers informally communicated the criticism. Moral criticism Moral criticism is basically concerned with the rights and wrongs of values, ethics or norms people uphold, what is good and bad about what people do, or the rights and wrongs of the conditions people face. Morality is concerned with what is good and bad for people, and how we know that. There are many forms of moral criticism, such as: * Showing that actions taken are inconsistent or incompatible with certain values being upheld, or values deemed desirable * Counterposing one set of values to another, with the claim that the one set is better than the other * Arguing that certain values are intrinsically objectionable, regardless of any other values that may be relevant * Arguing that certain values ought to be adopted or rejected for some reason * Arguing that, for the sake of integrity, somebody should or shouldn't do something Rational or civil morality is based on the idea that people should be treated in the same ways, in the same kind of situation; the same norm should apply to all people concerned, in the same relevant situation. The exception that proves the rule implies that there does exist a moral rule, to which it is an exception, for a definite and explicable reason. Such a morality is often assumed because, without it, human behaviour would be unpredictable or arbitrary, and cannot be relied upon; the necessary co-operation between people as social beings would be hindered. Modern jurisprudence and legal systems are, at least in principle, based on this idea. It originates from the two social norms, often expressed in religions, that one should \\"do unto others as one would like them to do unto oneself\\" and \\"not do unto others as one would not like them to do unto oneself.\\" Consistent behaviour in this sense is regarded as most likely to be effective for survival and achievement in the long run, in contrast to chaotic or arbitrary behaviour (\\"arbitrary\\" in the sense that one's own interests and needs, or the interests and needs of others are not properly taken into account). Nevertheless, values people hold often clash, and how \\"consistency\\" should be interpreted may be disputed. Hence moral criticism ranges from whether there should be a moral rule at all and the justification of a moral rule, to the interpretation of the meaning of a moral rule, and to how it is in practice applied. The debate can be pursued formally (for example by lawyers, judges, religious authorities and politicians) or informally (by any citizens of a community). Philosophers of ethics aim to shed light on moral disputes by means of critical thinking, often with the aim of clearing up moral confusions, and improving moral behaviour. Scientific criticism Scientific criticism is not primarily concerned with moral values, but more with quantitative or categorical values. It focuses on whether an idea can be proven true or false, or what the limits of its valid application are, quite irrespective of whether people like that or not, or what the moral implications are. For this purpose, the scientist employs logic and relevant evidence offered by experience, as well as experimentation, and gives attention to the intent and purpose of relevant activity. Obviously a scientist is also a moral being with moral biases, but science aims to ensure that moral biases do not prejudice scientific findings (the requirement of objectivity). If scientists would ignore relevant evidence pertaining to a case, for example because of some personal bias, they could be criticized for that. Scientists can also criticize a specific morality on scientific grounds, but in a scientific capacity they do not do so on the ground that the morality itself is intrinsically objectionable, but rather that it cannot be reconciled with the facts, i.e., it involves assumptions or valuations contrary to known logical and factual evidence. Science is typically not concerned with judging the desirability of ends in themselves, but rather with the relationship of means and ends. The question in scientific activity is usually to ascertain – with reasoning, study and experiment – whether the chosen means can or cannot, as a matter of objective fact, produce the envisaged result, and why that is. So a scientist mainly aims to prove with evidence and reasoning, that if one wants to achieve X, then one must do Y, or not do Z. But whether one wants to achieve X or not, may be a separate question, on which a scientist cannot adjudicate, because telling people what they ought to do with themselves falls outside the realm of scientific inquiry. At most a scientist might say that, if X is achieved, it will have specific benefits, and if it is not achieved, it will have certain harmful effects or costs for the people concerned (or vice versa). When scientists criticize other scientists, the criticism can be very specialized and technical, so that it may not be very easy to understand the meaning – unless one is familiar with the particular scientific discipline. There are some general rules for scientific criticism, but most often each branch of scientific research has its own rules and formats for criticizing. Science is above all a search for truth, and therefore if scientists are dishonest (for example, by faking the evidence), they are not being \\"scientific\\", dishonesty then is an obvious target for criticism. Other, more common, criticisms relate to assumptions, sampling bias, methodological error, statistical issues or invalid conclusions. Religious criticism Religious criticism is primarily concerned with judging actions and ideas according to whether God (or the Gods, or other divine beings) would regard them as good or bad for human beings (or for the world). Normally a religion has some sacred or holy texts, which serve as an authoritative guide to interpreting actions and ideas as either good or bad. From these, religious authorities derive norms for how people ought to live and act in the world. However, sacred texts may not always be clear, and may require interpretation. Thus, theologians ask critical questions such as, \\"How do we know what God wants for human beings?\\" They try to answer these questions by reasoning based on religious principles, rules, laws, by considering what people experience, and by \\"divine inspiration\\" through prayer and meditation. Religious authorities such as the Pope may criticize how people behave, if the behaviour conflicts with church doctrine. In religious criticism, the motive or intention of the criticism (why somebody is criticizing) is important. Criticism must be offered in the right spirit so that it has a good effect. Religious criticism is successful if it clarifies exactly what is good and bad, and why that is, in such a way that people are convinced to do what religion says is the \\"right thing\\" to do. Religious criticism is often very difficult to do well, because people's spiritual beliefs are very personal and the personal meaning attached to spiritual matters may be rather unusual – it may not be so easy to understand it, it may not be so rational or logical, and it may not conform to a shared framework or shared interpretation. In addition, because it is a very personal matter, it may require a great deal of respectful sensitivity to approach a spiritual issue in a good way. Scholarly criticism Criticism is considered \\"scholarly\\" only if it conforms to scholarly standards. A scholarly critic probes deeply into a problem, looking at all relevant evidence, the quality of reasoning involved, and the uses or purposes at stake. When he considers a problem, a scholar usually becomes familiar with the relevant background literature. He tries to make sure that he cannot be accused of inconsistent reasoning, that arguments are free from factual error, and that all relevant aims, motives, and purposes are clear. A scholar also conscientiously documents \\"who said what and when\\" so that sources for all arguments are clear. Thus, the scholar tries to be as objective and fact-based as possible. In this way, criticism is much more difficult to ignore or to refute. Most often, a scholarly publication is refereed (\\"screened\\") by other knowledgeable scholars, who critically examine the text to find possible faults, and possibly suggest alterations. In this way, scholars always try to ensure the quality of what is said. A scholarly criticism is successful if it provides a proof or refutation that nobody can rationally deny, so that most people accepted it as definitive. Much scholarly criticism does not provide truly spectacular proofs or refutations. That is difficult to do, if many bright minds have worked or are working on the same issue – but a careful, methodically developed criticism can nevertheless contribute valuable and significant information. To substantiate even a small scholarly criticism can take much research, and can require perseverance and patience from the scholar. A scholarly critic primarily aims to improve understanding of an issue, by means of research and the criticism of research, irrespective of any prejudices about the issue. Scholarly criticism does not mean impartiality or neutrality. Indeed, the very fact that someone has developed a scholarly criticism implies they are taking a partisan position. However, scholars usually submit their own considerations and findings to a public forum that evaluates criticisms on their merits and faults, with the explicit aim to contribute to the search for truth, and with the understanding that the criticism could be wrong. Thus, scholarly criticism involves the attitude that one is open to criticism. What exactly the applicable \\"scholarly standards\\" for criticism are, can be open to debate. Nevertheless, participants in different academic disciplines or scientific specialisms usually operate with a reasonable amount of consensus about what the standards are. In general terms, such things as \\"lying, cheating, fraud, misinformation and misrepresentation\\" disqualify a criticism from being \\"scholarly\\". Scholarly criticism requires the greatest respect for truth, honesty in presenting a case, and a form of communication acceptable to the scholarly community. Critical criticism Critical criticism is \\"criticism for the sake of criticism\\", or criticism which voices an objection. The term was made famous by a polemical text written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels entitled The Holy Family. The most popular modern form of critical criticism is contrarianism. The highest positive value of the critical critic is to be critical. To be critical, or to be a dissident is, in this case, a way of life, the highest good. Such a position is itself often criticized for its motivation. People often feel that there should be a good reason for being critical, and that being critical simply for the sake of being critical is not a good reason. Instead, it is seen as a nuisance that can lead to blithe cynicism without constructive result. If everything is demolished by criticism, there may be nothing of value left. If people's only stance is to be critical, they can be accused of only negating things, without affirming anything, which provides no positive orientation for behaviour informing people about \\"what to do\\". People don't need talk about what is not possible, they want to know what is possible. Critical critics might respond to such an accusation, by saying that it is surely always valuable and important to highlight the limitations of ideas and happenings, and that this could not very well occur, if criticism was banned (\\"in a world gone mad, it makes sense to be critical\\"). It may be necessary to point out that things are wrong, even if it is not known how to put it right (yet). Critical critics might argue that it is necessary to be \\"forever on guard\\" against illusions, and to be \\"eternally vigilant\\" against nonsense. Without criticism, things are not relativised, or put in proportion. A typical reply to this argument is, that many illusions in the world cannot be abolished simply by criticizing them. That is, people actually have to do something positively, to establish the truth, and they cannot very well do that, if they only focus on \\"what is not there\\", or on \\"what is wrong\\". If the whole situation was turned around by taking action, there might be no need anymore for criticism. Criticism would become irrelevant or meaningless in that case. So the means critics use may not lead to the ends they favour. Sometimes people \\"just have to be quiet\\" and take action. In that case, critical criticism itself seems to contain an ultimate limitation: to get rid of the illusion or falsehood, might require getting rid of critical criticism, or going beyond it. To persist forever in critical criticism, might itself perpetuate an illusion, and the critical critics, if they were completely consistent, might not be able to survive their own \\"critical attitude to everything\\". Or, at the very least, they would have to be critical of their own critical criticism – they might be defeated by their own stance that there is nothing immune to criticism. Radical and revolutionary criticism The word \\"radical\\" derives from the Latin word \\"radix\\" (\\"root\\"). Thus, radical criticism means criticism that goes to the root of things, to the roots of the problem. Revolutionary criticism is criticism that aims to overturn or overthrow an existing idea or state of affairs. Thus, an existing idea may be turned upside down. Revolutionary criticism is sometimes also used in the sense of criticism that is unprecedented, or previously unheard of. Typically these kinds of criticism are associated with the youth, who are the new generation finding their identity in a battle with the older generations. The radical critic aims to track down the most fundamental assumptions underlying an idea, position or situation in order to show the ultimate reason why it is true or false. The concern is with what something is ultimately based on. For this purpose, radical critics are not satisfied with superficial ideas. They question authority and the status quo. This presupposes the freedom to criticize, and to pursue a train of thought to its ultimate limits. Radical critics keep asking \\"why, why, why\\" very thoroughly, until they reach a complete answer to the puzzle of why things appear as they do. Radical criticism may be revolutionary, insofar as its result overthrows previous ideas with a new perspective, but it may also only demolish a particular way of seeing things, or show that an alternative way of seeing things or doing things is possible. Radical or revolutionary criticism is often equated with political extremism, but this is not necessarily the case at all. This type of criticism may only just prove, in a \\"devastatingly simple\\" or even rather innocent way, that something is true or false, contrary to the popular perceptions or cherished beliefs. It may be \\"extreme\\", only in the sense that it falls outside the \\"normal\\" way of seeing things. If radical critics succeed in proving their case, their idea may in due course become accepted as \\"normal\\", and become an ordinary, mainstream idea. Many if not most ideas which people hold nowadays and accept as normal, originally were considered as \\"extremely radical\\", \\"revolutionary\\" or even \\"dangerous\\". It just took a long time before they became generally accepted – the radical thinker, by going beyond the ordinary, was merely ahead of the rest in grasping the essence of the matter. So the distinction between \\"radical\\" and \\"normal\\" is, often, really only a relative one; it may have less to do with the content of ideas, than with how much they are accepted or not. Whereas the radical critic may, in his own day, be regarded as an oddball or a maverick, later on he may be hailed as a great thinker or even a genius. But this is not always the case. After all, even although radical critics may try hard, they may fail to prove the root of the matter, and thus they may be forgotten without acclaim. People may regard them only as \\"troublemakers\\". Radical criticism can be a bit of a gamble, even if the criticism is perfectly valid. The reason is that it may open up a \\"can of worms\\" and unleash intense controversy, which can get beyond what the radical critic can handle, and which lasts for a long time. People may well know that there is a problem, but they prefer to avoid it, because they know that, if it came out into the open, it would cause a pack of trouble. Thus, when the radical critic exposes the problem or proposes a radical solution to it, people can become very agitated. To state a radical criticism often takes considerable courage, because there can be a powerful backlash to reckon with. Skilled radicals therefore try to make sure they can deal with the consequences of making their criticism. If they don't, they could be defeated by what they said. Conservative criticism Conservative criticism is primarily concerned with conformity to a rule or principle, and continuity with the past (a tradition or heritage of some sort). Conservative critics consider that: *everything in the world has its proper and rightful place. *people ought to know what that place is, for their own good. *people ought to stay in their own proper place, because they belong there. *people should not try to leave their proper place in life, or misplace things, because that only causes trouble. *the changes which occur, are only really variations of things which always remain the same in human existence, because \\"that is how people are\\" or \\"that is how society is\\". Conservative criticism is therefore not necessarily \\"narrowminded\\", because knowing what the proper place of things is, might involve a vast knowledge about how things work. There may be very good reasons for keeping things as they are or were. The most common forms of conservative criticism are that somebody is breaking with a rule, wrongly rejecting a tradition, or wrongly placing something where, they think, it does not belong. Conservative critics are as concerned with the future as anybody else, it is just that they expect no more from the future, than there has been in the past; and, to tackle the future, they believe only the \\"tried and tested methods\\" should be used. Typically conservatism is associated with older people, who \\"have seen it all and done it all\\". But conservative criticisms can be made by all kinds of people, they are not automatically \\"conservatives\\" because they make a conservative criticism. Conservative criticism has nothing much to do with \\"left-wing\\" or \\"right-wing\\", because left-wing people are often very conservative, in the defined sense, while right-wing people can also be very radical, in the defined sense. The difference between \\"radical\\" and \\"conservative\\" has more to do with the belief in whether a change to something genuinely new is really possible and necessary. Radicals typically believe strongly that such change is highly desirable and necessary, and that it can be achieved. Their criticism is that there is not enough change. Conservative critics, by contrast, are very skeptical about any such change, because they feel the change is really \\"just another form\\" of something that already exists. The conservative criticism is typically that there has already been too much change, of the wrong kind, and that this change has led people astray – that people should return to how things were always done in the past. A return to the 'correct' tradition, 'correct' ways of the past, is the only big change many conservative critics are interested in. Conservative critics may well recognize that important changes do occur, it is merely that whatever the changes, those changes do not and cannot alter the eternal conditions of human existence. \\"Details\\" may change, but \\"in essence\\" the human predicament remains the same as it has always been. So conservative critics typically emphasize continuity over change. They believe it is just not possible to change human existence very radically, whatever the appearance. Conservative criticism therefore says that, when people claim they are doing something new or have changed things, this is just spurious and superficial, because, in essence, things stay much as they always have been. People may think they are innovating, but in reality most of it has been done before. A true conservative critic does not think in terms of \\"living for the moment\\", but in terms of years, decades, centuries and eternity. He criticizes on the basis of long-lasting principles. The ultimate aim of conservative criticism is to achieve stability, so that things stay in the place where they belong, orderly and peacefully. This is logical, because it fits with the idea that human beings quite simply \\"are as they are\\" – and that this will never change. Resistance to this reality, the conservative feels, is not only useless, but also just makes people unhappy; \\"you can't change human nature\\". Conservative criticism can be effective, if it is feasible to keep things the way they are, or to return to a traditional way of doing things. It is usually not effective, if change is absolutely unavoidable and inevitable, or if it is impossible to go back to the way of doing things in the past. However, even if change cannot be avoided, there may be several different options for how to approach it, and conservative critics are then likely to choose a \\"conservative option\\". Liberal criticism Liberal criticism is primarily concerned with people's rights (including human rights) and freedoms, with whether people are taking responsibility for their choices or not, and with the limits of toleration. Liberal critics believe that: * Interests, needs, and rights of autonomous individuals are most important, not group entities (except if they are groups of recognizable individuals). * People should be free to make their own choices, and should take responsibility for those choices. * People should have equal opportunities in the marketplace. * People should be rewarded according to the merits of what they achieve, not according to their status, or inherited privileges. * People are entitled to a private sphere of their own, i.e., a distinction should be made between private and public life. Liberal criticism focuses on making sure that all the conditions exist in which individuals can develop, flourish and prosper successfully, as independent people, with a minimum of constraints. Liberals therefore criticize anything that gets in the way of this. People's rights, privacy and choices should be respected as much as possible, and obstacles to a free life should be attacked and removed. Liberals are in favour of pluralism: nobody has a monopoly on the truth, and other, different voices should be heard. At the same time, people should be prevented from interfering too much in other people's lives. If people make the wrong choices, or if they don't take responsibility for their own choices and their own lives, they should be criticized for that. If people are unfairly shut out from opportunities, or if they are unfairly rewarded, liberals often criticize it. Liberal criticism is associated especially with young adults who are starting to make their own way in life, on their own strength. Liberal criticism can often become extraordinarily complex and subtle, involving very fine distinctions. The reason is that the interests, rights and obligations of individuals constantly have to be weighed against the interests, rights and obligations of other individuals. Rules and principles have to be created so that individuals are not too constrained, but also that they are prevented from interfering unduly in the lives of others. People should be \\"free, but not too free\\". People are \\"too free\\" when they become irresponsible, anti-social and arbitrary, i.e., when they fail to regulate their own behaviour appropriately, and have to be regulated by others. Liberal criticism is therefore always very concerned with finding the right kind of balance, or the right nuance, which would (ideally) express a situation of harmony among individuals (or expresses the best way to regard something). Liberals accept that conflicts always occur, but conflicts should be kept within certain bounds, and methods should be found to resolve them fairly. Much liberal criticism is devoted to defining exactly \\"what should be tolerated and what should not be tolerated\\", and explaining why that is. *At its best, liberal criticism takes a \\"liberal\\" view of human beings, meaning that it is sufficiently open-minded to consider issues in a very comprehensive way, from all different angles. It allows people enough freedom to try out something new, tolerates differences of opinion, and lets people learn from their mistakes. *At worst, liberal criticism \\"misses the wood for the trees\\" because, by focusing on individuals and individual solutions, it overlooks the \\"bigger picture\\", or fails to understand the meaning of people's social coexistence. Liberals often cannot imagine anything beyond individuals, and therefore, when they have to describe the total situation in which individuals have to operate (social systems, macro-realities or collectivities), their perspective may become eclectic, fragmented or particularist. *Generally, liberal critics believe that the world would be better off if everyone is a liberal; but if they are driven into a corner by the criticisms of others, i.e., if they are robbed of their freedom in some sense, they can also become very anti-liberal and despotic – at least until such time as their own liberal way of being is tolerated again. *Liberal criticism typically does not work well, when the interests of the people concerned are mutually exclusive, and cannot be reconciled at all. Liberal criticism usually assumes that people are sufficiently flexible to be willing to discuss, negotiate or compromise about something, i.e., that people have an attitude of \\"give and take\\". Speculative criticism Speculative criticism is criticism which focuses on what something \\"might, could, or ought to\\" mean, or what \\"might, could, or ought to\\" follow from it. It might also focus on the \\"probable\\" or \\"likely\\" meaning of something, or the \\"probable\\" or \\"likely\\" consequences of it. Speculative criticism usually occurs in the absence of (enough) evidence that would decide an issue. It goes \\"beyond the facts\\", because the facts available (if any) are not conclusive. Thus, speculative criticisms usually occur when things are either not certain, definite or fixed (yet), or when multiple different meanings are possible. Since most people have to deal with some uncertainties in their daily lives, and have to interpret things without (yet) knowing the details of the full story, they entertain speculative thoughts as a normal everyday occurrence . For example, if somebody is thinking of buying a used car, he or she might think of what \\"might\\" be right or wrong with it, without knowing for sure. A speculative criticism often takes the form that \\"if we assumed such-and-such, then it would seem that a consequence (desirable or undesirable) would follow\\". Yet whether the assumption is valid, remains uncertain. Whether the inference made on the strength of the assumption is valid, may likewise be uncertain. The speculative critic imagines different positive and negative scenarios which could be applicable, if certain conditions are assumed to exist. Or, somebody might say, \\"intuitively I would object to such a statement\\", without definite grounds or reliable information being available. Something could be \\"plausible\\" (on the face of it, it makes sense), but not (yet) \\"provable\\". There could \\"probably\\" be something wrong with a thing or idea, without definite proof that it is wrong. Speculative criticism is often criticized precisely because it is speculative, i.e., because relevant evidence is unavailable, or because the criticism is made before \\"the evidence is in.\\" In this case, the criticism is considered to lack any solid basis. For example, politicians (or political commentators) might dismiss \\"speculative newspaper stories\\" because they believe that these stories are just \\"spin\\" based on gossip and hearsay, and not based on any \\"hard evidence\\". Nevertheless, speculative criticism can play an important role (e.g., in research, in art, in hermeneutics and in literary theory), because the same information can be \\"read\\" in different ways, and read in different ways by different people. What the information means, is in this case not fixed; it is open to interpretation, it has different meanings, and it may be, that what it means can only be established by interacting with the information. By means of speculative criticism, it is established what the information could possibly mean, perhaps as a prologue to more thorough verification. For example, when archaeologists find some very old bones, they might debate their hunches about the civilization of the people to whom the bones belonged. In all sorts of fields of human endeavour, it can be important and valuable to establish, through criticisms, what the possible significance of something is. Speculative criticism does not necessarily assume that things mean \\"anything you like\\". It may only be that the significance of something could be interpreted in a limited number of different ways. Speculative criticism can be useful and credible, if people have to evaluate situations where there are unknowns, uncertainties, novelties or different possibilities (see also brainstorming). It is not very credible, when a definite answer could easily be obtained, \\"if only\\" the speculative critics bothered to do a bit of thinking and fact-finding themselves, and if they verified the claims being made properly. Foolish criticism Foolish criticism is unclear about what the motive or purpose of the criticism is, or about what the consequence or effect of the criticism is. Usually it connotes lack of self-insight or a good understanding of the motives or issue involved. The foolish critic often mistakes what his target should be, and therefore, his criticism is really \\"at the wrong address\\", it is in some sense misplaced, disingenuous or misjudged (\\"clutching at straws\\", \\"tilting at windmills\\", \\"Red herring\\"). Foolish criticism is not necessarily arbitrary or willy-nilly, but it is \\"foolish\\", because it does the critic (or his intended target) no good. Typically it is therefore self-defeating, which might make people wonder why it is being stated at all. People can become terribly obsessed with a criticism, without really being aware of what it is truly about, why it is being made, or what the effect of it is. They might feel they should \\"pipe in\\" about an issue, without any awareness of a clear motivation. Foolish criticism may lack any clear direction, being prompted simply by a grudge or gripe, a feeling of unease, or a sense of dissatisfaction. People often say, \\"don't criticize, what you don't understand\\", meaning that first people should understand things and their effects properly, before launching into criticism. If they do not, the criticism might \\"backfire\\" and have an effect which is opposite to what is intended. Criticism is truly foolish, if people persist in a criticism regardless, even though it is demonstrably not well-taken. Foolish criticism is sometimes also interpreted as comical criticism (\\"critical foolery\\" or \\"fooling around with criticism\\") where the critic aims to entertain with his criticism. Foolish criticism usually means that the criticism and the critic are not taken seriously by people who understand what the issue is about; thus, the criticism may have no other effect than that it makes people laugh, shrug or feel annoyed. People may acknowledge that a criticism is \\"brave\\" (they credit the critic with the courage to make a criticism), but also that it is \\"foolish\\" (because, by making it, the critic sacrifices something important which he did not need to do). Professional criticism The term \\"professional criticism\\" is applied in several ways. *Criticism which is professionally done - this implies that it is expertly done, and could hardly be improved. That usually means that it is so well-designed, that nobody can deny it, and that people feel something necessarily has to be done about it. *Criticism which is offered by a professional, rather than an amateur or layman. Somebody may offer a criticism \\"in his professional capacity\\", meaning that he bases himself on his professional experience with the subject of the criticism. This does not, however, automatically mean that the criticism is good. *Somebody is being criticized, because he has flouted a professional standard. Normally, a skilled occupation or a profession has a set of standards, which aims to ensure the quality of work. If the standards were not there, the goods and services supplied would be shoddy, useless or unsafe. Professionals learn what the standard is, through training and education, and they explain relevant aspects of that standard to the people they supervise. The standards can include a code of ethics, rules for behaviour, technical norms and procedures, legal rules, etc. It is expected that people who work in a profession really follow the standards of that profession. If they do not, they can be criticized for this failure. In that case, their behaviour is regarded as \\"not professional\\" or \\"unprofessional\\". *The criticism of professionals or the criticism of a profession may occur, sometimes in a somewhat humorous, or satirical way. It could be done by professionals themselves, or by amateurs or laypersons. In this case, there is some skepticism about what the status of \\"being professional\\" actually adds to solving a problem, or there is skepticism about the claims made by a profession about how it can contribute to solving a problem. It is often implied here, that the standards of professionals do no justice to a specific situation, or that there is a case of professional cretinism: the professional gets it wrong, because he is unable to think outside of his own profession (he is imprisoned in a framework that does not lead to a solution). Not infrequently, some of these different senses of professional criticism are mixed together, especially when people try to pretend somebody's criticism is authoritative (they seem to have a professional expertise, although they really lack this expertise), or when people try to pretend that somebody's criticism is not authoritative (they are treated as no better than the rest, although in reality they are highly professional, and more competent and experienced than the rest). Self-criticism Self-criticism (or what academics sometimes call \\"autocritique\\") refers to the ability to appraise the pros and cons of one's own beliefs, thoughts, actions, behaviour or results, especially from the point of view of how others might regard them. The self- criticism might occur in private, or it might happen in a group discussion. Sometimes the self-criticism is aired publicly, specifically to show people that a person or group no longer believes in something which it formerly did; at other times, the self-criticism remains a hidden secret behind closed doors. Self-criticism requires a certain flexibility of mind, because it assumes a person is able to call into question his own behaviour and thinking – instead of believing that he \\"naturally\\" is the way he is, or that he can \\"never be wrong\\". Often it requires that people are able to \\"step outside themselves\\", and see themselves from a different perspective. The self-critic is willing to search for, recognize, and accept objections against his own behaviour, or his own characteristics; he is willing to accept that he could be wrong, or indeed that he is in the wrong. Self-criticism can be very difficult, for several reasons. *People can be very resistant to admitting they are wrong about something, or that they did (or said) the wrong thing. They like to believe they got it right, even when others disagree. Acknowledging that they got it wrong, could be very embarrassing, confusing or distressing – especially if they personally invested a lot in the wrong idea. Their whole world might crumble. *People might have \\"blind spots\\" in their awareness, i.e., they are simply unable to see a part of themselves for what it is (unless others point it out to them). In that case, they are unable to criticize themselves, because they don't know what there is to criticize. *If people did engage in self-criticism, others might interpret it as a sign of weakness (\\"you got it wrong, so why should I take you seriously?\\"). Thus, the self-critic might no longer have the same confidence, or become vulnerable to attack from others. Self-criticism is an essential component of learning. In order to be able to change one's behaviour, improve one's style, and adjust to a new situation, it is necessary to recognize personal errors as errors. Once the errors are known, something can be done about them; a different path can be pursued. One also needs to be able to tell the difference between success and failure, and not mistake one for the other. Only then is it possible to truly \\"learn from one's mistakes.\\" Often, the most challenging part is to know what exactly the mistake or success consists in. The aim of self-criticism is to find all that out, aided by memory. People sometimes say, \\"its about the criticism that gets me\\". This is especially true of self-criticism. Usually people are only prepared to criticize themselves within certain limits, otherwise it becomes confusing, disorienting, or even lethal. If a person arrives at the conclusion that most of what he is about is wrong, he can be plunged into a disorienting chaos, where he is unable to evaluate things properly anymore. Thus, while most people regard self-criticism as healthy, as a sign of good character, and as necessary for learning, excessive or enforced self-criticism is regarded as unhealthy (as destructive for the individual). The ultimate self-criticism can be a final self-attack through deliberate suicide. Suicidal persons are willing to give up their right to exist, they no longer believe their life is worth living. Thus, it is possible to be \\"too hard on oneself\\", leading to self-destructive behaviour.

Specifications *Overall Length Standard: 1140mm - Carbine (K): 1050mm. *Barrel Length Standard: 500mm - Carbine (K) : 410mm. *Weight (without scope) 3,8 to 4,0 kg. *Velocity 4,5 mm 230 m/s - 5,5 mm is 175 m/s (in 5.5mm caliber) Operation The HW (Hermann Weihrauch) 35 was the first air rifle with Weihrauchs famous Rekord 2-stage adjustable trigger and used a conventional piston and spring assembly. The spring is compressed by breaking the barrel through 125° before loading a pellet directly into the breach. The barrel was then returned into place and locked with a special Breech lock. The first production models had a leather piston seal with a 4mm diameter transfer port but at the end of the 1970s, Weihrauch switched to synthetic seals and a 2.8mm dia port from serial #843636. The rifle has \\"blued steel\\" finish on the metalwork, a beech or walnut sporting stock with finger grooves in the forend, checkering on the pistol grip and a rubber recoil pad. The 35 had an articulated cocking link that allowed the cocking slot on the underside of the stock to be shorter, an automatic safety catch and most models were fitted with sling swivels. The HW 35, being a spring-gun suffered with recoil and was quite noisy for an air rifle. Range was limited to about 35m, with 20-25m being the maximum realistic hunting range as the rifle was designed to produce only around 10.5 ft•lbf (14.5 Joules) of muzzle energy. ;Breech lock The HW 35 has a locking breech latch to ensure barrel alignment after cocking. The lock extends from the left side of the breech block where the shooters thumb slides it forward during cocking.HW35 – another golden oldie ;Sights The front iron sight is a globe with interchangeable inserts and the rear is a ramp style tangent, with a choice of four different shaped notches. At the rear of the action there's an 11 mm dovetail rail (older versions have 13mm) to mount a telescopic sight with two or three vertical holes for Weihrauch's own diopter target sight. Models The internal action on all 35s was identical but the rifle was available in three \\"custom\\" versions with varying degrees of aesthetic refinements and three different lengths of barrel. The HW 35 STD (Standard) has a beech stock while the HW 35L (DeLux) a Walnut finished one with a raised cheek piece. The top of the range was the HW 35E (Export) with a selected walnut stock, palm swell, rosewood pistol grip cap with a white line spacer and a 60mm longer barrel (the longer barrel did not increase power). Later this version also had a sound moderator on the muzzle. Both the Standard and the DeLux were available as a \\"K\\" for Karabiner (Carbine) style with a shorter barrel. ; Limited Edition Models In 1977 Weihrauch produced the HW 35 Lochschaft (HW 35LS Thumb-hole stock) version, then in 1986 the HW 35 Safari, a variant of the HW 35 standard with a green-tinged stock. Perhaps the most sought after by collectors is one of a limited run of 1000 .22 (5.5 mm) Jubilee 55 Edition (HW 35 KLS ) to celebrate 55 years of continuous production of the HW 35 in 2006. This model had a screw cut barrel with a sound moderator, a blue laminate stock, the action was engraved \\"Jubilee 55\\" in gold and came without open sights. Weihrauch also produces the HW 35 STL (Stainless Steel Look) with a black synthetic stock and nickel-plated action from around 2004. Some enterprising gunsmiths and importers often switch the actions from STL's with other HW 35 variants and marketed HW 35 STL's with Walnut stocks and traditionally blued actions with black synthetic stocks. ; The HW 35 Vixen Between 1979 and 1981, Norman May of Bridlington produced a specially tuned version for the UK market. The rifle had a chromed mainspring, piston, guide tube and breach lock with the logo 'VIXEN' engraved on the right of the barrel block. They came with a gun bag with an embroidered Vixen logo. In 1979 an HW 35E Vixen cost £170 when a standard HW 35 cost £57 and the Vixen was not a commercial success.

Background ETA had previously placed car bombs in Madrid, the deadliest being the Plaza República Dominicana bombing in July 1986, which had killed 12 Civil Guards. The Vallecas attack was the third of 1995. Earlier in the year, ETA had unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate José María Aznar, head of the People's Party and Leader of the Opposition, who had escaped death due to protection offered by his armoured car. In the second attack in June, ETA had killed a police officer, Jesus Robello. The Vallecas attack came just four days after a meeting of European Union heads of state had taken place in Madrid, marking the end of the Spanish Presidency of the EU. The attack ETA placed a car bomb, containing sixty kilos of amonal at one of the entrances to the motorway, through which army vehicles usually passed.La Vanguardia, 12 December 1995, p11 The military vehicle was transporting civilian employees to their homes, army housing located on Peña Prieta Street.

Sunil escapes from the police station and decides to confront Vishnu to prove his innocence. On the way, he realizes that no murder really occurred; police have laid a trap for him along with Vishnu to make him confess to Jeena's murder (which Sunil has in fact committed by actually pushing her down from the balcony as he could not tolerate her mental illness), and they are probably waiting for him at Vishnu's house to try to record him admitting his guilt as evidence and trap him. Sunil instead goes to the bus stand and escapes.

Scenarists Ranjith and A. K. Sajan were also approached for writing two of the films but they rejected. Anoop Menon, who scripted Gangs of Vadakkumnathan, was also initially reluctant to do the project. In an interview, he said, \\"I have been approached to write a part of D Company. But, right now, my hands are full and I haven't got time to sit and think about it.\\" Parvathy Nair was chosen to play the wife of the character played by Jayasurya. She had earlier been in news for rejecting an important role in the Jayasurya-starrer film Beautiful. Shaji Kailas's featurette Godse is based on the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The director says, \\"The movie is about the conflict of emotions and explores the turmoil that Godse goes through the night before he kills Mahatma Gandhi. It's basically the fight between the good and the evil. There is an intense struggle that Godse goes through before committing the crime. Finally, he does it, justifying it as God's wish.\\" The film has only a few characters and will be made as a soliloquy of Nathuram Godse, as he weighs the pros and cons of his deed. The film is inspired by the controversial book Freedom at Midnight by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre. According to the director, the film evolved from the final pages of the book, which describes what Godse went through before assassinating Gandhi. Godse will start filming as soon as Kailas finishes his project Madirasi. Veteran director Joshiy, who directed the film starring Mohanlal, first approached Kerala-borne Tamil actress Trisha to play the female lead. However, she opted out citing her busy schedules. However, some reports say that she demanded 40 lakhs, a large sum for a Malayalam film, and the director himself replaced her. Initially, each segments were planned to be named after colours such as Red, Blue, Green etc. but however this idea was later dropped. The stunt sequences are done by Mafia Sasi, Thyagarajan, Anal Arash and Kanal Kannan. Filming Oru Bolivian Diary 1995, the first short in the series, started its filming in May 2012 in Hyderabad. Its second schedule of filming started on 7 June and the film was shot extensively in Muthanga near Sultan Battery. Major parts were shot in about 10 days. Several locals from Wayanad district and about 20 police officers from the state police force were also part of the film. About the film, M. Padmakumar says, \\"It's an action film in the sense that an element of suspense is retained throughout and the film is essentially a thriller. It doesn't mean that the film is full of firearm fights and stunt sequences.\\" Gangs of Vadakkumnathan is the second film in the series. The segment began filming on 20 August 2012 and was shot from Thrissur, Bangalore and Mangalore. The third segment was titled Diya. Fahadh Faasil plays a doctor in the film. The shoot for Diya will start on 20 May. In June 2013, Bhama stated that she starred in the segment directed by Vinod Vijayan, where she is paired with Fahadh Faasil. Tanushree Ghosh said that she will portray the role of a trainee Assistant Commissioner of Police in Vinod Vijayan's featurette. Praveen B Menon was the production controller of this film.

Vijay Sardeshmukh, born in June 1952 was initiated into music by his Father, Vitthalrao Sardeshmukh. Vitthalrao was a Sanskrit pandit, a vocalist (disciple of Sureshbabu Mane of Kirana Gharana) and an accomplished harmonium player. He accompanied many vocalists of renown including Pt. Bhimsen Joshi, Pt. Kumar Gandharva and others. Kumar Gandharva, who was a good friend of Vitthalrao, later became Vijay's Guru. Vijay has learned from Kumar Gandharva 1971 onward. Gifted with a melodious voice, Vijay made his debut in \\"Swar sadhana Conference\\" organized in Pune in 1974. Since then he has performed in many concerts of repute, including the Sawai Gandharva and Tansen Samaroha. He is Graded Artist of All India Radio and Doordarshan since 1977. His cassettes and C D s are released by HMV and Alurkar Music House Pune. Amongst Pt. Kumar Gandharva's disciples, Vijay’s presentation is widely recognized as very close to that of his Guru. A meditative quality that prevailed in Kumar Gandharva's music can be richly experienced in Vijay's music. Kumar Gandharva's education always included singing as well as discussion. It was this fusion of thought process and music that Vijay inherited from Kumar Gandharva which prompted concerts like Kalyan Darshan and Tambe Geet Rajani. Vijay’s voice was molded further under Kumar Gandharv's guidance who was known to be well versed with the science of voice culture. Two Tanpuras, tuned to the highest degree of perfection, play a vital role in Vijay’s music. To quote Kumar Gandharva’s thought behind this, \\"This is our canvass, how can an artist paint in thin air ?\\" Drawing on the tanpuras, Vijayjee is known to make the air vibrant with various ragas with minutest of the Shruti differences. Thus entwined, Vijayjee points, in the minds of his audience. Known for his soft-spoken and modest nature Vijay is a man of few words but boundless music within him. Vijay Sardeshmukh is also a well-known Guru.

Kimble Silk Company, and Arrow Throwing Company, is a historic glassware factory and silk mill located at Hawley, Wayne County, Pennsylvania. With the waning of the canal and gravity rail operations in the late 19th century, Hawley developed into a busy manufacturing town. In addition to silk fabric and garments, among the chief products was fine cut glass. The leading cut glass establishment was that of John Sarsfield O’Connor (1831 - 1916) at the base of the Paupack Falls. The building was built on the site of previous mills of wood frame construction in 1890. The earliest of these dates back to the founding of the hamlet of Paupack Eddy, the forerunner of Hawley, in the closing decade of the 18th century. It is a three-story, 160 feet long and 44 feet wide, bluestone building in the Federal style, with an addition 40 by 75 feet. J.S. O’Connor Rich Cut Glass has been described as one of the most extensive glass cutting factories in America. O’Connor is recalled as one of the finest glass cutters in the nation. The factory was said to be one of its kind in America, run by water power and lit by electricity generated by its own electrical plant. The firm had a capacity of 250 cutting frames. John S. O'Connor erected this bluestone building for the purpose of manufacturing cut glass using Dorflinger blanks. The electricity used was generated from the Wallenpaupack Falls located directly behind the building. A 300-candle power dynamo was housed in the basement. The office, roughing and stockrooms were on the first floor; the second and third floors held the designing, smoothing and polishing departments. The factory was a well- orchestrated assembly-line operation. The \\"Brilliant Period\\" in glass cutting was between 1880 and 1905. and J.S. O'Connor designed many highly collectible patterns, such as Parisian, Florentine, and Princess. He also designed special cutting wheels for circular cuts, a vacuum device that prevented glasscutters from inhaling the ground glass, and a hardwood polisher. When the third floor was rebuilt, 50 cutting frames were added. This brought the workforce from 150 to nearly 200, and a new showroom was built. Another reference says that the workforce eventually reached almost 300. In 1900, J.S. O'Connor opened a second factory in Goshen, NY and on January 16th, 1902, J. S. O’Connor sold his Hawley plant, relocating from Hawley, PA to Goshen, NY. John S. O'Connor was born in Ireland in 1831 and came to America as a child. In his youth he was an apprentice in cut-glass factories in New York City. After serving in the Civil War, he was employed by Christian Dorflinger at White Mills. He received first prize for his cut-glass submission to the Paris Exposition. He died at his Hawley home, located next to his built factory, in 1916 at the age of 85. He is buried in a Honesdale, PA cemetery with his family. J.S.

It is influenced by the works of American-Canadian writer William Gibson such as Neuromancer and its plot is very reminiscent of The Matrix, which came three years later after the project was discontinued. The player would have follow the story about a group of three characters in a fictional United States city on the year 2042, as they performed multiple missions and tasks such as assassination, computer hacking, exploration, street fighting and other assignments along the way. Originally conceived internally in 1994 as an mascot platform game by Sam Tramiel to represent Atari Corp., it later evolved into a more mature title involving a cyberpunk setting. After multiple delays and expenses, Atari Corp. cancelled the game in 1996, a decision seen by the video game press as an indication that the company was preparing to stop support for the Jaguar, especially as one of the other games for the system, Thea Realm Fighters, was also cancelled at the same time, with the game being close to completion. Although unreleased, several playable prototypes have been released and sold online by people such as B.J. West, one of the original producers of the game and video game collector Clint Thompson, who got the rights to publish one of the playable prototypes.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot from the released Revision 18. Black ICE\\\\White Noise is an action- adventure game that is played from a third-person view, taking place in a three-dimensional environment similar to Grand Theft Auto III, with two- dimensional digitized sprites and polygonal hovercraft vehicles flying across the city. The players would have participated in missions, which were linear scenarios with set main objectives, to progress through the plot and earn money upon their completion in some cases. Outside the missions, the players could freely roam in the game's open world and would have the ability to perform jobs to earn money and complete optional side missions. The game takes place on the year 2042 in Loma Prieta, a fictional city situated in the Santa Clara Valley, California and it involves multiple streets and roads with multiple locations within the city. Players could walk, jump, run or call a taxicab hovercraft to navigate in the game's city. During combat, players can either fight unarmed or with weapons that can auto-aim against enemy gangsters. If the player shoots any kind of gun outside buildings, the police will respond immediately against the player but they can also be killed. Players can also enter inside buildings and shops to talk with other non- player characters to be either hired for an assignment or buy new items, equipment and weapons. There were going to be three playable characters in the final version of the game, two male and a female: Tyro, Crash and Misha, and each one would have their own set of skills and gear equipment but only Misha is playable in the released prototypes. Another gameplay element is the ability to enter into the C-Space cyberspace by the usage of a Deck item in real-time. Reminiscent of System Shock, players can freely explore the virtual space, but in the final version they would have the ability to hack vehicles, security systems, find hidden files and battle against other C-Space users.  History = Background and conception  B.J. West began working for Atari Corporation in June 1993, five months prior to the release of the Jaguar in North America and worked on various games for the system from 1993 to 1994 as a graphic artist and animator such as Club Drive, Cybermorph and Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy. After finishing his work on these games, Sam Tramiel and the executives at Atari Corp. had a SKU open for their next internal project but they did not have a set idea what it was going to be, with the team pitching multiple proposal ideas of varying genres, with the intention to create a mascot character to represent the company, similar to what Nintendo and Sega had with Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog, with one of the proposed characters being an alligator lawyer named Al E. Gator and among the furthest developed game pitches was a platform game starring an armadillo character titled Arlo Armadillo vs. The Bugs Below for the then-upcoming Jaguar CD. Faran Thomason, who was also one of the producers of the game, and B.J. West remarked that no one liked any of them and he proposed other game ideas after the platformer proposal was withdrawn. The team later came with the concept idea of a cyberpunk role-playing video game with influence from works of William Gibson that would later be titled Chaos Agenda, with B.J. West further backing the idea by creating with the internal team a design document and artwork, with Atari Corp. greenlighting it after realizing various focus tests with positive output.  Development  Black ICE\\\\White Noise was previewed in 1994 under the name Chaos Agenda and was one of the first games announced for the Jaguar CD, where it was originally advertised that players could travel between multiple cities. It kept being advertised and previewed under the same name until August 1995, where it was still listed as an upcoming game for the add-on but under its final name. Ken Rose, lead programmer of the game, also worked unofficially as one of the managers for the project.  Cast  In a forum thread post at Giant Bomb, an Atari employee recounted about the casting and filming process of the Black ICE\\\\White Noise's in-game characters. He stated that the team travelled to Los Angeles in order to film the game's playable characters and NPCs in a blue screen, similar to Mortal Kombat. Around thirty-four actors were cast for the game and among them are: * Michiko Nishiwaki as Misha, a japanese street samurai for hire. * Chris Hudak as Crash, an mirrorshaded alcoholic burnout. Chris previously worked as a writer for both Next Generation, Wired and online publications. * Michael Long as Tyro, an Arsenio Hall-esque hacker.  Audio  Originally, the team were in negotiations with American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails to compose the soundtrack for Black ICE\\\\White Noise, with his founder Trent Reznor showing interest in doing so but Atari Corp. offered a low amount of payment for the work and as a result, the deal did not happened. Instead the original soundtrack was created, composed and performed by Grammy award-nominee and former video game composer Andy Armer. Although it was never fully implemented into any of the released playable prototypes, it was officially released on CD by B.J. West under the label Kelp Entertainment. The game's sound effects were also never implemented into any of the released prototypes but have since been released by the defunct Jaguar Sector II website under a CD-ROM compilation for PC titled Jaguar Source Code Collection.  Cancellation  After various delays and expenses, Atari Corp. cancelled the title in 1996, a decision that was seen by the gaming press as an indication that the company was preparing to stop support for the system. Plans for a film adaptation were also in development but negotiations were quickly stopped due to Atari demanding a high sum of money for the film rights. The game's source code has become lost due to Atari leaving the video game market after the system's commercial failure.  Release  While Black ICE\\\\White Noise was never officially released by Atari Corporation, 23 playable revisions of the game are known to exist, with 20 of them being in the hands of a private video game collector, and three of them were officially sold by B.J. West, who owns the rights to the IP after Atari Corporation merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover on April 8, 1996.  Revisions 18 and 19  Previously available as a free download, it is the first official physical release of the game, can be played on any Jaguar CD unit since it is encrypted and it is also one of the more stable playable builds. It was also released by video game collector Clint Thompson under the label Ambient Distortions, with permission from B.J. West himself, as a limited edition of 50 copies which came with a manual, strategy guide and a map. Likewise, another build similar to revision 18 labeled \\"Revision 19\\" was also released by B.J. West.  Revision 23  A recently found playable revision and the last one before Atari Corp. cancelled the project. This build has elements not previously found in revision 18, however, some parts can potentially crash the game. Like revision 18, it is encrypted, making it playable on any Jaguar CD unit.

Early life and career Gibson was the son of naval officer Charles Gibson and Emmeline Mary Fletcher and was born on 3 March 1908. He studied at Mowden Preparatory School in Brighton before he was sent in 1921 to Haileybury and Imperial Service College for schooling and later joined the University of Cambridge. At Cambridge, he earned a half blue in fencing. He almost made it to the British Olympic Team. In 1929, he began his career as a professor in Chillon College, Switzerland, responsible for teaching pupils History and winter sports. While at the college, he became a member of the famed Swiss Alpine Club. When the college suffered due to economic downturn, Gibson went on to teach at Ripon Grammar School. He remained at Ripon from 1932 until 1936. It was at Ripon that he met Malcolm Hailey, 1st Baron Hailey, who encouraged him to apply to The Doon School in India which had newly opened for Indian boys. He applied to Doon and was offered the post of a housemaster. He joined Doon in January 1937 as the housemaster of Kashmir House. Apart from being a housemaster, he also taught Geography to Doon pupils. He took a brief leave while at Doon to fight in the Second World War for the Royal Indian Naval Reserve. Thereafter, he also served as Principal of the Joint Services Wing, which is now the National Defence Academy. As Principal, he gave a concrete shape to the academic and extra-curricular activities there and was fondly remembered by all, more so by the cadets undergoing training. Three of the first NDA Course cadets (Gen SF Rodrigues, Admiral L Ramdas and Air Chief Marshal NC Suri) who happened to become Chiefs of the three Services respectively around the same time, together paid a courtesy visit to him in Ajmer where he had settled. He stayed in Doon till 1953, before he was appointed as Principal of Mayo College, Rajasthan. He is widely credited to have brought Mayo College to national prominence. He remained in Mayo for 15 years till 1969. After retiring, he wrote extensively for the Alpine Journal and the Himalayan Club Journal. Mountaineering career highlights * 1937 – Gibson along with his Doon School colleague John Martyn climbed Bandarpunch with Tenzing Norgay, who later became the first man to climb Mount Everest. In Tenzing's autobiography, he mentions Gibson several times as \\"my old friend Mr. Gibson\\". * 1946 – Gibson was a member of the mountaineering enthusiasts at Doon along with Gurdial Singh, J.A.K. Martyn and R.L. Holdsworth. He was a member of many successful expeditions, including to Kamet and Trisul. * 1970-1973- Gibson served as President of the Indian mountaineering club called the Himalayan Club. He was also a member of the Alpine Club. Honours and distinctions Gibson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 1960, and in 1965 received Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian award in India, from the Government of India for his contributions towards education. It was a rare achievement to have been honoured by both the governments.

The season consisted of 13 episodes. The series is based on the original Australian series, Wilfred, and stars Elijah Wood, Jason Gann, Fiona Gubelmann and Dorian Brown.  Synopsis  The second season begins 4 months after Season 1 ended, where Ryan is dreaming that he is in a mental hospital, and Wilfred is in a wheelchair. After an outburst, the doctor attempts to give Ryan electroshock therapy, having received permission from Ryan's dad. Wilfred saves Ryan, and Ryan wakes up in a meeting at his new job. He rushes out of the meeting and runs to the basement door to read Wilfred's will. He removes everything from the closet and destroys the wall to reveal the basement. Wilfred's will turns out to be blank, except for the words \\"Keep Digging\\". Meanwhile, Wilfred and Drew come back from Wisconsin, unusually close, and reveal that Jenna and Drew are getting married. Wilfred tells Ryan that he is selfish, and won't listen to him, until Drew attempts to give Wilfred steroids to win a dog challenge. After Wilfred loses, Drew makes fun of him, and Ryan and Wilfred become friends again. Ryan's now-pregnant sister returns from India, and Ryan discovers a restraining order against her from Arturo Ramos, the father of her unborn child. Ryan attempts to have a dinner party with Jenna, Drew, and his co-worker, Amanda, whom he begins dating. Amanda appears odd around Wilfred, and after Wilfred and Bear ruin the dinner party, Amanda reveals that she discovered her Grandfather's two dogs consuming his deceased body, causing her fear of dogs. Amanda and Wilfred become close after he consoles her. After several weeks of dating, Ryan tells Amanda that he loves her, and they decide to move in together. After spending a night in the basement, playing a pointless game all night with Wilfred and Bruce, Ryan breaks up with Amanda. Afterwards, the company that Ryan works for loses all its investors, and his boss commits suicide. Ryan and his mother go on a road-trip, against her doctor's orders, after her cat, Mittens, passes away. After Ryan's sister shows up to retrieve Ryan and their mentally ill mother, she goes into labor, giving birth to a boy who she names Joffrey. Jenna's career becomes a joke after her freak-out on live TV goes viral, and Wilfred finally convinces Ryan to come clean to her. Meanwhile, when Wilfred becomes jealous of the attention Jenna gives to the other neighborhood dogs, he accidentally pushes Drew's hunting shotgun over, which shoots Drew in the leg, days before his and Jenna's wedding, and Ryan offers to host the ceremony in his backyard for them. Ryan realizes that he is sad and misses Amanda, so he gets back together with her. At Drew and Jenna's, Ryan discovers that Amanda sold the formula that the company they were working for was creating, in hopes to run off with Ryan, and that she thinks that she can communicate with Wilfred, but cannot tell Ryan what Wilfred says to him. Amanda is taken to a mental hospital, and Wilfred finds a picture that Ryan drew as child that appears to have Wilfred in the background. Wilfred claims he drew the picture, and Ryan believes him until he sees a photo of himself as a child with the drawing, which has Wilfred in the background.

The riots started came after weeks of sectarian disputes including a gang rape and murder of a Rakhine woman by Rohingya Muslims. On 8 June 2012, Rohingyas started to protest from Friday's prayers in Maungdaw township. More than a dozen residents were killed after police started firing. State of emergency was declared in Rakhine, allowing military to participate in administration of the region. As of 22 August, officially there had been 88 casualties – 57 Muslims and 31 Buddhists. An estimated 90,000 people were displaced by the violence. About 2,528 houses were burned; of those, 1,336 belonged to Rohingyas and 1,192 belonged to Rakhines. Rohingya NGOs have accused the Burmese army and police of playing a role in targeting Rohingya through mass arrests and arbitrary violence though an in-depth research by the International Crisis Group reported that members of both communities were grateful for the protection provided by the military. While the government response was praised by the United States and European Union, NGOs were more critical, citing discrimination of Rohingyas by the previous military government. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and several human rights groups rejected the President Thein Sein's proposal to resettle the Rohingya abroad. Fighting broke out again in October, resulting in at least 80 deaths, the displacement of more than 20,000 people, and the burning of thousands of homes. Rohingyas are not allowed to leave their settlements, officially due to security concerns, and are the subject of a campaign of commercial boycott led by Buddhist monks. Background Rohingya people in Rakhine State Sectarian clashes occur sporadically in Rakhine State, often between the Buddhist Rakhine people who are majority in the southern part, and Rohingya Muslims who are majority in the north. Before the riots, there were widespread and strongly held fears circulating among Buddhist Rakhines that they would soon become a minority in all of Arakan, and not just the northern part, which has long been a Muslim majority. The Burmese government classifies the Rohingya as \\"immigrants\\" to Burma and denies them full citizenship. Due to their lack of citizenship, they were previously subject to restrictions on government education, officially recognised marriages, and along with ethnic Rakhines, endured forced labour under the military government. On the evening of 28 May, three Muslim youths apparently robbed, raped and murdered an ethnic Rakhine woman, Ma Thida Htwe, near her village Tha Pri Chaung when she was returning home from Kyauk Ni Maw Village of Rambree township. The locals claimed that the culprits were Rohingya Muslims. The police arrested three suspects and sent them to Yanbye township jail. On 3 June, a mob attacked a bus in Taungup, apparently mistakenly believing those responsible for the murder were on board. Ten Muslims were killed in the attack, prompting protests by Burmese Muslims in the commercial capital, Yangon. The government responded by appointing a minister and a senior police chief to head an investigation committee. The committee was ordered to find out \\"cause and instigation of the incident\\" and to pursue legal action. As of 2 July 30 people had been arrested over the killing of the Muslims. June 2012 riots The June 2012 riots saw various attacks by Buddhist Rakhines and Rohingya Muslims on each other's communities, including destruction of property. 8 June: Initial attacks Despite increased security measures, at 3:50 pm 8 June, a large mob of Rakhine ignited several houses in Bohmu Village, Maungdaw Township where 80% of the population is Rohingya Muslims. Telephone lines were also damaged. By the evening, Hmuu Zaw, a high-ranking officer, reported that the security forces were protecting 14 burnt villages in Maungdaw township. Around 5:30, the forces were authorised to use deadly force but they fired mostly warning shots according to local media. Soon afterward, authorities declared that the situation in Maungdaw Township had been stabilised. However, three villages of southern Maungdaw were torched in early evening. At 9 o'clock, the government imposed curfew in Maungdaw, and forbidding any gathering of more than five persons in public area. An hour later, the rioters had a police outpost in Khayay Mying Village surrounded. The police fired warning shots to disperse them. At 10 o'clock, armed forces had taken positions in Maungdaw. Five people had been confirmed killed as of 8 June. 9 June: Riots spread On the morning of 9 June, five army battalions arrived to reinforce the existing security forces. Government set up refugee camps for those whose houses had been burned. Government reports stated that Relief and Resettlement Ministry and Ministry of Defense had distributed 3.3 tons of supplies and 2 tons of clothes respectively. Despite increased security presence, the riots continued unabated. Security forces successfully prevented rioters' attempt to torch five-quarters of Maungdaw. However, Rakhine villagers from Buthidaung Township (where 90 percent of people are Rohingya Muslims) arrived at refugee camps after their houses had been razed by Muslims. Soon after, soldiers took positions and anti-riot police patrolled in the township. The Muslim rioters marched to Sittwe and burned down three houses in Mingan quarter. An official report stated that at least 7 people had been killed, one hostel, 17 shops and over 494 houses had been destroyed as of 9 June. 10 June: State of emergency On 10 June, a state of emergency was declared across Rakhine. According to state TV, the order was given in response to \\"unrest and terrorist attacks\\" and \\"intended to restore security and stability to the people immediately.\\" President Thein Sein added that further unrest could threaten the country's moves toward democracy. It was the first time that the current government used the provision. It instigated martial law, giving the military administrative control of the region. The move was criticised by Human Rights Watch, who accused the government of handing control over to a military which had historically brutalised people in the region. Some ethnic Rakhine burned Rohingya houses in Bohmu village in retaliation. Over five thousand people were residing at refugee camps by 10 June. Many of the refugees fled to Sittwe to escape the rioting, overwhelming local officials. 12–14 June On 12 June, more buildings were set ablaze in Sittwe as many residents throughout Rakhine were relocated. \\"Smoke is billowing from many directions and we are scared,\\" said one ethnic Rakhine resident. \\"The government should send in more security forces to protect [our] communities.\\" An unnamed government official put the death toll at 25 to date. The number of casualties were officially revised to 21 on 13 June. A top United Nations envoy visited the region affected by the riots. \\"We're here to observe and assess how we can continue to provide support to Rakhine [State],\\" said Ashok Nigam, UN humanitarian coordinator. The envoy later remarked that army appeared to have restored order to the region. Meanwhile, Bangladeshi authorities continued to turn away refugees, denying another 140 people entry into Bangladesh. To date at least 15 boats and up to 1,500 total refugees had been turned away. Dipu Moni, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, said at a news conference in the capital, Dhaka, that Bangladesh did not have the capacity to accept refugees because the impoverished country's resources already are strained. The UN called on Bangladesh to reconsider. On 14 June, the situation appeared calm as casualty figures were updated to 29 deaths – 16 Muslim and 13 Buddhists according to Myanmar authorities. The government also estimated 2,500 homes had been destroyed and 30,000 people displaced by the violence. Thirty-seven camps across Rakhine housed the refugees. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi warned that violence would continue unless \\"the rule of law\\" was restored.  15–28 June: Fatality figures update and arrest of UN workers  As of 28 June, casualty figures were updated to 80 deaths and estimated 90,000 people were displaced and taking refuge in temporary camps according to official reports. Hundreds of Rohingyas fled across the border to Bangladesh, though many were forced back to Burma. Rohingyas who fled to Bangladesh also claimed that the Burmese army and police shot groups of villagers after they started the riot. They stated they feared to return to Burma when Bangladesh rejected them as refugees and asked them to go back home. Despite the claims made by NGOs, an in-depth research by the International Crisis Group reported that members of both communities were grateful for protection provided by the military. The Government of Myanmar arrested 10 UN UNHCR workers and charged three with \\"stimulating\\" the riots.UN aid workers face Myanmar riot charges, By Gwen Robinson in Bangkok, 15 July 2012, Financial Times António Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, visited Yangon and asked for the release of the UN workers which Myanmar's President Thein Sein said he would not allow but asked if the UN would help to resettle up to 1,000,000 Rohingya Muslims in either refugee camps in Bangladesh or some other country. The UN rejected Thein Sein's proposal.  October riots  Violence between Muslims and Buddhists broke out again in late October. According to the Burmese government, more than 80 people were killed, more than 22,000 people were displaced, and more than 4,600 houses burnt. The outburst of fighting brought the total number of displaced since the beginning of the conflict to 100,000. The violence began in the towns of Min Bya and Mrauk Oo by the Muslims, but spread across the state. Though the majority of Rakhine state's Muslims are Rohingya, Muslims of all ethnicities were reported to be targets of the violence in retaliation. Several Muslim groups announced that they would not be celebrating Eid al-Adha because they felt the government could not protect them. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon issued a statement on 26 October that \\"the vigilante attacks, targeted threats and extremist rhetoric must be stopped. If this is not done ... the reform and opening up process being currently pursued by the government is likely to be jeopardised.\\" US State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland called on the Burmese government to halt the violence and allow aid groups unrestricted access. On 27 October, a spokesperson for Thein Sein acknowledged \\"incidents of whole villages and parts of the towns being burnt down in Rakhine state\\", after Human Rights Watch released a satellite image showing hundreds of Muslim buildings destroyed in Kyaukpyu on Ramree Island. The United Nations reported on 28 October that 3,200 more displaced people had fled to refugee camps, with an estimated additional 2,500 still in transit. In early November, Doctors Without Borders reported that pamphlets and posters were being distributed in Rakhine State threatening aid workers who treated Muslims, causing almost all of its local staff to quit.  Misleading photographs in the media  Alleged photographs of crimes against Muslims perpetrated by Buddhists in Rakhine State had been widely circulated during and after the riots. Some of the photos were taken from natural disasters, such as pictures of Tibetan Buddhist monks cremating earthquake victims from the 2010 Yushu earthquake, mislabeled as Burmese monks burning Muslims alive. These were often circulated through facebook, a popular social media website in Myanmar.  Aftermath = Expulsion of Muslims from Sittwe  After the riots, most of the Muslims from Sittwe were removed by security forces into makeshift refugee camps well away from the city, towards Bangladesh. Only few hundred households were left in the ghetto-like Mingalar Ward where they are confined, officially due to security concerns. Rakhine Buddhists are calling for further internment and expulsion of Rohingya Muslims towards Bangladesh or the Bay of Bengal who cannot prove three generations of legal residence - a large part of the nearly one million Muslims from the state.  Rohingya diaspora  Around 140,000 people, the majority of them Rohingya Muslims, were displaced by two waves of organized violence between Buddhists and Muslims in Rakhine last year that left some 200 people dead. Thousands of Rohingya have fled Myanmar since then on overcrowded boats to Malaysia or further south, despite the dangers posed by rough seas. Hundreds are believed to have died at sea in 2013. In May, nearly 60 Rohingyas went missing after their boat sank after hitting rocks as a cyclone approached the bay. In November, another boat carrying 70 Rohingyas fleeing sectarian violence capsized off the western coast of Myanmar. Only eight survivors have been found. According to The Economist, later Burmese Buddhist mob violence against Rohingya Muslims in such places as Meiktila, Okpho and Gyobingauk Township \\"follows on from, and is clearly inspired by, the massacres of Rohingya Muslims around Sittwe\\"https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21574506-sectarian-violence-was- not-supposed-be-part-myanmars-bright-new-direction-when-lid-blows Communal violence in Myanmar: When the lid blows off and \\"now seems to be spreading to other parts of Asia, too\\".https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21582321-fuelled-dangerous-brew- faith-ethnicity-and-politics-tit-tat-conflict-escalating Buddhism v Islam in Asia: Fears of a new religious strife  Investigation  An investigation committee was formed on 28 March 2014 by the Burmese government to take action against the people involved in riots on 26 and 27 March 2014. The report on riots was to have been submitted by 7 April 2014 to the president. International reactions On 5 April 2013, Muslim and Buddhist inmates at an immigration detention centre Indonesia rioted along the lines of the conflict in their home country leading to death of 8 Buddhists and 15 injuries of Rohingyas. According to the testimonies of Rohingya witnesses, the reason that sparked the riot was because of sexual harassment against female Rohingya Muslim inmates by the Burmese Buddhist inmates. Indonesian court jailed 14 Muslim Rohingya for nine months each in December. The sentence was lighter than the maximum penalty for violence resulting in death, which is 12 years. The men's lawyer said they would appeal for freedom because there was no real evidence shown during the trial. India A Rohingya refugee colony gradually grew in New Delhi, as Bangladeshi refugees and Rohingya refugees settled here. By 2018, the colony had grown to more than 30,000 people. In August 2012, about 20,000 Indians, mostly Muslims gathered in Mumbai's Azad Maidan to protest the treatment of Rohingyas in Rakhine state. The protest, called by regional Muslim organizations and political parties quickly grew violent. Protesters began to riot and set fire to the offices and establishments in the vicinity. The police was outnumbered and the riots continued for 5 days. The riots started off initially as a protest organized in Azad Maidan on 11 August 2012 to condemn the Rakhine riots and Assam riots, which later turned into a riot. The riot reportedly began as the crowd got angry either after hearing an inflammatory speech or after seeing photographs of Assam violence and Rakhine state riots. The riot resulted in two deaths and injuries to 54 people including 45 policemen. Mumbai Police estimated that the riots caused a loss of 2.74 crore in damages to public and private property.

In April 2013, he openly criticised Buddhist monks' attacks on Muslims in Myanmar saying \\"Buddha always teaches us about forgiveness, tolerance, compassion.

Early life and education Prince Nasser was born in Riyadh in 1911. There are other reports, giving his birth date as 1913 and as 1921. He was the sixth son of Ibn Saud. His mother was Bazza I, a Moroccan woman. Prince Nasser had no full-brothers or full- sisters. He received education in Riyadh at the school of the palace, learning Quran, horsemanship and war techniques. Riyadh governorship In 1938, Ibn Saud appointed him as the governor of Riyadh Province. However, he had to resign from his post due to an event, leading to death of one of his brothers and others. When Prince Nasser was the governor, he organized a party after which his brother Prince Mansour, then-defense minister, and several foreigners died of alcohol poisoning. Upon hearing of this event, Ibn Saud threw him in jail. Subsequently, Nasser bin Abdulaziz lost his post and never returned to public life. Exclusion from succession Prince Nasser was excluded from the succession to throne because of the incident occurred during his term as the Governor of Riyadh Province. Both Nasser and Prince Saad were older than Prince Fahd when the latter was appointed crown prince in 1975. However, the supersession did not cause turmoil because both of them were regarded as weak contenders due to being relatively less experienced. Furthermore, Prince nasser lost his chance due to \\"dissolute\\" mores. He was regarded as unsuitable for succession by the larger family. His lack of accomplishment and low birth (his mother was a woman of colour from Morocco) were also factors leading to his exclusion. Personal life One of his wives, Muhdi bint Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Sudairi, was the younger sister of his step-mother, Hassa, who was one of Ibn Saud's wives and the mother of seven influential sons, known as the Sudairi Seven. Muhdi was the younger sister of Hassa bint Ahmad Al Sudairi. Naseer and Muhdi had five sons: Prince Khalid, Prince Abdullah, Prince Fahd, Prince Turki and Prince Ahmed. One of Naseer's sons, Turki bin Nasser, is a former military officer and the former head of the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment (PME). Another son, Mohammed bin Nasser, is the governor of Jizan Province. Another son Mansour bin Nasser was one of King Abdullah's advisors. Yet another son, Abdulaziz bin Nasser, is a businessman and the father of Saud bin Abdulaziz who murdered his servant in London in 2010. Abdullah bin Nasser, another son of Prince Nasser, was the president of Saudi football club Al Hilal in the 1970s. Death Prince Nasser could not walk and used a wheelchair in his last years. He died on 15 September 1984 and was buried in Riyadh. Legacy His family founded Prince Nasser bin Abdulaziz Center for Autism, an affiliated body of the Saudi Autism Center; the center was opened in April 2012.

Based on a story by Patricia Harper, the film is about a singing cowboy who goes up against a gang of outlaws who are looking to steal the valuable helium gas beneath the cowboy's ranch.Magers, pp. 124–125. Plot Ranch foreman Gene Autry (Gene Autry), his sidekick Frog Milhouse (Smiley Burnette), and the rest of the men at the Circle J ranch are anxious about the new owner, Van Fleet, who recently purchased the property. While awaiting his arrival, they learn that outlaws are searching for a helium gas floe on the property—gas they can sell to foreign powers for use in dirigibles, which are banned by the United States government. After one of the ranch hands is attacked, Gene and Frog go after the outlaws. At an abandoned house near the trail they find old Dad Haskell (Frank Darien), who tells Gene that his daughter Betty (Jean Rouverol) believes that he is the owner of the Circle J and is due to arrive from the east. Gene agrees to help maintain his charade and turns the Circle J into a dude ranch until the real owner arrives. When Betty arrives with her fiancé, Walter Gregory (George Walcott), and his mother (Margaret Armstrong), Gene pretends to save her from Frog who poses as an Indian. She gets angry at Gene when she finds out it is just a gag. That night, Betty tells her father that Mrs. Gregory allowed her to charge $1,500 worth of clothing to her account, and she needs to pay the money back soon. The next day, while continuing to track the outlaws, Gene decides to follow Betty when she goes for a ride and they accidentally discover the source of the helium. The outlaws, who have been following Gene, also now know the location of the gas floe. One of the gang tries to purchase the ranch from Dad, thinking that he is the owner, he refuses, making Walter and his mother suspicious. Mrs. Gregory then decides to get the $1,500 directly from Dad, who writes her a bad check to settle the debt, thinking he can win the money back from her at cards. Meanwhile, Gene grows suspicious of Randolph Kimball (Ben Hewlett), the chemist who once told the previous owner of the Circle J that the gas on the property was worthless. When Van Fleet finally arrives at his ranch, he is taken and tied up by Frog and ranch hand Joseph Frisco who want to keep him out of the way. Not knowing about their intentions, Gene comes across the incensed owner and frees him. After Doc Trimble (Harry Holman) wins enough money at cards to cover Dad's check, Van Fleet shows up and angrily throws everyone off of his ranch, including Walter and his mother, who want nothing more to do with Betty and Dad. While watching Frog blowing up balloons, Gene gets an idea and decides to fill an aeronautical balloon with helium and send Frog up in a basket. From the sky, Frog discovers the pipeline to the outlaws' cave, and after Gene uses a bullet to puncture Frog's balloon, they head towards the hideout. Following a shootout with the gang, Gene captures most of the outlaws and apprehends Kimball as he attempts to escape in a truck. Impressed with Gene's initiative, Van Fleet offers him the position of ranch manager, and Betty decides that Gene would make a much better husband than her former fiancé.Magers p. 125.

In south-west Germany, during the aftermath of World War II, five destitute siblings must travel to their grandmother's home by the Bay of Husum near Hamburg after their high-level Nazi parents disappear in danger of arrest by Allied occupation authorities. Along the way, they encounter a variety of other Germans, some of whom are helpful while others are antagonistic. Eventually they meet up with a young man presenting himself as Thomas, a young Jewish concentration camp survivor, who joins their group and becomes their unofficial guardian. Plot The return of a Nazi officer father towards the end of World War II upsets a family household in Southern Germany. They pack in a rush, kill the family dog and flee their stately home to hide-out in a secluded cabin in a clearing in the woods in the Black Forest. Lore's mother carefully wraps a porcelain figurine of a deer to take with them. Lore's father leaves for destinations unknown and with the news of the death of Adolf Hitler, her mother is aware of the fact she will be arrested too and goes off to a camp voluntarily, abandoning her five children and leaving Lore in charge with instructions to go to her grandmother's (Omi) house in Husum near Hamburg. Before leaving, Lore's mother gives her all of her jewellery and some money for the train tickets. After the neighbors are no longer willing to sell them any food, Günther is caught stealing so Lore decides it's time to leave. Unfortunately the trains are no longer running so they have to leave all their belongings behind and start their journey on foot. The children arrive at the ruins of an abandoned house and Lore discovers the dead body of a woman. She goes into the house to look for her brother Günther and stumbles upon a young man sleeping. The next day they arrive at a church and Lore pays a woman to breast-feed her baby brother Peter. They again run into the young man from the day before. News and photos of the atrocities committed at the Nazi concentration camps are posted on a wall in the center of the nearby village for all to see. Lore looks at the photos intently and recognizes her father in a Nazi officer's uniform. That evening, they move on to stay the night in a school. They encounter the same young man on his own who later makes a sexual advance on Lore but is rebuffed. The next day he follows them out of the town as they continue on their journey. Arriving at a farm, Lore gives a gold bracelet and her mother's gold ring to an old woman in exchange for food. Lore finds the body of a dead man who shot himself and steals his watch. The old woman begs Lore to leave the baby behind so others will give them food but she refuses and they leave. While walking, Lore again runs into the same man. She keeps on walking and he follows them. A truck with American soldiers drives up and stops. When asked for identification, the young man says his name is \\"Thomas\\" and shows the soldiers his Jewish identification papers and says he is Lore's brother. We see he has a serial number from a concentration camp tattooed on the inside of his forearm. The Americans give them a lift. The next day Lore falls ill and Thomas provides food for all of them. While bathing, Liesel questions why Lore doesn't like Thomas. Later Lore approaches Thomas, takes his hand and has him fondle her. When he lays his head against her legs she pushes him away. The following day while walking in the forest, Lore buries the picture of her father and the picture of him at the concentration camp. They continue walking and reach a river they cannot cross. Thomas offers to go across with Peter. Lore says he'll go across and leave the rest of them. Lore goes down a hill and finds a man with a row-boat. She asks him for help but he is not interested. She then sees Thomas on the road behind the man, so she allows the man to make sexual advances on her to distract him. Thomas hits the man over the head with a rock and kills him. Lore is visibly shaken. They take the man's boat and cross the river but while climbing the river bank Lore is guilt-stricken and backs into the river with Peter in her arms. Thomas pulls them both out and takes Peter from Lore's arms and hands him to Liesel. Upon reaching the British sector, they are denied passage and must remain in the Soviet sector. Lore asks Thomas if he told the soldiers what they did and he pulls her back from the guards. They decide they will cross into the British sector at night so they can catch one of the trains that are running there. After walking at night in the forest they pitch camp. When they smell somebody cooking, Thomas tells them to stay put and goes off to investigate. A restless Günther sees a man returning and believing it to be Thomas, runs towards him but is shot and killed by Soviet soldiers. Thomas then threatens he will leave them behind unless they keep moving on with him. During an argument with Lore, Thomas says he can't help them any more and that they can take the train and reach their destination safely. Lore is afraid he will leave them and in her anger and frustration calls him a filthy Jew. She cries and breaks down, so he decides to stay. They manage to board a train but are stopped by soldiers that ask for their papers. Thomas finds he is missing his wallet with his identity papers so he steps off the train to avoid getting caught. During the final leg of the trip along the muddy tidal plains of the western coast of the Jutland Peninsula, Jürgen confesses that he actually stole Thomas' wallet so he wouldn't abandon them and that the papers weren't his anyway, but belonged to someone else called Thomas Weil, who Thomas had been impersonating. The four remaining siblings finally arrive at Omi's house. She takes them in, feeds them and lectures them to not ever be ashamed of their parents. She mistakes Jürgen for Günther, and they tell her Günther died in the Soviet sector. Lore goes to her bedroom, which was her mother's when she was a child, and places her mother's porcelain figurine of the deer on the dresser, next to a collection of similar figurines. Lore finds it difficult to adjust and refuses to cheerfully dance to American music with Liesel in the kitchen. She goes for a walk in the woods and looks at the identity papers and family pictures of Thomas Weil in Thomas's wallet. Back at the house, they are sitting at the dining table when Jürgen impulsively grabs a piece of bread. Omi scolds him for not waiting to be served by the housekeeper and asks him whether he has ever learned anything at all. Lore is angered by her grandmother's authoritarianism so, siding with her brother, she also grabs a piece of bread without asking, bites into it and intentionally knocks over her glass of milk, pushes the milk off the table into the palm of her hand and drinks the milk. Omi excuses her from the table. Lore goes back to her room, throws the porcelain figurines off the dresser onto the floor and crushes them one by one with her heel.

When the director Cate Shortland joined the project she re-wrote part of the screenplay to make it fit her way of working. At a later stage, it was agreed that most of the dialogue should be in German, which delayed the production for a year and forced one of the British funding institutions to back out, as its rules didn't allow backing of non-English language films.Scriptangel's Blog, 2 July 2013: Screenwriter Interview – Robin Mukherjee Linked 2015-12-09 Release The film was first shown at the Sydney Film Festival on 9 June 2012, followed by the Festival del film Locarno on 2 August, where it won the Piazza Grande audience award, the Prix du public UBS.\\"Lore\\", Locarno Film Festival 2012 accessed 14 November 2012 It was then shown at a large number of film festivals around the world.IMDb: Lore - Release Info Linked 2015-12-09 At the Stockholm International Film Festival, in November, the film was awarded four awards, including the Bronze Horse for best film. It was selected as the Australian entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. It was released on cinema in Australia on 20 September 2012, in Germany on 1 November 2012, and in France, Belgium, United Kingdom and Ireland in February 2013, when it also saw a limited release in the United States. Critical reception Lisa Schwarzbaum, reviewer for Entertainment Weekly, gave the film a B+ and wrote, \\"This striking, slow-building drama from Cate Shortland (Somersault) uses fractured, impressionistic imagery as a mirror of moral dislocation as the children make their way through an unfamiliar landscape. If everything Lore (Saskia Rosendahl, capturing teen-girl sullenness) has been taught is wrong--about Hitler, about Jews, about the glory of her Vaterland, she might as well be walking on the moon.\\" Shane Danielsen of SBS awarded the film four stars out of five, commenting that \\"Beautiful, it may be, but it is by no means a bourgeois film...it is a rebuke to notions of middle-class propriety, as well as a formidable work in its own right.\\" Awards Lore received the Feature Film Production of the Year Award at the 2013 Screen Producers Australia Awards.

Marechal Tito Avenue The arrival of the Central do Brasil Railroad improved transport connections with São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, but road travel remained very difficult. In 1908 it took the French motorist Conde Lesdain (Comte de Lesdain) 45 days to complete the journey between the two cities by car. Under his slogan \\"to govern is to open roads\\", Washington Luís, Mayor of São Paulo (1914–1919), Governor of the State of São Paulo (1920–1924) and President of the Republic (1926–1930), encouraged the expansion of the urban highways network, largely following the pattern laid down during the colonial era. In 1922 he opened the São Paulo-Rio Highway, following one of the traditional colonial era routes and passing through São Miguel Paulista, Itaim Paulista and Mogi das Cruzes en route to Jacareí. In 1928 when the road was fully opened the journey took 10 hours. The present name is given in tribute of the President of Yugoslavia who died in 1980. Today the Avenida Marechal Tito is the main thoroughfare of São Miguel, lined by impressive buildings and serving all the town's most important facilities and attractions. The former diamond-shaped paving blocks have now been replaced by an asphalt surface.

He was a member of the Kastrioti family. George's father was John Castriot (an Ottoman vassal since 1385) and mother Vojsava Tripalda. Skanderbeg's parents had nine children, of whom he was the youngest son, his older brothers were Stanisha, Reposh and Kostandin, and his sisters were Mara, Jelena, Angjelina, Vlajka and Mamica. 1409 * John Castriot sent his eldest son, Stanisha, to be the Sultan's hostage. 1423 * John Castriot sent George as a hostage to the sultan's court. * Skanderbeg was circumcised. * George soon won the Sultan's confidence and was treated by Murad like his own son and promoted him to the high ranks in the Ottoman Army. '1423'1426 * Ottomans gave Skanderbeg a military education in Enderun in Edirne. 1426 * The First act of Hilandar emerged as a document written on Serbian language and Cyrillic script which is the first written document that contains the name of George Kastriot. * In period between 1426 and 1431 John Castriot and his three sons (Stanisha, Reposh and George) purchased four adelphates (rights to reside on monastic territory and receive subsidies from monastic resources) to the Saint George tower of Hilandar and to some property within the monastery as stated in the Second Act of Hilandar. 1428 * Stefan Maramonte went to Ottoman court and met Skanderbeg there. * Based on the Ottoman graduation system (), the sultan granted Skanderbeg a timar. This timar was near to the territories controlled by his father Gjon Kastrioti (). * April — John Castriot sent a letter to Venice in which he had explained his concerns that his son Skanderbeg would probably be ordered by the sultan to occupy his territory. * John Castriot had to seek forgiveness from the Venetian Senate because of Skanderbeg's participation in Ottoman military campaigns against Christians. 1430 * John Castriot was defeated in a battle by the Ottoman governor of Skopje, Isa bey Evrenos and as a result, his territorial possessions were extremely reduced. * Skanderbeg gained the title of sipahi because of his merits in expeditions of Murad II. 1431 * July 31Skanderbeg's brother Reposh died as a monk in Serbian Orthodox monastery Hilandar in Mount Athos where he was buried. 1432—1436 * Although Skanderbeg was summoned home by his relatives when George Arianiti and Andrew Thopia with other chiefs from region between Vlorë and Shkodër organized rebellion against Ottoman Empire in period 1432—1436, he did nothing, remaining loyal to the sultan. * Skanderbeg commanded Ottoman cavalry in many different battles in Europe and Asia bringing slaves and loot to Ottoman capitol Adrianople. According to Fan Noli, during one battle in Anatolia he first climbed to the wall, raised Ottoman flag and was first among the Ottoman forces to enter the besieged fortress. 1437 * 4 MayJohn Castriot died and was buried in Serbian Orthodox monastery of Hilandar in Mount Athos. * Skanderbeg expected that he would succeed his father and became the lord of the Kastiotis's domain. * Skanderbeg's expectations were not met. Ottomans annexed John's former domain and appointed Skanderbeg as timariot of a timar composed of nine villages in high mountains which until John's death belonged to his domain. * Skanderbeg became subaşi of the Krujë Subaşilik of the Sanjak of Albania in period 1437–1438. * NovemberHizir bey was appointed as subaşi of the Krujë Subaşilik instead of Skanderbeg. 1438 * Skanderbeg continued fighting within Ottoman forces. * MaySkanderbeg's timar (of the vilayet of Dhimitër Jonima) composed of nine villages in high mountains that once belonged to his father John (this timar was listed in Ottoman registers as John's land, Turkish: Yuvan-ili) was awarded to Andre Karlo. * The granting of these villages to André Karlo must have upset Skanderbeg who requested to be granted with control over the zeamet in Misia consisting of his father's former domain. Sanjakbey (probably of the Sanjak of Ohrid) objected Skanderbeg's request. 1439 * 7 JulyA letter from Skanderbeg and widow of John Castriot was presented by their procurator priest Petar to the Dubrovnik's city council. The letter was written in Slavic language and contained their request to inherit 123 ducats two merchants from Dubrovnik owed to John Castriot for customs they did not pay on time. Their request was accepted. 1440 * Skanderbeg was appointed as sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Dibra. 1443 * August 1443George Arianiti again rebelled against Ottomans, probably urged by pope Eugene IV or instigated by the news of defeat of Hadım Şehabeddin. * Early November 1443Skanderbeg participated in the Battle of Niš fighting for Ottoman Empire under Kasim Pasha against allied forces of John Hunyadi, Władysław III of Poland and Đurađ Branković. * Early November 1443After the Ottoman forces were defeated in the Battle of Niš, Skanderbeg forced an Ottoman scribe to forge a letter in which sultan Murad II appoints Skanderbeg as the Governor of Krujë. According to some earlier sources, Skanderbeg deserted the Ottoman army during the Battle of Kunovica on 2 January 1444. * November 28 Together with his nephew Hamza Kastrioti and 300 Ottoman soldiers from Albania Skanderbeg arrived to Krujë and used the forged letter to gain the control of Krujë from Zabel Pasha. * Soon after Skanderbeg captured Krujë his rebels managed to capture many Ottoman fortresses including strategically very important Svetigrad (Kodžadžik) taken with support of Moisi Arianit Golemi and 3,000 rebels from Debar. * According to some sources Skanderbeg impaled captured Ottoman soldiers who refused to be baptized into Christianity. 1444 * March 2A meeting of local regional noblemen from Albania was organized in the Venetian town Lezhë, Albania Veneta. They agreed to establish an alliance (League of Lezhë) to fight under Skanderbeg's command against the Ottoman Empire. * June 29Skanderbeg was victorious against the Ottoman forces in the Battle of Torvioll. * Skanderbeg's forces stole cattle of the citizens of Lezhë and captured their women and children. * November 10After winning the Battle of Varna against crusaders of John Hunyadi, sultan Murad II attempted to convince Skanderbeg to return under Ottoman suzerainty. Skanderbeg refused. * Nicholas Dukagjini, ambushed and killed another League member, Lekë Zaharia Altisferi. * Dukagjini's attempt to capture Zaharia's fortress Dagnum failed. * Zaharia's mother ceded to Venice fortress of Dagnum and all other possessions which belonged to her murdered son Zaharia (Drivast, Sati, Gladri and Dushmani). 1445 * February 12Venetian Republic senate confirmed to Skanderbeg and to his brother Staniša that Venice will have the same obligations toward two of them as they had toward their father, promising them Venetian citizenship and safe conduct in case their enemies drive them away.: \\"Млеци, 12 фебруар 1445, — Млетачки Сенат, на молбу Ђурђa и Станише, синова Ивана Кастриотића, потврђујe концесије дане 1438 год.\\" * October 10Skanderbeg and his forces were victorious in the Battle of Mokra, fought on the mountain of Mokra in Macedonia. 1446 * Spring Through Ragusan diplomats Skanderbeg requested help from the Pope and Kingdom of Hungary to struggle against the Ottomans. * September 27Skanderbeg was victorious in the Battle of Otonetë (north of Debar, Macedonia). * Gjergj Arianiti allied with the Kingdom of Naples. 1447 * Skanderbeg was seduced by Alfonso V into making a war against Venice. * Skanderbeg's envoys visited Serbian Despot Đurađ Branković. Branković gave them cordial reception and informed them that he wish to see people from Albania to capture Dagnum from Venetians. Branković, an Ottoman vassal and lord of Serbian Despotate, promised to help Skanderbeg to fight against the Venetian Republic. * Skanderbeg proclaimed himself the heir of the Balšići and emphasized his intention of gaining control of their former domains. * Skanderbeg claimed to Venice all their towns which were pronoia of murdered Lekë Zaharia Altisferi (Dagnum, Drivast, Sati, Gladri and Dushmani) and also Drivast because it belonged to Serbian Despotate before Venice captured it. * Venice refused Skanderbeg's claim and offered him 1,000 ducats to lay aside all claims. * Skanderbeg refused Venetian offer. * Skanderbeg attacked Durrës. * Skanderbeg failed to capture Venetian towns Bar and Ulcinj after unsuccessful attacks he conducted on behalf of the Kingdom of Naples together with forces of Serbian Despotate led by Đurađ Branković and forces of Principality of Zeta led by Stefan Crnojević. * DecemberSkanderbeg besieged Dagnum, but failed to capture it. * DecemberSkanderbeg's forces reconstructed Baleč fortress and established a garrison of 2,000 men in it with Marin Span as its commander * DecemberVenetian forces (led also by Andrija and Kojčin Humoj, together with Simeon Vulkata) drove away Skanderbeg's forces from Baleč garrison. * DecemberSkanderbeg plundered area around Durrës. 1448 * March 4The Venetian Empire offered a life pension of 100 golden ducats annually for the person who would kill Skanderbeg. * Skanderbeg sent a detachment of his troops to the rural areas of the Kingdom of Naples to suppress a rebellion against Alfonso V. Many of them settled there. * AprilSkanderbeg's forces besieged Durrës and he requested from its citizens annual provision of 400 ducats and two clothing. Citizens of Durrës were willing to accept his request but Senate later rejected such idea because they believed separate peaces would divide weak Venetian forces in area between Durrës and Kotor. * MayThe Venetian Senate accepted offers of some people who promised to kill Skanderbeg for a life pension of 100 ducats annually. * Venetian Senate sent a messenger to the Ottoman sultan and requested that Skanderbeg should be punished \\"because Skanderbeg is Ottoman citizen and we have solid peace with Ottoman Empire\\". * Ottoman forces under command of Sultan Murad II struggled against Skanderbeg with limited results recapturing only a part of the Skanderbeg's territory. * Murad mobilized two armies to attack Skanderbeg. One army of 10,000 cavalry led by Ali Feriz Pasha who was supreme commander of the European Ottoman forces and another of 15,000 cavalry and infantry under command of Mustapha Pasha. * JuneIn action coordinated with Skanderbeg, the lord of Serbian Despotate attacked Venetian towns in the region of Kotor, Budva and Bar. * Because Ottoman forces attacked Skanderbeg Venetians were not concerned about him anymore. They decided not to make peace with him but to destroy him and noblemen allied with him. Therefore, Venetians decided not to allow them to find refugee in their towns. In the same time Venetians opened gates of their cities for peasants to flee from Ottomans leaving Skanderbeg and noblemen allied with him without supplies provided by those peasants. * July 23Skanderbeg was victorious near Shkodër, against Venetian force of 15,000 men under the command of Daniele Iurichi, governor of Scutari. * July 31Skanderbeg lost Svetigrad to Ottoman Empire after the siege (May 14 – July 31). * Skanderbeg's forces under command of Hamza Kastrioti were defeated after they attacked the Venetian fortress near Dagnum. * Murad II abandoned his campaign after receiving the news about preparation for the new Crusade. * August 14Skanderbeg was victorious in the Battle of Oranik (near modern-day Debar, North Macedonia). * September 19 The fire devastated Scutari, damaged city walls and killed around 500 people. This reduced defense potential of the city and increased danger of Skanderbeg's attacks. * When Venetian Senate received news that Serbian Despot prepares another attack on their positions in Zeta. On October 19 Senate issued instructions to Scutari governor to sign a peace treaty with Skanderbeg or to destroy his forces if he refuses the peace. This instructions were late because the governor of Scutari already signed a treaty with Skanderbeg 15 days earlier. * October 4Skanderbeg signed the capitulation to the Venice in Shkodër (disguised as peace treaty). Venice was obliged to pay 1,400 dukats annually to Skanderbeg, but never paid it. Skanderbeg was also obliged to join an anti-Ottoman coalition led by John Hunyadi. * Skanderbeg asked Republic of Ragusa for a loan to be able to fight against Ottomans. He gave hawks to the Ragusan senate as his gift. * Ragusan Senate rejected Skanderbeg's request and granted him 200 ducats. * Hunyadi was defeated in the battle on Kosovo on 17–20 October while Skanderbeg failed to collect enough supplies to finance his forces to join Hunyadi's campaign. It was believed that he was delayed by Đurađ Branković, then allied with Sultan Murad II, whose land Skanderbeg and his forces ravaged as punishment for desertion of Christian cause. Later research has shown this belief to be untrue. * On a session held on November 14 Senate decided what to do with hawks presented by Skanderbeg. 1449 * By 1449 Gjergj Arianiti left his alliance with Skanderbeg. * Skanderbeg tried to regain Svetigrad but failed. * Skanderbeg and Arianiti approached to Venetians requesting their protection. Venetians opted for neutral approach, not to jeopardize peace with Ottomans, and refused their request. * AprilSkanderbeg offered 6,000 ducats to gain the status of protectorate of the Republic of Venice. The same amount he was obliged to pay to the Ottoman Empire as its vassal after he was forced to submit to Ottoman suzerainty. Venetians refused Skanderbeg's offers and informed him that they \\"don't want property that belongs to somebody else\\" while emphasizing their willingness to help Skanderbeg to negotiate peace with Ottomans.* Skanderbeg supported Venetian appointment of Ivan Crnojević as Duke. * Skanderbeg asked Venice to allow him to graze his cattle on Venetian territory (villages Medoa and Vilipoje). Venice allowed him to do so. * Skanderbeg sent another detachment of troops to Italy, to garrison Sicily against a rebellion and invasion. This time the troops were led by brothers Giorgio and Basilio Reres, sons of Demetrios. 1450 * Skanderbeg sends a letter written on Serbian language to Ragusa to inform its nobility that Ottoman sultan was going to attack him. * Skanderbeg organized a beginning of the construction of Rodoni Castle. * League of Lezhë collapsed when Ottoman forces approached. * Skanderbeg left Krujë before it was besieged. * May 14The Ottoman siege of Krujë began. * Arianiti begged Venetians to work on peace between Sultan and Skanderbeg if Ottomans would not capture Krujë. * October 14Skanderbeg offered Krujë to the Venetians, threatening to capitulate the fortress to the Ottomans if they did not accept it. * October 26Murad lifted the siege of Krujë. * The Venetians replied to Skanderbeg's offer rejecting it and offered to help Skanderbeg to harmonize his relationship with OttomansSetton, Kenneth Meyer. The Papacy and the Levant (1204-1571). Vol. II.p.101, Darby, PA: DIANE Publishing, 1978. . * The peace was agreed between Ottomans and Skanderbeg who again obliged himself to pay tribute to the sultan. * Skanderbeg was at the end of his resources. He lost all of his possessions except Krujë. Other Albanian nobles allied with Murad like he saved them from the oppression. After the Ottoman withdrawal they continued to struggle against Skanderbeg's efforts to enforce his authority.Setton, Kenneth Meyer. The Papacy and the Levant (1204-1571). Vol. II.p.102, Darby, PA: DIANE Publishing, 1978. . * Skanderbeg travelled to Ragusa to urge for and to collect Ragusans' and pope's financial support. 1451 * JanuarySkanderbeg was appointed as \\"captain general of the king of Aragon\\" * 3 FebruarySultan Murad II dies and Mehmed the Conqueror began his reign. He had in mind much bigger plans than capture of Kruje. He planned to capture Byzantine held Constantinople. After the dissolution of the League of Lezhe, not being aware of new Ottoman plans, Skanderbeg believed he was forced to seeks external assistance. * 26 March Skanderbeg got external assistance by signing the Treaty of Gaeta and recognizing suzerainty of the Kingdom of Naples. * End of MayNeapolitan military officer Bernat Vaquer, sent by Alphonso v with one hundred infantry soldiers, took over Kruje on behalf of the Kingdom of Naples and put its garrison under his command. * Pal Dukagjini and Peter Spani remained aligned with Venice and established friendly relations with the Sultan. * April 21Skanderbeg married Donika Kastrioti, daughter of Gjergj Arianiti in an Eastern Orthodox Ardenica Monastery. * Venice continued its efforts to turn Skanderbeg's allies against Kingdom of Naples and Skanderbeg. George Arianiti cut himself off from Albanian politics while Paul Dukagjini, member of Dukagjini Family and father of Lekë Dukagjini, however, prepared for war against Skanderbeg. 1452 * 23 — 25 AprilAlphonso V appointed Ramon d'Ortafa as governor of Kruje and Albania. He also informed Johan de Castro, a castellan of Kruje at that time, about this appointment and ordered him to hand over Kruje to d'Ortafa. Alphonso V sent letters to Skanderbeg, George Arianiti and other tribal leaders in Albania to inform them about appointment of d'Ortafa and to instruct them to accept his governance. * Rodoni Castle has been constructed. * SpringGiammaria Biemmi claims that Dukagjini attempted to kill Skanderbeg in the spring of 1452. It is not possible to confirm this claim which is supported by some scholars as well as information that Skanderbeg and Dukagjini made peace on 25 September 1452. * July 21Skanderbeg was victorious in Battle of Modrica and Battle of Meçad where his forces killed Tahip Pasha and captured Hamza Pasha who was ransomed for 13,000 dukats. * JulyDukagjini opted for a reconciliation with Skanderbeg. * AutumnSkanderbeg sent his troops to aid the Venetians thwart the attack of Serbian Despotate on the Venetian city of Cattaro. 1453 * March 5Alfonso sent a letter censuring Venice for not paying its dues to Skanderbeg and also for supporting Skanderbeg's enemies. He thus urged for a peremptory measure to all AlbanianVenetian conflicts. * April 22Skanderbeg was victorious in the Battle of Pollog fought near modern-day Tetovo in North Macedonia. * Alfonso promised to send men and an annual pension of 1,500 ducats to Skanderbeg, whereas Pope Nicholas V sent 5,000 florins. * September 18Venetians sent a letter to Skanderbeg expressing their gratitude for his willingness to help them to negotiate peace with Serbian despot. * September 25Ragusa has decided to give deposits of Stefan Branković to Skanderbeg's envoys. * 9 OctoberVenetian Senate informs Skanderbeg that his request to be accompanied by the Venetian governor of Alessio during his trip to Rome and Naples has been accepted. * 6 December Alphonso V assured Pedro Skuder, castellan of Kruje, that Kruje will be delivered necessary supplies. 1454 * Ramon d’Ortafà minted coins in Kruje. * Skanderbeg signed peace treaty with Dukagjini Family after many years of skirmishes between them. * October 9Venetian Senate allowed governor of Alessio Petro Marcello to accompany Skanderbeg during his travel to Italy. * October 21Alphonso V from his Castel Nuovo writes to Skanderbeg that Paul Dukagjini sent his envoys and declared his loyalty and vassalage to the Kingdom of Naples. Based on that Alphonso V awarded Paul Dukagjini with 300 ducats of annual provisions. * In a letter brought to Alphonso V by Paolo Cuccia, Skanderbeg requested support for attack on Ottoman held Berat. 1455 * JulySkanderbeg's forces (supported with strong contingent of Neapolitans from Alphonso V) were badly defeated when they failed to capture Berat during the Siege of Berat. Muzaka Thopia was killed in the battle while Golemi deserted to the Ottomans 1456 * end of MarchSkanderbeg was victorious in the Battle of Oranik where he defeated his former companion, Golemi; the latter allied himself with the Ottomans. * AprilGolemi returned to Skanderbeg and joined his forces * By MayGjergj Arianiti allied with Venice. * Venice appointed Gjergj Arianiti on the position of captain of the Venetian Albania, which additionally weakened Skanderbeg's cause. * According to Fan Noli, Gjergj Stress Balsha, sold the fortress of Modrič to the Ottomans for 30,000 silver ducats. He tried to cover up the act; however, his treason was discovered and he was sent to prison in Naples. * November 4According to the reports sent to Duchy of Milan, Skanderbeg helped Leke Dukagjini to capture Venetian held Dagnum. * November 9According to one report Venetians had intention to attack Skanderbeg because he was a supporter of Alfonso V of Aragon to whom he granted Kruje, so Skanderbeg's men have to go all the way to Venetian held Durazo or Scutari if they want to fight against Ottomans. * Skanderbeg's son Gjon was born. * Hamza Kastrioti, Skanderbeg's own nephew and his close collaborator, defected to the Ottomans. 1457 * JunePelinović brought to Venice Skanderbeg's letter in which he complained because Venetians were not regularly paying him the agreed provisions. * In the name of Skanderbeg, Pelinović went in a diplomatic mission to Pope Callixtus III and convinced him to continue with the payments of his allowances to Skanderbeg. * JulySkanderbeg requested from Venetians to allow his forces to cross Venetian territory because they wanted to attack Ottoman positions in Upper Zeta. Senate refused his request. * AugustVenetians recaptured Dagnum from Leke Dukagjini after fierce battle and significant casualties.

Before Venetians took over the control over Sati, Skanderbeg captured it and surrounding area driving Lekë Dukagjini and his forces away, because he opposed to Skanderbeg and destroyed Sati before Venetian takeover. * Although Skanderbeg had intention to accept the Ottoman proposal for the three year armistice, the pope did not allow him and he had to refuse it. To show his discontent Skanderbeg refused to participate in the Council of Mantua held to plan the future crusade. 1460 * Skanderbeg sent his nephew, Constantine Kastrioti, with 500 cavalry to Barletta, to struggle for Ferrante I of Naples. * Skanderbeg appointed Đorđe Pelinović, abbot of Ratac Abbey, as his procurator. * In mid-1460 dethroned Serbian Despot Stefan Branković came to Albania to visit his relatives.Srejović/Gavrilović 1982. p. 375.

Stefan married Angelina, the sister of Donika, who married Skanderbeg. 1461 * At the beginning of 1461 Stefan Branković went to Italy with Skanderbeg's written recommendation. According to some sources Stefan stayed in Albania until 1466. Stefan stayed with Skanderbeg and supported his anti-Ottoman struggle forging plans to recapture Serbia and Smederevo from Ottomans.Спремић, Момчило, Борбе за ослобођење Смедерева (1459–1485), Смедеревски Зборник 3 (2011), 13–29. * April - Ragusan Senate promised Skanderbeg safe haven from Ottomans in case he would need one. * Mid JuneSkanderbeg agreed to a ceasefire with Mehmed which was agreed to last for three years.
