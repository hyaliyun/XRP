Starring an ensemble cast led by Ellen Burstyn, Kieran Culkin, Julie Delpy, Danny DeVito, Greta Gerwig, Tracy Letts, and Zosia Mamet, the film serves as a spin-off from Solondz's 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse, which also features the character of Dawn Wiener. The film is also inspired by the 1966 drama Au Hasard Balthazar, directed by Robert Bresson. The film had its world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2016. before receiving a limited release on June 24, 2016, by Amazon Studios and IFC Films.

His wife Dina does not want to deal with caring for the dog, but Danny informs her Remi is mature and old enough to help the two with the responsibilities. Dina brings Wiener-Dog to the vet to get spayed, and on their way, Remi becomes upset. Dina comforts Remi by telling him an embellished story about her childhood dog, which she claims died after giving birth to a litter of stillborn puppies. During Dina and Danny's yoga class, Remi and Wiener-Dog tear up the couch cushions and cover the living room in feathers. Wiener Dog wanders off into the kitchen, and Remi feeds her a chocolate chip granola bar. Wiener-Dog becomes very ill, and the next day Danny brings Wiener-Dog to the vet to be euthanized. At the vet, veterinary nurse Dawn takes Wiener-Dog from the consultation room before the vet can euthanise her. She brings Wiener-Dog home with her, where she nurses the dog back to life. One day while shopping for pet food, she runs into her old school acquaintance Brandon, who invites her to visit his brother Tommy and his wife April, both with Down syndrome, in Ohio. Dawn agrees, and the two head off to Ohio, where they come across homesick Mexican hitchhikers. Once they arrive in Ohio, Brandon informs his brother that their father had died due to alcoholism. Tommy asks Brandon to stop doing drugs, and Brandon promises he has stopped, even though he was shown injecting drugs earlier in the trip. Dawn offers to leave Wiener-Dog with Tommy and April, who happily accept Dawn's offer. On their way home, Dawn and Brandon talk about their future together and happily hold hands. Wiener- Dog then arrives with Dave Schmerz, a screenwriting professor who is attempting to get his second screenplay off the ground. One day at work, Schmerz is informed that various students and administration members are complaining about his constant negativity. Schmerz is asked to attend a discussion with a previous student who became a famous film director, who mocks Schmerz's teaching and encourages the students to drop out. Schmerz creates a bomb and attaches it to Wiener-Dog. Students notice and contact authorities. Dave gets stopped by authorities investigating the incident on the way home and willingly identifies himself. Elderly Nana, who lives with her caregiver Yvette, is Wiener-Dog's final owner. She names her \\"Cancer.\\" Nana receives a call from her granddaughter Zoe, who is on her way to visit for the first time in several years, along with her boyfriend Fantasy, a conceptual artist. Once Zoe arrives, she asks for money in order to pay for Fantasy's new art project. Nana agrees to give her the money. While filling out the check, Zoe confides in her Nana, wondering if Fantasy is cheating on her. Once Zoe leaves, Nana goes outside and sits with Wiener-Dog, where she dreams about a younger version of herself coming back to show her what her life could have been if she had been more positive. She wakes up to discover Wiener-Dog has run away. She then spots Wiener-Dog being run over and killed by a truck. Six months later, a stuffed animatronic Wiener-Dog is displayed in Fantasy's art exhibit.

It holds a 74% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 108 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"For filmgoers predisposed to enjoy Todd Solondz' brand of black comedy, Wiener-Dog won't disappoint ‚Äî but those put off by previous works need not apply.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 66 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\". Guy Lodge of Variety gave the film a positive review, writing: \\"Each of their mini-narratives plays out in the pause-heavy mode of highly mannered mundanity that will feel entirely natural to Solondz acolytes ‚Äî and, it seems, to the actors, most of whom tackle the director‚Äôs customarily arch dialogue with brusque aplomb. Delpy, in particular, was born to deliver his harshest words, though it‚Äôs Burstyn ‚Äî using very few at all, her set face shifting and falling as the script lends reasoning to her froideur ‚Äî whom viewers might find themselves unable to shake.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review writing: \\"These last minutes are the best in the film and by far the most visually dazzling, even though Ed Lachman‚Äôs cinematography throughout stands as a model of subtle and elegant compositional skill tested by what are, for the most part, deliberately banal settings.\\" World Socialist Web Site reviewer David Walsh gave the film a positive review, commenting that \\"the hostility directed toward the contemporary art and film scene is perhaps the strongest feature of Wiener-Dog.\\" References External links  2016 films 2016 comedy films American films American anthology films American comedy films American independent films English-language films Films about dogs Films about suburbia Films set in New York City Films set in Ohio Films shot in New York City Films produced by Christine Vachon Films produced by Megan Ellison Films directed by Todd Solondz Annapurna Pictures films Killer Films films IFC Films films Amazon Studios films Down syndrome in film ","title":"Wiener-Dog (film)"},{"id":"47100878","text":"Walther Gottlieb Louis Leisler Kiep (5 January 1926 ‚Äì 9 May 2016) was a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He was a member of the Bundestag between 1965 and 1976 and again from 1980 to 1982. After switching to state-level politics, he served as minister of economy (1976‚Äì77) and minister of finance (1976‚Äì80) in Lower Saxony under Ernst Albrecht. In 1982, Kiep was the leading candidate for the CDU in two successive state elections in Hamburg, losing both to incumbent Klaus von Dohn√°nyi. From 1971 until 1992, he was treasurer of his party at the federal level. In this position, Kiep installed a system of unreported income accounts, leading to the CDU donations scandal in 1999. Life and family Coming from a liberal family, Kiep was born on 5 January 1926 in Hamburg to Louis Leisler Kiep, a navy captain and business man, and Eugenie Maria Anna vom Rath. Kiep's maternal grandfather, Walther vom Rath, had been a member of the Prussian House of Representatives from 1894 to 1898 and later a member of the House of Lords until 1918. His middle name \\"Leisler\\" came from Jacob Leisler, a German-born colonist and ancestor of Kiep, who participated in early independence movements in New York and was hanged by the English in 1691. Kiep went to school in Hamburg and Istanbul, achieving his Abitur in 1943 before joining the Wehrmacht. On 20 April 1944, Adolf Hitler's birthday, he joined the Nazi Party. In the same year his uncle, Otto Carl Kiep, was executed by the Nazis for his membership in the Kreisau Circle. After the war, he started to study history and economics, but did not graduate. Before moving into politics, he worked for the Insurance Company of North America from 1948 to 1955. Starting in 1955, he worked for a company called Gradmann und Holler, an insurance broker company for large businesses. Kiep owned 15 percent of the company in 1982. His involvement with Gradmann und Holler sparked controversy. When Kiep became minister in Lower Saxony in 1976, Volkswagen and other local companies went into business with Gradmann und Holler, creating a possible conflict of interest for the minister. Kiep also served on Volkswagen's board of directors. Kiep denied abusing his power as minister, saying that the deal with Volkswagen had been financially damaging rather than profitable for his company. Due to his successful business ventures, Kiep was considered to be one of the richest politicians in Germany. In an interview, Kiep told Playboy that he could live well just from the interest from his savings. From 1950, Kiep was married to Charlotte Kiep, born 1920, daughter of IG Farben board member and convicted war criminal Fritz ter Meer. They met when Kiep was only thirteen years old. He needed to visit Fritz ter Meer in Landsberg Prison to ask for his daughter's hand in marriage. They had four children together, sons Walther, Michael and daughters Charlotte and Christiane. Their second son, Michael J√ºrgen, died in 1975, aged 24. The parents started a foundation for young journalists in his name. From a previous marriage of his wife's, Kiep was stepfather to another son, Edmund. On 30 November 1974, an assassination attempt was made on Kiep, during which a man fired three shots at the door of his sauna, though he remained uninjured. The assassin was never found and leads hinting towards involvement of the Red Army Faction proved inconclusive. As the German magazine Der Spiegel wrote a year later, some party colleagues allegedly considered it possible that Kiep had staged the attack himself. Political career Kiep at a CDU party convention in Cologne, 1983 Member of parliament Kiep became a member of the CDU in the fall of 1961, gaining a seat in the county council of Obertaunus in 1963. Following the 1965 federal election, he became a member of the Bundestag, winning a mandate in the Obertaunus constituency. He retained his seat in 1969 and 1972, this time as part of his party's electoral list in Hessen. In 1972, Kiep was one of only a few CDU parliamentarians who voted yes to the Basic Treaty (Grundlagenvertrag) between West and East Germany. Other supporters of Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik were Richard von Weizs√§cker, Karl Carstens and Olaf von Wrangel. During the 1972 federal elections, Kiep was named as prospective Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development in the shadow cabinet of Rainer Barzel. He left parliament on 24 February 1976 to join the state government in Lower Saxony. During his tenure as minister, he also held a seat in the Landtag of Lower Saxony from 1978 to 1980. He regained a seat in the Bundestag following the 1980 election, entering through a place on the electoral list for Lower Saxony. In order to concentrate on his role as leading candidate in his home state of Hamburg, he once again left parliament on 26 April 1982. Minister in Lower Saxony 1976 saw the state government change in the German Bundesland of Lower Saxony, when the coalition government of the SPD and FDP was unable to agree on a successor to minister-president Alfred Kubel. As a consequence, the CDU used renegade votes from the government camp to elect Ernst Albrecht into office. Albrecht called Kiep into his government, as minister of economy and finance. After the CDU minority government was replaced by a coalition with the FDP in January 1977, Kiep left his position in the ministry for economy, but continued to lead the ministry of finance until 1980. A controversial topic during his tenure as minister was the search for a radioactive waste site in Lower Saxony. In 1975, three locations had been deemed suitable for further investigation: the salt domes Lutterloh, Lichtenhorst and Wahn. Two years later, however, the state government designated the Gorleben salt dome as a single location for the repository and waste disposal center. In 2011, a commission of enquiry of the Bundestag investigated the award procedure. Journal entries of Kiep's had implied that he was the driving force behind the decision to promote Gorleben, putting the idea forward at a meeting with Albrecht and three federal ministers in Hanover on 11 November 1976. Since he had attended a meeting with delegates from the nuclear power industry on the same day, it was speculated that the lobby had exercised influence on Kiep. Appearing before the committee as a witness, Kiep claimed not to remember the events exactly but said that he considered it \\"unlikely\\" that he was the one who proposed Gorleben, because he did not have enough expertise in the matter. Minister-president Albrecht and Kiep were prominent representatives of the liberal wing of the CDU, who aimed to move their party towards support for the Ostpolitik of the SPD/FDP federal government. In 1976, they lobbied for their party's approval of new treaties with Poland, against conservative figures such as Alfred Dregger, Franz Josef Strau√ü and Hans Filbinger. This was also considered to be part of a plan of CDU chairman Helmut Kohl to bring the liberal FDP back into a coalition with the Christian Democrats (which was ultimately successful in 1982). That Kiep's work was popular with the FDP was proven in early 1976: the party's Theodor Heuss foundation (de) awarded him with their highest award, which Keip refused in deference to his party affiliation. In 1978, Kiep served as a special representative for chancellor Helmut Schmidt during a debt crisis in Turkey, mediating between the government of B√ºlent Ecevit, with whom he developed a friendship, and the International Monetary Fund. Kiep eventually collected 910 million US$ for Turkey from various states. In the 1980 federal election, Kiep was named as foreign minister in the shadow cabinet of Franz Josef Strau√ü. Candidate in Hamburg In 1982, Kiep served as the leading candidate for the CDU in two separate state elections in his hometown of Hamburg. The first, regular election in June brought a majority of votes for Kiep and heavy losses for the SPD and incumbent First Mayor Klaus von Dohn√°nyi. Since the Green Party gained enough votes to be represented in the B√ºrgerschaft, the political situation was at a deadlock. After von Dohn√°nyi proved unsuccessful in forming a minority government tolerated by the Greens, new elections were called for December. Kiep was once again the CDU candidate, but in \\"an election upset\\", the SPD was able to get enough votes to form a government on their own. This was seen as a sign of support of Hamburg's population for former chancellor Helmut Schmidt (born in Hamburg), who had been replaced in a constructive vote of no confidence by the CDU in October. Treasurer of the CDU and scandals Helmut Kohl (left) and Kiep (right), two prominent figures in the CDU donations scandal, pictured in 1975 Kiep served as federal treasurer of the CDU from 1971 to 1992. During his tenure, the party was involved in several financial scandals. Shortly after taking over, Kiep brought in economist Uwe L√ºthje as general agent and public accountant Horst Weyrauch as a financial consultant. Together, the three started an elaborate system aimed at accumulating funding for the party. The Staatsb√ºrgerliche Vereinigung 1954 e.V. (de) was used by major companies to donate money to the CDU anonymously, while the donations were fully tax deductible due to the Vereinigung being considered non-profit. Just in the election year 1972, 30 million Deutsche Mark are said to have been accumulated in this fashion. Over the course of its existence, the Vereinigung gave 214 million Deutsche Marks to political parties between 1969 and 1980. The procedure was made public during the uncovering of the Flick affair in the early 1980s. Kiep was ultimately accused of having amassed 18.5 million Deutsche Marks in illegal donations for the CDU, evading nine million Deutsche Marks in taxes. For his role, he was sentenced to a payment of 675,000 Deutsche Marks in 1991, but the verdict was revoked a year later by the Federal Court of Justice. In 1995, the public prosecution department of the city of Augsburg obtained the calendars of Karlheinz Schreiber, a German arms dealer. With the help of the documents, the persecutors were able to decipher a code of aliases and money movements, leading to Kiep. On 4 November 1999, the prosecution office issued an arrest warrant against Kiep, charging him with having accepted a payment of one million Deutsche Marks from Schreiber in 1991 without subjecting the money to taxes. After turning himself in a day later, Kiep declared during his interrogation that he had accepted the money, with Horst Weyrauch present, as a donation for the CDU. This started the CDU donations scandal, in which a system of illegal accounts was uncovered. On 30 November, former chancellor Helmut Kohl took full responsibility for the accounts and later admitted to having personally accepted a total sum of up to two million Deutsche Marks from anonymous sponsors, which were not declared. As a consequence of the illegal proceedings, the CDU was sentenced to a payment of 41 million Deutsche Marks by President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse on 15 February 2000. Kiep was ultimately involved in several lawsuits concerning tax evasion. One was closed in January 2004, after Kiep paid a monetary condition of 75,000 Euro. In another trial in 2001, he was sentenced to pay 45,000 Deutsche Marks. In early 2004, Kiep accepted a sentence of 40,500 Euro for a false statement given at the enquiry commission on the donations scandal. Death Kiep died on 9 May 2016, surrounded by his family in his home in Kronberg im Taunus in Hesse, at the age of 90.

Ellwood (born 1933) is an American academic, author and expert on world religions. He was educated at the University of Colorado, Berkeley Divinity School and was awarded a PhD in History of Religions from the University of Chicago in 1967. He was Professor of World Religions at the University of Southern California from 1967 until 1997 and is now professor emeritus. Life Robert Scott Ellwood, Jr., was born July 17, 1933, in Normal, Illinois, the son of Robert Sr. and Knola Ellwood. Robert Sr. was a teacher in the high school affiliated with Illinois State Normal University, and a pioneer in the development of sociology as a high school subject. In 1945 the family moved to Chadron, Nebraska, where Robert Sr. became chair of the Education Department at the Nebraska State Teachers College located there. Robert Jr. graduated from Chadron Preparatory School in 1951, and from the University of Colorado in 1954. He then attended Berkeley Divinity School in New Haven, CT, an Episcopal seminary now affiliated with Yale Divinity School. He graduated and was ordained a priest in the Episcopal Church in 1957. He pastored Christ Church, Central City, NE 1957-1960. In 1961-62 Ellwood served as a chaplain in the U.S. Navy. While stationed in Okinawa and Japan he became interested in Japanese religion, and world religions generally. Reading the works of Mircea Eliade led to an interest in Eliade's structuralist and phenomenological approach to religion as a way of understanding similarities and differences in religions. As a consequence, in 1963 he entered the University of Chicago Divinity School's history of religion program led by Eliade, receiving the Ph.D. in 1967 after a final year of study in Japan. In 1967 Ellwood became a professor of religion at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, serving there until retirement in 1997. In 1988 he received a Fulbright Research Grant to study new religious movements in New Zealand, and spent six months there working in the national library in Wellington. He also taught briefly in the Universities of Cape Town and Natal in South Africa, and after retirement at Auburn University in Alabama. He was named Distinguished Emeritus Professor by U.S.C. in 2002, and Alumnus of the Year by the University of Chicago Divinity School in 2009. Work As professor of religion at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, Ellwood mainly taught courses on Eastern religions and the history of religion. His first book, The Feast of Kingship, about the Daij≈çsai or Japanese imperial accession ceremony, was based on his Ph.D. dissertation. Subsequently, given the tremendous spiritual ferment in California in the late 1960s, he became interested in new religious and spiritual movements in America, doing an informal survey of them in Los Angeles and publishing Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America. He also wrote on the history of American religion in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as textbooks on world religions, religious studies, and Japanese religion. Cycles of Faith presented a theory of the comparative development of world religions. The Politics of Myth was a discussion of the controversial political histories of C.G. Jung, Mircea Eliade, and Joseph Campbell. A late series of three books offered a comparative view of mythologies. Ellwood's approach to comparative religion has been fundamentally structuralist, phenomenological, and empathetic. He has sought through religion's material expression in art, architecture, rite, and practices to understand empathetically its inner meaning for adherents, always allowing for an immense range of individual responses, but recognizing also that religious forms have as it were a language of their own. In Cycles of Faith he further considers that the history of individual religions may have an internal dynamic of their own, as well as responding to outer history. Personal life In 1965 Ellwood married Gracia Fay Bouwman, also a student in the University of Chicago Divinity School and subsequently an instructor in Evansville College, Indiana. They had two children, Richard Scott Lancelot (b. 1974) and Fay Elanor (b. 1977). In 1976 he joined the Theosophical Society in America, serving as vice president of that organization 2002-05. He has also served as a priest in the Liberal Catholic Church, Province of the United States of America, a small denomination informally affiliated with Theosophy. He offered a few books of popular spirituality through the Theosophical publishing house, Quest Books. After retirement he and Gracia Fay moved to Krotona, a Theosophical community in Ojai, CA.

He was born in Bhagalpur, part of the Bengal Presidency in British India. Bhattacharya gained a bachelor's degree from Patna University and a doctorate from the University of London. He returned to India and joined the diplomatic service. Bhattacharya served in the United States, to which country he returned as a teacher of literary studies once he had left the service. He taught in Hawaii, and later in Seattle. In his mid-thirties Bhattacharya began writing fiction set in historically and socially realistic contexts. He wrote in English, his chosen medium following the advice of two prominent literary figures. Personal life Bhattacharya was born in Bhagalpur, part of the Bengal Presidency of British India. His parents were Bengalis. Bhattacharya studied at Patna University and received a bachelor's degree in English literature. He subsequently completed his graduate studies in the United Kingdom. While his original choice was to do so in literature, a hostile attitude from one of the professors prompted him to switch to history. Bhattacharya received Master's (1931) and Doctoral degrees (1934) from the University of London. As a graduate student, Bhattacharya became involved with Marxist circles, and was also strongly influenced by Harold Laski, one of his teachers. He was also active in literary circles and had work published in various magazines and newspapers. Some of Bhattacharya's articles were published in The Spectator, and he developed a friendship with the editor, Francis Yeats-Brown. During this time, Bhattacharya also interacted with Rabindranath Tagore. He translated Tagore's poem The Golden Boat into English in 1930. Both Yeats- Brown and Tagore advised Bhattacharya to write his fiction in English, rather than Bengali. On completion of his doctoral studies Bhattacharya moved to Calcutta and soon got married. After a few years, he joined the diplomatic service, serving in the Indian Embassy in Washington, D. C. as a Press Attach√©, returning to India after completing that service. Bhattacharya accepted an offer to join the University of Hawaii as a visiting faculty, subsequently moving permanently to Seattle to take up a chair at the University of Washington. Literary review Writing style and reception Bhattacharya is described as belonging to the social realism school of Indo-Anglian literature. His writings exhibit the influence of Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi. Unlike other social realists like Premchand, Bhattacharya adopted a pedagogical approach to making novels out of ideas, utilizing satire and making his ideas more tangible through situational examples. The range of South Indian writers who seems to dominate the scene of 'Gandhian Fiction' Bhabani Bhtatacharya deserves to be mention for his first novel 'So Many Hungers'(1947), published few months after Independence. set in a context of the 1942-43 Bengal famine and Quit India Movement this complicated and didactic novel takes its characters through a rigorously Gandhian education. It is at one level, the story of Kajoli, a village girl who righteously rejects the prostitution forced on her by the destitution of her family, to sell newspapers and so also to assume the persona of the Gandhian 'New Woman.' At another level, it deals with the spiritual and political growing up of Rahoul, a Cambridge educated astrophysicist who simultaneously discovers the limits of intellectualism and Western civilization and renounces both in favour of nationalism and village based economy. Much of his instruction comes by way of his grand father, Devata, a saintly Gandhian figure with a penchant for the hunger strike, who is responsible for bringing satyagraha to the village of Baruni, where he lives like one of the peasant.

Like most hospices in the UK it is largely funded by voluntary donations. About a third of its funding is provided by the NHS, so the organisation has to raise around ¬£20,000 a day to keep the hospice open. Mark Hunter MP took the decision in March 2015 to devolve NHS funding to Greater Manchester as a chance to make end of life care more integrated and hospices to be better supported financially.

During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39) he was briefly in charge of Supplies for the Madrid Defense Council, before being shot and badly wounded at an Anarchist roadblock. After the war he lived in hiding in Spain for some time, then was arrested, tried and executed. Early years Pablo Yag√ºe Estebaranz was born in Condado de Castilnovo in 1909 or 1910. He moved to Madrid in search of work and found employment delivering bread. In 1925 he joined the Bakery union affiliated with the Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores (UGT, General Union of Workers), in which he reached managerial positions between 1933 and 1935. In 1930 he joined the Communist Party of Spain (Partido Comunista de Espa√±a, PCE) along with other union leaders such as Isidoro Di√©guez and Luis Cabo Giorla. He was arrested several times: in 1931 (accused of trying to poison the water supply of Madrid) and in 1933 and 1935 (for belonging to the Madrid Provincial Committee of the PCE). In early 1936 he was the secretary of this committee. Civil war In November 1936, the government evacuated to Valencia. The Political Bureau of the PCE remained in Madrid, unlike the leaders of the other parties. Pedro Checa and Antonio Mije negotiated with General Jos√© Miaja for participation of the Communists in Madrid Defense Council (Junta de Defensa de Madrid). The communists were given three ministries, War, Supplies and Public Order, which were to be led by Antonio Mije, Pablo Yag√ºe and Santiago Carrillo, respectively. Yag√ºe represented the UGT and Carrillo the Unified Socialist Youth. His first action was to impose controls that limited shoppers to buying food at one store. If supplies there were exhausted they could try other stores in the same district. As the siege took effect, he had to deal with upward pressure on prices. The Defense Council was restructured and renamed the Junta Delegada de Defensa de Madrid, or the Delegate Defense Council of Madrid, to comply with an order of 25 November 1936 by President Francisco Largo Caballero. This was to affirm that the council was subordinate to the government. On 2 December 1936 the Defense Council reconvened with Miaja as chairman. Isidoro Di√©guez was now Militias delegate, Yag√ºe retained Supplies and Carrillo retained Public Order. On 23 December 1936 Yag√ºe was stopped at three in the afternoon at a roadblock while traveling out of Madrid on official business. The block was run by anarchists guarding the Libertarian Atheneum. They were preventing passage of those who did not carry a pass validated by the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). According to the anarchists, Yag√ºe refused to stay at the roadblock after the guards decided he did not have proper documentation. When the car drove on, the guards fired at it and Yag√ºe was seriously injured by a bullet in the back. The Communists said it was a premeditated attack, caused by the hostility of the anarchists, who had interfered in the distribution of food in collectivized establishments. The incident led to fighting and retaliatory actions in Madrid between communists and anarcho-syndicalists that took the life of several militants on both sides. Those involved, who were arrested after the incident by forces of Santiago Carrillo's Delegation of Public Order, were eventually acquitted by a people's court. Due to the severity of his wounds, Yag√ºe was relieved as a member of the Council and replaced by Luis Nieto de la Fuente, his deputy. The Madrid Defense Council was dissolved on 23 April 1937. In May 1937 Yag√ºe was discharged and went on to serve in the Bakers union. In March 1939 Segismundo Casado launched an anti-communist uprising in Madrid supported by the militant anarchist Cipriano Mera. After Casado succeeded, Yag√ºe was arrested and interned in Porlier prison. Last years Yag√ºe was in Porlier prison when Madrid fell into the hands of General Francisco Franco's troops, resulting in the end of the civil war. However, he was released on 23 September 1941 without being brought to trial. He hid in the house of Alicia Martinez, whom he had known during the civil war and with whom he had a relationship, without getting involved in rebuilding the clandestine structure of the party. However, he was arrested again, along with his girlfriend and her parents. He was admitted again to the Porlier prison. He and fourteen other people were tried in April 1943. They were accused of having tried to reorganize Communist Party groups and cells, of sabotage and attacks, and of various war crimes. Yag√ºe, with eleven of the accused, was sentenced to death and shot by firing squad on 19 May 1943 against the walls of the Cementerio de la Almudena.

The label takes its name from the ancient Greek poet and lyre-player, Arion. In the 1960s and 1970s Arion was seen as one of the most adventurous and innovative independent labels in France with an eclectic catalogue ranging from classical music to ethnic music to jazz. Its strengths were, and remain, rarely performed classical works and ethnic music.Way, Michael (3 July 1971). \\"A Review of French Disk Scene\\", p. 48.

Retrieved 28 June 2015 (subscription required for complete article) . History In 1962 Ariane Segal, who had been working as a producer for the French division of Ricordi, left the firm with her entire team, including her sound engineer Claude Morel. She established a new independent label, Arion, serving as its president and managing director, while Morel served as the label's artistic director. By 1967 when Arion signed a US distribution deal with CBS, its recordings had already received prizes from the Acad√©mie Charles Cros and the Acad√©mie du disque fran√ßais.Adamis, Eddie (10 March 1962). \\"Twist to last out the year\\", p. 22. BillboardBillboard (18 November 1967), \\"CBS and Arion Distrib Pact\\", p. 56 While most single LPs produced in France during the 1960s and 70s were packaged in sleeves, Arion's records were presented in books with copious liner notes, most of which were written by Segal herself. With the arrival of the compact disc, Arion, with its large catalogue of vinyl records, lacked the financial resources to convert to the new medium. Rather than selling the company to one of her rivals, Segal sold it to the Italian firm Ducale, who had distributed the Arion label in Italy and had begun buying stock in Arion in 1984. Ducale's owner, David Matalon, took over as president of Arion in 1985. His daughter Manuela Matalon Ostrolenk became the managing director, while Segal stayed on as head of A&R; for the label's classical division. Shortly after Matalon's takeover, Arion announced plans for its first four releases on compact disc. These included Les flutes de terres Incas performed by the Andean music ensemble and Guillaume Bouzignac's Motets et sc√®nes sacr√©es.Billboard (3 August 1985). \\"Ducale Takes Over Arion\\", p. 71Riesel, Yves (6 April 2011). \\"Ariane Segal est morte\\". Qobuz Magazine. Retrieved 28 June 2015 . In the ensuing years Arion gradually re-released the recordings in its vinyl catalogue on CD as well as continuing to produce new CD recordings and in 1997 acquired the Pierre Verany label. As of 2015 Manuela Ostrolenk serves as both president and CEO of Arion. Ariane Segal, who was described by one of her colleagues at Ricordi as \\"a remarkable woman, way ahead of her time\\", died in 2011 at the age of 93.Biblioth√®que nationale de France.

Repertoire Although from its inception Arion produced recordings in a range of genres, including jazz, dance, and film soundtracks, its core repertoire has been classical and ethnic music from around the world, including the traditional folk music of France. Between 1974 and 1984, Arion produced over 30 LP recordings of ethnic music for the French organization , many of which have subsequently been re-released on CD by the organization's own label.Gr√ºnd, Fran√ßoise and Ch√©rif Khaznadar, Ch√©rif (1996). Atlas de l'Imaginaire , p. 203. Maison des Cultures du Monde/Favre. Retrieved 29 June 2015 . In the classical repertoire, Arion was known for championing composers who had fallen into obscurity such as Hyacinthe Jadin and contemporary composers such as Maurice Ohana as well as the forgotten works of established composers. An example of the latter was their 1993 recording of Daniel Auber's opera Gustave III, ou Le bal masqu√©, composed thirty-five years prior to Verdi's more famous setting, Un ballo in maschera. Under Ariane Segal, Arion also recorded 40 LPs of music by women composers, including that of the medieval troubador Beatritz de Dia.Bessi√®res, Yves and Niedzwiecki, Patricia (October 1985).

Life Provenance and education Ronald Paris was born in Sondershausen, a small town in central Germany with a long tradition as an army town. His father was a stage actor and singer: his mother was a housewife, qualified as a seamstress. As the war drew to a close, formally ending in May 1945, Paris was rescued by advancing American troops from a fire in the cellar of the school in Sondershausen. In 2004, in commemoration of this event, which involved the rescuing of many families, he produced an altar tryptich for the Trinitatis Church in Sondershausen where, many years before, he had been baptized. He left school in 1948, which was the year of his parents' divorce, and started an apprenticeship in nearby Weimar focused on glass-art and Stained glass. By this time his urge to become a painter had become firmly rooted: between 1950 and 1952 he undertook appropriate studies, starting with evening classes at the Visual Arts Academy in Weimar and moving on, in 1951, to the Workers' and Peasants' faculty at Jena where he qualified for an entitlement to attend a university. He then undertook a brief internship/traineeship at the Castle Museum in Gotha. Between 1953 and 1958 he studied Mural painting at the Visual Arts Academy at Weissensee (Berlin). Here his teachers included , Arno Mohr, Bert Heller, Gabriele Mucchi and Toni Mau. Artistic and career development In 1959 he embarked on a career as a freelance artist. In the same year he undertook a 3,000 km (1,800 mile) study tour to the Soviet Union, which took him to the Volga and back. In 1961 he joined the National Association of Visual Artists, which was for many purposes a prerequisite for an artistic career in the German Democratic Republic. Much later, between 1985 and 1991 he served as the Association's regional president for the Berlin district. It was in this capacity that in 1989 he was a co- signatory of a declaration calling for the party to avoid violence during the succession of events that led, in October 1990, to German reunification. In 1961 his triptych, \\"Village Games in Wartenberg\\" (\\"Dorffestspiele in Wartenberg\\") was savagely criticised by the leadership of East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party, who insisted that his presentation of workers did not correspond with official idealised presentations. In 1962 Ronald Paris drew up the prestigious poster for the Brecht drama Schweik in the Second World War. Between 1963 and 1966 he was a \\"master-scholar\\" under Otto Nagel at the Berlin Arts Academy. In 1965 Ronald Paris was a co-founder of the \\"Intergrafik Treinnale\\", later becoming the event's president. In 1969 Busch painted the popular singer-actor Ernst Busch for a series entitled \\"Artists as seen by artists\\" (\\"K√ºnstler sehen K√ºnstler\\"). Two versions of the Busch portrait were produced, and the second of them was exhibited in the seventh National Art Exhibition in Dresden. The circumstances proved controversial because the \\"portrait\\" by Paris showed not Busch in a characteristically heroic pose, but as a tired old man. Ronald Paris received much criticism over the matter, not least from Ernst Busch who was furious. In the end the painting was purchased by the Ministry for Culture and was subject to a high- profile \\"disappearance\\". It is now considered \\"lost\\". Between 1993 and 1999 Ronald Paris was a professor at the \\"Burg Giebichenstein\\" Arts Acadademy in Halle. Since 1985 he has lived and worked in Rangsdorf near Berlin. Family and friends Between 1961 and 1974 Ronald Paris was married to the photographer Helga Paris. The marriage produced two recorded children, Robert (1962) and Jenny Helena (1964). Since 1985 he has been married to Isolde Paris. Their daughter, Anna Therese, was born in 1976. The landscape artist from Schwerin, Wilhelm Facklam, was his maternal uncle.Erinnerungen von Ronald Paris an seinen Onkel. In: Werner Stockfisch: Mecklenburg in Bildern von Wilhelm Facklam. Demmler Verlag, Schwerin 1993, . P. 8‚Äì10 & 65.

The film's sets were designed by the art directors Bernard Herzbrun and Nathan Juran. Plot A nine-year-old girl, Maggie Linaker, gets off a bus in Reno, Nevada and goes to find Norman Drake, a divorce lawyer there. Norman has just wrapped up a divorce case, after which Laura Carson, a stenographer in Judge Kneeland's court, scolds the lawyer for accepting payments over couples' breakups, rather than trying to steer them toward reconciliation. Maggie explains that she'd like to divorce her parents. She offers the lawyer all the money she has, $3.27. Norman accepts. Neither he nor Laura, however, can persuade the little girl to give them her parents' names or how they can be found. She just wants to divorce them. A clothing label mentioning a California town results in Norman finding the parents, Doris and Frederick Linaker, who are shocked to hear what their daughter has done. Maggie was supposed to be on a bus trip to a Nevada summer camp. It turns out Doris is pregnant and that she is not the birth mother of Maggie, who had been an abandoned child. A mock trial is held in Judge Kneeland's court, at which Maggie explains that she overheard her parents say they won't be able to afford to raise two children. Doris reassures her that was merely a worry, not a reason to leave. They return home, whereupon Norman and Laura begin to think they might like to have a try at this parenthood thing.

The film stars Lance Henriksen, Amy Hathaway, John Savage, Brian Krause and Dave Vescio. Plot In 2023, an unidentified spacecraft is found orbiting Neptune and an investigation is started. Meanwhile, Lisa (Amy Hathaway), a special agent for the DEA witnesses what she thinks is the death of her best friend, Manning (John Savage), during a drug raid. She quits her job to become a dance teacher, but is soon recruited again for a secret mission, and shipped off to a small remote island. On the island she finds out the secret mission is an investigation into the alien spacecraft that was found orbiting Neptune. She discovers two aliens were found; one small, one larger and of a different species, with the smaller alien (which looks somewhat like an underdeveloped foetus with typical 'grey alien' large eyes) controlling the much larger and robust one through telepathy. The team has nicknamed the larger alien 'Spike' due to its spiky and ominous appearance. Later, in attempting to escape or explore her surroundings, Lisa has a surprise meeting with her old friend Manning whom she had thought was dead. After a discussion with Colonel Cencula (Lance Henriksen) it comes to light that Lisa's sister also worked on the alien investigation but was killed through unknown circumstances (later revealed to be due to a mistaken overdose of the serum they're trying to develop), and that Lisa was chosen because of the natural psychic/telepathic link she shared with her twin sister. After seeing the smaller alien, which is imprisoned in a glass chamber, and forming a chance telepathic connection with it, Lisa is tested for a mental connection with her twin sister by Dr. Bainbridge (Dave Vescio). During the investigation Lisa meets Plummer (Brian Krause) and builds a friendship with him which soon blossoms into romance. Meanwhile, Colonel Cencula, Manning, and the doctor are working together to try and develop a serum to control people using the alien's telepathic technology. The Colonel sells this mind control technology to a North Korean billionaire for $4 billion. Lisa learns of the Colonel's plans, steals the access codes to the money/account, and attempts to flee the island. Colonel Cencula starts a hunt for Lisa and sends Plummer after her, but with Manning controlling him through their telepathy technology. Manning finds Lisa and attacks her but Lisa soon discerns it is really Manning via his obnoxious behavior, and begs Plummer to fight the mind control. Ultimately Plummer regains enough control to kill himself rather than risking harming Lisa. Enraged, Cencula kills Manning with a shot to the head for failing him. He then calls for a full evacuation of the island and releases the large alien, forcing Doctor Bainbridge to control 'Spike' to pursue Lisa. Fleeing from the alien, Lisa runs into a mine field and the alien sets off the mines causing a landslide, burying them both. The Colonel presumes they're dead, but both Lisa and the large alien are still alive as the little alien had managed to wrest control from the doctor and used \\"Spike\\" to protect Lisa from being crushed. The small alien informs Lisa telepathically that it wants her to help free both aliens. With help from the aliens Lisa defeats the military army on the island and they both confront the Colonel Cencula. Lisa begs him to stop the torture and release the aliens. When he emphatically refuses the large alien disarms him and rips him to shreds. Lisa frees both aliens and they escape as the island is set to self-destruct. The aliens thank and warn Lisa to quickly run, then take to their spaceship. Lisa is rescued from the island via a helicopter, relaying to the superior officer therein that the corrupt colonel and the experiment have been destroyed, that the aliens are 'gone,' and that it's best they take off before the whole island blows up. Meanwhile, somewhere below, in a somewhat cryptic scene, Dr. Bainbridge is seen rowing down a river with a metal suitcase and what appears to be the comatose body of Lisa's twin sister. As the entire island blows, a spaceship takes off back into space...

Odinet Sr. (born October 9, 1930) is a retired businessman from Arabi in St. Bernard Parish in suburban New Orleans, Louisiana, who is a former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. As a Democrat, he represented District 103, encompassing Orleans and St. Bernard parishes, from 1988 to 2008. In 2008, he switched parties and ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Another Republican, Eric Skrmetta, won the election and remains on the commission. In 2015, Odinet is still a registered Republican. Background In 1951 and 1957, Odinet received bachelor's and master's degrees, respectively, from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.\\"Louisiana: Odinet Sr., Kenneth L.\\", Who's Who in American Politics, 2007-2008 (Marquis Who's Who: New Providence, New Jersey, 2007), p. 668. From 1952 to 1954, he served in the United States Army and attended infantry school at Fort Benning, Georgia. He was an engineer from 1954 to 1957, a construction engineer/manager from 1958 to 1973, and a consulting engineer/contractor from 1973 to 1986. In 1957, he wed the former Rosemary Popich (also born October 1930). The Roman Catholic couple has thirteen children. Odinet is affiliated with the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Association of Retired Persons. Elections Odinet ran unsuccessfully for the state House in 1983, when he finished third to the incumbent Edward S. Bopp and the runoff election winner, Republican Edward Ripoll. Four years later on November 21, 1987, he unseated Ripoll, best known as the owner of the popular Bud Rip's Bar in New Orleans. Odinet polled 6,160 votes (59.1 percent) to Ripoll's 4,269 (40.9 percent). Four other candidates, all Democrats, were eliminated in the primary election held a month earlier. Odinet won reelection over two Democrats in 1991 with 56.4 percent of the vote. He went on to defeat with ease the Republicans Pamela Nevle in 1995 and Robert Breaud Jr. in 1999 and 2003. In 2007, Odinet, still a Democrat, ran for the District 1 seat in the Louisiana State Senate, vacated by Walter Boasso, who instead ran unsuccessfully as a Republican-turned-Democrat for Governor of Louisiana against Bobby Jindal. Odinet lost the Senate race to State Representative A. G. Crowe of Pearl River in St. Tammany Parish, 11,625 (52 percent) to 10,811 (48 percent). In the 2008 race for the Public Service Commissioner, Odinet narrowly lost a general election berth with the front- running candidate, former Commissioner John F. Schwegmann, an Independent, by 736 votes. He received 33,470 votes (22.6 percent) to Schwegmann's 61,711 (41.8 percent). Schwegmann entered the runoff with Eric Skrmetta, the primary runner-up who received 34,206 ballots (23.1 percent). Another Independent or No Party candidate, Bruce C.

Primary services include telehealth, medical opinions, AI and analytics, and licensable platform services. In particular, Teladoc Health uses telephone and videoconferencing software as well as mobile apps to provide on-demand remote medical care. Billed as the first and largest telemedicine company in the United States, Teladoc Health was launched in 2002 and has acquired companies such as BetterHelp in 2015, Best Doctors in 2017, and Advance Medical in 2018. It trades on the NYSE and in 2019 was active in 130 countries and served around 27 million members.  History   2002-2008  Teladoc was founded in 2002 in Dallas, Texas by G.Byron Brooks EE MD and Michael Gorton. Billing itself as the oldest telemedicine company in United States, Teladoc's initial business model allowed patients to remotely consult with state-licensed doctors at any time. Companies paid a monthly fee for their employees to access the service, while patients paid a flat fee for each consultation, originally about $35 to $40. With Gorton as both chairman and CEO, Teladoc launched nationally in 2005 at the Consumer Directed Health Care Conference in Chicago, Illinois. Teladoc had around 1 million members by the end of 2007, with large employers such as AT&T; providing the service to employees as a health benefit.  2009-2014  Jason Gorevic was named Teladoc's chief executive in 2009. The company's initial private funding rounds raised $9 million in December 2009, $4 million in January 2011, and $18.6 million in September 2011. That year, Aetna began offering Teladoc for its fully insured members in Florida and Texas, later offering Teladoc in all 50 states. Teladoc acquired Consult A Doctor for $16.6 million cash in August 2013, allowing smaller companies to access Teladoc's services. At the time, Teladoc completed 120,000 consults annually. Teladoc raised $15 million in September 2013, with total funding at that point equaling $46.6 million. The Affordable Care Act led to a large number of insurance companies signing with Teladoc, resulting in a growth surge around 2014. By that time, insurance companies such as Blue Shield of California and Oscar had signed with Teladoc, as well as other companies such as Home Depot, T-Mobile, CalPERS, and Rent-A-Center. Teladoc acquired AmeriDoc for $17.2 million in May 2014. The acquisitions of Consult A Doctor and AmeriDoc, both Teladoc's main competitors, resulted in Teladoc becoming the largest telemedicine provider in the United States. With 8 million individual patients, Teladoc's doctors performed 299,000 consults that year. Teladoc's sales doubled in both 2013 and 2014, and Teladoc raised $50 million from private investors in September 2014, bringing total funding to $100 million.  2015-2016  thumb The company acquired BetterHelp in January 2015 for $3.5 million, followed by Stat Health Services, Inc. (StatDoc) in June 2015 for $30 million. After beginning the process that April, Teladoc went public on the New York Stock Exchange on July 1, 2015. The only telemedicine company on the NYSE, Teladoc's initial public offering listed at $19 per share, giving the company a market capitalization of $758 million and an enterprise value of $620 million. The initial response to the IPO was positive, as shares surged 50 percent on the opening day. Three months after the IPO, health insurer Highmark, which represented 1.5% of Teladoc's 2015 revenue, ceased to renew a contract. Teladoc shares fell significantly as a result, before rising to earlier levels. Teladoc acquired the behavioral health services provider Compile Inc. in January 2015, followed by the competitor Stat Health Services Inc. in June 2015. In 2016 Teladoc began aggressively expanding, acquiring other companies and launching health segments for dermatology, behavioral health, and sexual health. That year the company won a patent infringement lawsuit filed against competitor American Well. In July 2016, Teladoc acquired HealthiestYou for $45 million. Teladoc had 15 million members by November 2016 and a market share of 75% in the United States. It also operated its full service suite in 48 states, excluding Arkansas and Texas. In December 2016, the American Hospital Association exclusively endorsed Teladoc's telehealth technology platform. Teladoc logged 952,000 patient visits that year.  2017-2020  In its largest acquisition at the time, in 2017 Teladoc spent $440 million purchasing Best Doctors, a medical consultation firm and provider of medical second opinions and pay-to-play medical award listings. On February 28, 2019, non-profit group ProPublica released a report critical of companies like subsidiary Best Doctors that sell physician awards, including \\"Best Doctors\\" awards. Teladoc had 7,500 clients in 2017, of which 220 were Fortune 1000 companies. Sales that year were $233 million, 89% higher than the year prior. As of July 2018, Teladoc Health brands included Teladoc, Advance Medical, Best Doctors, BetterHelp and HealthiestYou. With a market capitalization of $4.1 billion, on August 10, 2018, Teladoc, Inc. changed its name to Teladoc Health, Inc. while continuing to trade on the NYSE. Teladoc Health began partnering with CVS in August 2018 on remote consults at MinuteClinics. In December 2018, Teladoc Health's chief financial officer and chief operating officer Mark Hirschhorn resigned after a report that he engaged in a sexual relationship and insider trading with an employee.Teladoc Health CFO resigns amid allegations of misconduct December 19, 2018 According to Yahoo Finance, stock value fell roughly 20% in the days following, while an investor class action lawsuit alleged that Teladoc Health had violated securities laws by failing to disclose Hirschhorn's behavior. Teladoc Health denied making false statements or any legal violations. Joining from American Express, Mala Murthy was appointed CFO in June 2019. In late 2018, Teladoc Health acquired the telemedicine company Advance Medical for $352 million, which employed doctors in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. In 2019, the French health company M√©decinDirect was acquired. In April 2019, Teladoc launched in Canada with the Teladoc Telemedicine Service. In May 2019, the company created a virtual care patient safety organization (PSO) dubbed the Institute for Patient Safety and Quality of Virtual Care. Currently headquartered in Purchase, New York, as of 2019, the company was active in 130 countries and had around 27 million members. David Sides was appointed COO in 2019. In January 2020, Teladoc announced that it had reached an agreement to pay $600 million to acquire InTouch Health. In August of the same year, the business announced it would acquire Livongo Health for $18.5 billion.https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-livongo-health-m-a-teladoc- health/teladoc-bets-big-on-online-medicine-with-18-5-billion-livongo-deal- idUKKCN2511ET  Services and business model  Teladoc Health divides its services into six categories: platform and program services, guidance and support, expert medical services, mental health services, telehealth, and integrated virtual care. As a software company, Teladoc Health is involved with artificial intelligence, analytics, and \\"licensable platform services.\\" The company primarily uses telephone and videoconferencing software to provide on-demand remote medical care, with patients able to log on to the service at any time and be connected with a board-certified, state-licensed physician within several minutes. The company's physicians treat non-emergencies such as the flu, pink eye, infections, sinus issues, mental health issues, and dermatological conditions, among others. The company has an expert network of 55,000 involved in 450 medical subspecialties. While medication can be prescribed remotely, physicians do not prescribe narcotics or \\"lifestyle\\" drugs such as Viagra, and refer some cases to clinics or emergency rooms. In 2014, Teladoc Health reported that it sent around 1% of consultations to the emergency room, and around 6% to a primary care physician or urgent care center. In 2019, the company also claimed that 92% of medical issues were resolved after the first visit.https://www.teladoc.com/ Physicians overall follow \\"more than 100 proprietary clinical guidelines\\" developed by Teladoc Health, and are prohibited from physically meeting their telemedicine patients. Teams of nurses review around 10% of each physician's consults monthly. Contracting largely with insurers and large employers, Teladoc Health generates revenue through a yearly or monthly fee charged per subscriber, as well as a fee for individual consults. Some companies waive or subsidize the consult fee for their employees. Teladoc Health has around 3,100 licensed physicians and nurses and services offered in about 30 languages.  Lobbying and legislation  Teladoc Health has been involved in lobbying for legislation in several states. In 2015 the Texas Medical Board ruled that state physicians had to physically meet patients before remotely treating ailments or prescribing medication. The bill undermined Teladoc Health's business model in Texas, where it had around 2 million subscribers. Teladoc Health sued in federal court over the rule in Teladoc v. Texas Medical Board, arguing the bill violated antitrust laws by inflating prices and limiting the supply of health care providers in the state. The bill, meant to go active on June 3, 2015, was stalled while the lawsuit went through a federal appeals court, allowing Teladoc Health to continue operating in Texas in the interim. Teladoc voluntarily dropped the lawsuit in 2017 after Texas passed a new bill allowing for remote treatment without a prior in-person interaction, which Teladoc Health had lobbied heavily for. In January 2019, Teladoc Health opposed a telemedicine bill proposed by the North Dakota Board of Medicine, which required telemedicine providers to perform initial video examinations or have initial exams done by another physician. Proponents argued the bill protected patients, while Teladoc Health and critics argued it decreased access to healthcare in rural areas. The year prior, Teladoc Health had completed 1,500 virtual visits in the state.

Biography  Antsiferov was born in the estate of Count Potocki in Uman, Ukraine. His father, Pavel Grigor'evich Antsiferov (1815‚Äì1897) was a state counsellor and the son of a naval officer in Arkhangelsk, who took a post as an inspector of agriculture and horticulture at an institute in Uman, and later was the director of the Nikitsky Botanical Garden in Crimea from 1891. He was buried in the cemetery in Sofeiskaia Slobodka. His mother, Ekaterina Maksinovna n√©e Petrova, was the daughter of a Tver peasant. She was born in 1853 in Saint Petersburg and died in 1933. Following the death of his father, Nikolai Antsiferov lived with his mother in Pulavy (in present-day Poland), and then in Kiev where he studied at the first Kiev Gymnasium. Beginning in 1908 he studied in Saint Petersburg from 1908, graduating in 1909. Beginning in 1915 he studied at the historical- philological department of Petrograd Imperial University, where I. M. Grevs was his teacher. After graduating university, Antsiferov remained in the department of general history until 1919. His pedagogical career began directly after his university graduation: the women's gymnasium of N. N. Zvorskaya (1915‚Äì1916), the private school of A. S. Cherniaev (1915‚Äì1918), a school at the former Tenishevsii college (1918‚Äì1925), where he led a humanitarian circle, at the second pedagogical institute (1919‚Äì1926), in a boarding school for street children in Pavlovsk (1919‚Äì1920) at the Institute of Art History (1925‚Äì1929). In 1917 he wrote in his diary: :17 October. It is dark and crowded on the streets. It is terrible to look at them. Each coming day brings blood. The Bolsheviks forge their uprising and we await it obediently like a force of fate. :24 October. A new act is beginning in a cruel Russian tragedy. :25 October. The October Revolution. Difficult thoughts wander in my soul like clouds. Love for human personality and faith in the eternal remain. I see that this does not depend on any kind of event.

A total of 91 founders established S√§llskapet, which opened on 1 December 1800.http://www.sallskapet.se/content/s√§llskapet- brief The founders established a rule book and constitution for their society, aiming to recreate the ethos and success of top London clubs such as White's. Clubhouse On 31 March 1870 S√§llskapet relocated into a new purpose-built clubhouse in central Stockholm, on the opposite bank of the river from the Swedish Parliament and the Royal Palace. The Club remains at this location, No 7 Arsenalsgatan, to the present day. The architect was Johan Fredrik √Öbom a leading proponent of his art in mid-nineteenth century Stockholm. √Öbom had also designed the world-renowned Hotel Rydberg (where the Club then met), whose banqueting hall was considered one of the greatest architectural triumphs of nineteenth century Stockholm, and which gave its name to the now classical Swedish dish \\"Biff Rydberg\\".One example of the recipe on-line. The members commissioned √Öbom to construct a clubhouse including an exact replica of the Hotel Rydberg banqueting hall. As the hotel no longer exists, the main dining room at S√§llskapet is the only place where Biff Rydberg may be eaten in its original setting. Membership Membership of S√§llskapet is limited to 2,000, and there are more applications for membership than available places. The King of Sweden King Carl XVI Gustaf is a club member and patron of the club. Prince Carl Philip, Duke of V√§rmland is an honorary member.

The film is being produced by Elred Kumar and features Bobby Simha and Nikki Galrani in the leading roles, while Prakash Raj reprises his role from the first film. Bala Saravanan, Ilavarasu, and John Vijay play supporting roles. The music was composed by Leon James with editing by Richard Kevin. This film is a remake of the 2014 Telugu political thriller film Prathinidhi, starring Nara Rohit. A stand-alone sequel to the successful 2011 film Ko, the film was planned to release in April 2016 but released on 13 May 2016. Plot A common man named Kumaran (Bobby Simha) kidnaps the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Yogeeswaran (Prakash Raj), at a private old age home event in Chennai. The news goes viral, and everyone from the local to the central cabinet starts taking the issue personally. Home Minister Thillainayagam (Ilavarasu) appoints Santhanapandian (John Vijay), the Police Commissioner of Tirunelveli, to rescue Yogeeswaran. Santhanapandian questions Bala (Bala Saravanan), a minister's son who was discovered unconscious at the scene of the kidnapping. Bala tells that he and Kumaran had become friends when Kumaran had saved him from a group of thugs, but they are shocked to see that they both of them love the same girl - Priyadharshini (Nikki Galrani). Bala also reveals that Kumaran willingly allowed him to pursue his relationship with Priyadharshini in exchange for making arrangements for Yogeeswaran to attend the old age home event. Meanwhile, as Santhanapandian and his deputy, ACP Arivazhagan (Bharath Reddy), strive to get clues about Kumaran, Kumaran explains to Yogeeswaran his motive for kidnapping him. Kumaran was an orphan, but due to the efforts of an honest politician named Kumaraswamy (Nassar), who had sponsored him, he got a good education and became a journalist with the News7 TV channel. When he went to Kumaraswamy's house to thank him for his contribution to his life, he found out that Kumaraswamy had gone missing for many days. On further investigation, he learned that Kumaraswamy had been buried alive by Thillainayagam and his sons Kishore (Shan) and Prathap. Thillainayagam had contested against Kumaraswamy in the last election and had defeated him by rigging the vote, which forced Kumaraswamy to file a case against him and demand a recount. When Kumaraswamy refused to withdraw the case against him, Thillainayagam and his sons buried him alive. Kumaran then filed a case against Thillainayagam and asked Kumaraswamy's intellectually disabled son, also named Kumaran (Karunakaran), who was unaware that his father had been killed, to give the statement to the police inspector. However, the police inspector was Thillainayagam's aide and informed him about Kumaran. Thillainayagam's sons then took Kumaran on a bus and pushed him out en route. He was then run over by a lorry and died. In order to avenge the deaths of Kumaraswamy and his son, Kumaran hatched a plan with Priyadharshini and Bala to kidnap Yogeeswaran in order to expose Thillainayagam slowly through false media reports based on false replies by Bala while being interrogated by the police. In the process, Thillainayagam's sons are taken into questioning. After being tortured, they eventually give in and expose Thillainayagam as Kumaraswamy's murderer, even giving them the location in Thillainayagam's lawn where Kumaraswamy was buried. Thillainayagam is arrested, and Kumaran releases Yogeeswaran. Kumaran also escapes from his hideout and poses as a journalist, while Yogeeswaran says that he cannot identify the kidnapper. Even Santhanapandian gives up on pursuing the kidnapper as the latter had kidnapped Yogeeswaran with good intentions.

The novel, published in 1965, is the first in his so- called \\"Israeli trilogy\\", a series of novels following the exploits of Jacob and Robert, con-artists who prey on women. Background H≈Çasko, who had left Communist Poland in 1958, landed in Israel in 1959. Unable to find work or fit into Israeli society, he lived as a vagrant, though his income from previous publications staved off destitution. By 1960 he had moved again, to West Germany. The semi-autobiographical Killing the Second Dog was published in 1965, followed the next year by Nawr√≥cony w Jaffie (\\"Converted in Jaffa\\"). The third part of the trilogy is the novella Opowiem wam o Esther (\\"I want to tell you about Esther\\"). Content Jacob (in whom we should see the author, according to Arnon Grunberg) and Robert are con men in Tel Aviv who prey on single women who visit Israel. The con starts with Jacob, posing as a sensitive and helpless man, gaining the women's trust and manipulating them into \\"saving\\" him. He then pretends, racked by guilt over an event in his past, to want to commit suicide; he doesn't, but instead kills his dog to indicate how emotionally destitute he is. Publication and translations An English translation by Tomasz Mirkowicz was published by Cane Hill Press c. 1990, and republished (with an introduction by Lesley Chamberlain) in 2014 by New Vessel Press. The entire trilogy was published in Dutch, translated by Karol Lesman and Gerard Rasch, with an afterword by Arnon Grunberg (whose first venture, a publishing company, had published Lesman's translation of I want to tell you about Esther).

This rather ineffective locomotive with only one driving axle was built in 1887 by the Hinkley Locomotive Works in Boston for the Swinerton Locomotive Driving Wheel Company.Thinking Outside the Circle: A Locomotive with Non-Circular Wheels. History In 1887 the Swinerton Locomotive Driving Wheel Company in the U.S.A. received a unique locomotive boldly called Onward, which had been built by the Hinkley Locomotive Works of Boston. Its unique feature was that its wheels were not round. The company's founder, C. E. Swinerton, had specified that both driving wheels should actually polygons with 118 sides, each flat segment being about 2 inches (50mm) long. He wanted to prove that the line contact at the intersection of each segment would have better rail adhesion than a circular wheel, which was supposed to have only a point contact. However this was actually not the case as even steel deforms under enough pressure, so there is on fact a contact area even with a circular wheel. The 4-2-2 locomotive had one single driving axle. This wheel arrangement had been abandoned elsewhere because of its poor adhesion. Probably it was chosen to emphasise the effectiveness of the invention. The Onward was tried on several north-eastern lines, but did not prove to be beneficial, and thus failed to convince practical railway men. It is likely that the non-constant radius would have caused tremendous amount of vibration. It was sold to the Portland and Rochester Railroad, after the polygonal driving wheels had been replaced with conventional round ones. After a few years the P & R sent it to the Manchester Locomotive Works for reconstruction as an ordinary eight-wheeler. Onward was cut up for scrap in 1905.

He was one of the leaders of the Indian Passive Resistance Campaign of 1946 and the Defiance Campaign in 1952. The Government of India awarded the fourth highest Indian civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1977. Biography Ismail Ahmed Cachalia was born in the South African province of Transvaal on 5 December 1908 to Khatija (Naani) and Sheth Ahmad Mohammad Cachalia, an anti apartheid campaigner and a businessman of Indian origin who was in prison at the time of Ismail's birth. The senior Cachalia was the chairman of the Transvaal British Indian Association who was forced into bankruptcy due to his connection with the organization and the young Ismail grew up amidst anti apartheid struggles. He completed his primary education up to class 5 at Bree Street Indian School, Johannesburg and moved to Uttar Pradesh in India, and studied Scriptures and Arabic at the Muslim Theological college in Deoband to become an Aalim (priest). He is reported to have participated in the non-cooperation movement in India during that time but returned to South Africa in 1931 to join his brother, Yusuf Cachalia, in family business. In the 1930s, he and his brother joined with Yusuf Dadoo and Monty Naicker, in their anti apartheid activities mobilizing youths for militant action but later changed to non violent methods and became one of the leaders of the Indian Passive Resistance Movement which led to the arrest of over 2000 Indians in 1946. However the movement helped in uniting African National Congress and the Indian resistance group together which was formalized by the Dadoo-Naicker-Xuma Pact of 1947. During the next six years, Cachalia worked with other leaders of the African National Congress, including Nelson Mandela and Albert Lutuli, in the non violent struggle against the oppression of the apartheid regime and led the Defiance Campaign of 1952 as its Deputy Volunteer-in-Chief; Nelson Mandela was the Volunteer-in Chief. He was arrested and sentenced to a suspended 18 months in prison, subject to keeping away from political activities. In 1955, he attended the Afro-Asian Conference in Bandung as a delegate of the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress, along with Moses Kotane. On the way to the conference, Cachalia had the opportunity to meet V. K. Krishna Menon at London and Jawaharlal Nehru at Delhi. He was detained at Cairo for a brief period on his return to South Africa, but continued his activities and, after the Sharpeville massacre of 1960 which resulted in the death of 69 people, he escaped, in order to escape incarceration, to India via Botswana. In India, he established the ANC Mission in Delhi, along with Alfred Nzo who would later become the first foreign minister of post apartheid South Africa. Cachalia became the deputy chief representative of the Mission. By 1972, Cachalia retired from active politics due to ill health and shifted his residence to Kala Kacha, Navsari in the Indian state of Gujarat where his ancestors came from, but divided his time between the two countries. After the dismantling of apartheid regime, ANC requested him to take part in their campaign in the first general election with universal suffrage in 1994 which he could not. He was present at the function of the dedication of the memorials of Thillaiaadi Valliammai and Swami Nagappen Padayachee to the nation at the Braamfontein cemetery on 15 July 1914 along with Walter Sisulu and also during Jyoti Basu's visit to Johannesburg in 1997. He died on 8 August 2003 at the age of 94. Cachalia was married to Rabia and the couple had one son, Yehia and seven daughters, Mariam, Amina, Saeedah, Hafsa, Rashida, Daya and Khaleeda Dockrat; Khaleeda preceded him in death by one year. His mortal remains were buried at Bethal, a town known for potato farming in Mpumalanga, South Africa. Cachalia received the World Peace Council Prize in 1955. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1977. Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Conversations With Myself, carries a short biography of Ismail Cachalia.

Endemic to the Serran√≠a del Perij√° mountain range on the Colombia‚ÄìVenezuela border, the Perij√° tapaculo is found at altitudes of . It measures , and its tail is around long. Specimens have long been stored in museums, but the species was only described in 2015 based on sixteen specimens found between July 2008 and February 2009. It is considered vulnerable. Adults have neutral grey heads, brown necks, brown- sepia striped backs, and grey-white bellies, breasts, and throats. Males have some buff markings on their breasts, and less sharp brown spots on their napes than females. The Perij√° tapaculo is a secretive bird and therefore difficult to observe; as a result its ecology is poorly known. It feeds on insects and reproduces between April and July. Its range is partially within Chamicero de Perij√° Bird Reserve in Colombia and the Sierra de Perij√° National Park in Venezuela. Taxonomy Tapaculos are the most primitive family of suboscines, divided into 12 genera containing 60 species. Scytalopus, the genus to which the Perij√° tapaculo belongs, has an abundance of similar species, many of which are difficult to classify through appearance. Some individual species from other genera are like Scytalopus in size and plumage, but have different behaviour and morphological features. Vocal studies and mitochondrial DNA analysis are often used to differentiate between species within the genus; a number of visually identical species previously classified as subspecies of the Magellanic tapaculo (S. magellanicus) have been identified through these methods, and the majority of subspecies within the genus have subsequently been reclassified as separate species. Between 1941 and 1942, American ornithologist Melbourne Armstrong Carriker collected 27 specimens of the Perij√° tapaculo in six locations on the western side of the Serran√≠a del Perij√°. He identified them as specimens of the northern white-crowned tapaculo (S. atratus), despite size and colour differences, and sent them to the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. In 1953, the specimens began to attract the attention of biologists, and were successively identified as the brown-rumped tapaculo (S. latebricola), the Caracas tapaculo (S. caracae), and the M√©rida tapaculo (S. meridanus). Some further believed that the specimens could belong to an undescribed species, or constitute a subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo (S. griseicollis) or the M√©rida tapaculo based on morphological studies, but they were never classified as any of these. In September 2006, biologists Juan Pablo L√≥pez and Alexander Cort√©s Diago found two specimens in a cloud forest at an altitude of on the western side of the Serran√≠a del Perij√° in Colombia, but the information collected was insufficient to identify a new species. Between July 2008 and February 2009, sixteen new specimens were collected in an area previously explored by Carriker. New vocal, morphological, genetic, and ecological studies of these specimens confirmed that they constituted a new species, Scytalopus perijanus, first described by Jorge Enrique Avenda√±o et al. on 11 March 2015 following a three-year expedition, and accepted by the South American Classification Committee. The Latin word perijanus refers to the Serran√≠a del Perij√° mountain range, and the genus name Scytalopus comes from the Greek skutale (stick) and pous (foot). The type specimen of the Perij√° tapaculo, an adult male, was found in the Serran√≠a del Perij√° near the El Cinco vereda of Manaure, Cesar Department, Colombia, at an altitude of . Jorge Enrique Avenda√±o lured the specimen by playing a recording of its song on 10 July 2008 at the edge of a montane forest. Sequence analysis of the mitochondrial gene ND2 from the Perij√° tapaculo showed that its nearest relatives are the brown-rumped tapaculo, Caracas tapaculo, and M√©rida tapaculo. Description alt=Image showing a juvenile Perij√° tapaculo The Perij√° tapaculo is a small bird, in length with an average mass of 17 to 18 grams (around 0.6 oz). The bill averages long, wide, and high. The legs are about long. The Perij√° tapaculo's tarsus averages long. The wings measure on average and the tail is about long with between 8 and 12 rectrices. The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and scapular area are a neutral grey colour. There is a brown spot on the nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and the bottom of their breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks. The bird's plumage colouration is most similar to the pale-bellied tapaculo. The S. g. morenoi subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo can be differentiated from the Perij√° tapaculo by its entirely brown back and nape, and its different calls. Juveniles of this subspecies have a dull ventral plumage, while the Perij√° tapaculo has a more yellow plumage. It also resembles the Caracas tapaculo but has a duller ventral colour. Ecology and behaviour Song and call Like other species in genus Scytalopus, the Perij√° tapaculo is secretive and therefore difficult to observe. The call and song differ from those of most other species in the genus, and the latter is composed of two short churrs repeating up to 65 times at 0.5 to 3 second intervals. The diet of the species is little known, but studies of the stomach contents of seven specimens suggested that they fed exclusively on insects. Little is known about the reproduction of the species, but it is believed to nest between April and July. The species builds its globular nests in underground cavities about in diameter and around in height, lined with mosses, grasses, and plant roots around a central space about wide. The nests are accessed by a short tunnel with a depth of and a diameter of . Young birds may leave the nest at the end of June. Like those of other Scytalopus species, male specimens have demonstrated involvement in parenting. Distribution and habitat alt=Mountain range Serran√≠a del Perij√° The Perij√° tapaculo is endemic to the Serran√≠a del Perij√°, a mountain range on the Colombia‚ÄìVenezuela border known for its high rates of endemism. It has been observed in nineteen localities on both sides of the border between altitudes of above sea level; in its northern range, there are no suitable forests below . The bird has been observed at on the Venezuelan side, and at 1,6003,225 m on the Colombian side. The Perij√° tapaculo lives in and on the edges of humid rainforests, as well as in elfin forests and amongst woody p√°ramo shrubs in high-mountain grassland areas, especially at altitudes of . Some specimens have been observed feeding in dense thickets within of the ground, often near the forest. Others have been observed running through open grassy areas between bushes. The species has not been identified as being sympatric with any other species of the genus Scytalopus. However, there is a possibility that its range overlaps with that of the S. atratus nigricans, which occupies a different micro-habitat on the eastern side of the Serran√≠a del Perij√° at altitudes of ; or that it may be found within the range of the pale-bellied tapaculo in the lower reaches of the Serran√≠a de Los Motilones mountain range, south of the Serran√≠a del Perij√°. Threats and protection Jorge Enrique Avenda√±o et al. wrote in the original description of the Perij√° tapaculo that the size and quality of the species' range are being reduced, although it can tolerate a certain level of fragmentation of its range. Its natural habitat covers about . The description entails the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classification of this species as vulnerable. The authors believe that to protect the Perij√° tapaculo, conservation measures on the Colombian side of the border should reflect those on the Venezuelan side, as the forests of the Serran√≠a del Perij√° have been largely destroyed on the Colombian side by logging activities and forest clearance for agriculture. On 28 January 2014, prior to the formal description of the bird, the Chamicero de Perij√° Bird Reserve was created by Fundaci√≥n ProAves to maintain one of Colombia's most fragile habitats. In addition to the Perij√° tapaculo, several other Perij√°- endemic endangered species, such as the Perij√° metaltail (Metallura iracunda) and Perij√° thistletail (Asthenes perijana) are protected within this reserve's . The Colombian section of the Serran√≠a del Perij√° is dangerous for scientific excursions due to the presence of the FARC guerrilla group in the region. In Venezuela, the Sierra de Perij√° National Park covers and partially protects the habitat of the Perij√° tapaculo.

The investigation, led by West Mercia Police, commenced in 2013 and has subsequently been declared a major incident. According to ArtWatch UK ‚Äî an organisation which campaigns for the protection of works of art and architecture ‚Äî the investigation has uncovered \\"the systematic plundering of churches in England and Wales [that] has gone largely unnoticed for up to ten years.\\" Detective Inspector Martyn Barnes, head of the operation, said: \\"Some of the items that have been taken are described as priceless because they are unique. Some of them may fetch tens of thousands of pounds on the black market; others go for ¬£50, ¬£60. We believe that some of these crimes date back to 2002‚Äî2003.\\" International art crime is \\"a $6 billion a year business\\" according to the United Nations, and \\"the fourth most lucrative sector in international crime after drugs, money laundering and illegal arms shipments.\\" Around 8% of all stolen art worldwide is taken from churches. In England and Wales the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Heritage and Cultural Property Crime Working Group estimates the theft of art and antiques to be worth around ¬£300 million, \\"second only to drug dealing and more costly than the theft of stolen vehicles.\\" History Operation Icarus was launched in 2013 by West Mercia Police (WMP) following the recovery by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) of several stolen religious artefacts. The MPS had received information from HM Revenue and Customs relating to the illegal importation of a gorilla's head by an art collector in South London. When police confronted the collector they also found two 15th century decorative oak panels and a 13th-century stone memorial. The oak panels, depicting St Victor of Marseille and St Margaret of Antioch, were identified as priceless parts of a medieval rood screen from Holy Trinity Church, Torbryan, Devon, and had been stolen in August 2013. The stone was identified as a \\"heart stone\\" which had marked the place where the Bishop of Hereford John de Breton's heart was interred in the wall of Dore Abbey, Golden Valley, Herefordshire. It had been stolen in September 2012. As the force responsible for Herefordshire, WMP took over and interviewed the collector, widening the investigation to include art dealers and internet sales. The operation discovered that \\"for at least six years, and more likely for a decade, a person ‚Äî or persons ‚Äî had been targeting remote, often unlocked, churches and stripping them of precious artefacts.\\" Searching eBay, police discovered at least one stolen artefact for sale on the internet auction site: a 14th- century stone carving depicting the head of Robert de Wakering, stolen from All Saints Church, Newland, Gloucestershire, in 2012. Detective Sergeant Andy Bennett said that while some thieves are \\"taking pot luck and taking whatever they can steal\\" others are stealing specific items to order. DI Barnes said that art dealers purchasing stolen artefacts \\"were not doing enough to ensure that objects were on the market legitimately.... Our general consensus is that their records are woefully inadequate. They say they comply with the law and they probably do ‚Äî just ‚Äî but do they turn a blind eye? I would say, yes they do.\\" Recovered artefacts One of the recovered medieval misericords stolen from St Cuthbert's Church, Holme Lacy, Herefordshire Police raids in London, Wales and Kent led to the recovery of around 60 stolen artefacts including stonework, tombstone lids, friezes, statues, paintings, brasses, stained glass panels and 17th-century Bibles. Detective Constable Tony Lewis said that by mid-2015 police were holding over 60 recovered items which were still to be identified and may not even have been reported stolen, adding: \\"Some items are very small and some have been removed from dark corners or high up in walls.

With music composed by Ilayaraaja, the Kannada version released first on 26 February 2016 while the Tamil version released on July 1, 2016. Plot The film opens with a man running away in fear, looking over his shoulder the whole time. He is hit by a car while on the run and is admitted to the hospital in a coma. The Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Shakthivel is called upon to investigate the matter, where it is found through the security cameras that a corpse of a high profile businesswoman Maaya is missing from the morgue. Meanwhile, Maaya's husband Akshay is surrounded by his family and friends offering their condolences but he drives them out saying he wants to be left alone. Once they all leave, he drives to his girlfriend Bhumika aka Bhumi's house, where it is revealed Akshay killed his wife and made it look like a heart attack. The police call Akshay over his cell phone and ask him to come to the forensics lab and explain the issue. Akshay drinks a glass of water offered by Bhumi and he leaves. Akshay is asked to stay in the lab until they discover the corpse. In a series of clues and flashbacks, Akshay is made to believe that Maaya is still alive and is out for revenge. He keeps in contact with Bhumi the entire time, until Shakthivel gets evidence that can allow him to arrest Akshay, in the form of a toxin BL-18 that can induce a heart attack. He interrogates Akshay and Akshay reveals how Maaya and him met the first time. After getting locked up in a room, Akshay calls up Bhumi and finds out that Maaya's lawyer Krishna Prasad is in fact a private detective hired by Maaya to spy on Akshay. He asks Bhumi to run away afraid that Maaya is after her. When Bhumi comes out of the building, a car comes speeding towards her and Akshay fears the worst. He confesses everything to Shakthivel and repeatedly requests him to save Bhumi. Shakthivel gets a call from Deva who says they've found a body, revealed to be Maaya. Shakthivel further confirms that there was no one called Bhumi in the university Akshay mentioned neither in the flat he had gone to and that Bhumi was non-existent. Akshay tries to run away, tailed by Shakthivel. Shakthivel then reveals that the car accident in which Shakthivel's wife had died was caused by a drunken Akshay and Maaya. Although Shakthivel's daughter Amritha repeatedly calls for help, Maaya tells Akshay to leave them be, due to which wife dies. Amritha had been in a coma for two years and when she woke up, she remembers the car license plate, which she tells her father, who tracks them down. It is revealed in a twist that Bhumi is actually the adult Amritha, Shakthivel's daughter, and this was an elaborate plan orchestrated by Shakthivel and Amritha due to which Maaya was killed. Shakthivel further reveals that the glass of water Amritha had offered Akshay before leaving contained BL-18 and it has been eight hours since it entered his bloodstream. Akshay then dies by a heart attack and Shakthivel walks away from his body.

His studies of the function of cardiac muscle cells during the 1960s shaped the basis of both cardiovascular physiology and the modern treatment of cardiovascular disease, making possible the development of ACE inhibitors. In 1962, he was also credited as the first person to image the heart muscle under scientifically-controlled conditions using the electron microscope. Though Sonnenblick's ideas about the relationship between the structure and function of the human heart today constitute medical-scientific commonsense, they were utterly novel at the time. Reflecting on Sonnenblick's discoveries, Harvard cardiologist Eugene Braunwald wrote that \\"Ed Sonnenblick occupies an honored place along with Ernest Starling, Carl Wiggers, and very few others in the pantheon of the greatest cardiovascular physiologists of the twentieth century.\\" After Sonnenblick's death in 2007, a tribute published in the prominent peer- reviewed journal Circulation Research remembered Sonnenblick as \\"simply an intellectual giant in the field of cardiovascular research, and the work that he did will forever shape everyday treatments of heart disease.\\" Early life Sonnenblick was born in New Haven, Connecticut on December 7, 1932 to Israel \\"Ira\\" and Rosalind Sonnenblick. Sonnenblick grew up in Hartford, Connecticut, and after graduating as the salutatorian of his high school class, he attended Wesleyan University. Career After completing his B.A. at Wesleyan University, Sonnenblick attended Harvard Medical School. He graduated cum laude in 1958, and began his residency at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York. During his residency, Sonnenblick was credited as the first person to use the electron microscope for imaging the heart muscle under scientifically-controlled conditions when he compared measurements of heart muscle structure and the force of its contractions. With the completion of his residency at Columbia in 1960, he moved to the National Institutes of Health, where he would collaborate with figures like Stanley Sarnoff, Eugene Braunwald, and Henry Spotnitz. During this period, Sonnenblick published his single-author paper, \\"Force-velocity relations in mammalian heart muscle\\" in 1962, which appeared in the American Journal of Physiology. In the paper, he showed that muscle mechanisms account directly for the quantity of blood pumped by the heart. Among other things, this finding provided justification for therapeutic afterload reduction. In 1963, he began investigating heart cell muscle contractions using quantitative electron microscopy. Sonnenblick argued that the positional relationship between filaments within heart muscle cells affects the force of those cells' contractions. Eugene Braunwald later told the New York Times that Sonnenblick's work was akin to \\"what a brilliant mathematician or theoretical physicist does that ultimately allows you to go into space.\\" Sonnenblick left NIH in 1968 and moved to Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. There, he served as Co-director of Cardiology with Richard Gorlin and Co-Director of Cardiovascular Research. He was also Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. In 1975, he relocated to New York City and was appointed the inaugural Director of the Cardiology Division at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He would serve in this capacity until 1996, when he was named Chief Emeritus and the Edmond J. Safra Distinguished University Professor of Medicine. Over the course of his career, Sonnenblick trained more than 300 cardiologists and researchers, authored or co-authored over 600 articles, and made contributions to 16 textbooks on cardiovascular disease. He was also among the founding members of the Heart Failure Society of America. Personal life In 1954, Sonnenblick married Linda Bland, the daughter of Chester Bland, president of Colt's Manufacturing Company between 1955 and 1958. The couple had three daughters.

He served in various senior positions during the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). After the war he lived in France, Mexico and Czechoslovakia. He managed to retain his position as a party executive during the internecine struggles of the long years of exile. Early years Antonio Mije Garc√≠a was born on 24 September 1905 in Seville, to a working-class family. As a child he became an apprentice in a bakery, and in 1919 he joined the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT, National Confederation of Labour) while only 13 years old. At the start of the 1920s he was charged with the treasury of the Baker's union of Seville, and later he became secretary and president of this union. Although self-taught, he directed the union's journal La Aurora, and later the Seville union weekly Voz Proletaria. In 1926 he was admitted to the leadership of the anarcho-syndicalist group attached to the International Red Aid organization. Mije was a militant among the CNT unionists until 1928, when he joined the Internacional Sindical Roja (Profintern). In 1930, after the end of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Mije was elected secretary- general of the CNT Reconstruction Committee. He was very active in the labor disputes in Seville. With the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic he became one of the communist leaders in Seville. In June 1931 he was named assistant union secretary of the regional committee of the Communist Party in Andalusia. He was named secretary general of the Confederaci√≥n General del Trabajo Unitaria (CGTU) in August 1932 and joined the secretariat of the Spanish Communist Party (Partido Comunista Espa√±ol, PCE). In 1932 the Spanish Communist Party made a major change in direction when it abandoned the Comintern slogan \\"Workers' and Peasants' Government\\" and adopted \\"Defense of the Republic\\". Mije was among the new leaders of the party who succeeded Jos√© Bullejos. The others were Jos√© D√≠az, Vicente Uribe, Juan Astigarrab√≠a and Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez Tom√°s. Mije moved to Madrid in 1932. In November 1933 he ran unsuccessfully for deputy of Seville. In the aftermath of the Asturian miners' strike of October 1934 he was forced to obtain false papers to avoid arrest. He became involved in propaganda for the party. In February 1936 he was a Popular Front candidate for Seville, as PCE representative, and was elected as Deputy to the Cortes, where he joined the communist minority. Spain in August 1936 Civil war Spain in November 1938 After the military revolt of July 1936 Mije was at first assigned to represent the PCE in the War Ministry, assigned the rank of colonel. In November 1936, the government evacuated to Valencia. The Political Bureau of the PCE remained in Madrid, unlike the leaders of the other parties. Pedro Checa and Antonio Mije negotiated with General Jos√© Miaja for participation of the Communists in the Madrid Defense Council (Junta de Defensa de Madrid). The communists were given three ministries, War, Supplies and Public Order, which were led by Antonio Mije, Pablo Yag√ºe and Santiago Carrillo, respectively. The Defense Council was restructured and renamed the Junta Delegada de Defensa de Madrid, or the Delegate Defense Council of Madrid, to comply with an order of 25 November 1936 by President Francisco Largo Caballero. This was to affirm that the council was subordinate to the government. Mije was replaced by Isidoro Di√©guez as Militias delegate. In May 1937 Mije was made an inspector of the Army's operations in the South, making his base in √öbeda. From the end of June 1937 Mije again assumed the functions of union secretary on the PCE Central Committee, and was involved in issues of the war economy, mobilization and the production of arms factories. He wrote for the dailies Frente Rojo and Verdad, and directed the PCE organ Mundo Obrero. When the Republican forces were defeated in the Battle of the Ebro (July‚ÄìNovember 1938) and General Francisco Franco's troops reached the Mediterranean, Mije stayed in Madrid with Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez Tom√°s, Pedro Checa, Luis Cabo Giorla and Isidoro Di√©guez Due√±as while the main Communist leadership center was established in Barcelona. Mije participated in the last session of the Cortes in Spain, held in the Castillo de San Fernando in Figueres on 1 February 1939, then escaped to France. Last years Mije spent the following months in Paris. In November 1939 Mije moved to Orl√©ans, and soon after moved to Mexico, where he joined Vicente Uribe and other party leaders. His work in Mexico provoked much criticism from the main CPE leaders who had taken refuge in the Soviet Union, and from the Communist International. Mije managed to steer through the complex internal power struggles in the PCE, which became acute after the secretary-general Jos√© Diaz died in March 1942. The Spanish Communist leader Pedro Checa died in Mexico on 6 August 1942 due to complications from an appendectomy. The guard of honor for his body consisted of Joan Comorera, Antonio Mije, √Ångel √Ålvarez and Federico Melchor. Mije allied himself with Dolores Ib√°rruri, Pasionaria, in opposition to Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez Tom√°s, who was eventually expelled from the party. He remained in Mexico until the start of 1946. He lived in Paris from 1946 to 1950, then moved to Prague, Czechoslovakia for several years. After the PCE meeting in Bucarest in April and May 1956, in which Vicente Uribe was disgraced, Mije kept his membership of the executive. Antonio Mije died in Paris at the start of September 1976 when he was planning to return to Seville, having obtained a passport. His body was flown to Seville, where he was buried in the San Fernando civil cemetery on 11 September 1976, in a ceremony attended by over 3,000 people including several leaders of the Communist Party.

The victim remained unidentified until 2015, when DNA tests confirmed her identity. Cole, native to Kalamazoo, Michigan, had been missing from San Antonio, Texas since 1980. Cole's murder remains unsolved, although the investigation is continuing. Circumstances Cole and her sister Linda \\"Jeanie\\" Phelps lived in Kalamazoo, Michigan, primarily under the care of their grandmother after their mother and father divorced. Later in life, Carol decided to leave Kalamazoo to accompany her mother, Sue, to San Antonio, Texas in 1979 at age 15 but remained in contact with her sister by telephone. Cole was at a girl's home run by the Palmer Drug Abuse Program, also called PDAP, on West 23rd St. in Austin, Texas, from May to October 1980. She continued to call and mail letters to her family, which eventually ceased in late December 1980. A location that Cole had stayed after leaving PDAP was traced by her grandmother in Kalamazoo to a home in Shreveport, Louisiana. Her grandmother called the residence where she was informed that Cole had departed to attend a party but she had never returned. Linda Phelps and her friend Patty Thorington continued to search for her, but were unsuccessful. Cole had been previously excluded as a possible identity of the victim by a medical examiner for unknown reasons. Some sources state that Cole may have spent time at a religious institution known as the New Bethany School for Girls, which was located in Arcadia, Louisiana. Her sister noted that an image taken around the time of Cole's disappearance at the school depicted a group of girls sitting in pews, one of whom bore a strong resemblance to her sister. Investigators have followed such leads. A woman claimed to have spent time with a girl that bore likeness to Cole but was unable to recall her name. Some also believe that the explanation for the names written on the victim's shoes as well as the style of clothing may have been due to a dress code set in place by the New Bethany School for Girls. Discovery On January 28, 1981, a teenage victim's body between fifteen and twenty-one was found concealed by trees in Bellevue, Bossier Parish, Louisiana. She wore jeans, a white, long-sleeved shirt with pink, yellow and blue stripes, a beige sweater with a hood, shoes with the names \\"Michael Brisco\\", \\"David\\", \\"Resha\\", and \\"D. Davies\\", white socks with blue and yellow streaks, white boxer briefs, a white bra and a leather belt with a buckle reading \\"Buffalo Nickel\\", with a buffalo design. None of the names on the clothing amounted to meaningful leads, although they were speculated to have belonged to companions of the Jane Doe. The victim had also painted her fingernails prior to her murder. The shoes were later determined to have been size seven. A knife found in the soil near her remains is thought to have been the murder weapon, as the victim had been stabbed nine times. Most of the evidence recovered from the scene was destroyed due to a fire in 2005 at the facility in which they were stored. Examination and investigation The victim was believed to have been white with possible Native American ancestry and was murdered by sharp force trauma approximately four to seven weeks before her body was located. The remains were in an unrecognizable state of decomposition. She was at a height of around five feet five to five feet six inches tall and weighed between 125 and 140 pounds, placing her at an average build. The victim's hair color was determined to have been \\"blond, straight and shoulder-length\\" and her eye color was unknown due to the state of her body. The girl had orthodontics at one time when alive and may have removed the brackets from her teeth herself or by someone not affiliated with an orthodontic company. It was later confirmed that Cole had broken the braces from her teeth by herself before her disappearance. Investigators had difficulties with establishing the identity of the victim, as there were no means of identification present at the scene and there were no known witnesses. Henry Lee Lucas confessed to her murder, which was not unusual, as he had stated he was responsible for the deaths of other unidentified victims, such as a female nicknamed as Orange Socks (identified in 2019 as Debra Jackson) and the Caledonia Jane Doe (identified a month prior to Cole as Tammy Jo Alexander). Lucas was not considered to be credible, as he was known to be in Florida when Cole was killed and has since been eliminated as a suspect for the murders of Alexander and Jackson. Because of the decomposition of the body, the victim was reconstructed, at first with a three-dimensional clay model and later with a digital method by the Louisiana State University FACES Lab. Once possible, DNA was eventually extracted from the victim's teeth that would be used to compare against missing persons. Identification and later developments Cole's sister, Jeanie Phelps, filed a missing person's report for Carol, although she suspected foul play, after she was unable to locate her and the report was also entered in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, abbreviated as NAMUS. She and Cole's childhood friend had also used Facebook as well as Craigslist to garner awareness and information for the case. The grandmother who was determined to find Cole had since died, but Phelps maintained a strong interest in finding her sister. Meanwhile, on February 6, 2015, the local sheriff department in Bossier Parish started a Facebook page in effort to identify the young woman, calling it \\"Bossier Doe\\". Within days after the creation of the Facebook profile, over five hundred individuals had \\"friended\\" the \\"Bossier Doe\\" account. The number increased to well over one thousand after less than a week. On February 6, a 911 operator named Linda Erickson saw the Facebook page with Bossier Doe's image, then notified detectives when she came across a Craigslist ad with a photo of Carol Ann. It was a Craigslist ad that Patty Thorington, a friend of Carol's sister, had placed in an effort to find any information on the missing girl's whereabouts. By February 13, Thorington said, someone at the Sheriff's Office emailed her regarding their Bossier Doe case. DNA tests were then conducted after officers turned to Cole's family, using the victim's profile against those of her parents. After tests were completed, it was announced that Cole and \\"Bossier Doe\\" were indeed the same person. After this announcement, a GoFundMe account was created for the expenses of a new burial and headstone for the victim, as the family was struggling to pay the means to transport Cole's body and for a headstone. Cole was later buried in the Maple Grove Cemetery in Comstock Township, Michigan on June 18, 2015 after a funeral service. Since Cole's identification, investigation is now aimed at locating the person responsible for her murder. Frances Aucoin, whose father, John Chesson, discovered Cole's remains along with her brother, told officers that she suspects he is responsible for the victim's death. Police confirm that Chesson is considered a person of interest in the case, especially because of his conviction for the murder of his estranged wife's mother, but he has yet to be considered the prime suspect. Aucoin believes that Chesson had decided to go hunting for the first time with his children to establish his innocence by finding the victim's body and reporting it to the police. She went into further detail, describing her father as abusive and that she believes that a young woman he had brought into their home was Cole whom he had picked up as a hitchhiker. Aucoin's brother, a witness in finding the body, committed suicide in 2008. Chesson is currently incarcerated for life for the murder of his estranged wife's mother, which occurred in 1997.

After working at the State Electricity Commission of Victoria as an engineer, Kirby started working for the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB). He became the MMTB's fourth Chairman in 1970, taking over from Robert Risson, and was succeeded by Dudley Snell, the last Chairman of the MMTB, in 1976. Early life Kirby obtained a Bachelor of Electric Engineering from the University of Melbourne in 1936, and commenced work as an engineer at the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board Kirby was the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board's (MMTB) Distribution Engineer from 1953, becoming the MMTB's Chief Engineer in 1960, and rising to Deputy Chairman, under Major- General Sir Robert Risson, in 1965. When Kirby succeeded Risson as Chairman of the MMTB on 1 July 1970, it was in a poor financial situation, with debts exceeding AU$6 million and was losing millions of dollars each year. He attributed this loss partly to the amount of concession tickets the MMTB provided, stating that if not for the concessions the MMTB would have returned a surplus, and seemed \\"anxious to convince other departments to accept financial responsibility for their concession travellers\\". Patronage was also slumping, while the MMTB was facing labour shortages and an ageing rolling stock. Kirby pragmatically said, \\"I'm not a tram man. I'm not a bus man. I'm a transport man\\" in his defence of Melbourne's trams, citing AU$50 million in costs to convert the tram system to bus operation. Kirby also said that \\"Melbourne is geographically suited to trams, and we have 134 route miles of double track, all in excellent condition. We have in the main, wide streets, and there is no doubt at all that as distinct from a railway, the tram as a street public transport system, has the greatest capacity to move people quickly.\\" Kirby also advocated for the under-grounding of some tram lines for operational savings, and supported a 1974 proposal to reintroduce trams to Sydney. Following Henry Bolte's resignation in 1972 as Premier of Victoria, Rupert Hamer become Premier and there was a tempering of Victoria's car- dominated transport planning, with some new investment in public transport. This was in part due to a social backlash against Melbourne's freeway plans. Kirby welcomed this change, commenting in 1974 that \\"we have got to get top- grade public transport. In Melbourne we have the makings of the best public transport system in Australia and perhaps one of the best in the world. But lack of finance has caused it to run down.\\" Kirby lobbied the Hamer Government to order trams, and succeeded, with PCC 1041 (a prototype inspired from a 1965 European fact-finding mission Kirby had been on) entering service (but failing upon launch due to poor electrical equipment, which had been reused from an older prototype PCC 980) in April 1973. Contracts for the Z-class tram, based on PCC 1041, were awarded to Comeng in 1973 with the first Z-class tram entering service in 1975. Kirby's six-year tenure was the shortest of any MMTB Chairman, and is not looked upon favourably. MMTB debts soared, with financial responsibility, through subsidies, falling on the State Government. This also transferred much decision making power, including the ordering of new trams and buses, out of the hands of the MMTB and into the Government. Dudley Snell, who had been Deputy Chairman of the MMTB under Kirby, succeeded Kirby as Chairman on 16 July 1976.

He sang this duet song with his female co-singer Krishna Patel. He has sung over 1000 songs and regarded as a top exponent of Sambalpuri language song . He has shared the stage with other leading artists of the State including the former Chief Minister Giridhar Gamang, himself a fine musician. He received the Padma Shri,the fourth highest civilian award of India from the Government of India in 2017 for his contribution to the Indian Music. Personal life Haripal dropped out of school and has never taken formal training for songs. He has borrowed this skill from his father Mandhata Haripal, who was a talented musician himself. Being very poor, he could not afford a teacher. His family was landless. They have the only property as singing. In an interview to The Hindu he says, \\"I know the raagas but not their titles, It is only when people tell me that the song you have sung is in this or that raaga that I get to know the names\\". Professional life According to him, \\"Music is not safe source of earning\\". Hence he has worked as a construction labourer and did other odd jobs some time. He started his career as a singer in All India Radio (AIR) in 1971 and worked as a \\"Senior B High\\" grade as an artist. In the 70s he became popular because of Rangabati Song. After being a hit number on AIR, in 1976 the song got recorded again in Kolkata by a music company, INDRECO. A dispute over authorship of the tune stopped the release of the disc. Finally he won in the legal battle in courts and the disc was released in 1978‚Äì79. After this another bad thing happened. Due to huge popularity of the song, the cassette company signed him for 3 years, with the option of a two-year extension. Thereafter the company went into a lockout, then closed and ownership transferred. Due to contract, he could not perform for anybody else and his royalties stopped. He got only around Rs. 10,000. Although he rose to fame because of the Rangabati Song, which was in pure Sambalpuri dialect, he has not restricted himself to Sambalpuri folk music only. He used to listen folk music from everywhere. He is a versatile musician who understands and sings folk songs of various dialect such as Sambalpuri (Kosli Language, Bhojpuri, Odia, Chhattisgarhi and Dhakia Bengali music. Interesting Incident \\"A crowd recognised him at Batapur railway station. It refused to let the train move until Haripal sang Rangabati Song. Finally, the train driver asked him to sing a few lines so that the train can move!\\" Family His youngest son Prabhat is a well-known percussionist and his daughter-in-law Minu is a popular singer. His granddaughter Ghungroo loves folk dances. Even after being in lime light, in 2001, his family was not in good financial condition. Their family troupe used to make little money. They lost all their instruments in heavy rain and used to hire or borrow. Contribution for upliftment of Sambalpuri folk music In April 2015, Haripal submitted a petition to secretary, tourism and culture, Aurobinda Padhi seeking his intervention to ensure that folk songs retain their original glory. He does not like the obscene and vulgar lyrics in Sambalpuri folk songs now-a-days and wants to censor the video albums.

History   First conference  The first conference held in November 2011 in London. There, a set of principles ‚Äúfor governing behavior in cyberspace‚Äù have been established after a discussion from 700 participants.  Second conference  The second conference held on October 4-5th, 2012 in Budapest. The main subject and focus that has been discussed was the relationship between internet rights and internet security. Even though very few civil society organisations were invited to speak, the networking was valuable, and had more longer term impact than the Chair‚Äôs statement which represents the outcome of the event.  Third conference  The third event held on 17‚Äì18 October 2013 in Seoul. The conference had grown to approximately 1,600 attendees with greater representation from countries in the global South. Arguably the most significant outcome of the London Process is the Seoul Framework for and Commitment to Open and Secure Cyberspace, which highlights the importance of universal internet access, emphasizes that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, and echoes a UN report that established that international law is applicable online and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment.  Fourth conference  The fourth GCCS conference held at the World Forum from 16 to 17 April 2015 in The Hague.

Goldsmith Pickett was in business as a goldsmith on Ludgate Hill from 1758, initially a partner in Thead & Pickett. From 1768 to 1777 he traded under his own name. From 1777 Philip Rundell was a partner with him in Pickett & Rundell.In December 1781 his daughter died of burns after her clothes caught fire the previous evening. Pickett had been in the same room, but was unable to react quickly enough. In 1786 Rundell bought out Pickett, and within about a year the firm became Rundell and Bridge, the dominant London goldsmiths for half a century. Politician Pickett was elected alderman of Cornhill Ward in 1783. In London's Court of Alderman he belonged to the Whig group, opposed to the government of William Pitt the younger in the 1790s. In 1787, at the request of local traders, he campaigned for the removal of Temple Bar, but without success. While this scheme for street widening was thrown out, Pickett did succeed with another, near the Strand in the area of St Clement Danes.

As an undergraduate student at Richmond Professional Institute (RPI), Bumgardner was encouraged by his mentor Jewett Campbell to study with the notable Art Students League of New York instructor Hans Hoffman (1880‚Äì1966), and Bumgardner received the last scholarship given by Hoffman, a German-born American abstract expressionist painter. Using his scholarship, Bumgardner studied with Hoffman in Provincetown in 1957, during which time he became friends with gallery director Richard Bellamy and artist Jan M√ºller. In 1963 in Richmond Jim Bumgardner and Jon Bowie co-directed a series of multi-media events or \\"happenings\\". The first was called \\"Synthesis\\" and was influenced by the productions of Allan Kaprow and the ONCE Festival of New Music of Ann Arbor, Michigan. After \\"Synthesis\\" Bumgardner and Jon Bowie invited notable outside performance and visual artists who joined in a series of annual \\"Bang, Bang, Bang Arts Festival\\" happenings in Richmond.  Education and teaching career  As a youth, James Arliss Bumgardner studied painting at St. Leo's Catholic Church in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, with Sister St. Denys, who had been a restorer at the Vatican Museums. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for one year before deciding to focus on a career in art. Another year of art study was spent at Salem College under the instruction of Ed Shewmake, and in 1965 the college added art by Bumgardner to its collection. In 1955 he switched to Richmond Professional Institute in Richmond, Virginia (afterward renamed Virginia Commonwealth University), where he studied with Jewett Campbell and received his BFA before beginning his teaching career. While studying with Hoffman he befriended gallery director Richard Bellamy and artist Jan M√ºller, and was influenced by them. In 1957 Jim Bumgardner was hired to paint the historic childhood home of the arctic explorer Donald Baxter MacMillan, and his friend Dick Bellamy agreed to help him. Art historian Judith Stein relates in her account \\"Provincetown, 1954, 2011\\", that \\"Neither had experience with the tricky business of unfurling rolls, matching patterns and anchoring strips to the wall with glue.

When RPI became VCU, Bumgardner became a member of the Painting and Printmaking faculty in Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts. One of Bumgardner's students was Richmond artist/musician/actor Wes Freed, who attended Virginia Commonwealth University, where he was strongly influenced by professors James Bumgardner and Myron Helfgott. At VCU, Freed, known for his association with the Athens-via-Alabama rock band, Drive- By Truckers, also studied with Lester Van Winkle, Joseph H. Seipel and James Bradford. Bumgardner was one of the artists who lost a large studio space in Richmond's old Masonic Temple after being displaced a decade previously from another closed studio complex. As described by Richmond Magazine's art historian Harry Kollatz, \\"a group of artists came to the temple‚Äôs doors after leaving studios in Shockoe Slip‚Äôs Bowers Brothers Coffee building because of its reclamation by developer Andrew J. Asch Jr. This group included VCU professors Morris Yarowsky, Jim Bumgardner, Jos√© Puig, Sal Federico and Myron Helfgott, along with graduates Jeff Davis and Bruce Behrman. On Nov. 15, 1973, during preparations for the move-in, Puig, a sculptor, jimmied open an elevator shaft and fell one story to his death. This almost halted the temple migration. But the artists needed a place to work, and for a decade, securing a studio at the temple became a rite of artistic passage.\\"  Exhibitions  As a young artist in the 1957 North Carolina Artists Show, Bumgardner was awarded a purchase prize and a scholarship.http://www.richmond.com/.../article_91b407fd-7b7a-595b-ac9f-514b3ff02ebb.h...

BANG focused on RPI alumni, faculty, and their creative associates, some affiliated with the university and many who were not. Alexandra Klingelhut of the VCU University Public Affairs office described the poster used for one of the shows, announcing, \\"A poster of six artists with ties to RPI who participated in a multi-media performance during the Bang, Bang, Bang Arts Festival in 1966. The festival was a week-long celebration of experimental art held each spring at RPI from 1964 to 1967.\\" Artists in the 1966 exhibition shown at the Richmond Public Library were James Bumgardner, Jonathan Bowie, Richard Carlyon, Bernard Martin, and Willard Pilchard. Experimental BANG festivals I, II, III, and IV, starting in 1964 are discussed on the website of Richmond Professional Institute art alumna Carol Sutton. The Sutton website also shows some of the imaginative BANG posters and recalls details about the celebrity participants who attended. Artists, performers, and fans for BANG included one-man band blues singer Jesse Fuller, composers Robert Ashley and John Cage, filmmaker George Manupelli, dancer Twyla Tharp, painters Barnett Newman and Larry Rivers, experimental printmaker Robert Rauschenberg, critic Henry Geldzahler, jazz musician John Lee Hooker, sculptor George Segal, gallery director Richard Bellamy, and a writer from Village Voice, Howard Smith. In 1975, his art was exhibited in a one-person exhibition at the 20th Century Gallery in Williamsburg, Virginia. In 1978 Bumgardner exhibited his recent works at Scott McKennis Gallery in Richmond. In September 26 - October 22, 1978, simultaneously with the Scott-Mckennis show, his art, mostly on loan from private collections, was exhibited in a one-man show at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and a Certificate of Distinction in the VMFA's previous juried biennial exhibition.Proctor, Roy.

These usually emulate an existing architecture, and are built with the purpose of either providing a platform to run programs where the real hardware is not available for use (for example, executing on otherwise obsolete platforms), or of having multiple instances of virtual machines leading to more efficient use of computing resources, both in terms of energy consumption and cost effectiveness (known as hardware virtualization, the key to a cloud computing environment), or both. A VM was originally defined by Popek and Goldberg as \\"an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real machine\\". System virtual machines System virtual machine advantages: * Multiple OS environments can co-exist on the same primary hard drive, with a virtual partition that allows sharing of files generated in either the \\"host\\" operating system or \\"guest\\" virtual environment. Adjunct software installations, wireless connectivity, and remote replication, such as printing and faxing, can be generated in any of the guest or host operating systems. Regardless of the system, all files are stored on the hard drive of the host OS. * Application provisioning, maintenance, high availability and disaster recovery are inherent in the virtual machine software selected. * Can provide emulated hardware environments different from the host's instruction set architecture (ISA), through emulation or by using just-in-time compilation. The main disadvantages of VMs are: * A virtual machine is less efficient than an actual machine when it accesses the host hard drive indirectly. * When multiple VMs are concurrently running on the hard drive of the actual host, adjunct virtual machines may exhibit a varying and/or unstable performance (speed of execution and malware protection). This depends on the data load imposed on the system by other VMs, unless the selected VM software provides temporal isolation among virtual machines. * Malware protections for VMs are not necessarily compatible with the \\"host\\", and may require separate software. Multiple VMs running their own guest operating system are frequently engaged for server consolidation in order to avoid interference from separate VMs on the same actual machine platform. The desire to run multiple operating systems was the initial motivation for virtual machines, so as to allow time-sharing among several single-tasking operating systems. In some respects, a system virtual machine can be considered a generalization of the concept of virtual memory that historically preceded it. IBM's CP/CMS, the first systems to allow full virtualization, implemented time sharing by providing each user with a single-user operating system, the CMS. Unlike virtual memory, a system virtual machine entitled the user to write privileged instructions in their code. This approach had certain advantages, such as adding input/output devices not allowed by the standard system.Smith and Nair, pp. 395‚Äì396 As technology evolves virtual memory for purposes of virtualization, new systems of memory overcommitment may be applied to manage memory sharing among multiple virtual machines on one actual computer operating system. It may be possible to share \\"memory pages\\" that have identical contents among multiple virtual machines that run on the same physical machine, what may result in mapping them to the same physical page by a technique known as Kernel SamePage Merging. This is particularly useful for read-only pages, such as those that contain code segments; in particular, that would be the case for multiple virtual machines running the same or similar software, software libraries, web servers, middleware components, etc. The guest operating systems do not need to be compliant with the host hardware, thereby making it possible to run different operating systems on the same computer (e.g., Microsoft Windows, Linux, or previous versions of an operating system) to support future software. The use of virtual machines to support separate guest operating systems is popular in regard to embedded systems. A typical use would be to run a real-time operating system simultaneously with a preferred complex operating system, such as Linux or Windows. Another use would be for novel and unproven software still in the developmental stage, so it runs inside a sandbox. Virtual machines have other advantages for operating system development, and may include improved debugging access and faster reboots.Super Fast Server Reboots ‚Äì Another reason Virtualization rocks . vmwarez.com (2006-05-09). Retrieved on 2013-06-14. Techniques Different virtualization techniques are used, based on the desired usage. Native execution is based on direct virtualization of the underlying raw hardware, thus it provides multiple \\"instances\\" of the same architecture a real machine is based on, capable of running complete operating systems. Some virtual machines can also emulate different architectures and allow execution of software applications and operating systems written for another CPU or architecture. Operating-system-level virtualization allows the resources of a computer to be partitioned via kernel's support for multiple isolated user space instances, which are usually called containers and may look and feel like real machines to the end users. Some computer architectures are capable of hardware-assisted virtualization, which enables efficient full virtualization by using virtualization-specific hardware capabilities, primarily from the host CPUs. Virtualization of the underlying raw hardware (native execution)  This approach is described as full virtualization of the hardware, and can be implemented using a type 1 or type 2 hypervisor: a type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the hardware, and a type 2 hypervisor runs on another operating system, such as Linux or Windows. Each virtual machine can run any operating system supported by the underlying hardware. Users can thus run two or more different \\"guest\\" operating systems simultaneously, in separate \\"private\\" virtual computers. The pioneer system using this concept was IBM's CP-40, the first (1967) version of IBM's CP/CMS (1967‚Äì1972) and the precursor to IBM's VM family (1972‚Äìpresent). With the VM architecture, most users run a relatively simple interactive computing single-user operating system, CMS, as a \\"guest\\" on top of the VM control program (VM-CP). This approach kept the CMS design simple, as if it were running alone; the control program quietly provides multitasking and resource management services \\"behind the scenes\\". In addition to CMS communication and other system tasks are performed by multitasking VMs (RSCS, GCS, TCP/IP, UNIX), and users can run any of the other IBM operating systems, such as MVS, even a new CP itself or now z/OS. Even the simple CMS could be run in a threaded environment (LISTSERV, TRICKLE). z/VM is the current version of VM, and is used to support hundreds or thousands of virtual machines on a given mainframe. Some installations use Linux on IBM Z to run Web servers, where Linux runs as the operating system within many virtual machines. Full virtualization is particularly helpful in operating system development, when experimental new code can be run at the same time as older, more stable, versions, each in a separate virtual machine. The process can even be recursive: IBM debugged new versions of its virtual machine operating system, VM, in a virtual machine running under an older version of VM, and even used this technique to simulate new hardware.See History of CP/CMS for IBM's use of virtual machines for operating system development and simulation of new hardware The standard x86 instruction set architecture as used in the modern PCs does not actually meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements. Notably, there is no execution mode where all sensitive machine instructions always trap, which would allow per- instruction virtualization. Despite these limitations, several software packages have managed to provide virtualization on the x86 architecture, even though dynamic recompilation of privileged code, as first implemented by VMware, incurs some performance overhead as compared to a VM running on a natively virtualizable architecture such as the IBM System/370 or Motorola MC68020. By now, several other software packages such as Virtual PC, VirtualBox, Parallels Workstation and Virtual Iron manage to implement virtualization on x86 hardware. Intel and AMD have introduced features to their x86 processors to enable virtualization in hardware. As well as virtualization of the resources of a single machine, multiple independent nodes in a cluster can be combined and accessed as a single virtual NUMA machine.Matthew Chapman and Gernot Heiser. vNUMA: A virtual shared-memory multiprocessor. Proceedings of the 2009 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, San Diego, CA, USA, June, 2009 Emulation of a non-native system Virtual machines can also perform the role of an emulator, allowing software applications and operating systems written for another computer processor architecture to be run. Operating-system-level virtualization Operating- system-level virtualization is a server virtualization technology which virtualizes servers on an operating system (kernel) layer. It can be thought of as partitioning: a single physical server is sliced into multiple small partitions (otherwise called virtual environments (VE), virtual private servers (VPS), guests, zones, etc.); each such partition looks and feels like a real server, from the point of view of its users. For example, Solaris Zones supports multiple guest operating systems running under the same operating system such as Solaris 10. Guest operating systems can use the same kernel level with the same operating system version, or can be a separate copy of the operating system with a different kernel version using Solaris Kernel Zones. Solaris native Zones also requires that the host operating system is a version of Solaris; other operating systems from other manufacturers are not supported. However, Solaris Branded Zones would need to be used to have other operating systems as zones. Another example is System Workload Partitions (WPARs), introduced in version 6.1 of the IBM AIX operating system. System WPARs are software partitions running under one instance of the global AIX OS environment. The operating system level architecture has low overhead that helps to maximize efficient use of server resources. The virtualization introduces only a negligible overhead and allows running hundreds of virtual private servers on a single physical server. In contrast, approaches such as full virtualization (like VMware) and paravirtualization (like Xen or UML) cannot achieve such level of density, due to overhead of running multiple kernels. From the other side, operating system-level virtualization does not allow running different operating systems (i.e., different kernels), although different libraries, distributions, etc. are possible. Different virtualization techniques are used, based on the desired usage. Native execution is based on direct virtualization of the underlying raw hardware, thus it provides multiple \\"instances\\" of the same architecture a real machine is based on, capable of running complete operating systems. Some virtual machines can also emulate different architectures and allow execution of software applications and operating systems written for another CPU or architecture.

In cooperation with √âmile-Coriolan Guillemin, Barye did the artwork for \\"The Arab Warrior Knight on Horseback\\". Included in Barye's oeuvre were animalier bronzes as well as Oriental subjects. At his father's request, he signed his work as \\"fils\\" to differentiate his work from his father's. Early life Alfred Barye was born in Paris, France, on 21 January 1839, the son of Antoine-Louis Barye. He learned his craft of animalier sculptor under the watchful eye of his father who was one of the original pioneers of animal sculpture in the mid-to-late 19th century. The younger Barye didn't always get along with his father; there were times when the two of them were not on speaking terms because until instructed not to do so, Barye was signing some of his bronzes as \\"A. Barye\\" which the senior Barye objected to because it created confusion as to which Barye, father or son, created the sculpture. Career silvered bronze sculpture of a pheasant by Barye () He specialized in the animalier school in the production of bronze sculptures. Although a fine artist in his own right, he struggled to create his own identity living in the shadow of his more famous father. The vast majority of his pieces are signed \\"A. Barye, fils\\" while some are marked \\"Barye\\" or \\"A. Barye\\" which created some confusion ‚Äì intentional or not ‚Äì with those of his father. The majority of the sculptures leaving the Barye foundry were sand castings rather than lost-wax castings. Alfred typically used mid- brown patinas but would sometimes add green (a color famously used by his father) and auburn-colored hues in the patination process. Any Barye bronze ‚Äì by father or son ‚Äì will generally have an exquisite patina. Antoine-Louis was particularly finicky with his patinas and would not allow other foundries to apply them, preferring to do it himself for appearance and quality control purposes. Alfred, too, would not let a sculpture leave his workshop without a perfectly applied and visually pleasing patina. Alfred Barye did a production of bronze sculptures and focused his attention on race horses or horses on the move. Some of his well-known bronzes are The Arab Warrior Knight on Horseback (1890‚Äì1910, made in Paris, height 87 cm, width 61 cm, depth 30 cm, bronze). Death and legacy Barye died in Paris in 1882. He is known for the precision detail in his bronze sculptures, as shown in the pheasant sculpture (pictured right). Barye was known for great attention to detail on his bronzes. He produced a number of bird sculptures as well as genre figures. He received \\"honourable mention\\" honors in the 1897 Salon for the work Aide Fauconnier Indien, Retour de Chasse √† la Gazelle. Alfred Barye's final submission at the Salon de Louvre was in 1882.

Hewitt was a coal-powered fireboat operated by the Fire Department of New York City from 1903 to 1958. She was the department's last coal-powered vessel and had a pumping capacity of 7,000 gallons per minute. She was launched on July 11, 1903, at the shipyards of the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey. She was commissioned in October 1903, and was named after recently deceased former mayor Abram Hewitt. Operational history According to some accounts, she was the first fireboat called to the 1904 burning of the General Slocum, where over a thousand people lost their lives. Other accounts say the Zophar Mills was the first fireboat to be dispatched. On August 14, 1913, a fire was discovered at a large oil storage yard, on what was then Long Island City, and the Abram S. Hewitt was sent to try to put it out. While extinguishing the fire her \\"bow gun\\", her frontmost water cannon, burst from her footings, flying into the air, and striking Bertram Johnson, the firefighter assigned to it. He was declared dead, at the scene. On January 28, 1927, the Abram S. Hewitts captain, John Connoly, was jolted into the Hudson River by a collision. Although he was burdened by heavy fire equipment he was able to swim to a barge, where he clung to a boathook lowered to him by a crew member. It took the Abram S. Hewitt half an hour to return and rescue him, because it was damaged by the collision. On April 29, 1930, the Abram S. Hewitt responded when Cornelius Vanderbilt III's luxurious yacht, the Winchester, was set ablaze following a boiler explosion. The Abram S. Hewitt was called to assist other fireboats when a large fire burst out of control a second time. The fire burst out at pier 4. Barrels of flammable liquids had destroyed the pier, and two neighboring piers, but firefighters thought the blaze had been brought under control. However, when it burst out again the Abram S. Hewitt was better suited to navigate through debris, close to the fire. The Abram S. Hewitt was eventually taken to the Staten Island boat graveyard.

Bred in Kentucky by her owner Stavros Niarchos she was sent to race in England where she was trained by Henry Cecil. She was one of the best juvenile fillies of her generation in Europe, winning four of her five races including the Cherry Hinton Stakes in Britain and the Moyglare Stud Stakes in Ireland. In the following year she did not contest any of the classics but recorded major victories in the Coronation Stakes and the Child Stakes. After being retired at the end of the season she became a highly successful broodmare, producing several major winners. Background Chimes of Freedom was a chestnut mare with a small white star and a white sock on her right front foot bred in Kentucky by Flaxman Holdings, the breeding company of her owner Stavros Niarchos. She was trained throughout her racing career by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in all of her races by Steve Cauthen. She was sired by Private Account a top-class performer on dirt in the United States who won the Gulfstream Park Handicap and the Widener Handicap in 1980. He later became a very successful breeding stallion who showed a particular aptitude for siring racemares: the best of his offspring included Personal Ensign, East of the Moon and Inside Information. Chimes of Freedom's dam Aviance won the Phoenix Stakes for Robert Sangster in 1984 and was later sold privately to Niarchos. Aviance produced several other winners including Denon (Hollywood Derby, Charles Whittingham Memorial Handicap, Turf Classic, Manhattan Handicap), and Imperfect Circle (dam of Spinning World). Aviance was a granddaughter of the influential broodmare Best In Show, whose other descendants included El Gran Senor, Try My Best, Xaar, Jazil, Rags to Riches and Redoute's Choice. Racing career 1989: two-year-old season Chimes of Freedom began her racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Lingfield Park Racecourse on 27 May. She started 4/11 favourite against seven opponents and won easily by six lengths. Nineteen days later she beat two rivals in the Kingsclere Stakes over the same distance at Newbury Racecourse at odds of 1/4. On 11 July the filly was stepped up in class for the Group Three Cherry Hinton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and started 4/9 favourite in an eight-runner field. Her challengers included Dead Certain and Please Believe Me who had finished first and second in the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot. After chasing the leaders she finished strongly but it was only in the final stride that she caught Dead Certain (who was carrying a five-pound weight penalty for her Ascot victory) to win by a short head. In September Chimes of Freedom was sent to Ireland for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh and started second favourite behind Pharaoh's Delight, a British-trained filly who had won the Princess Margaret Stakes and the Phoenix Stakes. Chimes of Freedom produced her best performance up to that time, moving up alongside Pharaoh's Delight two furlongs out before drawing away to win by six lengths. On her final appearance of the season, Chimes of Freedom started favourite for Britain's most prestigious race for juvenile fillies, the Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket. In a blanket finish in which the first five finishers were separated by one and a half lengths, she finished third of the eleven runners behind Dead Certain and Line of Thunder. 1990: three-year-old season On her first appearance as a three-year-old Chimes of Freedom started second favourite behind Dead Certain in the Fred Darling Stakes (a trial for the 1000 Guineas) at Newbury. Although Dead Certain ran poorly and finished tailed-off, Chimes of Freedom never looked likely to win and finished fourth of the eight runners behind Salsabil, Haunting Beauty and London Pride. After a break of two months, Chimes of Freedom was one of seven fillies to contest the 141st renewal of the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and was made the 11/2 fourth choice in the betting. The favourite was Heart of Joy who had won the Nell Gwyn Stakes before finishing second in both the 1000 Guineas and the Irish 1000 Guineas whilst the other contenders included Pharaoh's Delight and the highly regarded Harry Thomson Jones-trained Hasbah. The filly was restrained by Cauthen in the early stages and turned into the straight in fourth place behind Hasbah, Water Well and Heart of Joy. She moved forward in the straight to take the lead a furlong out and accelerated clear of the field to win \\"easily\\" by five lengths from Hasbah, with Heart of oy a length and a half away in third place. On 11 July Chimes of Freedom started 4/6 for the Group Two Child Stakes (now the Group One Falmouth Stakes) at Newmarket for which her rivals included Hasbah and the four-year-old Aldbourne. After being held up by Cauthen, she took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away to win by two and a half lengths from the Dick Hern-trained Arousal with Hasbah in third. A month after her win at Newmarket, Chimes of Freedom was sent to France and was matched against colts and older horses in the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville. She was amongst the leaders until the last 400 metres but then weakened and finished seventh of the ten runners behind Priolo. Breeding record Chimes of Freedom was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Flaxman Holdings in Kentucky. She produced at least eleven foals and six winners between 1993 and 2008: *Wind of Roses, a chestnut filly, foaled in 1993, sired by Lomond. Unraced. *Tomisue's Indy, chestnut filly, 1994, by A.P.

Ray Avery  Differences from the book  In the original text, Tower of Ivory (1910) by Gertrude Atherton, Margaret Hill and John Ordham would meet on a boat and fall in love. However, they become separated due to a shipwreck, and would reunite 5 years later by accident at Hill‚Äôs concert. Ordham would then approach Hill and ask for her hand in marriage. This is different from the film, in which Ordham would rescue Hill from the shipwreck, and that event would be the one that sparked their romantic relationship. The director likely made this change to decrease run-time and add a suspenseful sea rescue scene, which proved to be the right idea since that scene in particular was praised by critics.  Critical Response  Out of the Storm (1920) received generally negative feedback from the audience. As the fourth movie out of eleven adapted from a novel, original text‚Äôs author Gertrude Atherton is certainly no stranger to adaptations onto the big screen. The plot was praised for its ability to ‚Äúhold one‚Äôs interest by reason of its melodramatic moments, which are punctuated by other scenes that lack reality‚Äù, but the largest disappointment was certainly the performance that lead actress Castleton failed to deliver. Critics from the Exhibitors Herald described Castleton‚Äôs acting as ‚Äúunnatural and stilting‚Äù, and was the ‚Äúmost unnatural and unempathetic of the entire cast.‚Äù They further stated that she ‚Äúplays it with too much restraint‚Äù. This left audiences unsatisfied, considering castleton having ‚Äúa very good account of herself‚Äù in other films. One redeeming factor from critics were that the shipwreck scene was ‚Äúone of the best shipwreck scenes‚Äù to be produced at that time. References Bibliography * Goble, Alan.

The Weblings take poison and die before the detectives can prevent it. Mamsie obtains employment in a ship builder's office under Davidge. The secret launching of a ship is innocently disclosed by Mamsie to her brother-in-law, a confessed member of the Industrial Workers of the World, who in turn advises a German spy. The ship is destroyed off Cape Charles by a German U-boat. Mamsie then proposes to run down the criminals and, while employed as a \\"passer boy,\\" unearths a scheme to blow up the dockyards.

History United States In 1953 a team led by Hermann Klemm started developing a new model for Ferguson, known as the TO35, to replace the TO30.Michael Thorne (2014) Massey Ferguson 35 & 65 Models in Detail, Herridge & Sons, p19 Klemm wrote to Harry Ferguson in July that year to tell him about the features of the TO35. Ferguson was unhappy with the project, and ordered Klemm to stop work. However, after another letter from Klemm, running to 23 pages, Ferguson changed his mind and allowed development to continue. Although Ferguson had merged with Massey-Harris to form Massey Ferguson in 1953, the TO35 was marketed under the Ferguson name. The new Ferguson 35 was launched in the United States on 5 January 1955, a year earlier than planned, following a decision made at a conference in San Antonio in March 1954.Thorne, p22 It was initially available in two models; standard or deluxe, with a third (utility) added in 1956. Despite not being designed for industrial use, it became popular amongst industry users. The colour scheme was changed from all-grey to a beige shell and wheels and a grey body in May 1956.Thorne, p21 In December 1957 the scheme changed again when the TO35 was rebranded in the standard Massey Ferguson red and grey. However, the wording on the tractor continued to be \\"Ferguson\\" until February 1960. Production ended in late 1964. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the MF35 was launched on 1 October 1956 at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London,Thorne, p52 and was originally marketed as the Ferguson 35 (FE35). Built at Massey Ferguson's Banner Lane factory in Coventry, the first FE35 (serial number 1001) had been produced on 27 August that year.Thorne, p133 The FE35 was a successor to the Ferguson TE20, which ceased production in the same year. Whilst the TE20 had been an all-grey tractor (earning it the nickname Little Grey Fergie), the FE35 had a grey shell and wheels, but a bronze finish for the body,Thorne, p42 leading to it becoming known as the \\"Gold Belly\\".Innishannon Steam and Vintage Rally 2012 celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Massey Ferguson 35x Innishannon Steam and Vintage RallyInnishannon steams past ‚Ç¨million mark Southern Star Three types were built; agricultural, industrial and vineyard,Thorne, p34 although only a small number of the latter were produced.Thorne, p44 The industrial model was designed for compliance with the Road Traffic Act 1947, including a driving mirror and a high-frequency horn.Thorne, p46 In 1957, after 73,655 units had been produced, the tractor was rebadged as the MF35, and the colour scheme was changed to red and grey.Thorne, p48 In 1959 Massey Ferguson purchased Perkins Engines, and began using a new diesel Perkins engine in the MF35. De Luxe models had a dual clutch, allowing the user to disengage the rear wheels while keeping the power take-off and hydraulic pump engaged.Massey Ferguson 35 Vintage Tractor Engineer On 8 November 1962 the company launched the MF35X, which had an increased power output and the additional \\"multi-power\\" system, which allowed the driver to shift up or down a gear ratio without using the clutch.Thorne, pp51‚Äì56 Although production in England reached over 45,000 units the following year, it ceased in 1964, when it was succeeded by the Massey Ferguson 135. Over its eight-year production run, 388,382 units were produced.Thorne, p60 Many are still used today on small farms.Thorne, p130 The Banner Lane factory continued to supply kits to foreign manufacturers until 24 December 2002.

Plot In 1923, on the eve of the high school graduation, a pair of teenage girls, Cornelia Otis Skinner (Gail Russell) and Emily Kimbrough (Diana Lynn) are crestfallen when Emily contracts measles and cannot attend the dance. Cornelia, daughter of famous actor Otis Skinner (Charlie Ruggles), also bemoans the fact that \\"heartthrob,\\" Avery Moore (James Brown), ignores her, and is about to leave on a European trip. Emily suggests they both go to Europe, and without a chaperone. On the same boat as Avery, Cornelia accepts a date from him to go to a dance on the ship, while Emily meets Tom Newhall (Bill Edwards), a handsome young doctor and bachelor. Their romantic intentions go awry when Cornelia comes down with measles, and Tom agrees to use makeup to mask the spots, but she does not want to tell Avery about her infection. When the ship reaches London, Cornelia's parents, who had traveled on another cruise ship, meet the two girls. At a tour of Hampton Court Palace in Paris, Cornelia spots Avery and the two young people reunite, but after kissing her, Avery comes down with measles. Cornelia and Emily head off for Paris to sight see on their own. After getting trapped on a balcony at Notre Dame Cathedral, the girls drop articles of clothing to try to get the attention of passersby, to no avail. When Cornelia and Emily finally return to their hotel in their slips, they encounter Mr. Skinner's friend, actor Monsieur Darnet (Georges Renavent), and his friend, Pierre Cambouille (Roland Varno). To help them, the gentlemen escort them inside, but Avery thinks the worst and hits Cambouille. A brawl erupts just as Mr. and Mrs. Skinner arrive from England, and Mr. Skinner insists that it is time for his daughter to return home.

In casting, a number of actors were considered including Katharine Hepburn to play Cornelia, with Jane Withers and Mimi Chandler also tested for roles in the film. Reception Film critic Armond White (A.W.) in reviewing Our Hearts Were Young and Gay for The New York Times said, \\"Obviously not designed to deliver a message, Our Hearts Were Young and Gay, Paramount's film version of the Cornelia Otis Skinner-Emily Kimbrough book of remembrances of hectic things past, lives up to its title. Blithely recalling the trip abroad made by those ladies when they were in their impressionable 'teens, its story is as light as a marshmallow and sometimes as cloyingly sweet. Although the picture's foreword coyly denies that it is intended as a period piece, it very often uses the devices of dated clothes and manners to garner laughs. If the film occasionally stumbles on its merry way, blame it on those arid humorless stretches when Our Hearts Were Young and Gay becomes more young than gay. Generally, however, the producers have fused the effervescence of youth with rosy-tinted nostalgia to make an amusing and satisfying entertainment.\\"White, Armond (A.W.). \\"Movie review: 'Our Hearts Were Young and Gay' at the Paramount.\\" The New York Times, December 10, 1944.

It has been since covered by many artists. It was featured in the 2013 video game The Last Of Us, appearing during the cutscene titled bil-hun-transition. Background The recording of \\"Alone and Forsaken\\" by Williams was taken from a performance on Shreveport radio from KWKH studio between August 1948 and May 1949\\" MGM released it in 1955, over two years after Williams' death. The singer accompanies himself alone on an acoustic guitar. The song explores the themes of loneliness and desolation, which Williams had written about on previous ballads like \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" and \\"May You Never Be Alone,\\" but this song, set in A minor and featuring only Hank's guitar and voice, has a stark quality that is darkly affecting. It is one of the few songs that Williams ever wrote and sang that sounds more like a folk song than a country song. In the half spoken verses, the narrator reflects upon meeting his love, when \\"the pastures were green and the meadows were gold,\\" but \\"her love, like the leaves, now have withered and gone.\\" The darkening imagery gives way to a desperate plea on the chorus: ::\\"Alone and forsaken by fate and by man ::Oh Lord, if you hear me, please hold to my hand, oh please understand.\\" Cover versions *The first issued version of the song was by Bill Darnell, who recorded it on January 16, 1952. *Pianist Floyd Cramer recorded an instrumental version in 1962 on RCA. *Chet Atkins (who played guitar on several of Williams' recordings) recorded it for his 1965 album More of That Guitar Country. *A previously unissued version by Hank Williams, Jr. recorded in 1974 appears on the 1992 box set Living Proof: The MGM Recordings 1963-1975. *Tony Rice recorded it on his 1975 LP California Autumn. *British rock band the Mekons issued the song as the B-side to their 1986 single \\"Hello Cruel World.\\" *Townes Van Zandt performs the song on the 1996 album In Pain. *Neko Case included a version on her 2001 EP Canadian Amp. *The album is featured on the 2001 tribute album Timeless: Hank Williams Tribute as a duet by Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris. *The song appears on the 2011 Social Distortion album Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes. *Tim O'Brien and Darrell Scott covered the song for their 2013 album Memories and Moments. *Blue Grass Boogiemen covered the song on their Hits of Hank Williams album. *16 Horsepower covered the song on their album Folklore. *Dave Matthews and Neil Young covered it on \\"Help F OK R Haiti\\", the fund-raising album produced in 2010 to benefit the victims of the Haitian earthquake that spring.

It is a popular seafood in southeastern Asia. In the 1980s, research was undertaken in China into its aquaculture, and it is now bred in ponds in that country before being released into the sea to grow to a mature size suitable for the fishery. Description Like other members of the order Rhizostomae, the medusa stage of Rhopilema esculentum has no tentacles at the margin of the bell. Instead, underneath the bell it has eight highly branched oral arms, fused at the base and with numerous secondary mouth openings. The bell is rigid, tough and thick with a smooth surface. It is usually suffused with red. Distribution and habitat Rhopilema esculentum is found in western Japan, the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea and the North Malayan Sea. It drifts with the currents and is found near the surface in calm weather. It is swept inshore by the rising tide and drifts back out as the tide falls. Aquaculture and fishery Millions of pond-reared jellyfish with a bell diameter of around are released into suitable locations such as Liaodong Bay, in Liaodong Province, China, between May and June each year. They grow rapidly and permits are issued allowing fishing some two months later, the optimum fishing period being around mid-August. The fishing grounds are shallow semi-enclosed locations with large tidal flows, freshwater inflows and abundant food. The average weight of a jellyfish when harvested is , and in 2005, the recovery rate of reared jellyfish was 3.2%, with a total of 12,500 tons of reared jellyfish being caught. The maximum bell diameter of the jellyfish is around in mid-September, after which time the bell begins to shrink. Use as food This jellyfish is a popular item of food in China and other southern and eastern Asian countries. It can be eaten raw as a salad and has a crisp texture. Cooking jellyfish requires skill because it shrinks at temperatures above . It is normally preserved by treatment with solutions of alum and salt. The excess salt needs to be removed before cooking. Various jellyfish foods are available on the Chinese market including artificial jellyfish products made largely from sodium alginate. Medicinal uses Traditional Chinese medicine advocates the consumption of this jellyfish to treat arthritis, high blood pressure, asthma, burns, ulcers and other ailments; however, further research is needed to verify these claims. Protein isolated from R. esculentum has been shown to have antioxidant and insecticidal properties.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature also cites very old collections in Burma, China and Tibet. The genus Lyriothemis is made up of 15 species and is widespread across Asia. Three species in the genus are known from India; L. cleis, L. tricolor and L. acigastra. All three were thought to be restricted to the northeastern states of Assam and West Bengal, but, in 2013, L. acigastra and L. tricolor were recorded in the southern state of Kerala. Description It is a small dragonfly with brown- capped greenish-yellow eyes. Its thorax is blackish brown, marked with yellow. There is a broad oval antehumeral (situated in front of the fore legs) stripe and a short transverse stripe bordering it just below. Laterally there are three stripes. The wings are transparent, and palely tinted with yellow at the extreme base. The abdomen in the male is blood-red, tapered from base to end, and marked with black. Segment 1 is black, with its apical border narrowly red. Segment 2 has its base broadly black and apical border less so. Segments 3 to 8 have the borders narrowly black and the mid-dorsal carina broadly so. This mid-dorsal black stripe dilate at the apical ends of 3 to 6. Segment 9 has only a narrow short red stripe on each side. Segment 10 is entirely black. The anal appendages are black. The female is similar to the male, except that the abdomen is cylindrical rather than tapered from base to end and is a reddish-yellow color instead of blood red. Habitat Little is known about the species's ecology or habitat, which could be because of its rarity and secretive nature. The specimens reported in 2013 were found in bushes around freshwater marshland and streams. Individuals were generally at their most active in the evening and morning; males rested at around from the ground, and preyed upon skippers and small moths. The species closely resembles the Sri Lankan species L. defonsekai, described in 2009.

He was given the appointment by President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan in 2012. He and the management team were relieved of their appointments to strengthen the on-going reforms in NNPC by ex-President Goodluck Jonathan on July, 2014 and Joseph Dawha was named as his successor in 2014.  Life  Yakubu was born on 10th Sept, 1955 in Mawukili, Northern Region (now in southern Kaduna State), Nigeria. Yakubu is a philanthropist who has contributed to various charity projects in multiple churches and organizations across Nigeria. Over the years he has continually supported the needy by way of donations, sponsorship and scholarships for the poor using his foundation. He was given the chieftaincy title ‚ÄúIya AÃ†tyap‚Äù by the Atyap Chiefdom of Kaduna State in 2004, and is a full member of the Atyap Council of Chiefs.

Thereafter, he attended the College of Arts and Science in Zaria until 1975, when he entered the Ahmadu Bello University there, studying chemical engineering. After graduating with a BA in 1979, he served various roles in refineries before becoming executive director of operations at NETCO in March 2005. In addition to his education in chemistry, he received a certificate in Strategy and Organization from Stanford University's Graduate School of Business Studies.  Career  He left his NETCO role in December 2006 to work at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, first as general manager and ultimately as managing director and CEO. He assumed the role several months after a national fuel crisis in Nigeria, when the NNPC was widely perceived as a corrupt organization, and oversaw changes within the national institution until he was removed during President Jonathan's regime on allegations of insubordination. Yakubu's intervention led to the gas supply to the Nigerian market growing from 300 million cubic feet per day (mcfpd) to 1500mcfpd, of which 70% was dedicated to support the power sector. He sustained stability in the supply and distribution of petroleum products across the country, with Nigeria's three refineries running efficiently during his tenure. He streamed Fluid Catalytic Cracking Units (FCC) in Kaduna refinery, Port Harcourt FCC was operational, while Warri refinery was also on stream through the efforts of the in-house experts he engaged. He is a Fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers; Fellow of the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers; a Fellow of the Nigerian Association of Technologists in Engineering; Associate Fellow, Chemical Society of Nigeria and a registered Engineer of the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria COREN. He is a fellow of the Nigerian Association of Technologist in Engineering. His honors include the Presidential Merit Award by the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers (1997) and the GMD of NNPC Award (1987). Sack from The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Yakubu was relieved from his post as the group Managing Director of the NNPC by President Goodluck Jonathan over perceived infighting between him and the Minister of Petroleum Diezani Alison-Madueke over whom to appoint as the Managing Director of Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Limited (NPDC). The Presidency on the other hand said the NNPC management team was sacked to strengthen the on-going reforms in the organization. On 3 February 2017, a huge amount of cash (USD 9.8 Million and GBP 72,000) was found in a residence belonging to him in the city of Kaduna, Nigeria by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) team. Yakubu reported to the commission's zonal office in Kano and made a statement wherein he admitted ownership of the money, claiming it was \\"gifts\\" from unnamed persons. The anti-corruption agency, EFCC charged Yakubu to court for false declaration of assets, over the discovery of $9.8m in his Kaduna residence. He has not been found guilty by any court of law for corruption in Nigeria. He however filed a billion Naira suit against the EFCC and the Attorney General of the Federation for damages in March, 2017.

It inspired a successful 1961 musical of the same name, which was made into a movie in 1967. Description The book is a satire of an instructional manual, very similar in form and subject matter to Stephen Potter's Gamesmanship. How to Succeed satirizes office life in the United States in the guise of a self-help book. Its subtitle is \\"The Dastard's Guide to Fame and Fortune\\". Inspiration How to Succeed was inspired by Mead's corporate experiences at the Benton & Bowles advertising agency, which he joined in 1936 as a mail-room clerk, eventually working his way up to a vice-presidency. During his journey up the corporate ladder, Mead wrote the book in his spare time‚Äîbefore work and on weekends. The book was a best-seller. Musical adaptation In 1961, the book was adapted into a musical by Dr. Jacob Weinstock, and Willie Gilbert. To successfully bring the piece to Broadway, the renowned Abe Burrows was brought in as co writer, and Frank Loesser was brought in to write the music. The musical differs significantly from the book. It satirizes Mead's own career by depicting the rise of eager young J. Pierrepont Finch, a window-washer who joins a huge corporation by starting in the mail room, and becomes chairman of the board two weeks later. The musical starred Robert Morse as the young striver J. Pierrepont Finch, Rudy Vallee as the company president J.B. Biggley, and Charles Nelson Reilly as Biggley's perpetually peeved nephew Bud Frump. The musical was a smash hit, with a Broadway run of 1,417 performances between October 1961 and March 1965. It won eight Tony Awards and the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for best drama. It was adapted into a movie, also starring Morse and Vallee with Anthony 'Scooter' Teague as Frump, in 1967. It was successfully revived on Broadway in 1995, starring Matthew Broderick as Finch, and again in 2011 with Daniel Radcliffe playing the role. Then in 2012, Darren Criss played the role of Finch for a three-week engagement, and was replaced by Nick Jonas who took the lead until the show closed on May 20, 2012. In 2020 the show was adapted into Japanese with Takahisa Masuda playing the role of Finch. Chris Bailey was the director and choreographer for the Japan show.

Johnson & Company was a partnership between three men who pioneered navigation on the Colorado River. Benjamin M. Hartshorne, George Alonzo Johnson and Alfred H. Wilcox. The George A. Johnson & Company was formed in the fall of 1852, and was reorganized as the Colorado Steam Navigation Company in 1869. History Early attempts to navigate the Colorado and formation of the partnership The three partners that formed the business came from various walks of life. But all had previous experience dealing with the extreme conditions of the Colorado River during their earlier frustrated attempts to bring supplies up that river to Fort Yuma. At that time Fort Yuma was one of the most remote and difficult to reach places in the United States. It had been at first supplied from San Francisco to San Diego by sea and from there overland across the Colorado Desert at the exorbitant rate of $500 per ton. Richard E. Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 =Alfred H. Wilcox= The expense of land transport drove the Army in November 1850 to send an expedition to attempt to carry supplies from San Francisco to the Gulf of California and 150 miles up the river to the Fort. The attempt was made in the Army transport schooner, Invincible under Captain Alfred H. Wilcox, one of the future partners of the company. The expedition was commanded by Lieutenant George Derby. The schooner arrived in San Diego to pick up the rations, then proceeded to the mouth of the Colorado River, stopping only at Cabo San Lucas and Guaymas. The Invincible arrived at the river mouth on December 25. Captain Wilcox then ascended the river but with difficulty. Invincible drawing 8 feet of water was grounded at every ebb tide which was extreme in the Colorado River Delta. The expedition encountered difficulty in the estuary of the Colorado when the Invincible was nearly sunk by the tidal bore that regularly occurred following the ebb tide there. On January 3, 1850, some 30 miles up river Captain Wilcox was forced to drop anchor, his way blocked by shoals too shallow to pass. Local Cocopah people there that day agreed to carry a message to Fort Yuma of the arrival of the ship. After waiting without answer to their message until 11 January, Derby, who due to an old and inaccurate British chart of the river mouth, believed the fort to be nearby instead of 120 miles away and attempted to continue up the river to reach the fort with the ship's longboat. Two days later they met the fort commander, Major Samuel P. Heintzelman coming down the river in a boat. Arraignments were made to unload the ship at its anchorage on the shore of Sonora and loaded onto wagons sent from the fort on 28 January. Wilcox and Derby then returned with the Invincible to San Francisco. Lieutenant Derby, in his expedition report, recommended that a shallow draft stern-wheel steamboat would be the way to send supplies up river to the fort. Report of the Secretary of War, communicating ... a reconnaissance of the Gulf of California and the Colorado river by Lieutenant Derby, Senate Executive Doc. #81, 32nd Congress, 1st Session, Washington, 1852 =Hartshorne and Johnson= The next attempt was made by the contractors George Alonzo Johnson with his partner Benjamin M. Hartshorne who had met when they first came as partners in an enterprise to establish a ferry at the Yuma Crossing. There they built and began operating a ferry, then sold it and returned to San Francisco. Autobiography and Reminiscence of George Alonzo Johnson, San Diego, 1901. p.14 These partners got a contract to supply the fort, and arrived at the river's mouth in February 1852, on the United States transport schooner Sierra Nevada under Captain Wilcox.Executive Documents of the Senate of the United States, No. 37, Report of the Secretary of War, showing the contracts made under the authority of the War Department during the year 1853. p.23 On board were 250 tons of supplies for the newly reoccupied fort and a pair of knocked down flatboats, built by Domingo Marcucci in San Francisco. Scott, Erving M. and Others, Evolution of Shipping and Ship-Building in California, Part I, Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, Volume 25, January 1895, pp.5-16; from quod.lib.umich.edu accessed December 14, 2014 These they assembled to be poled up the Colorado. However the first barge sank with its cargo a total loss. The second was finally, after a long struggle poled up to Fort Yuma, but what little it carried was soon consumed by the garrison. Subsequently, wagons again were sent from the fort to haul the balance of the supplies overland from the estuary through the marshes and woodlands of the Delta. Both of these attempts on the river failed in the face of extreme tides in the estuary or strong currents, shifting sand bars or low water in the river. Hauling supplies from the estuary worked but was less satisfactory than the 185 mile San Diego route over land. Firstly it was a violation of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo for American troops to intrude into Mexican territory. Secondly, on top of already costly land shipping was the prospect of the additional expense of Mexican custom duties that would be levied on anything landed on Mexican territory. =Success of the Uncle Sam= After the failure of Hartshorne and Johnson, James Turnbull, obtained the next contract to supply the fort. He followed the recommendation of Lt. Derby, sailing with supplies and the disassembled Uncle Sam, a 65-foot long side-wheel paddle steamer tug, (also built by Domingo Marcucci), to the Colorado River Delta, in the schooner Capacity. There he had the vessel re-assembled at a landing in the delta in two months. Turnbull then successfully brought supplies up the Colorado River 120 miles in 15 days from the Colorado River Delta to Fort Yuma, where he arrived December 3, 1852. He then took some passengers from the fort up the river for a few miles as a celebration of the success before returning to bring up more supplies. Equipped with only a 20-horsepower engine, the Uncle Sam could only carry 35 tons of supplies, It made trips for four more months up and down the river to finish carrying the supplies from the Capacity to the fort reducing its time for a round trip to 12 days. Negligence caused the Uncle Sam to sink at its dock below Fort Yuma, and was then washed away before it could be raised, in the spring flood of May 1853. Turnbull who meanwhile had returned to the Delta from San Francisco with another cargo and a more powerful engine for the Uncle Sam. Finding it lost he returned for a new hull, while the army sent wagons to recover the cargo from the delta. However, Turnbull disappeared from San Francisco, leaving creditors unpaid. However, Turnbull had shown the worth of steamboats to solve Fort Yuma's supply problem and to successfully navigate the Colorado River, an example that was soon followed by George Alonzo Johnson and his partners. Beginning and growth of the business =George A. Johnson & Company established= In late 1852, George Alonzo Johnson with his partner Hartshorne and new partner Captain Wilcox (formerly of the Invincible and \\"Sierra Nevada\\"), formed George A. Johnson & Company. Turnbull's financial debacle allowed them to obtain the next contract to supply the fort. Johnson and his partners, all having learned a lesson from their failed attempts ascending the Colorado and with the example of the Uncle Sam, brought the parts of a more powerful side-wheel steamboat, the General Jesup, with them to the mouth of the Colorado from San Francisco. There it was reassembled at a landing in the upper tidewater of the river and reached Fort Yuma, January 18, 1854. This new boat, capable of carrying 50 tons of cargo, was very successful making round trips from the estuary to the fort in only four or five days. Costs were cut to $75 per ton. The route made the Company $4,000 per trip per ship in the estuary of the Colorado River. A second reason for the speed of the new steamboat beside its powerful engine was the establishment of wood- yard landings along the river between the delta and Fort Yuma by associates contracted by the company. The landings sprang up to supply wood for the steamboats, so the crew would not need to gather wood as they proceeded up river, as the crew of the Uncle Sam had been obliged to do. These landings were each located at about the distance a steamboat could travel up and down river each day on that section of river. Steamboats did not travel at night, due to the danger of running onto sandbars or into snags on the ever-changing river. The boats would be re supplied with cut wood at the landings while tied up overnight. The wood-yards were owned by Yankee's, who hired the Cocopah from local rancherias, to cut the wood (usually cottonwood or mesquite), transport it to the wood-yards and load it onto the boats. Cocopah men often also served as deck hands on the boats, having lived along and on the river for a lifetime, they were well qualified to spot river hazards in a timely manner. Felger, Richard Stephen, Flora of the Gran Desierto and Rio Colorado of Northwestern Mexico, University of Arizona Press, 2000, pp.30-31 =Growth of the business= In August 1854, while trying to make time up river against the current, the boiler of the General Jesup exploded, killing her engineer, named Jackson, and seriously scalding two others. By December 1854, the boat was running again, with new machinery sent down from San Francisco. In an era where boiler explosions were common, this was the only such incident seen in Johnson's company or its successors until the end of steam navigation on the Colorado. From 1853, ranches were developed nearby up river to supply the fort with beef and barley. That same year gold was found up river. By 1854, copper mines were developed along the river 40 miles above Fort Yuma. The ore provided George A. Johnson & Company with their first commercial cargo to take to the estuary anchorage. Old Mexican mines where reopened in the interior of the Gadsden Purchase that increased the traffic bringing in machinery and shipping out ore. By 1855, the volume of cargo necessitated putting another boat on the river. By December 1855, Johnson had John G. North build and bring in sections a new steamboat from San Francisco to the Delta estuary. There North assembled and launched the 120-foot-long, 80 hp, wood-hulled Colorado.Scott, Erving M. and Others, Evolution of Shipping and Ship-Building in California, Part II, Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, Volume 25, February 1895, p. 123 It was capable of carrying 70 tons of cargo while drawing only 2 feet of water and was the first stern-wheeler on the river. Once the backlog of cargo was relieved by the Colorado, Johnson looked for ways to keep his boats from being idle. He knew that Brigham Young wanted to establish a route to the Mormon settlements in Utah from the sea up the Colorado River and that merchant interests had been interested in establishing trade with the Mormons by the river route since 1852 when the Uncle Sam came to the river. Additionally there was the claim that the river was navigable by steamboat as far as the Virgin River by the fur trapper Antoine Leroux who had successfully rafted down the Colorado from the Virgin River in 1837. Johnson was instrumental in getting Congressional funding for a military expedition to explore the Colorado River above Fort Yuma in 1856. Johnson lent Ives one of his men David C. Robinson as a pilot for the expedition. However, cut out of providing the steamboat for the 1857 expedition of Lt. Ives, Johnson at his own expense took the lead in the General Jesup heading up river first, exploring the river up to a point 8 miles into Pyramid Canyon to its first rapids, now under Lake Mohave, between Arizona and Nevada. Despite the successful exploration up the river, the lands along the upper river did not begin to be settled until after the 1858-59 Mohave War and the establishment of Fort Mohave. The General Jesup and the newer stern-wheeler Colorado where engaged to carry troops and supplies up river for the Mohave Expeditions at $500 per day, and thereafter contracted to support the army posts of Camp Gaston and Camp Mohave, later Fort Mohave. Support of Fort Mohave became the first economic incentive for the steamboats up river. This was soon followed by the support of settlements created by the rush to various gold, silver and copper mining locations near the river in the next decades. With the discovery of the Gila Placers by Jacob Snively came the first Arizona gold rush in 1858‚Äì1859, which created the ephemeral Gila City just east of Fort Yuma on the Gila River. Early in 1859, placer gold was found eighteen miles above Fort Yuma at the Pot Holes on the west bank of the Colorado River in California. In August 1859 Johnson retired the General Jesup and replaced it with the 140 foot Stern-wheeler Cocopah. Its shallow 19 inch draft and stern-wheel was better suited to transit the upper Colorado route, and was the model for all the steamboats on the river thereafter. In 1860, gold was found in placers at La Laguna. In April 1861, as the American Civil War began, word got out that silver and gold lodes had been discovered by John Moss and others in El Dorado Canyon, sixty five miles above Fort Mohave near what was then considered the high water limit of navigation. George A. Johnson came up river and made a deal to supply the mines with his steamboats at $100 a ton, a lower price than the $240 a ton charged for overland freight across the Mohave Desert from Los Angeles. Civil War on the Colorado River In response to the establishment of Confederate Arizona, California Volunteers of the Union Army took control of the Yuma ferries, built up the garrison and provisions at Fort Yuma and strengthened its fortifications, all with supplies brought from San Francisco with the aid of Johnson's steamboats. The California Column launched its campaign to cut off the Confederate Army of the New Mexico Campaign and retake Confederate Arizona in 1862, and based its subsequent occupation of New Mexico Territory on its depot in Arizona City, again provisioned by Johnson's steamboats. When Fort Mohave was reoccupied by California Volunteers in 1864 it was supplied as before by Johnson's steamboats. These Federal contracts were the base of Johnson's revenue but it was soon greatly supplemented by a mining boom along the Colorado and in the interior of Arizona. In January 1862, Pauline Weaver discovered gold while trapping along the Arizona side of the Colorado River 130 miles above Fort Yuma. After he brought a crew of Sonorans from Gila City to dry wash the site with good results, the rush to what became the La Paz Mining District began, with new strikes being found within 20 miles to the east and south of the original strike near what came to be the town of La Paz. The Pyramid Mining District east of El Dorado Canyon and the river in the Black Mountains and in the vicinity of Fort Mohave the San Francisco Mining District northeast of the fort in the Black Mountains were established in 1863. The Sacramento Mining District 37 miles from Fort Mohave were established by soldiers in September 1863, to the east beyond the Black Mountains in the southern end of the Cerbat Mountains. A party led by John Moss founded the Waubau Yuma Mining District in the Hualapai Mountains 50 miles east of Fort Mohave. West of the fort in the Providence Mountains of California, silver was found and the Rock Springs Mining District was established in April 1863 and the Macedonia Mining District in September 1864. Soldiers from Fort Mohave established the Irataba Mining District in early 1863 when they found copper five miles west of the river in the Dead Mountains of California. First the landing at Mohave City was founded near Fort Mohave. Then Irataba City, followed in January 1864 but it was supplanted when the ferry and landing of Hardyville was established in March 1864, to serve these mines, supported by Johnson's steamboat company. North of La Paz a copper strike 12 miles east of the river led to organizion of the Williams Fork Mining District with its landing at Aubrey City. Copper was also found west of Aubrey City and the river in California, in the Freeman Mining District, and southeast of Aubrey City in the Harcuvar Mining District named for the Harcuvar Mountains 35 miles east of the river and 55 miles northeast of La Paz and a few miles north of the La Paz - Wikenburg Road. New placers were found in the fall of 1862, 50 miles south of La Paz on the California side of the river in the Picacho Mining District with Reliance Landing serving it 47 miles up river from Fort Yuma. Across the river in Arizona gold was found in the Castle Dome Mountains to the north of it silver-lead ore was found which created the Castle Dome Mining District in spring of 1863. Castle Dome Landing was established to serve this district. In 1864, silver and gold were found in the Eureka Mining District 40 miles north of Fort Yuma across the river from the Picacho District in the Chocolate Mountains. It was served by the Williamsport landing 47 miles up river from Fort Yuma. John Ross Browne, Resources of the Pacific Slope: With a Sketch of the Settlement and Exploration of Lower California, I. H. Bancroft and Company, San Francisco, 1869 In the interior of Arizona above the Gila River Fort Whipple was established and gold mines, mining camps and the towns of Prescott and Wickenburg boomed in the mining districts of Agua Frio, Big Bug, Bradshaw, Hassyampa, Turkey Creek, Walnut Grove, Weaver, Wikenburg and Yavapai. These were also all primarily supplied by the La Paz - Wikenburg Road and Hardyville - Prescott Road from those landings on the Colorado River. The Colorado River Gold Rush had made George A. Johnson and his partners rich. Johnson and Wilcox married into Californio ranchero families. Johnson acquired Rancho Pe√±asquitos, went into politics and was elected to the California legislature for San Diego in 1862. Wilcox became a banker in San Diego and lived at Rancho Melijo. Hartshorne who was president of the company operating the business from San Francisco, invested his new wealth in the California Steam Navigation Company, and became its president in 1865. Management of the steamboat fleet at the river was delegated to Issac Polhamus its senior captain. However the Colorado River business based on government contracts for the military was now being overwhelmed by the trade from the mines and settlements dependent on the river. Worse, the Johnson Company had failed to increase its carrying capacity on the river. Despite rebuilding the worn Colorado I into the larger Colorado II in 1862, Johnson still only had two steamboats on the river as they had from 1859. Opposition lines, competition and monopoly =Opposition Lines Arise 1863 - 1864= By late 1863, supplies for the mines and settlements were piling up on ships at anchor in the Delta or on the dock in Arizona City, not getting through in sufficient volume to prevent shortages and cause prices up river and in the interior to skyrocket. Ore from the mines to be shipped out to be processed was piling up on the docks of the landings along the river. The Cocopah made round trips up river from Arizona City to the La Paz landings during the high water mouths of May and June at its full capacity of sixty tons of freight in four days, amounting to four hundred tons a month. However, as the river level subsequently declined the trips became slower and could carry less cargo. By December Cocopah could only manage eighty tons a month, barely able to make only two trips with forty tons in that time. Trips farther up river to the vicinity of Fort Mohave took at least twice as long. The same difficulty plagued the Colorado carrying cargo between the estuary and Arizona City. By the fall of 1863 there was a backlog of twelve hundred tons of freight at Arizona City or in ships anchored in the estuary waiting to be brought up river. Between ten and fifty tons of ore waiting to be brought down to the estuary at each of the landings up river above Arizona City. Some of this cargo had been waiting for couple of months and most would have to wait until May and the rise of the Colorado. From the beginning the Johnson Company rates were considered excessive compared to those on other Western rivers. Additionally merchants at La Paz 280 miles up river objected to the $75 per ton charged by the Johnson Company, while Williamsport 80 miles down river paid only $25 per ton. Now in the summer and fall of 1863 as merchants upriver rapidly ran out of goods and prices rose astronomically. Steamboat captains and their officers took advantage of the situation by purchasing needed goods on their own account then carried them up river to sell for a quick profit at the now inflated prices, leaving behind identical shipments consigned to the merchants. However even these shipments ended in November when an extreme fall in the river left the Cocopah stranded on a sandbar thirty miles above La Paz. Merchants and miners held a protest meeting at La Paz on December 1, 1863. It condemned the Johnson Company as a monopoly, that was trying to drive the miners out in order to gain control of the mines. The meeting voted to send a representative to San Francisco with a petition calling for the establishment of an opposition steamboat line on the Colorado River. In San Francisco, their representative Samuel \\"Steamboat\\" Adams convinced the Chamber of Commerce to endorse a rival line. Merchants of the city raised $25,000 by subscription, and Adams persuaded Captain Thomas Trueworthy, to send the steamboat Esmerelda under Captain Charles C. Overman and the Victoria, a four-masted schooner converted from a barge, to the Colorado River to establish the Union Line there. The Victoria was to be a store ship at the mouth of the river, but she was soon broken up by the tidal bore soon after it reached the mouth of the Colorado in March. After Overman arrived at the river mouth he built the Black Crook, first tow barge to be used on the Colorado River. Of a type commonly used on the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento River and its tributaries, the barge was 128 x 28 feet capable of carrying 100 tons of freight. These barges were towed on a 100-foot cable secured to a short mast atop the steamboat amid-ship to avoid fouling with the stern-wheel. Each barge had a helmsman that steered the barge in the wake of the boat towing it. In early May, Trueworthy took the Esmerelda up river for the first time with the Black Crook in tow making it to Fort Yuma in three days, eight hours. With Johnson Company raising freight rates to and from his mines in El Dorado Canyon and the Freeman District in late 1863, and with the potential freighting profits to be made competing with it, Alphonso F. Tilden, of the Philadelphia Silver and Copper Mining Company, put a second Opposition steamboat on the river, the Nina Tilden. Built in San Francisco by Martin Vice and launched in July 1864, it was able to do 16 knots while it carried 120 tons and would tow a 100-ton barge. A veteran captain of the Sacramento and Fraser Rivers, George B. Gorman, steamed the Nina Tilden down the coast to the Colorado River. In September, Gorman also began to compete with the Johnson Company and the Union Line, towing the barge White Fawn, knocked down and shipped in a schooner to the estuary where it was reassembled. =Competition 1864 - 1866= Once Johnson realized the seriousness of the situation he ordered a new steamboat, Mohave that would be ready in May 1864. In the meanwhile he got control of as much of the cargo being held up in the estuary as he could by means of using his boats shipping it a short way up river from the estuary to the landing at Gridiron, whereby he obtained a lien on the cargo so his competitors could not take it. This left his competitors with less idled freight to carry and needing agents from San Francisco to ship new freight through them, instead of to Johnson & Company. Johnson also bought out most of the wood at the woodyard landings along the river so his opposition would be slowed by the necessity to have to gather up their own firewood or establish their own system of wood-yards. Daily Alta California, Volume 16, Number 5267, 4 August 1864, p.1, col.4 The Johnson Company also cut shipping charges to La Paz landing to $40 a ton, in an attempt to pacify the merchants there. Additionally, \\"Steamboat\\" Adams accused Johnson & Company of sending men to attack Esmeralda by damaging her machinery, setting fires, cutting her moorings and attempting to wreck her with floating logs. Her owner Trueworthy, complained Johnson's pressure on insurance brokers in San Francisco prevented him from getting insurance on his boat and cargo. Soon after the Esmeralda and its barge began running on the river, the Mohave was launched in May giving Johnson 3 boats to carry goods, just as the flood waters came making rapid and heavily laden trips possible. By September, the Nina Tilden, was also carrying goods up river, making 5 boats and 2 barges that soon ended the backlog of freight, producing its opposite condition, boats sitting idle by the fall of 1864. Cushioned by their government contracts Johnson & Company was not as vulnerable, but Tilden and Trueworthy needed more commercial revenue to make a go of it. The only new business to be had by the opposition was to service the settlements Utah, up river at a landing called Callville cutting costs of transportation by $100 a ton, one third of the cost of the overland route from Los Angeles. Trueworthy proposed to do this at all times of the year, and tried to take the Esmerelda there in early 1865, towing a barge loaded with merchandise and timber, but turned back at the Roaring Rapids in Black Canyon, when word came that his buyers had left Callville. Trueworthy had to tie up his boat at El Dorado Canyon and ride to Salt Lake City to sell his cargo. Johnson associate William Harrison Hardy had succeeded in getting there first, leaving January 2, poling and sailing (when the wind was favoable) a 50 by 8 foot flat boat \\"Arizona\\" 90 miles from Hardyville to Callville in 12 days. =Consolidation 1866 - 1867= In the summer of 1865, Esmerelda of the Union Line, was consolidated with the other rival boat Tilden's Nina Tilden, into the Pacific and Colorado Steam Navigation Company, also headed by Thomas E. Trueworthy, with backing from San Francisco financiers. Trueworthy tried again to reach Callville during the high water in the summer of 1866. Esmeralda with a barge and ninety tons of freight, under Trueworthy's former first mate Captain Robert T. Rogers. After three months, the Esmeralda reached the landing at Callville on October 8, 1866. She was slowed by lack of firewood and (at what became known as the Ringbolt Rapids), with insufficient power to ascend the rapids, a ringbolt had had to be set in the canyon wall and the boat pulled through with a line run to her capstan. Despite her triumph at reaching the new \\"head of navigation\\" at Callvile, Esmerelda upon her return to Arizona City, was seized by the Sheriff of Yuma County, for debts owned by Thomas E. Trueworthy's company. She passed through the hands of Arizona Navigation Company, another company the creditors tried to form hoping to salvage the opposition steamboat business but that failed. =Monopoly 1867-1869= When the last attempt of salvaging the Opposition steamboat line failed, Esmerelda and Nina Tilden were sold in the fall of 1867, to George A. Johnson & Company. Underpowered and small for the Colorado River, the company had the boat dismantled in 1868. The Nina Tilden continued in use on the river, until she was retired to Port Isabel in 1873. In 1869, the company was reorganized with an infusion of more capital and with additional partners, as the Colorado Steam Navigation Company.

Raffert (March 11, 1927 ‚Äì March 3, 2005) was a German American chef who was White House Executive Chef from 1988 to 1992. He was the first White House chef to annually build a gingerbread house for the Executive Residence's Christmas holiday decorations. Early life and work Raffert was born March 11, 1927, in Hildesheim, Germany. His father was a baker, which sparked his interest in cooking. At the age of 14, as was typical for boys in Germany at the time, he entered an apprenticeship, and chose cooking as a career. He worked four days a week, and spent two days in school. His apprenticeship ended in 1941 when he was 17. With World War II raging, he chose to enlist in the Kriegsmarine, the Nazi German navy. Enlisting meant that he would avoid being conscripted into the Wehrmacht, where he was much more likely to die. As a cook in the navy, he also avoided much of the hunger that afflicted the average German during the latter part of the war. Raffert trained at a number of hotels and resorts in West Germany after the war. In 1951 he moved to Switzerland, but emigrated to Stockholm, Sweden, in 1952 in order to take advantage of the immense demand for chefs generated by the 1952 Winter Olympics in nearby Oslo, Norway. He spent the next seven and a half years in Sweden, working a various hotels. For three and a half of these years, he worked aboard cruise ships of the Swedish American Line, during which he made three around-the-world cruises. After spending the summer of 1957 working in York, United Kingdom, he emigrated to the United States even though he spoke very little English. He spent about a year working at hotels in New York City, including the Hotel McAlpin. He then moved to Washington, D.C., where he spent eight years working as the chef de cuisine (executive chef) at the Hotel Washington. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1966. White House years In 1969, White House Executive Chef Henry Haller hired Raffert as sous-chef in the White House. Raffert was one of only six staff members on the White House kitchen staff. (The staff consisted of the executive chef, a sous-chef, a kitchen assistant, the pastry chef, a pastry assistant, and a pot-washer.) Due to a delay in obtaining his security clearance, Raffert did not arrive at the White House until the day before Haller was due to leave for vacation. This left Raffert having to oversee planning, preparation, and cooking for a state dinner for West German Chancellor Willy Brandt three days later. In November 1969, Raffert created the first official White House gingerbread house. Haller retired on October 1, 1987, and was replaced by chef Jon Hill. But Hill proved unpopular with First Lady Nancy Reagan, and resigned on January 8, 1988, after just five months on the job. Raffert was appointed Acting Executive Chef on January 9. Raffert was permanently named to the position on March 3. Although the White House interviewed several candidates, Raffert's experience on the job and the high level of competency he displayed during his one and a half months as Acting Executive Chef convinced the First Lady that Raffert was the right candidate for the job. He was the first White House Executive Chef to be promoted from within the ranks, rather than be brought in from outside the White House. His salary in 1969 was $13,389 a year. During his time at the White House, as sous-chef and executive chef, Raffert planned, prepared, and cooked for the First Family as well as for state dinners and other formal and informal social functions at the White House. Among some of the major events he cooked for were a \\"welcome home\\" for 1,200 former Vietnam War prisoners of war on the South Lawn of the White House on May 24, 1973, and a September 1978 dinner for 1,300 on the South Lawn to celebrate the signing of the Camp David accords. He enjoyed cooking for the First Family very much. First Lady Pat Nixon liked roast duck (a Raffert favorite as well), while President Jimmy Carter and his family a large meant on Sundays after church and were very much like the average American family. (First Daughter Amy Carter would bake cookies in the White House kitchen, overseen by Raffert.) He also approved of the way First Lady Nancy Reagan handled state dinner menus, personally approving the food and wine choices rather than allowing a committee of staff to argue at length over them. Raffert was the first White House chef to create a gingerbread house as part of the Executive Residence Christmas decorations. Raffert was 60 when he became Executive Chef, and retired in October 1992 just before he turned 65. A confessed \\"nibbler\\" as he cooked, Raffert lost after retiring. Frank Ruta, a Washington, D.C.-based chef who trained under Raffert at the White House, later said \\"Hans was a guy that could do it all. He could do it all, and he could do it all quickly, efficiently, neatly. He was just a walking encyclopedia of classical cooking.\\" Personal life and death Raffert's marriage to his first wife, Annemarie (a native of Austria who emigrated to the United States when she was 16 years old), ended in divorce. They had a son, Patrick. Raffert married his second wife, Doris (a medical secretary), in 1976. The couple lived in Alexandria, Virginia. Raffert died on March 3, 2005, in Alexandria. He was survived by his wife, Doris, and his son, Patrick, as well as a brother, Konrad Raffert of Clarksburg, Maryland. A funeral Mass was held at St. Louis Catholic Church in Alexandria. He was cremated, and inurned at Mount Comfort Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia.

The Exserohilum species are known for causing blight and human immune system diseases. The sexual reproductive (or ascigerous) states of Exserohilum species are known as Setosphaeria. The type species is Exserohilum turcicum. This genus is among three dematiaceous that are categorized for containing pathogens leading to diseases like phaeohyphomycosis.  Morphology  Exserohilum is an asexual organism that reproduces through spores. These one-celled reproductive units are concave and can be seen in the suspensor. Taxonomy Exserohilum was circumscribed by K. Leonard and Edna Suggs in 1974 to contain species formerly placed in Bipolaris with distinctly protruding hila. Exsero which means stretch out and hilum which refers to the part of the organism. The truncate hila or hilum, protrudes from its distinct conidia which are ellipsoidal and distoseptate (forming a layer). Colonies of Exserohilum range from the color grey to blackish-brown. The texture varies from suede-like to floccose in texture. The species also have an olivaceous to black reverse. The conidia from which the hilum extends, are either straight, curved, slightly bent or ellipsoidal to fusiform. and are formed on the top through a pore (poroconidia) on an elongated sympodial angled conidiophore. The strong, protruding truncate hilum and the septum above is normally thick and dark. The end cells are paler and the walls finely roughened. The conidial germination of Exserohilum is bipolar. Habitat and distribution Exserohilum has a cosmopolitan distribution, with its species found naturally in warm, tropical, and subtropical locations. They live on plant material like grasses, rotten wood and in the soil.

Main characters ; \\"Shou\\" :The protagonist of the series. He appears to be an easygoing, reckless and somehow comical high-school student known only for constantly arriving late for classes. However, he is in fact one of the results of an experiment from years before by a powerful crime syndicate lord; there are seemingly unlimited Shous throughout the series, each nearly the same as the last. The crime lord, dying of old age, tried to use medicine and advanced technology to revive himself as a youth, and thus create a cloning facility where he experimented with cloning humans and transferring memories and experience from a mind to another, so as to be reborn as an \\"ultimate being\\" However, his plans failed, as he died before his project could be brought into fruition, and thus the numerous Shou clones were scattered far and wide in Japan, until two of them encountered each other by chance, thus prompting all clones to reunite. It is implied from the later chapters that there are over three hundred Shous scattered across Japan. :Because of a flashback involving Katsuragi (Shou's former classmate who died due to cancer caused by tainted medicine), the clones vow to redeem Japan and destroy what they perceive as evil, in a similar way of a terror group. They first go back to their lives for a certain period of time, each of them focusing on a single area of expertise (be it stunt-driving, surgery, military training, and so on), before returning to reunite all their experiences into a 'perfect' Shou; a Shou with all the experience, memories and training of every previous clone. The original clones then commit suicide; the current Shou (who switches up several times throughout the series) is cloned from this first perfect Shou. :While their methods are indeed brutal and extremely shocking, one thing has to be noted: the Shou clones all follows something of a code of conduct named one man, one kill, meaning only the chosen target will be put to death, no matter how many clones would be sacrificed in the process (one such example was the assassination of Takeo Tsuruta, involving the deaths of eighty clones). Obstacles such as police or bodyguards are simply evaded or subdued without deadly force. :All the Shou clones are aided in their acts by a peculiar, demonic mask which not only conceals their identity, but also serves as technologically advanced equipment. When worn, it drills itself into the wearer's skull and links to the brain, so as to assimilate all memories of that Shou and pass it on the others when he dies, normally after a killing. Also, to further prevent the world from understanding who they really are, each mask injects a bomb into the head of a Shou on the brink of death, which makes the head explode so as to prevent recognition and leaves only a headless body behind. :Presenting themselves as terrorists while making heavy use of costumes and even a cartoonish mascot nicknamed \\"Aametsu-kun,\\" the Akumetsu group (the Shou clones) aim at one thing only: to purge Japan of all whom they perceive as \\"evil-doers\\", that is, all those in a position of power who are corrupt and revel in such chaos as a mean to make easy money, or simply those who, while capable of making changes, refuse to do so and only complain. Their executions are always presented as some sort of a show, where usually the Akumetsu, dressed appropriately (from a race driver to a ghost to a businessman) interrogates, frames for their wrongdoings and in the end massacres its intended victims, often in much brutal fashion to which follows his even more grisly death. :Without sermons or pleads, the Akumetsu are also very specific in explaining their motives and objectives to society, and while labeled terrorists by the media and the people, they also gained support from the masses in their bloody quest of disposing of the \\"evil-doers\\". To most of them, Akumetsu became not only the name of the \\"masked men\\", but also a moniker for the killing of those to be blamed for the crisis. :Akumetsu dies at the end of the series, by the mass death of every living Akumetsu clone and the destruction of the clone factory. Most of the Shous die as Akumetsu without their names ever being mentioned, with very few exceptions. At the point where the story begins, all the clones have already 'unified' once and the 'original' ones were killed to be used for raw materials for future clones. It is implied that they go through this process several times throughout the story, so probably the same name has been used by different individuals. ; :The catalyst that starts off the events of Akumetsu, he is the first to use the clone plant and the memory transfer device to 'revive' after receiving a near fatal injury while trying to save Katsuragi from getting run over by a truck. He becomes determined to punish those responsible for his friend Katsuragi's illness and eventual death, and he convinces the other clones to join him in his crusade. He is captured and then brutally tortured to death by Kitagami. This name is a pun on \\"two,\\" as he is the second Shou to be introduced after Hazama. ; :A clone discovered and brought to the Shou conclave by Niikura after the first unification. He neither plays a very big role in the Akumetsu organization nor in the grand scheme, but he plays a central role in the plot in that everything begins and ends with Hazama. He is the only Akumetsu to survive the final battle with the Yakuza, but he sacrifices his own body so that Shiina can continue to live on. This name is a pun on \\"one.\\" ; :Raised in the plant by one of the researchers who originally developed the cloning program, he continues to take care of the clone plant even after the death of \\"Grandma Sachiko.\\" He continues to work on the clone research and eventually perfects the technology. He dies along with the clone plant. ; :Working at the TV station, he is the one who directs all Akumetsu's hijacked broadcasts and the final Akumetsu Documentary. He is killed in the final battle against the soldiers hired by the Takemaru group. ; :Sushi chef, shot and killed by Niikura's teacher Kuronuma who was posing as Akumetsu. ;??? :A clone mistaken to be a distant relative of criminal king pin M Gouda, and is captured and placed in a mental ward run by the Takimaru group. He dies as a lab rat. ;Shou Hayasaka :A reporter. By infiltrating the media, he does most of the investigative work for the group. He leads the decisive final battle against Takimaru and Kitagami. He is shot by Kaori and dies before he could see his friends for the last time. School ; :A schoolgirl and Hazama's best friend, who apparently has a crush on him. Due to her family's debts she was sold as a prostitute and forced to entertain businessmen and politicians, though her very first night of terror was cut short when Shou, wearing his trademark Akumetsu mask, showed up and, much to her horror, mauled to death the man she was ordered to serve. She instantly recognized him by his way of speaking and hairstyle (a recognition which one of the party attendants, an official, notices), though he initially brushed her off. Left shocked and almost catatonic after witnessing the carnage, she was even more appalled to find Shou alive and well the next day at school, though again she is brushed off as a lunatic. The official from the previous night then questions her, and there Shou intervenes and makes a clear statement of his powers, the fact that he is immortal and he \\"can be in more places at once\\". Too shocked to say anything, she is later revealed Shou saved her father from becoming a criminal as a mean to solve his need of money, and when questioning her if the \\"evil- doers\\" should die, she agreed to him. After those events Shiina continued with her normal life, though still left speechless and terrified by the campaign of terror led by the Shou clones. Near the end of the manga, when both she and Shou are near death, Shou uses his last mask to clone her and makes sure she lives on. She's seen years later as a reporter interviewing the former prime minister, who has chosen to become a vagabond. ; :A juvenile delinquent member of the bike gang Blossom, and a classmate of Hazama, who was never convicted of a brutal murder of an elderly citizen during a mugging. Since there was no police investigation, Iwata was allowed to enroll in high school. However, during the time Akumetsu pressured the police to stop a planned ride-through by Blossom, Iwata is killed after crashing into an oncoming car. ; :A teacher at Niikura's school, who is inspired by Akumetsu, and attempts to kill Congressman Tsuruta. However, his botched attempts endanger and kills innocent bystanders, which does not fit in with Akumetsu's 'one-man-one-kill' policy, which causes Shou to angrily refer to him as 'Seimetsu' (Killer of the Just). He is confronted by Shou and is later used as a human weapon to murder Tsurata. Dubbed as Akumetsu #2, Kuronuma is shot by the police, while the wheelchair he was on impaled the corrupt congressman before his mask detonated, killing him. As a teacher he was strict yet ridiculed, and believed in a society still capable of changing itself. ; :A member of Niikura's class who was being bullied into giving away her money. Kuronuma saw this once and tried to help her. She said it was okay but Kuronuma, who had already been worn down from stress, berated her for being made out as a fool while they came off clean. After being encouraged by how much he seemed to care, she went to talk to him while he was making his rounds. When she found him talking to Shou, she overheard that he was Akumetsu. The next day she saw Shou acting like an idiot as he always does questioned how such a person could be connected to a terrorist organization. In the most recent chapters, Shou appears to her and off-handedly tells her that all Akumetsu are clones. He goes on to explain that even though the DNA of the corpses matches his, Shou can't be arrested as the owners of the sample are dead and having identical DNA isn't technically a crime. ; :Shou Niikura's friend who inspired him and the other Shous in turn to become Akumetsu. Diagnosed with congenital afibrinogenemia at birth, he nevertheless becomes a successful stock broker and web novelist under the name of Kei Katsura by the age of 15. Katsuragi later develops liver cancer due to tainted fibrinogen and tries to commit suicide by jumping in front of a truck, but Shou pushes him out of the way and is hit instead. He in turn tries to develop a way to clone Katsuragi to repair his organs, but fails. The two of them grow closer up until Katsuragi passes away, but not before telling Niikura to fix Japan's ills, comparing him to the √ºbermensch and writing him into the last chapter of his webnovel. ; :Katsuragi's stalker who is obsessed with his webnovel, but later becomes his girlfriend. She discovers the clone lab at the same time as Katsuragi. Although she moves away from Tokyo after Katsuragi's death, she later appears to give support to Shou Niikura during the incident at Kyounan High School. Police Department ; :The executive officer and detective of the police force. He despises Akumetsu for murdering his chief, though he also despises his former chief for his indifference, and thus made the capture of Akumetsu his obsession. However, as time passes, he is starting to question Akumetsu's motives, as well as those of the city officials, though still refusing to admit it to himself. ; :Director of Special Investigations of the Tokyo District. Also known as Bloody Mary, because her nose bleeds every time she is in the presence of one or more evil people. She is investigating the Akumetsu crimes, which are targeting the very same group of high-ranking corrupt officials, that she herself could not prosecute. ; :Director of the Kanayama Prefectural Police Department and Yamada's former superior. He is Akumetsu's second victim. Unlike the justice-driven Yamada, Masashi only cared to earn career points for traffic violations and minor crimes, while allowing a vicious street gang called Blossom to roam free, and ignoring the pleas from the citizens. Akumetsu forces him and the police to perform their duties as law officers by taking Masashi as an hostage and, under threat, force his men to perform their duties in stopping the bikers. He had his left hand's fingers blown off first, then his head destroyed by a point-blank shot from Akumetsu. Victims ; :Murase is the Prime Minister of Japan. A weak and indecisive man who believes he is on the highest office of Japan thanks to sheer luck, he was visited by Akumetsu and given a simple, yet chilly ultimatum: since he believed in the Prime Minister's plans, Akumetsu offered him to take upon himself the task of killing all those who he deemed evil, that is, all the corrupt personnel of the Japanese political and economical world. In the meantime, he gave Prime Minister Murase one month to succeed in his restoration plans, or be faced with Akumetsu's wrath and killed himself if he failed (\\"failing\\" including also his resignation from his office or lack of will to accomplish his plans, much to his dismay). It was Murase who coined the nickname Akumetsu, because when he first saw Shou with his mask and an intimidating black suit, he called him an akumetsu, a destroyer of evil. While technically a victim, Murase was not deemed evil by Akumetsu at the end of the month as he was shown to have a completely changed demeanor and attitude. He was seen in the last chapter being interviewed by an adult Shiina, discussing the past and asking about Shou having chosen to live the life of a vagabond after he deemed himself failing to make any significant changes in the government as Prime Minister ; :The Main Metropolitan Bank's consultant and Akumetsu's first victim. He was the perverted official whom Shiina had to degrade herself in front of. He was forced to admit to his crimes toward Japan's failing economy, before being killed by Akumetsu with an axe to the head. ; :Leader of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister's former corrupt rival. He is Akumetsu's third victim. He is shown at the funeral of the aforementioned official. Akumetsu, however, jumped out of the commissioner's coffin, and cross-examined Nakanoshima on national television and delivered his ideals and accusations; including his views on Japan's failing economy. Nakanoshima is, at first, thrown to the special forces bodyguards, until Akumetsu proceeds to break through every one of them (without killing them), despite being shot several times along the way. Akumetsu then takes Nakanoshima with him off a rooftop, and kills him by dragging him in a suicidal jump (performed as a wrestling takedown move). ; :Former member of the Ex-Ministry of Finance, who had allocated tax funds as if it were his own money. As a result, he had been living in an extravagant mansion on money that wasn't his. Shou set fire to the property, while a fleeing Akumetsu killed Zaizen by ramming a speeding fire engine into him. ; :A congressman and former police bureaucrat who sought to be elected as Japan's next Prime Minister. However, his past economic crimes, his proposals for new utility projects and roadways, plus his comment to let 'future generations pay for their parents', made him a target for Akumetsu, and for Kuronuma. Tsuruta survived 3 assassination attempts by Kuronuma, but is finally killed on a live talk show, impaled on a specially-made wheelchair, along with the fake Akumetsu. ; :Congressman, member of the People's Party, and part of the group which pushed for the construction of an unnecessary expressway. He informed Congressman Gamon about the leaked information concerning the deal, then was kidnapped by Akumetsu inside a restroom stall. He was pulled up by way of a hidden fishing line into the ventilation shaft. His dead body was later found and fished out of Tokyo Bay. ; :A former Chief Secretary and Diet Party member, Gamon had pushed for the building of an unnecessary expressway, and only increased Japan's failing economy, while filling his pockets. He is the only one of Akumetsu's targets who freely admits that he is corrupt, though he defends it by saying that clean politicians don't get anything done. He was forced into a race with Akumetsu to validate the need for such a route, noticing too late that, whether he won or lost, he would have been in trouble: should he have won while driving on the apparently inadequate national highway, then the expressway would have been deemed unnecessary. Otherwise, if he lost then the expressway was indeed necessary, but this also would have given the opportunity to Akumetsu to reach Gamon's estate and retrieve incriminating files to frame him for his wrongdoings. After being fooled by Akumetsu, he died with him as the former crashed his car down a constructed road, with Gamon pinned on the chassis. ; :Ex-President of the Great Japan Public Corporation. His obsession over building countless roads, while recklessly depleting public funds made him the next target after Gamon. He was kidnapped from his home, and buried alive with an Akumetsu, underneath a section of the useless expressway that was still under construction. Michinaga was severely beaten in the face as his faults were televised, then he and Akumetsu eventually perished as their oxygen ran out. His statement of 'I am the road' became literal, as police were unable to find the construction site he was buried under. ; :Former Director of the Ministry Health and Welfare's Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau, as well as Former Board Chairman of a Semi- Government Medicine Facility. His crimes included gross mismanagement of blood constituents, malpractice, and financial monopolizing over pharmaceutical drugs, but mostly, his indifference at the introduction and misuse of Hepatitis C-laced fibrinogen concentrate, which eventually killed, among others, one of Shou's best friends. Horikiri and other forty-two people deemed responsible were ambushed by an analog amount of Akumetsu while driving their cars and, wounded, were transported via fake ambulance to an abandoned hospital, where they were put to death by means of that same infected fibrinogen they distributed. Horikiri himself died after three days of agony. ; :Another congressman. Former Construction Lobbyist Diet Member, who was in league with the local yakuza and had extensively drained local tax funds for private construction ventures. This congressman's head was decapitated by an Akumetsu at a wedding ceremony of a criminal boss. ; :Former Diet Party member who was about to start receiving a huge pension, is interviewed at a local sushi bar by a talk show host. His statements over not wanting to upset the pensions of his fellow congressmen OBs, while totally ignoring the plight of the local pension funds, made him a target for Akumetsu. He dies of a heart attack after seeing the severed heads of his fellow OBs paraded in front of him. ;Tomisaka :Chief of Pension Management. Guilty of embezzling and mismanaging pension funds of between fifty thousand and nine hundred thousand, which led to a shortage of three trillion in the total pension pool. To save his own life, he points out that the real criminal was Director Onodera of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Though Akumetsu murders the director, Tomisaka's life is still threatened in a standoff with the police. ;Onodera :Director of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The real cause of the failing pension system, according to Tomisaka. His office is blown apart, and he is forced into a suicidal dive with an Akumetsu to the pavement. ; :Former Board Chairman of the Pension Welfare Services. Used pension installments in failing investments. Despite losing around $24.5 billion, he still received a retirement package of over $1 million. He was shown being brutally dragged behind a motorcycle-riding Akumetsu on a racetrack, before they both violently crashed into a wall. ;Takatoshi Kanada :Former Board Chairman for the Unification of Japan's Social Insurance Agencies. Guilty of using the National and Welfare Ministry's Pension Funds to bolster the Congressman Pensions, yet he received a pension of over $3 million. Dies with an Akumetsu who had stuck several sticks of dynamite into the politician's mouth. ; :Congressman. Chief opposition to the People's Party Structural Reforms. His political misdeeds included crimes involving postal insurance and deposits. He and several other politicians were thrown out of the Prime Minister's Conference Room, along with an equal number of Akumetsu. All died when they hit the streets below. ; :Congressman and forerunner opposition to the People's Party Structural Reforms. Guilty of appropriating public funds for projects that do not benefit the general population. He was brutally pummeled to death by an Akumetsu wearing boxing gloves.

Life and family Florence Ross was born in Ulster on 6 December 1870. She was the youngest of three children of the Rev. William Steward Ross and Agnes Ross (n√©e Traill). Very soon after Ross's birth, the family moved to 3 Orwell Park, Rathgar, Dublin to live with her maternal grandmother, Mrs Annie Traill. Mrs Traill other daughter, the widow Mrs Kathleen Synge, lived next door at 4 Orwell Park. Ross and her cousin, John Millington Synge, grew up together and were consequently very close. They shared an interest in natural history and kept a joint notebook for their observations and drawings of animals. In his autobiography, Synge wrote about his infatuation with Ross, and that his childhood with her was the happiest time in his life. They did not remain as close in adulthood, but Ross and Synge's sister were the sole attendants at his Trinity College, Dublin graduation. In 1891 Ross lived with the Synges in D√∫n Laoghaire following the death of her mother, spending the summers with them at Castle Kevin, Annamoe, County Wicklow, passing the time drawing. She went to live with her brother in Tonga in 1895, where he was a doctor and she worked as his housekeeper. Over the next 11 years she visited New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina, returning to Ireland in 1906. Whilst in Ireland, Ross lived in Greystones, Clonlea, at various addresses in Dublin, and finally Blackrock. She ran a sketching club near Glendalough. Ross died in the Royal City of Dublin Hospital on 10 July 1949. Artistic work From 1906 onwards, Ross dedicated her life to painting, primarily landscapes in watercolours. As she spent a great deal of time in County Wicklow with her cousin Elizabeth Synge, a large portion of her work is from there. She also travelled and sketched in Antrim, Donegal, Dublin, Galway, and Kerry. Whilst on Great Blasket Island, she sketched the house Synge stayed in the \\"King's house\\". She exhibited with the Watercolour Society of Ireland from 1927 to 1948, showing around 90 paintings. From 1929 and 1938 she was exhibited by the Belfast Art Society and Ulster Academy of Arts, and 8 paintings with the Royal Hibernian Academy. Her works were mostly landscapes, many including buildings. Her work has not been the subject of much critical attention.

The protests began during the first week of June; becoming more organized and growing to hundreds of people on 8 June 2015. Since then, hundreds of thousands of Ecuadorians protested throughout Ecuador against President Correa and the controversial inheritance tax laws he introduced. The opposition and demonstrators protested stating that Correa wanted to follow \\"the same path as Venezuela‚Äôs government\\", creating a \\"criminal war of classes\\" while President Correa stated that the protests were aimed at destabilizing the government and such measures were for combatting inequality. Background Throughout his presidency, Correa has been a controversial figure. Correa describes himself as an advocate of \\"socialism of the 21st century\\", a term referring to a form of democratic socialism previously used by Venezuela's Hugo Ch√°vez. though he has also been described Correa as \\"a left-wing populist\\". Political science scholars George Philip and Francisco Panizza also claimed that like his allies Morales and Ch√°vez, Correa should be categorized as a populist, because he appealed \\"directly to the people against their countries' political and economic order, divided the social field into antagonistic camps and promised redistribution and recognition in a newly founded political order.\\" The Washington Post characterized Correa's ideological approach as having contradictions however, and compared him to other pink tide presidents such as Bolivia's Evo Morales and Venezuela's Hugo Ch√°vez. Though Correa, an economist, did not attack Ecuador's private sector like Ch√°vez and Ecuador's socioeconomic environment flourished with decreased poverty, he did follow Ch√°vez's example of filling the Supreme Court of Ecuador with his allies and attempted to silence critics. Such actions have resulted in Correa being accused of authoritarianism, nepotism, attacking dissidents and curtailing freedom of speech.Gobierno acent√∫a su intolerancia y autoritarismo Though Correa had brought stability to the poor who supported him, he combatted with other social groups such as the media, the Catholic Church, bankers and indigenous groups, saying that those who protested against him were part of \\"a wealthy oligarchy\\", a similar approach to what his ally Nicol√°s Maduro did to those who opposed him. Economic policies Following years of heavy revenues from high oil prices that Correa experienced during his eight years as president, Ecuador experienced a 50% reduction in oil revenues. The government then cut its 2015 fiscal budget by 4% and initiated controversial economic measures that affected most Ecuadorians; both the middle class and the poor. In March 2015 when constitutional changes were proposed to allow the re-election of the president and government officials indefinitely while other labor and land ownership rules were submitted, protests numbered in thousands occurred in Quito that were organized by indigenous communities, unions and students. In June 2015, when the government proposed bills to tax inheritances up to 77.5% and a 75% tax on real estate capital gains to counter loss in oil revenue, protests in Ecuador became widespread, with protesters demanding Correa out and compared actions by the government to that of the Venezuelan government. According to economists, the proposed policies would damage Ecuador's economy and population since 95% of businesses are family owned. Timeline of events Protests began on 8 June 2015 and continued after President Correa temporarily withdrew the proposed bills from legislation on 15 June. 8 June Near the headquarters of Correa's party, Alianza Pa√≠s, about 1,000 people, both opposition and pro-government demonstrated with 100 police on standby. 10 June Thousands of protesters wearing black in \\"mourning\\" demonstrated in the capital city of Quito for the second time in a week. Government supporters confronted the opposition protesters leading their own chants under an Alianza Pa√≠s banner. In other parts of the city, opposition and pro-government groups clashed. 24 June FUT protesting against Correa's policies on 24 June. Guillermo Lasso led a march to the National Assembly of Ecuador to demand the permanent withdrawal of the proposed taxes instead of a temporary shelving of the legislations. The Ecuadorian government stated that the leaders of the protests held the following day would be responsible for any \\"vandalism\\". Workers and trade unionists, mainly from the Frente Unitario de los Trabajadores (FUT), demonstrated in Quito denouncing Correa's policies, calling them \\"anti- popular\\" and were planning a national strike. Mes√≠as Tatamuez, leader of FUT stated that the protests were not related to those concerned about taxes and that the protests were not aimed at the \\"destabilization\\" of the Ecuadorian government as President Correa had stated. The workers protests involved the sweeping of streets to represent the \\"cleansing\\" of corruption from the Ecuadorian and the burning of an Alianza Pa√≠s flag. 25 June Guillermo Lasso leading a march in Guayaquil on 25 June. In Guayaquil, Correa's birthplace, Mayor Jaime Nebot invited demonstrators of all ages to participate with about 400,000 people, or about 20% of the city's population participating. The demonstrators gathered in light blue and white colors of Guayaquil's flag with Nebot stating that he was not protesting against Correa but the \\"totalitarian system\\" he said Correa wanted to \\"impose\\". Public buildings near the march were decorated by the Ecuadorian government with the Central Bank office building having a banner denouncing the accumulation of wealth and while Nebot was speaking, the volume of the building's loudspeakers that was sending pro-government messages was turned higher. In Quito, demonstrated congregated on Shyris Avenue and Mayor Mauricio Rodas denounced the new taxes that were promoted by President Correa. 2 July In Quito, Guayaquil, Cuenca and other cities, thousands protested against Correa days before Pope Francis' visit to the country. The Ecuadorian government held a countering rally at the president's palace. 9 July Hundreds protested outside of the Alianza Pa√≠s headquarters protesting against the taxes along with what they called autocratic and corrupt actions performed by the Ecuadorian government. The protesters waited for Pope Francis to complete his visit to Ecuador before protesting again. Public opinion According to Cedatos-Gallup International polls from six major cities in Ecuador between 10 and 11 June, 70% of Ecuadorians disapprove of the real estate tax and 72% disapprove of the inheritance tax. Cedatos also observed President Correa's popularity drop from around 60% in recent years to 42% in 2015. Controversies Internet While protesters were demonstrating in Quito and Guayaquil, some internet users were unable to connect to a network with explanations ranging from network over-saturation to the use of signal jammers by the Ecuadorian government. The use of peer-to-peer applications increased during the protests due to the network problems with Opposition Senator Andres Paez recommending the use of the FireChat app. The media also reported Denial- of-service attacks and the creation of fake media accounts to falsify reports. It has also been reported that the Ecuadorian government uses \\"troll centers\\" to attack their opposition.

Laurent wrote the novel over a period of 22 years. Reception The novel received the Prix Goncourt, with five votes against four in the sixth voting round. It was also the first choice for the Prix Renaudot, but the Renaudot can never go to the same book as the Goncourt, so the award went to the jury's second choice, Le Sac du palais d'√©t√© by Pierre-Jean R√©my. Although there are no political themes in Les B√™tises, the Goncourt jury's decision proved controversial within the leftist press due to Laurent's right-wing sympathies, and journalists complained that there were no working-class people in the novel.

When Druze live among people of other religions, they try to blend in, in order to protect their religion and their own safety. They can pray as Muslims, or as Christians, depending on where they are. This system is apparently changing in modern times, where more security has allowed Druze to be more open about their religious belonging. The Tanukhids inaugurated the Druze community in Syria when most of them accepted and adopted the new message that was being preached in the 11th century, due to their leaderships close ties with Fatimid caliph al-Hakim bi- Amr Allah. The Druze community in Syria played an important role in the formation of the modern state of Syria, and even though they are a minority they play an important role in the Syrian political scene. Druze warriors preparing to go to battle with Sultan al-Atrash, 1925 In Syria, most Druze live in the Jabal al-Druze, a rugged and mountainous region in the southwest of the country, which is more than 90 percent Druze inhabited; some 120 villages are exclusively so. Other notable communities live in the Harim Mountains, the Damascus suburb of Jaramana, and on the southeast slopes of Mount Hermon. A large Syrian Druze community historically lived in the Golan Heights, but following wars with Israel in 1967 and 1973, many of these Druze fled to other parts of Syria; most of those who remained live in a handful of villages in the disputed zone, while only a few live in the narrow remnant of Quneitra Governorate that is still under effective Syrian control. Druze celebrating their independence in 1925. The Druze always played a far more important role in Syrian politics than its comparatively small population would suggest. With a community of little more than 100,000 in 1949, or roughly three percent of the Syrian population, the Druze of Syria's southwestern mountains constituted a potent force in Syrian politics and played a leading role in the nationalist struggle against the French. Under the military leadership of Sultan al-Atrash, the Druze provided much of the military force behind the Great Syrian Revolt of 1925‚Äì27. In 1945, Amir Hasan al-Atrash, the paramount political leader of the Jabal Druze State, led the Druze military units in a successful revolt against the French, making the Jebel al-Druze the first and only region in Syria to liberate itself from French rule without British assistance. At independence the Druze, made confident by their successes, expected that Damascus would reward them for their many sacrifices on the battlefield. They demanded to keep their autonomous administration and many political privileges accorded them by the French and sought generous economic assistance from the newly independent government. Druze leaders meeting in Jabal al-Druze, Syria, 1926 When a local paper in 1945 reported that President Shukri al-Quwatli (1943‚Äì49) had called the Druzes a \\"dangerous minority\\", Sultan Pasha al-Atrash flew into a rage and demanded a public retraction. If it were not forthcoming, he announced, the Druzes would indeed become \\"dangerous\\" and a force of 4,000 Druze warriors would \\"occupy the city of Damascus.\\" Quwwatli could not dismiss Sultan Pasha's threat. The military balance of power in Syria was tilted in favor of the Druzes, at least until the military build up during the 1948 War in Palestine. One advisor to the Syrian Defense Department warned in 1946 that the Syrian army was \\"useless\\", and that the Druzes could \\"take Damascus and capture the present leaders in a breeze.\\" During the four years of Adib Shishakli's rule in Syria (December 1949 to February 1954) (on 25 August 1952: Shishakli created the Arab Liberation Movement (ALM), a progressive party with pan- Arabist and socialist views), the Druze community was subjected to a heavy attack by the Syrian government. Shishakli believed that among his many opponents in Syria, the Druzes were the most potentially dangerous, and he was determined to crush them. He frequently proclaimed: \\"My enemies are like a serpent: the head is the Jebel al-Druze, the stomach Homs, and the tail Aleppo. If I crush the head the serpent will die.\\" Shishakli dispatched 10,000 regular troops to occupy the Jebel al-Druze. Several towns were bombarded with heavy weapons, killing scores of civilians and destroying many houses. According to Druze accounts, Shishakli encouraged neighboring bedouin tribes to plunder the defenseless population and allowed his own troops to run amok. Shishakli launched a campaign to defame the Druzes for their religion and politics. He accused the entire community of treason, at times claiming they were agents of the British and Hashemites, at others that they were fighting for Israel against the Arabs. He even produced a cache of Israeli weapons allegedly discovered in the Jabal. Even more painful for the Druze community was his publication of \\"falsified Druze religious texts\\" and false testimonials ascribed to leading Druze sheikhs designed to stir up sectarian hatred. This propaganda also was broadcast in the Arab world, mainly Egypt. Shishakli was assassinated in Brazil on 27 September 1964 by a Druze seeking revenge for Shishakli's bombardment of the Jebel al-Druze. Maqam al-Masih (Jesus) in As-Suwayda Governorate. He forcibly integrated minorities into the national Syrian social structure; his \\"Syrianization\\" of Alawi and Druze territories had to be accomplished in part using violence. To this end, al- Shishakli encouraged the stigmatization of minorities. He saw minority demands as tantamount to treason. His increasingly chauvinistic notions of Arab nationalism were predicated on the denial that \\"minorities\\" existed in Syria. After the Shishakli's military campaign, the Druze community lost a lot of its political influence, but many Druze military officers played an important role when it comes to the Ba'ath government currently ruling Syria. In 1967, a community of Druze in the Golan Heights came under Israeli control, today about 20,000 strong. The Qalb Loze massacre was a reported massacre of 20-24 Syrian Druze on 10 June 2015 in the village of Qalb Loze in Syria's northwestern Idlib Governorate. On 25 July 2018, a group of Islamic State- affiliated attackers entered the Druze city of as-Suwayda and initiated a series of gunfights and suicide bombings on its streets killing at least 258 people, the vast majority of them civilians. See 2018 As-Suwayda attacks for further information. Demographics The Druze are concentrated in the rural, mountainous areas east and south of Damascus in the area known officially as Jabal al-Druze. The Syrian Druze are estimated to constitute 3.2% of Syria's population of approximately 23 million, which means they amount to between 700 and 736 thousand people. Before the Syrian civil war, its been estimated that around 700,000 Druze were living in Syria in 2010, or around 3% of the Syrian population. Around 337,5000 Druze lived in As-Suwayda Governorate (or 48.2% of total Syrian Druze), the only governorate in Syria that has a Druze majority (around 90%).Country Data Page on Syria While 250,000 Druze (or 35.7%) lived in Damascus and its outskirts (such as Jaramana, Sahnaya, and Jdeidat Artouz), and around 30,000 Druze lived in the east side of Mount Hermon, and around 25,000 Druze lived in 14 villages in Jabal al-Summaq in Idlib Governorate. There are many Syrian Druze also living abroad, particularly in Latin America, who have been living there for over the past hundred years.. In Venezuela alone there are approximately half a million Druze of Syrian origin. By one estimate made by Elisabe Granli from University of Oslo, around 1,920 Syrian Druze converted to Christianity, according to the same study Christian of Druze background (Druze converts to Christianity) still regard themselves as Druze, and they claims that there is no contradiction between being Druze and being Christian.

Kr√≥la Boles≈Çawa Chrobrego, 17 pu≈Ç) was a cavalry unit of the Polish Army in the Second Polish Republic. Formed in 1919, it was garrisoned in Leszno. The regiment, whose patron was King Boleslaw Chrobry (since May 6, 1939), fought in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War and the 1939 Invasion of Poland, as part of Wielkopolska Cavalry Brigade. Wielkopolska BK w 1938  Beginnings  The 3rd Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment, as it was called at first, was formed in late 1918 in Gniezno (Gnesen), where local Poles, following the example set by Pozna≈Ñ, decided to take control of the town, and push out Prussian authorities. At that time Gniezno was a large garrison of the Imperial German Army, with 49th Infantry Regiment and 12th Dragoon Regiment stationed here. Following a quick action, the Poles captured the barracks, and disarmed the soldiers, who were then loaded on trains and headed back to their homes. In early January 1919, Colonel Kazimierz Grudzielski, local commandant of Polish forces, ordered Colonel Edward Grabski to form a cavalry unit. On January 6, first volunteers were accepted, and after four days, a cavalry squadron was created. The uhlans took part in the Greater Poland Uprising, fighting near Szubin and ≈ªnin. On February 9 in Gniezno, oath of the new unit took place, with General Jozef Dowbor-Musnicki attending the ceremony. By early March, additional squadrons had been formed, and the regiment was completed by March 20, 1919. Most of officers had served either in the German Army, or Polish I Corps in Russia, while regular soldiers were local peasants and workers, equipped mostly with captured German weapons. By August 1919, the regiment had 22 officers and 789 soldiers, with almost 800 horses. In autumn 1919, the unit was sent to the newly created Polish Corridor, to return to Gniezno in early February 1920.  Polish ‚Äì Soviet War  In mid-February 1920, the regiment was loaded on a train, and was transported to Wilno, where its name was changed into the 17th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment. On March 12, Colonel Witold Zychlinski was named its commandant, and after a two-week training, the unit was transported to the frontline along the Berezina river. In mid-April 1920, it was transported to the Ukraine, to support Polish forces in the Kiev Offensive (1920). It fought with distinction, capturing the town of Malyn. On May 7, 1920, mounted patrols of the regiment entered Kiev. To commemorate this event, May 7 was named as regimental holiday. For the remaining part of May and in early June, the regiment patrolled the Dniepr river line, but after Soviet counteroffensive it was forced to retreat, together with whole VII Cavalry Brigade. After heavy fighting during the June 1920 retreat, the regiment lost up to 80% of its strength. By early July, it had only 109 soldiers and 2 machine guns. Transported by rail to Kowel (July 19), it was allowed to rest, and reinforced with 500 men. On August 3, after capturing Radziwi≈Ç≈Çow, the regiment was attacked by much stronger Soviet forces, who decimated the unit. After losing 40% of soldiers and 50% of horses, the 17th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment was on September 10 loaded on a train in Chodorow, to be transported back to Gniezno.  Second Polish Republic  After the return to the hometown, the command of the regiment was taken over by Colonel Erazm Stablewski, who reorganized the unit. Older soldiers were released, new uniforms were accepted, and in 1922, the regiment was moved to its new, peacetime garrison, located in Leszno, close to the German border. At Leszno, the regiment was set in former Prussian barracks. The town was at that time a large garrison of the Polish Army, as the 55th Infantry Regiment was also stationed there. In the 1930s, some 300 conscripts joined the regiment, with half of them coming from Greater Poland, and the remaining part from central Poland and Lesser Poland. During the May Coup in 1926, the regiment was ordered to come to aid the government of President Stanislaw Wojciechowski, and, together with whole VII Cavalry Brigade, was transported by rail to Mszczonow near Warsaw. It did not take part in the street fighting in the Polish capital, and soon returned to Leszno. In late September 1938, the regiment became part of the so-called Independent Operational Group Silesia, and participated in the capture of the region of Zaolzie.  1939 September Campaign  On August 24, 1939, the regiment was mobilized, as part of Wielkopolska Cavalry Brigade (General Roman Abraham). Its task was to protect southwestern corner of Greater Poland. Following the oath and a parade in a field by Leszno, the regiment with its 1160 soldiers and 40 officers marched off to its positions near the border. On September 1, 1939, at app. 8 a.m., the Germans attacked Polish uhlans stationed in Rydzyna, capturing the town. When reinforcements arrived later that day, the Poles managed to push out the enemy before nightfall. On September 2, following the order of General Abraham, the 55th Infantry Regiment carried out the Raid on Fraustadt, while uhlans of the 17th Regiment also entered German territory. Since general situation of Poland worsened, the retreat of Pozna≈Ñ Army was ordered on September 4. The regiment marched towards Konin, Turek and Kutno, in the general direction of Warsaw. All units of the army were covered in the south by the cavalry regiments, including the 17th Regiment. The Greater Poland uhlans were ordered to cross the Bzura river near the village of Sobota, and then to capture G≈Çowno. First line battalions of the regiment clashed with advancing Germans. The enemy retreated, and the Poles advanced across the Bzura, towards the village of Walewice. Polish attack against German 26th Infantry Regiment (30th Infantry Division) began at 5 a.m., on September 10. After a fierce, hand-to hand battle, the Germans again retreated. Polish losses amounted to 64 KIA, while the enemy lost around 100 KIA. For the whole day of September 10, 1939, heavy fighting continued around the town of G≈Çowno. On the next day, General Abraham decided to throw all forces available to him, in order to capture G≈Çowno. His plan failed, as the Germans were the first to attack, surprising the Poles, who retreated behind the Bzura. On September 15, the so-called Operational Group of Cavalry was formed, out of the elements of Wielkopolska Cavalry Brigade and Podolska Cavalry Brigade. Its task was to open the road towards Warsaw, across the Kampinos Forest. Heavy fighting continued until September 18, when the regiment reached Palmiry. After a short rest, however, the uhlans were attacked again by German tanks. The Battle of Sierak√≥w, as it was unofficially called, was one of the last victories of the Greater Poland Uhlans. During the September Campaign, the regiment lost 49 officers and 149 soldiers.

After David's deposition and death in exile in 1795, Ana tried to secure succession for her son Constantine during the reign of Solomon II, who had supplanted her husband. In her efforts, Ana relied on the Russian Empire, which eventually annexed Imereti in 1810. Ana spent the rest of her life in Russia, where she was known as tsaritsa Anna Matveyevna Imeretinskaya ().  Early life and marriage  Ana was born into the Orbeliani, one of the leading princely houses (tavadi) of the Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti (eastern Georgia). Her father was Prince Mamuka Orbeliani, a sisterly nephew of Heraclius II, king of Kartli and Kakheti. Her mother came of the house of Kvenipneveli, hereditary Dukes of the Ksani. After her father's death in 1770 Ana and her brothers were reared at the court of Heraclius in Tbilisi. Around 1781, Ana was married off to the Imeretian prince David, who had found shelter in Tbilisi after being part of a plot against his cousin, Solomon I of Imereti. Later, David returned to Imereti, bringing his wife with him. He seized the throne of Imereti in a power struggle in 1784, but was eventually toppled down by Solomon II, Heraclius II's grandson. David went in exile, giving Solomon his wife Ana and his heir Constantine as hostages.  Misfortunes  Following David's last futile attempt at coming back and his death in exile in 1795, Constantine was incarcerated by Solomon, while Ana was subjected to continuous harassment. She was still able to rebury her husband's remains from Akhaltsikhe to a familial burial ground at the Jruchi cathedral. Ana applied for protection to Heraclius, who granted her a hereditary estate in the Khepiniskhevi valley, at the border with Imereti, in 1798. After the death of Heraclius in 1798, Ana's vicissitudes continued. Prince Gogia Abashidze encroached on her lands, while Solomon II pressured her to move to Kutaisi. To this end, he sent troops to Ana's estate in March 1802. The queen's men resisted, giving her a means to escape, through forests, to Surami, where she was rescued by the Russian troops under Captain Bartyenyev. She repaired to St. Petersburg to solicit the help of Tsar Alexander I of Russia to secure the release of her son and then to guarantee him succession to the childless king Solomon.  In Russia  Under the Russian pressure, Solomon finally released Constantine in 1803 and, as part of his agreement with Russia, made the young prince his heir apparent in 1804. The Russian state confirmed this arrangement and, further, allowed Ana to retain the title of Queen (tsaritsa) for her lifetime on 12 September 1804. She had also been decorated with the Order of Saint Catherine, Great Cross. But the mother and the son now faced relocation to Russia proper envisaged by the Tsar. That same year, Constantine protested and escaped to Imereti, where he reconciled with Solomon and remained loyal to him until the Russian army finally conquered Imereti in March 1810. The Russians were suspicious of Ana's involvement in Constantine's defection. On 28 May 1809, she had to agree to relocate for resettlement from Tiflis to St. Petersburg, where she lived, on a modest state pension, with her daughter-in-law and grandson. She maintained contacts with the local Georgian men of culture and had several manuscripts copied. Ana vainly sought to reclaim her and Constantine‚Äôs estates in Imereti or be monetarily compensated for her loss and to have the right to return to Imereti. In 1811, she organized a small chapel of the Nativity of Jesus in a rented house near St. Vladimir's Cathedral, which functioned until after her death. She died in Moscow in 1832 and was buried at the Donskoy Monastery.

It was subsequently ported to a variety of contemporary systems by differing companies. The game is centered around a series of road races throughout California that the player must win to advance to higher-difficulty races, while using a combination of fisticuffs and blunt weaponry to hinder the other racers. Road Rash was one of the first games conceived by EA following the company's decision to begin developing games internally. The game's programmers Dan Geisler and Carl Mey were hired by EA to create a banked road effect for an NES title named Mario Andretti Racing. When the NES proved incapable of rendering the desired effect, focus shifted to a motorcycle racing game for the more powerful Sega Genesis. The game includes combat elements that were inspired by the violent behavior of Grand Prix motorcyclists during races, and the resulting uncertainty surrounding the game's genre created conflict between EA's development team and management. Road Rash was released to critical and commercial success, and was EA's most profitable title to date. The original version for the Sega Genesis was particularly acclaimed for its violent and aggressive gameplay and the convincing sense of speed in its graphics. The game is the debut installment of the Road Rash series, and was followed by a number of sequels made for various consoles. Gameplay An example of gameplay in the Genesis version of Road Rash. Road Rash puts the player in control of a motorcycle racer who must finish in fourth-place or higher among fourteen other racers in a series of five road races to advance throughout the game's five levels.Road Rash (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 13 The game is primarily single-player, but allows for two players to play intermittently against each other.Road Rash (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 12‚Äì13 The game's races take place in a number of Californian locales, including San Francisco, the Sierra Nevada, Napa Valley and the Pacific Coast Highway.Road Rash (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 17‚Äì18 During a race, the player can brake, accelerate, and attack neighboring racers. The player character will punch at the nearest racer with a default input, while holding a directional button during the input will result in either a backhand or a kick. Some opponents wield clubs, which can be taken and used by the player if the enemy racer is attacked as they are holding the club out to strike.Road Rash (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 10‚Äì12 The player racer can be ejected from their bike if they crash into an obstacle (such as cows, deer, cars and treesRoad Rash (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 18‚Äì19) or if they run out of stamina (shown in the bottom-left corner of the screen) due to fights with other racers.Road Rash (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 9‚Äì10 In this event, the racer will automatically run back toward their bike, though the player can alter their course and avoid incoming traffic with the directional buttons, or stand still by holding the brake input button. Opponents will likewise be ejected from their bike if their own stamina is depleted; the stamina of the nearest racer is visible within the bottom-right corner of the screen. The player character begins the game with $1,000.Road Rash (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 19‚Äì20 When the player wins a race, a cash prize is added to the player's balance. Between races, the player can access a bike shop and view several bikes of differing weights, speeds and steering capabilities, and the player can potentially purchase a new bike with the money they have accumulated.Road Rash (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 16‚Äì17 The player will receive a password at the end of a successful race, which can be entered at a password entry screen in a subsequent session to maintain the player's progress;Road Rash (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 14‚Äì15 When the player wins a race on all five of the game's tracks, they will advance to the next level. The player wins the game if they win a race on each track in all five levels. The player's bike has its own \\"damage meter\\" between the player's and opponents' stamina meters, which decreases every time the player suffers a crash. If the meter fully depletes, the bike will be wrecked, the player's participation in the current race will end, and a repair bill must be paid. Motorcycle cops also make sporadic appearances throughout the game's tracks. If the player crashes within the vicinity of a cop, the cop will end their participation in the current race by apprehending them and charging them a fine. If the player lacks the funds to cover either a repair bill or a fine, the game will end prematurely.  Development and release   Conception and early development  Road Rash was one of the first titles conceived by EA after they made the decision to begin developing video games in-house; until that point, EA had previously outsourced video game development to external studios, and were primarily focused on PC games due to the effects of the video game crash of 1983. In its tentative steps back into the console market, EA focused on genres that were determined to be strategic, namely sports and racing titles. Preliminary development began on an NES title named Mario Andretti Racing, and programmer Dan Geisler was hired by the company at this time. Technical director Carl Mey, who had just been laid off from Epyx following its bankruptcy, was also hired by EA and was given his first major project of creating a \\"banked road\\" effect for the game. Mey soon realized that while the NES was capable of road- scaling effects, banking would be beyond the console's ability. Producer and designer Randy Breen, who was previously involved with Indianapolis 500: The Simulation, was influenced by the difficulty and tedium of that title to create a racing game with more accessibility and entertainment value. Because Andretti was set to follow a similar formula to Indianapolis 500, Geisler, Breen, May and co-designer Walter Stein began a brainstorming session for a different type of racing game that would not necessarily adhere to realism. After Mey and Geisler rejected QuadRunners as potential racing vehicles due to Andretti's dirt track setting, Breen suggested motorcycles. Breen recounted, \\"I'd been into motorcycles for a long time, and we quickly realized bikes gave us lots of technical advantages. For instance, we could put more bikes than cars onscreen at once, and the bikers were more visible than car drivers, so they could be more expressive.\\" The game's title originated from Breen reminiscing to the group about riding his own bike on Mulholland Drive to meet with friends and thinking to himself \\"Man, if you wiped out here, you'd get some serious road rash\\". Geisler suggested the title Road Rash on Mulholland Drive, and Breen used the name to pitch the concept to EA. The title was eventually shortened to Road Rash, and development moved from the NES to the recently introduced Sega Genesis, which was powerful enough to generate the desired road effects. Development for Road Rash was moved to the Sega Genesis (pictured) after preliminary development for Mario Andretti Racing on the NES proved impractical. Before joining EA, Geisler had worked on Spectrum HoloByte's racing game Vette!; Geisler's coding for this title provided the framework for Road Rash, particularly its algorithm for estimating road curvature. Geisler claimed that the Genesis's memory capacity could have allowed him to create 802 miles of unique roads, and that he could have accurately mapped out the entire coast of California. The road effect for Road Rash took Geisler about six months to create, comprising a large portion of the game's early development. 3D-rendering technology for the game was adapted from the Genesis version of Blockout, which was in development at the same time. Lead artist Arthur Koch was brought onto the development team after the project was well underway, and he was tasked with training the other artists on using EA's in-house tools and conforming to the Genesis's 64-color palette, which Koch stated \\"was hard for a lot of artists to grasp\\". Several months into development, EA made the decision to promote Road Rash at the 1990 Consumer Electronics Show as a show of support for the Sega Genesis. This initial demonstration proved unsatisfactory; as Breen recalled, \\"We struggled to maintain a reasonable frame rate and the animations weren't effective.\\" Mey also had concerns with \\"the very tame, almost Disney-like view of the AMA, and Randy's desire to make it a 'go anywhere'-style game\\". He remarked that the development team would refer to the game as \\"Randy's Sunday Ride\\" behind his back, and that \\"we all knew Road Rash needed more balls to sell than a simulation of someone following the speed limit.\\" Following the show, the game needed to be re-pitched twice to avoid cancellation, and the team was given an additional six months to improve the game.  Revamp and release  Mey requested to EA producer Richard Hilleman that he be given creative control over the gameplay on the grounds that he \\"wanted to make the game kick ass\\", to which Hilleman agreed. Over the following months, Geisler and Stein improved the game's performance, and Connie Braat refined the animation. To increase the player's sense of immersion, the rival racers were given individual names and characters, and would deliver banter in between races. The cops who pursue the player and arrest them if they crash were added to the game to create tension. To obtain reference material, Koch went to a local police department and convinced a motorcycle cop to pose for photographs. The wipe-out animations were brought about by Koch's previous work on John Madden Football and Lakers versus Celtics and the NBA Playoffs; on the subject, Koch said \\"I was disappointed with the tackles and the falls and the fouls. I thought they could be a lot more dynamic. So I suggested that we devote more frames of animation to the crashes.\\" Breen cited additional influence from Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner and \\"other cartoons where the villain gets beat up\\", adding that \\"Even though it set you back, it was still fun to watch.\\" The combat element of the game was inspired by the behavior of Grand Prix motorcyclists, who Breen noticed would sometimes shove and kick each other during races. Other influences on this aspect include the biker gang action scenes in Akira and the tire pump scene in Breaking Away. While working on the game's combat system, Mey and Geisler set a \\"no projectiles\\" rule, as such elements were an major issue in game engines that ran based on the frame rate. The introduction of fighting elements served to muddy the game's genre classification among EA's management, as they primarily specialized in simulation games and were uncertain how to market a title that was simultaneously a fighting and a racing game. Geisler named Hang-On as an influence in the game's direction, saying that \\"Hang-On before us was a game I liked, but I thought it was limited ‚Äì no hills, no punching, no kicking. I respect Yu Suzuki, but I had it in my mind that this was going to make Hang-On obsolete. And I think we kind of accomplished that.\\" Due to the game's violent content, EA was unable to secure official licenses from existing manufacturers, and so created soundalike brands in their place; \\"Panda\\", \\"Shuriken\\", \\"Kamikaze\\" and \\"Diablo\\" are respectively derived from Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Ducati. The game's roads were modeled by a crew led by and made use of B√©zier curves. Breen claimed that the final road effect made some players vomit from motion sickness, to which he yelled out \\"Great. I've finally made a game that makes people puke!\\" Simultaneous multiplayer, which would become a common feature of subsequent Road Rash titles, was not yet possible due to the CPU power consumed by the game's road effect. The game's music was composed by Rob Hubbard.Road Rash (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 24 Road Rash was Hubbard's second motorcycle-based game following the 1985 Mastertronic title Action Biker. The development of Road Rash spanned a total of approximately 21 months. Breen took advantage of EA's policy of not crediting producers on box art by removing Mey's name and inserting his own. This incident led to EA abolishing the practice of box-printed credits altogether. Mey would be presented with EA's in-house \\"Fireman of the Year\\" award, an accolade given to employees with the most impact on troubled projects. The Genesis version was publicly announced on March 1991 and released in North America in September 1991. The Amiga version was developed by Peakstar Software, featured music composed by Jason A.S. Whitely,Road Rash (Amiga) opening credits and was released on December 1992. Road Rash was converted for the Game Gear and Master System by Gary Priest of Probe Software, with music adapted by Greg Michael.Road Rash (Game Gear/Master System) opening credits These versions were released in March 1994. The Game Boy version was published by Ocean Software and released in June 1994. In April 1996, THQ announced that it would publish a Super NES version of Road Rash for a Christmas 1996 release that ultimately did not materialize. The Genesis version of Road Rash, along with its immediate sequels II and 3, was included in the PlayStation Portable compilation title EA Replay in 2006.  Reception  The Genesis version of Road Rash was met with critical acclaim. KITS disc jockey Big Rick Stuart, writing for GamePro, gave the game a perfect score and called it \\"an instantly addictive motorcycle 16-bit game with a somewhat sick twist thrown in\\". MegaTech magazine said \\"Lots of races, lots of bikes, and plenty of thrills 'n' spills make this the best racer on the Megadrive!\\" Paul Glancey and Tim Boone of Computer and Video Games respectively described the game as a \\"beat 'em up on motorbikes\\" and \\"Super Hang-On with fists and clubs thrown in\\"; both reviewers noted that the graphics were convincing in their creation of the illusion of speed in spite of the fairly simple visuals, and Glancey added that the aggressive nature of the gameplay \\"broadens the enjoyment you get from Road Rash a great deal and makes you wonder why no-one thought of it before.\\" Mark Bruton of Mega Zone said that the game's \\"vividly realistic\\" settings were complimented by the \\"excellently detailed\\" graphics and multi-level parallax scrolling, and was amused by the biker vocalizations, which were \\"very funny in a sick way\\". Richard Leadbetter and Julian Rignall of Mean Machines both praised the convincing three-dimensional effect of the graphics, with Leadbetter additionally commending the \\"brilliant\\" sound effects and Hubbard's \\"great\\" music. Road Rash was the 9th best-selling Genesis title in the United Kingdom in February 1992. In the United States, Road Rash was the third highest- renting Genesis title at Blockbuster Video in April 1992, and the ninth highest-renting in the following month. At the time of its release, Road Rash became EA's most profitable title. Mega placed the game at #8 on their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.Mega magazine issue 1, page 76, Future Publishing, Oct 1992 Game Informer ranked it as the 88th best game ever made in their 100th issue in 2001. The staff praised its more violent take on motorcycle video games. The Amiga release of Road Rash was received positively. Neil Jackson of Amiga Format found the violent gameplay to be \\"just all-out thrash fun\\" that would \\"annoy everyone from the road safety crew to the Mary Whitehouse brigade\\", but added that the game \\"sounds like a kazoo [and] looks like a moped on an 8-bit\\". CU Amiga described the game as an \\"immensely playable\\" and \\"nicely violent\\" alternative to normal racing games, but noted that the Amiga version runs slower than the Genesis version and \\"doesn't deliver the feeling of charging down a road at 120mph.\\" Road Rash was the fourth-highest selling Amiga title in the United Kingdom in its debut month, and remained among the top-30 best-sellers for five more months. The Game Gear/Master System version also received positive reviews. Manny LaMancha of GamePro commended the simple controls, clean and clear graphics, ample audio and high challenge. Radion Automatic and Lucy Hickman of Mean Machines Sega praised the fast and easy-to-control gameplay, large sprites, and detailed and smooth graphics, though Hickman noted the absence of a simultaneous two-player mode as a drawback. Road Rash was the sixth highest- selling Game Gear title at Babbage's in its first month, and stayed within the top ten highest-selling Game Gear titles for the next five months. Legacy Road Rash was followed by two sequels on the Genesis, Road Rash II and Road Rash 3, as well as further spinoffs developed for later platforms such as the PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance. The Genesis titles achieved similar critical and commercial success to their predecessor, while the installments made for later consoles were met with mixed receptions and failed to recreate the success of the Genesis versions. EA attempted to capitalize on Road Rashs success by repurposing its game engine and mix of combat and racing for the 1994 inline skating title Skitchin. Road Rash: Jailbreak, the last official installment of the series, was released in 2000. A spiritual successor to the Road Rash series, Road Redemption, was developed by Ian Fisch and released in 2017.

In 1894, the grant of the decoration was extended to commissioned officers of Volunteer Forces throughout the British Empire. A separate new decoration was instituted, the Volunteer Officers' Decoration for India and the Colonies, post-nominal letters VD. Awarding of this decoration was discontinued in 1899, when it was superseded by the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration and later, in respect of India, by the Indian Volunteer Forces Officers' Decoration.North East Medals - The Volunteer Officers' Decoration (Accessed 28 June 2015) Origin The Volunteer Officers' Decoration, colloquially known as the Volunteer Decoration, was instituted by Queen Victoria's Royal Warrant on 25 July 1892. The decoration could be awarded to efficient and thoroughly capable officers of proven capacity for long and meritorious service in the part-time Volunteer Force of the United Kingdom. The qualifying period of service was twenty years. Institution On 24 May 1894, the grant of the Volunteer Officers' Decoration was extended by Queen Victoria's Royal Warrant to commissioned officers of Volunteer Forces throughout the British Empire, defined as being India, the Dominion of Canada, the Crown Colonies and the Crown Dependencies. A separate new decoration was instituted, the Volunteer Officers' Decoration for India and the Colonies. This decoration was similar in design to the Volunteer Officers' Decoration, but bore the Royal Cypher \\"VRI\\" (Victoria Regina Imperatrix) instead of \\"VR\\" (Victoria Regina).South African Medal Website ‚Äì Colonial Military Forces (Accessed 6 May 2015) Even so, some Crown Dependencies continued to award the Volunteer Officers' Decoration instead of the Colonial version, until the Efficiency Decoration was instituted in September 1930. Award criteria The qualifying period of service was also twenty years, except in India where it was eighteen years. Service in the Volunteer Forces of any portion of the Empire was reckoned as part of the qualifying service required for this Decoration, while half of any previous service in the Permanent Forces of the Empire also counted towards qualification. The award did not confer any individual precedence, but entitled the recipient to use the post-nominal letters VD. The power of conferring the decoration and of revoking the award was exercised on behalf of the Queen by the Governor-General of India, the Governor-General of the Dominion of Canada or the Governors of the respective Colonies or Dependencies. The names of officers of the Empire who were awarded the decoration, or whose award was revoked, were published in the Official Gazettes of India or of the relevant Crown Colony or Dependency instead of in the London Gazette. Order of wear In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Volunteer Officers' Decoration for India and the Colonies takes precedence after the Volunteer Long Service Medal and before the Volunteer Long Service Medal for India and the Colonies. South Africa With effect from 6 April 1952, when a new South African set of decorations and medals was instituted to replace the British awards used to date, the older British decorations and medals which were applicable to South Africa continued to be worn in the same order of precedence but, with the exception of the Victoria Cross, took precedence after all South African decorations and medals awarded to South Africans on or after that date. Of the official British medals which were applicable to South Africans, the Volunteer Officers' Decoration for India and the Colonies takes precedence as shown.Government Notice no. 1982 of 1 October 1954 - Order of Precedence of Orders, Decorations and Medals, published in the Government Gazette of 1 October 1954.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (South Africa) Volunteer Officers' Decoration for India and the Colonies Volunteer Long Service Medal for India and the Colonies * Preceded by the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (South Africa). * Succeeded by the Volunteer Long Service Medal for India and the Colonies. Description The decoration is an oval skeletal design and was struck in silver, with parts of the obverse in silver-gilt. It is high and wide, with a ring suspender formed of silver wire. ; Obverse: The obverse is an oak leaf wreath in silver, tied with gold, with the royal cypher \\"VRI\\" below the royal crown, both in gold, in the centre. ; Reverse: The reverse is plain, with the hallmarks impressed at the bottom. The decoration was awarded unnamed, but was frequently unofficially engraved in various styles. ; Ribbon: The ribbon is the same as that of the Volunteer Officers' Decoration, dark green and wide. It is suspended from a silver bar-brooch, decorated with an oak leaf pattern. Discontinuation In 1899, except in respect of the Indian Empire where it would later be superseded by the Indian Volunteer Forces Officers' Decoration, the Volunteer Officers' Decoration for India and the Colonies was superseded by the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration, instituted by Royal Warrant on 18 May 1899 and amended by further Warrants on 3 August 1902 and 9 June 1921.

Ancient Egyptian anatomical studies is an article about the history of anatomy within ancient Egypt. Overview From a period spanning the time beginning at about 3100 B.C. to the finish of the 2nd century A.D., anatomical studies were fore-most within the ancient Egyptian nation, than within other parts of the world, according to archaeological evidence. People of the ancient Egyptian civilization initiated an independent practice of anatomical study, which represented the first movement within humanity toward the development of an understanding of anatomy; Egypt is where the study of anatomy historically first developed. People belonging to the Egyptian nation were the first to make a written record of anatomical studies.Ancient Civilizations Toothil school, Nottingham [Retrieved 2015-06-28] Manetho is thought to have recorded the work of an early anatomist. In his work History of Egypt Manetho states the pharaoh Djer was an anatomist, although a source considers the likelihood of the pharaoh being an anatomist to be low. Djer is stated to have been the first to have made a written work on the study of anatomy, entitled Practical Medicine and Anatomical Book, which is known of, but not extant, although this attribution may represent an honorific observance indicating the book was written within the reign of the pharaoh, within which the book is known to have been written.J.F.

She is a typical young girl who has been spoiled by her parents, mostly her mom (Saba Faisal). She gets anything she asks for and loves to shop! Despite being wealthy, she and her family shift to a house on rent. Hania, due to her bubbly nature, quickly becomes friends with a girl Aina (Madiha Zaidi) who's her neighbor. She visits Aina's house very often and when she comes across her brother Hamza (Adnan Siddiqui) she starts having feelings for him. Hania starts to become very serious about Hamza but he on the other hand doesn't seem to even take notice of her. Basically they are two opposites. Hamza is a serious, practical, and mature guy while Hania isn't. Hania tells her mom how much she's in love with Hamza and wants to marry him. Hania's mother takes the word materialism to a whole new level! Since Hamza and his family are not financially as sound, she keeps forcing her to not make the \\"mistake\\" of marrying him. \\"Aap ke sar pe tou ishq ka bhoot sawaar hai. Aap bohat barri ghalati kar rahi hain Haniaa!!\\" says her mom. Hania doesn't change her mind and married to him. Hania has been treated like a princess all her life and she expects the same treatment from Hamza and his family too. But Hamza has a lot of responsibilities of his family already and doesn't have the resources to treat Hania that way, but promises to keep her happy despite that too. But little does he know, just happiness is not what Hania's mom wants for her. Hania at this point argues with her mom that she's happy with Hamza, but her mom keeps forcing her that he hasn't given her enough \\"gold jewelry\\" or money so she can't be happy. To cut a very long story short, Hania's mom was never in favor of Hamza becoming her son in law so she goes to every extent to ruin Hania's happiness. Hania also starts doubting Hamza's cousin Aaliya as she finds out that she used to like him a long time ago yet she had no intentions of creating problems for the two. Hania's mom however fills her brain with so many false accusations about Hamza and Aaliya that she eventually starts hating them. Her mom becomes so successful in her plan that she causes the two to get divorced. Hania was expecting at the time of their divorce so she threatens Hamza to kill the child but it was only a threat. After the divorce Hania and her family shift to another house to help Hania start a new life. She gets blessed with a baby girl whom she hides from Hamza, but later he finds out about it and files a case to take her custody, but fails. Hania's mom had always wanted Hania to marry Faisal who happens to be her bhabi's cousin. Of course, Faisal is rich. Hania starts working and ignores Emaan (her daughter). When Hamza finds out he tells Hania to either give proper time and care to Emaan or to hand her over to him forever and then go marry Faisal. Hania has yet to decide what option she's going to pick!http://www.hipinpakistan.com/news/1147794 Soundtrack The title song is written by Sabir Zafar, with composition by Sahir Ali Bagga.

He was a doctoral fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.Curriculum Vitae J. STEPHEN LANSING, 2014, at slansing.org. in 1976 and received his doctorate in Anthropology from University of Michigan in 1977. After graduation Lansing in 1977 began his professional career at the University of Southern California as Assistant Professor. He became Associate Professor in 1983 and Professor in Anthropology from 1990 to 1996. From 1987 to 1992 he also chaired the Department of Anthropology. From 1995 to 1998 he was Professor of Anthropology and Professor at the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan. In 1998 he moved to the University of Arizona, where he was appointed Professor of Anthropology, and from 2002 also Professor of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. From 2015 to 2019 he was Founding Director of the Complexity Institute and Professor in the Asian School of Environment at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

Precise management of irrigation by Balinese subaks  Research  In the 1980‚Äôs, Lansing and ecologist James Kremer showed that Balinese water temple networks can self-organize, and that over the centuries, water temple networks expanded to manage the ecology of rice terraces at the scale of whole watersheds. In 2012, Bali‚Äôs water temple networks were recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage. In 2017, Lansing and colleagues showed that the self-organization of the water temple networks is not an historical accident, but an emergent property of a self-governing system of environmental management. In 2019, the story of the water temple research (\\"Priests and Progammers\\") was the focus of an exhibition by a team of architects, artists and researchers from ETH Zurich at the Sharjah Architecture Triennial. Lansing's analysis of adaptive self-organized criticality is now being used to seek a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from Balinese rice terraces. As the pieces of the water temple story were falling into place, Lansing became interested in self-organizing processes elsewhere in the archipelago. In 2000 he began to work with Indonesian medical researchers, linguists and public health officials to study the co-evolution of social structure, language change and disease resistance on 17 islands in the Malay archipelago. Combining fine-grained linguistic, genetic and kinship information revealed historical patterns of gene expression, social interaction and language change on a scale of time and space that had not previously been observed. The story is told in Islands of Order: A Guide to Complexity Modeling for the Social Sciences (Princeton University Press 2019 and companion website https://www.islandsoforder.com). In May 2018 Lansing led a team that discovered a group of cave-dwelling hunter-gatherers in Indonesian Borneo, and a year later began working with the Leakey Foundation and the Nature Conservancy to help the Cave Punan preserve their forests. More than half of Borneo's forest cover is already gone, and at current rates of deforestation the remaining lowland forests (and with them a large share of the Earth's terrestrial biodiversity) will be lost well before the end of the century. Like the farmers of Bali, the Cave Punan manage their relationship to the natural environment by consensus. Lansing's current research explores how the dynamics of these centuries-old systems of adaptive governance may be relevant to the as-yet-unmanaged global commons.

She was among the designers for Stirling Cooper, working subsequently at Coopers and Quorum, before establishing the label Barnett and Brown with Sheridan Barnett. She continued to design under her own name, both high-end fashion and for the high-street, as part of a collaboration with Jeffrey Rogers. At the end of the 1980s, Brown became head of womenswear design at Marks & Spencer. She remained in this role for more than a decade. She also worked as a fashion academic, first at Central Saint Martins and later at the Royal College of Art, where she was appointed a senior fellow in 2011. Early life and career Sheilagh Brown was born in Kent and her father was a photographer for the Natural History Museum. She had her first foray into fashion working in a shoe shop in Rayners Lane. She attended Harrow Art School where, as she recalled in an interview for Very magazine, she learned many skills including running up a frock in a couple of hours to wear for the evening's clubbing in Soho. She knew the young Malcolm McLaren ‚Äì then Malcolm Edwards ‚Äì as well as Ronnie Wood. From art school, Brown won a place at the Royal College of Art ‚Äì hers was one of 12 places on the course; her peer group included Bill Gibb and her tutors included Janey Ironside. While still a student, Brown earned money creating fashion drawings for national publications, including The Times, The Observer, Petticoat and 19. One of the perks of this job, as described by Brown in Very magazine, was that the clothes would arrive on a Friday night and Brown and her friends would wear them to a party before she stayed up all night to sketch and then return them. Stirling Cooper Antony Price ‚Äì who was in the year above Brown ‚Äì introduced her to Jeff Cooper, co-founder of the Stirling Cooper label. She joined as a womenswear designer, succeeding Jane Whiteside, while Price was in charge of menswear. At this stage, this was among the hippest brands in London and with an extraordinary boutique in Wigmore Street described in colourful detail by The Times' fashion editor Prudence Glynn in 1969: \\"Ingress, or rather descent, is through the jaws of a dragon and you expect to find yourself in a salon with a digestive tract decor. In fact, once you have been swallowed by Geoffrey Vivas' smiling monster the style is Japanese bath house.\\" This was a place where rock stars, including Mick Jagger hung out. The shop was a testing ground for new ideas and was described by The Times journalist Anthony King-Deacon as effectively a couture house, the key differences being the ready-to-wear designs, the limited choice of sizes and the low prices. Turnaround on designs was rapid ‚Äì as little as two weeks ‚Äì and men's and women's clothes were made up in the same factory and in similar materials to reduce costs. Coopers and Quorum When the Stirling Cooper partnership split, Brown moved on with Jeff Cooper and Sheridan Barnett to found Coopers, a high-fashion brand located just off Savile Row. This had its own store, but also retailed through stores such as Miss Selfridge. Two years later, Brown and Barnett took over from Alice Pollock and Ossie Clark as head designers at Quorum. Describing the atmosphere, Brown has said: \\"It was every designer's dream job. It was insane, with Alice working on her collection, stark naked on hot days. Crazed models drifted into my studio and drank my cloudy paint water!\\" Barnett and Brown In 1976, Barnett and Brown set up in business together in Macklin Street, Covent Garden, in a space loaned rent free by Jeff Banks. Brown also set up a design studio co-op for graduate designers called Queen Street Studios, which was located above Blitz Club. Writing in 1977, Prudence Glynn singled out Barnett and Brown ‚Äì then producing their second collection under the Jazz label ‚Äì as: \\"designers whose recent collections bear traces of the eighteenth- century influence\\". Glynn said their collection had avoided descending into fancy dress and had: \\"attempted to convey a mood of elegance and luxury. The result is entirely original and illustrates the move towards rich fabrics and softness of colour and cut\\". The article featured designs by Brown, including a wraparound coat in mohair and jodhpurs with matching top with a ruff collar made of pink moire. Glynn included Brown and Barnett in a televised fashion show she organised at Castle Howard in November 1978 (this was shown on Yorkshire Television and later written up in The Times), including them as representative of: \\"a very specific look which is specially associated with young English fashion\\". Conceived as a showcase of British fashion talent, the programme also included designs by Norman Hartnell, Zandra Rhodes, Murray Arbeid, Janice Wainwright and Kaffe Fasset. Fashion lecturer and high- street ranges By 1980, Barnett and Brown had split, a casualty of the early 1980s recession. Speaking in 1983 about the business failure, Barnett said: \\"Even the New York orders were unreal. But we did not have the finance to produce the orders. We tried everywhere, but that was the start of the recession, that was when it was really starting to bite on the fashion industry\\". The duo both took teaching jobs at Central Saint Martins and then Barnett began designing under his own name for the Salvador label owned by Eric Hall. By 1983, he had picked up a Dress of the Year award. Sheilagh Brown stayed on as principal lecturer in fashion at Saint Martins. The college at this time was, as she described it, a \\"hothouse atmosphere\\", with a whole raft of students who would go on to influence fashion and popular culture, including John Galliano, John Flett, Stephen Jones, Darla Jane Gilroy, Sade and Chris Sullivan. She began a project with the fashion designer Jeffrey Rogers ‚Äì a key supplier of mass market fashion (usually under an eponymous label) to retailers such as Top Shop and Miss Selfridge. This gave students the opportunity to design garments for commercial production. This, as described by Rogers, was an abysmal failure, but he liked working with Brown and invited her to design for him. Brown's own label designs for Jeffrey Rogers proved so successful that she began designing for its more upmarket Portrait label as well. Brown noted that this was a very different way of working, not least because store buyers had more control over the overall styling and merchandising of garments once they arrived in store, adding: \\"The discipline of working within a strict budget is surprisingly exhilarating\\". Brown also maintained her own more upmarket label, with outfits costing upwards of ¬£200, but Brenda Polan said this was a bonus. \\"Jeffrey Rogers's masterstroke is that he has made the connection between designer and mass market less tenuous\\". In 1984, Brown's designs were exhibited at a British fashion event held at Olympia for international fashion buyers ‚Äì described as a \\"coming of age\\" for the fashion industry ‚Äì since all the ready-to-wear designers were under one roof and exhibited so that buyers and journalists could see their work. Others exhibiting included BodyMap, Wendy Dagworthy, Betty Jackson, Roland Klein and Sheridan Barnett. Marks & Spencer design role In 1988, (some sources say 1990), Brown became head of womenswear design at Marks & Spencer. Writing in The Guardian, Catherine Wilson said the credit for a turnaround in M&S; profits (at record levels in 1993) was with Brown, who had brought in a team of six designers and was using Betty Jackson and Paul Smith as consultants. Marks & Spencer picked up a British Fashion Award in 1995. Brown retired from the role in 2001. Fashion influence Brown taught many of the next generation of fashion designers during her tenure at Central Saint Martins and later at the Royal College of Art, where she was made a senior fellow in 2011. At Central Saint Martins, this included names such as John Galliano and John Flett, both of whom are credited with pioneering a new form of bias-cutting. At the RCA, this included names such as the milliner Philip Treacy ‚Äì Treacy mentioned her as one of his most influential teachers and said she helped him make the decision to become a milliner rather than a fashion designer. Brown's involvement in shaping high fashion's move from elite couture into edgy styles for mass manufacturing ‚Äì notably with Stirling Cooper ‚Äì was profiled in an interview for the Design Museum's 2009 exhibition Super Contemporary. Her eponymous designs with Sheridan Barnett are included within the archive of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

By 2008, ILC began receiving support from Beny Alagem, Leo David and Haim Saban. It held its first major event, \\"Live for Sderot\\", a celebrity gala with 1,800 attendees. The two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, both sent videos expressing their support for the event. The ILC held its first annual gala dinner in 2009, attended by hundreds of Israeli-Americans. In 2011, ILC began funding Sifriyat Pijama B-America, a Hebrew language version of PJ Library. PJ Library is a nonprofit which sends children's book to Jewish families. The program was cancelled in 2016. Sagi Balasha became ILC's first CEO in September 2011. ILC Care was launched in November. In April 2012, ILC launched the Celebrate Israel Festival to celebrate Israel's Independence Day. In 2013, the ILC rebranded as the Israeli-American Council. Funded by Miriam and Sheldon Adelson, the organization launched an expansion plan to create regional councils across the United States. By summer 2014, the IAC had a staff of 60 people, an annual budget of $17.5 million and six regional offices. By 2014, IAC Merkaz and IAC Shishi Israel were established, as were regional chapters in Boston, Florida, Las Vegas, and New York. In October 2014, Adam Milstein became the Chairman of the IAC, and Shoham Nicolet returned as the organization's CEO. IAC has established several regional chapters since 2015. Those years also saw the launch of IAC Manhigut, IAC Act, and IAC Eitanim. By the end of 2018, IAC has 20 regional offices and more than 58 active communities.

Israeli- American National Conference In 2014, IAC began hosting annual national conferences, featuring American and Israeli politicians and business leaders. The conference has grown to become one of the largest Israel-related annual events. The first national conference was held in November in Washington D.C. and drew over 750 participants and speakers. During an on-stage discussion about the Palestinian issue between IAC's two megadonors, Saban and Adelson, the former insisted on the two-state solution to keep Israel both Democratic and Jewish. Adelson, in response, quipped \\"Israel isn‚Äôt going to be a democratic state ‚Äì so what?\\" A year, it was reported that Saban has ended his involvement in IAC, allegedly over political differences. In 2017, the conference was held in Washington D.C. Among the speakers were U.S. ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, Israel's UN Representative Danny Danon, Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely, and Member of Knesset Merav Michaeli. The fifth IAC National Conference in 2018 was held in Florida with over 3,100 attendees. Speakers included Vice President Mike Pence, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Democratic Leader, Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Speaker of the Israeli Knesset Yuli Edelstein, Israel's Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, and Israeli-American businessmen such as Marius Nacht and Maya Prosor. U.S. President Donald Trump spoke at IAC's sixth national conference in December 2019. He claimed that some Jews \\"don't love Israel enough\\" and, addressing the audience of 4,000 Jews: \\"You‚Äôre not going to vote for the wealth tax. Let‚Äôs take 100 percent of your wealth away. No, no. Even if you don‚Äôt like me ‚Äì and some of you don‚Äôt, some of you I don‚Äôt like at all actually ‚Äì and you‚Äôre going to be my biggest supporters because you‚Äôll be out of business in about 15 minutes.\\" While the audience cheered, some commentators claimed Trump's remarks were anti-Semitic. Israeli-American Coalition for Action The Israeli-American Coalition for Action (IAC for Action, formerly the Israeli-American Nexus), founded in 2016, is the lobbying arm of IAC. Its focus issues include supporting economic collaboration between the United States and Israel, lobbying for anti-BDS laws to force government contractors to promise not to boycott Israel, and Iran which Israel sees as a threat.

It was produced by Michael Atwell at LWT's London Minorities Unit, and was the United Kingdom's first LGBT television series.  Production  Gay himself, Atwell said that the programme could claim to be \\"the first time in the world that a major national TV company has given a whole series to gays\\". Three members of Gay Life production team were gay, and Atwell said the staff felt that they were \\"in a sense trying to ride two horses - putting forward the gay viewpoint and relating to non-gay people\\". Gay Life was broadcast late on a Sunday evening in the London region, and was first shown on 10 February 1980 at 11:30 pm. Notable contributors included comedian Graham Chapman, who spoke of his experience as a gay parent in the February 24 episode.  Reception  The debut episode was reviewed by John Russell Taylor in the following week's issue of Gay News. In his essay \\"Something for Everyone\\" included in the critical theory book Queer TV: Theories, Histories, Politics, edited by Glyn Davis and Gary Needham, Gregory Woods wrote Taylor's review had raised \\"basic but crucial questions that would keep cropping up in relation to gay television programmes for the next two decades\\". Taylor's questions concerned the visibility of men in drag and leather who because of their frequent appearances as representative of the gay community in news reports \\"led the straight media to treat gayness as extraordinary, and therefore had to seek out vivid representatives of it in order to confirm their own per-constructed idea of it\\" and also his belief that the programme may adopt divided aims in an attempt to appeal to both \\"uncomprehending straights\\" and its desire to \\"preach to the converted\\". Richard Ingrams negatively reviewed the 10 July 1981 episode of Gay Life as the television critic for The Spectator. In his column he wrote that \\"I at last managed to catch up with the lesbians on Sunday, and about time too is all that I can say\\". The episode discussed artificial insemination of which Ingrams wrote that it was a \\"far more satisfactory method in many lesbian eyes because one can ensure that the donor is a suitable person‚Äîpresumably a Guardian-reading Gay. Various mournful specimens were wheeled on to hail this Brave New World.\\" Ingrams further criticised Gay Life by saying: and concluded by writing:  Episodes  Source:  References   External links  Gay Life at the British Film Institute 1980 British television series debuts 1981 British television series endings 1980s British LGBT-related television series 1980 in LGBT history British LGBT-related television shows English-language television shows London Weekend Television shows ","title":"Gay Life (TV series)"},{"id":"47105490","text":"The Hermagoras Society ( or ) is Slovenia's oldest publishing house and has branches in Klagenfurt (Austria), Celje (Slovenia), and Gorizia (Italy).

Tensions took a dramatic turn for the worse on 11‚Äì13 January, with reports of unusual troop and naval deployments, crisis meetings of the National Security Council, and the erection of police roadblocks. Rumours also swept the capital that the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, had been arrested by the police on government orders, but the Military denied this. The crisis came to a head on the 13th, with Bainimarama announcing that he had dismissed the Acting Land Force Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jone Baledrokadroka for insubordination. This event was a precursor to the military coup that finally took place on 5 December 2006. The Republic of Fiji Military Forces suffered serious and deep divisions when a faction of elite soldiers helped stage a coup on May 19, 2000 and later led a bloody mutiny attempt on November 2 the same year. The target of the failed mutiny, which left five rebel and three loyalist soldiers dead, was the commander of the RFMF Commodore Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama. The mutiny left Bainimarama shaken and deeply suspicious of any of his officer coups who contradicted him. In the years that followed there were several low-key internal differences in the RFMF over Bainimarama's continued public standoff with the government of Laisenia Qarase. By January 2006, these differences were beginning to spill out into the public domain, most notably with the confrontation between Bainimarama and his second-in- command Lieutenant-Colonel Jone Baledrokadroka over the ongoing public feud.  Overview  At first it seemed the military was moving to take over the government between January 11‚Äì13, with unusual troop and naval deployments around the capital. Military establishments were barricaded and rumours spread that the military was preparing to seize power. Rumours also swept the capital that the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, had been arrested by the police on government orders, but the military denied this. In response the government called crisis meetings of the National Security Council and police checkpoints were set up. It was an internal military crisis that began a national concern because for months previously the army's top brass had been hinting at a takeover. The crisis came to a head on the 13th, with Bainimarama announcing that he had dismissed the Acting Land Force Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jone Baledrokadroka for insubordination. Baledrokadroka later said he had confronted Bainimarama about his continued standoff with the government and had tried to persuade him not to stage a coup. Bainimarama, for his part, accused Baledrokadroka of threatening to stage a mutiny.  The Queen Elizabeth Barracks crisis  On the afternoon of the 12th, Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase called an emergency meeting of the National Security Council, following reports of a \\"serious situation\\" at the Queen Elizabeth Barracks earlier in the day. Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes was summoned to the meeting, after which the Prime Minister, accompanied by more than the usual number of body guards, told reporters that the security situation was \\"under control\\", and appealed for calm. The situation at the barracks was said to involve a group of Army officers, led by Lieutenant Colonel Jone Baledrokadroka, Bainimarama's second in command, confronting the Commander about his anti-government statements. This was rumoured to have been followed by a meeting between Bainimarama and other officers, in which he was said to have solicited their support. The Fiji Live news service reported that senior officer Colonel Meli Saubulinayau was subsequently called in to mediate between the two factions, and was said to have defused the tension. Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni denied the rumours, claiming that no unscheduled meetings had taken place. However, the gates to the camp were closed and guarded by armed military police, an unusual move. Captain Leweni denied reports that Commodore Bainimarama had been arrested, and said that he remained in charge of the Military. This was confirmed by Bainimarama himself when he appeared in public at a rugby union training session at Albert Park that evening. There was no instability in the barracks, he insisted. \\"All the rumours that are going around regarding the meeting and my arrest are all false. None of it is true,\\" Fiji Live quoted him as saying. He insisted that the meetings held that day had been \\"normal procedure\\", asking rhetorically, \\"Would I be here if there was instability between my senior officers and me?\\" He denied rumours that two senior officers alleged to have confronted him had been detained in a cell at the Nabua barracks on his orders. There was nothing sinister about the closing of the barracks gates, he said. He had been at dinner at the time and had ordered the gates to be closed because he had not wanted to be bothered talking the media, who were outside, he claimed.  Naval and police deployments  Unusual naval movements were also reported. In what the Navy described as an exercise to test the ability of its fleet to react to emergencies, three vessels were sent out into Suva Harbour and kept watch over Government House. The naval headquarters was also placed under guard. Naval spokesman Lieutenant Commander Bradley Bower later claimed that the navy had only been conducting \\"normal routine exercises.\\" By nightfall, police roadblocks were going up around Suva, ostensibly to maintain law and order. The Police Tactical Response Unit, established to respond quickly to emergencies, was also put on special alert, the Fiji Times reported the next day. Police spokesmen Lemeki Ravai and Jahir Khan denied that the roadblocks were connected with the crisis, however. They were part of Operation Sasamaki, they claimed - a crackdown on road offenders and petty criminals. There were also reports of increased security at Nadi International Airport. It was announced that Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola would meet Acting President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi the next morning to discuss the outcome of Madraiwiwi's talks with the Commander earlier in the week. The meeting would decide what disciplinary action, if any, would be taken against the Commander for his frequent outbursts against government policies, it was said. Various news outlets produced conflicting quotes from Commodore Bainimarama, on whether he had, or had not, met with Madraiwiwi on the 11th. On the afternoon of the 12th, however, he told the Fiji Village news service that the meeting had in fact taken place, but declined to reveal any details about what had been discussed.  The dismissal of Lieutenant Colonel Baledrokadroka  Fiji Live reported that Commodore Bainimarama had dismissed Baleidrokadroka from his position of Land Force Commander, in the wake of the previous day's altercation. The dismissal was confirmed by Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni and by Baleidrokadroka himself, who told Fiji Television that he was on leave, pending resignation. Bainimarama himself had taken over the command in person, it was reported. On 15 January, he told a press conference that two new Chiefs of Staff - Colonel Pita Driti as Chief of Staff Land Force, based at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks, and Captain Esala Teleni as Chief of Staff Strategic Headquarters in central Suva. New Zealand's The Sunday Star-Times newspaper reported on 15 January that Baledrokadroka was the brother of Senator Adi Lagamu Vuiyasawa, the common-law wife of Ratu Inoke Takiveikata, the Qaranivalu (Paramount Chief) of Naitasiri, who has been convicted and imprisoned for his role in the mutiny of 2 November 2000. The Sunday Star- Times considered this detail important, and noted that all of Fiji's newspapers had omitted to mention it.  Baledrokadroka's version  Baledrokadroka told the Fiji Times on the 14th that he had resigned rather than obey a \\"treasonous\\" order of Bainimarama's. \\"I asked the commander for his resignation on the grounds that it was perfectly clear that he was going to commit treason,\\" he told the Fiji Times. In a further statement the next day, he clarified that at a meeting of senior officers on the 9th, Bainimarama had hinted that he might be arrested and instructed them to come and free him in such an event. He denied claims by unnamed army sources that he had tried to stage a mutiny. \\"I am a professional soldier and I would not dream of such a thing,\\" he said emphatically. He told Fiji Live the next day that the crisis for him had begun when he had told a colleagues at a meeting of Commissioned Senior Officers that he was opposed to the Commander's recent antigovernment pronouncements. His motive for opposing the Commander was professional, not political, he claimed, and emphasized that he would not change his stand. Speaking to the Fiji Sun on the 14th, Baleidrokadroka condemned the Commander for accusing him of threatening to shoot him. \\"He has lied and he knows that he is lying,\\" Baledrokadroka declared. \\"... I absolutely deny that I threatened violence against the Commander and I‚Äôm deeply shocked at the allegations.\\" On the 16th, Baledrokadroka denied claims made by the Fiji Labour Party and by Commodore Bainimarama himself that he had colluded with Prime Minister Qarase in an attempt to depose the Commander. \\"They (the FLP) are still sort of hanging on to that, the victim thesis that they have been the victim of coups in the past and its only fair in their eyes that the Commander do something, whatever it is. At the moment it looks to be extra constitutional,\\" he told Fiji Television. He further claimed that Bainimarama had attempted to trick him into executing a coup. The second paragraph of an order handed to him on 8 January seemed \\"sinister\\", he said, and claimed \\"legal experts\\" (whom he did not name) concurred with his opinion that it was tantamount to a coup plot.  Bainimarama's version  Fiji Village reported on 14 January that at a press conference held that afternoon, Commodore Bainimarama said that Baleidrokadroka had been dismissed for insubordination and for failing the loyalty test of the Military. The command which Baleidrokadroka had refused to obey had been only a test, which he had failed miserably, the Commander claimed. He had been willing to give Baleidrokadroka another chance, he said, but Baleidrokadroka had made matters worse by talking to the media. Baleidrokadroka's dismissal would be a lesson to other potential insubordinates, he said. The message was clear that any acts of insubordination would be dealt with quickly and decisively. \\"Now soldiers know what will happen if they support JB,\\" Fiji Live reported him as saying. \\"Obedience is paramount in the army.\\" Bainimarama was joined by Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni, who revealed that Military Police were now investigating the circumstances surrounding the barracks crisis that led to Baleidrokadroka's resignation, and a Board of Inquiry had been set up. On 16 January, Lieutenant Colonel Etueni Caucau, Bainimarama's legal adviser, told Fiji Live that an inquiry was necessary to prevent a repeat of the 2000 mutiny. A number of \\"borderline officers\\" had been identified whose loyalty would be investigated, Caucau said. Caucau had earlier told Fiji Live on the 14th that Baleidrokadroka had \\"threatened\\" the Commander and had been confined to his office by other senior officers to prevent him from carrying out his threat. Baleidrokadroka's claim to have outside support, and his alleged attempts to elicit support from soldiers, was what had prompted the closing and guarding of the barracks' gates, Caucau added. The Fiji Times quoted Bainimarama on the 16th as saying that Baleidrokadroka had threatened shoot him not once but twice. \\"First was on Thursday when I called him on the mobile. He said he was going to shoot me and then again on Friday when I met him face-to-face,\\" he told the Times. \\"I have a witness to that account.\\" He said he was going to present his \\"evidence\\" that Baleidrokadroka had wconspired with senior government officials to plot against him. Acting President Madraiwiwi held separate meetings with Bainimarama and Prime Minister Qarase. Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola was present at the latter meeting, at which it was agreed that the Acting President, Prime Minister, and Military Commander would meet on the morning of 16 January (Monday). Increased security around Government House, the President's official residence, was evident. Appealing for calm, the Prime Minister reiterated earlier assurances that there was no threat to stability.  Suva calm, but ...  Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes announced that police officers were resuming \\"normal duties,\\" following a personal assurance from Commodore Bainimarama that there was no threat to national security. The national security alert had been unnecessary and the rumours sweeping the nation had been \\"media generated,\\" he considered. He also denied rumours that weapons recently purchased by the police were to counter the Military should the need arise. \\"They are not in any sense part of a program initiated by government by me or by anybody else to equip the police to somehow ... counter any military threat,\\" he insisted. \\"There is no way the police are gearing up to take on that role.\\"  Investigation  Two separate but parallel investigations, one conducted by the Military and one by the civil service, were launched into the incident. = The Military investigation = Captain Neumi Leweni, a spokesman for the Fijian Military, announced on 20 January that four senior army officers had been appointed the day before to investigate the alleged mutiny plot. The four officers would not be named until they had completed their work, Leweni said. The Board of Inquiry met for the first time on 25 January at Queen Elizabeth Barracks. Leweni said that meetings would continue throughout the week, but could not set out a time frame for the investigations. Commodore Bainimarama confirmed that he had been summoned to appear before the board on the 27th, but Baledrokadroka had not been summoned, according to his lawyer, Devanesh Sharma. Leweni said that several senior officers had been implicated in the plot. Fiji Television revealed on 30 January that Baledrokadroka had been summoned, but that Leweni said that a letter had been received from Baledrokadroka's lawyers seeking clarification on the membership and proceedings of the Board of Inquiry. Home Affairs Chief Executive Officer Lesi Korovavala was also summoned, but refused, citing his workload. The Military was displeased by his refusal, Leweni said. Lawyer Sharma said on 1 February that Baledrokadroka was willing to testify, but only if certain issues were clarified. Sharma cited the constitutional rights of defendants not to testify against themselves. Baledrokadroka finally did appear before the board on 2 February, after his constitutional rights had been clarified by lawyers. He handed over a written statement; neither he nor the Military made any comments outside as to what it contained. Lieutenant Colonel Samuela Saumatua was revealed as the Chairman of the Board of Inquiry on 3 February. The same day, it was revealed that the inquiry would continue, despite the noncooperation of a number of government officials. Military lawyer Major Kitione Tuinaosara was quoted by Fiji Live on 4 February as saying that investigations could be concluded within a week. More than 60 witnesses with military connections had been called, Tuinaosara said. He denied that Baledrokadroka himself was the primary focus of the investigation; the object of it was to determine what actually happened on 12 January, he said. Leweni told Fiji Live on 10‚Äì11 February that Korovavala's testimony would no longer been needed, even though he had recently changed his earlier refusal to give evidence. Over 60 witnesses had been called. A source reported to be close to Baledrokadroka quoted him as threatening to open \\"a can of worms\\" on the Military if forced to testify. Meanwhile, lawyer Devanesh Sharma questioned the validity of the Board of Inquiry, saying that its being chaired by Lieutenant Colonel Samuela Saumatua, a subordinate of Baledrokadroka's, was out of order. Leweni denied this. Leweni confirmed to Fiji Village on 14 February that the inquiry had been concluded, and that its findings were to be forwarded to the Legal Section of the Military for a decision on whether to lay any charges against Baledrokadroka or any accomplices he may have had. He did not reveal whether Commodore Bainimarama would take a direct role in the decision. Leweni announced on 28 February that the inquiry had been concluded, and that a report was being compiled. The report would be forwarded to the Legal Division of the Military, he said. Fiji Live and Fiji Television reported on 6 March that the Military was considering a court martial against Baledrokadroka. A civil trial was also a possibility, Tuinaosara told Fiji Live. Fiji Television reported that two other officers would be charged with Baledrokadroka. He reiterated this stance on 13 March. Fiji Village reported that charges of insubordination and mutiny would be laid against Baledrokadroka and his alleged accomplices. = The civil investigation = Radio New Zealand announced on 6 February that Fiji's Public Service Commission (PSC) had appointed an independent team to investigate the allegations that Lesi Korovavala had been involved in the alleged insubordination. Fiji Village quoted PSC Chief Executive Anare Jale on the 8th as disclosing that the team comprised two members. This was later expanded to three members. On 16 February, the PSC named Vasantika Patel, a Nadi lawyer, to lead the investigation against Korovavala. Businessman Tony Philipps and PSC officer Mereani Vuinakodu were also stated to be members of the team. On 27 February, Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni publicly asked whey Korovavala had not been suspended from his office, in view of the seriousness of the allegations against him. According to the Fiji Sun, he pointed out that a conviction for a similar offence had resulted in a life sentence for the Qaranivalu of Naitasiri, Ratu Inoke Takiveikata, and that an allegation of a much lesser offence had resulted in the forced transferral of Poseci Bune from his secretaryship of the PSC to the Foreign Ministry and subsequently to the diplomatic service. (Bune was later found innocent). PSC Chairman Stuart Huggett responded that no action could be taken against Korovavala while investigations were in progress.

Today the factory is abandoned, but delayed plans to repair it and add a new distillery for ethanol production have been underway since 2007.  History  Cane Quality Laboratory Sugar production in Belize grew in the mid-1800s as Yucat√°n immigrants fled the Caste War and began cultivating sugarcane in British Honduras. British interest in exporting sugar led to the development of large plantations in the Corozal and Orange Walk regions. Sugar production peaked in the 1880s with 2.5 million pounds being exported, then decreasing to 200,000 pounds by the 1890s. With declining colonial sugar exports worrying the British government, the Corozal Sugar Factory was built in Pembroke Hall by Henry Melhado & Sons and marked the beginning of the country's modern sugar industry in 1937. However, factory output was stunted and it took 16 years to hit the goal of exporting 2,500 tons of sugar. The following year in 1954, the factory was fully operational and 7,357 tons of sugar were exported; a little over half the output of the 122 small producers in nearby villages. 25% of these small producers worked in San Narciso, 5 miles west of the Corozal Sugar Factory. In 1967, British corporation Tate & Lyle purchased the factory, expanded it, and opened a second factory in Tower Hill near Orange Walk. With these investments, sugarcane became a booming industry for Belize and the standard of living in the Corozal and Orange Walk region improved. A 1975 Tate & Lyle 'Annual Visit' document reveals some of the challenges the plant faced in maintaining high production at the peak of world sugar prices in the 1970s: * An additional sugarcane grab was ordered to move and bundle the cane within the factory. The 1 hydraulically operated grab couldn't keep up with the number of trucks arriving each day to deliver sugarcane. * Export sugar quality incurred substantial penalties for failing to meet American refiners' quality standards. Moisture, Color, Ash, and Grain Size penalties totaled ¬£9,050 in 1973(41,650 tons shipped) and ¬£28,000 in 1974(46,200 tons shipped). The plant consultants, J.D. Blanchard and R.R. Trott, suggested handling the sugar in barges and sometimes storing it in Belize City contributed to the low quality.  Sugar prices and closing  Historic Sugar Prices A substantial increase in world sugar prices in the 1970s was followed by a slump in the 1980s. These unstable sugar prices can be attributed to several factors: * A decline of sugar consumption in developed countries (notably the United States, Canada, and Japan) and increase of consumption in developing countries. * The United States protecting domestic producers by setting internal sugar prices. Japan also levied high duties and taxes on imported sugar. * The criticism of sugar and emergence of sugar alternatives such as High Fructose Corn Syrup in the 1970s (cereals even removed the word \\"sugar\\" from their titles). Depressed sugar prices led Tate & Lyle to close the Corozal Sugar Factory in 1985 and divest 90% of its interest in the Tower Hill factory to employees.  Reopening  In 1989, the factory was leased to Jamaican petroleum company, Petrojam, and reopened for the production of molasses. The molasses was then exported to Jamaica where it was refined into ethanol. Through the Caribbean Basin Initiative, this ethanol was sold to the United States duty-free. The factory was closed again in 1997.  Today  Inside the factory (2015) Today, all sugarcane in northern Belize is processed at the Tower Hill factory owned by Belize Sugar Industries (BSI) in Orange Walk. Plans to reopen the Corozal Sugar Factory have been delayed. In 2007, the largest ethanol producer in Mexico and a Panama company created a joint venture, Destill Belize Ethanol, to reopen the factory and produce ethanol. The factory remains abandoned with a few large ethanol tanks in use adjacent to the main building.

He received a US patent 2,460,707 in February 1949, after a process of 17 years in discussions with the patent office. The title of the patent is \\"Electrotherapeutic Device\\", and although radiotherapy is mentioned, no details are given. During the 1920s, Thomas Henry Moray was one of the most talented electronic circuit designers in the emerging field of radio. After hundreds of experiments designed to improve radio reception, Moray claimed to have discovered a source of energy transmission apparently available everywhere. Using advanced ideas in solid state detectors, he developed a power source which he claimed to produce 50,000 watts of a cold form of electricity. By the early 1930s, dozens of people had reportedly witnessed demonstrations of this technology. In 1944 Moray was paid $25 a day by the rural electrification administration to perfect his system of drawing electrical energy out of the atmosphere. His invention claimed to produce electricity with no exterior input of energy. After many demonstrations the components of the device would break down and fail. T. Henry Moray spent a great portion of his life traveling the world to try to find more reliable materials for his device. The primary component of the device was a non-heated vacuum tube. At the time most vacuum tubes had heaters built inside. The Patent Office refused to grant his Patent, initially, because they claimed that any vacuum tube without a heater would not work. He was never granted a Patent for his power supply device. He did have other inventions and was able to obtain a Patent for one of those, the Electrotherapeutic device. There is much debate about the science and physics of his electrical power supply invention.

Led by Neal Ford and featuring members who were all capable songwriters, the band was a forerunner in the development of psychedelic music in the region, along with their contemporaries, The 13th Floor Elevators and the Moving Sidewalks. The group released one album in 1967 before disbanding later in 1970. History In the end of 1964, Neal Ford (lead vocals), a veteran of the local pop scene with other groups like the Ramadas and the VIPs, formed the first line-up of Neal Ford and the Fanatics, which consisted of Johnny Stringfellow (lead guitar), Jon Pereles (rhythm guitar, vocals), W. T. Johnson (bass guitar), Dennis Senter (keyboards), and John Cravey (drums). Though not as experimental as their contemporary, The 13th Floor Elevators, the band possessed an appreciation for the British Invasion groups, emphasized organ-driven instrumentals, and a R&B-inspired; rhythm atypical of other garage rock acts. At first, the group went relatively unnoticed performing cover versions of songs by The Animals, The Zombies, and James Brown locally in their own club named Teen Scene, until record producer Ray Rush saw promise in the developing band, specifically their spontaneous live act. As a result, Neal Ford and the Fanatics recorded the song \\"I Will Not Be Lonely\\" at ACA-Recording Studios, and released the single in May 1965 on GINA records. The single was among the first in Texas to note \\"British influence\\", received airplay in Houston, and managed to reach the regional charts. Shortly thereafter, Ford was called up from the Naval Reserve, and, until late-1965, the band's recording activities were at a standstill. Upon Ford's returned Senter was replaced by Steven Ames (n√© Stephen Charles Ames; born 1947), while his older brother, Richard \\"Dick\\" Ames (n√© Richard Curtis Ames; 1940‚Äì2008), created Tantara Records to release the group's second single, the folk rock tune, \\"Bitter Bells\\", in January 1966. Through the summer of 1966, Neal Ford and the Fanatics profile rose steadily, with extensive airplay in Houston, multiple appearances on the Larry Kane Show, and well-attended shows at a venue called the Catacombs alongside nationally successful acts including The Beach Boys and The Lovin' Spoonful. Ford recalls, \\"We got a tremendous amount of exposure. It was a good time to be playing rock and roll music. It was the last time that radio stations could really help local groups and accentuate the talent that was in the area.\\" By the summer of 1966, Ames departed the band to pursue a management position for the group, The Moving Sidewalks. He was replaced by Vox organ virtuoso Lanier Grieg, who created a new sound for the band and collaborated with the members to pen more original compositions. In October 1966, Neal Ford and the Fanatics recorded demos of songs including \\"I Can't Go On\\" and \\"Good Men\\", among others, to earn a contract with the national label, Hickory Records. The only non-original song recorded during the sessions was a radical take on The Zombies', \\"Woman\\". Two regionally successful singles followed with \\"I Will If You Want To\\" receiving national attention in September 1966, and \\"Gonna Be My Girl\\" reaching number one in Houston in early 1967. Their debut album, Neal Ford and the Fanatics was released soon after. However, their next single, \\"Wait for Me\\" failed to produce the national breakthrough the group anticipated, and none of their later offerings in 1968 met the same acclaim as \\"Gonna Be My Girl\\". The band continued to perform on the local club circuit but in 1969 Ford quit and eventually produced a solo album in 1971. More songs without Ford were recorded but not distributed and in October 1970 the group disbanded. In 2013, Ace Records (United Kingdom) released \\"Good Men,\\" a compilation focusing on the group's more rocking sides. In 2019, Chunk Archives Recordings released \\"Every Night a New Surprise,\\" with garage rock veteran Mal Thursday adding vocals and harmonica to a previously unfinished Neal Ford and The Fanatics backing track from 1966.

Estimated to date to 1809, it is one Limerick's few brick 19th-century houses, and possibly its oldest. It was owned by a single family for 144 years. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The Harper Family House is located on the west side of Route 5, in southern Limerick between Woodridge Drive and Austin Lane. It is a brick Cape style house, 1-1/2 stories in height, with a side gable roof, two chimneys, and a granite foundation. The main facade, facing roughly east, is eight bays wide, reflecting an original five-bay block and a wing whose front is flush with that block. A wood frame ell extends to the rear, joining the house to a modern garage and barn. The front facade has two entrances, one an elaborate Federal period surround with sidelights at the center of the original main block. Alterations to the building have been relatively limited, including the addition of dormers and the replacement of the front door. The house is believed to have been built about 1809, although there is no documentary evidence to support this. It was the centerpiece of a farm that also included a blacksmithy. The house was probably built by Samuel Harper, who settled the land in 1787, around the time of his son Ezekial's marriage. The only other brick houses in Limerick of 19th century origin are Greek Revival and Italianate in style, dating to the middle of the century. This house was sold out of the Harper family in the 1950s.

(‚àí16 ff.), 11x25 cm, single column, (10x22 cm), 4 lines main text, 2‚Äì4 lines of interlinear commentary for each text line, in Jain Devanagari book script, filled with red and yellow, 17 paintings in colours mostly of Svetambara Jain monks, influenced by the Mughal style. The text is a Prakrit didactic work of how best to live a proper Jain life, aimed probably at the laity. The Svetambara pontiff, Sri Dharmadasaga√Æ, lived in the mid-6th century. The Old Gujarati prose commentary was written in 1487. The colophon gives the place, date, and the name of the religious leader, Sri Nandalalaji, on whose order the work was transcribed. Old GujarƒÅtƒ´ (; 1200 CE‚Äì1500 CE), the ancestor of modern Gujarati and Rajasthani, was spoken by the Gurjars, who were residing and ruling in Gujarat, Punjab, Rajputana and central India. The language was used as literary language as early as the 12th century. Texts of this era display characteristic Gujarati features such as direct/oblique noun forms, postpositions, and auxiliary verbs. It had three genders, as Gujarati does today, and by around the time of 1300 CE, a fairly standardized form of this language emerged. While generally known as Old Gujarati, some scholars prefer the name of Old Western Rajasthani, based on the argument that Gujarati and Rajasthani were not yet distinct. Factoring into this preference was the belief that modern Rajasthani sporadically expressed a neuter gender, based on the incorrect conclusion that the [≈©] that came to be pronounced in some areas for masculine [o] after a nasal consonant was analogous to Gujarati's neuter [≈©].Smith, J.D. (2001) \\"Rajasthani.\\" Facts about the world's languages: An encyclopedia of the world's major languages, past and present. Ed. Jane Garry, and Carl Rubino: New England Publishing Associates. pp. 591-593. A formal grammar, Prakrita Vyakarana, of the precursor to this language, Gurjar Apabhra·πÉ≈õa, was written by Jain monk and eminent scholar Acharya Hemachandra Suri in the reign of Chaulukya king Jayasimha Siddharaja of Anhilwara (Patan). Literature Major works were written in various genres, for the most part in verse form, such as: *rƒÅsa, predominantly didactic narrative, of which the earliest known is ≈öƒÅlibhadras≈´ri's BhƒÅrate≈õvarabƒÅhubali (1185). *phƒÅgu, in which springtime is celebrated, of which the earliest is Jinapadmas≈´ri's Sirith≈´libadda (c. 1335). The most famous is the VasantavilƒÅsa, of unknown authorship, which is undeterminedly dated to somewhere in 14th or 15th century, or possibly earlier. *bƒÅrmƒÅsƒ´, describing natural beauty during each of the twelve months. *ƒÅkhyƒÅna, in which sections are each in a single metre. Narsinh Mehta (c. 1414‚Äì1480) is traditionally viewed as the father of modern Gujarati poetry. By virtue of its early age and good editing, an important prose work is the 14th- century commentary of Taru·πáaprabha, the ·π¢a·∏çƒÅva≈õyakabƒÅlabodhavrÃ•tti. Phonology The retroflex lateral flap (·∏∑) is generally absent, which is however rather common in Modern Gujarati. This may indicate that it was a later re-introduction, perhaps under the influence of Marathi with the Maratha confederacy. References Further reading *Bender, E.

Following a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary, the campaign was suspended on February 10, 2016. He endorsed Donald Trump on February 26, 2016. Background Chris Christie speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference Some political commentators viewed Christie as a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. According to polls conducted after the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal, which began in September 2013, Christie sustained a substantial erosion in his political standing and his 2016 presidential campaign prospects, and polls show him behind Hillary Clinton in general election polling. In an interview on Fox News on March 31, 2014, Christie stated that he was still in \\"decision- making process\\" regarding a possible run in 2016, and forwarded the names of Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Paul Ryan as his top three GOP candidate choices. 2012 presidential election Christie contemplated running for president in the 2012 election, but ultimately declined to do so. He was vetted, but not chosen, by Mitt Romney as a potential vice-presidential candidate. The Romney campaign was reported to have asked him to resign his governorship if he became the vice-presidential nominee because \\"pay to play\\" laws restrict campaign contributions from financial corporation executives to governors running for federal office when the companies do business with the governor's state. A memo from the campaign attributed Romney's decision not to choose Christie as his running mate in part to unanswered questions during the vetting process regarding a defamation lawsuit following Christie's initial campaign for Morris County Freeholder, a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of Christie's brother, as well as his weight. Christie gave the keynote address at the 2012 Republican National Convention. Republican Governors Association Governor Chris Christie campaigning with Gubernatorial candidate Doug Ducey in Arizona. On November 21, 2013, Christie was elected Chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Christie campaigned extensively on behalf of Republican governors who were running for reelection, and for Republican gubernatorial candidates seeking to defend open seats or flip Democratic-held ones. The association raised $117 million during his chairmanship. The largest donors were Koch industries and David H. Koch, which together gave $3.5 million, and Sheldon Adelson, who donated $3.5 million. Christie's tenure as Chairman was seen as successful, as Republicans held all of their 22 seats aside from Alaska and Pennsylvania, while picking up governorships in Arkansas, Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts that had been previously held by Democrats.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/11/06/elections- chris-christie-rga-impact/18579793/ Political action committees The political action committee Leadership Matters was launched January 25, 2015, in order to raise funds and set the groundwork for what Time magazine called \\"a likely 2016 presidential campaign\\". The America Leads super PAC, headed by Phil Cox, was registered with the Federal Election Commission on February 23, 2015. As of mid-July the latter had raised $11 million. As of December 2016 the organisation was still in operation. As of April 2017, the campaign still had outstanding debts. Campaign launch Christie formally launched his 2016 presidential campaign on June 30, 2015, at his high school in Livingston, New Jersey. He had already launched his campaign website on June 27. At the announcement he stated that both political parties had \\"failed our country\\", and called for more compromise in politics. \\"I am now ready to fight for the people,\\" Christie said in his announcement speech. \\"I am proud to announce my candidacy for the Republican nomination for the presidency of the United States of America.\\" Christie began his campaign with a stop in Maine where he met with Maine Governor Paul LePage, who is the first sitting Republican governor to offer an endorsement for any of the party's 2016 presidential candidates. Calling LePage's endorsement an honor, Christie said, \\"To receive an endorsement from someone who knows what it's like to run a blue state, who knows what it's like to make tough decisions, who knows what it's like to engage in hand-to-hand combat to try to get things done for the people who elect you ‚Äì to get an endorsement from Paul LePage today is an incredible honor.\\" Greg Brown, chairman and chief executive officer of Motorola Solutions, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, chair of the Rutgers board, and executive committee member of the Business Roundtable, was a member of the campaign's finance committee. New Jersey State Police security detail Christie has said that his campaign will not reimburse the state for the tax-payer funded New Jersey State Police security detail which travels with him on campaign trips. Between 2010‚Äì2014, the state police billed the state $1 million. There have also been more than $800,000 in credit-card expenses related to political and private trips made by the governor, which the administration has refused to make public. Costs to taxpayers for the first quarter of 2015 were $185,000. \\"We're going to continue to conduct this in the same way I've always conducted it,\\" Christie said. New Jerseyeans are overwhelmingly opposed to paying for the Executive Protection Unit for Christie's campaign. Christie regularly makes use of the state police helicopter for official and unofficial business, for which his campaign partially reimburses the state. The New Jersey Senate is considering a bill which would require reimbursement of \\"expenses incurred for travel, food, lodging, security, or any other purposes not directly related to the Governor's regular and official duties as Governor\\" when traveling out of state to engage in political activities. Christie and his campaign are being sued by three advocacy organisations (New Jersey Citizen Action, New Jersey Families Alliance and BlueWaveNJ) as well as several New Jersey residents who cite his absenteeism from the governorship and misuse of funds. After withdrawing from the race, Christie continued to travel to campaign for Trump. In the first quarter of 2016 travel costs for the security detail were $170,000, a considerable drop. Absence from state Christie was absent from New Jersey 261 days in 2015. Christie was highly criticized for first not planning to return to New Jersey and then staying only briefly for the January 2016 United States blizzard. When asked why he was campaigning in New Hampshire when parts of the Jersey Shore were flooded in sea water Christie said: \\"What do you want me to do, go down there with a mop?\\" Records show 190 full days and 71 partial days in 2015 cost NJ taxpayers about $614,000. The final quarter of 2015, when Christie spent 32 days out of state campaigning for the presidency, cost $193,890.http://www.northjersey.com/news/christie-s- travel-last-year-cost-taxpayers-over-600-000-1.1526782 The bills totaled cost $492,420 in 2014, $220,355 in 2013; $248,277 in 2012; $129,842 in 2011 and $64,975 in 2010, which did not include the cost of overtime for the State Police troopers in EPU, which according to state regulations is confidential. A lawsuit which claimed that Christie \\"inappropriately forced New Jersey taxpayers to cover the cost of the governor's security and other key expenses while pursuing the presidency\\" was dismissed. Approval ratings In December 2015/January 2016 Christie's approval ratings in New Jersey dropped to their lowest ever during his tenure to 31%. Debates Polling had created uncertainty about Christie qualifying for participation in the jointly sponsored Fox News-Facebook Republican Party presidential debate, the first of the election cycle, on August 6, 2015, which allows for the 10 highest-polling politicians to participate. Christie claimed he would qualify. The methodology used for inclusion is not known. Christie placed ninth in the polls, qualifying for a place. Christie's average standing in polls conducted after the debate raised questions as to whether he would be permitted to participate in the main stage CNN primetime debate in September. Christie ranked 10th in qualifying polls. Christie did not have the necessary 2.5% standing to participate in the November main stage event, but with 1% qualified for the earlier undercard debate event. A rapid improvement his poll numbers however saw him being propelled back to the main stage for the debate on December 15. Christie made debatable claims in the January 14, 2016, debate. In the February 6, 2016, GOP debate, Christie attacked Marco Rubio, who was polling in third place nationally, criticizing him for repeating his \\"25 second speech\\" and not getting to the issues at hand on the campaign trail. His attacks, combined with a verbal gaffe by Rubio, were seen as a devastating blow to his campaign and contributed to his fifth-place finish in New Hampshire. Christie placed sixth. Iowa and New Hampshire Christie speaking at an event hosted by the Iowa Republican Party in October 2015. He spent considerable time in Iowa in 2014 laying groundwork. He had little expectation to win. He placed 10th in a field of 12 candidates with 1.8% of the ballots cast. Having claimed he would be \\"number one\\" of the state governors running, he came in 4th. Christie focused much of his campaign's effort in winning the New Hampshire Republican primary, for which a former Governor's Office staff member and political operative began working in winter 2014. On January 4, 2016, at his campaign headquarters in New Hampshire Christie said \\"I'm going to be up here until Wednesday night. We'll take a short break, go back home, deliver the State of the State address the week after next in New Jersey, and then come back out on the road again\\". Christie campaigned extensively using a town meeting format, but in polls before the primary slipped and he fell behind. He spent 70 days in the state. In the New Hampshire debate he attacked candidate Marco Rubio. He placed sixth in a field of nine in the New Hampshire primary on February 9. Trump endorsement Christie campaigning for Trump and the 2016 Republican National Convention Christie endorsed Donald Trump on February 26, 2016. and began campaigning for him. Following the announcement the publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader, which had endorsed Christie, said that Christie had committed to him that he would never endorse Trump. A few days later the paper ran an editorial which stated that it had been wrong to endorse Christie.http://www.unionleader.com/An-Editorial-Joseph-W-McQuaid- Publisher-Christie-was-our-bad-choice Watching Christie kiss the Donald's ring this weekend ‚Äî and make excuses for the man Christie himself had said was unfit for the presidency ‚Äî demonstrated how wrong we were. Rather than standing up to the bully, Christie bent his knee. Hewlett-Packard chief executive Meg Whitman, a major contributor who served in the role of National Finance Co-Chair for Christie's ill-fated campaign, called the endorsement \\"an astonishing display of political opportunism.\\" The New York Times called the new relationship with Trump \\"a bully bromance\\". Of the endorsement, Governor of Ohio John Kasich, the only governor left in the Republican presidential nominee field, said he was \\"a little bit surprised\\" and \\"it happens\\".

I don't believe that his endorsement of Donald Trump says much of anything of why I chose to endorse him.\\" On March 2, 2016, six New Jersey-based Gannett Company-owned newspaper called for Christie's resignation. The papers Asbury Park Press, Courier-News (Bridgewater), The Courier-Post (Cherry Hill), Home News Tribune (East Brunswick), Daily Record (Morristown), The Daily Journal, (Vineland) in a joint editorial said: \\"We're fed up with his long neglect of the state to pursue his own selfish agenda. We're disgusted with his endorsement of Donald Trump after he spent months on the campaign trail trashing him, calling him unqualified by temperament and experience to be president,\\" the editorial read. \\"And we're fed up with his continuing travel out of state on New Jersey's dime, stumping for Trump, after finally abandoning his own presidential campaign.\\" On March 3, 2016, the New Jersey Advance Media-owned The Star-Ledger called for Christie's resignation. New Jersey GOP lawmakers Jennifer Beck (R-Monmouth), Amy Handlin (R-Monmouth), Jack Ciattarelli (R-Somerset) said that Christie could not continue to serve as governor if Christie went on the campaign trail for Trump. Following the announcement Christie was severely mocked and ridiculed in social media. Positions Social Security and Medicare In a speech at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics on April 14, 2015, Christie proposed significant reforms to federal benefit programs. The proposals included reductions of Social Security benefits for high-income seniors, an expansion of means testing for Medicare recipients, and an increase in the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare. Christie indicated that his proposals would not affect existing retirees or those close to retirement. Christie proposed comprehensive federal entitlement reforms, stating: \\"In the short term, it is growing the deficit and slowly but surely taking over all of government. In the long term, it will steal our children's future and bankrupt our nation.\\" Christie's proposals would add means testing for Social Security benefits starting with those who make more than $80,000 per year in non-Social Security income and phasing out Social Security benefits entirely for those with more than $200,000 in other income annually. Similarly, Christie's proposals would increase the sliding scale of means testing for Medicare such that seniors with $85,000 in annual income would pay 40% of premium costs and those with more than $196,000 in annual income would pay 90% of premium costs. He also proposed raising the retirement age for Social Security benefits by two months each year starting in 2022, until the retirement age reaches 69. He would likewise raise the age for early retirement from 62 to 64. In addition, he proposed raising the eligibility age for Medicare by one month each year so that seniors would be eligible for benefits at 67 years of age in 2040 and 69 years of age in 2064. Christie also stated: \\"Here's what you'll learn about me. I have been talking about the growth of entitlements as a big problem, at both the state and federal levels, for a number of years. Not because it is politically popular, but because it is true.\\" Supreme Court justices In 2009, Christie said of Sonia Sotomayor: \\"I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination. Qualified appointees should be confirmed and deserve bi-partisan support. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito deserved that support based on their work as Circuit Court Judges. So does Judge Sotomayor. As a result, I support her confirmation. This is a historic moment and her inspiring success story should not only make the Latino community proud, but all Americans.\\" In response to the 2015 Supreme Court rulings regarding the Affordable Health Care Act (King v. Burwell) and same-sex marriage in the United States (Obergefell v. Hodges), Christie said that the outcomes would have been different if the court had more Christie type judges on the bench. Christie also said \\"If you want to know the kind of justices to the Supreme Court that a President Christie would pick, you need to look at one seat on the Supreme Court, and that's the seat of judge Sam Alito.\\" Prison reform Christie supported changes in the criminal justice system which address disparities in sentencing, particularly for non-violent and drug-related crimes. He acknowledges racial disparities in sentencing. Israel‚ÄìPalestine In March 2014, Christie gave a foreign policy speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition also attended by other Republican presidential hopefuls. In it, Christie said that everyone he met in Israel during his visit, wanted America to be an \\"unblinking, unwavering unquestioning friend\\" but worried that this was no longer true. He said that he is in the business to win elections and not just arguments, saying \\"If we want to just have arguments and stand for nothing, we could just form a university.\\" Christie said he was overwhelmed by displays of religious tolerance during his recent trip to Jerusalem and used the term \\"occupied territories\\" in reference to lands in dispute. Christie later apologized for the remark, which is rejected by some conservative Zionists and other supporters of Israel who see it as validating Palestinian views.See Kenneth P. Vogel, \\"Chris Christie apologizes for 'occupied territories' remark\\", POLITICO March 30, 2014. Planned Parenthood As governor, In 2010 Christie vetoed $7.5 million in funding for family planning clinics, including Planned Parenthood, saying the money was duplicative and unaffordable. He vetoed the funding four more times in following years. Christie had repeatedly stated the decision was financial and not one based on his beliefs. In February 2015 he stated. \\"I'm pro-life, I ran as a pro-life candidate in 2009 unapologetically, spoke at the pro-life rally on the steps of the Statehouse -- the first governor to ever speak at a pro-life rally on the steps of the Statehouse -- and vetoed Planned Parenthood funding five times out of the New Jersey budget.\\" \\"I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency, to find private donations,\\" Christie was quoted saying in The Star-Ledger on September 30, 1994. In 2016, Christie said: \\"Well I never donated to Planned Parenthood‚Ä¶\\", Christie claims he was misquoted. NSA domestic surveillance and national security Christie supported the collection of metadata of phone calls of American citizens and denizens by the National Security Agency. Christie had cited his tenure as federal prosecutor to gain credibility with fighting terrorism. as a centerpiece of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. \\"We prosecuted two of the biggest terrorism cases in the world and stopped Fort Dix from being attacked by six American radicalized Muslims from a mosque in New Jersey because we worked with the Muslim American community to get intelligence and we used the Patriot Act to get other intelligence to make sure we did those cases,\\" Christie said. Those cases on his watch and his claims are a source of continuing controversy. with regard to the use of undercover sting operations and informants. National security experts say that other than in two cases, the U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey under Christie had no apparent role in any high-level international terror investigation while he headed the office, stating, \\"When it comes to terrorism prosecutions, of the 320 total convictions since 9/11. Christie has prosecuted only a couple, and both were FBI informant cases‚Äînot international terrorist plots, or even the most serious cases we have see.\\" Firearms In June 2015, Christie said; \\"I know there's a lot of perception about my view on gun rights because I'm from New Jersey and because the laws are the way they are, but these laws were being made long before I was governor and no new ones have been made since I've been governor. During his term as governor Christie has vetoed some proposed legislation, re-written others, and signed on bills regulating firearms. Christie was not invited to attend the NRA convention in April 2016. Christie has defined his changing positions on gun control as \\"evolving\\". The New York Times has called it pandering. On January 16, 2016, Christie said: > I don't support background checks for every gun sale. Fiscal policy As Governor of New Jersey, Christie had received grades of B in 2012 and B in 2014 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors. Syrian refugees On November 16, Christie was interviewed by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt and stated that his state would not take in Syrian refugees, including orphaned toddlers. In October 2014, Christie said \\"I've said before that if there comes a time when the U.S. needs to take some refugees that we should.\\". In January 2016, he said, \\"I said right from the beginning we should take no Syrian Refugees of any kind.\\" Endorsements ;U.S. Governors (current and former) ;U.S. Senators (former) ;U.S. Representatives (current and former) ;U.S. Ambassadors (current and former) ;Republican National Committee members (current and former) ;Statewide officials ;State legislators ;Businesspeople ;Newspapers ;Celebrities, commentators, and activists * New Jersey: Bob Yudin (Bergen County GOP chair).

An accomplished musician, he is chiefly remembered today for his 48 √©tudes for oboe, op. 31, which are commonly studied by oboists and saxophonists.  Life  Ferling was born in Halberstadt on September 20, 1796. At the age of 18, Ferling began serving as a court musician for the Duke of Brunswick, a position which he would hold for most of his life. From 1814 to 1816, he was a military musician, playing the clarinet. Afterwards, he received a job as the principal oboist of the Brunswick court orchestra, a post which he held for 44 years. There, Ferling played a wide variety of styles of music, including bel canto, Romantic music, and sacred music. On November 1, 1858, Ferling filed a petition for pension during his forthcoming retirement, citing persistent rheumatism and impairments in the functioning of his lungs: Ferling was granted pension on full salary, which came into effect on January 1, 1859. The only condition of this arrangement was that Ferling would play occasionally if required. Ferling died in Brunswick on December 18, 1874. Ferling had two sons; Gustav (b. 1835), a pianist and oboist, and Robert (1843-1881), who worked at the Staatstheater Stuttgart and was a court musician to Alexander II of Russia.  Work  Cyrille Rose adapted 32 of Ferling's √©tudes for the clarinet. Ferling is remembered today for his collection of 48 Exercises for Oboe, Op. 31, which are commonly studied by oboists and saxophonists. Published in 1840, there is a complete draft of the studies that dates from 1835, currently housed in the British Library. The 48 studies consist of two √©tudes in each key‚Äîone slow and the other fast. The √©tudes are written in a variety of musical styles: there are five bel canto exercises, six romances, two offertories, four toccatas in the style of Niccol√≤ Paganini, three slow movements, seven marches, twelve waltzes, four polkas, two polonaises, and three czardas. After the √©tudes were published, Cyrille Rose, a French clarinetist, adapted 32 of Ferling's etudes for the clarinet, often transposing the music or changing the meter, articulation, or dynamics. In addition, Rose occasionally omitted some of Ferling's phrases or composed new ones. After the first edition was published in 1840, oboist Louis Bleuzet republished the √©tudes in the early 20th century. Later, Southern Music, under the direction of Albert Andraud, edited and republished Bleuzet's version in an edition that was marketed for \\"oboe or saxophone\\". Marcel Mule also incorporated Ferling's exercises into his own teaching, publishing a version later, although it is unknown whether Mule or Andraud first suggested the studies's use for the saxophone. Meanwhile, oboists continued to study the exercises, with John de Lancie teaching Ferling as one of four √©tude books (the others being the works of Apollon Barret, Henri Brod, and Georges Gillet. In a conversation with de Lancie, oboist and editor Martin Schuring discussed whether or not the √©tudes originally had bass lines, leading Schuring to investigate into the earlier editions of the exercises. While finding that the √©tudes never had bass lines, Schuring noticed discrepancies between the original and modern editions. Because of this, he set out to publish an edition that was closer to the original, a project which Alfred Music distributed. In addition to publishing several other exercises for oboe, Ferling wrote a double concerto for two oboes, which was discovered in a library in the Strahov district of Prague. The work was premiered in 2001 at the annual International Double Reed Society conference. In addition, Ferling composed a clarinet concerto, but it is a lost work, as only fragments remain.  Selected compositions  The selected compositions of Ferling are: *Concertino for Oboe and Orchestra, Op. 5 (1820s) *Divertissement for Oboe quintet, Op. 6 (n.d.) *Concerto for Oboe and Orchestra, Op. 8 (1832) *18 Exercises for Oboe, Op. 12 (n.d.) *3 Duos Concertantes for 2 Oboes, Op. 13 (n.d.) *3 Double concertos for 2 Oboes (n.d.) *Das Jubil√§um, pantomime ballet (1839) *48 Exercises for Oboe, Op. 31 (1840)  References  1796 births 1874 deaths 19th- century classical composers German classical composers German classical oboists Male oboists German male classical composers Military musicians Music in Braunschweig People from Halberstadt 19th-century German composers 19th-century male musicians ","title":"Franz Wilhelm Ferling"},{"id":"47106180","text":"The Weldon Gin Company Historic District encompasses a historic cotton gin complex in Weldon, Arkansas.

While MDMB-CHMICA was initially sold under the name \\"MMB-CHMINACA\\", the compound corresponding to this code name (i.e. the isopropyl instead of t-butyl analogue of MDMB-CHMINACA) has been identified on the designer drug market in 2015 as AMB-CHMINACA.  Chemistry  Several commercial samples of MDMB-CHMICA were found to exclusively contain the (S)-enantiomer based on vibrational and electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. An (S)-configuration for the tert- leucinate group is unsurprising since MDMB-CHMICA is likely synthesized from the abundant and inexpensive \\"L\\" form of the appropriate tert-leucinate reactant.  Pharmacology  MDMB-CHMICA acts as a highly potent full agonist of the CB1 receptor with an efficacy of 94% and an EC50 value of 0.14 nM, which is approximately 8 times lower than the EC50 of JWH-018 (1.13 nM) and twofold lower than AB-CHMINACA (0.27 nM).  Metabolism  MDMB-CHMICA's main metabolic reactions comprise mono-hydroxylations and hydrolysis of the carboxylic ester function. In total, 31 metabolites could be identified in vivo.  Side effects  Seventy-one serious adverse events, including 42 acute intoxications and 29 deaths (Germany (5), Hungary (3), Poland (1), Sweden (9), United Kingdom (10), Norway (1)) that occurred in nine European countries between 2014 and 2016 have been associated with MDMB-CHMICA. Side effects such as unconsciousness or coma, hyperemesis, nausea, seizures, convulsions, tachycardia, bradycardia, mydriasis, syncope, spontaneous urinating and defecating, shortness of breath, somnolence, respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, collapse, lower limbs paralysis, chest pain, aggression and severe disturbance of behaviour were reported.  Legal status  In the United States, MDMB-CHMICA is a Schedule I controlled substance. MDMB-CHMICA is illegal in Austria, Canada, China, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Louisiana, Luxembourg, Norway, Turkey, the UK, Sweden and Switzerland. In August 2016 the European Commission proposed a ban on MDMB-CHMICA across the European Union. In 27 February 2017 the commission adopted an implementing act in banning MDMB- CHMICA, and Member States shall take the necessary measures to subject it to control measures and criminal penalties no later than by 4 March 2018.

He was a candidate for the 2016 Republican Party presidential nomination. He earned 154 delegates and won only one contest, his home state, Ohio. Kasich suspended his campaign on May 4, 2016, one day after becoming the last major challenger to Donald Trump for the nomination. Kasich vied to become the first Pennsylvania native to hold the office since James Buchanan in 1856, as well as the first from the city of Pittsburgh to do so. Background In 1982, Kasich ran for and was elected the U.S. Representative for Ohio's 12th Congressional District, defeating incumbent Democrat Bob Shamansky, and succeeded him in office on January 3, 1983. After twelve years in Congress, when Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, Kasich was appointed the Chairman of the United States House Committee on the Budget, beginning work at the start of the 104th Congress. As Chairman of the budget committee, Kasich took part in the crafting and passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which led to the first fiscal year without a deficit since 1969. In 1999, Kasich sought a bid for the Presidency in the Republican primaries of 2000, but withdrew prior to the primary season. Following his exit from Congress, Kasich hosted Heartland with John Kasich, a television talk show on the Fox News Channel, until his exit in April 2007. In 2001, Kasich joined Lehman Brothers' investment banking division as a managing director. He remained at Lehman Brothers until the firm declared bankruptcy in 2008. Lehman Brothers paid Kasich a $182,692 salary and $432,200 bonus in 2008. Kasich stated that the bonus was for work performed in 2007. In May 2009, Kasich announced his candidacy for Governor of Ohio, winning the Republican nomination, and defeating incumbent Governor Ted Strickland in the 2010 general election.Kasich names treasurer for 2010 campaign against Strickland In 2014, Kasich won his reelection for Governor in a landslide, winning 86 of the 88 Ohio counties against Democratic candidate Ed FitzGerald. Campaign On July 21, 2015, Kasich announced his candidacy for the presidency in 2016 at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. John Kasich campaign bus Kasich speaking at a town hall in New Hampshire Kasich speaking at Iowa State University in November 2015 Kasich had declared that his campaign would not be \\"getting people riled up about how bad everything is\\", but rather, he considered his campaign to be about \\"light and hope\\". According to Kasich, his campaign had deferred from attacks on other candidates. In the Republican debates, Kasich had some fiery exchanges with the front runner Donald Trump, especially concerning immigration reform and Trump's plan to deport all eleven million illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States. During the CNBC Republican debate, Trump accused Kasich of having struck luck with fracking and sitting on the board of Lehman Brothers' at the time of its bankruptcy. Trump furthered, \\"He was such a nice guy. And he said, Oh, I'm never going to attack. But then his poll numbers tanked. He's got ‚Äì that's why he's on the end ‚Äì and he got nasty. And he got nasty. So you know what? You can have him.\\" In the fourth GOP debate which was moderated by the Fox Business Network and The Wall Street Journal, Kasich, along with Jeb Bush, slammed Trump's plan. Kasich responded at one point, \\"It's a silly argument. It's not an adult argument. We all know you can't pick them up and ship them back across the border.\\" By the first week of January, Kasich had held his fiftieth town hall meeting in New Hampshire, more than any other presidential candidate in the state. A Monmouth University poll released on January 11 showed Kasich in second place in New Hampshire, tied with Ted Cruz, both with 14%. Explaining his rise to being tied for second place in New Hampshire, Kasich reasoned on January 12 that his increased numbers were due to him having substance and that he believed a victory in the state would give the Kasich campaign \\"momentum that could take us all the way to the nomination.\\" During the sixth debate, Kasich responded to a question pertaining to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, stating that the Republican nominee would \\"win every state\\" if he was the Democratic Party nominee and that based on him knowing Sanders, he could promise he \\"won't be president of the United States.\\" In mid-January, Kasich began to surge in some polls, leading journalist E. J. Dionne to speculate that Kasich might be filling a desire on the part of Republican \\"working-class voters who are economically pressed and looking for a champion,\\" but who seemed to prefer Kasich's \\"sunnier approach\\" to the \\"darker message[s]\\" coming from other Republican contenders. On January 25, he was endorsed for the Republican nomination by The Boston Globe and The New York Times. Kasich had a strong showing in New Hampshire, coming in second place, surprising many in the media and in politics. Chris Christie suspended his campaign the day after the race, with many of his supporters, including his top donor, going to Kasich. Kasich ended up in fifth place with 7.6% of the vote in South Carolina after Trump, Rubio, Cruz, and Bush. Bush suspended his campaign the day after the primaries, leaving Rubio and Kasich as the only \\"establishment\\" candidates left. Kasich came in fifth at the Nevada caucuses, with only 3.6% of the vote. On Super Tuesday, Kasich picked up a total of 21 delegates throughout eleven states. He finished second in both the states of Massachusetts and Vermont behind Trump with 18% and 30% of the vote respectively, but otherwise placed in single digits in the rest of the contests. In the period of time between Super Tuesday and the winner-take-all contest period, the governor was awarded 27 delegates from the states of Kansas (1) and Kentucky (5), and also narrowly finished third place in Michigan behind Ted Cruz, taking 17 delegates. On March 12, Kasich again narrowly placed second, this time behind Senator Marco Rubio in Washington, D.C. by 50 votes and collected 9 delegates. On March 15, Kasich won in his home state of Ohio, while Marco Rubio lost in his home state of Florida (to Trump) and withdrew from the race. Thus, Kasich was left with only two Republican primary opponents: Trump and Cruz. This caused Vox to declare that Kasich was the Republican \\"establishment's last best hope against Trump\\", while noting that \\"Kasich has positioned himself as the anti-Trump\\". However, on March 16, Kasich was mathematically eliminated from becoming the Republican Party's nominee, given that he had not won enough delegates in North Carolina, Illinois, or Missouri, all of which held their primaries the previous night. The following week on March 22, Kasich came in fourth place to Rubio's ghost in the Arizona primary, with Rubio edging out Kasich by nearly 18,000 votes. In April, Kasich campaigned in New York ahead of the state primary, where Trump led in polls by a significant margin. Kasich received an endorsement from New York Daily News on April 13. On April 14, Kasich received the endorsement of George Pataki, who called him the GOP's best chance to win the general election. It was the first endorsement Kasich had received from a former fellow candidate in the field. Later that day, Kasich attended a gala along with Trump and Cruz where he said, \\"I'm going to leave Cleveland as the nominee. Whether you believe it or not, it's going to happen.\\" In April 2016, the campaigns of Kasich and Ted Cruz agreed to \\"split up\\" some of the remaining primaries in an effort to block Donald Trump from gaining the 1,237 delegates necessary to clinch the GOP nomination. However, the pact proved challenging; for example, though Cruz was intended to focus on the Indiana primary, Kasich said that his supporters should still vote for him there. And days later, Cruz clarified that there is \\"no alliance\\" but, rather, he and Kasich \\"made a determination where to focus [the campaigns'] energies.\\" By May 2016, Trump had amassed a sizable lead of 996 delegates as compared with Cruz's 565 delegates and Kasich's 153 delegates. On May 3, after losing the Indiana primary, Cruz suspended his campaign and Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Reince Priebus stated that Trump will be the presumptive nominee. The next day, Kasich announced that he would also drop out, leaving Trump as the remaining candidate and presumptive nominee. In December, two faithless electors voted for Governor Kasich, however one was disallowed. A 2018 study on media coverage of the 2016 election noted \\"the paradox of the Kasich campaign‚Äôs longevity while it lacked public interest provides some evidence for the idea that Kasich‚Äôs biggest supporters were the media\\". Political positions Kasich has taken positions on a number of public policy issues during his tenure in Congress and as Governor of Ohio.

Kasich has put together a series of proposals aimed at changing the way the government finances itself and growing the economy. On the budget, he stated that he would work with Congress to put together a plan to balance the budget in eight years, supporting a balanced budget amendment. Kasich would increase the defense budget but freeze other non-discretionary spending. He would reform entitlements including raising the retirement age for eligibility for certain programs. He has laid out a specific outline predicting the revenue and spending for his tenure if he is president. Primary eve rally Robie's Country Store Hooksett, New Hampshire February 8, 2016 Kasich supported lowering tax rates for individuals and businesses along with simplifying the number of income tax brackets from seven to three and would implement a top tax rate of 28%. He supports reducing the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%. He supports doubling the tax credit for small businesses. He also supports reforming the Internal Revenue Service and reform regulations as president. He would implement a one-year moratorium for new regulations on businesses. He supports requiring Congress to implement cost-benefit analyses. He supports many reforms that would make it harder to implement \\"costly\\" regulations on businesses. He stated that he wants to \\"dismantle Washington\\" by turning over transportation, medicaid, education, and low income public assistance to the states. On energy, his goal is to become energy independent and has said he is open to all sources of energy. He says he will use \\"common sense\\" in energy regulations and supports new research in technologies. In 2014, Kasich had signed into a law SB 310, a bill that froze Ohio's renewable energy mandate for two years, making Ohio the first state to halt progress on its green energy goals. SB 310 removed the requirement, first set in 2008, for utilities to add renewables to their energy mix. Abortion Kasich opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood. As governor he prevented new dollars from going towards Planned Parenthood in Ohio. He supported streamlining the adoption process, but supported providing a funding stream for rape crisis centers so they could receive needed support and providers could receive training and technical assistance. He believes in exceptions for abortion in the cases of rape, incest, and/or the life of the mother. Kasich has been attacked by Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. Education Kasich believed that education power should be controlled at the state and local level instead of the federal level. Kasich says he opposes federal learning standards but believes states should create their own standards. He supported school choice, with Ohio having quadrupling the number of available vouchers and increased the number of schools whose students are eligible for vouchers.

He has said he is gun- owner, and in the 2014 election he was endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Kasich said that he opposes Barack Obama's executive order on gun control. As governor, he enacted legislation which removed restrictions on licensing requirements for hunters. Healthcare Kasich opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act though he did expand medicaid in his state under Obamacare. He says the United States should implement a system that has \\"patient-centered care, choices, market competition, decentralized decision-making, higher quality, respect for individuals and an end to Obamacare's big government interference\\". Social safety net He stated that due to him working in Congress and being Governor of Ohio, one has to make sure that when a President is set out to lift people up, they get the help they need and taxpayers get the value they deserve. He supported welfare reform and was a part of the team that introduced the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. He supported cutting taxes for low income families which he says he has done in Ohio in addition to increasing the earned income tax credit. He stated that part of criminal justice reform should be helping those addicted to drugs and the mentally ill.

Biography  Grant Faulkner was born and raised in Oskaloosa, Iowa. He earned a B.A. in English from Grinnell College and an M.A. in Creative Writing from San Francisco State University. He lives in Berkeley, California, with his wife, the writer Heather Mackey, and their two children.http://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/GrinMagFall13.web_.pdf#page=33 In 2011, Faulkner and Lynn Mundell co-founded 100 Word Story, an online literary journal that publishes stories that are exactly 100 words long. Stories published in 100 Word Story have been included on Wigleaf‚Äôs Top (Very) Short Fictions list and anthologized in the annual Best Small Fictions series and W.W Norton's New Micro: Exceptionally Short Fiction.http://queensferrypress.com/blog/tag/the-best-small-fictions/ In 2012, he became Executive Director of National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), taking over from founder Chris Baty. With more than 500,000 writers signing up to take part in NaNoWriMo‚Äôs programs annually, it‚Äôs the largest writing event in the world. NaNoWriMo emphasizes that everyone has a story to tell, and that everyone‚Äôs story matters. ‚ÄúHumans are naturally wired to tell stories because that‚Äôs how we make meaning of the world,‚Äù Faulkner said. ‚ÄúSo everyone has a story‚Äîor many stories‚Äîto tell. Everyone is a creative type by definition.‚Äù In 2014, Faulkner co-founded the Flash Fiction Collective, a reading series in San Francisco, with writers Jane Ciabattari and Meg Pokrass. In 2018, Faulkner launched the podcast \\"Write-minded: Weekly Inspiration for Writers\\" with co- host Brooke Warner of SheWrites.com.

In 2015, Faulkner released Fissures, a collection of one hundred 100-word stories, published by Press 53. One reviewer wrote, ‚ÄúIn Grant Faulkner‚Äôs collection of very short fiction, Fissures [One Hundred 100-Word Stories], Faulkner manages to elevate his language, presenting each word here with the rhetorical weight of a novel and with a poetic aptitude that is anything but self-indulgent. Faulkner has, instead, carefully crafted these stories, and each word comes at the reader as high currency.‚Äù The 100-word story form is often likened to prose poetry, which is one thing that drew Faulkner to the form. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always liked forms that blur,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo say that a piece of writing is a prose poem versus a story is just a matter of an author‚Äôs intention, an author‚Äôs definition.‚Äùhttp://blog.superstitionreview.asu.edu/2015/06/06/an-interview- with-grant-faulkner/ In 2018, he co-edited a collection of the best stories published in 100 Word Story, Nothing Short of 100: Selected Tales from 100 Word Story with Lynn Mundell and Beret Olsen.

Because of this, Gustavo was cut off from his family inheritance. Mia gets pregnant and Gustavo struggles to make a life for himself and his family. After Bella is born, Gustavo's parents visit them and tell Gustavo that they want him to come back. They are now willing to accept Gustavo's new family. Gustavo goes back to the company and works with his ex- girlfriend, Brenda, whom his parents still want for him. Brenda herself tells Mia that Gustavo is having an affair with her. Mia runs away with baby Bella and rides a boat to go to her sister who works at a resort. On the way, the boat hits an oil tanker which explodes. He follows the sailboat and tries to save Mia and Bella but only saves Mia. They were not able to find Bella anymore. On Isle Lululili, Bella gets the attention of a pearl hunter named Pancho Perez (Tommy Abuel). Then, Pancho approached Bella's stranded fishing boat. Pancho decides to take the baby to his wife, Cruz Perez. Eager to have children, they harbor the baby as a blessing. They call the child Marimar because they think of her arrival as a grace from the sea. Many years later, Marimar grew up and worked as a pearl hunter in order to sustain everyday life for her and her family. Becoming an working asset, Marimar once again dives for pearls. She sells her pearls all over the island, and with a wood cart as a stage, she dances her signature dance to get people‚Äôs attention. In this way, her dancing catches the glimpse of Sergio Santiba√±ez (Tom Rodriguez). A spoiled trust fund kid with devilishly good looks, unemployed and an indebted party boy. He wanted to get his inheritance from his father to pay off his loans. In order to get the inheritance, Sergio will marry a woman. But Antonia, Sergio's ex-girlfriend who still loves him - the daughter of his stepmom, Angelika is determined to marry Sergio. But Sergio doesn't like her anymore. So he wanted to bring Marimar from the island to his family and introduce her as his bride. They were married by fake marriage by a judge, but soon married for real in a church. Eventually, Sergio fell for Marimar. When Sergio left for a business project, Angelika plotted and made her assistant, Nicandro burn down Pancho and Cruz's seaside hut. Through Marimar's eyes, she thinks Sergio abandoned her because of the fake picture, letter, and lies that Angelika, Antonia, and Nicandro planned. Leaving an angry-hearted Marimar out for vengeance against the Santiba√±ez family. She decides to go find the former mayordoma of the Santiba√±ez hacienda and her close friend Corazon, who is now working in a jewelry manufacturer company after Angelika fired her. She entered the jewelry factory as well. When the boss of the company, Esperanza, found out that Marimar is pregnant, she tried to fire Marimar. But, she discontinued it after Marimar saved her from a fake pearl scam. Then, the strict and bad daughter of Esperanza, Innocencia (LJ Reyes), came when Marimar accidentally spilt the pearls when she was coming. Innocencia slipped and blamed Marimar even though she didn't plan it. Next came Mia, who unknown to Marimar was her mother. Innocencia was so jealous of Marimar's closeness with her Aunt Mia so she makes a plan to have Marimar fired. Afterwards, Marimar and Corazon saw that clients are available for the Aldama Luxury Group. The great and unique jewelry designed by Marimar becomes known when the boss, Gustavo sees the work of Marimar. He admires the impressive jewelry. It was also unknown to her that Gustavo was her real father until they both learned the fact that they are related as father and daughter. Styled, sent to school, and educated with well manners by Gustavo, his wife Brenda, and a family friend named Cappuccina. Marimar goes to Paris to work hard to be known as the rich, sophisticated Bella Aldama (Megan Young). In Paris, Bella gives birth prematurely to a baby girl whom she named Cruzita (Ashley Cabrera) after her Lola Cruz. She also vowed revenge against all who hurt her. After coming back to the Philippines, her revenge started. But as Sergio still believe it is Marimar, he stalked her all the time. Bella even say he's crazy but he doesn't care. In the day they were kidnapped, Sergio saved Bella where their lives get even closer. In the Santiba√±ez mansion, Nicandro and Angelika were having sex and caught by Renato (Ricardo Cepeda). Then Renato was shot in the head by Nicandro who was told to do so by Angelika. Meanwhile, Mia and Gustavo got back to each other and Bella was very happy. In the hospital, Renato miraculously survived the incident but was comatosed and he was being tried to kill by Nicandro but Sergio arrived and the crime did not get pushed through. Angelika's credit card were all denied so she could not buy a cake, then the gorgeous Bella Aldama whom Angelika did not know is Marimar arrived. Angelika wanted Bella to die so he asked Nicandro to plant a bomb in Bella's car. Accidentally, Mia and Gustavo were inside the car and they were the ones who died. Bella then accused her ex-step mother Brenda who ordered it. Bella knew that Brenda is not that bad to kill a person, when Angelika came in the funeral, she attacked Bella and got a scar in her face. Then Angelika plans revenge on Bella by telling Nicandro her evil plan. But Bella had also planned a big plan to bring Angelika down. She asked Rodolfo (James Blanco) to kidnap Nicandro. Nicandro has been tortured and forced to admit if he was the one who killed Mia and Gustavo and who asked him to do that evil plan. To be free, he tells Rodolfo that Angelika is the one. Meanwhile, The Santiba√±ez lose their money and Bella bought the Isla Santiba√±ez, Angelika's resort and named it to Isla Aldama. And as part of Bella's revenge, she also dropped the key of the resort on the mud and ask Angelika to get it just using her mouth in exchange of bringing the resort back to them. Bella did not bring it back to her still. In the other hand, Cappuccina (Solenn Heussaff) and Rodolfo broke up thinking that it's because of Bella. Capppuccina got drunk and accidentally told Antonia that Marimar and Bella is only one. Cruzita is getting closer to her tito and while she is sleeping, Corazon and Bella were talking about getting Cruzita far away from Sergio and Cruzita heard that her tito is her biological father. Cruzita escapes from the mansion and fell down into a hole then some men found her and brought her to the hospital. There, Cruzita and Sergio met once again. Sergio saw Fulgoso (Boobay) with Corazon which makes him approach Bella and while Sergio and Bella were talking to each other, she was forced by him to say that she and Marimar is only one because Sergio saw Natalia (Maricris Garcia), Choi (Mikoy Morales), Corazon, Padre Sito (Cris Villanueva), and now Fulgoso. As Bella was being forced, she can't hide the truth and revealed the fact. Meanwhile, Sergio already knows the truth about Angelika and Nicandros affair so he threw Angelika, Nicandro, Perfecta (Candy Pangilinan) and Antonia away. Angelika then went to Renato's room to say sorry to be his wife again so that they can have money to use but their plan did not work. Bella fakes the truth by going to another hospital but just in a different room, Sergio saw Corazon go to Cruzita's room. While Corazon was gone, Sergio meets Cruzita and she calls him daddy, then the truth was out. Bella tells Sergio that when she was still an island girl, Marimar, Angelika tortured her in the mansion. She gets mad at Sergio again and was betrayed by Antonia then told Sergio to get out of their lives forever. Angelika vowed revenge to Bella with the help of Nicandro, her affair. They planned to put a hole with a tiger inside it, but the plan fails. Angelika herself was the one who got bitten by the tiger, which caused her to lose her right hand. After that, Antonia got angry and now plans to revenge out of what Bella has done to Angelika, her mother. On the other hand, Rodolfo wants Bella back to her. But his plan fails when Sergio again proposed with Marimar, now as Bella Aldama. As the story continues, Antonia got pregnant and told Sergio that he is the father. She uses her baby to make Sergio back to him, but Bella did not let that happen. Antonia follows them to the mall to see Sergio. But Bella was the only one in the mall. Meanwhile, Bella and Antonia had an intense catfight until Antonia fall on the stairs. In that case, the doctor told them that Antonia is not really pregnant. All people are surprised because Antonia passed the pregnancy test and the doctor then told them that it's just an illusion pregnancy. After that, they kidnapped Cruzita just to revenge of what happen to her believing that they killed her \\"so-called imaginary baby\\". They got Cruzita back to them. Bella accidentally put the bomb on the helicopter Angelika and Antonia rides on. They thought the remote was with them and the bomb was left with the ground. But what they thought is a big BLUFF. The remote was left in the ground and the bomb was inside their helicopter. Fulgoso accidentally switched the remote on and caused the two to explode with the helicopter. The Santiba√±ez-Aldama wedding continued. And starting that, Marimar again become a Santiba√±ez, but this time, as Bella Aldama-Santiba√±ez.

The T2 tank never saw combat nor left prototype stages and was not mass-produced with only one built in 1930 by Rock Island Arsenal. Its legacy, however, was the M2 light tank, developed into the M2 medium, and onto the M3 Lee and M4 Sherman medium tanks.  Design  The design of the T2 was largely inspired by the British Vickers Medium Mark II and was later developed into the M2 light tank. When the T2 Medium Tank was built, its weight had to be reduced drastically because the US War Department had set a maximum weight of 15 tons. The T2 weighed only 14 tons when it was combat-loaded. The secondary armament was a 0.5 inch (12.7mm) machine gun and a 0.3 inch (7.62mm) machine gun at the front of the hull on the right; these were later replaced with a single 30 cal machine gun. The primary armament was a 47mm semi- automatic gun mounted on the turret and it initially had an additional 37mm cannon placed on the hull but that was abandoned in 1931. Only one T2 was produced; it is currently on display at Fort Lee, Virginia.http://preservedtanks.com/Types.aspx?TypeCategoryId=1210  References  Interwar tanks of the United States Medium tanks of the United States Abandoned military projects of the United States Trial and research tanks of the United States ","title":"T2 tank"},{"id":"47106359","text":"Tanzhou is a town situated at the southern extremity of the prefecture-level city of Zhongshan, Guangdong province.

It was advertised to be the world's highest capacity communications satellite with a throughput of 300 Gbit/s, succeeding HughesNet EchoStar XIX launched in December 2016. It is the second Ka-band satellite launched by ViaSat after ViaSat-1. The satellite provides internet service through ViaSat (Exede prior to rebranding) to North America, parts of South America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, and to air and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. History In May 2013, ViaSat gave the construction contract of the satellite to Boeing. On May 1, 2014 ViaSat sold capacity on the satellite to Xplornet Communications. In January 2015, ViaSat gave the launch contract to SpaceX in an uncontested auction. After SpaceX CRS-7 exploded after launch in June 2015, concerns arose that the investigation may affect the mission's launch window. On February 9, 2016 Arianespace announced it had won contracts to launch ViaSat-2 and ViaSat-3 in 2017 and 2019, respectively. ViaSat-2 was launched on June 1, 2017 by Arianespace from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. The launch date was originally set for April 25, 2017 but was delayed due to social unrest affecting the spaceport area. ViaSat-2 successfully arrived in geostationary orbit at 69.9 degrees west longitude on December 5, 2017. The satellite employed a hybrid propulsion approach, using both traditional chemical as well as electric propulsion. The chemical propulsion subsystem was responsible for initial orbit raising and performing according to plan, setting the state for the follow-on ascent to geostationary orbit using electric propulsion, which was completed the last week of November 2017. Viasat spacecraft partner, Boeing Satellite Systems International, controlled and monitored ViaSat-2 throughout the orbit raising process, flying the satellite from its Mission Control Center in El Segundo, California. Functionality The $600 million satellite was intended to have a 300 Gbit/s throughput, up from ViaSat-1's 140 Gbit/s in 2011. It uses Ka-band frequencies. Problems with two of the four Ka- band antennae, leading to a less optimal coverage pattern than designed have reduced throughput to 260Gbit/s See also * 2017 in spaceflight References Spacecraft launched in 2017 Communications satellites in geostationary orbit Satellite Internet access Satellites using the BSS-702 bus High throughput satellites Ariane commercial payloads ","title":"ViaSat-2"},{"id":"47106453","text":"Martin Karlsson may refer to: *Martin Karlsson (ice hockey, born 1952), Swedish ice hockey player and head coach *Martin Karlsson (ice hockey, born 1991), Swedish ice hockey player *Martin Karlsson (ice hockey, born 1996), Swedish ice hockey player ","title":"Martin Karlsson"},{"id":"47106502","text":"James Park Dawson Laurie (1846 ‚Äì 2 December 1928), generally known as \\"Park Laurie\\", was a pastoralist and politician in the colony of South Australia. History Park was born at Kangatong station, near Warrnambool, Victoria, the third son of the (Presbyterian) Rev. Alexander Laurie (c. 1817 ‚Äì 5 February 1854). The Rev. Laurie, of Covington, Lanarkshire, and his wife Janet Laurie, n√©e Nicol, (c. 1822 ‚Äì 25 July 1903) had been sent out to Portland, Victoria to establish a church there in 1841. In 1842 he founded a Presbyterian school, run by J. S. Stewart. In 1848 Rev. Laurie left the church and founded the Portland Herald, of which he was sole proprietor and editor, making a few enemies in the process. We await digitization of the Portland Herald to learn more! The Portland Herald and Belfast and Warrnambool Advocate (to give its full name) folded in 1855. Sons Andrew and Park were educated in Portland and later learnt much of the art of printing. The widowed Janet Laurie and her four sons moved to Gambierton (now Mount Gambier) and set about founding a newspaper, The Border Watch, whose first issue came out on 26 April 1861 as a 4-page, single broadsheet weekly. John Watson (ca.1842 ‚Äì 13 December 1925), another Scotsman and later Mount Gambier's first mayor, joined in 1863 as editor, and he and A. F. Laurie as publisher managed the company for the next 50 years. Park divested himself of his share of the newspaper around 1870 and took up pastoral leases Charkut Station and Laurie Park, and purchased Mailman Station on the Lower Darling, in partnership with his brother-in-law, A. McEdward, of Melbourne. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Victoria on two occasions and sat from 14 April 1870 to 6 December 1871 and 29 May 1873 to 21 February 1875. He had two colleagues for the first term: William Paltridge and (briefly) Neville Blyth. In his second stint his colleague was T. Wilde Boothby. In 1882 he married Dora Kean; they spent the next two years touring the world: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria, Turkey, Italy, England and America. On their return he purchased Tallageira station and built a new house there, where they lived for several years before moving to \\"Laurie Park\\" on the Mosquito Plains. He sold all his properties and lived in Naracoorte for a year or two, then took up land at Cadgee, where they lived for eighteen months before again returning to Naracoorte. When Kybybolite Station was subdivided he took up a block which he named \\"Eurinima\\", built a house and operated a mixed farm, living there until his death. Other interests He was admitted to the Mount Gambier Lodge of Freemasons shortly after its establishment in 1867, and was in 1925 its longest serving member. He was first elected to the Narracoorte District Council in 1889, and served for 35 years as a member, including 28 years as Chairman, retiring in 1929. He was keenly interested in horse racing, and an owner of several good jumpers. His Cuttlefish won the Oakbank Hurdle Race twice, and Guardfish which won the Warrnambool Grand National Hurdles Race and ran second in the Grand National Hurdle Race of 1885. His Echo won a number of flat races. He was for many years a steward and judge of the Narracoorte Racing Club. He died at the Naracoorte hospital, at 82 years, the then oldest ex-member of the South Australian House of Assembly. Family Children of Rev.

It may take forms including artistic pottery, including tableware, tiles, figurines and other sculpture. As one of the plastic arts, ceramic art is one of the visual arts. While some ceramics are considered fine art, as pottery or sculpture, most are considered to be decorative, industrial or applied art objects. Ceramics may also be considered artefacts in archaeology. Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture and decorate the art ware. Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as \\"art pottery\\". In a one- person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce studio pottery. The word \\"ceramics\\" comes from the Greek keramikos (Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±ŒºŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ), meaning \\"pottery\\", which in turn comes from keramos (Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±ŒºŒøœÇ) meaning \\"potter's clay\\".The Webster Encyclopedic Dictionary Most traditional ceramic products were made from clay (or clay mixed with other materials), shaped and subjected to heat, and tableware and decorative ceramics are generally still made this way. In modern ceramic engineering usage, ceramics is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes glass and mosaic made from glass tesserae. There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures, and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures, like that of the Nok in Africa over 2,000 years ago. Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the Chinese, Cretan, Greek, Persian, Mayan, Japanese, and Korean cultures, as well as the modern Western cultures. Elements of ceramic art, upon which different degrees of emphasis have been placed at different times, are the shape of the object, its decoration by painting, carving and other methods, and the glazing found on most ceramics.  Materials  Different types of clay, when used with different minerals and firing conditions, are used to produce earthenware, stoneware, porcelain and bone china (fine china). * Earthenware is pottery that has not been fired to vitrification and is thus permeable to water.\\"Earthenware\\" Britannica online Many types of pottery have been made from it from the earliest times, and until the 18th century it was the most common type of pottery outside the far East. Earthenware is often made from clay, quartz and feldspar. Terracotta, a type of earthenware, is a clay-based unglazed or glazed ceramic,OED, \\"Terracotta\\" where the fired body is porous.'Diagnosis Of Terra-Cotta Glaze Spalling.' S.E. Thomasen, C.L.

Its uses include vessels (notably flower pots), water and waste water pipes, bricks, and surface embellishment in building construction. Terracotta has been a common medium for ceramic art (see below). * Stoneware is a vitreous or semi-vitreous ceramic made primarily from stoneware clay or non-refractory fire clay.Standard Terminology of Ceramic Whiteware and Related Products: ASTM Standard C242. Stoneware is fired at high temperatures. Vitrified or not, it is nonporous; it may or may not be glazed.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Jasperware is unglazed stoneware One widely recognised definition is from the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities, a European industry standard states \\"Stoneware, which, though dense, impermeable and hard enough to resist scratching by a steel point, differs from porcelain because it is more opaque, and normally only partially vitrified. It may be vitreous or semi-vitreous. It is usually coloured grey or brownish because of impurities in the clay used for its manufacture, and is normally glazed.\\" * Porcelain is a ceramic material made by heating materials, generally including kaolin, in a kiln to temperatures between . The toughness, strength and translucence of porcelain, relative to other types of pottery, arises mainly from vitrification and the formation of the mineral mullite within the body at these high temperatures. Properties associated with porcelain include low permeability and elasticity; considerable strength, hardness, toughness, whiteness, translucency and resonance; and a high resistance to chemical attack and thermal shock. Porcelain has been described as being \\"completely vitrified, hard, impermeable (even before glazing), white or artificially coloured, translucent (except when of considerable thickness), and resonant\\". However, the term porcelain lacks a universal definition and has \\"been applied in a very unsystematic fashion to substances of diverse kinds which have only certain surface-qualities in common\\".Definition in The Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities defines, Burton, 1906 * Bone china (fine china) is a type of soft-paste porcelain that is composed of bone ash, feldspathic material, and kaolin. It has been defined as ware with a translucent body containing a minimum of 30% of phosphate derived from animal bone and calculated calcium phosphate. Developed by English potter Josiah Spode, bone china is known for its high levels of whiteness and translucency,Ozgundogdu, Feyza Cakir. \\"Bone China from Turkey\\" Ceramics Technical; May2005, Issue 20, p 29‚Äì32. and very high mechanical strength and chip resistance. Its high strength allows it to be produced in thinner cross- sections than other types of porcelain. Like stoneware it is vitrified, but is translucent due to differing mineral properties.What is China? As with stoneware, the body becomes vitrified; which means the body fuses, becomes nonabsorbent, and very strong. Unlike stoneware, china becomes very white and translucent. From its initial development and up to the later part of the twentieth century, bone china was almost exclusively an English product, with production being effectively localised in Stoke-on-Trent.'Trading Places.' R.Ware. Asian Ceramics. November,2009, p.35,37-39. Most major English firms made or still make it, including Mintons, Coalport, Spode, Royal Crown Derby, Royal Doulton, Wedgwood and Worcester. In the UK, references to \\"china\\" or \\"porcelain\\" can refer to bone china, and \\"English porcelain\\" has been used as a term for it, both in the UK and around the world.Osborne, Harold (ed), The Oxford Companion to the Decorative Arts, p. 130, 1975, OUP, ; Faulkner, Charles H., \\"The Ramseys at Swan Pond: The Archaeology and History of an East Tennessee Farm, p.96, 2008, Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2008, , 9781572336094; Lawrence, Susan, \\"Archaeologies of the British: Explorations of Identity in the United Kingdom and Its Colonies 1600‚Äì1945\\", p. 196, 2013, Routledge, , 781136801921 Fine china is not necessarily bone china, and is a term used to refer to ware which does not contain bone ash.  Surface treatments  Painted Capodimonte porcelain jar by (or in the style of) Giovanni Caselli with three figures of Pulcinella from the commedia dell'arte, 1745‚Äì1750. 16.2 cm high  Painting  China painting, or porcelain painting is the decoration of glazed porcelain objects such as plates, bowls, vases or statues. The body of the object may be hard-paste porcelain, developed in China in the 7th or 8th century, or soft-paste porcelain (often bone china), developed in 18th-century Europe. The broader term ceramic painting includes painted decoration on lead-glazed earthenware such as creamware or tin-glazed pottery such as maiolica or faience. Typically the body is first fired in a kiln to convert it into a hard porous biscuit. Underglaze decoration may then be applied, followed by ceramic glaze, which is fired so it bonds to the body. The glazed porcelain may then be decorated with overglaze painting and fired again at a lower temperature to bond the paint with the glaze. Decoration may be applied by brush or by stenciling, transfer printing, lithography and screen printing.Lewis, Florence (1883). China painting. Cassell.  Slipware  Slipware is a type of pottery identified by its primary decorating process where slip is placed onto the leather-hard clay body surface before firing by dipping, painting or splashing. Slip is an aqueous suspension of a clay body, which is a mixture of clays and other minerals such as quartz, feldspar and mica. A coating of white or coloured slip, known as an engobe, can be applied to the article to improve its appearance, to give a smoother surface to a rough body, mask an inferior colour or for decorative effect. Slips or engobes can also be applied by painting techniques, in isolation or in several layers and colours. Sgraffito involves scratching through a layer of coloured slip to reveal a different colour or the base body underneath. Several layers of slip and/or sgraffito can be done while the pot is still in an unfired state. One colour of slip can be fired, before a second is applied, and prior to the scratching or incising decoration. This is particularly useful if the base body is not of the desired colour or texture.Eden, Victoria and Michael. (1999) Slipware, Contemporary Approaches. A & C Black, University of Pennsylvania Press, G & B Arts International.  Terra sigillata  Ancient Roman pottery, mould-decorated terra sigillata bowl from Gaul (Metz in France) In sharp contrast to the archaeological usage, in which the term terra sigillata refers to a whole class of pottery, in contemporary ceramic art, 'terra sigillata' describes only a watery refined slip used to facilitate the burnishing of raw clay surfaces and used to promote carbon smoke effects, in both primitive low temperature firing techniques and unglazed alternative western-style Raku firing techniques. Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature glazed ceramic techniques.Garbsch, Jochen, Terra Sigillata. (1982) Ein Weltreich im Spiegel seines Luxusgeschirrs, Munich. (in German)  Forms   Studio pottery  Studio pottery is pottery made by amateur or professional artists or artisans working alone or in small groups, making unique items or short runs. Typically, all stages of manufacture are carried out by the artists themselves. Studio pottery includes functional wares such as tableware, cookware and non-functional wares such as sculpture. Studio potters can be referred to as ceramic artists, ceramists, ceramicists or as an artist who uses clay as a medium. Much studio pottery is tableware or cookware but an increasing number of studio potters produce non-functional or sculptural items. Some studio potters now prefer to call themselves ceramic artists, ceramists or simply artists. Studio pottery is represented by potters all over the world.  Tile  Upper part of the mihrab decorated with lusterware tiles (dating from the 9th century) in the Mosque of Uqba, Tunisia Tile, Hopi Pueblo (Native American), late 19th‚Äìearly 20th century A tile is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as ceramic, stone, metal, or even glass, generally used for covering roofs, floors, walls, showers, or other objects such as tabletops. Alternatively, tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as perlite, wood, and mineral wool, typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a \\"tile\\" is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see tile-based game). The word is derived from the French word tuile, which is, in turn, from the Latin word tegula, meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay. Tiles are often used to form wall murals and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex mosaics. Tiles are most often made of ceramic, typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, concrete and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate. Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.  Figurines  Group with lovers, modelled by Franz Anton Bustelli, Nymphenburg porcelain, 1756 A figurine (a diminutive form of the word figure) is a statuette that represents a human, deity, legendary creature, or animal. Figurines may be realistic or iconic, depending on the skill and intention of the creator. The earliest were made of stone or clay. In ancient Greece, many figurines were made from terracotta (see Greek terracotta figurines). Modern versions are made of ceramic, metal, glass, wood and plastic. Figurines and miniatures are sometimes used in board games, such as chess, and tabletop role playing games. Old figurines have been used to discount some historical theories, such as the origins of chess.  Tableware  Tableware is the dishes or dishware used for setting a table, serving food and dining. It includes cutlery, glassware, serving dishes and other useful items for practical as well as decorative purposes. Dishes, bowls and cups may be made of ceramic, while cutlery is typically made from metal, and glassware is often made from glass or other non-ceramic materials. The quality, nature, variety and number of objects varies according to culture, religion, number of diners, cuisine and occasion. For example, Middle Eastern, Indian or Polynesian food culture and cuisine sometimes limits tableware to serving dishes, using bread or leaves as individual plates. Special occasions are usually reflected in higher quality tableware.  Terracotta (artworks)  In addition to being a material, \\"terracotta\\" also refers to items made out of this material. In archaeology and art history, \\"terracotta\\" is often used to describe objects such as statures, and figurines not made on a potter's wheel. A prime example is the Terracotta Army, a collection of man-sized terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210209BCE and whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife. French sculptor Albert- Ernest Carrier-Belleuse made many terracotta pieces, but possibly the most famous is The Abduction of Hippodameia depicting the Greek mythological scene of a centaur kidnapping Hippodameia on her wedding day. American architect Louis Sullivan is well known for his elaborate glazed terracotta ornamentation, designs that would have been impossible to execute in any other medium. Terracotta and tile were used extensively in the town buildings of Victorian Birmingham, England.  History  There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures, and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures, like that of the Nok in Africa over 3,000 years ago.Breunig, Peter. 2014. Nok: African Sculpture in Archaeological Context: p. 21. Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the Chinese, Cretan, Greek, Persian, Mayan, Japanese, and Korean cultures, as well as the modern Western cultures. There is evidence that pottery was independently invented in several regions of the world, including East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, The Near East, and the Americas. Paleolithic pottery (c. 20,000 BP) Venus of Doln√≠ Vƒõstonice, before 25,000BCE 20,000-10,000 year old pottery with re-construction repairs found in the Xianrendong cave, China. Although pottery figurines are found from earlier periods in Europe, the oldest pottery vessels come from East Asia, with finds in China and Japan, then still linked by a land bridge, and some in what is now the Russian Far East, providing several from 20,00010,000BCE, although the vessels were simple utilitarian objects. Xianrendong Cave in Jiangxi province contained pottery fragments that date back to 20,000 years ago. These early pottery containers were made well before the invention of agriculture, by mobile foragers who hunted and gathered their food during the Late Glacial Maximum. Many of the pottery fragments had scorch marks, suggesting that the pottery was used for cooking. Before Neolithic pottery: stone containers (12,000‚Äì6,000 BC) Many remarkable containers were made from stone before the invention of pottery in Western Asia (which occurred around 7,000 BC), and before the invention of agriculture. The Natufian culture created elegant stone mortars during the period between 12,000 and 9,500 BC. Around 8000 BC, several early settlements became experts in crafting beautiful and highly sophisticated containers from stone, using materials such as alabaster or granite, and employing sand to shape and polish. Artisans used the veins in the material to maximize visual effect. Such object have been found in abundance on the upper Euphrates river, in what is today eastern Syria, especially at the site of Bouqras. These form the early stages of the development of the Art of Mesopotamia.

The potter's wheel was probably invented in Mesopotamia by the 4th millennium BCE, but spread across nearly all Eurasia and much of Africa, though it remained unknown in the New World until the arrival of Europeans. Decoration of the clay by incising and painting is found very widely, and was initially geometric, but often included figurative designs from very early on. So important is pottery to the archaeology of prehistoric cultures that many are known by names taken from their distinctive, and often very fine, pottery, such as the Linear Pottery culture, Beaker culture, Globular Amphora culture, Corded Ware culture and Funnelbeaker culture, to take examples only from Neolithic Europe (approximately 70001800BCE). Ceramic art has generated many styles from its own tradition, but is often closely related to contemporary sculpture and metalwork. Many times in its history styles from the usually more prestigious and expensive art of metalworking have been copied in ceramics. This can be seen in early Chinese ceramics, such as pottery and ceramic-wares of the Shang Dynasty, in Ancient Roman and Iranian pottery, and Rococo European styles, copying contemporary silverware shapes. A common use of ceramics is for \\"pots\\" - containers such as bowls, vases and amphorae, as well as other tableware, but figurines have been very widely made. Ceramics as wall decoration Hexagonal Tile, mid 15th centuryBrooklyn Museum The earliest evidence of glazed brick is the discovery of glazed bricks in the Elamite Temple at Chogha Zanbil, dated to the 13th century BCE. Glazed and coloured bricks were used to make low reliefs in Ancient Mesopotamia, most famously the Ishtar Gate of Babylon (), now partly reconstructed in Berlin, with sections elsewhere. Mesopotamian craftsmen were imported for the palaces of the Persian Empire such as Persepolis. The tradition continued, and after the Islamic conquest of Persia coloured and often painted glazed bricks or tiles became an important element in Persian architecture, and from there spread to much of the Islamic world, notably the ƒ∞znik pottery of Turkey under the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries. Using the lusterware technology, one of the finest examples of medieval Islamic use of ceramics as wall decoration can be seen in the Mosque of Uqba also known as the Great Mosque of kairouan (in Tunisia), the upper part of the mihrab wall is adorned with polychrome and monochrome lusterware tiles; dating from 862‚Äì863, these tiles were most probably imported from Mesopotamia.Catherine Hess, Linda Komaroff and George Saliba (2004), The arts of fire: Islamic influences on glass and ceramics of the Italian Renaissance, Getty Publications, p. 40 Transmitted via Islamic Spain, a new tradition of Azulejos developed in Spain and especially Portugal, which by the Baroque period produced extremely large painted scenes on tiles, usually in blue and white. Delftware tiles, typically with a painted design covering only one (rather small) tile, were ubiquitous in the Netherlands and widely exported over Northern Europe from the 16th century on. Several 18th-century royal palaces had porcelain rooms with the walls entirely covered in porcelain. Surviving examples include ones at Capodimonte, Naples, the Royal Palace of Madrid and the nearby Royal Palace of Aranjuez.Porcelain Room, Aranjuez Comprehensive but shaky video Elaborate cocklestoves were a feature of rooms of the middle and upper-classes in Northern Europe from the 17th to 19th centuries. There are several other types of traditional tiles that remain in manufacture, for example, the small, almost mosaic, brightly coloured zellige tiles of Morocco. With exceptions, notably the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, tiles or glazed bricks do not feature largely in East Asian ceramics. Regional developments Although pottery figurines are found from earlier periods in Europe, the oldest pottery vessels come from East Asia, with finds in China and Japan, then still linked by a land bridge, and some in what is now the Russian Far East, providing several from between 20,000 and 10,000 BCE, although the vessels were simple utilitarian objects. Xianrendong Cave in Jiangxi province contained pottery fragments that date back to 20,000 years ago. = Cambodia = Recent archaeological excavations at Angkor Borei (in southern Cambodia) have recovered a large number of ceramics, some of which probably date back to the prehistoric period. Most of the pottery, however, dates to the pre-Angkorian period and consists mainly of pinkish terracotta pots which were either hand- made or thrown on a wheel, and then decorated with incised patterns. Glazed wares first appear in the archaeological record at the end of the 9th century at the Roluos temple group in the Angkor region, where green-glazed pot shards have been found. A brown glaze became popular at the beginning of the 11th century and brown-glazed wares have been found in abundance at Khmer sites in northeast Thailand. Decorating pottery with animal forms was a popular style from the 11th to 13th century. Archaeological excavations in the Angkor region have revealed that towards the end of Angkor period production of indigenous pottery declined while there was a dramatic increase in Chinese ceramic imports. Direct evidence of the shapes of vessels is provided by scenes depicted on bas-reliefs at Khmer temples, which also offer insight into domestic and ritualistic uses of the wares. The wide range of utilitarian shapes suggest the Khmers used ceramics in their daily life for cooking, food preservation, carrying and storing liquids, as containers for medicinal herbs, perfumes and cosmetics. = China = Chinese Longquan celadon, Song Dynasty, 13th century. Celadon was first made in China, and then exported to various parts of Asia and Europe. Celadon became a favourite of various kings and monarchs, such as the Ottoman Sultans, because of its pristine beauty, its resemblance to Chinese jade, and the belief that the celadon would change its colour if the food or wine were poisoned.Britannica Online There is Chinese porcelain from the late Eastern Han period (100200CE), the Three Kingdoms period (220280CE), the Six Dynasties period (220589CE), and thereafter. China in particular has had a continuous history of large-scale production, with the Imperial factories usually producing the best work. The Tang Dynasty (618 to 906CE) is especially noted for grave goods figures of humans, animals and model houses, boats and other goods, excavated (usually illegally) from graves in large numbers. Some experts believe the first true porcelain was made in the province of Zhejiang in China during the Eastern Han period. Shards recovered from archaeological Eastern Han kiln sites estimated firing temperature ranged from .He Li, (1996). Chinese Ceramics. The New Standard Guide. Thames and Hudson, London. . As far back as 1000 BCE, the so-called \\"porcelaneous wares\\" or \\"proto-porcelain wares\\" were made using at least some kaolin fired at high temperatures. The dividing line between the two and true porcelain wares is not a clear one. Archaeological finds have pushed the dates to as early as the Han Dynasty (206BCE220CE).Temple, Robert K.G. (2007). The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention (3rd edition). London: Andr√© Deutsch, pp. 103‚Äì6. The Imperial porcelain of the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279), featuring very subtle decoration shallowly carved by knife in the clay, is regarded by many authorities as the peak of Chinese ceramics, though the large and more exuberantly painted ceramics of the Ming Dynasty (13681644) have a wider reputation. Chinese emperors gave ceramics as diplomatic gifts on a lavish scale, and the presence of Chinese ceramics no doubt aided the development of related traditions of ceramics in Japan and Korea in particular. Until the 16th century, small quantities of expensive Chinese porcelain were imported into Europe. From the 16th century onwards attempts were made to imitate it in Europe, including soft-paste and the Medici porcelain made in Florence. None was successful until a recipe for hard-paste porcelain was devised at the Meissen factory in Dresden in 1710. Within a few years, porcelain factories sprung up at Nymphenburg in Bavaria (1754) and Capodimonte in Naples (1743) and many other places, often financed by a local ruler. = Japan = Nabeshima plate with three herons A celadon incense burner from the Goryeo Dynasty with Korean kingfisher glaze. National Treasure No.95 of South Korea The earliest Japanese pottery was made around the 11th millennium BCE. J≈çmon ware emerged in the 6th millennium BCE and the plainer Yayoi style in about the 4th century BCE. This early pottery was soft earthenware, fired at low temperatures. The potter's wheel and a kiln capable of reaching higher temperatures and firing stoneware appeared in the 3rd or 4th centuries CE, probably brought from China via the Korean peninsula.The Metropolitan Museum of Art \\"Although the roots of Sueki reach back to ancient China, its direct precursor is the grayware of the Three Kingdoms period in Korea.\\" In the 8th century, official kilns in Japan produced simple, green lead-glazed earthenware. Unglazed stoneware was used as funerary jars, storage jars and kitchen pots up to the 17th century. Some of the kilns improved their methodsmil From the 11th to the 16th century, Japan imported much porcelain from China and some from Korea. The Japanese overlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi's attempts to conquer China in the 1590s were dubbed the \\"Ceramic Wars\\"; the emigration of Korean potters appeared to be a major cause. One of these potters, Yi Sam-pyeong, discovered the raw material of porcelain in Arita and produced first true porcelain in Japan. In the 17th century, conditions in China drove some of its potters into Japan, bringing with them the knowledge to make refined porcelain. From the mid-century, the Dutch East India Company began to import Japanese porcelain into Europe. At this time, Kakiemon wares were produced at the factories of Arita, which had much in common with the Chinese Famille Verte style. The superb quality of its enamel decoration was highly prized in the West and widely imitated by the major European porcelain manufacturers. In 1971 it was declared an important \\"intangible cultural treasure\\" by the Japanese government. In the 20th century, interest in the art of the village potter was revived by the Mingei folk movement led by potters Shoji Hamada, Kawai Kajiro and others. They studied traditional methods in order to preserve native wares that were in danger of disappearing. Modern masters use ancient methods to bring pottery and porcelain to new heights of achievement at Shiga, Iga, Karatsu, Hagi, and Bizen. A few outstanding potters were designated living cultural treasures (mukei bunkazai ÁÑ°ÂΩ¢ÊñáÂåñË≤°). In the old capital of Kyoto, the Raku family continued to produce the rough tea bowls that had so delighted connoisseurs. At Mino, potters continued to reconstruct the classic formulas of Momoyama-era Seto-type tea wares of Mino, such as Oribe ware. By the 1990s many master potters worked away from ancient kilns and made classic wares in all parts of Japan. = Korea = Korean pottery has had a continuous tradition since simple earthenware from about 8000 BCE. Styles have generally been a distinctive variant of Chinese, and later Japanese, developments. The ceramics of the Goryeo Dynasty (918‚Äì1392) and early Joseon white porcelain of the following dynasty are generally regarded as the finest achievements.  Western Asia and the Middle East  = Islamic pottery = Cup with votive inscriptions in Kufic script. Terracotta, Nishapur (Tepe Madraseh)Metropolitan Museum of Art collections From the 8th to 18th centuries, glazed ceramics was important in Islamic art, usually in the form of elaborate pottery, Mason (1995), p. 1 developing on vigorous Persian and Egyptian pre-Islamic traditions in particular. Tin-opacified glazing was developed by the Islamic potters, the first examples found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating from about the 8th century. The Islamic world had contact with China, and increasingly adapted many Chinese decorative motifs. Persian wares gradually relaxed Islamic restrictions on figurative ornament, and painted figuratives scenes became very important. Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze, Gorgan, 9th century CE, Early Islamic period, National Museum of Iran Stoneware was also an important craft in Islamic pottery, produced throughout Iraq and Syria by the 9th century.Mason (1995), p. 5 Pottery was produced in Raqqa, Syria, in the 8th century. Other centers for innovative ceramics in the Islamic world were Fustat (near modern Cairo) from 975 to 1075, Damascus from 1100 to around 1600 and Tabriz from 1470 to 1550.Mason (1995), p. 7 The albarello form, a type of maiolica earthenware jar originally designed to hold apothecaries' ointments and dry drugs, was first made in the Islamic Middle East. It was brought to Italy by Hispano-Moresque traders; the earliest Italian examples were produced in Florence in the 15th century. Iznik pottery, made in western Anatolia, is highly decorated ceramics whose heyday was the late 16th century under the Ottoman sultans. Iznik vessels were originally made in imitation of Chinese porcelain, which was highly prized. Under S√ºleyman the Magnificent (1520‚Äì66), demand for Iznik wares increased. After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultans started a programme of building, which used large quantities of Iznik tiles. The Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul (built 1609‚Äì16) alone contains 20,000 tiles and tiles were used extensively in the Topkapi Palace (commenced 1459). As a result of this demand, tiles dominated the output of the Iznik potteries.  Europe  = Early figurines = The earliest known ceramic objects are the Gravettian figurines from the Upper Paleolithic period, such as those discovered at Doln√≠ Vƒõstonice in the modern- day Czech Republic. The Venus of Doln√≠ Vƒõstonice (Vƒõstonick√° Venu≈°e in Czech) is a statuette of a nude female figure dating from some time from 29,00025,000 BCE. It was made by moulding and then firing a mixture of clay and powdered bone.Chris Stringer. Homo Britannicus, Alan Lane, 2006, . Similar objects in various media found throughout Europe and Asia and dating from the Upper Paleolithic period have also been called Venus figurines. Scholars are not agreed as to their purpose or cultural significance. = The ancient Mediterranean = Hellenistic Tanagra figurine of BCE, probably just intended to represent a fashionable lady with a sun-hat Glazed Egyptian faience dates to the third millennium BCE), with painted but unglazed pottery used even earlier during the predynastic Naqada culture. Faience became sophisticated and produced on a large scale, using moulds as well modelling, and later also throwing on the wheel. Several methods of glazing were developed, but colours remained largely limited to a range in the blue-green spectrum. On the Greek island of Santorini are some of the earliest finds created by the Minoans dating to the third millennium BCE, with the original settlement at Akrotiri dating to the fourth millennium BCE; excavation work continues at the principal archaeological site of Akrotiri. Some of the excavated homes contain huge ceramic storage jars known as pithoi. Ancient Greek and Etruscan ceramics are renowned for their figurative painting, especially in the black-figure and red-figure styles. Moulded Greek terracotta figurines, especially those from Tanagra, were small figures, often religious but later including many of everyday genre figures, apparently used purely for decoration. Ancient Roman pottery, such as Samian ware, was rarely as fine, and largely copied shapes from metalwork, but was produced in enormous quantities, and is found all over Europe and the Middle East, and beyond. Monte Testaccio is a waste mound in Rome made almost entirely of broken amphorae used for transporting and storing liquids and other products. Few vessels of great artistic interest have survived, but there are very many small figures, often incorporated into oil lamps or similar objects, and often with religious or erotic themes (or both together ‚Äì a Roman speciality). The Romans generally did not leave grave goods, the best source of ancient pottery, but even so they do not seem to have had much in the way of luxury pottery, unlike Roman glass, which the elite used with gold or silver tableware. The more expensive pottery tended to use relief decoration, often moulded, rather than paint. Especially in the Eastern Empire, local traditions continued, hybridizing with Roman styles to varying extents. = Tin-glazed pottery = A Hispano-Moresque dish, approx diameter, with Christian monogram \\"IHS\\", decorated in cobalt blue and gold lustre. Valencia, 1500. Burrell Collection Ming Dynasty (13681644 CE) blue- and-white porcelain dish from the reign of the Jiajing Emperor (15211567 CE)Nanjing Museum collections Tin-glazed pottery, or faience, originated in Iraq in the 9th century, from where it spread to Egypt, Persia and Spain before reaching Italy in the Renaissance, Holland in the 16th century and England, France and other European countries shortly after. Important regional styles in Europe include: Hispano-Moresque, maiolica, Delftware, and English Delftware. By the High Middle Ages the Hispano-Moresque ware of Al-Andaluz was the most sophisticated pottery being produced in Europe, with elaborate decoration. It introduced tin-glazing to Europe, which was developed in the Italian Renaissance in maiolica. Tin-glazed pottery was taken up in the Netherlands from the 16th to the 18th centuries, the potters making household, decorative pieces and tiles in vast numbers,Caiger-Smith, Alan, Tin Glazed Pottery, Faber and Faber, 1973 usually with blue painting on a white ground. Dutch potters took tin-glazed pottery to the British Isles, where it was made between about 1550 and 1800. In France, tin-glaze was begun in 1690 at Quimper in Brittany,Faience-de-quimper.com followed in Rouen, Strasbourg and Lun√©ville. The development of white, or near white, firing bodies in Europe from the late 18th century, such as Creamware by Josiah Wedgwood and porcelain, reduced the demand for Delftware, faience and majolica. Today, tin oxide usage in glazes finds limited use in conjunction with other, lower cost opacifying agents, although it is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters,'Ceramic Glazes.'

Oxford. 1986. including Picasso who produced pottery using tin glazes. = Porcelain = Until the 16th century, small quantities of expensive Chinese porcelain were imported into Europe. From the 16th century onwards attempts were made to imitate it in Europe, including soft-paste and the Medici porcelain made in Florence. In 1712, many of the elaborate Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets were revealed throughout Europe by the French Jesuit father Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles and soon published in the Lettres √©difiantes et curieuses de Chine par des missionnaires j√©suitesBaghdiantz McAbe, Ina (2008). Orientalism in Early Modern France. Oxford: Berg Publishing, p. 220. ; Finley, Robert (2010). The pilgrim art. Cultures of porcelain in world history.

Cambridge University Press, p. 36-7. After much experimentation, a recipe for hard- paste porcelain was devised at the Meissen porcelain factory in Dresden soon after 1710, and was on sale by 1713. Within a few decades, porcelain factories sprung up at Nymphenburg in Bavaria (1754) and Capodimonte in Naples (1743) and many other places, often financed by a local ruler. Soft-paste porcelain was made at Rouen in the 1680s, but the first important production was at St.Cloud, letters-patent being granted in 1702. The Duc de Bourbon established a soft-paste factory, the Chantilly porcelain, in the grounds of his Ch√¢teau de Chantilly in 1730; a soft-paste factory was opened at Mennecy; and the Vincennes factory was set up by workers from Chantilly in 1740, moving to larger premises at S√®vres in 1756. The superior soft-paste made at S√®vres put it in the leading position in Europe in the second half of the 18th century. The first soft-paste in England was demonstrated in 1742, apparently based on the Saint-Cloud formula. In 1749 a patent was taken out on the first bone china, subsequently perfected by Josiah Spode. The main English porcelain makers in the 18th century were at Chelsea, Bow, St James's, Bristol, Derby and Lowestoft. Porcelain was ideally suited to the energetic Rococo curves of the day. The products of these early decades of European porcelain are generally the most highly regarded, and expensive. The Meissen modeler Johann Joachim Kaendler and Franz Anton Bustelli of Nymphenburg are perhaps the most outstanding ceramic artists of the period. Like other leading modelers, they trained as sculptors and produced models from which moulds were taken. By the end of the 18th century owning porcelain tableware and decorative objects had become obligatory among the prosperous middle-classes of Europe, and there were factories in most countries, many of which are still producing. As well as tableware, early European porcelain revived the taste for purely decorative figures of people or animals, which had also been a feature of several ancient cultures, often as grave goods. These were still being produced in China as blanc de Chine religious figures, many of which had reached Europe. European figures were almost entirely secular, and soon brightly and brilliantly painted, often in groups with a modelled setting, and a strong narrative element (see picture). = Wedgwood and the North Staffordshire Potteries = Neoclassical Wedgwood urn in jasperware, From the 17th century, Stoke- on-Trent in North Staffordshire emerged as a major centre of pottery making. Important contributions to the development of the industry were made by the firms of Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Doulton and Minton. The local presence of abundant supplies of coal and suitable clay for earthenware production led to the early but at first limited development of the local pottery industry. The construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal allowed the easy transportation of china clay from Cornwall together with other materials and facilitated the production of creamware and bone china. Other production centres had a lead in the production of high quality wares but the preeminence of North Staffordshire was brought about by methodical and detailed research and a willingness to experiment carried out over many years, initially by one man, Josiah Wedgwood. His lead was followed by other local potters, scientists and engineers. Wedgwood is credited with the industrialization of the manufacture of pottery. His work was of very high quality: when visiting his workshop, if he saw an offending vessel that failed to meet with his standards, he would smash it with his stick, exclaiming, \\"This will not do for Josiah Wedgwood!\\" He was keenly interested in the scientific advances of his day and it was this interest that underpinned his adoption of its approach and methods to revolutionize the quality of his pottery. His unique glazes began to distinguish his wares from anything else on the market. His matt finish jasperware in two colours was highly suitable for the Neoclassicism of the end of the century, imitating the effects of Ancient Roman carved gemstone cameos like the Gemma Augustea, or the cameo glass Portland Vase, of which Wedgwood produced copies. He also is credited with perfecting transfer-printing, first developed in England about 1750. By the end of the century this had largely replaced hand-painting for complex designs, except at the luxury end of the market, and the vast majority of the world's decorated pottery uses versions of the technique to the present day. The perfecting of underglaze transfer printing is widely credited to Josiah Spode the first. The process had been used as a development from the processes used in book printing, and early paper quality made a very refined detail in the design incapable of reproduction, so early print patterns were rather lacking in subtlety of tonal variation. The development of machine made thinner printing papers around 1804 allowed the engravers to use a much wider variety of tonal techniques which became capable of being reproduced on the ware, much more successfully. Far from perfecting underglaze print Wedgwood was persuaded by his painters not to adopt underglaze printing until it became evident that Mr Spode was taking away his business through competitive pricing for a much more heavily decorated high quality product. Stoke-on-Trent's supremacy in pottery manufacture nurtured and attracted a large number of ceramic artists including Clarice Cliff, Susie Cooper, Lorna Bailey, Charlotte Rhead, Frederick Hurten Rhead and Jabez Vodrey. = Studio pottery in Britain = Studio pottery is made by artists working alone or in small groups, producing unique items or short runs, typically with all stages of manufacture carried out by one individual. It is represented by potters all over the world but has strong roots in Britain, with potters such as Bernard Leach, William Staite Murray, Dora Billington, Lucie Rie and Hans Coper. Bernard Leach (1887‚Äì1979) established a style of pottery influenced by Far-Eastern and medieval English forms. After briefly experimenting with earthenware, he turned to stoneware fired to high temperatures in large oil- or wood-burning kilns. This style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th-century. The Austrian refugee Lucie Rie (1902‚Äì1995) has been regarded as essentially a modernist who experimented with new glaze effects on often brightly coloured bowls and bottles. Hans Coper (1920‚Äì1981) produced non-functional, sculptural and unglazed pieces. After the Second World War, studio pottery in Britain was encouraged by the wartime ban on decorating manufactured pottery and the modernist spirit of the Festival of Britain. The simple, functional designs chimed in with the modernist ethos. Several potteries were formed in response to this fifties boom, and this style of studio pottery remained popular into the nineteen-seventies.Harrod, Tanya, \\"From A Potter's Book to The Maker's Eye: British Studio Ceramics 1940‚Äì1982\\", in The Harrow Connection, Northern Centre for Contemporary Art, 1989 Elizabeth Fritsch (1940-) took up ceramics working under Hans Coper at the Royal College of Art (1968‚Äì1971). Fritsch was one of a group of outstanding ceramicists who emerged from the Royal College of Art at that time. Fritschs' ceramic vessels broke away from traditional methods and she developed a hand built flattened coil technique in stoneware smoothed and refined into accurately profiled forms. They are then hand painted with dry matt slips, in colours unusual for ceramics. = Pottery in Germany = German pottery has its roots in the alchemistry laboratories searching for gold production. * Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin * Meissen porcelain * Nymphenburg porcelain * Hutschenreuther = Pottery in Austria = In 1718 a pottery was founded in Vienna. = Pottery in Russia = The Imperial Porcelain Manufacture was founded in 1744 in Oranienbaum, Russia. It was based on the invention of porcelain by D. I. Winogradow (independent from B√∂ttgers invention 1708, Dresden). An important collection of antique porcelain is preserved in the Russian Museum of Ceramics.  The Americas  Zuni olla, 19th century, artist unknownStanford Museum collections Anasazi mugs from the Four Corners area, Southwestern US. Note the T-shaped cut-out in the left mug's handle. Ancestral Puebloan doorways often have this same shape. = Native American pottery = The people in North, Central, and South America continents had a wide variety of pottery traditions before Europeans arrived. The oldest ceramics known in the Americasmade from 5,000 to 6,000 years agoare found in the Andean region, along the Pacific coast of Ecuador at Valdivia and Puerto Hormiga, and in the San Jacinto Valley of Colombia; objects from 3,800 to 4,000 years old have been discovered in Peru. Some archaeologists believe that ceramics know-how found its way by sea to Mesoamerica, the second great cradle of civilization in the Americas.The New York Times, Art Review Museum of American Indian's 'Born of Clay' Explores Culture Through Ceramics By GRACE GLUECK, Published: 1 July 2006 The best- developed styles found in the central and southern Andes are the ceramics found near the ceremonial site at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar (800400BCE) and Cupisnique (1000400BCE). During the same period, another culture developed on the southern coast of Peru, in the area called Paracas. The Paracas culture (600100BCE) produced marvelous works of embossed ceramic finished with a thick oil applied after firing. This colorful tradition in ceramics and textiles was followed by the Nazca culture (1600CE), whose potters developed improved techniques for preparing clay and for decorating objects, using fine brushes to paint sophisticated motifs. In the early stage of Nazca ceramics, potters painted realistic characters and landscapes. The Moche cultures (1800CE) that flourished on the northern coast of modern Peru produced modelled clay sculptures and effigies decorated with fine lines of red on a beige background. Their pottery stands out for its huacos portrait vases, in which human faces are shown expressing different emotionshappiness, sadness, anger, melancholyas well for its complicated drawings of wars, human sacrifices, and celebrations.Born of Clay ‚Äì Ceramic from the National Museum of the American Indian, 2005 Smithsonian Institution The Maya were relative latecomers to ceramic development, as their ceramic arts flourished in the Maya Classic Period, or the 2nd to 10th century. One important site in southern Belize is known as Lubaantun, that boasts particularly detailed and prolific works. As evidence of the extent to which these ceramic art works were prized, many specimens traced to Lubaantun have been found at distant Maya sites in Honduras and Guatemala.C.M. Hogan, Comparison of Mayan sites in southern and western Belize, Lumina Technologies (2006) Furthermore, the current Maya people of Lubaantun continue to hand produce copies of many of the original designs found at Lubaantun. In the United States, the oldest pottery dates to 2500BCE. It has been found in the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve in Jacksonville, Florida, and some slightly older along the Savannah River in Georgia. The Hopi in Northern Arizona and several other Puebloan peoples including the Taos, Acoma, and Zu√±i people (all in the Southwestern United States) are renowned for painted pottery in several different styles. NampeyoA Nampeyo Showcase , a display of some of Nampeyo's work and her relatives created pottery that became highly sought after beginning in the early 20th century. Pueblo tribes in the state of New Mexico have styles distinctive to each of the various pueblos (villages). They include Santa Clara Pueblo, Taos Pueblo, Hopi Pueblos, San Ildefonso Pueblo, Acoma Pueblo and Zuni Pueblo, amongst others. Some of the renowned artists of Pueblo pottery include: Nampeyo, Elva Nampeyo, and Dextra Quotskuyva of the Hopi; Leonidas Tapia of San Juan Pueblo; and Maria Martinez and Julian Martinez of San Ildefonso Pueblo. In the early 20th century Martinez and her husband Julian rediscovered the method of creating traditional San Ildefonso Pueblo Black-on Black pottery. = Mexican ceramics = Talavera serving tray Mexican ceramics are an ancient tradition. Precolumbian potters built up their wares with pinching, coiling, or hammer-an-anvil methods and, instead of using glaze, burnished their pots. = Studio pottery in the United States = There is a strong tradition of studio artists working in ceramics in the United States. It had a period of growth in the 1960s and continues to present times. Many fine art, craft, and contemporary art museums have pieces in their permanent collections. Beatrice Wood was an American artist and studio potter located in Ojai, California. She developed a unique form of luster-glaze technique, and was active from the 1930s to her death in 1998 at 105 years old. Robert Arneson created larger sculptural work, in an abstracted representational style. There are ceramics arts departments at many colleges, universities, and fine arts institutes in the United States.  Sub-Saharan Africa  It appears that pottery was independently developed in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 10th millennium BC, with findings dating to at least 9,400 BC from central Mali, Simon Bradley, A Swiss-led team of archaeologists has discovered pieces of the oldest African pottery in central Mali, dating back to at least 9,400BC , SWI swissinfo.ch ‚Äì the international service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SBC), 18 January 2007 Pottery in Sub-Saharan Africa is traditionally made by coiling and is fired at low temperature. The figurines of the ancient Nok culture, whose function remains unclear, are an example of high-quality figural work, found in many cultures, such as the Benin of Nigeria. In the A√Ør Region of Niger (West Africa) (Haour 2003) pottery dating from around 10,000 BCE was excavated. Ladi Kwali, a Nigerian potter who worked in the Gwari tradition, made large pots decorated with incised patterns. Her work is an interesting hybrid of traditional African with western studio pottery. Magdalene Odundo is a Kenyan-born British studio potter whose ceramics are hand built and burnished.  Ceramics museums and museum collections  A ceramics museum is a museum wholly or largely devoted to ceramics, normally ceramic artworks, whose collections may include glass and enamel as well, but will usually concentrate on pottery, including porcelain. Most national ceramics collections are in a more general museum covering all the arts, or just the decorative arts, but there are a number of specialized ceramics museums, some concentrating on the production of just one country, region or manufacturer. Others have international collections, which may concentrate on ceramics from Europe or East Asia, or have global coverage. In Asian and Islamic countries ceramics are usually a strong feature of general and national museums. Also most specialist archaeological museums, in all countries, have large ceramics collections, as pottery is the commonest type of archaeological artifact.\\"Archaeological Analysis\\", Ohio State Archeological excavations in Greece Most of these are broken shards however. Outstanding major ceramics collections in general museums include The Palace Museum, Beijing, with 340,000 pieces, and the National Palace Museum in Taipei city, Taiwan (25,000 pieces); both are mostly derived from the Chinese Imperial collection, and are almost entirely of pieces from China. In London, the Victoria and Albert Museum (over 75,000 pieces, mostly after 1400 CE) and British Museum (mostly before 1400 CE) have very strong international collections. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and Freer Gallery of Art in Washington DC (12,000, all East AsianPeterson, 403) have perhaps the best of the many fine collections in the large city museums of the United States. The Corning Museum of Glass, in Corning, New York, has more than 45,000 glass objects.

On 17 July, YPG-led forces captured all of the roads and villages surrounding Al-Hasakah, fully besieging the ISIL militants remaining inside of the city. On 28 July, YPG-led forces and the Syrian Army expelled ISIL from most of Al-Hasakah, with two ISIL pockets persisting near the Al-Zuhour District and the southern entrance. On 1 August, the city was fully cleared of ISIL fighters. Background On 30 May 2015, after ISIL forces suffered a collapse in the western Al-Hasakah province, they launched an offensive on the Syrian government-held portion of Al-Hasakah city. Although the Kurdish YPG initially stayed out of the conflict, they eventually joined the conflict on 5 June, after ISIL reached the southern gate of the city, after a decision that the YPG would be recognized as a primary combatant force in the city. On 8 June 2015, ISIL was pushed back from Al-Hasakah city, and Syrian Army forces were able to establish a 12 kilometer (7.46 mi) buffer zone around the southern portion of Al-Hasakah city. The battle ISIL offensive assault On 23 June, three or four ISIL suicide bombers targeted a Syrian Army security compound, a military checkpoint near a children's hospital, and a YPG police station in the Kurdish-held part of the city. Ten Syrian government soldiers were killed in the attacks. Two days later, ISIL began an assault on the Syrian government-held parts of the city, after detonating an VBIED near a checkpoint at the southern entrance, seizing the al-Nashwa and al-Shari'ah neighborhoods, the children's hospital, and the education college. Later, the Syrian Army brought in reinforcements in an attempt to counter the offensive, while ISIL detonated a second suicide car bomb. On 26 June, ISIL managed to enter the southeastern parts of the city, while at least 20 Syrian Army soldiers were killed after ISIL detonated two VBIEDs at the criminal security building, resulting in the destruction of large parts of it. On the same day, ISIL forces launched an assault on Syrian government-held areas to the east of the Kurdish held Abd al-Aziz Mountains, capturing territory from the village of Abyad to the south of Al-Harmalah, west of Al-Hasakah city. On 27 June, the YPG was engaged in the battle for Al- Hasakah city, as it supported local Syrian government forces near al-Villat al-Homr, on the outskirts of the Ghuweran neighborhood. Despite Republican Guard reinforcements, ISIL advanced further into the city on that day. The Syrian Army launched a counterattack, after 400 Republican Guard soldiers from Deir Ezzor were deployed to Al-Hasakah, while the Asayish declared a curfew over the city. The Syrian Army reportedly recaptured the Al-Liliyah district and the eastern corridor of the Al-Nishwa District. On 28 June, ISIL made new gains, capturing the Ghuweran stadium, and the Aziziya and Al-Ghazal Districts. On the following day, Syrian government forces advanced towards the al-Nashwa District, after calling in new reinforcements, and reportedly recaptured the Ghuweran District later on that day. At least 12 Syrian Army soldiers were killed by three suicide bombers, while 9 ISIL militants were killed. The Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia claimed ISIS had fired \\"makeshift chemical projectiles\\" containing poison gas at areas in the city of Al-Hasakah, and at YPG positions south of the town of Tel Brak to the northeast of Hasakah city. On 29 June, Syrian state TV claimed that Syrian government troops had recaptured the al-Nashwa district, while the SOHR confirmed they managed to seize parts of al-Nashwa but that fighting around the area continued. A Damascus security source also confirmed fighting continued in the district. Later on that day, the pro-Syrian government Al Masdar News reported that the Syrian Army recaptured the Ghuweran Stadium. Syrian Army/YPG counterattack Over the next two days, the Syrian Army managed to recapture most of the areas seized by the ISIL militants. In addition, the YPG reportedly expelled ISIL from al-Aziziyah and took control of the neighbourhood and the nearby villages of Maruf and Hamra. On 1 July, the Syrian Army brought in new reinforcements, while two VBIEDs were detonated inside the city, as ISIL renewed its attack on the Ghuweran district. The next day, ISIL regained ground in a city neighborhood. On 3 July, 11 Syrian Army soldiers were killed and wounded by an ISIL suicide bomber in the city. On the same day, ISIL advanced to the Khabur River in southwestern Al-Hasakah city, reaching the Kurdish and Assyrian-held part of northern Al-Hasakah. By then, ISIL had deployed over 4,500 militants into Al-Hasakah city. By 5 July, YPG forces stationed to the east of the Abd al-Aziz Mountains launched an offensive eastward, capturing multiple villages that ISIL had captured from Syrian Army forces, in an attempt to sever an ISIL supply line to Al-Hasakah city. The US-led Coalition also conducted two airstrikes near the highway, in support of the YPG advance. On 8 July, the Syrian Army units reportedly established full control over the al-Lailiyeh neighborhood in Al-Hasaka city. On 10 July, ISIL captured the Faculty of Economics, on the southern outskirts of the city, but part of it was recaptured by the Syrian Army later in the day. The Syrian Army also reportedly captured the southeastern part of the Al- Nishwa District. On 10 July, ISIL militants captured the military housing to the east of the Al-Zuhour neighborhood, fully besieging the Syrian Army forces in the juvenile prison and the power plant to the south of Al-Hasakah city. Around the same time, YPG forces to the south of Al-Harmalah had advanced eastward to the Abyad Bridge, capturing it, and severing a section of an ISIL supply route, to the south of Al-Hasakah's Al-Nishwa District. On 13 July, ISIL captured the Al-Ahdath Prison, in the southern countryside of the city, after besieging it for one week. 23 NDF and SAA soldiers were killed and 11 missing during a breakout attempt, while 37 SAA soldiers managed to reach Syrian government lines. On 14 July, the Syrian Army announced it had concluded the first phase of military operations inside the provincial capital of Al-Hasakah, and had now entered the second phase. The first phase consisted of forestalling ISIL's progress in Al-Hasakah city. The goal of the second phase was to recapture the west district of the Al-Nishwa Quarter, along with the remaining territory in the Al-Zuhour Quarter under ISIL's control (i.e. the Panorama Roundabout). The goal of the third and final phase was to recapture the villages surrounding Al-Hasakah City, in order to build another buffer zone to prevent the encroaching combatants of ISIL from re-entering. ISIL surrounded and expelled On 17 July, YPG captured the Al-Ahdath Prison as well as a power plant, from ISIL, in an action that effectively encircled the 1,200 remaining ISIL combatants in the city. YPG fighters had also taken control of the villages formerly controlled by the Syrian Army to the west of Al-Hasakah city, leaving the Syrian Army in control of only central Al-Hasakah city. This left ISIL fully besieged in Al-Hasakah city in 2 separate pockets, in the Nashwa, Al-Zuhour, and Abu Bakr neighborhoods, in the south and the southeast of Al-Hasakah city. By 20 July, the Syrian Army also expelled ISIL fighters from the Ghuweran district. On 21 July, SOHR reported that 13 ISIL fighters had been killed in SAAF airstrikes. Simultaneously, YPG reportedly advanced, capturing Al-Watwatiyah and the rural area north of Tal Tanaynir as well as some farms north of Bab Al-Khayr. NDF and Gozarto also gained some territory, capturing three building blocks in the Al-Shari'ah neighborhood. ISIL forces were reportedly now fully besieged inside Al- Hasakah. By 23 July, Kurdish forces and their Syriac allies were largely in control of the city, having recaptured their own areas, as well as areas previously held by the Syrian Government, from ISIL, as well as controlling most of the access points into the city. That day, YPG and allies advanced towards al-Melbiyyeh regiment, as well as taking parts of Western al-Nashweh neighborhood. Meanwhile, government troops also advanced in the Ghwyran neighborhood. At the end of the day, ISIL retreated towards the Shar'iah neighborhood, while the YPG and Syrian government forces made new gains in the city. On 24 July, it was also reported that the ISIL leadership in Al-Shaddadi had abandoned a plan to rescue the besieged ISIL forces in Al-Hasakah city, after two vehicle bomb attacks were stopped by the YPG at Al-Dawudiyah and Al- Salaliah. By 25 July, Kurdish and allied forces had seized the western al- Nashweh neighborhood and reached the outskirts of Shar'iah neighborhood, while also reaching Filastin Street in the city center. Meanwhile, Syrian government forces advanced around the Gweiran Sport City. On 26 July, the SOHR reported that Syrian government forces had managed to isolate the ISIL units in the southern Al-Hasakah city, separating the contingents battling the YPG in western al-Neshwa from the units fighting Syrian government forces in the al- Zuhour neighborhood, in the southern part of Al-Hasakah city. Hundreds of civilian refugees who had previously fled the battle were now reportedly beginning to return to their homes.http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/07/civilians-of-hasakah-city-come-back- to-their-homes ISIL control of the city was reduced to 10%, with Syrian government forces controlling 20%, and the Kurdish forces and their allies now expanding their control to most of the city, with them controlling the remaining 70%. Later on that same day, the SOHR reported that ISIL was close to defeat in Al-Hasakah city, with their presence reduced to a pocket of resistance in the neighborhood of al-Zuhour, in southern Al-Hasakah city. The recent days of conflict had left at least 271 ISIL fighters dead.http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/07/islamic-state-defeated-in-the-battle- of-abo-sahl-al-ordoni-in-al-hasakah/ On July 28, it was reported that ISIL had finally been defeated after the YPG and government forces managed to seize al- Zuhour, which killed 31 ISIL fighters. A few remaining ISIL militants were said to be trapped inside the west district of the Al-Nishwa Quarter, with all available supply lines breached and nowhere to escape. Later on 28 July, the Al-Zuhour District was nearly cleared by YPG and Syrian Army forces, resulting in the remaining ISIL militants being pushed to the southern outskirts of the city. On 29 July, the US-led Coalition conducted two airstrikes on ISIL positions near Al-Hasakah city. On 30 July, there were still two ISIL pockets at the southern entrance of the city and in the Al-Zuhour District. The remaining ISIL militants tried to entrench themselves inside buildings near the Youth Housing Camp, but were subjected to further assaults, with 20 fighters killed by YPG forces. The remaining ISIL fighters were thus left with an ultimatum to \\"surrender or die\\". Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and eight others wounded after ISIL launched an attack on the southern part of Hasakah city. By 31 July, Syrian government forces had made further advances against ISIL. By the next day, the number of killed ISIL fighters since 28 July had reached 25. Clashes continued in the southern suburbs until 1 August, and later on that day, the city was reportedly secured from ISIL, after their last stronghold in the al-Zuhor district was captured by SAA/YPG forces. On the same day, the YPG and the SAA released press statements stating that they had fully secured the city from ISIL. The YPG also stated that the nearest ISIL positions to Al-Hasakah city had been pushed back to a distance of from the city suburbs. Aftermath The situation about a year after the Battle of Al-Hasakah (2015), in August 2016. The battle against ISIL left several districts of Al-Hasakah city in ruins, due to the massive bombing and shelling. On 3 August, Syrian government sources confirmed that the city had been fully cleared of ISIL fighters. The sources also stated that the Syrian government and the YPG had now begun negotiations for redistributing contested territories seized by either side during the battle. Thus far, negotiations had resulted in the Syrian government handing control of a school over to the YPG. On the night of 3 August, YPG-led forces captured farmland from ISIL near the village of Rajman, to the southeast of Al-Hasakah city, in a clearing operation. On 11 August, the US-led Coalition conducted an airstrike on a village east of Al-Hasakah city, blowing up a building that ISIL was using for a meeting, which killed over 50 ISIL militants. On 12 August, ISIL reportedly publicly shot and executed more than 90 of its own members as punishment for escaping the battlefield. ISIL claimed that the fighters' desertion was the main cause of ISIL's loss at the Battle of Al-Hasakah. It was reported on 16 August that ISIL had executed four more of its own fighters, for allegedly collaborating with the CJTF‚ÄìOIR Coalition.

Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187 (1991), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States establishing that private sector policies prohibiting women from knowingly working in potentially hazardous occupations are discriminatory and in violation of Title VII and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978.. The case revolved around Johnson Controls' policy of excluding fertile women from working in battery manufacturing jobs because batteries contain high amounts of lead, which entails health risks to people's reproductive systems (both men and women) and fetuses. At the time the case was heard, it was considered one of the most important sex-discrimination cases since the passage of Title VII. Opinion of the Court The majority opinion by Justice Blackmun held that that Title VII prohibits gender‚Äìspecific fetal protection policies. Hence based on that statute, the Court decided against Johnson Controls by concluding that the company‚Äôs fetal protection policy contravened Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the PDA; and the company's gender-specific rule was biased and inequitable because it permitted fertile men, but not fertile women, to decide whether to work in jobs subjected to lead exposure while manufacturing batteries.

Between 1967 and 1989 he was a member of the Party Central Committee. Life Hermann P√∂schel was born in Zeitz a few weeks after the formal ending of the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19. Zeitz was a small industrial town in the south of Prussia (today near the southern tip of Saxony-Anhalt). Sources describe P√∂schel's father as an \\"unskilled worker\\" (\\"ungelernter Arbeiter\\"). The boy left school in 1935 and embarked on an industrial apprenticeship. In 1938 he progressed to the Technical Academy in Magdeburg where he remained till 1940. From a German perspective, war returned in 1939 which opened up employment opportunities in defence related sectors of the economy, and in 1940, the year of his twenty- first birthday, Hermann P√∂schel took a job in Dessau as a research engineer with the Junkers Aircraft Company. He stayed with Junkers till 1945. War ended in May 1945 with Dessau now included in the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of Germany. P√∂schel was employed in industry as a fitter, as a foreman and as a section leader. The outbreak of peace also ended the Nazi regime and, as it seemed, signalled an end to one-party dictatorship. In 1945 Hermann P√∂schel joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The next year, however, in April 1946 the authorities prepared the way for a return to one- party government with the contentious merger, in the Soviet occupation zone, of the SPD with what till then was the Communist Party. P√∂schel was one of many thousand members of the \\"old\\" parties who lost no time in signing their party memberships over to the new Socialist Unity Party (SED). After that, between 1946 and 1950 he was employed as a technical director in the Publicly owned Baby buggy enterprise in Zeitz. In October 1949 the Soviet occupation zone was reinvented as the German Democratic Republic, a Soviet sponsored separate version of Germany with its constitutional arrangements modeled, increasingly overtly, on those of the Soviet Union itself. 1951 Hermann P√∂schel undertook a study period at the Regional Party Academy, which was the route to a political career. After that, briefly, he was employed as a department head in the state government of Saxony-Anhalt. Between 1952 and 1953 he worked for the regional council of the newly created Halle region (the southern 40% of Saxony-Anhalt). In 1953 he switched from regional government to a national post with the ruling Sociality Unity Party (SED) where he became an instructor in the Mechanical engineering department of the Party Central Committee. The country's constitutional arrangements, based on those created by Lenin for the Soviet Union, placed stress on the \\"leading role\\" of the ruling party. Government ministers carried out party decisions, and the Party Central Committee was the party's controlling element (except when a Party Congress was in session). Working for the central committee therefore placed P√∂schel at the heart of the East German power structure. In 1954 he was promoted from the position of instruction to that of section leader, and in 1956 he was made deputy head of department. Between 1958 and 1961 he headed up the Central Committee's Working Commission on Research, Technological development and Investment policy. After that he became, in 1961, head of the Central Committee Department for Research and Technological Development. It was a function he would retain till 1989, his 28-year tenure was the second longest achieved by any of the thirteen departmental heads reporting in to the Central Committee. In 1963 P√∂schel's own name appeared on the candidate list for membership of the Party Central Committee. After a conventional wait, in 1967 Hermann P√∂schel became one of the (by this time) 131 Central Committee members. Once on the committee, like most of its members, he remained a member until the end of 1989 which was when the Central Committee dissolved itself as one of a succession of events which amounted to the demise of the German Democratic Republic as a standalone state and led, in October 1990, to German reunification. During the 1970s The Party became increasingly troubled by the abundance of black-market articles (silk scarves, women's sweaters, denim clothing, gas lighters, LPs, chewing gum and lollipops) from Poland appearing in East Germany. A fellow Central Committee member, Hermann Axen was mandated to research counter-measures to be undertaken against black-marketeering, while P√∂schel was given the task of identifying how the goods in question could be produced and sourced from the country's own factories. On 26 May 1981 P√∂schel was appointed a member of the influential Cadre Commission of the Party Central Committee. The Commission, which dealt with personnel decisions, comprised a handful of departmental chiefs along with the First Secretary, Erich Honecker, himself.

The premature fusion of cranial sutures named craniosynostosis, it is ‚Äúsimple‚Äù when only one cranial suture is involved and ‚Äúcompound‚Äù when two or more cranial sutures are involved. Metopism is the opposite of craniosynostosis. The main factor of the metopic suture is to increase the volume of the anterior cranial fossa. The frontal bone includes the forehead, and the roofs of the orbits (bony sockets) of the eyes. The frontal bone has vertical portion (squama) and horizontal portion (orbital part). Some adults have a metopic or frontal suture in the vertical portion. In uterine period in right and left half of frontal region of the fetus there is a membrane tissue. On each half a primary ossification center appears about the end of the second month of the fetus. Primary ossification center extends to form the corresponding half of the vertical part (squama) and horizontal part (orbital part) of the frontal bone. At birth the frontal bone contains two portions, separated by the metopic (frontal) suture. Metopism is the condition of having a persistent metopic suture. Metopic suture is regularly obliterated, except at its lower part, by the eighth year, but infrequently persists throughout life. There is no single proven cause of metopism. The occurrence is from mild to serious situations. Visional, learning, and behavioral problems may happen in serious metopism. Some don't need any medical treatment. Surgery is a successful approach for those who need it. Treatment teams include: neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, neurologists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, audiologists, neuroscience nursing professionals, speech therapists, physical therapists, dentist, otolaryngologists, ophthalmologists, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers.

(C.L.A.S.S.A.) The airline was established in 1928 as a result of the aim of the military dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera of having a greater state-controlled Spanish airline monopolizing air transport. As had been done with CAMPSA and with CTNE, a monopoly made up by merging the existing aviation companies in Spain was presented as a desirable goal in the general interest. CLASSA's inaugural flight took place on 27 May 1929 between Getafe (Madrid) and Sevilla. This airline, which ceased operations in the second year of the Spanish Republic, earned a positive reputation for not having had a single air accident during its existence. History CLASSA was an airline founded during General Primo de Rivera's dictatorship. It was established together with the Higher Aeronautic Council (Consejo Superior de Aeron√°utica) by virtue of a decree issued on 9 April 1927 ‚Äîthe explicit aim of the newly created council being to unify all existing civil airlines. This aim reflected General Primo de Rivera's policy of establishing monopolies strongly intervened by the state to run the basic public services of the nation. Following a decree issued on 9 January 1928 by the military government, the creation of a new airline was put out to tender and two proposals were presented. The companies that were merged in order to form CLASSA were Iberia, Uni√≥n A√©rea Espa√±ola (U.A.E.), Compa√±√≠a Espa√±ola de Tr√°fico A√©reo (C.E.T.A.)Histaer - C.E.T.A.

Madrid: Aeropuertos Espa√±oles y Navegaci√≥n A√©rea, S.A., ed. Historia de los Aeropuertos de Madrid (I). . and the airship line Transa√©rea Col√≥n. The companies that had a contract with the government at that time, such as Compa√±√≠a A√©rea Jorge Loring, were exempt from joining as long as their government contract was still in force. The new airline was formally constituted as a company on 13 March 1929, with the full name Compa√±√≠a de L√≠neas A√©reas Subvencionadas, Sociedad An√≥nima, but it soon would be widely known by its acronym 'CLASSA'. The newly formed airline would officially begin full operation of the lines flown by the previous companies on 25 November 1929. However, it was decided that the official date of its constitution would be 25 May 1929, which was the date in which CLASSA took over all the rights and obligations, including the fleets and staff of the companies that had been merged. The Compa√±√≠a Espa√±ola de Tr√°fico A√©reo (C.E.T.A.), a pioneer Spanish airline that had been founded in 1920, ceased to exist after the official date of establishment of CLASSA. The only exception was the Sevilla - Granada flight by U.A.E. that would be continued to be operated by this company until January 1930. On that date the remaining two Junkers G 24 used by U.A.E. to operate that line ‚Äîone had been transferred to CLASSA the previous year‚Äî joined CLASSA's fleet.Histaer - Uni√≥n A√©rea Espa√±ola (U.A.E.) U.A.E had sold all its CLASSA shares to Jorge Loring on 24 May 1929, by which Loring became the main de facto shareholder of the new company. Compa√±√≠a A√©rea Jorge Loring's Sevilla - Tetu√°n - Larache line would be taken over by CLASSA on 31 January 1931, date in which Compa√±√≠a A√©rea Jorge Loring in turn ceased to exist.Histaer - Compa√±√≠a A√©rea Jorge Loring In May 1930 CLASSA made the historical first commercial flight to the Canary Islands using one of its Ford 4-AT trimotors, the only plane of the fleet that had a radio on board.Primer vuelo comercial a Canarias The plane landed on 20 May at Los Rodeos Airport (now Tenerife Norte) in Tenerife Island. Following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 LAPE (L√≠neas A√©reas Postales Espa√±olas), the airline that would replace CLASSA became established. On 23 September 1931 the contract between CLASSA and the Spanish government was declared void. LAPE began operations in April 1932, CLASSA flying under the Spanish Republican Flag for one year, following which its fleet and other assets were merged with LAPE's.Alas de la Rep√∫blica : CLASSA , LAPE (1934) After the airline was wrapped up the republican government of Spain compensated all of CLASSA's shareholders.

Robert Bryant, Duke University's Professor of Mathematics and the president of the American Mathematical Society (2015-2017) was a student of his. He is better known in the United States for his improvements and popularization of the methods of √âlie Cartan (most notably, Cartan's equivalence method, an algorithmic procedure for determining if two geometric shapes are different). The works of Cartan were hard to grasp for most students, and Gardner worked to explain them in more accessible ways. Biography He was born on February 27, 1939. Gardner graduated from Princeton University in 1959, earned a master's degree from Columbia University in 1960, and completed his PhD in 1965 from the University of California, Berkeley, under the orientation of Shiing-Shen Chern. After this, he worked at many places, including becoming a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, and some years as assistant professor at Columbia University. He joined the faculty of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1971 and became a full professor there in 1977. He died on May 5, 1998.

They are currently the only Military School in Southern Africa to formally present IEDD (Improvised Explosive Device Demolition). History Origin In 1946, an Engineer Training Wing was established at what was then the Military College, now the SA Army College. In 1964, the post of GSO2 Engineers was filled full- time by a Regular Force Officer. In 1948, the Wing was moved to Potchefstroom, where it became the Engineer Wing of the SA Army Artillery and SA School of Armour. In 1968, it was transferred to Kroonstad as the Engineer Training Centre. In 1969, it became the School of Engineers. Insignia =Previous insignia= SADF era Engineer School insignia Curriculum  South African Engineer Corps Training Training Basic skills of military engineers are taught to all students, which is focused on combat: *Mine warfare. * Basic Field Engineering. * Use of Power tools. * Obstacles and Defense works. *Water purification. * Water provision. * Watermanship. *Bridge building. *Demolitions. These modules are spread over 16 weeks of intensive training. Recruits arrive in September from their Basic Military Training at Infantry School where they are qualified as Infanteers and graduate in December, inducted into the Sappers family. 2nd phase Military Engineering Training (Specialization) Recruits, who are now referred to as Sappers are then assigned to the following units for the various types of engineering disciplines: *2 Field Engineer Regiment: (based in Bethlehem), to become Combat Engineers, who will now specialise in-depth in all modules trained on during the 1st phase along with Engineer Paratooper training as well as Battle handling amongst specialities. *1 Construction Regiment: (based in Nigel), to be further trained in the field of Civil Engineering, Artisans, Technicians, Construction Machine Operations as well as Operational Project Management. *Engineer Terrain Intelligence Regiment: (based in Pretoria), they are trained and developed in various disciplines with regards to Geospatial Intelligence, Government Communications Information Systems (GCIS), Mapping and Survey, Environmental Analysis, Printing Services, Photography as well as other related functions. *35 Engineer Support Regiment: (based in Nigel), this unit is the support unit of the Engineer Corps as it manages all the equipment and inventory of the Corp. Recruits attached to this unit will be trained in the packaging, servicing, administration and utilization of all Engineer equipment. They are qualified as drivers of all everything that has wheels or is operable. *44 Parachute Engineer Regiment: (currently in Nigel), this regiment is currently under revitalization and is for recruits who have qualified and completed Parachute training at 44 Parachute Regiment. They are trained to infiltrate hostile operational areas by air to undertake rapid engineer tasks, serve as a reaction force to combat engineers and a force multiplier to the Infantry. The unit is currently a reserve unit. Combat Engineering South African Combat Engineering includes: =Constructing Infrastructure= The construction of roads, bridges, field defence and obstacles, water points, helipad construction, route reconnaissance, and erecting communication =Demolition of Infrastructure= Rigging, the use of explosives for the carrying out of demolitions, obstacle clearance and assault of fortifications. =Water Assault= Use of assault boats in obstacle crossings. Operational Construction Construction sappers are responsible for establishment of operational infrastructure for the South African Army, i.e. operational bases, roads and airfields. Functions include: * Architectural * Civil Engineering * Electrical Services * Builders * Carpenters * Electricians * Plumbers Other training The School of Engineers runs about 100 training courses and many of the skills taught are directly relevant to the national economy. Trades taught and employed by include: *Bricklaying, *Carpentry, *Construction machine operation, *Draughting, *Electricians, *Geographic information specialists, *Surveying and *Welding. Specific courses * Corps Training Course (701 ENGR 006): designed to equip a field sapper with the general military engineering skills and knowledge to obtain the main objective of engineering, namely survivability of own forces, general engineer tasks and denial of enemy mobility. This learning programme is presented to members with the rank of sapper and is the foundation course for all engineer officers. * Troop Officers Course (701 ENGR 103): designed to train combat engineers who have been selected by the Engineer Formation Officers Selection Board for officer training at the SAEC. This training ensures that combat engineers could be utilised in posts as troop officers in the Field Engineer Regiment, and, during operational conditions, within the Field Squadron. On successful completion, the learner has to plan and execute field engineer tasks, such as terrain analysis, at sub-unit or squadron level. The learner has to function as a troop officer and to assist the troop commander of the SAEC at sub-sub- unit level. * Troop Commanders Course (701 ENGR 16): designed as a part of the training programme for all SAEC officers with the rank of lieutenant in the disciplines required to act as troop commanders in the SAEC. These members are required to have completed the SAEC Troop Officers Course successfully in order to be accepted for this course. Upon successful completion of this learning programme, learners are able to plan and execute all combat engineer tasks and to gather information during reconnaissance as part of the responsibility of troop commander within the engineer squadron. The learner is equipped to act as an SO3 engineer and to function in a compartment of a formation. * Squadron Commanders Course (701 ENGR 17): designed to train SAEC officers with the rank of captain. The aim of this programme is to ensure that SAEC captains can be utilised in posts as SAEC squadron commanders in the Field Engineer Regiment, and prepare them for the integrated Sub-Unit Commanders Course. The members are required to have completed the SAEC Troop Officers Course, the advanced bridge-building course and the equipment orientation course successfully in order to be accepted for this course. Upon successful completion of this, the learner would have been able to act as a Field Section Leader in the Field Engineer Regiment during operations.
