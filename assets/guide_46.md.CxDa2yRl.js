It is an 11-story building with retail space on its ground floor and 10 residential units, one on each floor, for a total of . Della Valle + Bernheimer of Brooklyn was the architect. To ensure that its design was built as intended, the architects developed the property themselves, which also saved time and money on construction, important during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, through Alloy Development, a subsidiary. They chose to have it sheathed in black composite and white glass, delineated by an irregularly shaped boundary on the building's upper stories meant to call attention to complex local zoning requirements. After it was finished in 2008, the building was quickly occupied as buyers, including CNBC anchor Simon Hobbs, were drawn by the nearby presence of the newly opened High Line. The year afterward it earned Architect magazine's Annual Design Review Award for Multi-Family Housing. Building The building is located on a L-shaped lot on the north side of West 18th Street a short distance east of the intersection with 10th Avenue, in the West Chelsea neighborhood. All the nearby blocks are characterized by dense urban development with multistory mixed-use buildings. The terrain is generally sloping up very gradually to the east from the Hudson River to the west. Most of the buildings in the area are of late 19th or 20th-century construction, such as the two adjoining 459 to its west, and the commercial building across the street. There are, however, some other 21st-century buildings by notable architects in the neighborhood. On the immediate east is the 2009 Chelsea Modern by Audrey Matlock. Frank Gehry's 2007 IAC Building is located a block to the west at the 11th Avenue intersection, with Jean Nouvel's 100 Eleventh Avenue just to its north on the corner with 19th Street. Between it and 459 the High Line elevated linear park crosses 18th Street. The building itself is a steel frame high-rise with concrete plank floors. Its 11 stories are faced in sheets of composite and opaque glass over aluminum panels. At street level the main entrance has a small roof covering ingress to its lobby and the retail space there. Its lower five stories occupy its full footprint. The facing on them is black composite, with fenestration consisting of tall strip windows, some , with two-inch () mullions concealing the venting, on the south face. At the sixth floor the glass on the eastern side is white, with a diagonal divide between it and the black panels continuing to the next story where it ends at a small roof taking up the building's southwest corner. Above it the remaining three stories are all white, with the space above the roof opening up at a matching angle. On the roof the top of the elevator shaft and the hardware are all black.See accompanying photo. Inside, the ground-floor space is currently occupied by an art gallery. The stories above are given over to one residential unit each from , with wide wood plank flooring and marble slabs. All have custom-designed Italian kitchens and bathrooms, along with the large windows. History Jared Della Valle, one of the principals of Della Valle + Bernheimer, a small architectural firm based in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Dumbo, bought the property in 2006 along with one of his firm's clients, Katherine McConvey, for $5 million. Two years later, they were able to secure $19 million in financing from United Commercial Bank (UCB). The two planned to develop it from the start, and formed a company, Alloy Development LLC, in order to do so. The project faced some unusual constraints. Its lot was L-shaped, deep on the east side but only on the west. In addition the neighborhood was subject to special zoning restrictions. There were also economic constraints related to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. UCB failed in 2009. Two of the apartment buyers reneged on their original agreements to purchase, although the ultimate outcome was beneficial to the developer. The builders were able to adapt to those limitations. As both architect and developer, Della Valle was able to amend the design in ways that both made it cheaper to build but preserved the original design concept. The New York Times later reported that this shortened construction by four or five months. Seen in 2017 Construction itself was made as cost-effective as possible to further assuage the concerns of lenders in a difficult economy, using the CM at-risk model. Most parts were prefabricated. The building's windows were produced in China, then set in the facade panels by a company in Calverton, on Long Island, and then shipped to the site on flatbed trucks. According to Della Valle, one had merely 1 inches () of overhead clearance when it crossed the Manhattan Bridge, leading the fabricators to say they would never build such large panels again. They were fully applied in two weeks. When construction finished in 2008, at a final cost of $12 million, the builders were able to offer competitively priced residential units for the upscale neighborhood that was expected to sprout up around the High Line, set to open in the next year. They knew Nouvel's building nearby, a strong draw for the same buyers, would soon be completed as well. \\"Our goal was to deliver a true three-bedroom, and we aimed to cost $50 per square foot less than everybody else on the block,\\" Della Valle told the Times in 2009, at which point they had sold seven of the apartments. He believed they had met that expectation. Within the first year, all the apartments had sold in the range of $2.5‚Äì3.8 million. Among the early occupants was CNBC anchor Simon Hobbs, who moved into a two-bedroom unit in 2010. Five years later he in turn sold it to Bristol-Myers Squibb chief executive officer Giovanni Caforio for $3.9 million. Aesthetic \\"On an experiential level,\\" Della Valle + Bernheimer writes on its website, \\"the design intention was to construct a solid building that would give occupants a panoramic connection to the city.\\" They wanted to avoid building another one of the many colorless and featureless \\"glass boxes\\" that had sprung up around New York in the early 21st century. In their first studies, they considered the idea of architecture from opposites, which ultimately led to using black and white laid in the shape of the \\"idealized zoning diagram\\" for the property, expressing the building's presence between Chelsea and the Meatpacking District. \\"While many new buildings express visual connectivity to the city through ubiquitous expanses of transparent surfaces,\\" the architects continue, pointing to the neighboring Chelsea Modern as an example, \\"our design posits that a solid, totemic object can be equally revealing.\\" To that end the surfaces and windows are as minimalist as possible, with most outer hardware hidden and the large windows surrounded by only a small metallic sill and lintel. Jerry Della Valle told The New York Times that this allowed them to offer buyers a hundred feet (30 m) of windows in each unit, far more than they might get in a comparably priced TriBeCa apartment. His firm's website elaborates on this idea, stating that \\"the window becomes a minimal yet severe vitrine that is mostly invisible but forces spatial containment.\\" The building overall \\"is thus articulated as a pair of linked or nested dualities: solid and void, black and white.\\" Reception The architectural community took note of the building. Even as it was being built, New York magazine included it in a guide to the emerging West Chelsea skyline. Four years later it was included in the Guide to Contemporary New York City Architecture. Despite the considerable difference in aesthetic between it and the neighboring Chelsea Modern, it notes, \\"their shouts for attention link them as much as the property line they share.\\" Architect, the magazine of the American Institute of Architects, gave the building one of its 2009 Annual Design Review Awards for Multi-Family Housing. According to the magazine, its jury referred to the two-tone design on the facade as \\"jacket and pants.\\" It felt the building worked well both as an individual building and as a component of the neighborhood. ‚ÄúIn that area, you have old, low buildings and new, high buildings, so it really reflects that contrast,‚Äù it quoted one juror as saying.

In July 1921, the six unarmed vessels were purchased as \\"tugs\\" for the navy of the newly created Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (from 1929, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Re-armed with two ≈†koda L/45 guns and two machine guns, they could carry 24 naval mines. They all served until April 1941, when they were captured by the Italians during the World War II German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. They were then put into service by the Regia Marina under new names. Five of the ships were lost or sunk during the war, the remaining vessel was put into service by the Yugoslav Navy after the war, and was finally disposed of in 1962. Description and construction The Galeb class was built as wartime s by three German shipbuilding yards during 1917‚Äì1919. Their German designations and builders were: M 97, M 100 and M 112 ‚Äî Joh. C. Tecklenborg, Geestem√ºnde; M 106 ‚Äî Reiherstieg, Hamburg; M 121 and M144 ‚Äî Neptun, Rostock. They had a waterline length of , an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . They had a designed displacement of , and at deep load. They used steam generated by two coal-fired boilers to drive two three-cylinder vertical triple expansion engines driving two propeller shafts. Their engines were rated at and were designed to propel the ship at a top speed of . They carried of coal, which gave them a radius of action of at . The crew consisted of forty officers and men. In German service they were armed with two SK L/45 naval guns, and carried 120 rounds for each gun. They could carry 30 naval mines, and with their minesweeping gear extended, they could maintain a maximum speed of . Service history alt=a black and white photograph of a group of uniformed men The six minesweepers were bought as unarmed \\"tugs\\" by the government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) on 20 July 1921, for 1,400,000 marks each. Their German designations were M97, M100, M106, M112, M121 and M144. Taken into service in the navy of the new kingdom, they were initially classified as mining tenders, and renamed Orao (Eagle), Galeb (Seagull), Gavran (Raven), Jastreb (Hawk), Kobac (Sparrow Hawk), and Sokol (Falcon), respectively. They were rearmed with two ≈†koda L/45 guns and two machine guns, and could carry twenty-four mines. The crew was increased from forty to fifty-one. In 1923, Gavran was renamed Labud (Swan). In 1931, some of the guns were re-lined to to use the same ammunition as the dual-purpose guns fitted to the Yugoslav light cruiser Dalmacija. At least four of the ships mounted the relined guns. The following year, the British naval attach√© reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training, and few exercises or manoeuvres, due to reduced budgets. In August 1935, the seaplane carrier accompanied by Galeb, Labud and Kobac visited the Greek island of Corfu. By 1936, the class had been re- classified as minelayers. In 1938‚Äì39 Jastreb was refitted for oil-firing only. During the World War II German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, all six ships were captured in port by the Italians. Kobac was captured on 10 April at ≈†ibenik, and the remainder were captured on 17 April: Sokol was captured at Split, and the rest at the Bay of Kotor. They were soon put into commission in the Regia Marina as Vergada (ex-Orao), Selve (ex-Galeb), Zuri (ex-Labud), Zirona (ex-Jastreb), Eso (ex-Sokol), and Unie (ex-Kobac). Zirona was damaged and beached near Benghazi on 24‚Äì25 November 1941 after a British air raid, and was destroyed by the Italians on 28 November. Selve was damaged by a Royal Air Force air raid at Benghazi on 6 November 1942, and burned out, finally being broken up in 1948. Eso was torpedoed by Royal Navy aircraft east of Djerba Island off the Tunisian coast on 19 January 1943, while on escort duty with the San Martino and two other vessels. Unie was destroyed by an explosion at Bizerta following an air raid by the United States Army Air Forces on 30 January 1943. The last of the class to be sunk during the war was Zuri, which had been renamed Oriole in June 1942. She was scuttled by her crew on 10 July 1943 at Augusta, Sicily, in the face of advancing British troops, following damage sustained in an air attack south of Messina. The surviving vessel, Vergada, was recovered and handed back to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in- exile at Malta on 7 December 1943.

The company is a fully owned subsidiary of Terra Mauricia Ltd (Terra ex Harel Freres) founded in 1838. The company is the leader in the production of spirits derived from sugarcane in Mauritius. Their New Grove rums and extra neutral spirit are manufactured by their sister company, namely Grays Distilling Ltd.while the commercial branch, Grays Inc. Ltd markets and distributes their brands in Mauritius and in export markets. Additionally Grays Inc is a leading importer and distributor of wines and spirits from the world over into Mauritius and has further diversified into the distribution and marketing of Personal Care, Fragrances, Pharmaceuticals, Home Care and Snacks amongst other consumer goods. History The company origins date back to 1931. As part of its diversification strategy, Harel Fr√®res (now Terra) acquired the Mauritius OK Distillery and moved its installations to Solitude, Triolet. In 1971, the Mauritius OK Bottling was founded to add value to spirits distilled by its sister company. The aim was to better serve the Mauritian market, and distribution was handled by Harel Mallac. In 1978 Harel Mallac and Harel Fr√®res created a 50% JV, Hamarel to focus on the marketing of their brands. In 1982. Harel Freres bought Harel Mallac's shares in Hamarel creating Grays & Co Ltd, rebranded their portfolio of products and launched new Brands. In 2004 Grays created a 50% joint-venture, Les Chais de l‚ÄôIsle de France with Quartier Fran√ßais to produce super premium rums, namely New Grove. In 2006 Grays Ltd opened 26% of its share capital to Distell. This operation gave birth to Grays Inc and a wide portfolio of brands to distribute in Mauritius. Finally in 2011 with the rebranding of Harel Fr√®res to Terra, Grays & Co Ltd was rebranded to Terra Brands, and Grays Refinery was rebranded Grays Distilling. Grays Inc kept its identity as the commercial branch of Terra. Distillery The distillery was created in 1931 when Harel Fr√®res bought the Mauritius OK Distillery. In 1939, with the difficulties of the WW2, the island had problems importing petroleum products and the distillery produced fuel as a substitute.Terra E-Book http://www.terra.co.mu/media/10934/ebook_terra_pdf_lr3.pdf The plant was later renovated to produce rum and other spirits. In 1980 a brand new distillery was built in Beau Plan and The Mauritius OK Distillery was renamed Grays Refinery. This investment significantly increased quality and volumes. Grays Refinery was one of the three last standing distilleries on Mauritius, with the Soci√©t√© de Distillation de Bois Rouge in Saint Andr√© and the Medine Distillery in Bambous.Massel, Hugh Barty-King, Anton (1983).

The season consists of 12 episodes. While the first half of the season received mixed reviews, the second half of the season received much more positive reviews. However, most review aggregates only considered the first half of the season, resulting in an overall mixed score. Ben Travers of IndieWire believed one possible reason for mixed reviews of the show was critics reviewing only the first half of the season. Many critics cited the eighth episode \\"The Telescope\\" as being the turning point of the season, with it changing drastically in tone and developing a darker, deeper meaning. This change was so drastic it resulted in IndieWire changing its policy to only review entire seasons of shows on Netflix, instead of just the first six episodes, which would have boosted BoJack Horsemans C+ grade. This change in perception is starkly noticeable in the show's other seasons, which received critical acclaim on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic.

Tompkins as Mr. Peanutbutter and Andrew Garfield =Recurring= =Guest= Episodes Reception The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported a score of 64%, based on 22 reviews. The site's critical consensus states, \\"It's intermittently funny, but in most respects, BoJack Horseman pales in comparison to similar comedies.\\" On Metacritic, the season received a rating of 59 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Erik Adams' review of the first six episodes gave the series a C+ grade; in the review, Adams wrote that the show \\"spoofs the emptiness of celebrity, but does so without any novelty or true insight\\". At Slate, Willa Paskin was more enthused. \\"[It] is perhaps a little more clever than it is uproariously funny, but it is often very clever, and, moreover, well-tuned to the ludicrousness of the sort of low-level fame that surrounds BoJack\\". She likened it to 30 Rock in its ability to \\"[present] big ideas without having to commit to them\\". Chris Mitchell from Popzara was equally optimistic about the show's future, saying that \\"Fans of FX's Archer or Fox's Bob's Burgers will definitely want to check this one out, as its rapid-fire delivery is always consciously spot- on\\". The New York Times described the show as \\"hilarious and ribald\\". Margaret Lyons of Vulture gave a positive review, describing it as \\"radically sad. I love it\\".

Biography While still a child he \\"discovered his musicality\\" and started to learn the piano at the age of seven. While attending high school in Zagreb, he went on with his piano studies in the class of Ernest Krauth in the Music Academy's Secondary School. He attained a degree at the Law Faculty at which he got a bachelor's in 1933 and acquired a doctorate. In parallel with his studies in the law, ≈†varc continued to be absorbed in music, and enrolled a class of conducting at the Music Academy's College. Alfred ≈†varc (then spelled Schwarz) is also recorded as having been a student of composition in the class of Blagoje Bersa at the Music Academy in Zagreb, as confirmed by Bersa's diary entry for October 14, 1929. The first presentation and reception of Alfred ≈†varc as a composer occurred at the 18th Public Performance of the State Music Academy in which compositions of graduates of the school of Blagoje Bersa were played. In the company of Miroslav Magdaleniƒá and Emil Cipra, ≈†varc introduced himself with his First String Quartet, written in 1930. In a review of the young composers' evening, Pavao Markovac wrote that European models were to be seen in ≈†varc, while Bo≈æidar ≈†irola observed: ‚ÄúA. Schwarz is endeavouring to become free and to create from himself, without models, or rather, according to Romantic and modern models.‚Äù Oeuvre Alfred ≈†varc belongs among composers who at the time when Croatian music was dominated by the neo-national course chose his own path in composition, based on late Romantic and the then prevailing compositional and technical forms of expression. Disappointed with the composing course for the Academy did not offer him what he had imagined, ≈†varc got a job in 1933 in Kri≈æevci in the law, and also worked in Daruvar and Bjelovar. For almost twenty years, 1930 ‚Äì 1950, he composed nothing, although during World War II, he did go in for music while imprisoned in Osnabr√ºck, where he ran a choir of the inmates. ≈†varc filled the period in which he did not compose with an intensive study of melody, harmony and polyphony, their interdependence and unity. When in 1950 he went back to composing, while performing the duties of judge in Glina from 1945 to 1969, he endeavoured to make up for lost time with really vigorous creative work, building up his own composing style. His works are characterised by individually conceived melodic lines, original and specific harmony solutions, a lush polyphony and above all richness of content and profoundly felt music. The more than one hundred works in his oeuvre tend to make great demands on the performer, which is perhaps the reason that only nine works were ever presented to the public during his lifetime, including the two student works First String Quartet (1930) and Etude for Piano (1930), as well as seven works from his maturity: String Quartet in A Major (1951), Fragments from the War for choir (1955), the symphonic poem Song of the Young Hero (1958), the orchestral Overture to a Merry Play (1961), Songs of My Grief for alto and orchestra (1962), Miniatures for Piano (1965) and Concerto for Piano, Violin and Cello (1973).

Baguilat has been known for his unflinching liberal ideals and principles. He is an indigenous leader of the Ifugao ethnic group of the Cordillera mountain range, an incumbent Representative of the Lone District of Ifugao in the Philippines, and the President of the Global Consortium for Indigenous Conserved Communities Areas (ICCA Consortium), an advisory body to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Birth and Education Born to Mr. Teodoro Baguilat Sr., a retired official of the Department of Agriculture and resident of Kiangan, Ifugao, and Mrs. Felisa Brawner, a lawyer and a resident of Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, Teodoro Brawner Baguilat Jr. was born in Manila on July 30, 1966. At the early age of 13, Baguilat decided for himself to return to his father's hometown of Kiangan in Ifugao and rediscover his ethnic roots and identity as an indigenous Ifugao. There, he studied at the St. Joseph School for his secondary education and graduated as salutatorian. He then pursued his tertiary education at the University of the Philippines-Diliman where he took up Bachelor of Arts in Mass communication major in Journalism and was an active student leader in the campus. Early Career From 1987 to 1991, Baguilat worked at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) as an Executive Assistant to the Undersecretary. He also worked as a production assistant for GMA-Channel 7, as a reporter for the People‚Äôs News Service and as an Executive Assistant for the Philippine Ecological Network. In 1991, he decided to go home to Ifugao to put up a foundation to help students and at the same time help protect the environment. In 1992, Teddy ran and won as Municipal Councilor of Kiangan. He would at the time become the youngest Councilor in the Philippines at the age of 25. From 1995-2001, Teddy served as the mayor of the Municipality of Kiangan and was awarded the Dangal ng Bayan Award in 1996. He was also awarded as One of the Ten Most Outstanding Civil Servants in the Philippines by the Civil Service Commission. The award was given by then Philippine President Fidel Ramos. Governor of Ifugao Baguilat ran for the governorship of Ifugao in the 2001 elections and won under the banner of the Liberal Party. During his first term, Ifugao was removed from being one of the poorest provinces in the Philippines in 2003. Despite the gains of his governorship, he narrowly lost in a re-election bid in 2004. He afterwards served as the president of the Save the Ifugao Rice Terraces Movement (SITMo), a non-governmental organization (NGO) that seeks to promote and protect the cultural treasures of Ifugao and its indigenous people. Baguilat ran again for politics in 2007 and was elected as the governor of Ifugao for the second time. Most of his programs/projects were focused on promoting education by securing scholarships to needy students through the Tertiary Education Assistance Program (TEAP); employment assistance for the graduates and skilled workers in coordination with TESDA; providing sustainable employment through livelihood and enterprise development for small and medium entrepreneurs, peoples‚Äô organizations and cooperatives in terms of skills training, technology transfer, product packaging and equipment support which includes One Town One Product marketing promotion and financial assistance; generating clean and cheap energy through Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy; promoting Ifugao as an eco- cultural tourism center; conservation and management of the Ifugao Rice terraces (a UNESCO World Heritage Site); rehabilitation of provincial and municipal roads; using good governance strategies to fight graft and corruption; and reducing maternal and infant deaths with the province-wide investment plan for health-BADDANG and the AYOD community health teams. Before leaving office, the Ifugao Provincial Board filed a case against him for gross negligence during his term as Governor of Ifugao. The filers of the case were inclined to Baguilat's opponent in the incoming elections. The case was later dismissed by the court due to lack of evidence. Representative of Ifugao In 2010, Baguilat ran for congressman and won, despite threats from his opponents. He represented the lone district of Ifugao in the Philippine House of Representatives, the lower house of Philippine Congress. During his first term as representative, the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras was officially removed from the list of endangered world heritage sites through a successive government program which he started during his governorship. Baguilat again ran in 2013 and won by a landslide as representative of Ifugao to the House of Representatives. Baguilat was one of the few initial supporters of the proposed New HIV/AIDS Policy bill in the House, which would address the rising HIV cases in the country. In the 2016 congressional elections, Baguilat ran and won by a landslide again in his native Ifugao province in the Cordillera Administrative Region. He assumed his position and final term as Representative of the Lone District of Ifugao in June 2016 under the 17th Congress of the Philippines. He ran for the speakership in the 17th Congress but lost to Pantaleon Alvarez. He was then chosen as the leader of the minority bloc in the House of Representative via tradition of voting on the speakership. He became the first person from an indigenous community to be elected for the position. However, a few days after, he was booted from the position after more than 20 lawmakers from the majority shifted to the minority to take control of the bloc, therefore, voting Baguilat's ouster from minority leadership and replacing him with a pro-majority lawmaker. The event was criticized by numerous personalities and organizations as the move solidified a super-majority in the House where both the minority simply became a puppet of the House Speaker. Baguilat is one of the key figures in the human rights campaign within the House of Representative under the regime of Rodrigo Duterte. He has supported the SOGIE Equality Bill which would protect the rights of LGBT Filipinos, the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act which gave free public college and university education in the country, the Higher Teacher's Pay bill which increase the salaries of all public teachers, the Divorce bill which would legalize divorce in the country, the National Land Use bill which would protect the usage of lands especially in indigenous people ancestral lands, the Free Wifi Law which provides free Wifi access in all public places, the Department of Fisheries bill which would establish a separate department for aquaculture, the Mental Health Law which would mandate all schools to teach mental health education and for the government to provide aid for issues on mental health, the 100 Days Maternity Law which gives more legal maternity leaves for mothers, the Cordillera Organic Law which would transform the present Cordillera Administrative Region into an autonomous region for the indigenous ethnic communities, the Chico River Basin bill which will establish an authority responsible for the highly- significant Chico River in the Cordilleras, the Indigenous Education bill which mandates the usage of indigenous education in all indigenous communities in the country, the Indigenous Barangay bill which aims to establish fully- fledged barangays where indigenous communities are present, and other bills focusing on indigenous rights. He has consistently voted for liberal ideals. He voted against the re-imposition of the death penalty in the Philippines and the 1,000-peso budget for the Commission on Human Rights. He has also criticized the government for hiring bloggers who have been known for spreading fake news that benefit Duterte's regime. He has also criticized the Philippine Drug War of Rodrigo Duterte which has killed more than 23,000 Filipinos in less than 24 months, and the burial of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the country's cemetery for heroes. Baguilat has also protested against the unfair imprisonment of human rights defender and senator Leila de Lima. Baguilat is the vice president for internal affairs of the liberal bloc. Due to his liberal ideals and positions, two graft cases were filed against him again. The opposition called the case filings as 'political persecutions'. Six months after the cases were filed, the Sandiganbayan cleared Baguilat of graft charges on a technicality, because the Ombudsman's investigation was unreasonably delayed. In November 2018, Baguilat was elected as President of the Global Consortium for Indigenous Conserved Communities Areas (ICCA Consortium), an advisory body to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), during the organization‚Äôs 13th General Assembly held in Bishoftu, Ethiopia.

Situated at the convergence of two iconic hills in the area by name Thevarkunnumala and Alumbumala, the landscape near to the church is spectacular.  Jerusalem Marthoma Church  Jerusalem Marthoma Church is located at 1 Kilometer away from Cherupuzha Town. This Church was established in 1970 and in 1974 credited as a parish.

The church building was re-constructed in 2005. Today the church has become a burning light of Cherupuzha. Today it is a great source of spiritual development as well as a great help to the common people in and around Cherupuzha.

Baptist Church Kokkadavu A peaceful place to share your problems and meditate in a devotional atmosphere. Thalakaveri At the convergence of the rivers Kaveri (or Cauvery), the underground Sujyothi and the Kanike, the Bhangandeshwara temple at Thalakaveri has a distinct Kerala touch. Thalakaveri is in Madekere district in Karnataka state and is about 30 km away from Cherupuzha. Most of the route is through dense Karnataka forest. The forest road leading to Thalakaveri (Bhagamandala) has no regular transport facilities. People usually take a long walk through the forest which is one of the great features of this pilgrimage. Every 17 October, on Tulasankranama, hundreds of people from Kannur and Kasaragod come here to witness the waters of the Kaveri gushing out from its source. It is believed that Goddess Kaveri appears in the form of a spring at Thalakaveri, which is what causes the upsurge at the source. Because of the three rivers, it is also called Triveni Sangama. The serene temple has intricate carvings and a copper roof. A dip at the Triveni Sangam nearby is supposed to revive sagging spirits. For this is Thalakavari (meaning Head of the Kaveri), the origin of one of the seven sacred rivers. The source of this long river, which passes through two states, is on the top of the hill called Brahmagiri. It is 1535 metres above sea level. Narambil Bhagavathy Narambil Bhagavathy originated from the famous Rayaramangalam Temple. The Theyyam was performed in the Kodakkal Koroth Tharavadu, Ramanthali, Muchilot temples, etc. as a Goddess with fiery anger against evil. At Narambil Tharavadu near Cherupuzha, the Theyyam has been performed peacefully. There is an interesting myth behind the origin of Narambil Bhagavathy. One story says that this Amman (mother goddess) was originally a \\"Vana Durga\\", or \\"Forest Goddess\\". She was worshipped by a poor young lady who was married (by arrangement) to a very cruel and much older man who treated her terribly (a sad circumstance that many village girls may be scentenced to). The young woman was nevertheless patient and longsuffering, with her only solace being her own devotion to Narambil Bhadrakali. At one point, this woman gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. After observing the proper post-partem protocols, this young lady went to take her newborn to Devi's temple, both to thank the goddess and bless the child. When she returned home, her cruel husband began to rage that his dinner was not ready, and he beat her savagely. Bhagavathy, sensing what was happening, took her most terrible form: she was wreathed in flames and cobras, with a rutting elephant in one ear-ring, and a roaring tiger in the other. Her fangs were long like a lion's, her tusks curved like a boar's, and her three eyes blazed with brilliance. She had the sun and the moon in her hair, and 500 serpents woven into her braids. She rushed into the house and tore the evil husband into pieces, finally garlanding herself with his entrails (or, in some versions, tossing them into the boughs of her sacred tree). A messenger from Muchilottu Bhagavathy arrived on the scene to calm the goddess down. She advised her to become peaceful, wash her face, and come to eat with her sisters. The people were much afraid, especially the young wife of the evil man (now deceased). Narambil Bhadrakali was moved by compassion, and so assumed a kind, peaceful form, transforming the dead-man's entrails into a flowering vine. She kept the young lady and her child with her as companions, and settled in the area as a goddess who would protect the weak from oppression.

The original inhabitants of the area were primarily Hindus. Later on this region gained a sizable Christian and Muslim population. The economy was agrarian with strong feudal system - Janmi-Kudiyan system - permeating everyday life. Feudal overloads or Janmies owned much of the land, which was leased by the farmers or Kudians who paid a portion (normally 2/10th) of their produce as \\"pattam\\" for the 'privilege' of working the land. Generally, the lease was for a period of 12‚Äì16 years. Farmers were not allowed to cultivate permanent crops, dig wells or cut down the trees on the land. If any permanent crop such as pepper was planted on the land, the income from the crop went to the landlord after six years, depriving farmers of any income from such cash crops. Janmies gave 10 cents of land to farmers to build a house. This region also has a sizable number of people belonging to tribal communities such as Mavilar, Pulayar, and Vettuvar who lived by hunting animals and collecting edible roots and fruits from the plentiful forests in the area. Under the Janmi-Kudiyan feudal system, tribals were treated much like slaves.  Early farming methods  Until the early 1950s, this region used outdated agricultural practices and depended on the monsoons for its irrigation needs. Agricultural land lay fallow after harvest. At the beginning of the next growing season, the bushes that cover the land would be cleared and the plant material burned to prepare the land for the next cycle of rice cultivation. This method, known as punam krishi allowed people to grow staples like rice and black gram.  Transportation  A lack of basic transportation; roads and buses, plagued the area. Initially, the only available bus service was from Peringome which is about 10 kilometers from Cherupuzha. Anyone who needed to buy supplies from the nearby larger town of Payyannur had to ride a bullock cart or walk to get to Peringome. Presently KSRTC (Kerala State Road Transport Corporation) is running Super Class Services through Cherupuzha to various destinations like Bangalore(Payyanur-Bangalore Super Express Air Bus), Kattappana (Cherupuzha-Kattappana Super Fast), Kottayam (Konnakkad-Kottayam Super Fast), Kottayam (Parappa-Kottayam) Super express Air Bus, Pala (Konnakkad-Pala Limited Stop Fast Passenger) Kumily (Konnakkad-Kumily) Limited Stop Fast Passenger etc.so many buses connects Nileshwaramtown and Kanhangadtowns. Roads in this area were initially built to transport timber from neighboring areas. Until 1949, people depended on these roads. In 1949, primarily because of the farmers‚Äô agitations and the Munayankunnu firing incident, a new road was built from Vellore to Pulingome. This road was built to facilitate the movement of Malabar Special Police (M.S.P) in an effort to contain the Communist movements led by leaders such A.K Gopalan and E.K Nayanar. Rivers in this area lacked passable bridges. The only bridges were rudimentary suspension bridges secured using iron cables stretched across the river. Even these were scarce. In rainy season, people had to use rafts made of bamboo (Pandi) for crossing rivers. This unwieldy raft was used by the students of the area to cross rivers to get to schools and back.  Migration from the South  The famine after World War II and the misrule of Sir. C.P. Ramaswamy Iyer incited a large scale migration of people from Travancore (South Kerala) to this area. The migration continued well into the 1970s and 80s. A vast majority of these migrants were Christians who had a completely different social and agricultural background. These hard working people brought new agricultural practices to this area. They introduced cash crops like rubber and daily staples like tapioca to the region. The migrants also brought a new attitude to the region, one that challenged the established Janmi-Kudian feudal system. The migrants bought large tracts of land outright from the Janmies and putdown permanent crops heralding an era of prosperity for the area. The immigrants, despite their cultural and social difference, soon became an integral part of social fabric.  Facilities Until the mass migration of people from southern Kerala, in the 1950s to 1980s, Cherupuzha was a sleepy little village with a few shops and a rundown movie theater. The influx of farmers from the southern districts, mainly Kottayam, dramatically changed the fortunes of Cherupuzha and provided the impetus it needed to become the lively little town it is today. The proliferation of cash crops such as rubber, pepper, ginger, and cashew helped in uplifting the local economy. In earlier times, traditional physicians (Vaidyars) took care of the sick. There were well known physicians in the area whose expertise in Ayurvedic medicines saved countless people from complex problems including snake bites. Later a government rural dispensary was set up at Pulingome. Another major hospital in the area was St Sebastian's Hospital which was set up in 1966 by the Medical Sisters of St. Joseph. Combined with the Konduparambil Nursing Home (now defunct), these institutions helped save hundreds from the ravages of malaria, which was prevalent in the area. Cherupuzha in the 1970s had an upper primary school (JMUP School), a church (St. Mary's Church), couple of little nursing homes (St. Sebastian's and Konduparambil), and a Masjid. Today it boasts several educational institutions such as St. Mary's High School, St. Joseph's Higher Secondary School, Archangels public school, and hospitals in addition to graceful places of worship like the reconstructed Jerusalem Marthoma Church Cherupuzha, Little Flower Baptist Temple Kokkadavu, St. Mary's Forane Church, St. George Malankara Catholic Church, Ayyappa Temple (known as the Sabarimala of North Malabar), Salafi Masjid, Juma Musjid, and Assembly of God Church and by the late 1980s, Cherupuzha became the nerve center of trade and education east of Payyannur. It is well connected by road to, Nileshwar , Payyannur, Alakkode, Thirumeni, Chathamangalam (Kannur), Thabore, Pulingome, Chittarikkal, Malom, Kokkadavu, Rajagiri, Kozhichal and beyond.

Vegetable epithets may be pejorative, such as turnip readily giving offence, or positive, such as the rose or other flowers implying beauty. Tree and flower forenames such as Hazel, Holly, Jasmine and Rose are commonly given to girls. Tree surnames such as Oakes (Oak) and Nash (Ash) are toponymic, given to a person in the Middle Ages who lived in a place near a conspicuous tree. A few plant surnames such as Pease and Onions are metonymic, for sellers of peas and onions respectively. Finally, plant surnames are sometimes emblematic, as in the name Rose, used as a family emblem. Vegetable insults Plant epithets may be pejorative, used humorously and sometimes offensively. Some plant epithets are used directly as insults, as when people are called turnips, potatoes, or cabbages. When the England football team lost to Sweden under Graham Taylor, The Sun newspaper led with the headline \\"Swedes 2 Turnips 1\\", swede being a pun on a particular vegetable, and turnip being an insult. In English the collective term vegetable is also pejorative. Plant epithets are used around the world, but the choice of plants and their meanings vary. Thus in China, \\"stupid melon\\" is used as an insult. In Britain, coconut is sometimes used by black people to insult other people of color; the term indicates betrayal, as coconuts are brown on the outside but white on the inside. Trembling or quaking like an aspen leaf means shaking with fear; this may be descriptive or pejorative, and is recorded from around 1700 onwards, starting with Edward Taylor's Poems. Flower and tree names In contrast to vegetable epithets, flower and tree names are generally positive. \\"English rose\\" has traditionally been used to describe an attractive English woman with a fair complexion. An early documented usage is in Basil Hood's 1902 comic opera Merrie England, while in modern times, the actress Gemma Arterton has been so described. Flower and tree names are used in many countries for girls; examples in English include Bryony, Daisy, Iris, Hazel, Heather, Holly, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Lily, Rose, and Violet. Forms of the generic term flower are also popular, including for example Fleur, Flora, Florence and Flores, and in other languages Anthea, Blodwen, Kveta, Leilani, and Zahrah. English flower names are less common for boys, but include Hawthorn; in the form of May, the same flower is used as a girl's name. Laurel, for a victor's wreath made of the sweet bay or laurel, with feminine forms such as Laura, is used for both boys and girls. Plant surnames People acquired plant surnames in the Middle Ages for different reasons. Toponymic surnames were given to people who lived by a significant feature such as a large isolated tree, a group of trees, or a wood: or, very often, in a village beside such a feature. Metonymic surnames, on the other hand, denoted a person's profession, and include Pease, for a seller of peas,Reaney, page 343 and Onions, for a seller of onions (though some people with that surname got it from the Old Welsh name Enniaum).Reaney, page 330 Robert Plant, lead singer of Led Zeppelin. The surname may be metonymic for a gardener or toponymic for an orchard or a town in France. Plant or Plante itself may be a metonym (gardener), as with Plantebene (a grower of beans, 1199) and Planterose (a grower of roses, 1221), a metaphor meaning a branch of a family, or a toponym, as with de la Plaunt (1273) and de Plantes (1275, 1282), from a place in France such as le Plantis (Orne), or from a planted place such as a vineyard or orchard.Reaney, page 354 Toponymic surnames include Oak, with variants such as Oake, Oke, Oakes, Noke and Roke since 1273,Reaney, page 327 Ash, with variations such as Ashe, Asche, Aish, Esch and Nash since 1221,Reaney, page 15 and Birch or Birchwood, since 1182.Reaney, page 45 Hazel is recorded in many toponymic surnames (sometimes via villages named for the tree), including Hazel itself from 1182, Hazelwood/Aizlewood, Hazelton, Hazelhurst, Hazelgrove, Hazelden and Heseltine.Reaney, pages 223‚Äì224 Surnames such as Hollies and Hollin(g)s, since 1275, mean a person who lived by a holly or holm oak tree.Reaney, pages 235‚Äì236 Surnames such as Plumtree, Plumpton, and Plumstead denote people who lived in places by a plum tree or orchard.Reaney, page 355Mills, page 260 Similarly, Appleby, Appleton, Applegarth and Appleyard name people who lived by an apple orchard, or in villages in Cheshire, Cumbria, Kent and Yorkshire which were named for their apple orchards.Reaney, pages 12‚Äì13 Surnames including Apps, Asp, Epps and Hesp record that a person lived by an aspen tree, the letters often being swapped over.Reaney, page 13 A third source of plant names is their use as emblems, as in the surnames Rose, Royce, and Pluckrose, all meaning a person who used the rose as their family emblem.Reaney, page 383 The English royal Plantagenet dynasty appears to have derived its name from the use of a sprig of broom or planta genista as an emblem. \\"Plantegenest\\" (or \\"Plante Genest\\") was a 12th-century nickname for Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou and duke of Normandy; Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York adopted Plantagenet as his family name in the 15th century, perhaps to emphasise his status as a patrilineal descendant of Geoffrey. Swedish author Astrid Lindgren is named for the Lime or Linden tree. Plant surnames are found in other languages. For example, in Sweden, where \\"Lind\\" means the Lime or Linden tree, the 100 most common surnames in 2015 included at 17 Lindberg (Lime-hill), at 21 Lindstr√∂m (Lime-stream), at 22 Lindqvist (Lime-twig), at 23 Lindgren (Lime-branch), and at 99 Lindholm (Lime-island). Other tree names in the top 100 were 46 Bj√∂rk (Birch), 56 L√∂fgren (Leaf- branch), 66 Bj√∂rklund (Birchwood), 77 Ekstr√∂m (Oak-stream), 79 Hedlund (Heathwood) and 87 Ek (Oak). Many of these names are toponymic; however, suffixes like -gren and -qvist are often metaphorical, meaning an offshoot of a family. From around 1686, Swedish soldiers started to adopt military surnames; short monosyllabic tree-names like Al (Alder), Alm (Elm) and Ek (Oak) were popular. In France, the surnames Laplante (The plant) and Levigne (The vine) denote the owner of a vineyard, or may be toponymic. Tree names also occur in France, where for example the surname Chene (Oak) is not uncommon in Loire-Atlantique and Maine-et-Loire.

It was sponsored by the Pringles snack brand, and was one of several brand-sponsored music competitions to be launched during this period. The competition invited unsigned artists to upload a song to the official Pringles Unsung website, where they could then be voted on by the general public and a panel of judges. The most popular songs from each of seven regions progressed to regional heats in Newcastle upon Tyne, Birmingham, Ipswich, Kingston upon Thames, Leeds, Bristol and Plymouth. The winners of the regional heats then competed in a grand final, where they each performed in front of the judging panel. The judging panel consisted of producers Kevin Bacon and Jonathan Quarmby, ex-Island Records managing director Marc Marot, journalist Paul Sexton and Echo & the Bunnymen lead singer Ian McCulloch. McCulloch had become involved as he wanted to encourage exciting new music. The winners of the Pringles Unsung were Cardiff group The Toy Band, who won with their track \\"Riff Song\\". McCulloch described the band as being \\"great musicians\\" with \\"the magic ingredient\\". Their prize was to record a demo produced by Bacon and Quarmby and to receive management advice from Marot. Response to the competition was mixed. The public relations and communications company GCI London were shortlisted for their role in Pringles Unsung in the Consumer Award category at the 2007 PRCA Awards, but lost out to Nelson Bostock Communications for \\"An Extremis Success\\".

Every year the processions attract tens of thousands of spectators, watching the carnival floats pass along the route leading from the Johanniskirche via Neumarkt to the Rathaus. The traditional cry of ‚ÄúOsna Helau!‚Äù is derived from the city's name. Until 2014 NDR broadcast the procession live on television; since 2015 it has been available as a livestream broadcast.  Course of events  The Ossensamstag procession starts on Johannisstra√üe in the former Neustadt area of Osnabr√ºck. The carnival floats pass by the Stadtprinzenpaar (City Royal Couple) in front of the Johanniskirche. During the course of the procession sweets and toys have traditionally been thrown into the crowds gathered along the route. Alongside carnival associations from the city and surrounding district, floats are provided by various sport teams, other associations, individuals and also music and dance groups. The procession ends in front of the Rathaus, which is symbolically ‚Äústormed‚Äù by the revellers afterwards. The Lord Mayor then hands over the keys of the city to the city prince, who presents his ‚Äúgovernment agenda‚Äù for the next three days. After the procession celebrating participants will then head to the pubs in the Altstadt (old town centre).Ossensamstag.de ¬ª Safety guidelines  Controversy  Previously there had been many discussions regarding Ossensamstag. Critics focused heavily on the large number of highly inebriated (and occasionally underage) participants and the need for large-scale police deployments, litter and mess left after the end of the festival, excessive noise levels and reduced revenues for city centre shops. It was often suggested to move the Ossensamstag celebrations to the Sunday. As a result of these criticisms the decision was taken in 2012 to start the procession at 2 p.m. instead of 11:11 a.m. Volume levels from the carnival floats were ordered to be reduced to 75 dB(A). In addition measures have been taken in recent years to prevent the consumption of alcohol prior to the festivities and intensify breathalyser testing of spectators during the procession. Furthermore all organisations taking part in the procession are expected to contribute 10,000 ‚Ç¨ (collectively) towards cleaning costs.Ossensamstag 2012 - das Experiment  NDR.de - Regional - Niedersachsen - Osnabr√ºck/Emsland  References  Osnabr√ºck ","title":"Ossensamstag"},{"id":"51158473","text":"Laurence Owen Vine Gandar (28 January 1915 ‚Äì 15 November 1998) was a South African journalist and newspaper editor. He is best known as an editor of South African newspaper The Rand Daily Mail. Early life Laurence Gandar was born on 28 January 1915 in Durban, Natal, South Africa. After high school, he attended the University of Natal and obtained a Bachelor of Arts. He would represent the province of Natal in hurdles and long jump. After university, he started work as a journalist on a local paper. When war broke out in 1939, he enlisted in the Union Defence Force and rose from the rank of corporal to captain, becoming the Brigade Intelligence Officer in the 6th South African Armoured Division in Italy. He would marry his wife Isobel Ballance in 1944. Career After the war he returned to journalism in Durban with the Argus Newspaper group and would eventually become an assistant editor. He would leave the newspaper in 1953, describing it as 'spineless', and joined the Anglo American Corporation in their public relations department working as an editor for their publication, the Optima. In October 1957, he was offered the role of editor of the Rand Daily Mail, one of many English South African newspapers owned by Anglo American. He would change the editorial style of the newspaper to a liberal tone, which was in opposition to the views most white people, and would inform South Africans about the racial and human rights abuses of apartheid and challenged the ruling Afrikaner National Party government. He would also challenge the white opposition parties for their lack of firm opposition to Apartheid. His change in editorial style would have a negative effect on circulation in the mid-60s, falling to 112,000 from 125,000 readers and would continue until the papers demise in 1985. In 1959, it was instrumental in persuading liberals to break away from the white opposition United Party and form the Progressive Party and would later assist the new party's only MP, Helen Suzman to be elected in 1961. In a 1963 editorial he would write the following concerning the future South Africa had, > 'There are two choices and only two. There is racial separation, with > massive economic sacrifices - or there is economic integration, with far- > reaching political concessions. There is no middle course. At present we are > trying to get the best of both worlds, and it is killing us.' During June and July 1965, he and journalist Benjamin Pogrund wrote a series of articles on conditions in South African prisons for black South Africans in Port Elizabeth, Pretoria and the Cinderella Prison in Boksburg based on interviews with prison officials and prisoners. The articles cited assaults on prisoners, sodomy and unhygienic conditions in these prisons. The Prison Act, 1959 forbade newspapers from discussing conditions in prisons, forbidding interviews with prisoners, ex-prisoners, and administrators of the facilities, with a possible prison sentence of one year for breaching the act if in defense one could not prove the allegations in court. During this period the newspaper was subjected to around the clock surveillance, Security Branch raids, the eavesdropping of the editor, journalists and the newsroom as well as infiltration by police informants and the intimidations and prosecution of informants. The attacks against the newspaper were also taken up by the government controlled South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) and the Afrikaner newspapers and silence from the English newspapers. On 22 August 1965, he was visited at home and had his passport confiscated and the same would happen to Pogrund. The government would instead of investigating the claims through the means of a judicial inquiry, prosecute two prisoners and two wardens sentencing one to three years in jail, 'confessing' to making up the charges and being a paid informant of the paper, a claim that the Rand Daily Mail was not allowed to challenge at his trial. They would be charged with contravening South Africa's Prisons Act and would eventually appear in court in November 1968 in a trial that last 88 days. The prosecution would successfully argue that 17 allegations in the articles were false and the judge agreed finding the two guilty on two charges of publishing false allegations and not 'verifying' the facts. Gandar was fined R100 on both charges or three months imprisonment and Pogrund received two three-month sentences suspended for three years and subject to him not contravening the Prison Act. In 1965 he fired as editor of the Rand Daily Mail by it board of directors because of poor circulation figures but after a threatened walk-out by the senior journalists, Gandar was appointed as editor-in-chief and Raymond Louw appointed as the new editor. Gander would remain in his new role until 1969. Gandar was appointed the first director of the Minority Rights Group in Britain which investigated and publicized the treatment of the worlds minorities, a position that lasted three years and afterwards returned to South Africa. Honours Gandar won a Kemsley Empire Journalist Scholarship and would spend a year in Britain. In 1974, Gandar was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of the Witwatersrand and in 1990 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Natal. In 2010, he was honoured with a posthumous award as a World Press Freedom Hero from the International Press Institute. Other awards include a gold medal award by the British Institute of Journalists and a World Press Achievement Award in 1966 for his newspaper from the American Newspaper Publishers Association. Death He retired to the south coast of Natal and played golf and invested in the stock-market. His wife Isobel died in 1989. His son Mark died in 1998, and is survived by his wife Jenny and their three children: Collette, Sally, and Owen. Laurence Gandar died in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal South Africa on 15 November 1998 shortly after the death of his son, and after several years of illness, from Parkinson's disease.

Rafiringa was born into a tribe but turned to the Christian faith and was baptized during his adolescence. Rafiringa was beatified on 7 June 2009; Archbishop Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Life Rapha√´l Rafiringa was born as \\"Firinga\\" on 3 November 1856 in Madagascar to Rainiantoandro. His father was a senior official to Queen Ranavalona I and captain of slaves belonging to the noble tribe of Hova. His father lost a child in an earlier marriage. The local sorcerer ‚Äì Mpisikidy ‚Äì said to Rafiringa's father on the latter's decision to call his second son Rakotonirina: \\"Not that name!\\" and explained that the child would die at 22 months just like the previous son; instead the father said: \\"We shall call him Firinga\\". He saw his father on rare instances as a child and would not wear shoes and dressed in a loin cloth alone. He met missionaries from the De La Salle Brothers in 1866 and after this meeting told his father of his desire to go to school where his teacher was Brother Ladolien. He joined the school on 24 October 1869 when he received his baptism; he asked to join the congregation in 1876. Gonzalvien vested Rafiringa in the habit of the congregation on 11 March 1877. Rafiringa agreed to serve as an assistant teacher at the local De La Salle school in 1873. On 1 March 1878 he commenced his novitiate and assumed the religious name of \\"Raphael-Louis\\" and on 21 November 1879 made his profession as the first native of Madagascar to join. He was elected in 1883 as president of the Catholic Union of nationwide Madagascar and made his perpetual profession on 14 November 1889. He knelt before Gonzalvien ‚Äì on 29 May 1883 ‚Äì and the latter blessed him and instructed him to lead the faithful while the missionaries were expelled in 1883; local Christians made him their guide once the last of the missionaries left. On 3 June 1883 he entered a Protestant-guarded church with Victoire Rasoamanarivo whom he met around that time and collaborated with in religious affairs. General Joseph-Simon Galli√©ni awarded him the Medal of Civil Merit on 2 May 1903 for his role in facilitating peace between Madagascar and France. On 24 December 1915 he was arrested and his room was ransacked and manuscripts were confiscated. An inquest started focusing on his writings and officials tried to prove that he was part of the secret V.V.S. sect and took all he owned. Rafiringa was confined to an underground cell with a broken-down table and a covering of wool. Around midnight on Christmas an investigator came to explain the reasons for his arrest and subsequent interrogations and examinations of writings ensured. His trial ‚Äì on 18 February 1916 ‚Äì ended in a positive outcome for him and around 8:00pm he was taken back to his home with the faithful lining the streets to receive him and to kiss his hands for those within reach. He travelled to visit the local bishop ‚Äì on 19 February ‚Äì to ask for a new rosary since his previous one became worn out. Ever since his arrest he suffered frequent bouts of fever and his superiors decided to send him to Fianarantsoa in order to recover. On 15 May 1919 he partook in a celebration that honored Jean-Baptiste de La Salle. He died on 19 May 1919 following his final reception of the sacraments. His remains were relocated to his hometown in 1933. Beatification The beatification process commenced under Pope John Paul II in Madagascar on 18 June 1994 following the \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') that the Congregation for the Causes of Saints granted to the cause as well as titling the late religious as a Servant of God. The diocesan process spanned from 5 December 1994 until 7 June 1995 and received C.C.S. validation on 20 October 1995. The official dossier ‚Äì or Positio ‚Äì was sent to officials in Rome for evaluation while being passed to a board of historians on 29 January 2002 and to a team of theologians on 24 February 2006 for their approval as well; the C.C.S. granted their assent on 5 December 2007 which allowed for Pope Benedict XVI to recognize his heroic virtue on 17 December 2007 and name him as Venerable. The process for investigating a miracle in Madagascar took place for a week from 20 September 2004 until the following 26 September; it received C.C.S. validation in Rome on 2 December 2005 and the approval of a medical board on 11 December 2006. Theologians voiced their approval to it on 16 May 2008 while the C.C.S. also approved it on 2 December 2008. The pope approved it on 19 January 2009 and delegated Archbishop Angelo Amato to preside over the beatification on 7 June 2009 in Madagascar's capital. The current postulator assigned to the cause is Rodolfo Cosimo Meoli. =Miracle= The miracle involved the cure of Pierre Rafaralahy (1862‚Äì1940) in 1927 who became aware of paralysis in his lower body which later that year progressed to total paralysis. He approached the coffin of the late religious ‚Äì which was left at the altar at a Mass on 10 June 1933 ‚Äì on crutches and touched it; he experienced a tremor and could suddenly stand without the need of the crutches.

It was the worst crash in Northern Ireland since 1889. The cause was found to be carelessness of the driver of the autotrain (also called a railmotor) who was running too fast for conditions. Fog, unsafe railway rules, and possible distraction from passengers all may have contributed to the accident. Old lightweight rolling stock contributed to the great number of injuries and deaths. The accident led to the demise of the railway which was nationalised three years later. Background The Belfast and County Down Railway operated the very busy line from Belfast to Bangor. The heyday of the railway was in the late 1800s. By the end of the First World War, the railway was facing competition from buses and private vehicles and was facing economic pressures. In the 1920s some economy measures were put in place such as replacing manned signal boxes with automatic signals. In the 1930s there was an economic depression which put the company under even greater financial pressure. By the end of the Second World War, the pressures were even worse. When this railway implemented the automatic signals on this line, they also introduced a unique \\"Stop and Proceed\\" rule. This allowed the driver of a train to proceed cautiously into an occupied block after waiting two minutes and sounding the whistle, but without communicating with a signalman. Collision There were two trains involved. The first was the 7:10 am from Bangor to Belfast. This was a traditional passenger train consisting of 13 six-wheeled coaches, pulled by 4-6-4 steam locomotive Number 25. The coaches were of an old design with steel and oak undercarriages and light wood coachwork. The train had a seating capacity of 724 and was carrying about 600 passengers. The guard's van was the ninth coach on the train. This had side lights, but the rear coach of the train had only a single red light. The second train was the 7:40 am railmotor passenger train from Holywood to Belfast. This so-called railmotor was three coaches being pushed by a 2-4-2 tank locomotive, Number 5, which was running bunker first. The lead car was apparently a railmotor coach that had been converted to an autocoach. The driver stood in the front of this car and had primitive controls to control the regulator (throttle) and whistle on the steam engine that was in the back of the train, as well as the train's vacuum brakes. The head car was 27 tons with an all-steel undercarriage. The train had a seating capacity of 186. All seats were taken, and there were a number of standing passengers. The 7:10 was stopped at the Ballymacarrett station at the outer home signal of the interlocking at Ballymacarrett Junction, which was beyond the station. It was while stopped at this signal that the train was hit. The rear of the train was near The Oval football stadium. The 7:40 stopped at the Sydenham station for passenger service. When the train was ready to leave, the train was held at an automatic signal due to the track ahead being occupied by the 7:10. The railway's \\"Stop and Proceed\\" rule permitted the 7:40 to move ahead cautiously after waiting at the stop signal for two minutes and then sounding the whistle. The 7:40 did so, continuing to the next station, Victoria Park. At this station, there was another signal, unrelated to the automatic signals, instead showing caution relating to the fact that the signal where the 7:10 was already stopped was at danger. This signal at Victoria Park did not remind the 7:40 driver that the block was occupied. Also at this time, it was still dark, and there was a very heavy fog. After receiving and discharging passengers at Victoria Park, the train continued. The driver saw the light in the back of the 7:10 train at only 30 yards away and allegedly tried to stop his train, but the lead car of the 7:40 collided with the rear car of the 7:10. The heavy steel lead car of the 7:40 rode up over the underframe of the rear wooden coach and ploughed through the entirety of its coachwork and ten feet of the next car's coachwork as well. The passengers in the rear two cars of the 7:10 suffered the vast majority of the deaths and injuries. Thirteen passengers died at the scene with nine passing from their injuries later all from the 7:10. 23 passengers in the 7:10 and one from the 7:40 were injured along with three crew members. Rescuers came from the neighbourhood of the crash, including many workers from the nearby Harland and Wolff Shipyard. The rescuers built bonfires to help illuminate the scene and included using the roof of the destroyed coach to help feed the bonfires. Buses also illuminated the scene using their headlights. Investigations There were at least three inquiries into the crash, a criminal inquiry against the driver of the 7:40 in April 1945, a collection of several civil cases against the railway, and a Ministry of Commerce investigation by R. Dundas Duncan, the Inspector of Railways for Northern Ireland. =Criminal Inquiry= The driver of the 7:40, Isaac McQuillan, was charged with manslaughter in April 1945 for the death of a passenger: Samuel Wilson. During the hearing, two passengers testified that they were in the driver's compartment. One of the witnesses said there were six passengers in the driver's compartment. He was found not guilty after four days. During the trial, an expert witness for the defence said the \\"Stop and Proceed\\" rule was unheard of in Britain and placed an unfair burden on the driver. Another defence witness, a civil engineer, said the police tests of the braking system found it to be extremely inefficient. He further testified that because the two coaches that collided were of such different construction, this greatly contributed to the severe loss of life on the one with none in the motor coach. =Civil Cases= There were at least 18 civil cases that were consolidated down to one test case for purposes of determination of liability on the part of the railway . The victim used as the test case was James McCoy of Sydenham. On 22 July 1946, this test case was found in favour of the plaintiff who was awarded . This allowed damages to be assessed in all the other civil cases. In March 1947, a damage claim of was dismissed for plaintiff John McCoy, of Holywood because he was travelling on a weekly ticket, and one of the conditions of that ticket was \\"its holder will have no legal right of action against the company for injury, however caused.\\" In February 1947, the Railway tried to have its liability in the case of William Redpath of Bangor reduced by the amount of monies received by the victim from charities. The argument was rejected in March. As of February 1948, cases were still being settled. =Ministry of Commerce Investigation= The public hearing was held on 29 January. Mr. Duncan stated that it was the worst rail crash in Northern Ireland since 1889. After opening the hearing and asking if anyone present had anything they wished to say and no one offering, Mr. Duncan declared that he would hear the evidence in private. After a protest from a member of the public, Mr. Duncan explained that the purpose of the hearing was to learn what could be changed on the railways to prevent future accidents and was not to fix blame. Mr. Duncan said he would collect evidence in private to collect evidence with the greatest candour possible. The final report was released five and a half months after the accident on 2 June 1945. The report found that the 7:40 railmotor train had a few shortcomings related to its equipment. The train could be stopped faster if it were running engine first because the driver could use the brake valve in the engine instead of the somewhat less effective brake valve in the autocoach. Also, the way that the mechanical linkages were arranged that connected the regulator control from the driving trailer was somewhat unreliable in that there was play in the system that prevented the regulator from being opened fully. There was also an issue where a connecting pin in the regulator linkage was prone to falling out. More importantly, the driving coach had a compartment for the driver separated by a sliding door from the main part of the coach. When loading and offloading passengers, one of the two doors for the passengers was through the driver's compartment. It was revealed that the dividing door was rarely closed by this driver. Furthermore, the driver was shaky in his testimony regarding whether there were, in fact, any passengers in his compartment when the accident occurred. It turned out that the reason the 7:10 was still stopped was that there was a faulty signal. The signalman at the interlocking had tried to clear the signal to allow the train to continue, but it was stuck in the danger position due to wet or frosty weather causing the mechanism to stick. The signalman was on his way from the signal box at Ballymacarrett Junction to the 7:10 train to signal it in person when the accident occurred. The report commented on and criticised the fact that the signal system was in need of modernization and that the rules that permitted this accident to occur should be made more stringent. It pointed out that elsewhere, telephones are provided at signals so that drivers can report signals holding them and receive clear instructions on whether it is safe to proceed. The report concluded that the 7:40 was running too fast for conditions and at considerably more than the 8 to 10 mph that the witnesses claimed. The damage done was simply inconsistent with a low speed. The driver of the 7:40 was solely blamed for the accident for running at too high a speed for the conditions and the signals received. The author of the report indicates that there seemed to be no braking action before the collision. The driver was also criticised for the possibility of allowing passengers in the crowded train to stand in his compartment that may have provided a distraction. Aftermath Rail service was restored very quickly. One of the two lines was back in operation by 11 am the same morning, with full service restored by 5 pm. The job of telling the families of the victims about the accident and the loss of their loved ones fell to the Station Master of Bangor with his assistant, who were accompanied by a police officer. He was so troubled with at least one family that he was unable to talk, and the policeman had to speak for him. Since most of the dead and injured were from Bangor, the Mayor of Bangor organised a disaster relief fund drive the night after the accident to help the families who suffered losses. The drive raised some , which is considered extraordinary for the time given, the hardships that the area and the entire British Commonwealth had been through with the Second World War. Push-pull trains were withdrawn from service; the Stop and Proceed rule was removed, and lineside telephones were installed after the accident. The Railway had to pay out in compensation, which crippled it financially since it was already in a weak financial condition and had no insurance to cover an accident such as this. It was nationalised a few years later in 1948.

For the majority of his life, he resided in Paris where he published monographs focusing on the work of contemporary French and Italian artists. He was the founder of the periodical XXe Si√®cle.  Early life  Gualtieri di San Lazzaro was born Giuseppe Papa in Catania in 1904 and was raised in Venice by his father. He assumed the pseudonym ‚ÄòGualtieri di San Lazzaro‚Äô when he launched his professional career in Rome in the early 1920s.  Paris  In 1924 San Lazzaro moved to Paris. After having edited Les Chroniques du Jour, San Lazzaro established his own publishing house √©ditions des Chroniques du Jour.R. Prosperio, 'Note a proposito de Les Chroniques du Jour di Gualtieri di San Lazzaro, editore italiano a Parigi (1925-1938)',Vers Une Europe latine. Acteurs et enjeux des √©changes culturels entre la France et l'Italie faciste, edited by C. Fraixe et al. Paris and Bruseels, 2014, pp. 65-82 In 1928 he published Les Ma√Ætres Nouveaux, which focussed on mainly French and Italian painters and which was to be the first of two series of monographs on contemporary artists. The second series of monographs, XXe Si√®cle was introduced in 1929. The first volume was dedicated to Henri Matisse, authored by Florent Fels and co-published with Anton Zwemmer in London and E. Weyhe in New York. A volume on Pablo Picasso by Eugenio Ors was similarly co-published and represents the largest print run in the series at 650 copies in English and 550 in French.  XXe Si√®cle  San Lazzaro launched the illustrated periodical XXe Si√®cle in 1938. Featuring high quality reproductions of varied visual imagery including Western paintings and Far-Eastern prints, the inclusion of original prints by contemporary artists in every issue was its defining feature. Artists who contributed to the periodical include Wassily Kandinsky, Hans Arp, Giorgio de Chirico and Joan Mir√≥. The periodical was not published between 1939 and 1951. After its relaunch in 1951, XXe Si√®cle engaged with more specific thematic, material-based issues such as mark making and concepts of space and also concentrated on the formation of an international dialogue between Italian and French artists including Marino Marini. The periodical was distributed in Italy by Carlo Gadazzo, the owner of the Naviglio Gallery in Milan, which became the site for San Lazarro's exhibitions of the work of contemporary French artists. In 1968 L√©on Amiel assumed control of XXe Si√®cle and in 1970 Amiel purchased the XXe Si√®cle Company. Until his death in 1974 San Lazzaro continued to publish books and albums of prints including the Homage to Marino Marini (New York, 1970) . Following his death two exhibitions were dedicated to San Lazzaro: ‚ÄòOmmagio a XXe Si√®cle‚Äô (Milan, December 1974) and ‚ÄòSan Lazarro et ses Amis‚Äô (Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Moderne, Paris 1975).

Location Parombo is located in Padyere County, Parombo Town Council, in Nebbi District, in northwestern Uganda. It is approximately , by road, north of the international border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This location is approximately , by road, southeast of Nebbi, where the district headquarters are located. The geographical coordinates of Parombo are:02¬∞18'13.0\\"N, 31¬∞12'11.0\\"E (Latitude:2.303611; Longitude:31.203056). Parombo sits at an average elevation of above sea level.  Overview  Parombo is divided into six administrative divisions; namely (a) Parwo (b) Pagwata (c) Ossi (d) Padel (e) Pangarere and (f) Pulum. The growing urban area has a town board. Population The national population census and household survey, carried out on 27 August 2014, enumerated the population of Parombo Subcounty at 41,286 people. This population is mainly rural and the urban centre is a much smaller fraction of the sub-county. The majority of inhabitants of the sub-county and the town are the Alur people. Challenges Two of the most challenging issues for Parombo are water scarcity and poor sanitation. The water crisis in Parombo and surrounding communities dates back for nearly two decades. The town and surrounding areas have protected springs, shallow wells and boreholes from which they collect water for animal and human use. But these infrastructure developments do not meet all the area's water needs. In 2018, National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) was tasked to establish a piped water system in Parombo Town Council and in the surrounding communities. Work is continuing, although initial attempts to locate a suitable water source have been unsuccessful. Due to the absence of a centralized sewerage disposal system, sanitation remains a challenge as sometimes sewage contaminates water sources for human consumption, as happened at Parombo Secondary School in March 2019.

The line is one of the longest and most important routes in Poland and is part of the European E20 (Berlin - Moscow) route. Opening The first calls for a railway between Pozna≈Ñ and Frankfurt (Oder) were in 1842 when an appeal was made to landowners along the route. However, the line did not come to fruition, due to the deposition of a decision on the matter by the government of Prussia. Eventually the line was opened in stages from 1870. Between 1925 and 1930 the course of the section Chlastawa - DƒÖbr√≥wka ZbƒÖska changed in connection with the construction of the station in ZbƒÖszynek. The original section of the line, built in 1870, remained active until the reconstruction of the ZbƒÖszynek‚ÄìGorz√≥w Wielkopolski railway as a temporary course of the line to Gorzow Wielkopolski. In Poznan and Wrze≈õnia the course of the line has also been changed over the years. Route The town of Wrze≈õnia has a bypass which is used by express trains, with a number of services leaving the line to serve the station in Wrze≈õnia and rejoin the main line again afterwards. Modernisation Between 1998 and 2007 the route underwent considerable modernisation because of its importance as part of route E20. The work made it possible for passenger trains to travel at 160 km/h, freight trains at 120 km/h. This involved improving the track, catenary, stations, level crossings and signalling.

The rise of the microchip and the advent of affordable synthesisers enabled countless artists for whom guitars, drums and bass had become old hat, and in grubby bedsits, unremarkable living rooms and art school halls across the British Isles, UK electronica was born. The underground, fuelled by cassette exchanges, co-operative vinyl compilations and a thriving mail order network, quickly began to stretch the boundaries of sonic experimentation.\\"Close to the Noise Floor: Formative UK Electronica 1975-1984 A review by Pitchfork further develops the theme: \\"The primitivist phase of the synthesizer came after the sophisticated start. In the late 1970s, cheaper machines like the Wasp became available; they were also compact, portable, and relatively user-friendly compared with their bulky predecessors. This democratization of electronics happened to coincide with rock‚Äôs own self- conscious return to juvenile basics in the form of punk. .....Close To the Noise Floor is a 4xCD survey of the excitingly messy birth of British electronica during the late '70s and early '80s. .....‚ÄúMinimal synth‚Äù works as a shorthand tag for Close To the Noise Floor's remit, although the scope of the trawl is actually wider and more disparate than what that term tends to signify, taking in electro-punk, industrial, synthpop, dark ambient, and more. Rather than use generic focus as an organizing principle, the anthology achieves coherence through sticking with a single country‚ÄîBritain‚Äîwhen it could have easily have swept across the equally active European scene or harvested the scattered but significant American exponents like John Bender and Nervous Gender. The national focus makes sense historically, in so far as the UK scene was catalyzed by half-a-dozen native outfits who released debut singles within a few months of each other ... Close To the Noise Floor provides a fascinating overview of the formative years of British home-studio electronica: groups who were precursors in spirit, if not direct lineage, to the techno and IDM artists of the ‚Äô90s.Pitchfork Reviews 2016 close-to-the- noise-floor Metacritic gave the 4 cd boxed set a score of 89.Metacritic Review Website 2016 =Legacy= In May 2016 Record Collector magazine (Issue 453) as part of a review of ‚ÄúClose to the Noise Floor‚Äù by Oregano Rathbone pays particular homage to the original Final Program track \\"Protect and Survive\\" first released 35 years earlier: \\"Whatever nexus of elements provided the impetus, it‚Äôs significant how almost homely so much of the chilly electronica produced in that era now seems. ‚ÄúAdorable‚Äù is emphatically not what any of them would have been going for; but listening to, for example, In The Room by Third Door From The Left, or the earnest and utterly wonderful Protect And Survive by Final Program ‚Äì ‚ÄúWHAT‚ÄôS ALL THIS I HEAR ABOUT NUCLEAR FALLOUT?‚Äù proclaims vocalist Richie Program, in a stentorian android monotone ‚Äì the envisioned dystopia was clearly our dystopia, a comfortably familiar landscape bordered by Frisbee-trapping pylons, rough-cast Bauhaus concrete and the Poundsaver monophonic synths that acted as sonic emojis for The Tomorrow People.\\"Record Collector magazine (Issue 453) May 2016 In the late 1980s Richie program relocated to London, spending some years as an independent fashion designer and playing a semi-opaque role in various social and cultural developments including the anti-poll tax movement.

He is a 32-year-old from Sydney's southern suburbs now living in Syria. He is believed to be the highest ranking Australian member of al-Qaeda. Biography =Early life= Abu Sulayman was born Mostafa Mohamed in Egypt and migrated with his family to Australia soon after his birth. In 1985, he was granted an Australian passport. He was raised in Sydney's predominantly Anglophone southern suburbs and was reportedly the only Muslim at his primary school. Abu Sulayman reportedly was devoted to Islam from early in his life and set up the first students' Islamic society at his school. He later became a preacher in Bankstown in Sydney's Western Suburbs, at the now defunct Al-Risalah centre. =Islamist militancy= By the early 2000s, he was associated with a small group of fundamentalists within Sydney's Muslim community. In 2003, those associations brought him to the attention of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. He was approached by ASIO officers and asked to provide information about a small group of Sydney men he knew, but he refused. Two years later those men were arrested in Operation Pendennis. He was seen appearing at court to support some of the men, who were convicted of planning terrorism. Abu Sulayman was also close to Bilal Khazal, an Al-Qaeda member who had travelled to Afghanistan and met Osama bin Laden. This supports what is commonly supposed, that he was associated with Al-Qaeda long before his travel to Syria. When Khazal returned to Australia he became a key facilitator for Australians who wanted to join Al Qaeda. He was also an associate of Houssam Sabbagh, a Lebanese al-Qaeda leader in Tripoli, Lebanon who lived in Sydney from 1989 to 2005. =Move to Syria= Abu Sulayman arrived in Syria in late 2012 and soon after was appointed as one of the most senior religious scholars within Jabhat al-Nusra. According to The Australian, Abu Sulayman was threatened by Australian Jihadist Khaled Sharrouf. Sulayman reportedly has three children and a wife, whom he left behind in Sydney. =US and Australian sanctions= In May 2016, the United States declared Abu Sulayman a \\"Specially Designated Global Terrorist.\\" However, The Australian reported that Abu Sulayman was put on a US \\"kill list\\" a few years before. In August 2015, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop included Abu Sulayman on Australia's counter- terrorism sanctions list. In a statement released by the Australian Foreign Minister's office, Bishop maintains that Abu Sulayman has solicited funds to finance Al-Nusrah Front's terrorist activities and has recruited Australians to travel to Syria to join the \\"terror \\".

Early life and education Brussaard was educated at University of Groningen (RUG), The Netherlands, studying marine biology, and microbial ecology. She defended her PhD thesis on 'Phytoplankton cell lysis and ecological implications' in 1997. She was awarded a Marie Curie TMR-grant supplied by the EC for 2 year Post Doctoral research at the University of Bergen, Norway. In 2000 she started as Independent Research Fellow at the NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute of Sea Research where she was involved in the EC-FP5 project BIOHAB (Biological Control of Harmful Algal Blooms - role of eutrophication) studying the growth and mortality of HAB- species, while at the same time setting up a virus ecology research program. She became a Senior Research Scientist at the NIOZ in 2003, and obtained a special chair in Viral Ecology in the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) in 2013. Career and impact Brussaard is a scientist for Antarctic viral ecology, the quantitative and qualitative significance of viral mediated mortality of microbes for population dynamics, community composition, and the production and efficiency of the pelagic food web. Brussaard's research focuses on studying the interaction between viruses and their host algae in relation to climate change, and more specifically on how this interaction is affected by environmental factors, such as CO2 concentration and temperature, the availability of light and nutrients. Brussaard studies the ecological role viruses play in the sea, combining field work and detailed laboratory studies. She investigates the importance of microbial (phytoplankton and bacteria) cell death rates and its consequences for the pelagic biogeochemical cycling (carbon, nutrients including iron), as well as isolation of novel algae- infecting viruses (e.g. viruses infecting Phaeocystis belonging to the recently named large-genome Mimiviridae family). She also discovered the first dsRNA virus that infects protists and lipid membrane-containing Micromonas viruses. Additionally she has developed methods for the rapid detection and enumeration of viruses, and for measuring cell lysis rates as a consequence of viral infections. Brussaard is the President of the International Society of Microbes (ISVM) and is also the Chair of the Netherlands Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) Committee from 2006 until 2016 and its secretart from 2014‚Äì2018. She was also a member of the Netherlands Polar Committee from 2010‚Äì2014 and is a Fellow of the American Academy Microbiology and of the Council for Earth and Life Sciences of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Brussaard's research has received interest from radio, newspapers and magazines. Moreover, Brussaard was a guest on the Dutch television show Pauw & Witteman on 23 January 2013 to discuss the then new Dutch Dirck Gerritsz Laboratory. In March 2016, Brussaard was selected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology.

A main theme is the compatibility of economic growth with sustainable development and climate protection.  Organization  Based in Berlin, the institute was founded in 2012 by Stiftung Mercator and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). The research team is composed of an interdisciplinary group of scientists from economics and the social sciences. Directed by the climate economist Ottmar Edenhofer, MCC currently employs some 50 staff. Website MCC. Archived from the original on May 30, 2016. In 2015 the MCC was designated as the world's second best climate think tank.  Work The work of MCC falls into two main areas: research and policy dialogue. The aim is to gain interdisciplinary insights and to provide a basis for decision-making in politics, industry and civil society. The theme spanning across all the work is the global commons (i.e., natural resources such as the atmosphere, land, oceans and forests) and the premise that international cooperation is indispensable for the sustainable use of the commons. For example, when the atmosphere is understood as a global commons, it is seen to belong to everybody despite its physical presence at the national, local and regional levels. In this case, overarching rules are needed to prevent this resource from being overused (see ‚Äútragedy of the commons‚Äù). Other examples include the overfishing of the oceans or the exploitation of wildlife. The lack of availability of public goods, which provide access to health care, education, clean water and much more, the so- called social commons, comprises a core focus of the work of MCC. Based on scientific findings, potential solutions are identified, evaluated and provided. The global commons (Source: MCC) = Research = The research of MCC is divided into seven working groups and one task force: MCC Working- groups. Archived from the original on May 30, 2016. * Economic growth and human development: Analysis of the relationships between economic growth, greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption. * Land use and urbanization: Investigation of the relationships between urbanization and global environmental changes, especially the sustainable development of cities from a social and ecological perspective. * Sustainable resource management and global change: Analysis of possible solutions for sustainable resource management and the provision of public goods. * Polycentric governance: Study of the institutional preconditions for achieving the 2 ¬∞C target, including of the instruments allowing for the prompt adoption of a sustainable climate policy. * Scientific assessments, ethics and politics: Evaluation with respect to the handling of ethical aspects and diverse interests in integrated environment-related policy assessments. * Geographic production and consumption patterns: Analysis of geographic production and consumption patterns as well as of the extraction and trade of raw materials in the global economy, and the visualization thereof. * Climate change and development: The importance of expanding industrial structures and infrastructure for economic development and the resulting climate-related dependencies. * Task Force ‚ÄúPublic Economics for the Global Commons‚Äù: Identification of implementable political measures for achieving an efficient and fair access to the global commons. In addition to scientific research, policy advice is central to the work of MCC. Moreover, these two focal points build on each other and give rise to a self-perpetuating cycle: The scientific research findings form the basis of the consulting work (‚Äúpolicy dialogue‚Äù), while the consulting becomes the subject of research in that it is subjected to scientific evaluation. = Policy dialogue = Climate protection and sustainable development are areas that are intricately interwoven over the long term. For example, using biomass to produce ‚Äúclean‚Äù energy to limit global warming could potentially result in increasing deforestation, biodiversity loss or rising food prices. The earth‚Äôs soil is still home to vast amounts of fossil fuels; yet the atmosphere‚Äôs capacity to absorb CO2 is limited. (Source: MCC) The complexity of the possible consequences of these (climate) policy actions requires a forward-looking, international perspective. Here, the role of science could be to provide a sound informational basis without prescribing policy decisions. The target groups of the policy advice of MCC are, among others, decision- makers from international organizations, parliaments and public administration as well as stakeholders from private-sector companies and NGOs.MCC Evaluation Report .

Attack The attack took place around 16:30 CEST (14:30 UTC) by a kebab shop where the perpetrator, a 21-year old Syrian asylum-seeker, and his 45-year old victim both worked, and from where he retrieved the weapon. The attacker and the victim had an argument before the attack. The attacker then killed her with the weapon he retrieved from the shop and also injured another woman and a man. He was subdued by the police after he was accidentally hit by a car whose driver was distracted by the surrounding commotion. The Polish embassy confirmed that the victim, was Polish and claimed she was pregnant. Police are investigating under the assumption that it was a personal quarrel between the assailant and the dead woman. Perpetrator The assailant was identified as a 21-year-old asylum seeker from Syria who had migrated to Germany about one- and-a-half years before the attack. He worked at the same Turkish kebab shop where the pregnant victim worked. He was known to police and was previously arrested for causing bodily harm. He had lived in a home in the town for seven months. One of his former roommates identified his first name as Mohamed and described him as an alcoholic who was feared by his other roommates. He also said that the attacker was in a relationship with the victim and both had previously lived together in a refugee camp. Trial and sentencing The perpetrator was tried and sentenced to life in prison. Impact This attack, one of four violent crimes, including the Ansbach bombing, committed by people of Middle Eastern background during the week of 18 July 2016 ‚Äì three of them committed by asylum seekers ‚Äì created significant political pressure for changes in the German government policy of welcoming refugees. According to The Washington Times, the attacks increased public fears that Islamist terrorist attacks of the kind that took place in France in 2015 and 2016 could happen in Germany. Florian Otto, a risk consultant from Maplecroft, said the attacks are likely to inflame anti-immigration sentiment in the country, creating a challenge for the Merkel government's policies.

Headquartered in Tehran, it is the principal agency responsible for meteorological observations, weather forecasting and seismology, operating hundreds of observation stations across Iran. History In 1298, the meteorological office was included in the Barzegaran school curriculum, taught by French teachers. The first platform for the measurement of meteorological data, air temperature, relative humidity and rainfall was built and completed in 1929 in the Barzegaran school. After World War II, the first meteorological observatories were established in Iran by the Allies in 1948. The study of the atmosphere has always been of interest to Iranian scientists. Therefore, many astronomers have devoted part of their work to atmospheric issues. Muhammad ibn Zakaria al-Razi, Ibn Sina, Hakim Omar Khayyam, Abu Rihan al-Biruni, and Anwari were among the Iranian personalities and scholars who wrote about atmospheric phenomena in their works. Regular meteorological activities began with the measurement of atmospheric elements, British and Russian embassies in Tehran and the oil-rich southern regions of the country, and this information was transferred only to the archives of the respective countries and probably used in their research programs. The meteorological course was included in the curriculum of the Barzegaran School in 1298, taught by French teachers, and the first meteorological platform was built on the same site to measure air temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall. The meteorological station was completed in 1308 and housed most of the atmospheric elements, until gradually, due to the extreme need of agriculture and irrigation, a number of other stations were established in different parts of the country as needed, with the independent irrigation firm. , Affiliated with the Ministry of Agriculture at the time. After World War II, Allied forces set up a small meteorological unit to meet the aviation needs of the aviation sector for the health of the flight of its own aircraft. At that time, the Independent Irrigation Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture trained a group of meteorological observers, who graduated in 1327 and worked at meteorological stations. The national airline also set up meteorological stations due to the need for weather information at the country's airports. Due to the urgent need for climate change statistics and information from different parts of the country and the inconsistency in the establishment of meteorological stations - which were created in different sectors - the authorities of the time considered it necessary to establish an independent meteorological unit in the country; Therefore, in 1334, the General Meteorological Office of the country, affiliated to the Ministry of Roads, was established. The General Directorate later became an independent organization under the auspices of the Ministry of War, which, under the auspices of the Islamic Revolution, regained control of the Ministry of Roads and Transportation. At the time of the establishment of the General Meteorological Office in 1334, all meteorological stations - which had been established in various departments - were handed over to this General Directorate. The assigned stations were of synoptic, climatological and rainfall type, each carrying out its own observations. At that time, there were thirty-four synoptic stations, one hundred and seven climatological stations, and one hundred and sixty meteorological stations. The expansion of meteorological stations and the development of its network accelerated after the victory of the Islamic Revolution. In 1338, Iran's meteorology became a member of the World Meteorological Organization as one hundred and third members of the World Meteorological Organization. Prior to the Islamic Revolution of Iran, the country's Meteorological Organization was more in the service of air transport and the aviation industry, and less attention was paid to practical meteorological issues; However, after the Islamic Revolution and by determining agriculture as the main axis of the country's economic activities, this organization also shifted its services to agriculture and today, the development of stations and the approach of the country's meteorological statistics system to provide services to agricultural research and animal husbandry. , Irrigation, etc., tends to.

This information includes temperature, air pressure, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and wind direction. The measurement of wind speed and direction is done in such a way that there is no obstacle to the wind as much as possible, and the measurement of temperature and humidity is done away from direct sunlight. Manual measurements are performed at least once a day and automatic observations are performed at least once an hour. The climate of the sea is measured by ships and oceans, which measure relatively different aeronautical quantities, including sea surface temperature, wavelength, and wavelength.

It began in San Francisco with its first hackathon in December 2011 at Adobe and has expanded to over 105 cities globally and 53 countries in the past eight years. The company primarily organizes hackathons, but has recently expanded into innovation consulting, virtual hackathons, acceleration and incubation. The company boasts the most global and diverse developer community of 250,000 members. The company also claims to have twenty-one percent (21%) female membership, well above the industry average.  Company Mission  The company website states AngelHack's mission as ‚ÄúTo be the world‚Äôs premier innovation management agency, serving as a catalyst for rapid growth and development of individuals and organizations who are navigating periods of transformative change.‚Äù  Annual Global Hackathon Competition  AngelHack hosts an annual global hackathon competition where entrants compete to build and launch new software solutions over the course of 36-hours. Hackathon events are hosted in several cities around the world and winning teams are chosen to receive coveted acceptance into the AngelHack Hackcelerator program. Every year the competition has a non-technical theme which inspires its developer community to do better and to think outside of the typical developer mindset. AngelHack HACKcelerator AngelHack also runs the HACKcelerator, a pre- accelerator program that provides mentorship to entrepreneurs and showcases companies to investors. Notable AngelHack HACKcelerator teams include WeFunder and Microryza, both of which have been inducted to Y-Combinator. Another HACKcelerator project, Waigo Translate, has been inducted into 500 Startups. Two HACKcelerator graduates have been acquired by Google: SlickLogin and Appetas. Another team, Osper, was able to raise over $10 million in seed- funding. In 2015 AtumSoft secured their first $100,000 in funding from Lab360 and facetime with Y-Combinator.  Ownership  Gregory Gopman founded AngelHack with Krystyl Baldwin in 2011.https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/angelhack When Krystyl had left, Sabeen Ali joined as Co-Founder in 2012. The two had a rather public and contemptuous separation. Gopman was reported to have stolen company funds and former employees recall Gopman as never being around and ‚Äúgalavanting abroad‚Äù. In February 2014 then Co-Founder and CEO sued Gopman. Currently, AngelHack is a female-owned, female-majority company.  Lawsuit Sabeen Ali v. Gregory Gopman  In the lawsuit filed in a California State Superior Court, Gopman's co-founder and AngelHack CEO Sabeen Ali accuses Gopman of removing Ali from the company bank accounts without authorization while diverting $70,000 to his credit card debt, and $4,500 a month to pay his rent. Gopman is also accused of allegedly changing AngelHack corporate account information, including the passwords to social media accounts, and emailing all AngelHack employees claiming that he would fire them. According to the suit, the trouble began right around the time that Gopman and Ali signed an agreement replacing Gopman as AngelHack CEO. The suit claims breach of contract and seeks an injunction against Gopman.  Sabeen Ali  Prior to AngelHack, Sabeen founded and sold her own leadership training and organizational development company; Team Building ROI, which provided leadership and organizational development training to companies such as Google, IBM, Blackberry, NetApp, Cisco, and others. She holds an M.S. in Organization Development from the University of San Francisco and is an expert in change management. Sabeen also founded Code For A Cause, a nonprofit organization that aims to make technology and coding accessible for all, and to bring the tech community together to make the world a better place. Founded in 2013, CFAC has organized events and initiatives designed to connect developers, support women and girls, minorities, veterans and other disproportionately disadvantaged communities. She speaks internationally to corporate, nonprofit and student audiences on rapid innovation, entrepreneurship, acceleration, women in tech initiatives, and more. She has received numerous accolades for her work, most recently including the Harari Conscious Leadership and Social Innovation award. Her work with AngelHack and CFAC has been highlighted in Inc., Fast Company, Voice of America, and featured in the hit documentary: Seed.  Acquisitions  AngelHack announced its first acquisition in 2016. Codeity, a developer recruiting platform. Codeity will connect AngelHack's global community of developers with jobs that best fit their skills with companies ranging from Fortune 500s to emerging startups in the tech industry. Codeity differentiates itself by focusing solely on the job-seeker's skill sets for matching employers with candidates, while masking age, gender, first name and previous employers, it reduces the potential for bias in the hiring process. Employers and companies will not have access to these masked elements until a profile has been identified for matching skill sets, then employers can unlock the candidates information to make an offer. Focusing on skills before demographics will help to ensure that companies get matched with the best qualified applicants, every time. It will also help companies identify promising and valuable candidates who might otherwise be overlooked.  Code for a Cause  Code For A Cause is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 2011 by Sabeen Ali and the AngelHack team, after seeing an opportunity to create a dialogue about the huge equality gap the tech boom created and to leverage our core competencies to give back. We aim to make technology and coding accessible for all, and to bring the tech community (including our ecosystem of 100,000+ developers) together to make the world a better place. So far, it has helped organize 15 hackathons to build technology in support of issues including safety, girls and women's economic empowerment, entrepreneurship, sanitation, veterans‚Äô issues and more.

He was Communist Party Secretary, Governor and CPPCC chairman of his home province Shaanxi. He was a delegate to the 13th and 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. He was a member of the 14th and 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Hu was a powerful provincial official in home-province Shanxi in the 1990s. During his tenure, he focused on energy alternatives, water development and conservation, the environment, education, economic development, and supervised the construction of Taiyuan-Jiuguan Expressway, Taiyuan Wusu International Airport, and Taiyuan railway station. At the same time, with his name and political influence, his town sons Hu Zhiqiang and Hu Wenqiang got a meteoric rise in local politics and local state-owned enterprises. But Hu Zhiqiang was sacked for purchasing offices and selling offices and collusion between officials and businessmen. Early life and education Hu was born into poverty in Xiahuo Village () of Zhangzi County, Shanxi, in October 1937, after the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out. Both his parents were poor farmers. He had eleven siblings, but only him and two younger sisters survived. His mother died young and the three of them were raised by his father. After middle school in 1957, Hu entered the workforce as accountant in local people's commune. In 1958 he was accepted to the newly established Vestibule School of Coal, which was attached to Lu'an Bureau of Mines (), and he joined the Communist Party of China in the next year. In October 1960 he enrolled at the Fuxin College of Mines (now Liaoning Technical University), where he majored in mining. =Career= After graduating in 1964, Hu was assigned to Datong Bureau of Mines () in Datong, a city rich in coal resources in his home-province. He spent almost 20 years working at the province's institutes about coal resources before serving as vice-minister of Coal Industry in Beijing. In 1988 he was appointed vice- minister of Energy, he concurrently served as general manager and party branch secretary of China Unified distribution Coal Mine Corporation, a state-owned company. In the Spring of 1990, People's Daily published an article titled \\"The Vice Minister's Wife Burns the Boilers\\" and subsequently published another article \\"Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee's Black Lammy\\", praising Hu was a clear official and good official. In July 1992, Hu was transferred back to Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi province, where he was appointed deputy party chief and acting governor of Shanxi. In early 1993 he was installed as governor of Shanxi, replacing Wang Senhao. In September of that year, he was promoted to party chief of Shanxi, the top political position in the province, where he served until June 1999. He concurrently served as CPPCC Committee chairman of Shanxi between March 1994 and February 1995. During his term in office, he focused on energy alternatives, water development and conservation, the environment, education, economic development, and supervised the construction of Taiyuan-Jiuguan Expressway, Taiyuan Wusu International Airport, and Taiyuan railway station. In June 1999, Hu was transferred to Beijing again and was appointed as deputy director of the Department for Poverty Alleviation of the State Council, a position at ministerial level. He served in the post until he retirement in May 2005. Now he is the president of China Association of Poverty Alleviation & Development. Personal life Hu married Chang Genxiu (). The couple has two sons: Hu Zhiqiang and Hu Wenqiang (). Hu and his family are Buddhist believers, they built a Buddhist temple named \\"Anle Temple\\" () in their hometown. In the temple there is a jade statue of Guanyin worthing 200 million yuan. Every year during the Chinese New Year, businessmen drive to their home to pay New Year's greetings. Hu Zhiqiang was Mayor of Yulin, Communist Party Secretary of Yulin, and Party Branch Secretary of Shaanxi Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission before he was placed under investigation by the Communist Party of China's anti-corruption agency in June 2018. Hu Wenqiang is now the deputy general manager of Shanxi Coking Coal Group Co., Ltd. (), a state owned company headquartered in Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi province.

It was with the aid of his detailed drawings that a replica of the original spire was constructed. During the Victorian era there was a Gothic revival in the design and restoration of churches.

Despite viewing the appointment to this position in a distant corner of the Empire as a form of exile, he set off, after a short briefing with the Tsar in St. Petersburg, three weeks later by train to Bessarabian capital Kishinev from Moscow. The journey took two nights and three days, which Sergey spent in his private compartment studying his purchased guidebook to prepare himself for the meeting with the civic dignitaries, whom he expected to meet at arrival. Despite writing to his Vice- Governor requesting he keep the reception party small, Urusov was met by a crowd of people and an orchestral band at Bendery, the first major Bessarabian town; with a group of policemen cordoning off the Vice-Governor in a complete dress uniform, alongside the city mayor with a platter of bread and salt, Urusov was greeted as Governors had traditionally been greeted in Bessarabia. One and a half hour later Urusov arrived at the administrative centre of Bessarabia: Kishinev; here he was driven round the city in an open carriage, with the sidewalks packed with bystanders who 'bowed, waved their handkerchiefs', with some even going down on their knees. A modest man, he admitted to being 'struck' by the matter, as he was not familiar with such displays of reverence. After a blessing in the Kishinev cathedral he arrived at the Governor's Residence, a palace in neo-classical style in the city centre.Figes, p. 42‚Äì43 Impressed by the city centre's architecture, its paved boulevard and streets lined with white acacias and poplars, large stone buildings, he noted that it would 'have made no unfavourable impressing' even in the Empire's capital St. Petersburg. As a local celebrity, he was refused to travel except in a carriage with the Chief of Police and a mounted guard escort. The provincial society was alien to him and he was taken back by the 'god-like esteem' he was held in, as well as the local aristocratic customs (etiquette did not even allow him to walk or go shopping).Figes, p. 43 =1905 Revolution and Duma years= Witte, who was given the task of assembling the first cabinet government in October offered 'the liberals' several important positions: Sergey Urusov was offered the important post Minister of the Interior; he was soon rejected though on the grounds that 'he was not a commanding personality', although 'decent' and 'fairly intelligent'.

The issue has two political sides: utility companies that to pay solar customers the \\"wholesale rate\\" for their excess electricity, and solar panel installers and solar customers who want utility companies to pay the \\"retail rate\\" (higher than the wholesale rate). Under net metering, utility customers with solar panels get a credit for the energy they send back to the grid. The credit offsets the energy that they use from the grid. According to The Arizona Republic, \\"Utilities view net metering as a subsidy because they essentially pay retail rates for power from rooftop solar panels when they could purchase wholesale power much more cheaply, even from renewable sources.\\" Solar companies take the opposite view; net metering is not a subsidy and without customers being able to get a credit for their excess energy, they wouldn't save money on their electric bills (and hence, would have much less or little incentive to install solar panels in the first place).  2013 rate hike  In November 2013, the Arizona Corporation Commission approved a small fee for people who operated solar panels at their homes. Specifically, the fee was levied on people who were a part of the net metering process, meaning they would sell back to the utility company any extra energy that their solar panels produced. The fee was 70 cents per kilowatt of installed solar panels, amounting to around $5 per month per house. According to IEEE Spectrum: > \\"Net metering has been controversial among utilities across the United > States and in countries like the UK as well, because of claims that if > customers generating electricity at home are allowed to sell electricity > back into the grid at the going spot price of electricity, then the added > system costs of providing the needed infrastructure will be shifted to all > the rest of the customers.\\"  2014 election  In 2014, two Republican candidates (Tom Forese and Doug Little) ran for and won seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission. The campaign ads, both for and against the candidates, were highly negative. The campaign pitted the solar leasing industry against utility companies, particularly SolarCity against Arizona Public Services (APS). According to The Arizona Republic: > \\"The campaign got ugly. Besides questioning Forese and Little's motivations > for seeking office, the rooftop-panel leasing companies took out ads > depicting Little as a Pomeranian \\"lap dog\\" to APS.\\" After Forese and Little won and began their terms, they traveled to California to meet with SolarCity executives. Both parties are working toward finding common ground.  2016 proposed state constitutional amendment  In the 2016 election cycle, a group called Yes on AZ Solar attempted to get an initiative on the ballot that would have amended the Arizona Constitution regarding net metering. The initiative was called the Arizona Solar Energy Freedom Act. It needed 225,963 signatures to get on the ballot. As it was written, the amendment focused on the payment structure between utility companies and people who have solar panels and generate extra power that they sell back to the power grid. The amendment would have required utilities to pay the solar customers the same price that the utilities charges all its customers. In favor of the amendment, the head of Yes on AZ Solar, Kris Mayes, said: > \\"We believe Arizonans have the right to decide this issue for themselves. > ... Do we want to be the solar capital of the world? Do we want the right to > produce our own power? Arizonans will overwhelmingly say, yes, we do. Solar > is part of who we are as Arizonans. This will enshrine that fact in the > Constitution.\\" In opposition to the amendment, Jim McDonald of Arizona Public Service Co., said: > \\"This is a ridiculous attempt by California billionaires to get richer by > forcing higher energy costs on Arizona consumers. ... It works against > Arizona families and is detrimental to sustainable solar in Arizona.\\" In the end, the amendment did not make the ballot. Yes on AZ Solar worked with Arizona state legislatures on a compromise in exchange for dropping the effort to place the amendment on the ballot.  2016 rate proposal  In 2016, Arizona Public Services (APS) proposed a new fee structure for net metering in Arizona. The structure included a grandfathering provision. Per the proposal, rates would change beginning on July 1, 2017. Investor's Business Daily wrote, \\"By then, APS estimates, non-solar customers will have paid $1 billion over 20 years to carry solar subsidies. . . . But the Arizona proposal also carries the potential of killing solar demand in the state . . .\\" The proposal would switch the burden of costs from people without solar panels to people with them. When the proposed fee structure was written, the current policies required utilities to pay customers on a \\"one-to-one\\" basis instead of the wholesale rate. A \\"one-to-one\\" basis means utility companies would have to buy back energy at the same price they sell it at, which is higher than the price that utilities normally buy it at (called the wholesale rate). Utilities have argued that being required to purchase energy at an inflated price forces them to charge all customers higher rates; in effect, they argue that non-solar customers subsidize the solar customers through the higher rates. Companies that install solar panels, such as SolarCity, could face hurdles in trying to make a profit in Arizona. In 2016, Arizona's solar market was around 124-megawatts. The proposed fee structure seems to be on hold until after the November 2016 elections. Three seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission are up for election.  2017 rates for Tucson Electric Power  The Arizona Corporation Commission approved new rates for Tucson Electric Power in early 2017. The new plan adds new rates; adds new solar fees ($2.05/month for residential customers and $0.35/month for small commercial customers); gives a monthly discount of up to $15 to low income people; and overall, adds $8.50 to the average customer's monthly bill.  Discontinuation  In December 2016, the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) voted to discontinue net metering. The new rate will be based on the cost of energy from large solar farms; the rate is expected to be much lower than the retail rate, which is approximately 11.5 cents per kilowatt-hour from Tucson Electric Power Company (TEP). The utility proposed using the cost of its recent power-purchase agreement for utility-scale solar at 6 cents. A decreased export rate and the ACC‚Äôs decision to suspend banking has prompted solar customers to add a battery to their solar systems and never send energy back to the grid. Arizona utilities TEP, APS, and Trico Electric Cooperative sought to put an end to net metering because, as the utilities have said, solar customers do not pay their portion of fixed grid costs. Solar companies and advocates responded by explaining that solar energy is worth far more than the utilities claim regarding decreased costs and pollution. They also stated that a decrease in net metering rates would destroy the industry. Hawaii has eliminated net metering, and at least 25 other states are considering the move.

Early life He studied electrical engineering at the Royal Technical College in Glasgow, graduating in 1944. He did his National Service, becoming a captain in the Royal Engineers. Career He entered the oil industry in 1947. =BP= North Sea oil fields Until the mid-1960s no-one knew that the North Sea contained so much oil (United Kingdom Continental Shelf, or UKCS). Britain imported all of its oil, costing around $1bn per year. Sea Quest discovered the Forties oil field on 7 October 1970; the vessel had also discovered the first North Sea oil field on 14 September 1969; Sea Quest had a significant effect on the UK economy. The Forties field is around 110 miles east of Aberdeen. During 1971 and 1972 BP drilled to a depth of 7,000 feet, and estimated the field to contain around 1.8 billion barrels of oil. He joined BP in 1969, and was made responsible for expansion at Llandarcy oil refinery, the UK's first oil refinery. He became head of the BP Forties Development Group in 1972, the height of the North Sea oil bonanza.Cromarty Petroleum Order Conformation Bill October 1976New Scientist April 1974 He remained in charge of the Forties oil field until 1977. Four platforms were built in the field (Block 21/10); each was 16,800 tonnes and 550 feet high, with two built by Highland Fabricators (HiFab) at Nigg Bay in the Cromarty Firth; the Forties pipeline system came ashore at Cruden Bay, then to Grangemouth Refinery (Kinneil Kerse). He was an executive at BP Petroleum Development. In April 1976, his team at the Forties field received a Queen's Award. In February 1975 he became general manager at BP Petroleum Development. On 3 November 1975, the Queen came to BP's headquarters at Dyce to switch on the BP Forties field, in his presence. He left BP in 1978. Production from the Forties field peaked in 1979 at 500,000 barrels per day. BP would drill oil from the Forties field for 27 years. Personal life He died aged 62 in December 1986 in west London. At BP he was captain of the BP football team at Aberdeen. He enjoyed reading the works of Charles Dickens. He was married and had a son and two daughters. He was made an OBE in the 1969 New Year Honours, and a CBE in the 1976 New Year Honours.

She also discovered two asteroids, 1718 Namibia and 2437 Amnestia, at the Turku Observatory in 1942. Background Marja V√§is√§l√§ was the daughter of astronomer Yrj√∂ V√§is√§l√§, a renowned discoverer of minor planets. After she graduated from the university, she was going to start working as his father's assistant. However, she had heard from one of the student friends, Lahja V√§√§n√§nen, of missionary work in Ovamboland. V√§√§n√§nen's parents, missionaries Nestor W√§√§n√§nen and Martta W√§√§n√§nen, had worked as in Ovamboland, Nestor during 1907‚Äì1918 and 1921‚Äì1928 and Martta during 1909‚Äì1918 and 1921‚Äì1928, and Lahja herself was born in Ongandjera, Ovamboland, in 1915, so she was personally familiar with the missionary work in Ovamboland. Later she also worked in South West Africa herself, in Kavango during 1947‚Äì1953.Peltola 1958, p. 263, 270. Work in Swakopmund =Preparing for her work= V√§is√§l√§ arrived in Africa in 1949. She spent her first year there in South Africa, studying the most important languages in Southern Africa, English and Afrikaans, and the local culture. South West Africa was for all practical purposes the fifth province of South Africa at the time. =The location of the school= Before V√§is√§l√§ arrived in South West Africa, the Finnish missionaries there had heard of a ‚Äúmaster of sciences in astronomy‚Äù, and they were afraid that such a highly learned person might not be suitable for teaching small children. However, V√§is√§l√§ turned out to be excellent both in pedagogics and organization. At the time, the Finnish missionaries were debating where the future Finnish school should be founded. Some of the missionaries favoured Ovamboland, and it is clear that they were thinking that some of the children would be able to live at home when attending the school. However, the children whose homes were in Kavango would not have had the same benefits, as their journeys home during vacations would have been much longer than for the other children. V√§is√§l√§ favoured Swakopmund for two reasons. First, the weather was better for children there than in Ovamboland, and there they would also be safe from the diseases that were encountered in Ovamboland, e.g. malaria. It would also be possible for the children to engage in sports activities, since the climate was cooler. V√§is√§l√§ also considered the cultural atmosphere of Swakopmund to be better there than that of Ovamboland. The matter was finally resolved by the board of the Finnish Missionary Society, which, like V√§is√§nen, favoured Swakopmund as the location of the new school.Sepp√§nen 1994, p. 29, 38‚Äì39. =The school facilities= V√§is√§l√§ started the school in rented premises in 1950, but it soon turned out that the premises were not large enough. The owners, too, informed her that they were going to sell the premises in the near future. In 1952 V√§is√§l√§ heard that the town planned to have a new neighbourhood to the north of the town centre. On the last day of May that year, she signed a bill of purchase for two adjacent lots in the future Vineta neighbourhood. The Finns then built a house, which would function as both a school and a dormitory. A housewarming party was held in connection with the church service for the first advent in 1953. In 1858, an annex was built on the same lot, containing a garage and a room.Sepp√§nen 1994, p. 41‚Äì50. =The curriculum= V√§is√§l√§ decided to stick to the curriculum of the schools in Finland. However, the school year was that of South Africa, i.e. it was the same as a calendar year. This would have meant difficulties for those families which were returning to Finland, but many children were sent to school in Swakopmund at the age of 6, and they were ahead of children in Finland by some six months. V√§is√§l√§ taught her students three languages, English, German and Swedish. History was taught according to Finnish textbooks, but in geography and biology she concentrated on local circumstances, plants and animals. Singing and music were taught, too, but physical education, arts and crafts and art did not receive as much attention as other subjects.Sepp√§nen 1994, p. 66‚Äì70. Teaching methods V√§is√§l√§ used a method she had devised herself, and called it ‚Äúthe method of expanding circles‚Äù. This method evolved out of necessity, when she had children of various grades in the same room. \\"The topic of the lesson would be the same for all children, but the younger students would be taught elementary knowledge and basics, whereas with the older students she would get deeper into details,\\" wrote Kalle Sepp√§nen in his 1994 master's thesis in theology. Sepp√§nen wrote the following concerning V√§is√§l√§'s methods:Sepp√§nen 1994, p. 72. V√§is√§l√§ felt that the teaching of the first grade was the most difficult task, especially if the children did not know how to read when they came to school. Also, the grades from the 3rd grade up were problematic, because she was not able to devote as much time for these students as she would have wanted to. During later years she was able to get other teachers to help her with her tasks. According to Sepp√§nen, V√§is√§l√§ was ahead of her time what came to her teaching methods. Often, she would actually teach the children but help them find out about things for themselves. This was the case inside the school building and during the many excursions and tours that she organized to various places.Sepp√§nen 1994, p. 72‚Äì74. In 1963, the head of the Finnish mission in South West Africa asked V√§is√§l√§ if it would be possible to transfer her to the Oshigambo High School in Ovamboland, as the founder of that school, Toivo Tirronen was about to leave for Finland for a furlough. V√§is√§l√§ wrote later that already during the preceding year she had thought that her various difficulties and the illnesses of the children were becoming too much for her, and she had pondered whether she was already too old to teach young children. Thus she decided to say yes to the head of the mission.Sepp√§nen 1994, p. 74‚Äì75. Work in Ovamboland During 1963‚Äì1972, V√§is√§l√§ worked at the Oshigambo High School in Ovamboland as its teacher of mathematics and natural sciences. She described the first years of this school in her book Ambolukion lehtorina (\\"teaching in the Ovambo high school\\"; 1967). She returned to Finland in 1972 to take care of her elderly mother.  Discovery of asteroid  The Minor Planet Center credits V√§is√§l√§ with the discovery of the asteroids 1718 Namibia and 2437 Amnestia, both discovered at Turku Observatory on 14 September 1942.

The church is dedicated to the Annunciation, and was probably an early Christian basilica, of which only the synthronon and the episcopal throne in the semi-circular sanctuary conch survive. In middle Byzantine times the building was converted into a transitional cross-in-square church. A domed narthex was later added, flanked by the chapel of Saint Akindynos to the north and a vaulted rectangular room to the south. According to an architrave inscription probably from the templon, the church was renovated in 1052. The inscription also mentions the names of Bishop Leo, Niketas, \\"protospatharios and tourmarches of Naxia\\" and Count Stephen Kamilaris. Other 16th and 17th-century inscriptions refer to subsequent repairs. The church interior is decorated in five successive layers dating to the early Christian period; the 9th century (non-figurative decoration); and the 10th, 11th, and 13th centuries. Some of these were detached and then repositioned once the earliest layer had been removed, so frescoes from different periods are now visible. The first layer of frescoes dates to the 7th century - apostles adorn the bottom of the conch, while the side of the window has a depiction of St. Isidore. The second layer painted over the Apostles in the conch consisted of non-figurative decoration, with crosses in the arcades, and dates to the Iconoclast period in the 9th century. The two superimposed layers uncovered in the dome have been dated to 1052 and 1056 respectively, as they have been linked to the architrave inscription and a further inscription in the north chapel, commemorating the Assumption of the Servant of God Anna in 1056. All the same, it is also believed that the first layer detached from the dome, along with other wall paintings in the south antenna, date to a slightly earlier period, in the 10th and 11th century. The depictions of Saints George, Nicholas, Dimitrios and Theodore incorporated in the eastern section of the second layer date to 1052. According to another view, the depiction of the Annunciation on the south wall of the sanctuary is later, dating to the 11th or 12th-13th century. In the late 13th century the lower part of the sanctuary conch was re-decorated with co-officiating bishops, only one of whom has survived in detached form. The Supplication depicted in the apse was painted later.

Location The Cujubim Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) takes its name from the Blue-throated piping guan (Aburria cumanensis), locally called the Cujubim and a common bird in the region. The reserve is in the municipality of Juta√≠, Amazonas and has an area of . It is the largest conservation unit in Amazonas and the largest sustainable development reserve in the world. It lies along the Juta√≠ River, a tributary of the Solim√µes River that flows in a northeast direction to the west of the Juru√° River. The conservation unit also contains the Bi√° and Mutum rivers, tributaries of the Juta√≠. The reserve may be reached by boat from Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, distant. The trip would typically take about eight days. A flight to Fonte Boa Airport, the nearest commercial airport, cuts the boat journey to three and a half days. The Cujubim Sustainable Development Reserve is part of the Central Amazon Biodiversity Corridor, along with other conservation units on either side of the Solim√µes. It is upstream from the Rio Juta√≠ Extractive Reserve. The Vale do Javari Indigenous Territory adjoins the reserve to the west and the Rio Bi√° Indigenous Territory adjoins it to the east. The Rio Bi√° Indigenous Territory in turn adjoins the Uacari Sustainable Development Reserve and the M√©dio Juru√° Extractive Reserve on the Juru√°. History The Cujubim Sustainable Development Reserve was created by decree 23.724 of 5 September 2003. It became part of the Central Amazon Ecological Corridor, established in 2002. The deliberative council was created on 3 April 2008. The management plan was approved on 13 March 2009. The conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Environment The weather is hot and humid. Average annual rainfall is . Average temperatures range from . The land is flat, with maximum elevation of . Vegetation is mainly open alluvial forest with palms, but there is great diversity. The land along the rivers includes seasonally flooded v√°rzea or igap√≥ forests. Higher up the forest is terra firma, and is more dense or open depending on variations in relief. In some areas there is succession forest regenerating after human activities such as mining and oil prospecting. The reserve is in the Inambari area of endemism, one of the most diverse of the Amazon forest. More than 700 species of plant have been recorded. Further studies are needed, but the reserve is estimated to harbour at least 600 species of birds, 90 bats and 16 primates. The reserve hosts populations of threatened or endangered species such as the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor) and Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis). The first record in Brazil of the eastern lowland olingo (Bassaricyon alleni) was made in the reserve. Other species include white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), big-headed Amazon River turtle (Peltocephalus dumerilianus), six- tubercled Amazon River turtle (Podocnemis sextuberculata) and pirarucu (Arapaima gigas). Economy The reserve is in a very isolated area, with high levels of poverty and low human development indices. Most of the residents are descended from the \\"rubber soldiers\\" who moved to Amazonia from the north east of Brazil during World War II (1939‚Äì45) to work as rubber tappers. Due to lack of health and education infrastructure many families left the region for the cities in the 1980s, but many could not adapt to city life and later returned. A survey before the reserve was created showed that about 56% of residents were illiterate, while the remainder had no more than 4th grade elementary education. 39% of residents were children under ten years old and less than 1% were over 70 years old. In April 2008 there were 36 households registered in the Bolsa Floresta program of the Amazonas Sustainable Foundation. In 2015 there were almost 290 people from 56 families in the reserve. They engage in extraction, fishing, hunting and farming. The main sources of income are marketing salmorado fish, particularly surubi, logging and capture of turtles. Extracted products include oils, straw, vines, fruits, honey and rubber. The most common timber species are Ceiba pentandra, Copaiba, Virola, Calophyllum brasiliense, Ocotea cymbarum, Carapa, Virola sebifera and Cedrela odorata. The residents have traditionally depended on \\"regat√µes\\" (middlemen) who purchase their products and bring supplies from the city, often at unfair prices. Credit is being supplied so the residents can break free of debt to the \\"regat√µes\\" and market their products directly. As an alternative to logging the agencies involved in managing the reserve are encouraging extraction of resins, copaiba and andiroba oils and rubber. Fruit, vegetables and medicinal plants are also potential sources of income.

He was a member of the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\") between 1920 and 1932. Early life Kurt Samuel Rosenfeld was born at Marienwerder, a mid-sized town near Danzig, then in West Prussia. Between 1896 and 1899 he studied jurisprudence and social economics at Freiburg (where one of his teachers was Max Weber), then moving on to Berlin from where he emerged in 1905 with a doctorate in law. After this he took a job as a lawyer in Berlin. While still a student he joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). Political activity prior and during the First World War Between 1910 and 1920 he served as a Berlin city councillor. For most of this time he was on the left wing of the SPD. He was also building a reputation as a trial lawyer: during this period he defended in court like minded political comrades including Rosa Luxemburg, Kurt Eisner and Georg Ledebour. Other left wing Berlin politicians in his circle included Clara Zetkin, Karl Liebknecht, Franz Mehring, Karl Radek and Anton Pannekoek. Between 5 August 1914 and 9 November 1918 Kurt Rosenfeld took part in the First World War as a soldier. He was nevertheless one of those in the SPD who had opposed the party leadership's 1914 decision to agree a political truce at the outbreak of the war and, more specifically, to vote in favour of \\"war credits\\". As the scale of the human slaughter on the front line and of the economic destitution on the home front mounted, the number of SPD politicians opposing the war increased, and it was primarily over this issue that the party split in 1917. Rosenfeld was among those who formed the breakaway faction, which now became the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). German Revolution During the year of revolution that followed the war Rosenfeld served briefly, between November 1918 and January 1919, as Prussia's regional justice minister. In 1919 he was elected to the Prussian State Assembly (\\"Preu√üische Landesversammlung\\"), the body mandated to devise and enact a constitution for what was called at that point the Free State of Prussia (\\"Freistaat Preu√üen\\"). Developments in Prussia were replicated at a national level. The emperor had abdicated in November 1918, and a body known (because it was convened at Weimar) as the Weimar National Assembly was mandated to devise a new democratic constitution for a democratic state. Rosenfeld was co-opted to join the assembly on 3 May 1920, taking the place of , a USPD member who had died. The constitutional assembly's work was by now almost concluded, but on 21 May it was dissolved, to be replaced by a national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\"). Rosenfeld was a USPD candidate at the general election two weeks later, and was elected, representing Electoral District 13 (Thuringia). He was now re-elected in successive elections, remaining a Reichstag member till 1932. SPD activism 1922-1931 Election poster for SPD 1928 The Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD), having been the product of a split in 1917, itself broke apart at the end of 1920 when the majority joined the new German Communist Party. Kurt Rosenfeld was part of the minority that stayed within a much diminished USPD, but the arguments continued. Following the assassination of Walther Rathenau in 1922, many took the view that in the post war context of economic destitution, the residual USPD now had too much in common with the SPD to persist as a separate movement. Kurt Rosenfeld, Theodor Liebknecht and Georg Ledebour were the most high-profile USPD opponents of any political reunification, but when, in September 1922 the political parties nevertheless formally remerged, Rosenfeld (unlike the other two) went along with the USPD majority. After 1922 Rosenfeld's was positioned firmly on the left wing of the SPD, together with colleagues such as Paul Levi and Max Seydewitz. From 1927 he was one of the SPD left wingers producing \\"Klassenkampf\\" (literally \\"Class Struggle\\"), a rather theoretical Marxist journal produced under the auspices of the SPD. As the political temperature rose in the later 1920s, Rosenfeld was one of those urging closer collaboration between the SPD and the Communists as a way to counter the growing menace of right wing demagoguery. In March 1931 he was one of the left wing Reichstag members who voted against the naval budget. He also continued to work as a leading defence attorney. Of particular note was his defence of Carl von Ossietzky in the 1931 \\"Weltb√ºhne\\" case. Socialist Workers' Party activism 1931-1933 In 1931 Rosenfeld was one of six left wing SPD members of parliament excluded from the SPD group in the Reichstag following a \\"breach of party discipline\\". At the heart of the disagreement was the decision of the party leadership under Otto Wels to \\"tolerate\\" the Br√ºning government, in a desperate - and with the benefit of hindsight unsuccessful - attempt to \\"stabilize the tottering state\\" and avert a Nazi take-over. Rosenfeld and fellow-expellee Max Seydewitz now founded the Socialist Workers' Party (\\"Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands\\" / SAPD). Rosenfeld and Seydewitz became co-chairmen of the new party serving in the post, in Rosenfeld's case, till the early part of 1933. In exile Early in 1933 Rosenfeld resigned from the SAPD and called on fellow members to link up with the Communist Party. However, the political backdrop had been transformed in January 1933 when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one-party dictatorship. At the end of February the Reichstag fire was instantly blamed on the Communists, and in March 1933 Communist members were expelled from the Reichstag which was in any case rendered irrelevant by enabling legislation that allowed the government to rule without parliamentary consent. Communists began to be arrested: Kurt Rosenfeld was one of those who managed to escape to Paris which was rapidly becoming the informal headquarters of the German Communist Party in exile. He set up a Paris-based anti-fascist press agency called \\"Agence Impress\\". In Germany the Reichstag fire in February 1933 was quickly followed by a trial which was given maximum publicity by the Nazi government in order to blacken the reputation of the Communists and provide justification for the post-democratic changes that the government had implemented. Outside Germany a number of political refugees organised an alternative \\"counter-trial\\" in London which took place in September 1933, and concluded that the real perpetrators of the Reichstag fire were the Nazi elite. Kurt Rosenfeld was one of those involved in the London \\"counter-trial\\" which received much press coverage in English-speaking parts of the world. However, by the end of 1934 he had made his home not in London but in the United States where he worked closely with exiled German communists. It seems likely that at some stage he himself joined the exiled German Communist Party. In the US he was able to do some work as a lawyer. He also teamed up with Gerhart Eisler to produce, from 1941, a German language news journal \\"The German-American\\". He also became president of the \\"German American Emergency Committee/Conference\\", which was part of a wider campaign to unite German and German-speaking opponents to the Hitler regime across the American continent. In 1943 he also became honorary president of the Latin American Committee of a Free Germany. However, in September 1943 he died at his home Queens, New York.

She lived during the time of the Cristero War and remained out of the nation during some of it in order to avoid the anti-religious persecution of the times. Espinosa's beatification was celebrated in Mexico on 21 April 2012 with Cardinal Angelo Amato presiding over the celebration on the behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Life The herald of the Poor Clare order she founded. Manuela de Jes√∫s Arias Espinosa was born in Mexico in 1904 as the fifth of eight children to the pious Eustaquio Arias Arroniz and Mar√≠a Espinosa L√≥pez Portillo. She made her First Communion in 1911. Her religious calling blossomed in 1924 after attending a religious congress from 5‚Äì12 October 1924 and received inspiration after reading an account of Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux. But her firm decision to enter the religious life did not come until the Feast of Christ the King in 1926. Espinosa entered the \\"Ave Maria\\" convent in Los Angeles on 5 June 1929. Espinosa made her initial vows on 12 December 1930. She made her perpetual vows on 14 December 1933 and lived the cloistered life in the religious name of \\"Mar√≠a In√©s Teresa of the Blessed Sacrament\\"; her time in the cloistered life lasted until 1949. Espinosa founded ‚Äì on 23 August 1945 ‚Äì the Poor Clare Missionary Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament in Cuernavaca in Morelos and received the papal decree of praise in 1949 and the full approval of Pope Pius XII on 22 June 1951. She received the affectionate name of \\"Manuelita\\". Her next and final order founded was titled the Missionaries of Christ for the Universal Church and was established on 23 November 1979 in Nievo Le√≥n. On 9 December 1980 she had an audience with Pope John Paul II in Rome. Espinosa died in Rome in 1981. Over six thousand of her spiritual writings still remain. Her first order now operates in places such as Ireland and Indonesia while the second operates in Sierra Leone. Beatification Tomb. The beatification process first had to receive the decree that transferred the competent forum from the Diocese of Rome on 20 March 1992 that led to her being titled as a Servant of God on 1 December 1992 under Pope John Paul II once the Congregation for the Causes of Saints granted the official \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') to the cause. The diocesan process that opened in Cuernavaca spanned from 31 October 1992 until 15 October 1996 while Cardinal Camillo Ruini inaugurated another process in Rome that spanned from 25 March 1994 until 26 June 1996. Roman officials validated the diocesan process on 25 October 1997. The official dossier ‚Äì known as the Positio ‚Äì came into the possession of Roman officials in 1999 while a group of theologians voted in favor just under a decade later on 26 September 2008 while the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. voted also to approve the contents of the dossier in a meeting of 17 February 2009. Espinosa was proclaimed to be Venerable on 3 April 2009 after Pope Benedict XVI confirmed that the late religious had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The process for the investigation of an alleged miracle opened in Guadalajara on 26 October 2002 and concluded on 4 November 2002 while later receiving C.C.S. validation on 28 November 2003. The miracle in question involved the 2001 healing of the child Franciscan Javier Carrillo Guzm√°n who had drowned in his pool. The medical board voted in favor of the miracle on 27 May 2010 while a board of theologians followed suit on 15 January 2011; the C.C.S. voted in favor of the miracle as well on 21 June 2011 and passed it onto Benedict XVI on 27 June 2011 for his approval. Espinosa's beatification was celebrated on 21 April 2012 in Mexico. The delegate that presided at the beatification was Cardinal Angelo Amato while Guzm√°n ‚Äì whose miracle led to the beatification ‚Äì presented the relics at the celebration. The apostolic nuncio to Mexico Christophe Pierre and Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera were also in attendance. The current postulator that is assigned to the cause is Sr. Silvia Burnes S√°nchez.

The area is bounded by Godth√•bsvej to the south, Nordre Fasanvej to the east, Borups All√© to the north and the S-train line on the municipal border with Copenhagen to the west. It consists of a mixture of single family detached homes, terraced housing and apartment buildings. History Tram on Mariendalsvej with Lille Godth√•b seen to the right The land originally belonged to Store Godth√•b but was sold to the two new country houses Fuglebakken and Lille Godth√•b in the late 18th century. In about 1900, it was acquired by a consortium and development began when a tram line was extended to a tram loop at present day Kristian Zartmanns Plads in 1905. The central part of the Fuglebakken area was built over with single family detached homes and terraced houses over the next three decades while taller buildings were constructed along its edges. The area between Vagtelvej and the railway in the westernmost part of the area was the site of an industrial zone until the 1960s when the industrial buildings were replaced by 8 large apartment blocks. The area was served by trams from 1905. Landmarks Duevej School Bakkehusene is a large development of terraced housing built in 1928-29 to design by the architect Thorkild Henningsen. It consists of 165 houses and is listed.. Duevej School, a public primary school, opened in 1905 to design by Valdemar Schmidt and is still in use. The main building, gymnastics hall, former principal's residence and school yard are listed. The neighbourhood is also home to a former children's hospital from 1913 which has been converted into apartments. The politician Aksel Larsen also lived in the neighbourhood. On Kristian Zahrtmanns Plads stands a statue of Kristian Zahrtmann. It was created by the sculptor Hans Syberg and unveiled in 1931. Notable people Former prime minister Jens Otto Krag and his wife the actress Helle Virkner lived at Egernvej 61. Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev visited their home during his state visit to Denmark in 1964. Another politician, Aksel Larsen, had his home on Fuglebakkevej for almost 20 years. Other notable residents in the area include the actors Lily Broberg, Paul H√ºtte and Birthe Neumann, the sculptors Gunnar Hammerich and Edvard Eriksen, the painters Albert Naur and Kristian Zahrtmann, writer and painter Mogens Lorentzen, author Henri Nathansen and the composer Niels Viggo Bentzon. Cultural references In Klaus Tothstein's essay Farvel til Fuglebakken (A Farewell to Fuglebakken), published in Weekendavisen on 22 February 2019, he reflects on moving away from the neighbourhood after 25 years.

She competes in S1, SB1 (breaststroke) and SM1 (individual medley) events, swimming with motor function in just one arm. She is a multiple world record holder in her classification. Personal history Thunem was born in Nordfjordeid, Norway in 1989. She was educated at Eid High School before matriculating to University of Troms√∏ where she studied pedagogy. In 2010 Thunem contracted a neurological disease that caused paralysis, primarily in her legs for which she required a wheelchair. In 2012 her condition worsened resulting in further paralysis, this time across the whole right-hand side of her body. Thunem was hospitalized again in 2014, with a blood infection which left her comatose for a period, though she was back in training by the end of the year. Thunem is a lesbian, and revels in her identity as a \\"Dobbel minoritet\\", a double minority. Swimming career Thunem swam avidly as an able body youth, but gave it up at the age of sixteen as she did not want to sacrifice her social life. Thunem returned to swimming as part of her rehabilitation program following her first attack, and found that she had a natural ability for the sport. Initially classified as a S5 disability swimmer, after her condition worsened in 2012 she was re-classified as a S1 competitor, for athletes with the most severe limitations to their natural swimming action. Her first major meet against international competition came at the 28th International German Championships in Berlin in May 2014. There she led the way by recording five new world records, breaking many of them by very large leads. She broke the S1 record in the 50m freestyle by 16 seconds. Her 100m freestyle time of 1:56.95 took 45 seconds from the previous world record, while she took nearly 30 seconds off the 100m backstroke world record (S1), breaking the record in the preliminary heats before lowering the time further in the finals. In the 150m individual medley (SM1) she finished in 3:45.84, three minutes and thirty-three seconds inside the world record. Her achievements at the German Championships saw Thunem named the Female Disability Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World Magazine. Thunem in action during the S2 backstroke at the 2014 European Championships. Thunem followed this a few months later by competing at the 2014 IPC Swimming European Championships in Eindhoven. There were no races organised at the championships for S1 swimmers, so Thunem competed in as many races as possible in the events closest to her classification, even though that meant entering the S4 for both the 50m and 100m freestyle. She won three medals in total, the bronze in the 100m backstroke (S2), and she helped her Norwegian teammates take silver in both the Women's 50m freestyle relay (20 points) and the Women's 50m medley relay (20 points). The following year, Thunem travelled to Glasgow to compete in the 2015 IPC Swimming World Championships. As in the European Championships the year previous, no S1 classification races were contested. Thunem was more selective on this occasion and chose only three events, the 50m backstroke (S2), 100m backstroke (S2) and the 100m breaststroke (SB4). Thunem pulled out of the breaststroke, but she won bronze medals in both of the backstroke events. In the buildup to the 2016 Summer Paralympics Thunem appeared at her second European Championships, this time held in Funchal, Madeira. In the 50m freestyle S2 she won the gold medal, beating her closest rival and S2 competitor, Alexandra Agafonova, by over 12 seconds. Thunem added a silver in the 50m backstroke (S2) and bronze in the 100m backstroke (S2).

The National Museum Act, which was passed in 1998, mandates the conversion of three civic buildings within Rizal Park, the Legislative Building, the Finance Building, and the Tourism Building, into museums. The Finance Building was the first to be repurposed. In 1998, the building was converted into the National Museum of Anthropology. The Legislative Building was converted into the National Museum of Fine Arts in 2000. The Tourism Building would later become the National Museum of Natural History. Tarsier (Inside Philippine National Museum of Natural History) Tamaraw (Inside Philippine National Museum of Natural History) Philippine Eagle (Inside Philippine National Museum of Natural History) In 2013, preparations were commenced to have the building host the National Museum of Natural History. The National Museum of the Philippines invited five architects to submit proposals for the retrofitting and chose the design of the team from Dominic Galicia Architects and interior designer Tina Periquet. Galicia's design involved the maintenance of the building's facade except for the addition of a glass dome supported by a double helix structure inspired by DNA. The dome and supporting structure was dubbed as the \\"Tree of Life\\" and will cover the courtyard of the six-storey building. The project, estimated to cost around , was initially scheduled to be completed in 2015 in time for the 2015 APEC Summit. A bidding for prospective contractors for the renovation of the building was done in September 2015. The National Museum of Natural History was officially inaugurated on September 30, 2017. A grand opening for the museum was expected in the later quarter of 2017. The museum opened on May 18, 2018.

His activities in Charleston, Virginia and the surrounding area heavily assisted the Union Army during the early years of the war. Lewis was later captured and played a part in the trial and execution of fellow agent Timothy Webster.  Early life  Lewis was born in 1831 to a family of wool weavers living in Newton, Wales. As a young man, Lewis had no interest in inheriting the family trade, and in May 1856 emigrated to the United States in search of a new life.Mortimer, p. 4-9 After arriving in America, Lewis got a job as a traveling salesman for the London Printing and Publishing Company which he held for nearly two years until quitting it and moving to Chicago in the spring of 1859. After working there for almost a year as a grocery store clerk, Lewis grew restless again and began to make plans to head west as part of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. A day before he was scheduled to leave Chicago, Lewis encountered an old friend of his who persuaded him to abandon his attempt at prospecting and instead apply for a position with Allan Pinkerton's growing detective agency. This friend arranged an interview with one of Pinkerton's employees, and Lewis began working for the organization in the spring of 1860.Mortimer, p. 10-16  Pre-war work with the Pinkerton agency  After a brief period of training, Pinkerton assigned Lewis to several surveillance jobs throughout the northeastern United States, and in late 1860 invited him to assist in a more in-depth case in New York. The two men bonded over their shared European background and abolitionist sympathies, and in 1861 Pinkerton thought highly enough of Lewis to entrust him with investigating a murder in Jackson, Tennessee. The chief suspect was a respected citizen of the town, and Pinkerton instructed Lewis to travel to Jackson disguised as a \\"gentleman of leisure\\" and gain the suspect's trust to secure information that might assist in building a case against him.Mortimer, p. 21-23 Lewis remained in Jackson for five months, cultivating the appearance of an \\"English gentleman\\" which allowed him to earn the trust of secessionist locals who were more willing to talk to a foreigner than a suspected \\"Yankee.\\" After several meetings with the chief suspect, Lewis determined that he was not guilty of the murder, discovering instead that a local horse thief had killed the victim.Mortimer, p. 38 Lewis left the city on June 9, a day after the state of Tennessee voted to become the eleventh state to secede officially from the Union. Lewis made observations of the strength and number of Confederate troops he encountered during his return trip to Chicago, which he relayed to Pinkerton after relocating to the agency's new headquarters in Cincinnati.Mortimer, p. 39  Mission to Charleston, West Virginia  Pinkerton Spy Pyree Lewis at Supper with Confederate Captain During Lewis' stay in Jackson, Pinkerton had begun gathering intelligence for General George McClellan of the Union Army. Upon his return to Cincinnati, Lewis was assigned to investigate the location and strength of rebel forces in Charleston, Virginia and the surrounding Kanawha Valley area. Lewis would reprise his role as an English noble touring the countryside, accompanied on his journey by Sam Bridgeman, a fellow Pinkerton operative who would pose as his manservant and carriage driver. The two agents set off from Cincinnati on June 27, 1861, traveling in a carriage well-stocked with food, expensive liquor, and a British Army chest strapped prominently to the exterior. After a steamboat trip down the Ohio River and several days' journey along the James River and Kanawha Turnpike, Lewis and Bridgeman were stopped by Confederate soldiers under the command of Colonel George Patton. Lewis was taken to see the colonel at his camp in a nearby farmhouse. Patton received Lewis warmly after hearing his cover story and gave him a full tour of the encampment as well as a pass that would let Lewis continue to Charleston. After dinner and a night of champagne and cigars at the farmhouse, Lewis resumed his journey along the turnpike and arrived in Charleston on June 30.Mortimer, p.39-49 Upon their arrival, Lewis and Bridgeman checked into the Kanawha House Hotel, the headquarters of General Henry Wise, commander of the Confederate forces in the region. Lewis approached Wise in the hope of receiving another pass that would allow the pair to leave Charleston if necessary, but the general refused, and Lewis was forced to write to George Moore, the British consul in Richmond, for permission to travel further. While he waited for Moore's response, Lewis continued to observe rebel movements in and around Charleston, including details of Wise's camp and fortifications at Twomile Creek. On July 10, Wise was called away from Charleston in response to a Union advance near Parkersburg, leaving Colonel Christopher Tompkins in command. Lewis, who had become anxious to depart the city after several incidents in which a drunken Bridgeman confronted Confederate officers, asked the colonel for a travel pass in Wise's absence. Tompkins was not authorized to issue such documents, but he assured Lewis that mentioning the colonel's name would be enough to satisfy most Confederate troops. Lewis and Bridgeman left Charleston on July 12, 1861, and were able to make it back into Union territory after being stopped only once in the village of Logan Court House, Kentucky.Kane, p. 74-86 After returning to Cincinnati, Lewis relayed his information to General Jacob Cox. Acting on Lewis' knowledge of the quality of Wise's troops, Cox was able to overwhelm the rebel fortifications and capture Charleston on July 24.Mortimer, p.77-88  Counterespionage in Washington DC  Lewis played a role in the capture of Confederate spy Rose Greenhow. After their return from Charleston, Lewis and Bridgeman spent some time investigating secessionist activity in Baltimore, before being called to Washington DC to rendezvous with the recently relocated Pinkerton.Mortimer, p. 89-97 Pinkerton had been forming a case against Confederate spy and local socialite Rose Greenhow, and on August 23, 1861, he raided Greenhow's house in the company of Lewis and several other agents. Lewis was responsible for keeping an eye on Greenhow during the search and at one point she attempted to threaten the detective with an uncocked revolver. After the discovery of multiple sources of incriminating information at her residence, Greenhow was put under house arrest, with Lewis remaining at the house as one of her guards. The day after Greenhow's arrest, Pinkerton agents detained the family of U.S. Representative Phillip Phillips on similar spying charges, and the women of the family, including Phillips' wife Eugenia, were relocated to the Greenhow residence and put under Lewis' guard for the remaining weeks Pinkerton had him stationed there.Mortimer, p. 98-108 Following the Greenhow incident, Lewis investigated other suspected rebel sympathizers in Washington including Elizabeth Morton, the wife of Florida Senator Jackson Morton.Mortimer, p. 116-117  Capture  John Winder, who orchestrated Lewis' capture in Richmond. In February 1862, Pinkerton ordered Lewis to travel to Richmond, Virginia, to investigate the status of Timothy Webster and Hattie Lawton, two of Pinkerton's top agents who had ceased communication with the agency. Lewis raised serious objections to the mission, fearing that the number of deported Confederate sympathizers in the city that knew him to be a federal agent would pose a risk to his cover. Pinkerton assured him that the Morton and Phillips families would not be in Richmond during his time there, and Lewis ultimately agreed to the plan, mostly due to his respect and concern for Webster. Pinkerton partnered Lewis with fellow agent and Englishman John Scully for the mission, and the two left the capital on February 18.Mortimer, p. 116-124 Lewis and Scully arrived in Richmond on February 26 and were able to locate Webster and Lawton at the couple's room in the Monumental Hotel. Webster had been confined to his bed by an outbreak of rheumatism and was under close surveillance by members of Richmond's secret police, who had begun to suspect his true identity as a Northern double agent. When Lewis and Scully first entered Webster's room, they found him in the company of P.B. Price, one of Webster's Richmond contacts who still supposed him to be a loyal Confederate. Not wanting to blow Webster's cover, the two returned the following afternoon only to find Webster again with a Southern visitor, Captain Samuel McCubbin of the secret police. McCubbin had been dispatched by Provost Marshal General John Winder to observe Webster and was staying in the room directly opposite from his. After greeting Lewis and Scully, McCubbin explained that since they had crossed the Potomac into Confederate territory, both would have to report to Winder's headquarters as soon as possible.Mortimer, p. 125-140Kane, p. 101-103Markle, p. 69 During their meeting, Winder gave no indication of his suspicions that Lewis and Scully might also be Northern agents, and let the two leave after only asking a few questions about their opinions of the Confederacy and reasons for traveling to Richmond. However, after returning to Webster's room Lewis and Scully were intercepted by one of Winder's agents and Chase Morton, the son of the Morton family Lewis had investigated in Washington. Morton was able to confirm Lewis' identity, and the officer escorted the two men back to Winder's office where the general revealed that he had suspected Lewis all along and promptly arrested the two men on charges of espionage.Mortimer, p. 141-143  Imprisonment  Castle Thunder, where Lewis was imprisoned from August 18, 1862 to September 28, 1863 Winder's men took Lewis and Scully to Henrico County Jail on February 28, and Scully was transferred to Castle Godwin the following day. Lewis remained at Henrico until he and several other inmates staged an escape attempt on March 16. Due to the jail's light security, the group was able to make it north of the Chickahominy River and almost reached the Northern army's front line before being recaptured by Confederate troops on March 19.Mortimer, p. 155-159 Lewis was returned to Richmond and tried by court-martial, after which he joined Scully at Castle Godwin. On April 1, the two were notified that that court-martial had found them both guilty and that they would be hanged in three days.Mortimer, p. 160-164 Lewis was able to get a letter explaining their situation to Fredrick Cridland, the British Acting Consul in Richmond, who agreed to speak with the Southern officials in defense of the two British subjects. On April 3, Cridland arranged a meeting with the Confederate secretary of state Judah Benjamin and secretary of war George Randolph in which he argued that the condemned men had been convicted based on insufficient evidence.Mortimer, p. 167 The secretaries agreed, and on the morning of April 4, hours before he was scheduled to die, Lewis received word that Benjamin had officially postponed his execution to April 12.Mortimer, p. 176-177 During the following week, Lewis was pressured by agents of Winder into making a confession that would incriminate Webster, who had been arrested by Winder's men on similar charges several days after Lewis and Scully's capture. Lewis initially refused but eventually gave in after fearing that Scully had already told the interrogators everything. On April 10, two days before his scheduled date of execution, Lewis met with Judge Advocate William Crump and confessed to him the circumstances of his employment to Pinkerton and the reasons for his trip to Richmond. Lewis made no mention of his previous activity in Charleston and Washington, and would later insist he told the Confederates no more than they already knew. Webster was tried on this information, and both Scully and Lewis made statements during the trial, although records of exactly what information they provided did not survive the war. Webster was executed on April 29, and guards returned the prisoners to Castle Godwin with their executions postponed indefinitely.Mortimer, p. 179-182 Lewis and Scully remained at Castle Godwin until August 18, 1862, when overcrowding necessitated their relocation to Castle Thunder, a newly built prison under the command of Assistant Provost Marshal Captain George Alexander. After currying favor with the captain and writing several letters to Pinkerton in Washington, Lewis and Scully were able to obtain their release in exchange for Confederate prisoners being held by the Union Army. The two were released on September 28, 1863, and arrived in Washington on September 30.Mortimer, p. 201-217  Post-release activity and suicide  The New York World Building, from which Lewis jumped to his death on December 6, 1911 Lewis met with Pinkerton on October 2, resulting in a furious altercation that put an end to their professional relationship. Lewis blamed Pinkerton for his capture and incarceration and refused to accept responsibility for Webster's execution, saying that Pinkerton's poor judgment was the cause of the entire incident. Pinkerton, who had previously forgiven the agents for their involvement in Webster's capture, accused Lewis of treachery and incompetence. The two men never met face-to-face again.Mortimer, p. 222-223 Lewis returned to Washington and worked as a bailiff at Old Capitol Prison until June 1864, when Colonel Lafayette Baker accepted him back into his reorganized military secret service. Lewis worked for Baker until later that year, when he resigned after becoming disillusioned with the organization's corruption. He lived for a time with his brother in Connecticut and returned to Britain in 1865. Lewis returned to America in 1867, and on January 20, 1868, married Maria Thwaites, an acquaintance of the store owner he worked for in Chicago before meeting Pinkerton. In 1871 Maria gave birth to a daughter, Mary, and in 1878 a son, Arthur. The family later moved to New York City, where Lewis had opened up a detective agency of his own. The new organization was highly successful and came into the public eye in 1878 when it was involved in a dispute over the will of Alexander Stewart.Mortimer, p. 224-227 During this time Allan Pinkerton had been working to bring attention to the story of Timothy Webster and in 1884 published The Spy of the Rebellion, in which he presented an embellished account of his agency's activities during the war, including Lewis' trip to Charleston. Pinkerton included in his descriptions an entirely fictional incident in which Lewis became romantically involved with the daughter of a Virginia judge,Pinkerton, p. 217-226 and an unflattering account of Lewis' confession at the hands of rebel authorities.Pinkerton, p. 528-529 Lewis was outraged by his portrayal in the book and tried to contact Pinkerton with corrections, but the publication permanently damaged his reputation and his business suffered as a result. In 1888 Lewis began work on a memoir entitled Pryce Lewis: his adventures as a union spy during the war of the rebellion. A historical narrative. He hoped that the book would set the record straight, but no publisher was willing to accept his manuscript and Lewis eventually abandoned the project.Mortimer p. 228-233 Maria Lewis died in 1901, and Arthur soon joined her in 1903 after living for only 24 years. Mary had moved out of the house and was working as a pottery teacher, leaving Lewis alone in New York. He made a living doing small jobs for friends and acquaintances but was unable to secure aid from the Bureau of Pensions in Washington on account of his foreign citizenship. On December 6, 1911, Lewis committed suicide by jumping from the observation deck of the New York World Building.Mortimer p. 234-237 He was buried in an unmarked grave at Center Cemetery in Torrington, Connecticut. In 2014, the Connecticut Civil War Round Table took up a collection for a grave marker, which residents erected on June 11, 2014.Torrington Register Citizen, June 11, 2014 References Bibliography * Kane, Harnett T.

Campbell bought YourCash, an independent automated teller machine (ATM) provider with operations in the UK, Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland. Before doing this she had previously worked 32 years with the Royal Bank of Scotland Group in various roles, including sales, operational, change, risk and management. In 2016, Campbell sold the business.  Career  Born into a family of bankers, builders and printers, Campbell left school at 16, joining NatWest as a cash-counter and cashpoint filler. She attended night school to study for banking qualifications and on passing her exams, moved to a job in Natwest's head office in London. Following the RBS takeover of NatWest in 2000, Campbell was given a senior role in the operational integration of the two banks. = Banking and YourCash = In 2006 Campbell was appointed Head of Operations at Hanco ATM Systems, a subsidiary of RBS which would eventually become YourCash. Hanco had significantly expanded in a short period of time and was making an annual loss of ¬£7 million. Similar to the role she played in the integration of NatWest and RBS, Campbell was therefore tasked with transforming the business on an operational and cultural level, and in turning it into a profitable business. When the 2007 economic recession caused RBS to initiate the process of selling Hanco, Campbell saw the opportunity to buy the company. The sale was put on hold until 2009, but in mid-2010 Campbell led the first management buyout of Hanco, shortly after renaming the business YourCash. In 2013, Campbell led a successful secondary buy out and the management team acquired 100% of the business through a refinancing agreement. Campbell became YourCash‚Äôs primary stakeholder. Under Campbell‚Äôs guidance, YourCash continued to grow its ATM fleets in the UK and the Netherlands as well as expanding into Belgium and Ireland. In October 2016 the business was acquired by Euronet Worldwide Inc., a global leader in processing secure electronic financial and payment transactions. = Charity and speaking work = Campbell is involved in charities and projects that support entrepreneurs and disadvantaged young people.

In the score program note, Husa wrote, \\"In my previous quartets ‚Äì one of them, No. 2, performed quite extensively by the Fine Arts Quartet ‚Äì I did not preoccupy myself as much with new sonorities as in the new Quartet no. 3. Also, the form of the movements in the former two was rather traditional. The new composition explores some solo predominance, spotlighting the several instruments in rather free forms: the viola in the first movement; violoncello in the second; the two violins in the third.\\" He added, \\"After Bartok, Berg, and Webern, it is not easy to imagine new ways of playing on string instruments. I feel that I have been able to find some unusual paths for bow and finger. As for the rest, I have used all the possibilities hitherto available. The forms of the four movements are few, based mostly on contrasting colors and inner tension.\\" Pulitzer Prize The work won Husa the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Music. The award brought international attention to Czech-born composer, who favorably recalled, \\"You have the confidence that what you are doing is somehow rewarded. That's a terrific feeling, of course. It gives you an incredible lift, and keeps you in a mood so that you can compose more.\\" References Compositions by Karel Husa 1968 compositions Husa, Karel Pulitzer Prize for Music- winning works Music dedicated to ensembles or performers ","title":"String Quartet No. 3 (Husa)"},{"id":"51160388","title":"Phallewal"},{"id":"51160391","text":"Louis-Jean-Nicolas Monmerqu√© (6 December 1780 ‚Äì 27 February 1860) was a 19th- century French magistrate and man of letters.

The album was recorded to raise awareness of tooth decay among children. The album features several notable personalities including Howard Cosell, Frank Sinatra, and Ossie Davis. The album was recorded in the year of the United States Bicentennial, and makes several patriotic references to America's past including the Liberty Bell and Paul Revere. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Recording for Children at the 19th Annual Grammy Awards in 1977. Ali also made a short film on children's dental hygiene, in which Mr Tooth Decay was played by Chuck Wepner. Ali later boxed against Mr. Tooth Decay during Dental Hygiene for Children Day in Washington, D. C. in January 1980. The album was officially approved by the American Dental Association. Reception Frank La Rosa, writing on the website \\"Frank's Vinyl Museum\\" said of the album that \\"I'd heard about this record years ago, and it sounded pretty good. I finally picked up a copy the other day, and ‚Äì sweet jesus ‚Äì this thing is better than anything I could have hoped for. It could be the single best record I own...A sugar high is nothing compared to what I felt listening to this treasure. One track isn't enough. You want to listen to the whole thing straight through, like I did, and you want to do it twice to catch all the details. Then you want to play it in your car. Your walkman. Your bathroom ‚Äì while brushing and flossing your teeth, of course. One thing is for sure, I'll never look at ice cream the same way again.\\" Nate Petrin, writing in VICE magazine, was critical of the performance of the children on the album, feeling that \\"Fans of abysmal kid voice acting‚Äîincluding lots of opposite-of-spontaneous shouting things in unison as a substitute for actual emoting‚Äîwill sink right into this record like a luxurious champagne bath\\". Jason Heller, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, said of the music on the album that \\"At one point, the score sounds like a marching band whose horns have been replaced with glitching analog synths. Elsewhere, some misplaced, Shaft-style blaxploitation funk underlines the narration. At one point, Mr. Tooth Decay's entrance is signaled by a dissonant track that sounds like \\"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\\" as interpreted by avant-garde composer Edgard Var√®se. The most successful song on the album is Ali's own theme, a brassy, fist-pumping anthem that vaguely parallels the theme from Rocky, also released in 1976\\". Plot The album opens with \\"Ali's Historical Theme Song\\", a musical number featuring Ali, before the story (narrated by Howard Cosell) begins. The plot of the story involves Ali training for an upcoming fight against \\"Mr. Tooth Decay\\", who is accompanied by sidekicks, Sugar Cuber and Willie Plaque. Ali then rescues a group of children from buying ice cream from a shopkeeper (played by Frank Sinatra), and takes the children to an organic farm where they learn the importance of drinking milk and eating fruit and vegetables from farmer Brother St. John (played by Ossie Davis). The album concludes with the fight between Ali and Mr. Tooth Decay.

Written by ABC journalists Caro Meldrum-Hanna and Elise Worthington, and reported by Meldrum-Hanna, the episode depicted the treatment of minors at the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre, located in the Northern Territory. Accompanied with graphic footage, the episode documented the experiences of individuals as they stayed at the centre's \\"Behavioural Management Unit\\" (BMU) maximum security cells, set in a timeline from 2010 to 2015. It featured interviews with Northern Territory Minister for Correctional Services John Elferink, various lawyers, and both former Northern Territory Children's Commissioner Dr. Howard Bath and current Commissioner Colleen Gwynne. Background Summary The Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre, where the episode's subjects, Roper, Austral, Rogan and Voller, were held. \\"Australia's Shame\\" follows the experiences of Jake Roper, Ethan Austral, Kenny Rogan and Dylan Voller at the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre, a maximum security prison located in Berrimah, Northern Territory. The episode cold opens with footage of a shirtless Voller, strapped and cuffed to a mechanical restraint chair, with his head covered by a spit mask in Alice Springs (adult) correctional centre after attempting to self harm, he had been transferred that day after threatening behaviour in the juvenile centre. he had previously requested of his own volition with the assistance of his lawyer and approved by a magistrate to be placed in the adult centre only to return after another juvenile requested relief from darwin adult prison from the NT supreme court returning them both to juvenile correctional centres. Presenter Sarah Ferguson introduces the episode by explaining to the viewer, \\"the image you've just seen isn't from Guantanamo Bay or Abu Ghraib, but Australia in 2015.\\" After the traditional introduction, the episode, narrated and reported by Caro Meldrum-Hanna, begins with footage of the Behavioural Management Unit (BMU) cells at the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre in August 2014, when Roper breaks free from his cell and starts attempting to break out of the building with dis-attached light fixtures, while his cellmates watch on. Meldrum-Hanna explains that Roper had been kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, for 15 days straight, describing Roper as \\"having lost all sense of time\\" and \\"deeply distressed\\". Prison authorities are then seen spraying tear gas into the room, affecting Roper and all his cellmates, before all being dragged outside, held on the ground and sprayed with water. The episode continues with interviews with former Northern Territory Children's Commissioner Dr. Howard Bath, North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency Lawyer Jared Sharp, and solicitor Peter O'Brien, who all give a description of the BMU cells at Don Dale, where children are kept for up to 24 hours a day, with no running water, no air conditioner, no fans, and no direct air supply. Contemporary media coverage of the August 2014 incident at Don Dale is shown, reporting a false account of the incident by the authorities, who stated that all of the cellmates had started a riot and armed themselves with metal bars and broken glass. The Northern Territory Minister for Correctional Services John Elferink is seen reaffirming the false account of the incident in a media report. Meldrum-Hanna declares that \\"prison authorities weren't telling the truth.\\" Jake Roper is the first of the boys from Don Dale to be interviewed by Meldrum-Hanna, who described his feelings during his tenure at Don Dale as \\"angry at some times, depressed at [other] times\\", and that he had \\"felt alone\\". Roper had been sent to Don Dale in June 2014, after he had stolen a car while he was homeless. He then later escaped along with four other detainees, only for all of them, including Roper, to be recaptured and then put into the BMU cells. Roper also describes constantly being reminded of his time at Don Dale, a feeling shared by fellow detainee Ethan Austral, who was also interviewed by Meldrum-Hanna, albeit through a Skype call. Austral, who stayed in the BMU cells the same time as Roper, stated that \\"sometimes, when I wake up, I'll be there, in the same spot.\\" Austral was frequently jailed and released from Don Dale for a series of burglaries and car thefts since he was 11 years old. Reaction =Q&A;= A broadcast of the live panel discussion program Q&A; immediately followed the broadcast of \\"Australia's Shame\\" on the ABC, and featured Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science Craig Laundy, Australian Labor Party MP Ed Husic, President of the Human Rights Commission Gillian Triggs, Shireen Morris of the Cape York Institute, and Reverend Peter Kurti of the Centre for Independent Studies, all of whom had viewed the episode shortly before Q&A; went to air. Ed Husic described the feelings of the panel shortly after viewing the episode, recounting that \\"there was silence in the room after we watched it and I just felt a deep sense of indignation that it just didn't seem like anyone had really been moved to a point of action.\\" On the program, Triggs was questioned first by host Virginia Trioli about the episode, to which she described the treatment of the children as seen in the episode as \\"absolute horror\\", noting that she \\"had visited many detention centres and, sadly, [had] never seen conditions of that kind and I have never seen people treated in that way.\\" Triggs also expressed the need for \\"some kind of investigation into this.\\" Laundy, Husic, Morris and Kurti all agreed with Triggs, with Laundy concurring with the opinion of Barrister Lawrence in the episode, stating that he would inform \\"both the Prime Minister and the relevant Ministers about what we've seen and what we can do.\\" Laundy additionally expressed that \\"all of that footage should be handed over to the State Government so that they can go through the footage in its entirety and help them make the decisions they need to make.\\" =Government response= The airing of the episode comes only a month before the 2016 Northern Territory general election, to be held on 27 August 2016. Political analysts have predicted that the airing of the episode will put the incumbent Country Liberal Party \\"under even more pressure\\", after conceding defeat in the Northern Territory in June's federal election. Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and Country Liberal leader Adam Giles, in a statement released hours after the airing of the episode, condemned the situation in places such as the Done Dale Detention Centre as \\"a shocking state of affairs\\", concurring with Gillian Triggs' comments on Q&A;, and encouraging a Royal Commission be set up to investigate places such as Don Dale. Despite the condemnation of the actions seen in the episode, Giles assured \\"full confidence\\" custodial officers in the Northern Territory, stating that \\"they have a challenging and difficult job, one that not many people wish to do. To those officers I want to say, you have my full support for the work that you do in upholding our laws.\\" In the political fallout shortly following the broadcast of \\"Australia's Shame\\", John Elferink was sacked by Giles as the Northern Territory Minister for Correctional Services, with Giles taking over the portfolio indefinitely. Elferink will, however, retain all his other portfolios in the Giles Ministry, including Attorney-General of the Northern Territory, and Minister for Justice. After consulting Adam Giles, Senator George Brandis, Minister for Indigenous Affairs Nigel Scullion and Gillian Triggs, Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull officially announced that there would be a Royal Commission into the Northern Territory juvenile detention system the morning after the episode aired, on 26 July 2016. Turnbull stated on ABC Radio that the Royal Commission would be set up \\"as soon as possible\\" and the relevant parties would make moves \\"very quickly\\". He further stated that \\"Like all Australians, we are shocked by the report, by that evidence on Four Corners last night. We have moved swiftly to get to the bottom of it. We need to get all the facts out as quickly as we can. We need to expose the cultural problems, the administrative problems that allowed this type of mistreatment to occur.\\" When questioned about whether or not the Northern Territory government itself should be investigated, Turnbull pressed that \\"the important thing is to get to the bottom of what happened at Don Dale.\\" References ;Notes ;Citations External links *\\"Australia's Shame\\" on the Four Corners website Four Corners (Australian TV program) ","title":"Australia's Shame"},{"id":"51160541","text":"Craig Pittman is an American journalist and author of four books.

It seeks to promote the traditional family, in particular by amending the Constitution of Romania to define marriage as \\"the union between a man and a woman, a process that will have no juridical effect whatsoever, being just a waste of energy and money\\". It is also involved in the anti-abortion movement. In 2016, 'Coali»õia pentru familie' gathered 3 million signatures in favor of replacing \\"spouses\\" with \\"a man and a woman\\" in article 48 of the Romanian constitution. Immediately after the 3 million signatures were submitted to the Romanian Parliament, an open letter was published in the support of LGBT community, signed by 1000 public figures (including film producers, pop singers, people from the fashion industry, artists, intellectuals). The letter of support soon became an online petition raised over 10.000 more signatures. The American evangelical Christian organization Liberty Counsel and Alliance Defending Freedom International have both publicly supported the initiative and have submitted briefs to the Constitutional Court in support of a referendum. The Romanian Orthodox Church also announced its official support for the initiative in mid- January 2016. In July 2016, the Constitutional Court issued a unanimous ruling that allows the referendum proposal to move forward. In response, LGBT advocacy groups, like Accept, MozaiQ and TRANSform, expressed dissatisfaction with CCR‚Äôs decision, claiming that it could lead \\"to a rise in social tensions and hate crimes\\". On July 20, 2016, right after the Constitutional Court released its decision allowing the initiative to ban gay marriage in the Constitution to move forward, the LGBT community reacted and organized an unauthorized protest in University Square in Bucharest, with an attendance of 50. Under Romanian law, the constitution can be changed after a proposal by the president, the government, a quarter of the members of the Parliament of Romania or at least 500,000 citizens. Parliament must then approve the revision, which must then pass a nationwide referendum. The coalition's efforts to amend the constitution have been ongoing since 2013, when Amnesty International helped defeat a similar amendment. However, it participated in a successful campaign against the introduction of civil partnerships into law. Other proposals presented by the coalition include the taxation of celibacy, the banning of adoptions by single parents and the active discouragement of sexual intercourse between unmarried persons. The initiative was approved by the Senate on 11 September 2018 and the Romanian constitutional referendum took place on 6 and 7 October 2018, failing due to insufficient turnout.  Controversies and criticism  The coalition bills itself as an independent civic initiative, unaffiliated to any religion. However, among its 43 listed members, many share strong political and religious views. Southern Poverty Law Center calls the association \\"a nebulous umbrella group of local rightwing organizations\\" and raises concerns over the involvement of American anti-LGBT groups, such as Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), Liberty Counsel, World Congress of Families (WCF) and \\"European Center of Law and Justice\\" (ECLJ), who \\"filed legal briefs, lobbied or campaigned in favor of the change\\". APOR (The Association for Parents pro Religious Courses) is at the top of the list, which successfully campaigned for religious classes in schools, and has its headquarters in the social center of The Archdiocese of Bucharest. Other religious NGOs are ‚ÄûVladimir Ghika‚Äù - The Association of Romanian Catholic Families, Association Ieromonah Arsenie Boca, several Christian-Orthodox associations and an Orthodox news website called \\"LƒÉca»ôuri Ortodoxe\\". Pro Vita Bucure»ôti and Alian»õa Familiilor are two other notable members with a strong pro-life stance, which also favor conversion therapy treatments. An internal document from Pro Vita, which presents its political agenda for Romania, deems sexual minorities \\"morally inferior\\", and states that divorce, same-sex marriage, abortion (even for rape cases), and contraception do not pertain to the individual's private life. Pro Vita seeks to \\"impose authentic moral principles\\" based on a \\"God-given natural law\\" onto society at large, including all those who oppose their views. The Romanian Accept and Mozaiq organizations have been highly critical of the initiative and have raised concerns about its members. Accept draws attention to the fact that Mihai Gheorghiu, who is leading the initiative group, is also one of the main instigators of the 2013 \\"homophobic attack\\" at a public cinema. The U.S. Embassy has also accused Mihai Gheorghiu of organizing the anti-LGBT protest at said location, where attendees wielded signs reading \\"Die Faggots\\" and made Nazi salutes. Pro Vita Bucure»ôti organisation is led by Bogdan Stanciu who also managed the Romanian branch of AlterMedia before 2007, an international extremist network founded by American white nationalist and former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke. Stanciu was a member of Noua DreaptƒÉ between 2000 and 2005, a nationalist far-right organization linked to physical attacks against gays. He now denies any connections with the party. Stanciu is also the founder of the \\"Eurosceptic\\", an anti-EU and anti-immigration blog. Accept says Stanciu has close ties to Aleksandr Dugin, a Russian political scientist known for his fascist views. Peter Costea, the founder of Alian»õa Familiilor, was one of the coordinators of the first initiative to amend the Constitution to define marriage as \\"the union between a man and a woman\\" back in 2006. As his website states, it was done \\"with the help of affluent religious personalities in Romania\\". There are also strong concerns about the rising hate crimes against gays and the stigmatization of the LGBT community due to the campaign against same sex marriage. Romania‚Äôs president, Klaus Iohannis, the then Prime Minister Dacian Ciolo»ô and socialist leader Liviu Dragnea have clashed over the rights of same-sex couples in the country. In a speech in October 2016, Klaus Iohannis has called for tolerance and acceptance for minorities as the country considers banning same-sex marriage, noting he himself was part of two minorities as he is ethnically German and Lutheran, in a primarily Christian Orthodox country. Dacian Ciolo»ô voiced his support for the ‚Äòtraditional family‚Äô, while Liviu Dragnea declared himself to be a religious fanatic. On October 7, 2016 the Parliament was set to debate a potential referendum which would see citizens vote on whether the constitution should define marriage as between a man and a woman, but it has decided to postpone the issue until after the upcoming elections. On November 19, 2016, the LGBT community in Bucharest organized a march with over 500 people in attendance, right in the middle of the campaign for the parliamentary elections, when the issue of gay marriage had become one of the topics debated. Right after the LGBT march on November 19, titled ‚ÄúGod Doesn‚Äôt Do Politics‚Äù, one of the LGBT activists who helped organize the event, received death threats over the phone. 47 organizations and other 2000 people have asked the Judicial Committee from the Chamber of Deputies for an alternative legal protection of couples through civil union. In October 2017 Coali»õia pentru Familie and Liberty Counsel toured Romania with Kim Davis, the person who refused to legalize a same-sex marriage in USA, pushing the message that \\"religious persecution\\" would be the fate of the Romanian people if same sex marriage was passed.

His first faculty position was at Stanford University (1970-1989) where he rose to full professor in the Department of Medicine and focused on basic molecular biology and gene expression. In 1988, the University of Southern California (USC) recruited Kedes to spearhead a campus-wide initiative to strengthen their molecular biology and genetics research programs. At USC, Kedes conceived and developed the Institute of Genetic Medicine, becoming its founding director (1989-2008) as well as the William Keck Professor (1988-2009) and Chair (1988-2002) of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Education Kedes attended Weaver High School, in Hartford, Connecticut and then earned his BS in Biology from Stanford University in 1961 after completing 3 years (1957-1959) of undergraduate studies at Wesleyan University (Connecticut), which later recognized him as a Distinguished Alumnus, awarding him an honorary bachelor's of arts degree (2009). Kedes earned his medical degree from Stanford University Medical School (1958-1962) and then completed his internship and junior year of residency in internal medicine at the University of Pittsburgh (1962-1964), followed by two years of research at the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Biology Branch, within the National Cancer Institute (1964-1966). Following a senior residency year at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Kedes joined the laboratory of Paul R. Gross at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, completing his postdoctoral research fellowship. Supported by a Leukemia Society award, he then worked for one year (1969-1970) in Europe, most notably with embryologist, Alberto Monroy, and molecular biologist Max Birnstiel. Career Kedes was recruited to Stanford University (1970-1989), where he rose to the rank of full professor and became that institution's first investigator supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (1974-1982). While at Stanford, he was a founder of IntelliGenetics (later IntelliCorp) (1980-1987), the first company focused on designing and applying computer programs, expert systems, and artificial intelligence to the analysis of DNA sequences. There, Kedes held the positions of Senior Scientist and Chairman. In 1989, Kedes moved to USC where he conceptualized, obtained extramural funding for, and oversaw the design and building of the Institute of Genetic Medicine. The institute followed a collaboratory model and Kedes recruited 20 faculty to the IGM during his tenure as its founding director. He also served as Scientific Director and Co-Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board for the Archon X PRIZE in Genomics (2005-2013) and was the Weston Visiting Professor at the Weitzmann Institute (2009), Following his retirement from USC, Kedes served as Interim Director of Medical Genetics at Cedars Sinai Medical Center (2012-2014). Kedes has authored over 220 papers, reviews, and book chapters. His published work has over 23,000 citations with 2 papers receiving over 1000 citations each and over 45 receiving over 100 citations each, as of 2016.

Neufeld Memorial Award (Israel) *University of Southern California Distinguished Faculty Service Award (2004) *Scientific Director of the X PRIZE Foundation Research and scientific contributions Kedes is an internationally recognized expert in the field of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle molecular genetics with scientific contributions to molecular biology and gene expression that spanned over four decades. Among his scientific achievements was the first isolation of a protein-coding gene from an animal cell, and he was the first to determine the DNA sequence of a protein coding animal gene. His initial research focused on understanding the chromosomal arrangement, sequences, and regulation of the multi-gene family encoding histone proteins, which later proved to play a central role in controlling overall gene expression, including the formation of eu- and heterochromatin (see histone code). The second phase of his research delved into the study of the regulation of actin genes, another multi-gene family. During this period, Kedes recognized evolutionarily conserved elements within non-coding regions of the 3' ends of mRNAs, and predicted that these regions were likely targets of post-transcriptional regulation, which later proved to be correct (see, for example, MicroRNA, AU-rich element, Three prime untranslated region). In the third phase of his research, Kedes turned his attention to muscle gene expression and myocyte differentiation and transdifferentiation, including early forays into cardiac gene therapy. He was also a developer of the first federally funded digital Web based database for storing and analyzing DNA sequences, laying the foundation, along with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, for the development of subsequent NIH databases, including GenBank at the NCBI. Seeing the need to develop sophisticated expert systems to analyze increasingly complex sets of DNA databases, Kedes initiated collaborations with fellow Stanford University molecular biologist Douglas Brutlag and computer scientists Peter Friedland and Edward Feigenbaum and sought and obtained federal funding to establish a pre-internet era resource to share openly both the DNA sequence data and the mainframe computer aided analysis software in a program that they named Bionet. These four faculty, together, formed Intelligenetics, which was the first entity that managed Bionet. Personal life The son of Rosalyn and Samuel Kedes, Larry Kedes was born in Hartford, Connecticut. He married Shirley Beck in 1958. They have three children, Dean Kedes (born 1960), Maureen Kedes (born 1962), and Todd Kedes (born 1966). He had a younger sister, Judith Kedes (1941 ‚Äì 2016).

He taught as professor of German at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1948 to 1984.  Biography  J√°szi was born in Budapest into a distinguished family of assimilated Jews. His father, Oszk√°r J√°szi, was a sociologist, historian, and politician who served as Minister of Nationalities in Mih√°ly K√°rolyi's cabinet during the Hungarian Democratic Republic of 1918‚Äì19 before moving to the United States in 1925 to join the faculty of Oberlin College as Professor of Political Science. Andrew J√°szi‚Äôs mother, Anna Lesznai, was a well-known artist and writer. After his parents‚Äô divorce in 1919, J√°szi moved with his mother and brother George (1915‚Äì1992) to Vienna, where he received his primary school education. This was followed by a return to Budapest in 1931 and enrollment in the Deutsche Oberschule (‚ÄúGerman High School‚Äù).Hinrich Seeba, \\"Andrew O. J√°szi,\\" Internationales Germanisten-Lexikon 1800‚Äì1950, 3 vol., Christoph K√∂nig, ed. (Berlin, New York: de Gruyter 2003), pp. 841-842. As was typical of those of his background, he was raised bilingual in Hungarian and German, though German remained the primary language of his intellectual work throughout his life. He finished high school in 1935, then came to the United States to join his father at Oberlin where he earned his B.A. in German in 1938. From there, he went to Harvard to begin his doctoral studies. Drafted into the U.S. army in 1942, he was dispatched to serve as an intelligence officer with the occupation forces in Germany.Seeba, pp. 841-842. J√°szi completed his Ph.D. in German at Harvard in 1947. He was hired the following year by the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught classes in German literature until his retirement in 1984. He died at his home in Oakland, California, in 1998.  Academic career  J√°szi enjoyed a campus-wide reputation as an outstanding teacher. Recognized as ‚Äúone of the most respected critics of German literature in the United States‚Äù as well as ‚Äúone of the most beloved professors of the University,‚ÄùSandra Larson, \\"Faculty Profile: Andrew Jaszi of the German Department burns with an idealism that purifies,\\" California Monthly, November 1966, pp. 18-19. he developed an original style of teaching that was rigorous yet also accessible to the non-specialist. Methodologically, he favored what has been termed ‚Äúan ontological approach‚Äù;Larson, 18. pedagogically, he incorporated Socratic dialogue and what, for lack of a better word, may be called ‚Äúlecture.‚Äù\\"Some say a J√°szi lecture is like a poem, others a prayer. His manner while lecturing often resembles a person protected from external reality by a trance-like shell. The intensity of his concentration is felt by everyone in the room.\\" Larson, 18-19. In all this, he brought to his classes, and was capable of eliciting from his students, an exceptional degree of personal engagement. Among his former students who have credited his influence are W. Michael Blumenthal,W. Michael Blumenthal, In achtzig Jahren um die Welt. Mein Leben. (Berlin: Ullstein Buchverlage, 2012), p. 195.

J√°szi was a well-known authority on Goethe. Other authors he specialized in were Kleist, ETA Hoffmann, Rilke, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Kafka. His scholarly research also extended more broadly, leading to courses on nineteenth- and twentieth-century poetry and drama, fairy tales, and psychological approaches to literature (especially Jung). In addition to teaching at Berkeley, J√°szi held positions as visiting professor at the University of Washington (1959‚Äì60), Harvard (1960), University of Colorado (1963) and University of Michigan (1965). In recognition of his achievements, he was awarded the Berkeley Citation, one of the campus‚Äôs highest honors, in 1984.  Philosophical work  Alongside his career as Professor of German Literature, J√°szi spent much of his adult life working on a massive philosophical project dealing with fundamental questions of being and knowing, especially‚Äîbut not only‚Äîin the area of aesthetics. These investigations, phenomenological in nature and method, treat such concepts as being, consciousness, time and space, change and motion, identity and difference, subject and object, part and whole.

Tomas Gunnarsson is a Swedish feminist and gender identity activist, blogger and photographer known for his critical campaigns against sexist photographic portrayal of women. Gunnarsson began blogging as Genusfotografen (\\"the Gender Photographer\\") and became widely known in Sweden in 2012 when he was forced to pay damages for copyright infringement due to a critical blog post about the imagery used in an interview with Swedish chef Louise Johansson in Xpress, the onboard magazine of the train service Arlanda Express. The controversy raised by Gunnarsson led to a wider public debate about sexist portrayal of women as well as lack of legal protection for bloggers who use copyrighted works in critical reviews. Since the 2012 dispute, Gunnarsson's campaigns and blog posts have been widely publicized in Swedish media for raising awareness of stereotypical photographic portrayal of women in media and advertisement. He is particularly well known for criticizing the US clothing retailer American Apparel and the Danish fishing magazine Fisk & Fri. He has also been involved in developing awareness within public and private organizations regarding gender-neutral imagery.  Copyright dispute  Gunnarsson received media attention in 2012 after a critical review of photographs in an article of the June 2011 issue of Xpress, the English-language onboard magazine of Arlanda Express, the airport train serving Stockholm-Arlanda Airport. The article was an interview with Louise Johansson, the 2011 winner of Sveriges m√§sterkock, a TV reality show based on the British original MasterChef. The photographs accompanying Johansson's interview showed her in a restaurant kitchen in a light, colorful dress, washing her bare feet in a sink and playfully drinking water from a spray nozzle. Gunnarsson's blog post featured detailed criticism of the imagery, along with photos of the magazine itself, pointing to the disparity in how female professionals were depicted compared to their male counterparts. The photo agency Spectacular Stuido that represented Stefan Jellheden, the photographer who produced the images for Xpress article, threatened to sue Gunarsson for copyright infringement for publishing without consent from the copyright holder. The agency demanded that he pay 25,000 kronor in damages for unauthorized use of copyright works. Eric Legge, the owner of Spectacular Studios also started a group that criticized Gunnarsson's actions on Facebook. In Sweden, copyrighted works may be used in reviews and critical reviews without consent from the copyright holder under the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression. The exception only applies to publications with an officially registered \\"responsible editor\\" (ansvarig utgivare), something that Gunnarsson's blog lacked. The issue was settled out of court with Gunnarsson agreeing to pay 15,000 kronor in damages. The legal actions by Spectacular Studios were widely criticized by Swedish journalists, legal experts and the Swedish Association of Professional Photographers, and sparked a public debate about the lack of protection for freedom of speech for bloggers and social media activists in Sweden. Gunnarsson received widespread popular support after the dispute was publicized in media. A request for financial aid to pay the damages that he posted on his blog was fulfilled within 24 hours, amassing a total of 19,000 kronor. The owner of Spectacular Studios defended the legal action as legitimate copyright protection, while Louise Johansson stated that she regretted the photos and welcomed the debate about sexist portrayal of women in media. The head of marketing for Arlanda Express later sent an e-mail to Gunnarsson, apologizing for the images in the interview and thanking him for his review. Fisk og Fri In January 2013, Gunnarsson published criticism on his blog of the Danish fishing magazine Fisk & Fri for its use of photos of nude or scantily-clad women together with dead fish. Gunnarsson was threatened with legal action for copyright infringement by Jens Bursell, the editor-in-chief of Fisk & Fri. Swedish media reported on Gunnarsson's analysis and criticized the response from magazine as well as the lack of protection afforded to the free speech of bloggers by Swedish legislation.

In 2016 the CWLA has about 83,000 members in over 1,200 parish councils across Canada. The League's national office is in Winnipeg, Manitoba; it is federally incorporated, and is a registered not-for-profit membership association. The League does not have registered charitable status. Membership is predominantly Catholic women aged 16 and older, but associate membership exists for non-Catholics. There is a parish-based Catholic Girls' League for members 10 to 15 years of age.  History  = Founding = The Catholic Women's League was founded in England in 1906 by Miss Margaret Fletcher. The Canadian organization was founded in 1920 after Katherine Hughes of Edmonton brought news of the British organization to Bishop Emile Legal in Canada. Legal called upon Hughes and Abb√© Casgrain to set up an organization to help immigrant women and girls who were seeking work in Edmonton. The organization's first meeting was in November 1912, and as a result a job placement service was set up and Rosary Hall was opened, to provide safe and affordable accommodation. During the next few years, a number of separate women's groups were established, based on The Catholic Women's League in England: Montreal in 1917, Toronto in 1918 and Halifax in 1919. = The early years and first national executive = A study group in Montreal known as the Loyola Club became a Catholic Women's Club in 1917, organized by Margaret Jones, with first president Bellelle Guerin. This club became the Montreal City Subdivision in 1920, and claimed the founding subdivision. At this time all nationally organized women's groups were called to Ottawa to share their opinions with the minister of Reconstruction & Immigration concerning the settling of thousands of immigrants arriving in Canada from war-ravaged Europe. Members of the Montreal Catholic Women's Club, noting that there was no national group of Catholic women, set out to organize one. In March, 1920, invitations were sent to the various Catholic women's groups in Canada, including Hamilton, St. Catharines and Saint John, offering to host a meeting in Montreal for this purpose. The conference was held on June 17, 1920, with delegates from Edmonton, Regina, Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa, Sherbrooke, Saint John and Halifax. Bellelle Guerin, president of the Montreal CWL, was asked to be chairman of the conference. An executive was elected, organizational details ironed out, and future activities were discussed. The new League's first act was to send a petition to the federal government asking or stricter divorce laws in Canada. In 1921 the League chose a motto, For God and Canada. At the annual national convention in 1923 in Halifax, a resolution was passed to adopt Our Lady of Good Counsel as the League's patroness. In December of that year the CWLC was granted federal incorporation. During World War II, the League raised $25,000 for the war effort and sent more than 7 million cigarettes to the soldiers overseas. In 1947 the constitution of the CWLC was altered to ensure more clerical supervision of the League's activities, and to set up councils at parish, diocesan and provincial levels. As of 2015, the Catholic Women's League of Canada had 83,990 members. Organization = Councils = As well as the national council, there are 11 provincial councils ‚Äî one of each of the 10 provinces, which includes territories, and a military ordinariate, which was granted provincial status in 1965‚Äî\\"Speaker offers insight into importance of hospice palliative care during address to Catholic Women's League provincial delegates\\" .

There is also a Communications committee which facilitates The Canadian League magazine and other publications.  League Work  The League supports women's programs in developing countries through MaterCare International, the Coady International Institute and the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace, and has raised millions of dollars for local, national and international charities.

Micaloviƒá printed books based on the agreements he concluded with Petar ≈†u≈°iƒá. ≈†u≈°iƒá paid 108 golden ducats for printing while Micaloviƒá prepared Cyrillic script types and organized printing of prayer books in Venice in 1512. These prayer books are known as Molitvenik and Officio. Micaloviƒá was obliged to collect printed books and to sell them in his shop which he was to open in Dubrovnik and in Ottoman Serbia. In 1510 and 1513 documents signed by Micaloviƒá, the language of the prayer book was referred to as \\"in littera et idiomate serviano\\" (). In sources the language of these prayer books and script in which it is printed is referred to as Bosnian, Ragusan, Serbian, Croatian or Serbo-Croatian, depending on the point of view of its authors.  Family  Fraƒçnesko's birth name was Ivan or Jovan. His grandfather was a book trader. Fraƒçnesko's father was Ratko Vukosaliƒá whose nickname was Micaloviƒá.

It is possible that Franƒçesko learned the skill of melting metal and engraving from his father-in-law, so he was able to prepare types for printing books on presses that belonged to Rusconi in 1512.: \\"Ratkovic era genero di un maestro orafo, Pavel Antoevic; da costui Ratkovic potrebbe aver appreso l'arte di incidere e fondere i metalli.

Mihailo Diniƒá discovered in Ragusan archives that Micaloviƒá signed two contracts in his attempt to publish Cyrillic script books for Ragusan Catholics.Anica Nazor: Hrvatski ƒáiriliƒçki molitvenik iz 1512. godine, FILOLOGIJA 62(2014), 17‚Äî31 Micaloviƒá and ≈†u≈°iƒá signed the first contract with Girolamo Soncino in Pesaro on 28 September 1510. It was agreed that Girolamo would print in his printing house several prayer books on Cyrillic script. On 31 July 1511 Micaloviƒá signed an agreement with Petar ƒêuro ≈†u≈°iƒá in which Micaloviƒá's name appears as Franƒçesko. According to this agreement Micaloviƒá and ≈†u≈°iƒá established a company in which Micaloviƒá invested his labor (personam suam) and contract he signed earlier with Soncino, while ≈†u≈°iƒá invested 108 golden ducats.¬ªTim ugovorom Micalovic i Su≈°iƒá sklopi≈°e na neograni√∂eno vrijeme druStvo, u koje prvi ulozi svoj rad (personam suam) i ugovor sklopljen 28 septembra g. 1510 sa Stamparom Jeronimom Son√∂inom (Soncino) u Pezaru po kojem je ovaj imao ... It was agreed that printed books were to be collected by Micaloviƒá who was obliged to distribute them in Dubrovnik (in a small shop he was to open for this purpose) and Serbia. On 20 August 1513 Micaloviƒá began his journey into the Ottoman controlled territory of the Balkans to sell prayer books he printed. On that date Micaloviƒá and ≈†u≈°iƒá signed another contract in which Micaloviƒá was obliged to return to ≈†u≈°iƒá all the money he received from selling prayer books.Anica Nazor: Hrvatski ƒáiriliƒçki molitvenik iz 1512. godine, FILOLOGIJA 62(2014), 17‚Äî31  Cyrillic script Catholic prayer books  In 1512 Micaloviƒá printed two Catholic prayer books in Venice, in the printing house of Giorgio Rusconi (Zorzi Ruskoni) from Milano. One book is known as Officio (Officio Beatae Mariae Virginis) and the other as Molitvenik (Officio Sanctae Brigittae). Both books were printed in Cyrillic script with elements of Glagolitic in Shtokavian dialect after being translated from Chakavian.: \\"Franjo Ratkoviƒá Micaloviƒá (Franciscus Ratchi Mizalovich) i sam Dubrovƒçanin. ... da je Molitvenik dubrovaƒçko ≈°tokavsko-jekavski spomenik unatoƒç tomu ≈°to se u njemu nalaze tragovi ƒçakavsko-ikavske redakcije iz koje je potekao.\\" On 18 September 1512, immediately after his return to Ragusa, Micaloviƒá stated that two cases of Slavic books belonged to ƒêuro, father of Petar ≈†u≈°iƒá.: \\"–û—Å–∞–º–Ω–∞–µ—Å—Ç–æ–≥ —Å–µ–ø—Ç–µ–º–±—Ä–∞ 1512 –∏–∑—ò–∞–≤–∏–æ —ò–µ –ú–∏—Ü–∞–ª–æ–≤–∏—õ, —á–∏–º —ò–µ –ø—Ä–∏—Å–ø–µ–æ —É –î—É–±—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫, –¥–∞ –¥–≤–∞ —Å–∞–Ω–¥—É–∫–∞ —Å–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∫—ö–∏–≥–∞ (in idiomate Sclavo) –ø—Ä–∏–ø–∞–¥–∞—ò—É –Ç—É—Ä–∏ –®—É—à–∏—õ—É, –æ—Ü—É –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–∞ –∫–æ—ò–∏ —ò–µ —Å–∫–ª–æ–ø–∏–æ –ø—Ä–≤–∏ —É–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä —Å–∞ –ú–∏—Ü–∞–ª–æ–≤–∏—õ–µ–º, –∏—Å—Ç–æ ...\\" The four-part icon from church in the Orthodox Monastery of Virgin Mary's Birth in village Sogle, ƒåa≈°ka Municipality (near Veles, North Macedonia) have decorative elements painted under influence of Cyrillic Molitvenik printed by Micaloviƒá. According to Dejan Medakoviƒá, renaissance decorative elements of this 16th- century icon are directly copied from Molitvenik printed by Micaloviƒá.  Polemics about the language  These two books were rediscovered to the scientific public in 1932 which initially referred to the language of these prayer books as Serbian language. In the contract signed by Micaloviƒá the language of the prayer book was referred to as \\"in littera et idiomate serviano\\" ().Anica Nazor: Hrvatski ƒáiriliƒçki molitvenik iz 1512. godine, FILOLOGIJA 62(2014), 17‚Äî31 Milan Re≈°etar performed detailed analysis of the letters, content, style and language of the prayer book and concluded that it is the first book printed on Serbian vernacular language because Oktoih (printed in 1494) was printed in Church Slavonic language.Anica Nazor: Hrvatski ƒáiriliƒçki molitvenik iz 1512. godine, FILOLOGIJA 62(2014), 17‚Äî31: \\"ali mali molitvenik ≈°to ga je g. 1512. izdao Dubrovƒçanin Franƒçesko (Franjo) Ratkoviƒá ima prema njima tu veliku prednost da je srpski i po jeziku, dok su obje Crnojeviƒáeve knjige na ƒçisto crkvenoslavenskom jeziku¬´\\" In 1938 Re≈°etar, who was a Serb Catholic from Dubrovnik, published a prologue of the phototypic edition of Micaloviƒás books.

While serving, he played drums in the Coast Artillery band, where he met tenor saxophonist Dave van Kriedt, who introduced him to Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond. After demobilization in 1946, Dodge worked in several dixieland groups and dance bands around the Bay area. In 1950, Dodge became tired of road touring and economic instability and was able to get a job working in a bank. Nonetheless, he still kept in touch with Desmond, who arranged for him to play an engagement in an octet led by Brubeck as a temporary replacement for drummer Cal Tjader. By then, the Brubeck octet was playing at the San Francisco Opera House, where they opened the show for Nat King Cole and Woody Herman.Dave Brubeck, The Biography. Part 2: 1920‚Äì1948. Dave Brubeck Jazz. Retrieved on July 7, 2016. A few years later, Desmond again recommended Dodge to Brubeck. As a result, he became the regular drummer of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, participating with the group in different music venues in the United States while recording five successful albums between 1953 and 1956. During the same period, Dodge was featured in two albums with different formats directed by Desmond. Late in 1956, Dodge was worn down by the travel and intense schedule with the quartet and wanted to spend more time with his family. He then told Brubeck it was time to look for another drummer and took a day job in San Francisco. Meanwhile, in the Quartet‚Äôs New York stays, Desmond had heard the Marian McPartland trio at the Hickory House and was impressed with Joe Morello, the drummer who had been working with her since 1953. Desmond then said Brubeck that they should hire Morello, and when Brubeck heard Morello playing, he asked him if he would be interested in joining his group and the drummer did not jump at the opportunity. In 1957, Dodge had a chance to return to the jazz spotlight when bandleader Stan Kenton offered him a job as a transitory replacement for Mel Lewis, but Dodge decided to turn the offer down. From 1958 until he retired in 1981, he combined his activities working in the liquor business with musical engagements in the evenings. Dodge kept in contact with Desmond until the saxophonist's death in 1977 and never lost touch with Brubeck. At one point, Dodge played at Brubeck's fiftieth wedding anniversary in 1992 at the Claremont Hotel in Oakland, where he shared time with many of the pianist's former colleagues. Joe Dodge died in 2004 in Lake Elsinore, California, at the age of 82.

The 1930s depression led to the end of government subsidised airmail contracts and only one prototype flew. It was lost in 1933 during preparations for a private, long distance flight. Design The Reid Aircraft co. was established in February 1928 by W.T. Reid in Montreal but purchased by the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company in December 1928. The renamed Curtiss- Reid Aircraft Company remained in Montreal. In early 1931 all government airmail contracts were threatened with cancellation because of the worsening economic conditions but J.A.D. McCurdy, the head of Curtiss-Reid hoped that a specialised mailplane, economical and able to fly in Canada's harsh winters, might find approval. The Courier (Courrier in French) was a parasol wing aircraft. Its wing was in three parts: two outer panels, straight-edged in plan with constant chord and square tips, swept at 4¬∞ and with about 4¬∞ of dihedral, and a small trapezoidal centre-section of shorter chord. This latter was a metal structure which also served as a fuel tank. The outer panels were each built around two wooden spars and duralumin ribs. Like the rest of the Courier, the wings were fabric covered. Its Frise type ailerons were balanced both statically and aerodynamically. The wing was braced to the lower fuselage on each side with V-struts to the spars and the central-section joined to the upper fuselage on steel cabane struts. The outer panels folded back along the fuselage for storage or transport on outward leaning rear hinges which placed the trailing edge of the folded wing above that of the centre-section. Short, telescopic struts supported the wings during the folding process. The Courier was powered by a de Havilland Gipsy III, a four-cylinder air-cooled inverted inline engine, driving a two-bladed propeller. Its oil-cooler was placed under the engine where, in winter, engine heat could keep the oil fluid. The Courier's fuselage was roughly quadrilateral in section and built on welded steel tube Warren girder frames, though the upper decking was rounded. Mail was contained within a compartment immediately behind the engine with a weight limit of . An open but heated cockpit was placed aft of the trailing edge, the pilot's upward vision enhanced by the short chord centre-section. At the rear, tailplane and elevators, nearly rectangular in plan, were mounted on top of the fuselage. The Courier could be trimmed by adjusting the angle of incidence of the tailplane. The fin and rudder were tall and rounded; the latter extended down to the keel and worked in a cut-out between the elevators. The Courier had split-axle, tailskid landing gear with its bent axles articulated from a small pyramid of steel tubes from the fuselage underside centre-line and with drag struts back to the centre-line. Another, longitudinal, tube from the drag struts' meeting point braced the pyramid. Long-travel oleo struts to the upper fuselage, medium pressure tyres and a track of assisted landings on rough ground. The wheels were enclosed in fairings and equipped with brakes. Its tailskid, which protruded from the extreme fuselage tail, also had an oleo shock absorber. The Courier could also be flown as a floatplane after replacing the main gear with a pair of Edo single-stepped floats. Operational history The Courier was flown for the first time in mid- January 1932 from Cartierville by Pete Vachon. An attempt to interest Canadian Airways, the biggest airmail carrier, failed and Curtiss-Reid had to abandon hopes of production. Efforts to interest the Royal Canadian Air Force also failed, though the sole prototype was flown to Ottawa where official air force performance tests were conducted. For unknown reasons, their speeds were about 10% slower than the manufacturer's. Though the Courier handled well, as demonstrated on a long flight to Charlottetown on Prince Edward Island as part of the Maritime Air Tour, the depressed economy made it hard to sell to clubs or individuals. In February 1933 it was sold to a private owner for a long distance flight. Fairchild fitted it with extra tanks for fuel and oil, increasing fuel capacity by factor of 5.5 and loaded weight by 52%. Fairchild's chief pilot, Bernard Martin had been hired to test fly the modified Courier but on his second flight on 17 June 1933 it spun in on landing approach, killing Martin and destroying the aircraft.

Early life and family  =New Orleans and Dallas= Oswald was born Marguerite Frances Claverie in 1907 to John Claverie, whose family were French Catholics, and Dora Stucke, a German Lutheran, a family of French and German descent. In 1911 Her mother died, leaving Oswald, her three sisters, and brothers Charles and John in the care of their streetcar conductor father, who raised them on a salary of $90 a month, though he had the help of housekeepers.Bugliosi, Vincent (May 17, 2007).

President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy (1964). National Archives and Records Administration (Washington, D.C.). Retrieved May 7, 2019. Oswald's brothers, Charles and John, both died of tuberculosis as young men. Oswald attended McDonogh High school, but dropped out in her first year. Shortly before she turned 17, she began working at a New Orleans law firm as a receptionist, falsely claiming on her application that she had graduated high school. In August 1929, while she was still working at the law firm, Oswald married Edward John Pic, Jr., a clerk for a stevedoring company. By July 1931, when Oswald was three months pregnant, they had separated, because, according to Pic, of irreconcilable differences, though a salient issue was money, as it would be for Oswald her entire life. Oswald told her family that Pic did not want children, and would not support her. Their son, John Edward Pic, was born on January 17, 1932. Pic supported him until he was 18, though he only saw him occasionally in his first year, and then not again until he was 16. During their separation, Oswald met a friend of Lillian's, a premium collector for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company named Robert Edward Lee Oswald, who was also separated from his wife, when he saw her and infant John coming home from a park. Oswald divorced her husband in 1933, by which time Oswald had as well. Six months after Robert Edward's divorce, he married Oswald in a Lutheran church on July 20. Oswald described her marriage to Robert Edward as \\"the only happy part\\" of her life. Their first son, Robert Jr., was born April 7, 1934, and though Robert Sr. wanted to adopt John, Oswald refused this in order to maintain Edward's support payments. On August 19, 1939, little more than a year after the Oswalds bought a house on Alvar Street, Robert Lee Oswald died of a heart attack while mowing a lawn on a hot day. On October 18, 1939, the Oswalds' second son, Lee Harvey Oswald, was born at New Orleans' Old French Hospital. In 1944, Oswald moved her family from New Orleans to Dallas, Texas. She later married Edwin A. Ekdahl that year. They separated in 1946, and formally divorced in 1948. After her second divorce, she became known as Marguerite C. Oswald. =Move to New York City= In August 1952, Oswald and Lee moved to New York City, where they lived for a short time with her son John Pic, a Coast Guard staff sergeant who worked at the Port Security Unit at Ellis Island, and who lived with his 18-year-old wife Marge and their three- month-old sonBugliosi (2007), pp. 527 - 529. in an apartment at 325 East 92nd Street. Though John and Marge initially bonded with twelve-year-old Lee, Oswald and Lee's stay there, which the young couple understood to be a visit, was turbulent. This was owing to Oswald's conflict with Marge, and her stated desire to move in with them permanently, one which the couple rejected. During the Oswalds' stay, Lee enrolled in the seventh grade at Trinity Evangelical Lutheran School on Watson Avenue. On September 30, after several weeks of inconsistent attendance, Lee enrolled in P.S. 117, a junior high school in the Bronx, where he was teased by classmates for his regional clothes and accent,\\"Chapter 7: Lee Harvey Oswald: Background and Possible Motives\\". Warren Commission Report (1964). Around this same time, John noticed that Lee's disposition at home changed. No longer well-behaved, he was hostile to him and their mother, and disrespectful of authority. A few days after an incident in which Marge related that Lee threatened her with a pocket knife, the Oswalds moved out of the Pics' apartment, Lee's rapport with the Pics now permanently broken. Oswald found a one-room basement apartment at 1455 Sheridan Avenue, and found a job at Lerner Shops. However, Lee became truant, preferring to stay home to read and watch television over attending school. Because neither his mother nor school authorities were able to compel his return to school, truancy charges were brought against him, stating that he was \\"beyond the control of his mother insofar as school attendance is concerned.\\" Lee was sent to Youth House, an institution where children underwent psychiatric observation, where he stayed from April 16 to May 7, 1953. Lee was found to exhibit higher-than-normal intelligence for his age, and showed no signs of neurological impairment or psychotic impairment, having scored 118 on an IQ test. However, Chief Psychiatrist, Dr. Renatus Hartogs found: > Lee has to be diagnosed as 'personality pattern disturbance with schizoid > features and passive--aggressive tendencies.' Lee has to be seen as an > emotionally, quite disturbed youngster who suffers under the impact of > really existing emotional isolation and deprivation, lack of affection, > absence of family life and rejection by a self involved and conflicted > mother. Hartogs recommended that Lee be placed on probation on condition that he seek help and guidance through a child guidance clinic, and that Oswald seek \\"psychotherapeutic guidance through contact with a family agency.\\" Evelyn D Siegel, a social worker who interviewed both Lee and Oswald at Youth House, while describing \\"a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved, affectionless youngster which grows as one speaks to him,\\" found that he had detached himself from the world around him because \\"no one in it ever met any of his needs for love.\\" Hartogs and Sigel indicated that Oswald gave Lee very little affection, with Siegel concluding that Lee \\"just felt that his mother never gave a damn for him. He always felt like a burden that she simply just had to tolerate.\\" Furthermore, Oswald did not apparently indicate an awareness of the relationship between her conduct and Lee's psychological problems, with Siegel describing Oswald as a \\"defensive, rigid, self-involved person who had real difficulty in accepting and relating to people\\" and who had \\"little understanding\\" of Lee's behavior and of the \\"protective shell he has drawn around himself.\\" Hartogs reported that Oswald did not understand that Lee's withdrawal was a form of \\"violent but silent protest against his neglect by her and represents his reaction to a complete absence of any real family life.\\" When Lee returned to school for the 1953 Fall semester, his disciplinary problems continued, and when Oswald failed to cooperate with school authorities, they came consider placing him in a home for boys. This was postponed, perhaps partially because his behavior abruptly improved.Warren Commission Hearings, Testimony of John Carro. Before the New York family court system could address their case,Warren Commission Hearings, Testimony of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald. the Oswalds left New York in January 1954, and returned to New Orleans, where Lee finished the ninth grade before he left school to work for a year. In October 1956, he joined the Marines. Oswald's disagreeable nature made it nearly impossible for her to maintain a job. She held a variety of positions, including as a legal clerk and telephone operator. One family that had hired her as a baby nurse fired her when they began to suspect she was drugging their infant so he would stop crying at night.  Kennedy assassination  On the day of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Oswald phoned the offices of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and asked for a ride to Dallas. She was granted this peculiar request after revealing her identity, and the reporter to chauffeur her was Bob Schieffer. Oswald referred to her son's murder by Jack Ruby as \\"the tragic event.\\" She also stated to a television camera \\"my son, even after his death, has done more for his country than any other living human being.\\" After the assassination, Secret Service agent Jerry Parr was assigned to protect Oswald until the completion of her February 1964 testimony before the Warren Commission. In 1979, the United States House of Representatives Assassinations Committee concluded that President Kennedy‚Äôs murder was probably the result of a conspiracy, one possibly involving organized crime, and that Oswald may have had \\"personal relationships\\" with members of the Mafia in her younger days.  Later life  After the assassination and subsequent murder of her son, Oswald maintained her son's innocence and that he was instead an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency. She created a shrine in her home to honor his life and military service, and frequently promoted conspiracy theories regarding the assassination. She wrote a booklet titled Aftermath of an Execution: The Burial and Final Rites of Lee Harvey Oswald, which was never published. During her later years, she was willing to grant media interviews for compensation. Oswald also charged for her signature and would sell expired licenses and library cards for two hundred dollars each. Sometimes she could be found on Dealey Plaza, selling autographed business cards to tourists for five dollars that stated, \\"Marguerite Oswald, mother of Lee Harvey Oswald.\\" She died in 1981 and is buried beside her son Lee at the Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Burial Park in Fort Worth, Texas.  In popular culture  Oswald was the subject of a 1966 book by Jean Stafford titled A Mother in History, a profile of Marguerite Oswald. Oswald was portrayed in the 1966 London stage adaptation of The Silence of Lee Harvey Oswald by actress Bessie Love. Oswald was portrayed by Annabelle Weenick in the 1977 television film The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald. In 1991, Oswald was portrayed by actress Ada Lynn in the Oliver Stone film JFK. In 1997, Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh released the film Willem Oltmans, De Eenmotorige Mug (Willem Oltmans, the single-engined mosquito). In the film, journalist Willem Oltmans makes claims about his contacts with George de Mohrenschildt and Oswald. Oswald was portrayed by Mary Pat Gleason in the 2013 film Killing Kennedy, by Jacki Weaver in the film Parkland that same year, and by actress Cherry Jones in the 2016 Hulu television thriller miniseries 11.22.63.

During her time at Langley Speedway, she waited tables for three nights each week. She interviewed drivers for Langley Speedway TV which were telecast on local television station WSKY and on Cox on Demand. After the conclusion of her first racing season, Vincie became concerned over her future and chose to upload self-made NASCAR reports onto YouTube. She uploaded a video blog series aimed towards racing fans called Hot for NASCAR where she interviewed drivers and gave her opinions on the Sprint Cup Series. Vincie was assisted by producers from Langley Speedway who provided her with a chroma key and installed video equipment. She also studied computer software to allow her to edit her videos. The blogs achieved a large amount of success, that it caused stock car racing website SceneDaily to broadcast them on their site every week. Following her new popularity, Langley Speedway's management elected to keep her for the next racing season, after which she left.

Her research uses global climate models and also large-scale observational databases. Raphael has been teaching at UCLA since 1998 and spent time as departmental chair (2010-2013). Notable courses include: Climatology, Environmental Impact Analysis, Seminar - Environmental Studies, Tropical Climatology, and Issues in Geographical Inquiry.  Influences  Growing up, education was of the utmost importance for Raphael. Her mother was one of the key driving factors for pushing an education because she saw that education was the key to advancing in life. Raphael's path to climatology specifically was internally driven; however, she had people in her life that served as role models and mentors. Her high school teacher as well as her undergraduate adviser were both very encouraging of her pursuits into the geosciences. Raphael's interest in the Southern Hemisphere specifically came about when she was pursuing her PhD in Geography.  Positions and accomplishments  Marilyn N. Raphael is a professor in the Department of Geography at UCLA and is a former chair of the department, serving between 2010 and 2013. Raphael is a co-chair of the Science Committee of Antarctic Research (SCAR) expert group Antarctic Sea Ice Processes and Climate (ASPeCt). She is also a co-lead of the World Climate Research Programme's Polar Climate Predictability Initiative. Raphael has also served on the National Research Council‚Äôs Committees on Future Science Opportunities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean and Stabilization Targets for Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Concentrations. Raphael's co-authored book, The Encyclopedia of Weather and Climate Change: A Complete Visual Guide, received an Atmospheric Science Librarians International (ASLI) Choice Award in 2010.

He has held senior management positions in some of Germany‚Äôs most prominent companies such as Volkswagen and EnBW.  Education  In 1980 Claassen earned his high school diploma (Abitur) after skipping two grades with a grade point average of 0.7 (close to the highest value possible on the German scale). As this was the best diploma score a high school student had hitherto achieved in Germany, he was invited to the German ARD (broadcaster) TV show \\"Auf Los geh's los\\". Claassen studied economics at Leibniz University Hannover and at Oxford University. From 1986 to 1987, he served as the President of all post-graduate students at Magdalen College and of the entire University of Oxford. In 1985 and 1989, respectively, he obtained his master's degree (Diplom) and his Doctorate at the University of Hannover with distinguished grades each.  Career  = Early years = Utz Claassen began his career in 1987 as a consultant at McKinsey & Company. In 1989 he moved to Ford Europe, where he was responsible for the management control system and worked in a team implementing measures for simultaneous engineering. Thereafter, Volkswagen appointed him to oversee their management control system. From 1992 to 1994 he rose through the ranks of the car-manufacturer and eventually became an executive director. = Senior positions =  CFO at SEAT  A few days after his 31st birthday, Claassen was then appointed chief financial officer of SEAT, a subsidiary of Volkswagen. Whereas the automaker had accumulated a significant deficit in 1993, the company became profitable again within three years under Claassen's leadership.  CEO at Sartorius  From 1997 until 2003 he served as Chairman of the Executive Board and Group CEO of Sartorius AG, which manufactures pharmaceutical and laboratory equipment. During his time at Sartorius, Claassen oversaw several acquisitions along with a significant increase in revenues.  CEO at EnBW  In 2003 he was appointed CEO/Chairman of the Board of Management of EnBW Energie Baden-W√ºrttemberg AG, the third largest utility company in Germany. While in office, he managed to turn annual losses of over 1 billion euros in 2003 into a record profit for three years in a row, before he left the energy supplier in 2007. Acknowledging his efforts to assume social and economic responsibility alongside the corporation's foreign engagement, Russia awarded him with the Order of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker in 2005 and France with the knight- class order of the L√©gion d'Honneur in 2006.  Board member at AWD  From 2008 to 2013 he served as a member of the Supervisory Board of AWD Holding AG, one of Germany's largest financial service providers.  Founder and chairman of the board of directors at Syntellix  In 2008 he set up the medical technology startup Syntellix, which develops and manufactures a biodegradable implant to cure fractures. For this product Syntellix has won a number of innovation prizes such as the Top 100 innovation award of 2017. In addition, Claassen himself received the award as \\"Most Innovative Entrepreneur International 2016\\" from the hands of EU Commissioner G√ºnther Oettinger. While Claassen remains chairman of the board of directors, the company claims to have sold 27.000 \\"Magnesix\\" implants worldwide as of March 2017.  CEO at Solar Millennium  In early 2010 he briefly entered the renewable energy corporation Solar Millennium AG as its CEO. After three months, he used his contractually granted right to resign immediately within a predefined period of consideration. He justified this step by explaining that he had been given misleading information by Solar Millennium prior to accepting the position as CEO. In April 2013, a legal dispute that had evolved around the resignation ended with the legally binding conclusion that Classen's resignation was lawful, valid and justified.  President of RCD Mallorca  From December 2014 until June 2016, Claassen worked as President of RCD Mallorca. During his tenure he focussed on restructuring the soccer club through a strategic reorientation. In January 2016 he handed the club over to the ACQ Lagacy Partners LLC by transferring 80 percent of its shares within the context of a capital increase by more than 20 million euros. This was also the first engagement by NBA franchise owners in European soccer.  Academic life  Since 2001 Claassen has worked as a professor at the University of G√∂ttingen and Leibniz University Hannover, where he holds lectures on management control systems and serves as an academic ambassador. Starting in 2009 he also gave management courses at GISMA Business School. Besides, Claassen has released numerous scientific publications covering topics such as leadership, knowledge as well as risk management and entrepreneurial innovation.

It spans from Old Sacramento, through Downtown Sacramento and Midtown Sacramento, ending in East Sacramento. Other discontinuous segments of K Street in East Sacramento are small residential streets, with the final segment ultimately ending at 54th Street. K Street is known primarily as a shopping, dining and entertainment destination for Downtown, Midtown, and Old Sac. History The path of the street roughly (but not exactly) follows the line from Old Sacramento to Sutter's Fort, which existed as a trail before Sacramento was founded.Sacramento's K Street: Where Our City was Born, William Burg K Street was once a continuous street for automobile traffic in the mid-20th century during its heyday as a major shopping destination. Department and other large stores that once lined K Street included Breuner's, Weinstock's, Hale's, S. H. Kress & Co., Roos/Atkins, Montgomery Ward and Sears. Movie theaters included the Crest, the Senator, the Hippodrome and, nearby, the Alhambra. In 1969, K Street in downtown Sacramento was closed to all automobile traffic permanently, as it was converted into a pedestrian mall that evolved into the modern K Street Mall. In 1987, Sacramento Regional Transit opened their light rail system, with tracks running on K Street between 7th and 12th Streets. On November 12, 2011, K Street between 8th and 12th Streets was opened to automobile traffic for the first time in 42 years. In November 2012, the K Street Mall was rebranded \\"The Kay\\", and now functions as a shopping area.http://fox40.com/2012/10/10/k-street-becomes-the-kay/ In May 2014, the Sacramento city council approved a public subsidy deal to build a downtown arena. The re-use of the failing Downtown Plaza shopping mall was seen as a possible catalyst to bring revenue and people to Downtown. Today, much of K Street is undergoing re-development, with many businesses still active. Landmarks along K Street include:K Street Mall website * Downtown Commons including a Macy's department store and the Golden 1 Center, home of the NBA's Sacramento Kings.

Crimes involving foreigners (German: Ausl√§nderkriminalit√§t) have been a longstanding theme in public debates in Germany. In November 2015, a report that was released by the Federal Criminal Police (BKA) stated that \\"While the number of refugees is rising very dynamically, the development of crime does not increase to the same extent.\\" Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi√®re (CDU) noted that \\"refugees are on average as little or often delinquent as comparison groups of the local population.\\" A 2018 statistical study by researchers at the University of Magdeburg using 2009-2015 data argued that, where analysis is restricted to crimes involving at least one German victim and one refugee suspect and crimes by immigrants against other immigrants are excluded, there is no relationship between the scale of refugee inflow and the crime rate. In 2018 the interior ministry under Horst Seehofer (CSU) published, for the first time, an analysis of the Federal Police Statistic (German: '), which includes all those who came via the asylum system to Germany. The report found that the immigrant group, which makes up about 2% of the overall population, contains 8.5% of all suspects, after violations against Germany's alien law are excluded. Availability and reliability of statistics Several studies carried out since the 1990s have suggested that the collection of accurate and meaningful statistics makes it difficult to obtain an overall picture of the effect of immigration on crime in Germany. For example, second or third generation immigrants may be classified as \\"foreigners\\" whilst recent immigrants may be classified as German. Research also suggests that crimes are more likely to be reported, if the suspect is or appears to be a foreigner or immigrant. Because each of Germany‚Äôs 16 states has its own police force, federal authorities do not routinely publish national statistics. These are compiled state by state and are sometimes released only after a parliamentary request. \\"Guest worker\\" era in the 1950s-1980s The (Foreigners Act) of 1965 attempted to control immigration to West Germany. During the 1950s and 1960s, a group known as Gastarbeiter participated in an organised immigration programme to the former West Germany because of labour shortages in the country. The former East Germany also had labour shortages but their \\"guest worker\\" programme tended to encourage immigration from other socialist and communist countries. Although the German government did not plan the program as a permanent method of keeping the \\"guest workers\\", after unification and the reform of German Naturalization Laws of the 1990s, former \\"guest workers\\" increasingly became German citizens. The first generation of \\"guest workers\\" did not have an elevated crime rate, but studies carried out in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that second- and third-generation immigrants had higher crime rates than their German contemporaries who were not from an immigrant background. A 1991 Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich study covering the preceding two decades found that crime rates were higher among immigrants with a strongly different cultural background from Germans. Under the guest worker programme, Turks and Yugoslavs had far higher crime rates than Spaniards and Portuguese, while the highest crime rates were recorded among individuals from third world countries. For third world countries, the immigrants were first generation. Trends in criminal activity since the 1990s Studies in the early 2000s tended to show little correlation between migrants and crime in Germany. From the start of 2015 to the end of 2017, asylum seekers were registered in total. According to a 2018 study by German criminologists, the crime rate of non-Germans between the ages of 16 and 30 is within the same range as that of Germans. In May 2016, U.S. fact-checker Politifact suggested that, as crimes by immigrants rose 79 percent in 2015 and the number of refugees in the country rose by 440 percent, the crime rate among refugees was lower than that among German natives. In November 2015, a report by the Federal Criminal Police (BKA) stated that \\"While the number of refugees is rising very dynamically, the development of crime does not increase to the same extent.\\" the report noted that refugees Kosovo, aus Serbien and Macedonia were overrepresented and Iraqis were underrepresented. The report did not contain representation for refugees from North Africa. From 2015 to 2016, the number of suspected crimes by refugees, asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants increased by 52.7% percent to 175,438. Approved refugees were not included in 2016 statistical figures. The figures showed that most of the suspected crimes were by repeat offenders, and that 1 percent of migrants accounted for 40 percent of total migrant crimes. According to police statistics, 31% of immigrant crime suspects were repeat offenders. From 2016 to 2017, the number of crimes committed by refugees, asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants in Germany decreased by 40 percent, which was mostly caused by significantly fewer violations off the alien law, because far fewer asylum seekers entered the country in this year. The first comprehensive study of the social effects of the one million refugees going to Germany found that it caused \\"very small increases in crime in particular with respect to drug offenses and fare- dodging.\\" A report released by the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation in November 2015 found that over the period January‚ÄìSeptember 2015, the crime rate of refugees was the same as that of native Germans. According to Deutsche Welle, the report \\"concluded that the majority of crimes committed by refugees (67 percent) consisted of theft, robbery and fraud. Sex crimes made for less than 1 percent of all crimes committed by refugees, while homicide registered the smallest fraction at 0.1 percent.\\" According to the conservative newspaper Die Welts description of the report, the most common crime committed by refugees was not paying fares on public transportation.13.11.15 Straftaten \\"im sehr niedrigen sechsstelligen Bereich\\", Die Welt, https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article148812603/Straftaten- im-sehr-niedrigen-sechsstelligen-Bereich.html According to Deutsche Welle's reporting in February 2016 of a report by the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation, the number of crimes committed by refugees did not rise in proportion to the number of refugees between 2014‚Äì2015. According to Deutsche Welle, \\"between 2014 and 2015, the number of crimes committed by refugees increased by 79 percent. Over the same period, the number of refugees in Germany increased by 440 percent.\\" A 2015 study in the European Economic Review found that the immigration of more than 3 million people of German descent to Germany after the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a significant increase in crime. The effects were strongest in regions with high unemployment, high preexisting crime levels or large shares of foreigners. The refugee crisis in Germany has increased to above ‚Äú1.7 million‚Äù (Trines, 2019) refugees dating back to 2014. In the year 2014 alone, ‚Äú‚Ä¶there were 6.1 million offenses recorded by the police‚Äù (Reality Check Team BBC News, 2018). The hate crimes committed by German residents alone has become such an issue in the state that there have been studies conducted to find factors that affect the number of these crimes against refugees. Out of the 3,335 attacks on refugees between 2016 and 2017, Karsten Mueller and Carlo Schwarz, researchers at the University of Warwick, noticed a trend with regard to the attacks (Taub & Fisher, 2018). ‚ÄúTowns where Facebook use was higher than average, like Altena, reliably experienced more attacks on refugees. That held true in virtually any sort of community ‚Äî big city or small town; affluent or struggling; liberal haven or far-right stronghold ‚Äî suggesting that the link applies universally‚Äù (Taub & Fisher, 2018). This information can give German officials an inkling as to where these attacks will occur. Towns like Altena may be a small sample size, but the researchers also found more information regarding attacks in Germany: ‚ÄúWherever per-person Facebook use rose to one standard deviation above the national average, attacks on refugees increased by about 50 percent. (Taub & Fisher, 2018). These findings allude to the fact that Germans may be just as much at fault for the spike in crime rates since 2014 as the refugees are. Another study done by Yue Huang regarding migrant criminal action on Germans since 2015 and whether or not there was a correlation between the number of immigrants and crimes against Germans (Lindsay, 2019). ‚ÄúThe answer to this research question, according to Huang, was fairly clear. ‚ÄòWe did not find a systematic association between the number of refugees and the number of German victims, in crimes that were committed by refugees‚Äô‚Äù (Lindsay, 2019). The finding in this study shows that the spikes in crime are not fully attributed to refugees alone. For several types of crime and drug crime in particular, it was reported that organised crime gangs were dominated by people from countries with high rates of immigration to Germany. In 2017, the most common nationality of foreign organized crime gangs was Albanian with 21 gangs, the great majority of which were active in drug trafficking. In 2017 there were 13 identified Serbian organized crime gangs, active in drug crime, property crime and violent crime. In 2017 there were 12 Kosovar gangs, active in property crime, drug trade and forgeries. Syrian gangs were active in drug trade and drug smuggling. The Independent reported that in 2017 crime in Germany was at its lowest for 30 years, and that crimes by non-Germans had fallen by 23% to just over 700,000. At the same time, there was a significant increase in politically and racially motivated crime. Out of 462 right-wing offenders with outstanding warrants identified by Germany's Interior Ministry, 104 were wanted for crimes classified as violent and 106 were wanted for crimes classified as politically motivated. In 2018, the Wall Street Journal analysed German crime statistics for crime suspects and found that the foreigners, overall 12.8% of the population, made up a disproportionate share of crime suspects (34.7%), see horizontal bar chart. In 2018, the interior ministry's report \\"Criminality in the context of immigration\\" (German: Kriminalit√§t im Kontext von Zuwanderung) for the first time summarized and singled out all people who entered Germany via the asylum system. The group called \\"immigrants\\" includes all asylum seekers, tolerated people, \\"unauthorized residents\\" and all those entitled to protection (subsidiary protected, contingent refugees and refugees under the Geneva Convention and asylum). The group represented roughly 2 percent of the German population by the end of 2017, and was suspected of committing 8.5 percent of crimes (violations of Germany's alien law are not included). The numbers suggest that the differences could at least to some extent have to do with the fact that the refugees are younger and more often male than the average German. The statistics show that the asylum-group is highly overrepresented for some types of crime. They account for 14.3 percent of all suspects in crimes against life (which include murder, manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter), 12.2 percent of sexual offences, 11.4 percent of thefts and 9.7 percent of body injuries The report also shows differences between the origin of migrants. Syrians are underrepresented as suspects, whereas citizens from most African countries, especially northern Africans are strongly overerrepresented. Afghans and Pakistanis are particularly overerrepresented in sexual offenses. The 2019 \\"Criminality in the context of immigration\\" report showed an increase of 102% in the number of Germans who were victims of a crime committed by a member of the immigrants group (including all those who came via the asylum system to Germany) than vice versa. In the category \\"crimes against life\\" there were 230 cases where the victim is a German and a suspect belongs to the immigrant group; the number the 81 German victims of a terrorist attack, the 2016 Berlin truck attack which were all counted as homicide or attempted homicide victims. The number of immigrants attacked by Germans in 2018 was recorded as 33. In the category \\"sexual offences\\", 3261 Germans were victims of crimes with an immigrant among the suspects, whilst 89 immigrants were victims of crimes with a German among the suspects.. The first quarter 2019 BKA report stated that no other group is as strongly overrepresented as crime suspects in Germany as asylum seekers, refugees and individuals without residency who cannot be deported (German: Geduldete). This group numbers about 1.6 million people and the great majority arrived in 2015 and later. They represent 2% of the population in Germany but 11% of suspects in cases of grievous bodily harm, 15% of suspects in cases of deadly violence and 12% of suspects in cases of rape and sexual assault. This was attributed by criminologists to the subgroup consisting of men aged 16-29 is disproportionately large at 34% of the total and that young males are overrepresented as criminals in all parts of the world, rather than to their ethnic origin. Also, the young male immigrants also have high unemployment, low education and experiences of violence, factors which are associated with higher crime rates also among Germans. Therefore left-leaning criminologists like Professor Thomas Feltes at Bochum University argue that culture does not play a role. The BKA report shows that in the group, there are significant different among subgroups of different origin, where refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria are less overrepresented than migrants from North African states Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia along with sub-Saharan countries Gambia, Nigeria and Somalia. Criminologist Christian Pfeiffer attributes this to a \\"macho culture\\" in North Africa which carries with it an increased readiness to use violence. Academic Christian Walburg at Universit√§t M√ºnster attributes this to the North Africans having nearly no possibility of being given asylum and therefore have \\"less to lose\\". = Organised crime = Arab and Kurdish organized crime gangs have their roots in asylum seekers who began arriving in the 1980s. In the 1980s thousands of Arabs and Kurds from districts of Lebanon and Turkey, significant portions of whome were stateless, sought asylum in Germany. Unlike the earlier guest workers, were allowed to work but instead received social benefits and often did not integrate into German society. Some of the arrived families instead relied on tribal and Islamic codes of justice. Groups of extended Arab and Kurdish families centered in Berlin are active in selling illegal drugs and running illegal prostitution, but have invested in legal businesses including real estate, fitness studios, gambling and restaurants. They exploit asylum seekers who arrived in the European migrant crisis of 2015-2016, employing them as streetcorner drug dealers. In 2017, 16 Nigerian crime gangs were active in illegal immigration (German: Schleuserkriminalit√§t) drug crime and other offenses in the night life scene. In an opinion piece in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung in September 2018, the political scientist argued that federal authorities had refused to recognise the specific problem of organized crime gangs based on family ties and ethnicity (), subsuming it under \\"organised crime\\" and that, encouraged by the success of the Arab clans, families from other ethnic groups, including Chechens, Albanians, and Kosovars were developing similar structures. According to Ghadban, these structures present a threat to liberal, individualised societies because they hinder integration. A modern society, he says, only functions when people voluntarily follow its rules, but clan members consider themselves members of a family rather than citizens of a country, and do not submit to the rule of law, regarding individuals who do so as weak and unprotected. According to the Wall Street Journal, the ethnic crime clans represent both a security threat as well as an example of what can happen when integration of immigrants fails. = Honor killings = Investigating criminal records for partner homicides from the years 1996-2005 period, the BKA concluded that there were about 12 cases of honour killings in Germany per year, including cases involving collective family honor and individual male honour, out of an average about 700 annual homicides. An accompanied study of all homicides in Baden-W√ºrttemberg show that men from Turkey, Yugoslavia and Albania have a between three and fime times overrepresentation for partner homicides, both honor and non-honour releated. The causes for the higher rate were given as low education and social status of these groups along with cultural traditions of violence against women. 43% of the killings described in the study were against men. As of 2018, there are no current official statistics on honour killings in Germany. = Sexual offences = Germany's Interior Minister, Thomas de Maizi√®re, said that a 2015 report by the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) showed that \\"there is a higher absolute number of criminal cases only because of the increase in number of people living here with the arrival of the refugees\\". The report said that sex crimes constituted less than 1 percent of all crimes committed by refugees. A 2016 report from the BKA showed that at least one asylum seeker was identified as a suspect in 3404 sexual offence cases reported in 2016, representing a proportion of 9.1% of the total; this was twice the proportion in the previous year. According to statistics collected by BKA, the number of asylum seekers suspected of sexual offences in Germany went up in absolute numbers in the 2012-2016 period, whereas the number of German perpetrators remained the same or fell. In 2017, asylum seekers represented 2% of the population and 15.9% of suspects in rape and sexual assault cases. In that year, the proportion of asylum seekers (defined as \\"asylum applicants, quota or civil war refugees or irregular immigrants\\") relative to the total population had risen, while the number of asylum seekers as a percentage of sexual offence suspects had fallen slightly since 2016. German crime statistics for 2019 suggest a rise in sexual offences  Gang rape  After the gang rapes where immigrants were suspect in Freiburg, Munich and Velbert, an overview of police gang rape statistics in the 2010s was published by Tagesschau in 2018. The profile of the suspects and convicted fit that of sex crime in general as they were almost all male. Additionally foreign perpetrators were overrepresented compared to their share of the overall population in Germany. The absolute number of gang rapes were not increasing, but the proportion of foreign suspects rose and the proportion of Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi suspects rose. One reason cited for the increase was that these demographics have larger proportions of young males, which are inherently overrepresented for crime. The number of assault gang rapes were significantly higher in periods prior to 2015 and the European migrant crisis, with the exception of 2016 where the New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany nearly doubled the number of cases. In 2017 there were 122 cases, the fewest since the German reunification in 1990. The sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2016 nevertheless ended the atmosphere of euphoria earlier in the year when hundreds of thousands of migrants had arrived in Germany. = Violent crime = In 2016, immigrant suspects constituted 14.9% of the suspects while representing 2% of the population. Blade weapon crimes According to the police union, the German government does not keep a record of knife and blade related crimes as a distinct type of crime. The German Police Trade Union (DPoIG) has highlighted the issue and has sought that individuals carrying a knife be prosecuted under attempted murder provisions in German law. The union urged the government to compile statistics nationwide on knife incidents, to establish whether the impression of an increase in knife crime and the involvement of younger immigrants was based on fact. A series of prominent incidents led to a political discussion. Such incidents included some where an attacker murdered their partner (the 2017 Kandel stabbing attack, the Reutlingen knife attack, the murder of Mireille B, the 2018 Hamburg stabbing attack), as well as incidents like the 2018 Burgwedel stabbing where a 17-year-old Syrian stabbed and injured a woman following a brawl between two youths in a supermarket, the 2018 Flensburg stabbing incident where a 24-year-old Eritrean refugee was shot and killed after stabbing a police woman with a kitchen knife, and the 2017 Siegaue rape case where a 31-year-old Ghanaian used a machete in an attack where a victim was raped.String of knife attacks further fuels debate over refugees and violence, The Local, 27 March 2018Vergewaltigte Camperin bei Bonn: Angeklagter zu elfeinhalb Jahren Haft verurteilt, Spiegel online, 19. Oktober 2017. = Statistics = In German Federal Police Office (BKA) statistics on immigrant crime, \\"immigrant\\" include: * Asylum seekers * Migrants who are temporarily allowed to stay despite not having received refugee status * Illegal immigrants * Quota refugees Suspects with approved asylum applications are not included. According to the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees people with an immigrant background (German: Migrationshintergrund) are those born without German citizenship, or born with at least one parent without citizenship.  Violence against women  Women with a migration background (German: Migrationshintergrund) are, according to some studies, more often and more seriously affected by domestic violence from partners and have more difficulty extricating themselves from an abusive relationship. = Female Genital Mutilation = FGM has been criminal in Germany since June 2013. According to women's right organisation Terre des Femmes in 2014, there were 25,000 victims living in Germany and a further 2,500 are at risk of being mutilated. Perpetrators are migrant parents who take their children abroad, mostly during holidays, for the mutilation or bring foreign practitioners to Germany to mutilate several girls at once. In 2018, the estimate had increased to . A further were at risk of having the mutilation done to them which represented an increase of 17% on the previous year. According to the BMFSFJ most of the victims originated in Eritrea, Indonesia, Somalia, Egypt and Ethiopia. According to the BMFSFJ, of the 5969 women from Ethiopia living in Germany in May 2016 without German citizenship, 4417 (74%) were victims of female genital mutilation, of the 10462 women from Eritreans living in Germany in May 2016 without German citizenship, 8683 (83%) were victims of female genital mutilation, and of the 5797 women from Somalia living in Germany in May 2016 without German citizenship, 5681 (98%) were victims of female genital mutilation. Crimes against immigrants since the 1990s The long history of Turkish immigration to Germany resulted in Turkish immigrant families becoming one of the largest ethnic minorities in Germany, estimated at between 2.5 and 4 million. Around a third of these still hold Turkish citizenship. On 27 October 1991, Mete Ek≈üi (de), a 19-year-old student from Kreuzberg, was attacked by three neo-Nazi German brothers. Ek≈üi's funeral in November 1991 was attended by 5,000 people. Aslƒ± Bayram's father was murdered in 1994 by a neo-Nazi and Bayram herself was wounded in the attack. In 1993, an arson attack against a Turkish household in the town of Solingen in North Rhine- Westphalia caused the deaths of five people. Ahead of a commemorative event in 2018, 25 years after the event, Turkey's Foreign Office noted that \\"racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia are on the rise\\" in Germany and a representative of the family who were attacked called for reconciliation. A spokesman for anti-right demonstrators at the commemoration said, \\"When you look at how the mood was back then and how it is turning again now, I believe it's important to rally in the streets and to speak out against it.\\" According to a 2016 study, there were 1,645 instances of anti-refugee violence and social unrest in Germany during the years 2014 and 2015. According to the German Federal Criminal Office, there were 797 attacks against residences of refugees or migrants from January to October 2016. 740 attacks had a right-wing background, which also couldn't be ruled out in 57 further cases. Of these, 320 cases of property damage were recorded, in 180 cases propaganda material was dispersed and in 137 cases violence was used. In addition, 61 incidents of arson as well as 10 violations of the Explosives Law, 4 of them in front of a residence of refugees, were registered. According to Der Tagesspiegel, there were also 11 cases of attempted murder or homicide. In 2015, there had been 1,029 attacks against refugee residences, following 199 in 2014. Germany's interior ministry stated that 560 people, including 43 children, had been injured in such attacks during 2016. A 2017 study found that \\"the strength of right-wing parties in a district considerably boosts the probability of attacks on refugees in that area.\\" A 2018 paper by the Institute of Labor Economics found that xenophobic violence during the 1990s in Germany reduced the integration and well-being of immigrants. Another 2018 report, by the VBRG, a victim support group, showed an 8% increase in the number of violent far-right attacks in eastern Germany during the year, with a total of 1,200 such attacks having taken place in the regions of Berlin, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. A 2019 study linked increases in refugee migration to increases in right-wing hate crimes. =Vigilantism and anti- immigrant protests= Vigilantism against immigrants is considered to have become more widespread after the sexual assaults by migrants in Cologne and other German cities on New Year's Eve 2015. In January 2016 a mob attacked a group of Pakistanis in Cologne, and at Bautzen in February, an arson attack on a hostel for asylum seekers took place In February 2018, in Heilbronn, a 70-year-old man knifed three immigrants while drunk, in a protest \\"about the current refugee policy\\". A perceived increase in attacks on immigrants led to Chancellor Angela Merkel condemning anti-immigrant \\"vigilante\\" groups following the Chemnitz incident. The Halle synagogue shooting was carried out by a lone German gunman, who claimed in headcam footage he posted online, that \\"the holocaust never happened...feminism is the cause of declining birth rates in the West which acts as a scapegoat for mass immigration, and the root of all these problems is the Jew.\\" Political and social impact Four violent crimes committed during the week of 18 July 2016, three of them by asylum seekers, created significant political pressure for changes in the Angela Merkel administration policy of welcoming refugees. The Wall Street Journal reported that two notorious crimes committed by asylum seekers in consecutive weeks in December 2016 had added fuel to debates on immigration and surveillance in Germany. The Siegaue rape case as well as the 2017 Kandel stabbing attack, in which a migrant who had been denied refugee status but who had not been deported killed his 16-year-old ex-girlfriend, intensified the discussion about admitting migrants. The rape and murder of 14-year-old Susanna Feldmann in Wiesbaden in May 2018 sparked a debate on how the 20-year- old Kurdish Iraqi suspect and his family were able to leave the country using fake identities after the murder, as well as how he had been able to stay in Germany after his asylum application had been rejected. Criminologists commenting on the situation in 2018 pointed out that the demographics of the migrants is an important factor: young males (of all origins) were responsible for half of all violent crimes in 2014, and young men made up 27% of all asylum-seekers who came in 2015. Dr Dominic Kudlacek, of the Criminological Research Unit of Lower Saxony lists other risk factors such as social deprivation, being alone, living in refugee camps with little privacy and spending most of their time with other people suffering from these risk factors which can add to the likelihood of committing crimes. Criminologist Simon Cottee cites sociologist Stanley Cohen when he suggests that fear of immigrant crime among Germans is a form of moral panic to which societies are subject from time to time.

Early life and education Walpole was the second son of diplomat Thomas Walpole of Stagbury Park, Surrey and Lady Margaret Perceval, the eighth daughter of John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont. His elder brother was Spencer Horatio Walpole and his first cousin was Horatio Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford. He was educated at Dr. Goodenough's school at Ealing and at Eton College and received a commission as ensign in the Rifle Brigade on 11 May 1825. Career He was promoted to lieutenant the following year and served with his corps in Nova Scotia (1825‚Äì36), Ireland, Birmingham during the bread riots (1839), Jersey, and Malta (1841‚Äì43). He rose through the ranks to lieutenant-colonel in 1847, when he was appointed to the staff as deputy- adjutant and quartermaster-general at Corfu. He remained there until 1856, having been promoted to colonel in the army in 1854. In 1857 Walpole went to India to take part in the suppression of the Indian Mutiny. He arrived at Cawnpore early in November, and commanded, under Major-general Windham, a detachment of the Rifle Brigade at the Pandu Nudda. On 28 November, in command of the left brigade, he defeated the right attack of the Gwalior contingent, and Windham reported that Walpole had 'achieved a complete victory over the enemy and captured two 18-pounder guns.‚Äô Walpole commanded the 6th brigade of the army under Sir Colin Campbell at the Battle of Cawnpore on 6 December 1857. The brigade was composed of the 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Rifle Brigade and a detachment of the 38th Foot. Crossing the canal and moving along the outskirts of the western face of the town, Walpole successfully prevented the enemy's centre from supporting their right, which had been turned by the British 4th and 5th brigades. On 18 December Walpole, with a detached corps of the army, consisting of the 6th brigade with the addition of a field battery, a troop of horse artillery, and a company of sappers, marched through the Doab, captured Etawa on 29 December, and on 3 January 1858 reached Bewar, where Brigadier-general Seaton's force, which had arrived already, came under his command. Walpole, with the combined force, joined Sir Colin Campbell at Fatehgarh on the following day. =Capture of Lucknow= The town of Lucknow had been abandoned to rebel forces after Sir Colin Campbell had raised the Siege of Lucknow the previous year (1857). While Sir Colin Campbell made preparations for the its recapture an attack was feigned on Bareilly to keep the Rohilkhand rebels in check, and Walpole was sent with his force to make a demonstration against 15,000 rebels assembled at Allahganj on the banks of the Ramganga river, a mission which he carried out to the satisfaction of the commander-in-chief. In February 1858 Walpole's force crossed the Ganges with the rest of the army into Oudh on the way to recapture Lucknow, at which Walpole commanded the third division, comprising the 5th and 6th brigades. He occupied the Dilkusha position on 4 March, and moved under Sir James Outram across the Gumti early on the morning of the 6th to take the enemy in reverse. On the evening of the same day he encamped about four miles from and facing the city. On 9 March, after a heavy cannonade, he attacked the enemy's left, driving the rebels to the river and joining the British left at the Badshah Bagh. On the 11th Walpole gained a position commanding the iron bridge. He surprised and captured the camp of Hashmat Ali Chaodri of Sandila, together with that of the mutinous 15th irregulars, taking their standards and two guns. He retained the positions he occupied, and kept up an enfilading fire, raking the positions which the commander-in-chief was assailing on the other side of the river. When Outram entered Lucknow on the 16th, Walpole was left to watch the iron and stone bridge, and repulsed a strong attack made upon his pickets. =After Lucknow= After the capture of Lucknow Walpole was sent in command of a division, consisting of the 9th Lancers, the 2nd Punjab Cavalry, the 42nd Foot, the 79th Foot, and the 93rd Highlanders, the 4th Punjab Rifles, two troops of horse artillery, two 18-pounder guns, two 8-inch howitzers, and some engineers, to march through Rohilkhand. He left Lucknow on 7 April, and on the 15th attacked Fort Ruhya, and was repulsed with considerable loss, although the enemy evacuated the fort the same night. Walpole's conduct of this operation has been severely censured but the strictures passed upon him were undeserved. On the occasion in question Walpole undervalued his enemy, and in consequence many valuable lives were lost; but the commander-in-chief was fully cognisant of all that took place, and, so far from losing confidence in Walpole, continued to employ him in positions of trust and in important commands. Walpole reached Sirsa on 22 April, and defeated the rebels at Allahganj, capturing four guns. On the 27th he was joined by the commander-in- chief, marched on Shahjahanpur, which, on the 30th, they found evacuated by the enemy, and pushed on without opposition, reaching Miranpur Katra on 3 May. Walpole commanded the troops under Lord Clyde at the Battle of Bareilly on 5 May, when he was wounded by a sabre cut, and his horse wounded in three places. He commanded the Rohilkhand division from 1858 to 1860, and commanded in person at the fight of Maler Ghat on the river Sarda on 15 January 1859, when, with 360 men, 60 only of whom were Europeans, he entirely defeated 2,500 of the enemy and took two guns. =Later life= For his services in the Indian mutiny Walpole received the medal with clasp for Lucknow; he was made first a Companion, and then a Knight Commander, of the Order of the Bath, military division, and he received the thanks of Parliament. In 1861 he commanded the Lucknow division, but in the same year was transferred to the command of the infantry brigade at Gibraltar. He was promoted to be major- general on 30 May 1862; brought home in 1864 to command the Chatham military district which he relinquished in 1866 and given the Colonelcy of the 65th (2nd Yorkshire, North Riding) Regiment of Foot in 1869. He was promoted Lieutenant-General on 25 October 1871 and was selected for command at the autumn man≈ìuvres of 1872. Personal life He married Gertrude Ford, the youngest daughter of General William Henry Ford of the Royal Engineers and had nine children, of which two sons and three daughters survived him. Walpole died on 12 July 1876 at the Grove, West Molesey, Surrey. A watercolour portrait of Walpole by Alfred Edward Chalon (1826) and an oil portrait by John Phillip (1847), both in Rifle Brigade uniform, were formerly in possession of his widow, Lady Walpole of Hampton Court Palace.

It is also sometimes referred to as \\"microbiology of the built environment\\". This field encompasses studies of any kind of microorganism (e.g. bacteria, archaea, viruses, various microbial eukaryotes including yeasts, and others sometimes generally referred to as protists) and studies of any kind of built environment such as buildings, vehicles, and water systems. Some key highlights emphasizing the growing importance of the field include: * The field has accelerated somewhat in recent years, with significant funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. and with the increase attention being given to microbiomes and communities of microbes generally. * The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine of the USA is conducting a study of this field with the study entitled Microbiomes of the Built Environment: From Research to Application\\". * The American Association for the Advancement of Science ran a symposium on the topic in 2014. * The American Academy of Microbiology had a colloquium on this topic in September 2015 and published a report \\"Microbiology of Built Environments\\". A 2016 paper by Brent Stephens highlights some of the key findings of studies of \\"microbiomes of the indoor environment\\". These key findings include those listed below: * \\"Culture-independent methods reveal vastly greater microbial diversity compared to culture-based methods\\" * \\"Indoor spaces often harbor unique microbial communities\\" * \\"Indoor bacterial communities often originate from indoor sources.\\" * \\"Humans are also major sources of bacteria to indoor air\\" * \\"Building design and operation can influence indoor microbial communities.\\" The microbiomes of the built environment are being studied for multiple reasons including how they may impact the health of humans and other organisms occupying the built environment but also some non health reasons such as diagnostics of building properties, for forensic application, impact on food production, impact on built environment function, and more.  Types of Built Environments For Which Microbiomes Have Been Studied  Extensive research has been conducted on individual microbes found in the built environment. More recently there has been a significant expansion in the number of studies that are examining the communities of microbes (i.e., microbiomes) found in the built environment. Such studies of microbial communities in the built environment have covered a wide range of types of built environments including those listed below. _Buildings_. Examples include homes, dormitories, offices, hospitals, operating rooms, NICUs, classrooms, transportation facilities such as train and subway stations, food production facilities (e.g. dairies, wineries, cheesemaking facilities, sake breweries and beer breweries , aquaria, libraries, cleanrooms, zoos, animal shelters, farms, and chicken coops and housing. _Vehicles_. Examples include airplanes, ships, trains, automobiles and space vehicles including International Space Station, MIR, the Mars Odyssey, the Herschel Spacecraft. _Water Systems_. Examples include shower heads, children's paddling pools, municipal water systems, drinking water and premise plumbing systems and saunas. _Other_. Examples include art and cultural heritage items, clothing, kitchen sponges, and household appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines.  Results from Studies of the Microbiomes of the Built Environment  = General Biogeography = Overall the many studies that have been conducted on the microbiomes of the built environment have started to identify some general patterns regarding the microbes are found in various places. For example, Adams et al., in a comparative analysis of ribosomal RNA based studies in the built environment found that geography and building type had strong associations with the types of microbes seen in the built environment. Pakpour et al. in 2016 reviewed the patterns relating to the presence of archaea in indoor environments (based on analysis of rRNA gene sequence data). = Human Health and Microbiomes of the Built Environment = Many studies have documented possible human health implications of the microbiomes of the built environment (e.g., ). Examples include those below. _Newborn colonization_. The microbes that colonize newborns come in part from the built environment (e.g., hospital rooms). This appears to be especially true for babies born by C-section (see for example Shin et al. 2016 ) and also babies that spend time in a NICU. _Risk of allergy and asthma_. The risk of allergy and asthma is correlated to differences in the built environment microbiome. Some experimental tests (e.g., in mice) have suggested that these correlations may actually be causal (i.e., the differences in the microbiomes may actually lead to differences in risk of allergy or asthma). Review papers on this topic include Casas et al. 2016 and Fujimura and Lynch 2015. Studies of dust in various homes has shown that the microbiome found in the dust is correlated to the risk of children in those homes developing allergy, asthma, or phenotypes connected to these ailments. The impact of the microbiome of the built environment on the risk of allergy and asthma and other inflammatory or immune conditions is a possible mechanism underlying what is known as the hygiene hypothesis. _Mental health_. In a 2015 review Hoisington et al. discuss possible connections between the microbiology of the built environment and human health. The concept presented in this paper is that more and more evidence is accumulating that the human microbiome has some impact on the brain and thus if the built environment either directly or indirectly impacts the human microbiome, this in turn could have impacts on human mental health. _Pathogen transmission_. Many pathogens are transmitted in the built environment and may also reside in the built environment for some period of time. Good examples include influenza, Norovirus, Legionella, and MRSA. The study of the transmission and survival of these pathogens is a component of studies of microbiomes of the built environment. _Indoor Air Quality_ The study of Indoor air quality and the health impact of such air quality is linked at least in part to microbes in the built environment since they can impact directly or indirectly indoor air quality. = Components of the Built Environment that Likely Impact Microbiomes = A major component of studies of Microbiomes of the Built Environment involves determining how components of the built environment impact these microbes and microbial communities. Factors that are thought to be important include humidity, pH, chemical exposures, temperature, filtration, surface materials, and air flow. There has been an effort to develop standards for what built environment \\"metadata\\" to collect associated with studies of the microbial communities in the built environment. A 2014 paper reviews the tools that are available to improve the built environment data that is collected associated with such studies. Examples of types of built environment data covered in this review include building characteristics and environmental conditions, HVAC system characteristics and ventilation rates, human occupancy and activity measurements, surface characterizations and air sampling and aerosol dynamics. = Impact of Microbiomes on the Built Environment = Just as the built environment has an impact on the microbiomes found therein, the microbial communities of the built environment can impact the built environment itself. Examples include degradation of building materials, altering fluid and airflow, generating volatiles, and more. = Possible Uses in Forensics = The microbiome of the built environment has some potential for being used as a feature for forensic studies. Most of these applications are still in the early research phase. For example, it has been shown that people leave behind a somewhat diagnostic microbial signature when they type on computer keyboards, use phones or occupy a room. = Odor and Microbes in the Built Environment = There has been a significant amount of research on the role that microbes play in various odors in the built environment. For example, Diekmann et al. examined the connection between volatile organic emissions in automobile air conditioning units. They reported that the types of microbes found were correlated to the bad odors found. Park and Kim examined which microbes found in an automobile air conditioner could produce bad smelling volatile compounds and identified candidate taxa producing some such compounds.  Methods Used  Many methods are used to study microbes in built environment. A review of such methods are some of the challenges in using them was published by NIST. Hoisington et al. in 2015 reviewed methods that could be used by building professionals to study the microbiology of the built environment. Methods used in the study of microbes in the built environment include culturing (with subsequent studies of the cultured microbes), microscopy, air, water and surface sampling, chemical analyses, and culture independent DNA studies such as ribosomal RNA gene PCR and metagenomics.

Located near the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park in Valencia, California, United States, it was a favorite of filmmakers for its versatility and location within the thirty-mile zone until its owners returned the site to farming in 1990 following a reduced interest in the kind of action television programs and films that had been produced there. The company reportedly grossed up to $600,000 (US dollars, 1990) annually at one time. Productions The site portrayed the American Southwest, Brazil, Japan, France and Germany, Africa, Afghanistan, Burma, Central America and often Vietnam. It featured hills, flat plains, riverbeds and densely wooded forest land that could portray locations around the world. In exchange for reduced rental rates, previous productions had also left behind standing sets including a village, labor-camp, prison, ranch house, military barracks and railroad line including locomotive and train cars that could be re-used, reducing production costs. The location is best known for a helicopter accident which occurred there during the making of Twilight Zone: The Movie which claimed the lives of actor Vic Morrow and two child actors, 7-year-old Myca Dinh Le and 6-year-old Renee Shin-Yi Chen. The site was popular with television programs in the 1980s such as The A-Team, MacGyver, The Fall Guy and The Incredible Hulk as well as films including The Color Purple and Escape From New York. China Beach was the last television production shot there. Music videos featuring bands such as Van Halen and the Fixx were also filmed at the ranch. Other uses Newhall Land & Farming Company built Indian Dunes Airport on the site in the 1960s with a single unpaved runway running northeast to southwest. The airport was used for company aircraft and was sometimes leased to film and television shows including 84 Charlie MoPic and Baa Baa Black Sheep. The site hosted the Indian Dunes Motor Recreation Park, a multi-track motocross and track racing park during the 1970s and 1980s.

History The reserve was proposed in 1996 after several studies by environmental bodies and NGOs, and in response to the demands of the local inhabitants who saw value in protecting the environment, regularising use of land and river resources, and helping community organisation, health and education. This was followed by several years of discussion about the most appropriate form of conservation unit and about the transfer of responsibility between the federal and state governments. The Uatum√£ Sustainable Development Reserve was created by Amazonas state governor decree 24.295 of 25 June 2004 in the basin of the Uatum√£ River with an area of about . The basic objective was to preserve nature and at the same time ensure the conditions and means needed to sustain and improve the livelihood and quality of life of the traditional populations exploiting the natural resources, while preserving and improving knowledge and techniques developed by those populations for managing the environment. It became part of the Central Amazon Ecological Corridor, established in 2002. The conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. On 16 August 2006 the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform ‚Äì INCRA) recognised the reserve as supporting 250 families of small rural producers who could participate in PRONAF. On 18 March 2008 the deliberative council was created. On 9 June 2010 the entire territory became state property. The management plan was approved on 18 October 2010. On 7 April 2015 a sum of R$450,000 was allocated to the reserve to offset the irreversible negative environmental impacts from implementation and operation of the Tucuru√≠ transmission line (Linh√£o de Tucuru√≠). This is a hydroelectric power transmission line between the Tucuru√≠ Dam in Par√° and Manaus. Hydrology The rainy season lasts from February to April, with average rainfall of in March and April respectively. The dry season is from July to October. Rainfall averages in August and September. There are wide variations in rainfall from one year to another. When the Amazon is high there are greater areas of wetlands in the reserve. The Uatum√£ River's flow is regulated by the Balbina Dam, built in 1987, which is just in a direct line from the reserve, and this reduces flooding to some extent. Environment Avifauna The Uatum√£ Sustainable Development Reserve is of great biological importance. It preserves the remains of the riverine environment that was largely destroyed with construction of the Balbina Dam. The vegetation is mainly terra firma forest, but there are areas of igap√≥, campina and campinarana. Common plants that may have economic potential include bacaba, pintadinha, brom√©lias, sucupira, jauari, ma√ßaramduba and breu. The campinas (meadows) have significant potential for tourism due to their scenic beauty and large amounts of bromeliads and orchids. Creation of the reserve was motivated in part by the need to provide a shelter for the Martins's tamarin (Saguinus martinsi), considered rare and probably endemic to the reserve and its surroundings. Research on fauna during preparation of the management plan identified 26 species of mammals including the threatened ocelot, jaguar and giant anteater. Aquatic mammals include Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) and neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis). The reserve does not have large stocks of commercially useful fish. The dolphins and otters often attack fish caught in gill nets set by the residents of the reserve. The reserve provides an egg- laying area for threatened species of turtles. The Arrau turtle (Podocnemis expansa) is relatively rare. Turtles are caught for consumption or sale, as elsewhere in the Amazon region. Maracarana Lake has the highest number of turtles and has been protected by residents in partnership with Eletrobras ‚Äì Manaus Energia since 1985. In 1998 IBAMA declared Maracarana a protected lake, where gill nets and turtle capture are banned. Economy Sunset In 2006 the Uatum√£ Sustainable Development Reserve had about 250 families with 1,300 people in total. As of 2007 the population was 54% male, 46% female. 42.8% were under thirteen years of age. There are about twenty riverine communities in the reserve. Most of the communities are small farmers growing cassava, banana, watermelon, corn and beans for sale and for personal consumption. A variety of other crops are also grown, totalling about 40 species. Most communities raise livestock for milk and meat, and for sale in the rainy season when there is no income from agriculture. Pigs are the main farmed animal, followed by sheep, goats and poultry. Two communities are developing honey production from stingless bees. Rubber and nuts are among the products extracted from the forest. One community (Leandro Grande) mainly engages in timber extraction and one (Monte das Oliveiras) mainly extracts forest products such as straw, vines and pitch. Timber is extracted for use in local construction, with only a few residents engaged in the timber trade. There is some illegal logging, but the communities are motivated to prevent it due to the low price fetched for timber without a certificate of legal origin. Residents engage in small-scale fishing and hunting, mainly for personal consumption. The common agouti, red brocket, curassow and peccary are hunted.

It massed at launch, had a power production capacity of 15 kW and a 15-year design life. Its payload is composed of 61 Ku band and 10 Ka band transponders. Eutelsat leased much of its capacity broadcasting and IP services and positioned it in the 36¬∞ East slot under the Eutelsat 36C designation. It is part of the Ekspress series of RSCC. History On November 2, 2012, RSCC and Eutelsat announced a 15-year agreement to lease capacity on two satellites to be launched in 2013 and 2015. It would be used for broadcasting and IP services and was valued at 300 million euro. The first satellite was Ekspress-–ê–¢2, already on order, and the second was Ekspress- AMU1, which construction was to be bid later that year. During 2012 RSCC organized a competition among EADS Astrium (later Airbus Defense and Space), Thales Alenia Space, MDA and ISS Reshetnev to build Ekspress-AMU1. Eutelsat participated from the selection committee since they intended to lease capacity on board the satellite. In May 2013 Airbus announced that it had been awarded a contract by RSCC to build Ekspress-AMU1. Also known as Eutelsat 36C, it would be the follow up of Eutelsat 36A at the 36¬∞ East slot. Based on the Eurostar 3000 it would mass around at launch, have an end of life power production of 15 kW and a design life of 15 years. It was expected to be launched by a Proton-M in 2015. Airbus bid, while slightly more expensive than Thales', promised to deliver the satellite seven months earlier. By early 2015 the satellite was planned for a September or October 2015 launch, but the satellite was delivered to the launch site in Baikonur on November 12. The launch was then set for December 23, but weather conditions required a day delay. On December 24, 2015, at 21:31:19 UTC, a Proton-M/Briz-M successfully launched from Site 200/39. On January 1, 2016, RSCC announced that Ekspress- AMU1 had reached the geostationary orbit. On February 10, signals from Eutelsat 36A were switched to Ekspress-AMU1 marking the final commissioning of the satellite into service.

An effective advocate for her tribe, she garnered millions of dollars in federal and state funds to improve the infrastructure on the Yavapai reservation. She negotiated a water settlement agreement between the federal government and the tribe and established the first gaming license for any Indian tribe in Arizona. She helped develop a community center which earned a federal design award and served as an educational center to preserve both the culture and language of the Yavapai. In 2006, McGee was nominated by Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame. Early life Patricia Ann Vaughn was born on July 9, 1926 in Holbrook, Arizona to Amy (n√©e Jimulla) and Albert Vaughn. Her heritage was half Yavapai and half Hualapai. After her mother's death in 1940, Vaughan and her brother went to live with their grandparents, Sam and Viola Jimulla, chief and chieftess of the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe. Vaughn attended the Indian school at Valentine, Arizona and then graduated from Prescott High School. She continued her studies and was an honor student at the Haskell University in Lawrence, Kansas and took extension courses at the University of Kansas in psychology and public speaking. In the 1950s, she married Korean War veteran, Ernest McGee (1931-1994). Career Beginning in 1966, McGee worked in the tribal government. She first served as tribal secretary-treasurer and then in 1968 was elected as Vice President, serving two terms. Because of the dual system of governance established when Viola Jimulla took over as chieftess of the tribe, Jimulla was succeeded as chieftess by her daughters Grace Mitchell in 1967 and upon Mitchell's death in 1976, by Lucy Miller. However, the Tribal Council, which had been established in 1940 was led by Grace's husband, Don S. Mitchell until 1972 when McGee was elected as president. When Miller was appointed as chieftess, McGee was reconfirmed as president of the tribe. She served for 16 years before being ousted by Stanhope \\"Stan\\" Rice, Jr. in 1988. After he served one term, McGee was re-elected in 1990 and served until her death. In 1971, McGee returned to school, studying at Prescott College and earning a degree in social anthropology. When McGee took over as president in 1972, she stated that her goal was to focus on building the tribal resources. One of her projects was to secure government funds for a tribal community center. After years of losing out funds to the community, the tribe, and an organization of non-native citizens from nearby Prescott, Arizona called Friends of the Yavapai, were successful in obtaining funds in 1974. The goals for the center were to establish a library and preserve both cultural history and language. McGee was one of the founders of the Yavapai Language Program. She was awarded a state citation for her work on the project by Governor Jack Williams and the project received a national urban design and management award from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). McGee garnered another federal grant in 1975 for the tribe to build an industrial complex to increase job opportunities. In 1976, the Horizons on Display project of the tribe was selected as one of two Arizona projects honored by the national Bicentennial celebration. Though McGee had helped with the project and attained over a million dollars in grants for the tribe as their business manager, she was ousted from the position in 1977, because the tribe felt that her serving as both business manager and president was a conflict of interest. McGee secured millions of dollars from both the federal government and the City of Prescott to build a resort and conference center for the tribe. She leased reservation lands for shopping centers to earn tribal revenue and negotiated terms for a water settlement between the government and the tribe. In 1992, McGee signed the first compact with the State of Arizona for Indian Gaming, adding Bucky's Casino to the Prescott Resort. Her efforts to improve the economic prospects of her tribe gained national recognition in Time, Fortune and the Wall Street Journal. In addition to her economic development projects, McGee served on the State Civil Rights Advisory Board and was appointed by President Richard Nixon to serve on the National Advisory Council on Indian Education (NACIE). She also served on the boards of both a national and state Inter-tribal association. McGee died on April 6, 1994 in Phoenix, Arizona and was buried at the Yavapai-Prescott Tribal Cemetery on the reservation. Posthumously, she was inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame in 2006, after being nominated by Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.

The lower caste and untouchable women were expected to pay the government a tax on their breasts, as soon as they started developing breasts. The lower caste men had to pay a similar tax, called tala-karam, on their heads. Travancore tax collectors would visit every house to collect the Breast Tax from any lower caste women who passed the age of puberty. The tax was evaluated by the tax collectors depending on the size of their breasts.  Background  The breast tax was supposedly forced by the landowning Brahmin king on lower caste Hindu women, which was to be paid if they wanted to cover their breasts and was further assessed in proportion to the size of their breasts. This was seen as a sign of respect towards the upper caste and the lower castes including Nadar and Ezhava women had to pay the \\"breast tax\\" Dr Sheeba KM, Professor of gender ecology and Dalit studies says the very purpose of the breast tax was to maintain the caste hierarchy. The law resulted from Travancore's tradition, in which the breast was bared as a symbol of respect to higher-status people. For example, the Nair women were not allowed to cover their bosoms while in front of the Namboodiri Brahmins or entering the temples, while the Brahmins bared their breasts only to the images of the deities. The women of the even lower castes, such as Nadars, Ezhavars and untouchables castes, were not allowed to cover their breasts at all. With the spread of Christianity in the 19th century, the Christian converts among the Nadar women started covering their upper body, and gradually, even the Hindu Nadar women adopted this practice. After a series of protests, the Nadar women were granted the right to cover their breasts in 1859. Multiple historians have documented that uncovering one's breasts was revered as a symbolic token of homage from the lower castes towards the upper castes in the state of Travancore and a state-law prevented this covering which served to demarcate the caste hierarchy in a prominent manner and often served as the core locus of spontaneous rebellions by lower castes.  Channar Revolt  During the time of Travancore, lower-caste women were not allowed to wear clothes that covered their breasts. Higher-class women covered both breasts and shoulders, whereas lower castes including Nadar and Ezhava women were not allowed to cover their breasts, to show their low status. They had to pay the breast tax if they wanted to cover themselves. Uneasy with their social status, a large number of Nadars embraced Christianity, and started to wear long cloths. When many more Nadar women turned to Christianity, many Hindu Nadar women also started to wear the Nair breast cloth. This led to violence between the upper caste and lower castes. From 1813 to 1859 several laws were enacted and removed by the Kingdom of Travancore regarding the upper cloth issue. On one such occasion the members of the king's council argued that this right would remove the caste-differences and pollute the kingdom. Agitations and violence continued against the lower caste Christian and Hindu women on the right to cover their breasts and several schools and churches were burned. Several waves of violence continued for four decades. In 1859 the violence reached its peak when two Nadar women were stripped of their upper clothes and hung on a tree in public for covering their breasts by Travancore officials. The Nadars revolted in ferocity and started to terrorize the upper caste neighborhoods and looted their shops. Thus the kingdom was forced to take action on the upper cloth law to bring peace in the kingdom. In the same year, under pressure from the Madras governor, the king issued the right for all Nadar women to cover their breasts. Yet they were still not allowed in the style of the higher-class women which the Nadar women did not follow.  The story of Nangeli  The village-legend Nangeli is about a woman who lived in the early 19th century at Cherthala in the erstwhile princely state of Travancore in India and supposedly, cut off her breasts in an effort to protest against the caste-based breast tax. The village officer of Travancore, came to her home to survey her breasts and collect the breast tax. Nangeli revolted against the harassment; cutting off her breasts and presenting them to him in a plantain leaf. She died soon from loss of blood. According to local villagers, Nangeli's husband, Chirukandan, seeing her mutilated body was overcome by grief and jumped into her funeral pyre and committed suicide. Following the death of Nangeli, a series of people's movements were set off. Soon the place she lived had come to be called as Mulachiparambu (meaning place of the breasted woman). However, the story is not officially recognized in any of India's historical accounts and its authenticity is debatable.

Haanstra was notable for his chairmanship of IBM's SPREADSystems Programming, Research, Engineering, And Development task force whose work led to the creation of the System/360 product line. Early career Born in San Francisco, California, Haanstra graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949 with a degree in electrical engineering. In 1950 he went to work for IBM in Poughkeepsie, New York. During the Korean War he was recalled to serve in the Navy. Following his discharge he rejoined IBM in 1952 in the San Jose Laboratory. He was responsible for designing the IBM 305 RAMAC, \\"the first commercial computer that used a moving-head hard disk drive\\", announced in 1956. 1401 and System/360 In 1957 he was promoted to assistant general manager of General Products Division (GPD), and in 1961 he became president of the division. There he oversaw the deployment of the highly successful 1401 computer system. Also in 1961 IBM vice president T. Vincent Learson established the 12-person SPREAD task group, with Haanstra as chairman and Bob O. Evans as vice chairman. The result, a 26-page report, was published in December, 1961, and \\"became the basis for the System/360 series and its operating system.\\" Haanstra agreed that GPD would produce the low-end model of System/360 that became the Model 30. However, he was not fully on board with the \\"New Product Line\\" (NPL) as System/360 was known at the time. To compete with the newly announced 1401-compatible Honeywell 200 system, Haanstra had GPD secretly produce a plan for a much faster 1401S system, which he presented to IBM President Thomas Watson Jr. in January, 1964, along with a suggestion that he delay the introduction of the Model 30. Although Watson praised the plan, in the event Haanstra was removed as president of GPD, and the 360 project continued as planned. Later career at IBM Despite his demotion (Evans calls it \\"IBM purgatory\\"), in 1965 Haanstra was appointed president of IBM's newly formed Systems Development Division (SDD), responsible for all IBM computer research and development. Later that year, however, delays in System/360 manufacturing caused Watson to remove Haanstra from SDD and assign him to a committee called the \\"four horsemen\\" along with John Gibson, Clarence E. Frizzell, and Henry E. Cooley. The committee was to coordinate all IBM manufacturing and laboratory locations and \\"decide how to meet System/360 manufacturing commitments.\\" In 1966 Bob Evans lobbied and had Haanstra appointed vice president of the IBM Federal Systems Division (FSD) Federal Systems Center. General Electric In August 1967 Haanstra left IBM and went to work for General Electric's computer division in Phoenix, Arizona as special assistant to the head of GE's Information Systems Division, and in 1968 he was appointed head of advanced planning At General Electric Haanstra contributed to the design of Project Charlie, a line of medium sized machines intended to compete with System/360. He recommended the development of microcodeed peripheral controllers rather than hard wired units. It is likely that it was on his recommendation that emitter-coupled logic (ECL) was chosen as the technology to be used for the new system. In 1968 Haanstra assumed responsibility for the \\"GE655\\" project in Phoenix, later the GE6000 that became the Honeywell 6000 series. Death In 1969, flying his private plane back to Phoenix from a trip to Vermont, Hannstra, his wife, June (Hill) Haanstra, and their son Glenn were killed when the plane crashed near Clines Corners, New Mexico on August 16, 1969, on the final leg between Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Phoenix.

Edited and published by Michael Gerber, it features contributions from many notable comedy writers, illustrators and cartoonists. The Bystander is designed to provide a classic print humor magazine experience similar to that delivered by National Lampoon, SPY, Harold Hayes-era Esquire and many others in the pre-internet era. Yet according to The New York Times, The American Bystander \\"does not just belong to the tradition of defunct magazines like The National Lampoon and Spy. Its nostalgic, lightly witty style evokes influences that have been dead even longer, like the raconteur Jean Shepherd and the sophisticated stylist Robert Benchley.\\"Jason Zinoman, \\"Titanic Still Afloat: The American Bystander Publishes Second Issue.\\" https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/arts/the-american-bystander-humor-magazine- publishes-second-issue.html?_r=0 July 11, 2016. The Bystander emerged after several years of planning by Gerber, head writer Brian McConnachie, and Alan Goldberg. Issue #1 was successfully funded on Kickstarter on November 13, 2015. This 146-page softcover book featured work by Jack Handey, George Meyer, Roz Chast, Terry Jones, and many others. Issue #2 successfully funded April 21, 2016, with material from even more contributors than the first, including Merrill Markoe, Simon Rich, Todd Hanson, Nell Scovell and a cover by Charles Barsotti. After the first two issues received a positive review in The New York Times in July 2016, issue #3 appeared in November 2016. Since then, issues of The Bystander have been produced on a roughly quarterly basis, increasing to bimonthly in 2019. The staff continues to increase: to date, over 250 writers and artists have contributed to the magazine. Issues are available via an permanent crowdfunding campaign via Patreon, as well as conventional bookstore channels; this allows the magazine to employ a \\"thousand true fans\\" model. It reached break-even in April 2019, a signal achievement for an independent, reader-funded magazine. In an era of lightning-fast comedy shared over social media, \\"The editors of Bystander think of the quarterly as the comedy equivalent of 'slow food.'\\"\\"New Humor Magazine THE AMERICAN BYSTANDER Returns for Issue #2 via Kickstarter\\" http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwcomedy/article/New-Humor-Magazine-THE- AMERICAN-BYSTANDER-Returns-for-Issue-2-via-Kickstarter-20160329 (29 March 2016) Publishing model The American Bystander uses an innovative reader- focused publishing model.Lichterman, Joseph. \\"The American Bystander is trying to revive the humor magazine with a reader-supported business model\\" http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/04/the-american-bystander-is-trying-to-revive- the-humor-magazine-with-a-reader-supported-business-model/ (27 April 2016) This was developed by Gerber in response to the longstanding commercial/distribution problems specific to print humor magazines, which had kept the United States without a national \\"slick\\" humor magazine since the demise of National Lampoon and SPY in 1998. Though it does promote projects by contributors (for example, books by Mimi Pond, Dave Hill or Mallory Ortberg), The American Bystander does not currently run paid advertising. Instead, it uses social media and crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo to gather readers willing to pay a price which reflects the actual printing and shipping costs of each issue. This grass-roots model allowed The Bystander to launch without the backing of a large corporation or wealthy individual, while still achieving a high-quality product and paying its contributors. On an ongoing basis, Bystander's reader-focused model prevents publishing-side encroachment on editorial, as happened at National Lampoon after the 1975 buyout of Henry Beard, Doug Kenney, and Rob Hoffman; the necessity of courting a national audience to satisfy advertisers (as with late-period SPY); or the unpredictable actions of a financial patron as was suffered by Harvey Kurtzman's ill-fated Trump. 1982 pilot issue In the early 1980s, writer/editor Brian McConnachie conceived a large-format (11 x 15 in.) bimonthly magazine he hoped would occupy the space between The National Lampoon and The New Yorker. Calling on friends and colleagues from SCTV and Saturday Night Live, McConnachie received backing from Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Brian Doyle-Murray, Lorne Michaels, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, G.E. Smith, Harold Ramis, Dave Thomas, and Jack Ziegler. This allowed McConnachie and Managing Editor Jennifer Finney Boylan to produce a 32-page pilot issue for prospective backers, featuring material from John Caldwell, Sam Gross, Jeff Jones, M.K. Brown, David Boswell, Charles Burns, Garry Winogrand, Mike Wilkins, Doug Kirby, and others. In a letter introducing the issue, McConnachie said that The American Bystander would tap \\"one of our greatest resources‚Äîthe inventiveness, the style and the independence of the American character. And that of several Canadians as well. Just a few, not enough to affect the title.\\"Brian McConnachie, \\"Editorial,\\" p 3, The American Bystander, New York: The American Bystander Publishing Company, 1982. Unfortunately, despite an appearance on the then-new Late Night with David Letterman to promote the project, luck was not with McConnachie, and this early version of The American Bystander never went into production, instead remaining one of the great what-ifs of that generation of comedy. In 2012, McConnachie and Alan Goldberg approached their friend Gerber, and asked him to apply humor-specific publishing/editing models he'd learned self-publishing Barry Trotter and the Shameless Parody and resurrecting The Yale Record to make a new and improved Bystander which combined the sensibility of the '82 attempt with the publishing realities of the post-Internet age. Gerber referred to the 1982 edition extensively while creating the editorial structure of the 2015 magazine. This backstory was first revealed in Boylan's column in The New York Times.

Jurisich and Manning left A Hundred Monkeys in 2002 to co-found Igor Naming Agency. In addition to established companies including Nokia, EA Sports, and MTV, Igor worked extensively with companies founded following the dot-com downturn of 2000.

Nineteen people were killed and twenty-six others were injured, thirteen severely, at a care home for disabled people. The suspect was a 26-year-old man, identified as , a former employee of the care facility. Uematsu surrendered at a nearby police station with a bag of knives and was subsequently arrested. The attack was described as one of the worst crimes committed on Japanese soil in modern history. Location is a residential care center run by , a social welfare organization. Established by the local government, the facility was built in a area of woodland on the bank of the Sagami River. As of the end of April, the facility housed 149 residents between the ages of 19 and 75, all of whom had an intellectual disability but many with various physical disabilities as well. Some are capable of engaging in physical activities outdoors, while others are bedridden. The facility is located in a remote location about from Sagamiko Station on the Ch≈´≈ç Main Line. Attack At about 02:10, Uematsu allegedly used a hammer to break into the care centre through a glass window on the first floor. He tied up a staff member, took their keys, and then went from room to room, stabbing the victims in their necks as they slept. Police were called to the care center by staff members at around 02:30 local time, reporting a man with a knife breaking into the building. However, Uematsu left the premises before being apprehended; he was recorded leaving the facility at 02:50 in security camera footage. Armed police entered the building at around 03:00 where they discovered the crime scene. Twenty-nine ambulances were sent to the facility. The suspect turned himself in at the Tsukui Police Station two hours after the incident with a bag containing kitchen knives and other bloodstained sharp tools. A knife was reportedly found in his car outside the police station. Uematsu killed ten women and nine men aged between 18 and 70 and injured 26 more, thirteen severely. Perpetrator ', born in 1990, a male aged 26 at the time of the incident, used to work at the care home Tsukui Yamayuri En. His father was an elementary school art teacher, and Uematsu had trained and worked as an elementary school teacher as well. He had lived in his house with his parents, but they moved away at some point and he remained there alone. He resigned from working at the facility in February 2016 after having been employed there for over three years. Neighbors expressed surprise that he had allegedly committed the murders; he was described as a friendly, outgoing and good man. However, some reported that his personality had undergone a change at some point during his employment at the facility. =Letter and statements= In February 2016, Uematsu attempted to hand-deliver a letter to Tadamori ≈åshima, the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Japan, at ≈åshima's home in Tokyo but was prevented from doing so by security. He returned the following day and this time left the letter with the security guards. Uematsu's letter appealed for the legalization of ending the lives of those with multiple disabilities in cases where it was requested by their guardians, and asked for ≈åshima's assistance in delivering his message to Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe. In it, he wrote, \\"I envision a world where a person with multiple disabilities can be euthanised, with an agreement from the guardians, when it is difficult for the person to carry out household and social activities.\\" He also wrote that the killings of the disabled would be \\"for the sake of Japan and world peace\\" as well as to benefit the global economy and prevent World War III. After signing his name, the letter proceeded to detail an offer to target two facilities housing the disabled (possibly a reference to the two residential buildings in which he later committed the crime), and went on to appeal for certain conditions in exchange for committing the act. In the first half of the message, Uematsu said he could kill 460 people; however, in the second half, the number he gave was 260. He added that staff would be tied up to keep them from interfering but that they would not be harmed, the act would be swift, and that afterwards he would turn himself in. At the end of the latter half of the letter, he signed his name again, this time with his address, telephone number, and the name of his employer. At some point, the letter was handed over to Tokyo police, who contacted the police in Sagamihara. During this time frame, Uematsu posted to his Twitter account that he expected he might be arrested. He had previously posted tweets about Japan being ravaged by radiation poisoning and AIDS. Later that month, after his letter was brought to the attention of Sagamihara's authorities, he was arrested, detained, questioned, and then involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital for two weeks. However, he was released on 2 March after doctors deemed that he was not a threat. In his letter and in statements made after turning himself in, Uematsu explained that he was \\"saving from unhappiness\\" both the severely disabled and those who he believed were burdened with maintaining their lives. =Legal proceedings= On 20 February 2017, Uematsu was found mentally competent to stand trial. On 24 February 2019, Uematsu was charged with 19 counts of murder, 24 counts of attempted murder, two counts of illegal confinement causing injury, three counts of illegal confinement, one count of unlawful entry, and one count of violating the swords and firearms control law. Uematsu's defense team said they planned to argue that he was mentally incompetent at the time of the crime, due to the effects of marijuana. On 23 December 2019, Uematsu said he will admit to the crime during the trial, saying that denying the charges against him \\"would be quibbling and make the trial too complex\\".https://www.bbc.com/news/world- asia-50682236 On 8 January 2020, Uematsu pleaded not guilty to the stabbings. On 17 February 2020, the prosecution announced that the death penalty was officially sought against Uematsu saying the rampage was \\"inhumane\\" and that left \\"no room for leniency\\". On 16 March 2020, Uematsu was sentenced to death by the Yokohama District Court, having previously said he would not challenge any verdict or sentence. On 30 March 2020, his death sentence was finalized as he withdrew automatic appeal to the upper courts. Reactions Yoshihide Suga, the Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary at the time, acknowledged that the attack was \\"a very heart-wrenching and shocking incident in which many innocent people became victims\\". He also said that the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare would investigate ways to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. A number of Japanese news outlets ran editorials calling the stabbings a hate crime. By September 2016, little information had been released about the victims of the attack. Reuters wrote that this was due to Japanese culture and stigma being less accepting of physically and cognitively impaired persons. Alt URL The care home has been demolished.

He received his first formal drawing lessons from the architect Christian Vilhelm Nielsen (1833‚Äì1910), then studied perspective at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1868. Later, he received lessons from Frederik Christian Lund (1826‚Äì1901) and Eiler Rasmussen Eilersen (1827‚Äì1912). Jerichau first exhibited in Copenhagen in 1873. Boats Anchored on the Tiber (1871) This was followed by a trip to Italy with his mother. In Rome, he was a pupil of Jean-Achille Benouville (1815-1891), who at that time, was director of the French Academy. After six months there, he made a study trip to Turkey and Greece, spent some time in Paris visited Switzerland and, in 1874, returned to Istanbul with his mother. During this time, he continued to exhibit in Copenhagen. Since he was just a boy, he had been engaged to his cousin, Maria Kutzner (1851-1876). In 1875, she came to Istanbul and they were married. Their first child died at the age of three months. Believing the climate in Turkey to be unfavorable, they moved to Naples. A year later, Maria became violently ill and died in November, 1876. He considered suicide but slowly regained his will to live. In 1878, just as he was beginning to restart his career, he died from a combination of typhus and \\"Italian ague\\" (malaria). He was buried in Rome at the Protestant Cemetery, Cimitero Acattolico. Jens Peter Munk.

He was a member of the band Easy Street, which released three albums. The Easy Street single \\"I've Been Lovin' You\\" entered the Billboard chart in July 1976. In the 1980s, he was best known as the lead singer in cult new wave group Blanket of Secrecy. Marsh also worked with Vangelis, Manfred Mann's Earth Band and Godley & Creme. His songs have been covered by artists including Nick Lowe and Jimmy Ruffin. More recently, Marsh has worked in France. He released the albums Stop the Clock in 2014 and Back to the Beginning in 2017. A second Blanket of Secrecy album, recorded in the 1980s, was released in 2017.  Life and career  Marsh spent his early life in the Lake District, moving to London to work alongside his brother-in-law, Ken Nicol.  Nicol & Marsh / Easy Street  Marsh had a long-standing musical partnership with his then brother-in-law, Ken Nicol, during the 1970s. The duo were known variously as both Nicol & Marsh and as Easy Street, which, for some of this time, also included Richard James Burgess. Marsh first signed to CBS, with Nicol, in 1973 and subsequently signed to Polydor in 1976. Albums released in collaboration with Nicol included: * Nicol & Marsh's Easy Street (Epic / CBS Records, 1974). This album featured Pete Zorn on bass and saxes and was produced by Paul Phillips. Marsh is credited as the sole songwriter on tracks including \\"My Quietness\\", \\"Poor and Lonely Ones\\" and \\"Day by Day\\". Singles included \\"Midnight Cat\\" (1974), \\"I've Been Praying\\" (1974) and \\"Sinking Down\\" (1975), all credited to Nicol-Marsh. Arrangement on the tracks released as singles was by John Barham. The album includes a cover of \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\" (Jack Tempchin). * Easy Street by Easy Street (Polydor, 1976). Easy Street expanded with the addition of Richard James Burgess for this album, which was recorded at Sarm East Studios. The Polydor publicity for the album involved something of a makeover for the band compared to the previous the CBS look, including hairstyles by John Frieda, who appeared on the cover in a cameo guest appearance. A single from the album, \\"I've Been Lovin' You\\" (co-written by Marsh with Richard James Burgess, Ken Nicol & Pete Zorn), entered the US Billboard Charts in July 1976. * Under the Glass by Easystreet (Polydor, 1977). In addition to Marsh, Richard James Burgess and Ken Nicol, the Under the Glass album also extensively featured Kevin Savigar, a long-time musical associate of Rod Stewart. Marsh co-wrote the single track \\"Flying\\" (1977), with Nicol. Five tracks (\\"How Can You Take it So Hard\\", \\"Rely on You\\", \\"What Does The World Know\\", \\"Strange Chance\\" and \\"The Night of the 11th\\") are credited to Nicol, Marsh & Burgess), while two tracks are credited to Marsh and Burgess: \\"Is This Real\\" (Marsh, Burgess) and \\"I See You\\" (Burgess, Marsh). \\"Flying\\" was a released as a single (the B side, \\"Blame The Love\\", didn't appear on the album) and another single, \\"Love at Breakfast\\", which didn't feature on the album, was also released in 1977, with the track \\"Rely on You\\" featuring as the B side. * Nicol & Marsh (Polydor, 1978). The Easy Street name was dropped for the final album in partnership with Nicol, which was recorded in the Pasha Music House, Hollywood. Richard James Burgess was no longer involved, but many renowned Los Angeles session musicians were used on the album, including Bill Payne (Little Feat), Victor Feldman (Steely Dan) and Leland Sklar (James Taylor's bass player). Tracks credited solely to Marsh included \\"As The Years Roll 'Round\\" and \\"Anthem of the Time\\". \\"Holdin' On To You\\" and \\"Lady of Windermere\\" are credited to Nicol & Marsh with two tracks, both released as singles \\"Streets of the Angels\\" (1978) and \\"Hurt By Love\\" (1978) credited to Nicol, Marsh & Bishop. The album includes a cover version of \\"I'll Be Back\\" (Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney). Easy Street toured in Europe and the US and were the 1976 Runners-up of the UK TV show New Faces. The collaboration between Marsh and Nicol ended after the release of the final album. An interview with Nicol implied that Marsh was moving in a different direction, specifically appearing to refer to a growing collaboration between Marsh and Burgess.  Twist  Marsh's first solo project, after breaking up with Nicol was Twist, a transition into the punk rock and new wave genres. Twist band members included Stevie Corduner, formerly of Byzantium (Drums), Wims, a.k.a. Tony Wimshurst (lead guitar, backing vocals), Andy Pask (bass) with Marsh as lead vocalist and acoustic guitarist. Twist released This Is Your Life (Polydor, 1979), an album which included a new wave interpretation of the classic \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\". The title track \\"This Is Your Life\\" was released as a single. The B-side \\"Life's a Commercial Break\\", did not appear on the album. A second single, \\"Ads\\", with the B-side \\"Rebound\\" was released later in 1979. \\"Ads\\" appeared on the Polydor compilation album 20 of Another Kind Vol. 2, with \\"This Is Your Life\\". \\"This Is Your Life\\" featured Steve Nieve on keyboard and Jimmy Edwards and Elvis Costello on backing vocals. The involvement of Jimmy Edwards was due to Marsh's then manager, Tony Gorden, who also managed Sham 69. The involvement of Steve Nieve and Elvis Costello was due to their connections with Roger Bechirian, who co-produced the album with Marsh. Twist was Marsh's first significant collaboration with Bechirian. The two subsequently worked on a project which was to become known as Blanket of Secrecy. Twist was recorded at Amp Pro, a studio in Shepherds Bush in a house owned by Nick Lowe, which was converted by Tony Visconti. It was mixed at Eden Studios in Chiswick. Blanket of Secrecy Marsh was revealed, after more than 20 years, to have been the lead singer (a.k.a. Tinker) in British new wave synthpop band Blanket of Secrecy, which has developed a worldwide cult following over the decades. The identity of the Blanket of Secrecy band members was not initially disclosed, with the Warner Bros Records press release at the time stating that \\"Blanket of Secrecy are three young men engaged in a project of extreme sensitivity and a necessarily classified nature. They have been chosen specifically for their imagination, their dexterity with electric instruments, their ability to compose with panache and style. <..> for reasons of, shall we say diplomacy, we feel compelled to cloak our subjects in a veil of anonymity. Who are they? Where do they come from? That, we're afraid, would be telling.\\" Rumours at the time that they were The Attractions (best known as Elvis Costello's backing band) have subsequently been discredited with the true identity revealed as Peter Marsh, a.k.a. Tinker, Roger Bechirian, a.k.a. Soldier and Andy Howell, a.k.a. Tailor. Marsh co-produced the Blanket of Secrecy album, Walls Have Ears, with Bechirian. It was released in the U.S. by Warner Brothers and in the UK by F-Beat Records (as Ears Have Walls) in 1982. The album has been described by Billboard magazine as \\"an undiscovered classic of the period, pure pop\\". A second Blanket of Secrecy album was recorded back in the 1980s but remained unheard until 2017, when it was released electronically by Trick Records. Vangelis collaboration Marsh worked closely with Greek film composer Vangelis in the early 1980s. He released a single, \\"Don't Be Foolish\\", backed with \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" in 1981 (Polydor Records) which was co-written and produced by Vangelis and recorded at Nemo Studios. Marsh sang on the 1980 Vangelis album See You Later, which has been described as \\"a futuristic look through Vangelis' eyes at life after a nuclear holocaust, the inside cover depicting a man wearing a gas mask and carrying a body.\\" According to Mark J.T. Griffin, \\"The mood of the work has an uncanny resemblance to the brooding atmosphere of the movie Blade Runner.\\" On the first track of the album, \\"I Can't Take It Anymore\\", Marsh's voice is synthesied through a Roland VP330 vocoder. Marsh also sang on \\"My Love\\", a Vangelis single backed with \\"Domestic Logic 1\\", which preceded the See You Later album; both titles being similar in production and style, although neither made it onto the album.  Other Marsh collaborations  * Marsh released the single \\"You Say You Wanna Love Me\\" (1981), which was produced by Godley & Creme, with music and lyrics by Marsh, on Polydor Records. The B-side, \\"I Won't Let You Go\\" was written and produced by Marsh. * Marsh worked as a session singer for Manfred Mann's Earth Band, featuring in several tracks on Chance (1981), on which he sang the lead vocal for \\"Stranded\\" (Mike Heron, Manfred Mann). * Nick Lowe's Abominable Showman (1983) featured \\"Cool Reaction\\", a track co-written by Marsh and Andy Howell. Marsh is also credited as backing vocals on several The Abominable Showman tracks including \\"Paid the Price\\" and \\"Tanque-Rae\\". * Marsh worked with Carlene Carter on the album C'est C Bon along with his Blanket of Secrecy partners, Roger Bechirian and Andrew Howell.  Cover versions of Marsh's music  * Soul singer Jimmy Ruffin covered \\"Easy to Say I Love You\\", written by Marsh with Marshall and McKenna, in 1989 on PWL Records. * Disco singer Hazell Dean covered Marsh's song (co- written with Bill Clift) \\"In Harmony\\", which was produced by Stock Aitken Waterman in 1988.  Engineer/producer (London)  During the 1990s, Marsh built a recording studio in Greenwich, London, which was used primarily by other musicians. Marsh wrote and produced an album during this time, which was never released. The band gigged occasionally in London and Marsh also worked as an engineer / producer.  The Peter Marsh (all-French band)  In 2006, Marsh moved to France and worked briefly with American jazz musician Tomko. Marsh formed the all-French band, The Peter Marsh, which toured throughout France. Band members included Chateauroux music professor Pascal Freslon (best known as Calhoun), Jean Charles Bavouzet and jazz violinist Caroline Bugala. Marsh built a studio in France, close to Chateauroux.  Solo albums  Marsh released the album Stop the Clock in 2013. A number of songs from the album were featured in the Hong Kong hit TV series Triumph in the Skies. A compilation album, Fly with Love, featured eleven Peter Marsh songs and was released on the Universal Music label. Marsh co-wrote most of the tracks with Pascal Fresion (Calhoun). The album was recorded at Marsh's studio near Chateauroux, in France. Marsh engineered and produced the entire album. All instruments were played by Marsh or Freslon with all vocals by Marsh. In 2017, Marsh released the album Back to the Beginning. The album was notable for a renewed collaboration with Roger Bechirian (as producer). It also featured a number of songs co-written with Pascal Freslon (Calhoun).

It was established by Carlist workers, and remained active during the early interwar period (the late stages of Restoration Spain) as a counterweight to the anarcho-syndicalist Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo. The group aided employers take action against striking unionists, and was thus criticized as a \\"yellow union\\" with proto-fascist leanings; however, its regular members were in practice freely moving between right- and left-wing unionism. The Sindicatos lost momentum during the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, and eventually dissolved when the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed.  History  They Sindicatos Libres were founded on 10 October 1919 in Barcelona, during a time of severe and violent class conflict between employers and workers in the city, with the practice of \\"pistolerismo\\" widespread. With employers feeling that the Spanish Police and Army were inefficient in their attempts to stop left-wing agitation, they sponsored the growth of the Sindicatos, seeking to use them as violent militia groups. Formed by highly conservative Catholic workers, they took on some of the features of a yellow union as employer subsidies to the groups grew. Vilified by anarcho-syndicalist rivals as strikebreaking thugs, the Sindicatos Libres sided with the Spanish Police in the 1920‚àí1922 period, when Civil Governor Severiano Mart√≠nez Anido and Chief of Police Miguel Arlegui unleashed a campaign of state terror against trade unionists. Aside from a small Carlist core, their militancy was not particularly ideological, with members often returning to the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo. They reached 150,000 members in the 1920‚Äì21 period. However, as strike action declined in 1921 and beyond so too did the influence of the Sindicatos Libres as their violent activity became of less value to the employers. During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923‚Äì30), Sindicatos expanded outside of Barcelona; towards the end of the 1920s their membership stood at around 200,000. However, Primo de Rivera's laws against the anarcho-syndicalists and other leftist groups again meant that the group were less essential for the street battles than they had been. The group initially espoused a sort of heterodox Carlism with potentially revolutionary undertones, but as they progressively lost the traditionalist tenets of Carlism, Colin M. Winston argues that they evolved into a first strand of Spanish fascism. The Confederaci√≥n Nacional de Sindicatos Libres (\\"National Confederation of Free Trade Unions\\") dissolved right after the proclamation of the Second Republic in 1931.

Corporate currency analytics help companies manage currency risk in both areas.  Balance sheet risk  Currency Exposure Lifecycle In the process of remeasuring transaction currency monetary assets and liability account balances, the difference between the exchange rate when the transaction was posted and exchange rate when the transaction was cleared goes to the functional entity's income statement as an FX gain or loss. Then in the process of translating the functional entity's income statement for the reporting entity's consolidated income statement, that FX gain/loss gets translated at current income statement rate to reporting currency and appears on the consolidated income statement. Managing balance sheet risk can involve organic (natural) hedging such as using cash positions or intercompany loans to create exposure offsets. It can also involve external hedging such as buying a forward contract to offset FX exposure. In both cases, efficient hedging depends on being able to drill down into the balance sheet to see the currencies of the transactions sitting on the company's books around the world. Currency analytics automates that drill-down process and presents balance sheet exposure data in an easy-to-use dashboard that allows companies to efficiently manage balance sheet risk and minimize FX gain/loss.JPMorgan Chase, ‚ÄúForeign exchange risk management.‚Äù https://www.chase.com/content/dam/chasecom/en/commercial- bank/documents/foreign-exchange-risk-management.pdf  Cash flow risk  In the process of translating the functional entity's income statement, revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and operating expenses (OpEx) get translated at the current income statement rate to reporting currency and appear on the consolidated income statement. Currency impact to revenue, COGS, and OpEx arises from differences between the current income statement rate and the forecasted rate. Managing cash flow risk is fundamentally about protecting the economic value of the company's future flow of cash from being eroded by currency volatility. It can involve organic (natural) hedging such as pricing contracts in a particular currency. It can also involve external hedging, but accounting rules require matching hedges to forecasted cash flows and don't allow hedging economic risk.Treasury & Risk, ‚ÄúCash Flow Hedging Best Practices,‚Äù 28 Jan 2014. http://www.treasuryandrisk.com/2014/01/28/cash-flow- hedging-best-practices?t=treasury-managem Currency analytics allow companies to mitigate cash flow risk by uncovering accounting exposures to match the economic exposures so the company can hedge the accounting exposure as a proxy. Currency analytics enable what/if scenario analysis so companies can model how volatility in particular currencies could impact their revenue and expenses in the future.

He has been assigned for the next four years to the Alabama West-Florida Conference. Dismissal of complaint against Jeff Sessions On June 18, 2018, over 600 members of the United Methodist Church issued a formal complaint to the church, accusing fellow member Jeff Sessions of racial discrimination, child abuse, and spreading \\"doctrines contrary to the standards of doctrine of the United Methodist Church.\\" As Attorney General in the Trump administration, Sessions was overseeing the administration's policy of family separation at the border. Sessions had defended this policy and used the Bible to justify his actions, which the complaint argued was both contrary to the values espoused by the UMC and against the church's Book of Discipline.Members of Jeff Sessions‚Äôs own denomination accuse him of immorality, discrimination and ‚Äòchild abuse‚Äô from The Washington Post On June 14, Sessions had cited Romans 13, which reminds readers that Christians should also follow secular law, to justify his actions and the administration's policy. Many biblical scholars and fellow Methodists harshly criticized Sessions for his interpretation of the text, with one scholar calling it cherry picking because Sessions at the same time ignored Bible passages that called for people to defend children.Sessions‚Äôs Use of Bible Passage to Defend Immigration Policy Draws Fire from The New York Times The family separation policy has faced bipartisan criticism in Congress, and the Trump administration received a federal court order to reunite children separated from their parents. Rev. Debora Bishop, who is district superintendent of the church's Alabama-West Florida Conference (in which Sessions' home church is located), dismissed the complaint on July 30, writing that a government official's actions in their official capacity are separate from their actions as a private person. The Conference's resident bishop David Graves agreed with Rev. Bishop's opinion, arguing that \\"political action is not personal conduct when the political officer is carrying out official policy\\". He also said that because Sessions is a layperson his actions aren't \\"covered by the chargeable offense provisions of The Book of Discipline.\\"A Statement from Bishop David Graves from the Alabama-West Florida Conference of the United Methodist ChurchJeff Sessions cleared in church complaint, perplexing some top Methodists from National Catholic Reporter Seemingly against his earlier decision on Sessions, Graves and many other United Methodist bishops has issued statements calling for the reunification of families.

Officially called Air Albania Stadium for sponsorship reasons. The stadium has a seating capacity of 22,500 constituting the largest stadium in Albania. The stadium is owned by the governing body of Albanian football, the Albanian Football Association (FSHF) and the Albanian State through Shoq√´ria Sportive Kuq e Zi Sh.A, a subsidiary established for the purpose of building, managing and maintaining the structure. Designed by Marco Casamonti of Archea Associati, the structure of the stadium is a peculiar multi-faceted form (an 8-faceted rectangle) so that each side allows access to distinct functions. At one corner of the stadium structure is an 112-meter tall tower (24 floors), which today is the tallest tower in Albania. Each facet accommodates different streams, thus identifying users of private areas, such as the hotel tower, shopping areas and stadium spectators. Location The stadium is located in the city-centre of the capital city of Tirana. Precisely on the Italia Square which itself is alongside one of the two main squares of the city, the Mother Teresa Square, named after the Albanian-born Saint Teresa of Calcutta. Both squares are located at the southern end of the D√´shmor√´t e Kombit Boulevard, which on that side is confined to the University of Tirana building and the Grand Park of the city. The whole area, including the old Qemal Stafa Stadium, was conceived and built during the Kingdom of Albania and later during the Italian occupation by architects and urban planners Gherardo Bosio, Armando Brasini and Florestano Di Fausto. The stadium is surrounded by other public buildings such as the University of Tirana, the Palace of Congress, the Archaeological Museum, University of Arts, the Presidential palace, etc. History =Planning and attempts= For more than 60 years since its construction, Qemal Stafa Stadium served as the main stadium in Albania, the home of the Albanian national team, as well as the home of several athletic competitions and other events. After its degradation over the years, around 2010s the Albanian Football Association (FSHF) and the Albanian government began to discuss the possibility of renovating the facility or, if not possible, building a new stadium in the same location. The government and the FSHF came to an agreement to create a joint venture that would handle the tendering, construction and then management of the new stadium, with the condition that the destination of the sports facility would not be changed. Thus, on 26 March 2011, was established Q√´ndra Sportive Kuq e Zi Sh.A with 70% of shareholding belonging to the FSHF and 25% to the Albanian Government through the Ministry of Sports. On 19 October 2010, Albania's PM Sali Berisha after a meeting with the President of UEFA Michel Platini, declared that the government is seriously considering the construction of a new stadium. Soon after, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers on 2 February 2011, a decision was taken that for the 100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania, which will occur in 2012, a new national stadium will be built in Tirana. Fenwick Iribarren Architects was commissioned to design the new stadium. The project envisioned the construction of a 33,000 all- seated stadium with an exterior facade representing Albanian state borders and its flag colors. But it never went ahead with the implementation of the project, considering it too expensive for the state budget which would cover most of the construction costs. In November 2013 the President of the FSHF, Armand Duka stated that UEFA will no longer allow European competitions such as the Champions League, UEFA Europa League and other international leagues to be played at Qemal Stafa Stadium or any other stadium in Albania because neither of them does not meet UEFA standards. Consequently, the Albanian national team and the Albanian Superliga teams participating in international competitions risked playing their matches abroad. Soon after, FSHF in cooperation with the new government elected, took steps to finance the reconstruction of the Elbasan Arena stadium to avoid UEFA's penalties, thus giving time for the construction of a new national stadium in Tirana. Efforts were made again in 2015, but this time trying new forms of financing without burdening the state budget. The Italian company Serenissima Costruzioni in collaboration with MANICA Architecture and Progetto CMR as designer, presented its project for the stadium. The project envisioned the transfer of ownership of all non-sports and commercial spaces in favor of the company, as well as the construction of a tower on one side of the stadium which would also be owned by the company. This attempt also failed during negotiations between the government and the investor because the company requested the government to provide bank guarantees for the loans that the company would obtain during construction. On 22 May 2016 after the stadium was previously excluded from UEFA due to non-compliance with the standards, the last match between FK Kuk√´si and KF La√ßi valid for the Albanian Cup Final was played in the Qemal Stafa Stadium before its final closure until the new stadium begins to build. =Final effort and Tendering= A final attempt was made the following month by reopening the invitation to tender, with AlbStar Sh.p.k presenting a concrete offer. Compared to previous projects, AlbStar presented a new project with a reduced capacity of 22.500 all-seated stadium which also envisioned a tower in one corner of the stadium structure. The project was designed by Florentine architect Marco Casamonti of Archea Associati, who envisioned an 8-faced rectangular stadium bound by a curved line. Such a form of the stadium was associated with the symbolism of the map of Albania which has a similar rectangular shape from north to south with some curved incisions at the northeast, northwest, southeast and southwestern extremes of the country. The external facade is covered with black and red metal panels combining them with the use of glass on the whole facade, including the tower. The metal panels have a curved triangular form, stylised with some shapes reminiscent of traditional Albanian carpets. The tower itself is 112 meters high and it fits the curved line of the structure on that side. The sports spaces inside the stadium consists of 3 uniform two-ring grandstands, and the main grandstand of one level which serves only for VIP stands. =Demolition and Construction= Air Albania Stadium during construction On 21 April 2016, the project was officially presented by the President of FSHF Armand Duka, accompanied by the PM Edi Rama. At the design stage and during its presentation, the project was renamed \\"Arena Komb√´tare\\" (), thus becoming the common name and widely used throughout its construction. The preliminary cost of the construction was initially said to be around EUR 50 million but later was increased to 60m, and according to comments from FSHF officials, the final cost exceeded 75 million euros. The signed contract stipulates that most of the cost of construction will be carried out by the private company itself, somewhere around EUR 40 million, and the difference of EUR 10 million would be covered by UEFA‚Äôs HatTrick assistance programme. Also, any cost increases during construction would also be carried by the company. While the company would be rewarded with the ownership of all non-sporting parts and the tower which will be built simultaneously on one corner of the structure, as well as exempting the company from VAT payments for any work done related to the project. On the other hand, any other cost for everything sports spaces or game-related spaces will be carried out by the federation itself in cooperation with the government. The FSHF will pay for the interior design of the sports spaces, such as the changing rooms, conference rooms, etc. Also for the natural grass for the pitch, all the seats, the LED floodlights, as well as a large screen also in LED to be installed on the roof of the main grandstand. On 9 June 2016, the demolition of the National Stadium Qemal Stafa has officially begun. A new stadium, the Arena Komb√´tare, will be built in its place, which will serve as the new home of the Albanian national football team. The stadium will have 22,500 seats, but the facility is projected to be multi-functional. Simultaneously with the demolition began the disassembling stone by stone of the monumental staircase built by Gherardo Bosio in 1939, which is considered Monument of Culture and part of the cultural heritage of the capital. It will be conserved and then integrated by reassembled in the same location into the new stadium, where it will serve the same function as the main entrance to the stadium as it has had since its construction. Initially it was said that at least the sports areas of the stadium would be completed within two years of the start of construction, otherwise there would be penalties for the company. But since the beginning of the works there were problems with the sewage system of the capital which passed just under the old stadium, which caused the work to be delayed until the solution was found in cooperation with the Municipality. Then there were some other postponements making the stadium finally wrap up on 10 November 2019, waiting for the first time a test match between women's football teams of KF Vllaznia and KF Apolonia. =Opening= Air Albania Stadium during inauguration match between Albania v. France The FSHF initially announced that the stadium would most likely be inaugurated on 11 June 2019 but had to be tested and inspected by UEFA officials beforehand. However, the plan for the inauguration was postponed due to the delay in work and the pitch just being installed. The first test match was originally set to be played on 3 November, but was delayed by a week due to heavy rains. The first match, a women's fixture between KF Vllaznia and KF Apollonia held on 10 November, was attended by many fans and won by Vllaznia 2‚Äì0, with the first- ever goal at the stadium scored by Arbiona Bajraktari. Arena Komb√´tare, now under the new official name of Air Albania Stadium, was officially inaugurated with a ceremony on 17 November 2019, 1274 days after the final game at the old stadium. The first match, was valid for the Euro 2020 qualifiers played at 20:45 between the national teams of Albanian and France, which the host team lost 0‚Äì2. A crowd of more 21,000 was in attendance. Many celebrities of sport, politics and art were invited to the ceremony, with the UEFA President Aleksander ƒåeferin and Prime Minister of Albania Edi Rama were among them. =Naming= Since 1946, the time at which the stadium was finished, was named Qemal Stafa Stadium in honour of Qemal Stafa, a hero of the second world war and founder of the Communist Party, which was in power after the war. The old stadium held this name until 9 June 2016, the day on which its demolition officially began. During a ceremony held to present the winning project and the conclusion of the agreement for the construction of the new stadium, Albania's PM Edi Rama referred to the new stadium with the name of Arena Komb√´tare. This made the stadium widely known and referred to as \\"Arena Komb√´tare\\" from the day the works began until a few weeks before the completion of the work. However, much controversy arose during the construction of whether the stadium should retain its old name \\"Qemal Stafa\\", the new one \\"Arena Komb√´tare\\" or should be renamed in honour of a prominent Albanian football player to honor him as well as the history of this sport in the country. The most discussed figure was that of Panajot Pano, the former striker of KF Partizani, one of the capital's teams, as well as the national football team player. His name is widely respected and is considered one of the greatest footballers the country has ever known. Towards the end of the works, however, the FSHF hinted that the stadium could be named after a private company for sponsorship reasons. According to the federation, such a stadium will require ongoing funding due to maintenance and this necessitates taking advantage of any sponsorship opportunities. This led to the opening of the tender on 8 August 2019, just months before the inauguration, for the new stadium name. Some domestic and foreign companies were interested in the competition, including oil, telecommunications, insurance, and airline companies. On 15 November 2019, Kuq e Zi Sh.A issued a press release announcing that two companies, Bolv Oil and Air Albania, went in the final phase of negotiations. With the Air Albania being announced as the winner with the most favourable bid. The deal stipulates that within the next five years starting from the date of signing, the new stadium name will be \\"Air Albania Stadium\\". It was also decided that each tribune would have its own name. * Main Stand to be named - Qemal Stafa Stand, in honour of the hero as well as the demolished stadium which was in the same location. * East Stand to be named - Panajot Pano Stand, in honour of former KF Partizani player. * North Stand to be named - Fatmir Frash√´ri Stand, in honour of former KF Tirana player. * South Stand to be named - Vasillaq Z√´ri Stand, in honour of former FK Dinamo player. Structure and facilities =Tirana Marriott Hotel and Arena Center= The stadium is located near the center of the capital Tirana. The building built on the side of the stadium will host Tirana Marriott Hotel. The project includes a history museum, changing rooms, and other facilities such as cafeterias, restrooms including access for the handicapped, a press area, a convention centre, a trophy room, etc. There is no room for a running track as capacity will grow to over 22,000 seats, all covered. The overall project is part of the Arena Shopping Centre together with the 112-meter tower, 80-room hotel and 256 underground parking spaces. All of the stadium facilities will be hidden behind a unique set of blinders in national colours of Albania.

It can simulate multiple interactions among a single ion pair, such as vector meson photoproduction accompanied by mutual Coulomb excitation. These reactions are currently the primary method of studying photo-nuclear and two-photon interactions. History STARlight was initially written in the late 1990s, in FORTRAN.J. Nystrand and S.

STARlight is designed to handle complex reactions involving multiple photon exchange between a single ion pair. These reactions are important at heavy ion colliders, because, with the large nuclear charges, the probability of multi-photon interactions in near grazing collisions (impact parameter b just slightly above twice the nuclear radius) is large.

The latter reaction is important because it shows that there are no large higher order corrections, as could be expected because of the large nuclear charge.

In addition, it provides pocket money to all Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli jails for ordinary crimes. The Fund traces its origins to a fund created by Fatah in 1964 to support the widows and orphans of Palestinian fedayeen. The scheme has been described as \\"pay for slay\\", and has been criticised by some as encouraging terrorism. In 2016, the PA paid out about NIS 1.1 billion (US$303 million) in stipends and other benefits to the families of so-called ‚Äúmartyrs‚Äù. In 2010 (or 2014), the mounting criticism of the payments led to the PA transferring management of the Martyrs Fund to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which now disburses the government-funding to recipients and their families. History The Palestine Mujahidin and Martyrs Fund was established in 1964 by Fatah to recompense the families of dead and wounded militants. In 1971 it was replaced by the Society for the Care of Palestinian Martyrs and Prisoners. The Society defined as \\"military martyrs\\" not only as Palestinian fedayeen killed during terrorist operations but to include fedayeen who died of natural causes while on active service. Their families received cash stipends. Non-members of the Palestine Liberation Organization killed during any kind of encounter with Israeli security forces were given a one-time payment; this created an incentive for families to apply posthumously to have their dead relatives reclassified as fighters. SAMED, the Palestine Martyrs Works Society, was founded in 1970, and handled some of the martyr payments and provided employment in the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in the 1970s. The payments were routinized during the Second Intifada (2000‚Äì2005). In 2016, payments were made to 35,000 families, including the families of suicide bombers, from a 2016 annual budget of $170 million. The stipend is higher than the average Palestinian wage. The question of whether militants from all political factions will receive such payments from the PA has been highly contested within Palestinian society, with President Mahmoud Abbas withdrawing, then in 2009 restoring, such payments for prisoners belonging to the PLO, but the government claims that it does not make such payments to families of prisoners belonging to Hamas or Islamic Jihad. In July 2018, Australia ended direct aid to the PA through the World Bank, amid growing concerns that Australia's tax dollars may be helping to fund terrorism. =Names= The fund is often referred to as the Martyrs Fund, and, pejoratively, as \\"Pay for Slay.\\" A series of funding agencies have existed over the decades, including \\"Fund for Families of Martyrs and the Injured.\\" Benefits paid The funding system pays regular stipends to imprisoned individuals and to the surviving families of deceased individuals. The agencies that disburse the funds employ over 500 bureaucrats. Funds are dispersed via separate agencies, one for families of prisoners and the other for the general population. Both agencies are \\"PLO institutions,\\" but they are both funded by the PA. According to a report by Yossi Kuperwasser, of the Israeli advocacy group Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, in 2017 half of the $693 million that the PA receives as foreign aid, $345 million, was paid out as stipends to convicted terrorists and their families. Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, repeated this claim in a speech to AIPAC in 2018. According to the Washington Post's fact-checking, the $350 million figure requires a broad brush classifying all recipients as terrorists; and the picture regarding funding is considered fuzzy because Palestinian budget lines combine terrorist and non-terrorist funding and primarily since the definition of a terrorist is disputed. Does the Palestinian Authority pay $350 million a year to ‚Äòterrorists and their families‚Äô?, Washington Post, Glenn Kessler The Washington Post's analysis showed that in 2017, $160 million was paid to 13,000 beneficiaries of ‚Äúprisoner payments‚Äù ($12,307 per person) and $183 million was paid to 33,700 families in about in ‚Äúmartyr payments‚Äù ($5,430 per family), of which: *$36 million is estimated to be paid to prisoners serving sentences of >20 years *$10 million is paid to former members of the security forces *$1 million is estimated to be paid to families of the 200 suicide bombers *$10 million is paid to the families of the Palestinians with life terms, lengthy sentences and in the security forces =Prisoner fund= Under the Amended Palestinian Prisoners Law No. 19 (2004), prisoners who have served a year or more in Israeli prison are entitled upon release to health insurance and tuition-free school, university and professional education. If they become civil servants, the law stipulates that the Palestinian Authority will \\"pay his social security and pension fees . . . for the years he spent in prison.‚Äù Incarcerated individuals are entitled to monthly stipends \\"linked to the cost-of-living index.\\" The 2013 amendments to the law entitle individuals released from prison a preference in getting jobs with the Palestinian Authority, and stipulates that the PA \\"will make up the difference\\" if the civil service salary \\"is lower than the salary he received in prison.\\" Females who have served 2 years in prison, and males who have served 5 are entitled to receive stipends for the rest of their lives. =Foundation for the Care of the Families of Martyrs= The Foundation is dedicated to assisting an Arab who has been \\"wounded, killed, or otherwise affected as a result of their joining the revolution or the presence of the revolution\\" against Israel and operates within the PA's Ministry of Social Affairs. In 2016 it supported 35,100 families. Countering Palestinian Authority claims that this is a welfare fund, the World Bank has stated that, \\"the program is clearly not targeted to the poorest households. While some assistance should be directed to this population, the level of resources devoted to the Fund for Martyrs and the Injured does not seem justified from welfare or fiscal perspective.\\" =Stipends= Stipends are paid to families of both prisoners and Palestinians killed in contexts ranging from political demonstrations that turn violent where protesters are killed by non-lethal riot control methods (such as being hit by a tear gas canister) and to individuals imprisoned for \\"common crimes\\". The fund also pays $106 a month in \\"canteen money\\" to all imprisoned Palestinians, including those imprisoned for non-political crimes such as car theft and drug dealing, for prisoners to spend in the prison canteen. Families of individuals killed by Israeli security forces are paid stipends of about $800 to $1,000 per month. The families of convicted Palestinians serving time in Israeli prisons receive $3,000 or higher per month. Douglas J. Feith calls the stipends \\"cash incentives\\" to spur Arabs to undertake car ramming and stabbing as a terrorist tactic. Salam Fayyad, a former PA Prime Minister and Finance Minister, stated that between January 1995 and June 2002 the fund distributed NIS 16 million to families of prisoners annually, and between June 2002 to June 2004 NIS 88.5 million annually. In 2017 the National Association of the Martyrs‚Äô Families of Palestine demanded cost of living increases in their stipends, which had been unchanged since 2011. Private charities including the U.S. based Holyland Foundation have been accused of funding the stipends. Hamas Hamas has operated a separate Martyrs Fund since well before the 2007 insurgent coup d'etat resulting in the Hamas' takeover of Gaza. In 2001, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas, boasted that Hamas payments to the families of prisoners and of suicide bombers totalled between $2 and $3 million. But according to a 2001 Israeli government report, the families of prisoners received an initial lump sum payment of $500 ‚Äì $5,000, with monthly stipends of about $100, with higher payments for the families of Hamas members. The Hamas-controlled Unlimited Friends Association for Social Development (UFA) in Gaza is supported by eight registered U.S. charities. By its own account, UFA distributes cash both to the needy and to \\"the families of martyrs and prisoners,\\" and \\"families of martyrs of the Palestinian people\\". Attitude of Palestinian society The \\"martyr\\" payments are \\"exceedingly popular\\" among Palestinians and have been described as \\"part of the ethos of Palestinian society.\\" Ziad Asali, founding president of the American Task Force on Palestine, told a reporter that Palestinian politicians and the media have elevated these payments to the point where they are \\"sacred in Palestinian politics,\\" and no government dares terminate the practice. Professor Nathan Brown of George Washington University says that the stipends to prisoner's families are \\"universally supported among Palestinians.\\" The Palestinian Prisoners' Club defends the stipends; the Club's leader, Qadura Fares, maintains that payments supporting the families of prisoners are just because the families, \\"are a part of our people\\" and that \\"the family did nothing against anyone.\\" According to Fares, the attacks for which the prisoners were convicted are \\"not terror,\\" but \\"part of the struggle\\" against Israel. In June 2017, PA President Mahmoud Abbas called efforts to stop the martyr payments an \\"aggression against the Palestinian people,\\" and defended the salaries paid to imprisoned Palestinians as a \\"social responsibility.\\" A public opinion poll commissioned by The Washington Institute for Near East Policy in June 2017 showed that two-thirds of Palestinians polled disagreed with the PA's policy, saying that Palestinian prisoners and their families do not deserve extra payments on account of their \\"armed operations\\", but should instead be given regular social benefits like other Palestinians. Response by governments =Australia= In July 2018, Australia stopped the A$10 million (US$7.5 million) in funding that had been sent to the PA via the World Bank and instead is sending it to the UN Humanitarian Fund for the Palestinian Territories. The reason given was that they did not want the PA to use the funds to assist Palestinians convicted of politically motivated violence. =Israel= Prime Minister Netanyahu called the payments \\"an incentive for murder\\". The Israeli government, describing the payments as glorifying terrorism, responded to the June 2016 murder of Hallel Yaffa Ariel by threatening to deduct the value of \\"martyr\\" payments from the tax revenue it pays to the PA. Speaking before the United Nations Security Council on 24 June 2017, Israeli ambassador Danny Danon, together with Oran Almog, one of the victims of the Maxim restaurant suicide bombing, demanded that the PA cease incentivizing terrorism by paying stipends to terrorists.Halamish Terrorist Will Receive Monthly Salary from Palestinian Authority, Jewish Press, 24 July 2017Danon shows photos from Halamish terror attack at UN, YNET, Itamar Eichner, 24 July 2017 In July 2018, the Knesset passed a law for Israel to deduct the amount of money that the PA gives to terrorists and their families from the taxes and tariffs Israel collects for the PA. =Germany= Germany is reviewing the payment of foreign aid to the PA in the light of the use of these funds to incentivize terrorism. =Norway= In 2016, B√∏rge Brende, Foreign Minister of Norway, demanded that the PA cease using Norwegian foreign aid for \\"martyr\\" stipends. He was satisfied with an assurance that Norwegian funds would not be used for the stipends, although the change was purely \\"cosmetic\\" since PA funds are fungible. =United States= Following the murder of Hallel Yaffa Ariel, a dual Israeli-U.S. national, in June 2016, the United States threatened to deduct the sums paid out to \\"martyrs\\" from the Martyrs Fund from the subsidies it grants to the PA. On 23 March 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Taylor Force Act into law, which will cut about a third of US foreign aid payments to the PA, until the PA ceases making payment of stipends to terrorists and their surviving families.

Their rural Goochland County home lacked both plumbing and central heating. His father died of pneumonia when Harwood was 16 years old, and his mother ran a soup kitchen in Richmond, Virginia. He met his future wife of eight decades, Louise Odell Banks, on a blind date (each with another person) and they wed in the parlor of the pastor of Tabernacle Baptist Church in 1934. His mother fixed their wedding dinner, and their honeymoon was a movie at the Loew's theater in downtown Richmond. Harwood and Louise celebrated their 80th anniversary at the same location, although the location had become the Carpenter Theater, and their 1000 guests listened to Steven Smith conduct the Richmond Symphony Women's Chorus, Richmond Ballet and various soloists.Richmond Times Dispatch obituary at p. A8 Career In 1929, the teenaged Cochrane quit Goochland High School and began delivering milk for the Virginia Dairy Company, Incorporated (1912-1978). He long remembered those years of starting work shortly before 2 a.m. He, his brother Calvin and Charlie the Horse were \\"Cochrane Transportation.\\" The brothers established separate trucking companies in 1933, splitting up routes. In 1935, despite the Great Depression and having married Louise only about a year earlier, Cochrane quit the part-time dairy delivery job and formed Overnite Transportation. The name arose because a Baltimore company already was called \\"Overnight Transportation.\\" Cochrane later told tales of eating frugally on the road, sometimes pawning his watch or other items to buy gasoline to return home, and even for nine months in 1934 driving a truck lacking both brakes and fourth gear. Overnite Trucking nonetheless grew both internally and by acquiring other trucking companies. It relied on establishing a system of terminals to facilitate short-haul deliveries.Automotive hall of fame The development of the Interstate Highway System helped business, and the Interstate Commerce Commission also began regulating the industry in 1935. Overnite Trucking's stock became publicly traded in 1957 despite a bruising unionization effort by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Cochrane later treasured a copy of the $359,000 check written in 1963 by then Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa to Overnite to settle a legal judgment against the Union.Johnathan S. Reiskin, \\"Overnight Transportation Founder J. Harwood Cochrane Dies at 103,\\" Transport Topics July 26, 2016, available at http://ttnews.com/articles/basetemplate.aspx?storyid=42688 By 1986, the company which began with a tractor, a trailer, a straight truck and two part- time drivers had become large enough that the Union Pacific Corporation offered to buy it. Though Cochrane initially demurred, he finally sold it for $1.2 billion. Many of his employees, who had received stock, also became wealthy. Cochrane remained as Overnite's CEO until 1991 (at age 79 and when a 5-year non-competition agreement expired). Union Pacific spun Overnite off in 2003, and in 2005 United Parcel Service bought it for $1.25 billion.

He sold Highway Express in 2003 to the Celadon Group and with his wife Louise concentrated on philanthropic activities.Richmond Times Dispatch, July 27, 2016 at pp. A1, A8 They become major philanthropists of their home town.

They also made donations to their Tabernacle Baptist Churchhttp://tbcrichmond.org/tbc/ and numerous Baptist causes, including the Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond (which gave them both honorary degrees in 2012), well-digging efforts in Africa and $8 million to the Southern Baptist International Mission Board (although Cochrane) ended up writing it out of his will, displeased with increasing fundamentalism).https://baptistnews.com/article/j-harwood-cochrane- benefactor-to-baptist-causes-dies- at-103/https://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/the-power-list/Content?oid=1363263 Death and legacy Cochrane died within a year of his beloved wife of 81 years, Louise.

The episode was written by series creators Jim Kouf and David Greenwalt from a story by Kouf, and was directed by Karen Gaviola. Plot Opening quote: \\"Oh! There is a terrible witch in that house who spewed her poison over me and scratched me with her long fingernails.\\" Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) sees Renard (Sasha Roiz) and Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) kissing. When Juliette sees him, she leaves. Two Hundj√§gers from the Verrat in motorcycles watch them and report it to Adalind (Claire Coffee), who has returned from Vienna. Monroe tells Nick (David Giuntoli) that Juliette kissed a man but as he doesn't know Renard, he can't identify him. Nick confronts Juliette with this, but she states that nothing else happened between her and Renard. Hank (Russell Hornsby) is then visited by Adalind and after turning her down is attacked by two Hundj√§gers and sent to the hospital. He tells Nick of Adalind and that she wants to know who killed her mother. Adalind calls Renard to inform him that she now is affiliated with the Verrat and demands that he give her the key or she will tell Nick about Renard's real identity. Adalind visits Juliette and they go to a coffee shop to talk about Nick and to find the location of the trailer. Nick calls Juliette and discovers she is with Adalind and sends a group of police officers to arrest her under the suspicion of killing her mother, upsetting Juliette that Nick used her. In fact, Adalind planned on getting arrested, insisting it is \\"safer\\". Adalind gives her hotel room address and Monroe \\"accidentally\\" sneaks into the room to find out who else is there, and finds four Hundj√§gers of the Verrat inside. He lures them to a field where Nick uses a Kanabo (a resemblance of a bat) to kill two of them and demands a girl to reveal their boss in Portland but she is killed by the last Hundj√§ger. Nick and Monroe dispose of the evidence in an attempt to clear themselves. Nick confronts Adalind and she states that he will get the name of the boss if he turns over the key. Unable to live with Juliette, Nick moves in with Monroe where Monroe tells him that he saw the person who was making out with Juliette in a television report. Nick is shocked when he discovers the man is Renard. Meanwhile, Renard has discovered the location of the trailer, looking for the key.

The A.V. Club's Les Chappell gave the episode a \\"A\\" grade and wrote, \\"That all changes in 'Season Of The Hexenbiest' however, an outing that's firmly grounded in the larger world of the show. It presents the return of the mysterious key that Nick's mother promised was part of a larger puzzle dating back to the Crusades, the Verrat's merciless Hundj√§ger enforcers and the most direct involvement by the Seven Houses in Portland events to date. And perhaps not coincidentally, it also happens to be the best episode the show's done all season ('La Llorona' being a close second), an episode that uses this larger world as an impetus to push several characters out of their holding patterns, where things are said and seen which no one can take back.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.8 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"'Season of the Hexenbiest' finally brought Nick's line of focus to the man just below his Grimm world: Renard. Of course, this is still Grimm we're talking about, and Nick is still in the dark when it comes Renard's royal blood. But Nick won't let up until he knows exactly what kind of man Renard is because Renard is the person Nick can place blame on for his continually caving personal life.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"We pick up with where we ended the last episode of Grimm: Renard and Juliette locking lips in the spice shop, but once she sees Monroe, she hightails it to her car and heads home. In addition to her vehicle and Renard's vehicle, both on the road and going different directions, we see two black-clad figures on motorcycles, each with double diamond symbols on their hands. They work for Adalind Schade, the (former?) Hexenbiest that has been a thorn in Nick's paw since the third episode of the series; she had them, a brunette female and a blonde-ish male with longer hair, stalking the Captain in order to gather information on his obsession with Juliette.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"'Season of the Hexenbiest' was so much better then the last handful of filler episodes, in fact, that I wonder if Grimm is a show that could benefit from a shorter, cable-style season, focusing on a fast-paced and twisty 13 episodes rather than a slow and drawn-out 22 or 24. I, for one, would be willing to sacrifice some of the episodic Wesen-of-the-Week plots to focus more on the Royals vs. the Grimms.\\" References External links Grimm (season 2) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"Season of the Hexenbiest"},{"id":"51164226","text":"UACV may stand for: * Unmanned aerial combat vehicle: see Unmanned combat aerial vehicle * Unpasteurized apple cider vinegar or unfiltered apple cider vinegar: see Apple cider vinegar ","title":"UACV"},{"id":"51164234","text":"The African Qualifiers for the 1968 Summer Olympics football tournament began in April 1967 and ended in June 1968.http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/ol1968q.html#Africa Group 1 =First round= } Libya advance.

The system is administered by the city and is owned and operated by CycleHop. The system launched on July 20, 2016, with a limited number of stations and bicycles for founding members. For sponsorship reasons, the service is also known as Mobi by Shaw Go. History A public bike share system for Vancouver was first proposed in 2008 through a feasibility study by TransLink. The following year, the Vancouver City Council directed staff to begin searching for an operator, with Alta Bicycle Share selected as the preferred operator in 2011. A five-year, $6 million contract was signed by the city with Alta in July 2013, aiming for a spring 2014 launch for a system with 1,500 bicycles. The bankruptcy of bike-share system supplier Bixi in early 2014 pushed back the launch date, and the sale of Alta Bike Share to Motivate in October prompted the city to look for a new service provider the following year. In February 2016, the City of Vancouver signed a five-year, $5 million agreement with CycleHop to operate a bike sharing system in the city by the end of the year. A soft launch for founding members was held on July 20, 2016, with 260 bicycles and 23 stations open in Downtown Vancouver and part of the Fairview neighborhood, bounded by Arbutus Street to the west, 16th Avenue to the south, and Main Street to the east. By the end of the summer, the entire initial phase of 1,500 bicycles and 150 stations is expected to open. On December 6, 2016, Mobi announced a corporate sponsorship with Shaw Communications, a Canadian telecommunications company. The sponsorship renamed the service to \\"Mobi by Shaw Go\\" and added Shaw branding to bicycles and stations, the latter of which would also receive free Wi-Fi. , the system had 1,200 bikes and 122 stations. , the system had 1,400 bikes and 143 stations. In June 2018, the coverage area was extended east to Commercial Drive. The minimum age to use Mobi was dropped to 12 years old, although the service only has adult-sized bicycles. Pricing Mobi offers four payment options for its rental service: two annual plans of $129 and $159 for an unlimited number of 30 and 60 minute rides, respectively; a 90 day pass of 75$ and a 24 hours pass of $12 for unlimited 30-minute rides. Overage fees are $6 for each additional 30 minute block on the 24 hour pass and $3 for all subsequent 30 minute blocks of additional riding on the $75 and $129 plan. A surcharge of $3 per half-hour for rides over 60 minutes are charged on the $159 plan. During the soft launch, a \\"founding members\\" discount brought the annual plans down to $99 and $129. Corporate memberships that involve a 25% discount launched in 2017. Equipment Mobi's fleet of 1,500 bicycles and its stations were built by Smoove, a French company that specializes in bike sharing systems. The \\"smart bikes\\" are able to be locked outside of designated stations with a lock and PIN code or digital key fob. The system provides free helmets alongside rented bikes to comply with the province's helmet law.

She obtained her Ph.D from the University of Colorado in 1982, becoming one of the first Saudi women to do so, alongside the likes of Soraya Al-Turki, Soraya Obeid, Fatin Shakir and Samira Islam. Her dissertation title was Economic Development and its Impact on the Status of Women in Saudi Arabia. In 1985, al-Mana established Al-Sharika Al-Khalijiah Lil Inmaa (Al- Khalijiah Development Company,) the first company in Saudi Arabia run completely by women. The company's mission was to offer computer training and technical education to women and to establish a research center with a focus on research on women in the work force. Al-Mana became the first female hospital director in Saudi Arabia in 1990, when she became Director of Support Services at the Almana Group of Hospitals in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Challenging the driving ban Al-Mana participated in three different campaigns to protest the driving ban. The first was in 1990, during the Gulf War, and was documented in the book The Sixth of November. Al-Mana also participated in subsequent campaigns in 2011 and 2013 as part of the Women to Drive movement. Aisha al-Mana was one of forty-six women to organize a demonstration in Riyadh on 6 November 1990 to protest the Kingdom's ban on women driving. Prior to the demonstration, the women had sent a petition to then-Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, the governor of Riyadh at the time, requesting that he and King Fahad move to lift the ban. They drove their cars in a convoy until they were stopped and detained by the police. Al-Mana and several other participants described their experiences in the 2011 book, The Sixth of November. The demonstration was also fictionalized by Saad Al-Dosari in his novel, Riyadh- November 90. Most of the participants received travel bans, and those who had government jobs lost their positions. Years later, al- Mana also participated in two other driving campaigns. The first, inspired by the Arab Spring, took place in 2011, while the other was organized in October 2013. Gender equality activism and educational work In 2011, al-Mana held workshops on the male guardianship system in the cities of Riyadh, Jeddah and Khobar as part of the anti male-guardianship campaign. In 2013, she participated in a symposium titled Women, Commercial Inheritance and Family Rule during which participants called for \\"an independent body of a judicial nature\\" to protect women's inheritance. Saudi women are often pressured by family members, relatives, acquaintances and other members of society to give up any funds they may be entitled to inherit so that the inheritance may be divided up among male next of kin. Al-Mana says that, \\"Denying women their inheritance is one of the main reasons behind family feuds.\\" Al-Mana has established foundations to support the education of Saudi women. The Aisha Almana Global Health Program is a scholarship program at the University of Oregon, where she obtained her bachelor's degree. The program \\"will provide scholarships for Saudi women to study global health at the UO, fund seed grants for faculty research, help implement an annual series of speakers and workshops, and support internships for UO students in the Saudi kingdom ‚Äî the UO‚Äôs first fully funded international internships in global health.\\" The Aisha Al Mana Endowment for Women in Nursing and the Health Sciences supports the education of women studying nursing and the health and medical sciences. Priority is given to Saudi women, but if there are no eligible Saudi women applicants, then women from other Arab countries are considered.

The NJWL was influenced by pre-World War II suffrage organizations and did not mention gender equality or women in the workforce in its founding principles. NJWL and Ichikawa worked to \\"struggle against conservative social taboos.\\" NJWL lobbied the government over laws and policies that were unequal in treatment of men and women. In 1950, New Japan Women‚Äôs League was renamed to the Women's Suffrage League of Japan. Thereafter, Women's Suffrage League of Japan had the basic principles of \\"equality, welfare, political purification, and permanent world peace\\" and promoted movements that connect between women and the Diet.  History of the establishment New Japan Women‚Äôs League  In Japan, voting and joining associations were completely banned for women in 1889 after the establishment of the Constitution of the Japan Empire by the Assembly Regulations and Peace Police Act. In 1905, socialist women started an opposition movement to reform the law and get rid of the ban. Later named the New Women's Association, in 1919 the socialist women‚Äôs organization succeeded in partly revising the Peace Police Act. In 1945, one of the members of New Women's Association, Fusae Ichikawa, established a new organization for women's suffrage movement, called the New Japan Women‚Äôs League. The New Japan Women‚Äôs League temporary declined because Fusae was purged by order of the General Headquarters of the Allied Forces in April 1947, but she was released from the purgeand she came back to the New Japan Women‚Äôs League in October 1950. She renamed to the Women's Suffrage League of Japan in November 1950 and promoted women‚Äôs movements.  Movements  The main movements of New Japan Women‚Äôs League are following: * Abolition movement of legal system against women * Political education movement for exercising of women‚Äôs suffrage more effectively * Establishment of policy related to women‚Äôs life, education, and labor  Achievements  New Japan Women‚Äôs League (NJWL) put a headquarters in Tokyo and opened 35 branches all over Japan. The president of New Japan Women‚Äôs League, Fusae Ichikawa had started a movement that interests a large number of Japanese women in politics and improves their knowledge of politics since November 3, 1945 and gathered about 3000 women to the NJWL. Women in NJWL and Fusae also shaped a plan of women‚Äôs suffrage with the 43rd Prime Minister Higashikuni and politician, Ichiro Hatoyama. The 44th Prime Minister Shidehara adapted women‚Äôs suffrage upon a cabinet decision and Home Minister Zenjiro Horikiri submitted the women suffrage bill of the House of Representative Election Law to the Diet on November 17, 1945. It was passed and women who are over 20 years of age voted for the first time under the Revised Election Law. The president of New Japan Women‚Äôs League, Fusae looked back and says, \\"Without the Occupation or the defeat ofJapan, the realization of the Japanese women's constitutional rights would not have been achieved so quickly.\\" in an interview.

Case The case was argued on October 21, 1913, and decided on December 1, 1913. Stratton's Independence, Limited, a British corporation that owned and operated mines in Colorado, sued in a district court to recover taxes it had paid under protest in accordance with the provisions of the Corporation Tax Act of 1909. During the year 1909, the firm had had gross sales of $284,682.85 and costs of $190,939.42, resulting in a profit of $93,743.43. In 1910, the figures had been similar. =Plaintiff's argument= Stratton's contended that the mining and sale of ore was an essentially different sort of activity than manufacturing, because it involved the depletion and sale of capital, and should therefore not be taxed in the same way, because taxing the sale of ore amounted to taxing capital. =Majority opinion= Justice Pitney, in the majority opinion, stated that the case raised three questions. The first was whether or not the Corporate Tax Act applied to mining corporations. The second question raised was whether or not proceeds from mining activities constituted \\"income\\" by the definition of the act. The final question related to whether or not ore sales were considered income and therefore if the mining corporation could deduct the value of the ore in place before it was mined as depreciation. The court answered the first two questions in the affirmative, but not the third. Mining, Justice Pitney argued, is generally comparable to manufacturing, and is certainly a business; hence, the gains from this activity should be considered income for the purposes of taxation. Chief Justice White, Justice McKenna, and Justice Holmes dissented on the third question. Significance The case represented one of the Supreme Court's early attempts to define the term ‚Äúincome.‚Äù Justice Pitney's description of income as ‚Äúthe gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined‚Äù has been widely quoted, as has his comment that ‚Äúthe corporation tax act of 1909 was not intended to be and is not, in any proper sense, an income tax law.‚Äù The case has been cited (unsuccessfully) in such cases as Hill v. United States and Cameron v. Internal Revenue Service, in support of the argument that a tax on an individual's income is unconstitutional, even though the decision in Stratton did not rule either corporate or individual income tax unconstitutional.

A panel of scientists, along with 7 ex-NFL players presented a case for using CBD products. Cannabis in Texas is illegal for recreational use. Possession of up to two ounces is a class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 180 days in prison, a fine of up to $2000, and the suspension of one's driver's license. Several of the state's major municipalities have enacted reforms to apply lesser penalties, however. Medical use is allowed only in the form of low-THC cannabis oil, less than 0.5% THC with a doctor's approval and less than 0.3% THC without. Legislation allowing for medical use was first approved in 2015. Prior to 1973, Texas had the harshest cannabis laws of any state in the nation, with possession of any amount classified as a felony offense punishable by two years to life in prison. Possession was banned statewide in 1931. History =Early history= John Gregory Bourke described the use of \\"mariguan\\", which he identifies as Cannabis indica or Indian hemp, by Mexican residents of the Rio Grande region of Texas in 1894. He described its uses for treatment of asthma, to expedite delivery, to keep away witches, and as a love-philtre. He also wrote that many Mexicans added the herb to their cigarritos or mescal, often taking a bite of sugar afterward to intensify the effect. Bourke wrote that because it was often used in a mixture with toloachi (which he inaccurately describes as Datura stramonium), mariguan was one of the several plants known as \\"loco weed\\". Bourke compared mariguan to hasheesh, which he called \\"one of the greatest curses of the East\\", citing reports that users \\"become maniacs and are apt to commit all sorts of acts of violence and murder\\", causing degeneration of the body and an idiotic appearance, and mentioned laws against sale of hasheesh \\"in most Eastern countries\\".Bourke cites an anonymous writer in the \\"Evening Star\\", Washington, D. C., January 13, 1894 for additional remarks on the use of mariguan and Jamestown weed by inhabitants of the area. =1915 El Paso ban= The Texas city of El Paso was the first American city to individually restrict cannabis, in 1915. The scene for this city ban was set in 1913, when a man killed a police officer in neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, while chasing an El Paso couple. Chief Deputy Stanley Good of the El Paso Sheriff's Department noted over several media statements: > One under its influence is devoid of fear and as reckless of consequences or > results. There are instances where the drug crazed victim has been placed in > jail, but in many cases officers have been compelled to slay the fiend in > order to save their own lives. ... A large percentage of the crimes > committed are by men saturated with the drug... Most Mexicans in this > section are addicted to the habit, and it is a growing habit among > Americans. =1919 Sale restricted= In 1919, legislation was enacted to prohibit the transfer of narcotics, including cannabis, for non-medical use. Transfer of cannabis in this manner was made a misdemeanor crime; however, possession of the drug still remained legal. =1923 Further restrictions= In 1923, legislation was enacted to prohibit the possession of narcotics, including cannabis, with intent to sell. As a result of this law, cannabis could no longer be purchased over-the-counter at pharmacies (only by prescription). =1931 Prohibition= 2015 Border Patrol seizure of cannabis in the Rio Grande Valley Possession of cannabis was banned statewide in 1931. Until 1973 it would remain classified as a narcotic with the possibility of life sentences imposed for possession of small amounts. Reforms =State level= House Bill 447 (1973) In June 1973, House Bill 447 was signed into law to significantly reduce penalties for cannabis offenses. Prior to its passage Texas had the harshest cannabis laws of any state in the nation, with possession of any amount classified as a felony offense punishable by two years to life in prison. With the passage of the bill, possession of up to two ounces was reduced to a class B misdemeanor, punishable by a $1000 fine and prison sentence of no more than 180 days. The bill passed the Senate by a 24‚Äì7 vote and the House 84‚Äì58. House Bill 447 also contained a provision for persons serving time for cannabis offenses to be resentenced under the new law. The resentencing provision was later ruled to be unconstitutional; however, by May 1974 Gov. Dolph Briscoe had granted clemency to 95 of these prisoners. House Bill 2391 (2007) In June 2007, House Bill 2391 was signed into law by Governor Rick Perry. The law allowed police to \\"cite and release\\" for certain misdemeanor crimes instead of subjecting offenders to immediate arrest (though the same penalties still applied). Among the offenses for which a citation could be issued was possession of up to 4 ounces of cannabis. Many police departments announced they would continue to arrest for minor cannabis offenses, however. Proposed recreational legalization (2015) In 2015 state representative David Simpson introduced House Bill 2165 to legalize the use of cannabis for recreational purposes. A Tea Party- backed conservative, Simpson made a religious case for cannabis, stating: \\"I don't believe that when God made marijuana, he made a mistake that government needs to fix.\\" In May 2015, Simpson's bill gained a majority of support in the House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee, but was not accepted to make it further on the House floor in the limited time remaining in the legislative session. Limited medical use legalized (2015) In June 2015, Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 339 ‚Äì the Texas Compassionate Use Act ‚Äì allowing the use of low-THC (less than 0.5% THC) cannabis oil for treatment of epilepsy patients. Abbott caveated his support: \\"I remain convinced that Texas should not legalize marijuana, nor should Texas open the door for conventional marijuana to be used for medicinal purposes.\\" The bill passed by a 26‚Äì5 vote in the Senate and a 96‚Äì34 vote in the House. House approves reduced penalties (2019) In April 2019, the House of Representatives voted 98‚Äì43 to approve House Bill 63. If enacted, the bill would have made possession of up to one ounce a Class C (rather than a Class B) misdemeanor, eliminated the threat of jail time, and reduced the fine to $500. The day after its passage in the House, however, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick announced that he would not allow a vote on it in the Senate. Hemp legalization (2019) In June 2019 Gov. Abbott signed House Bill 1325 to legalize the cultivation of industrial hemp (cannabis containing less than 0.3% THC). It also legalized possession and sale of hemp-derived CBD products without need for a doctor's approval. The bill passed the Senate 31‚Äì0 and the House 140‚Äì3. The enactment of HB 1325 also caused an outcome that legislators did not intend. Because the bill changed the legal definition of marijuana (from cannabis in general to cannabis containing greater than 0.3% THC), many marijuana possession charges across the state were soon dropped due to a shortage of THC testing equipment available. Prosecutors in the counties of Harris, Tarrant, Bexar, Travis, and several others soon announced the dismissal of hundreds of marijuana cases and a moratorium on pursuing new charges. Qualifying conditions expanded (2019) In June 2019, Gov. Abbott signed House Bill 3703 which increased the number of qualifying conditions eligible for treatment under the state's low-THC medical cannabis program. Previously limited to epilepsy only, the bill added terminal cancer, autism, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), seizure disorders, and incurable neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's Disease. =County and municipal level= El Paso drug legalization resolution (2009) In January 2009, the city council of El Paso voted 8‚Äì0 in favor of a resolution (sponsored by councilman Beto O'Rourke) calling for a national debate regarding the legalization of drugs as a way to reduce drug cartel violence. The resolution was then vetoed by the mayor, however, and an attempt to override the veto one week later failed by a 4‚Äì4 vote. Members of the council had been swayed by pressure from Rep. Silvestre Reyes and several state lawmakers who warned that future allocation of federal funds to the city could be affected. Austin cite-and-release (2009) In February 2009, the Austin Police Department instituted a policy of cite-and-release for possession of small amounts of cannabis. The Travis County Sheriff's Office, which encompasses a large part of the Austin metro area, had already been operating under such a policy since the end of 2007. Harris County First Chance Intervention Program (2014) In October 2014, Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson announced the launch of the First Chance Intervention Program. Under the program, persons possessing less than two ounces of cannabis would still be subject to arrest, but could avoid a criminal conviction by attending drug education classes or performing community service. In January 2016 the program was expanded so that a citation was given instead of arrest, and all law enforcement agencies within the county were required to comply. Harris County Misdemeanor Marijuana Diversion Program (2017) In February 2017, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg announced the launch of the Misdemeanor Marijuana Diversion Program that further expanded upon the reforms of the First Chance Intervention Program. Under the new program, persons possessing less than four ounces of cannabis would not face criminal charges or even be issued a citation as long as they agreed to attend a four-hour drug education class. The new program also differed in that persons who had committed previous cannabis offenses would still be eligible to participate. The program went into effect in March 2017. Dallas cite-and-release (2017) In April 2017 the Dallas City Council voted 10‚Äì5 to adopt a cite- and-release policy for possession of less than 4 ounces of cannabis. In October 2017 county commissioners 4‚Äì1 voted to approve the plan, and it went into effect in December 2017. Bexar County cite-and-release, diversion (2017) In September 2017, Bexar Country District Attorney Nico LaHood announced a new cite-and-release policy for persons caught with less than 4 ounces of cannabis. The program also allowed cited individuals to avoid criminal charges by attending a class, paying a fine, and performing community service. The policy went into effect for the Bexar County Sheriff's Office in January 2018. El Paso County First Chance Program (2017) In October 2017, El Paso County commissioners voted unanimously to allow people caught with less than 4 ounces of cannabis to pay a $100 fine and perform 8 hours of community service in lieu of facing criminal charges. Named the First Chance Program, it only applies to people that are not caught with any other drugs. Travis County diversion program (2017) In December 2017, Travis County commissioners unanimously approved a plan to allow persons cited for less than two ounces of cannabis to take a four-hour educational course (at the cost of $45) rather than being subject to criminal charges. The policy went into effect in January 2018. Dallas County limited enforcement, diversion (2019) In April 2019, Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot announced that individuals caught possessing misdemeanor amounts of cannabis would no longer be prosecuted for first-time offenses. Individuals who commit subsequent offenses would be offered diversionary courses to avoid a criminal conviction. Bexar County expanded cite-and-release, limited enforcement (2019) In May 2019, Bexar County District Attorney Joe Gonzales announced that an expanded version of cite-and-release would be implemented during the summer and apply to San Antonio Police Department as well. Additionally, Gonzales announced that his office would no longer prosecute possession of less than one ounce of cannabis. Austin depenalization (2020) In January 2020, Austin City Council voted 9‚Äì0 in favor of a resolution that effectively eliminates penalties for possessing up to 4 ounces of cannabis and directs the city manager to \\"take the steps necessary and appropriate to eliminate, to the furthest extent allowable under state law ... the use of arrest or other enforcement action for cannabis-related possession offenses\\". In July 2020 Austin Police Department announced that it had revised its enforcement policies to comply with the resolution. El Paso cite-and- release (2020) In May 2020, El Paso City Council voted 7‚Äì0 to adopt a cite-and-release policy for possession of less than 4 ounces of cannabis. The measure directed the city manager to devise a plan to put the policy in effect by September 1. Advocacy =State political parties= In June 2018, delegates at the Republican Party of Texas 2018 convention voted to approve a set of platform planks endorsing cannabis policy reform. Approved by the delegates were: * A plank calling for \\"a change in the law to make it a civil, and not a criminal, offense for legal adults only to possess one ounce or less of marijuana for personal use, punishable by a fine of up to $100, but without jail time\\" (passed with 81% of the vote). * A plank calling for the Texas Legislature to \\"improve the 2015 Compassionate Use Act to allow doctors to determine the appropriate use of cannabis to certified patients\\" (passed with 90% of the vote). * A plank calling for Congress to \\"remove cannabis from the list of Schedule 1 and move to Schedule 2\\" (passed with 82% of the vote). * A plank calling for the Texas Legislature to \\"pass legislation allowing cultivation, manufacture, and sale of industrial hemp and hemp products\\" (passed with 83% of the vote). Delegates at the Texas Democratic Party 2018 convention also voted in June to approve a set of platform planks endorsing cannabis policy reform. Approved by the delegates were: * A plank calling for legislation in Texas to \\"legalize possession and use of cannabis and its derivatives and to regulate its use, production and sale as is successfully done in Colorado, Washington and other States\\". * Planks calling for the \\"immediate legalization of medical cannabis\\" and \\"federal legislation to remove cannabis as a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance\\". * A plank calling for the \\"immediate release of individuals incarcerated for possession of cannabis and expungement of criminal records of persons convicted or receiving Deferred Adjudication for misdemeanor cannabis offenses\\". * A plank calling for the \\"legalization of hemp for agricultural purposes\\". =Marijuana Lobby Day= Marijuana Lobby Day was first held in Austin in 2011, when 25 people showed up to press the issue to the legislature (which meets once every two years). In 2013, 50 people attended, in 2015 there were 300, and 375 in 2017.

It blends aspects of murder mystery games and card-based guessing games. One person plays a murdered ghost who can communicate with the other players only through a series of visions in the form of illustrated cards. The other players, who take the role of psychic mediums, must interpret these cards to identify a suspect, location, and murder weapon.  Gameplay  Thirty years ago, a servant was murdered in his employer‚Äôs mansion during a party. A group of mediums organize a s√©ance to solve the mystery. The ultimate goal of the ghost is to indicate who killed him, where, and with what weapon. A series of illustrated cards are laid out for each of three stages: one for suspects, one for locations, and one for murder weapons. One person plays as the ghost. This player may not directly communicate with the other players, who play the mediums; however, the mediums may collaborate. The ghost secretly selects a suspect, location, and murder weapon for each medium to guess. Each round, the ghost hands out one or more illustrated cards to each medium. Mediums progress through the stages by correctly guessing their respective suspect, location, and murder weapon. Players may indicate whether they believe guesses to be correct or not through tokens. If all players have advanced past the third stage by round seven, the ghost gives a final clue as to which medium holds the true identity of the ghost's murderer. Depending on how quickly players advanced through the stages and how many correct tokens they have placed, they may see one, two, or three cards from the ghost. Players may again collaborate on interpretation of the cards, but their final vote must be secret. If the majority guesses correctly, the players win and the ghost is set free to enjoy the afterlife.  Publication  Mysterium was initially published as –ú—ñ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—ñ—É–º in Ukraine. French publisher Libellud, after acquiring the English- and French-language rights, made several changes to the rules and art.  Reception  Polygon identified it as one of the best games of Gen Con 2015. Nate Anderson of Ars Technica called it a \\"truly novel\\" combination of Dixit and Clue. Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle rated it 5/5 stars and also compared it to Dixit and Clue.

She dressed as a man and accompanied her husband on the battlefield, and was later awarded a pension for her courage in the Battle of Germantown. Early life Little is known about Anna Maria Lane's early life, though it is believed she may be from New Hampshire. By 1776, she had married John Lane.

Although some women accompanied the soldiers as camp followers during the American Revolution to help out as cooks, nurses or laundresses, Lane was the only documented woman in Virginia to dress as a man and fight on the battle field. Historians have speculated that it probably wasn't difficult for Lane to pass as a man, because Revolutionary soldiers didn't bathe very often and slept in their uniforms.Hakim, Joy From Colonies to Country, Volume 3, Oxford University Press, Sep 15, 2002, p 107 \\"As far as enlistment, there are no physicals when one enters the Army in the 18th century,\\" said historian Joyce Henry, \\"One must have front teeth and an operating thumb and forefinger so one may be able to reach in, grab a cartridge, tear off the paper, and be able to successfully load your musket.\\" Lane and her husband fought in campaigns in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. On October 3, 1777, they served under George Washington in the Battle of Germantown, near Philadelphia, where Anna Maria was severely wounded, which left her lame for life.-Library of Virginia, Shaping the Constitution: Anna Marie Lane Just before the Battle of Germantown, George Washington had issued an edict which forbade women \\"camp followers\\" from accompanying men to the battlefield, so some historians have suggested that Anna Maria did not want to receive treatment for her wound for fear of being discovered. Despite her injury, Anna Maria continued fighting alongside her husband when he re-enlisted in the Virginia Light Dragoons. She was with him when he was wounded in The Siege of Savannah in 1779.An Encyclopedia of American Women at War:Tendrich Frank, Lisa, From the Home Front to the Battlefields, Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, 2013, p 350-51 They both served until 1781. Later life Letter from William Cabell about Anna Maria Lane After the war ended in 1783, the Lanes settled down in Virginia. John Lane worked for a while at the state arsenal at Point of Fork in Fluvanna County. In 1801 the couple moved to Richmond, Virginia where he joined the Public Guard. They lived in the barracks of the Public Guard with their three children and received daily rations.Tendrich Frank, Lisa, An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields, Volume 1 ABC- CLIO, 2013 In Richmond, Anna Maria volunteered to tend to soldiers at the military hospital. There, she met Dr. John H Foushee, who asked Governor James Monroe and the Council of State to authorize a small stipend for her nursing work. Anna Maria Lane had apparently stopped working at the hospital by late 1804, since her name no longer appeared in the list of nurses in the council journal. In 1808, after Lane's husband and several other men were discharged from the public guard for disability, Governor William H Cabell asked the General Assembly to give pensions to those disabled male soldiers, as well as a few women. Cabell specifically mentioned Anna Maria Lane, writing that she was \\"very infirm, having been disabled by a severe wound which she received while fighting as a common soldier, in one of our Revolutionary battles, from which she never has recovered, and perhaps never will recover.\\" Her pension notes that Anna Maria Lane was given $100 a year for life in recognition of the fact that she, 'in the Revolutionary War, performed extraordinary military services at the Battle of Germantown, in the garb, and with the courage of a soldier.\\" Death and legacy Lane died on June 13, 1810. It is not known when her husband John died. She did not become of interest to historians until the editor of the Richmond Magazine discovered her pension records and wrote an article about her in the 1920s. In 1997, the Virginia Sons of the American Revolution honored Anna Maria Lane by sponsoring a descriptive marker in Richmond, VA near the Bell Tower in Capitol Square, erected by the Department of Historic Resources.

Originally released in 1992 by J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, a Canadian publisher of militaria literature, it was licensed in 2002 by the firm to American publishers Ballantine Books and Stackpole Books. The series' books were a commercial success and enjoyed a wide readership among the American public. In the book The Myth of the Eastern Front, historians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies criticise Panzer Aces as ahistorical and misleading, presenting a picture of the German soldiers \\"without flaws or character defects\\". According to the authors, Kurowski's accounts, including Panzer Aces, are intended \\"to act as a memorial to these men\\". Background Franz Kurowski (1923‚àí2011) was a German author of fiction and non-fiction who is best known for producing apologist, revisionist and semi-fictional works on the history of World War II. His first publications appeared in the Nazi era; from 1958 until his death he worked as a freelance writer. He wrote 400 books for children and adults under his own name and various pseudonyms. Among other things, Kurowski wrote for the weekly pulp war stories series Der Landser. Kurowski produced numerous accounts featuring the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS, providing laudatory and non-peer-reviewed wartime chronicles of military units and highly decorated soldiers. Historians dismiss his works, pointing out that Kurowski's journalistic writing style leads to embellishments and half-truths. Mixing fact and fiction, his accounts emphasise heroics rather than provide an authentic representation of the war experience, thereby conveying a distorted image of the German armed forces in World War II. A number of Kurowski's books have been published by far-right publishing houses such as the and the , leading to his writings being described as \\"journalism of gray and brown zone\\".Hans Sarkowicz: Publizistik der Grau- und Braunzone. In: Wolfgang Benz Hrsg.: Rechtsextremismus in Deutschland, S. Fischer Verlag Frankfurt am Main 1994, p. 78. Publication and contents Kurowski's works were published in Germany, beginning in 1958, but remained inaccessible to English-speaking audiences. The Canadian publishing house J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, which specialises in World War II militaria literature, released Kurowski's Panzer Aces in the U.S. in 1992. The book was later licensed by Fedorowicz to the American publishers Ballantine Books and Stackpole Books, which issued it in 2002 and 2004, respectively. The narratives in Panzer Aces do not include bibliographies or cite sources; some of the accounts are presented in the first person. The Panzer Aces series focuses on the combat careers of successful German tank commanders and popular Waffen-SS personalities such as Kurt \\"Panzermeyer\\" Meyer, Jochen Peiper, Paul Hausser, and Rudolf von Ribbentrop, the son of Reich Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, among others. The series features a famous \\"panzer ace\\", Michael Wittmann, who enjoyed cult status in the popular perceptions of the Waffen-SS, along with the actions of another \\"ace\\", Franz B√§ke, in the Cherkassy Pocket. In Kurowski's retelling, after fighting unit after unit of the Red Army, B√§ke is able to establish a corridor to the trapped German forces, while \\"wiping out\\" the attacking Soviets. In another of Kurowski's accounts, while attempting to relieve the 6th Army encircled in Stalingrad, B√§ke destroys thirty-two enemy tanks in a single engagement. Reception Historians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies describe Panzer Aces and its companion Infantry Aces, published by Fedorowicz in 1994, as \\"classics\\", noting that they \\"continue to enjoy a widespread and enthusiastic readership\\". In their analysis of the series, which also includes Panzer Aces II and Panzer Aces III, they write: > Kurowski gives the readers an almost heroic version of the German soldier, > guiltless of any war crimes, actually incapable of such behavior. (...) > Sacrifice and humility are his hallmarks. Their actions win them medals, > badges and promotions, yet they remain indifferent to these awards. The > cover art evokes heroism, determination and might of the German soldier and > his weapons. In addition to facts, Kurowski's writing contained fictional stories. The historian Roman T√∂ppel notes that it is \\"regrettable that Kurowski was sometimes perceived as a culturally worthy historian in foreign [non-German language] historical studies.\\" Thus, Kurowski's fictional assertions found their way into popular history books on World War II, and even into serious literature. Smelser and Davies describe Kurowski's version of the war on the Eastern Front as \\"well-nigh chivalrous\\", with German troops \\"showing concerns for the Russian wounded, despite the many atrocities\\" of the Soviets against the Germans. In one of Kurowski's accounts, Michael Wittmann takes out eighteen tanks in a single engagement, for which Sepp Dietrich, Wittmann's commanding officer, presents him with an Iron Cross and inquires whether Wittmann has a request. Without hesitation, Wittmann requests assistance for a wounded \\"Russian\\" soldier that he spotted. Many similar acts of \\"humanity\\" are present in the books, amounting to an image of the German fighting men \\"without flaws or character defects\\". Smelser and Davies conclude that \\"Kurowski's accounts are laudatory texts that cast the German soldier in an extraordinarily favorable light\\". According to Smelser and Davies, Kurowski's accounts, including Panzer Aces, celebrate the German soldiers who (in Kurowski's worldview) served their country honourably and fought valiantly against tremendous odds, only to return to Germany, as he puts it, \\"wounded and broken, ashamed and beaten\\". They write that the author's aim is to restore their reputation and that he \\"intends his books to act as an appropriate memorial to these men\\".

It stars David Bowie as the title character, a mysterious man who leaves after death a series of clues to a 12-year-old boy with cancer, to help him appreciate life. The production was filmed in 1998 and released in 2000. Plot Owen Walters (Bill Switzer) is 12 and suffers from Hodgkin's disease. He has a group of friends who award points to each other for doing risky or strange acts. Owen's parents want him to befriend Simon, who has leukemia, but he rejects him as he considers Simon to be more ill than he, reminding him of his own mortality. He also rejects his best friend Funnel Head (Zach Lipovsky) to win the approval of bullies. Owen's mysterious neighbour Mr. Rice dies, and Owen secretly videotapes the funeral to show to his friends. They go to Rice's house to watch it on his video player, and scour through his belongings, finding a letter for Owen. He decodes it with a ring he received from Rice, and finds that it is a series of clues leading to a secret. The boys go looking for the clues, one of which involves exhuming Rice. Rice appears in flashbacks over the film, including one where he tells Owen \\"All people, no matter who they are, they all wish they'd appreciated life more. It's what you do in life that's important, not how much time you have‚Äù. Owen finds the potion of life which allowed Rice to live for 400 years. However, he makes a recovery from his treatment, and instead gives the potion to Simon to save his life. Production The film was written by J. H. Wyman and directed by Nicholas Kendall, an instructor at Capilano University in Vancouver. Most of it was filmed in New Westminster, in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. Peter O'Toole was originally considered for the role of Rice, but negotiations fell through and the role went to Bowie, who enjoyed reading the script. Recording had begun before Bowie was cast, and the crew were amazed that he would be in the film. The filming location was kept secret so that Bowie would not be disturbed. Kendall recalled Bowie as a quiet and introverted man, who had remarked that he wanted a clone so that he could act alongside his musical and artistic interests. Producer Colleen Hardwick, who had idolised Bowie as a schoolgirl, said she \\"about died\\" to hear him make the phonecall to accept the role. She too recalled how he mixed with all members of the cast and crew. Hardwick likened Rice's advice to Owen with how Bowie accepted his own imminent death from cancer in January 2016. The film was originally known as Exhuming Mr. Rice. It was released on DVD in Region 1 in September 2001 and Region 2 that November. Reception David Bowie was praised for his portrayal of Mr. Rice, although the lack of development of the character and the brevity of the role were criticised The film received mixed reviews. The Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes rates it as 50% from six reviews, with equal numbers of generally positive and negative reviews. Robert Roten of the Laramie Movie Scope gave the film a B, for telling a story about cancer in a \\"very non-depressing and positive way\\". He found Owen to be a well-developed character and a realistic reflection of children struggling with cancer. Roten summed the film up as \\"very well-written, well-acted and well-directed\\" and also praised its \\"haunting, etheral Celtic-flavored music\\", but pointed out that fans of Bowie would be disappointed that he only appears for around ten minutes. Writing for Film Journal International, Maria Garcia noted that there were plot holes that adults would notice, but in all the film was \\"didactic, yet not condescending, and inspirational without being corny. That's quite an achievement for any film, but especially for one that takes the high moral ground, as this one does\\". James Kendrick of Q called the plot \\"clever\\" without being \\"preachy\\" about its theme. He was impressed by Switzer's role as a complex character. However, he pointed out that although Rice's appearances exclusively in flashbacks created an \\"aura\\" around the character, it should have been explained how he and Owen had become friends in the first place. Kendrick was repulsed by the scene of the children exhuming Rice, finding it too graphic to be legitimately considered as a metaphor for Owen confronting death eye-to- eye. In The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell found Bowie to be the highlight of the film, noting how he brought a presence to small roles. However, Mitchell called the film \\"bland and ordinary\\", naming the exhumation scene as one of few exceptions.

The movie premiered at the Toronto Festival of Festivals in September 1990. While shooting the movie Kaurism√§ki tried to minimize the movie and crew's impact on the environment, which he tried to minimize by choosing equipment that would have the least impact on the shooting location, the surrounding areas, and its inhabitants.  Synopsis  The film centers upon a Finnish businessman named Kari and his two daughters. The trio has gone to Brazil, where he decides to investigate the possibility of starting a gold mining operation in the nearby rainforest, urged on Dan, an American expatriate interested in entering a business arrangement with Kari. He's warned against this by a local woman, Paola, who tells him that mining would have disastrous repercussions on the jungle and its inhabitants. The two begin to fall in love and Kari starts to doubt his plans. However, before he can truly act on these concerns with his prospective business partner, Kari and Dan are involved in an airplane accident that kills Dan and leave Kari terribly wounded.
