The municipality covers an area of . The railway line from Olomouc to P≈ôerov runs west of the village. The next train station is at neighbouring Brodek u P≈ôerova. History In the 13th century, a water castle existed at the site. The place was first mentioned in a 1277 deed, when one Herman of Moiethin acted as mediator in a border dispute between the abbeys of Hradisko and Velehrad. In 1306, King Wenceslaus III of Bohemia vested Lord Unka of Moyetyn with extended woodland estates which also were claimed by the Olomouc citizens who founded the village of Grygov. A lengthy conflict arose which was finally decided in 1352 by the Moravian margrave John Henry in favour of Olomouc. The Lords of Majet√≠n remained in dispute with their neighbours; during the Hussite Wars they supported the insurgents, whereafter Emperor Sigismund had their castle demolished. When the line became extinct in 1440, the estates changed hands several times. In 1521 Majet√≠n was purchased by the Moravian governor John III of Pernstein and incorporated into the Lordship of Tovaƒçov. The present-day municipality was established in 1850. A village church was erected in 1863, dedicated to Saints Cyril and Methodius; the Majet√≠n parish arose in 1872. Notable people The Meitner family, ancestors of Austrian nuclear physicist Lise Meitner (1878‚Äì1968), settled in Majet√≠n. Under the rule of Emperor Joseph II in the late 18th century, they adopted the surname Meietheiner, derived from their place of origin.

Buddhism  There are many views among Buddhists on the issue of euthanasia, but many are critical of the procedure. An important value of Buddhism teaching is compassion. Compassion is used by some Buddhists as a justification for euthanasia because the person suffering is relieved of pain.Keown, Damien. ‚ÄúEnd of life: the Buddhist View,‚Äù Lancet 366 (2005): 953. SocINDEX with full text, EBSCOhost. However, it is still immoral \\"to embark on any course of action whose aim is to destroy human life, irrespective of the quality of the individual's motive.\\" Keown, Damien. ‚ÄúEnd of life: the Buddhist View,‚Äù Lancet 366 (2005): 954.

In Theravada Buddhism a lay person daily recites the simple formula: \\"I undertake the precept to abstain from destroying living beings.\\"This is the first of the Five Precepts. It has various interpretations. For Buddhist monastics (bhikkhu) however the rules are more explicitly spelled out. For example, in the monastic code (Patimokkha), it states: :\\"Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (thus): 'My good man, what use is this wretched, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life,' or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in communion.\\" Thanissaro Bhikkhu (1994). Buddhist Monastic Code I: Chapter 4, Parajika . Retrieved 2007-11-11. Christianity= Catholicism = The Declaration on Euthanasia is the Church's official document on the topic of euthanasia, a statement that was issued by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1980. Catholic teaching condemns euthanasia as a \\"crime against life\\" and a \\"crime against God\\". The teaching of the Catholic Church on euthanasia rests on several core principles of Catholic ethics, including the sanctity of human life, the dignity of the human person, concomitant human rights, due proportionality in casuistic remedies, the inevitability of death, and the importance of charity. It has been argued that these are relatively recent positions,McDougall H, It's popularly believed that Catholics are anti- euthanasia. Do Catholics believe we don't have the freedom to do as we like? The Guardian 27 August 2009 but whatever the position of individual Catholics, the Roman Catholic Church's viewpoint is unequivocal.Catechism of the Catholic Church = Protestantism = Protestant denominations vary widely on their approach to euthanasia and physician assisted death. Since the 1970s, Evangelical churches have worked with Roman Catholics on a sanctity of life approach, though some Evangelicals may be adopting a more exceptionless opposition. While liberal Protestant denominations have largely eschewed euthanasia, many individual advocates (such as Joseph Fletcher) and euthanasia society activists have been Protestant clergy and laity. As physician assisted dying has obtained greater legal support, some liberal Protestant denominations have offered religious arguments and support for limited forms of euthanasia. However, they are more lenient than the Roman Catholic Church = Orthodoxy = The Orthodox Church in America, along with other Eastern Orthodox Churches, also opposes euthanasia, stating that it must be condemned as murder stating that, \\"Euthanasia is the deliberate cessation to end human life.\\" = Christian groups in support of euthanasia = Groups claiming to speak for Christians rather than the official viewpoints of the Christian clergy have sprung up in a number of countries. Hinduism There are two Hindu points of view on euthanasia. By helping to end a painful life a person is performing a good deed and so fulfilling their moral obligations.Euthanasia may also be acceptable if it is used for selfless motives. On the other hand, by helping to end a life, even one filled with suffering, a person is disturbing the timing of the cycle of death and rebirth. This is a bad thing to do, and those involved in the euthanasia will take on the remaining karma of the patient. Death is a natural process, and will come in time. It is clearly stated in the Vedas that man has only two trustworthy friends in life, the first is called Vidya (knowledge), and the 2nd is called Mrityu (Death). The former is something that is beneficial and a requirement in life, and the latter is something that is inevitable sometimes even unexpected. It is not the euthanasia that is the act of sin, but worldly attachment which causes euthanasia to be looked upon as an act of sin. Even a Sannyasin or Sannyasini if they decide to, are permitted to end his or her life with the hope of reaching moksha i.e. emancipation of the soul.  Islam  Muslims are against euthanasia. They believe that all humans life is sacred because it is given by God, and that God chooses how long each person lives. Human beings should not interfere in this. It is forbidden for a Muslim to plan, or come to know through self-will, the time of his own death in advance. Jainism Jainism is based on the principle of non-violence (ahinsa) and is best known for it. Jainism recommends voluntary death or sallekhana for both ascetics and srƒÅvaka (householders) at the end of their life. Sallekhana (also known as Santhara, Samadhi-marana) is made up of two words sal (meaning 'properly') and lekhana, which means to thin out. Properly thinning out of the passions and the body is sallekhana. A person is allowed to fast unto death or take the vow of sallekhana only when certain requirements are fulfilled. It is not considered suicide as the person observing it, must be in a state of full consciousness. When observing sallekhana, one must not have the desire to live or desire to die. Practitioner shouldn't recollect the pleasures enjoyed or, long for the enjoyment of pleasures in the future. The process is still controversial in parts of India. Estimates for death by this means range from 100 to 240 a year.\\"Fasting to Death\\" in: Docker C, Five Last Acts ‚Äì The Exit Path, 2013:428-432 (details benefits and difficulties) Preventing santhara invites social ostracism.Colors of Truth Religion, Self and Emotions: Perspectives of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Islam, Sikhism and Contemporary Psychology by Sonali Bhatt Marwaha, 2006:125.  Judaism  Like the trend among Protestants, Jewish medical ethics have become divided, partly on denominational lines, over euthanasia and end of life treatment since the 1970s. Generally, Jewish thinkers oppose voluntary euthanasia, often vigorously,For example, J. David Bleich, Eliezer Waldenberg though there is some backing for voluntary passive euthanasia in limited circumstances.Such as the writings of Daniel Sinclair, Moshe Tendler, Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, Moshe Feinstein Likewise, within the Conservative Judaism movement, there has been increasing support for passive euthanasia (PAD)See Elliot Dorff and, for earlier speculation, Byron Sherwin. In Reform Judaism responsa, the preponderance of anti-euthanasia sentiment has shifted in recent years to increasing support for certain passive euthanasia options. Secular Judaism is a separate category with increasing support for euthanasia. A popular sympathiser for euthanasia is Rabbi Miriam Jerris.http://www.ifshj.net/id91.html A study performed in 2010 investigated elderly Jewish women who identified themselves as either Hasidic Orthodox, non-Hasidic Orthodox, or secularized Orthodox in their faith. The study found that all of the Hasidic Orthodox responders disapproved of voluntary euthanasia whereas a majority of the secularized Orthodox responders approved of it.Baeke, Goedele, Jean-Pierre Wils, and Bert Broeckaert, ‚Äú‚ÄòWe are (not) the master of our body‚Äô: elderly Jewish women‚Äôs attitudes towards euthanasia and assisted suicide,‚Äù Ethnicity and Health 16, no. 3 (2011): 259-278, SocINDEX with full text, EBSCOhost. Shinto In Japan, where the dominant religion is Shinto, 69% of the religious organisations agree with the act of voluntary passive euthanasia. The corresponding figure was 75% when the family asked for it. In Shinto, the prolongation of life using artificial means is a disgraceful act against life. Views on active euthanasia are mixed, with 25% Shinto and Buddhist organisations in Japan supporting voluntary active euthanasia. Unitarian Universalism The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) recommends observing the ethics and culture of the resident country when determining euthanasia. In 1988 the UUA gathered to share a commitment to The Right to Die with Dignity document which included a resolution supporting self-determination in dying.Euthanasia: A Reference Handbook - Page 24, Jennifer Fecio McDougall, Martha Gorman - 2008  Influence of religious views  Religious views on euthanasia are both varied and complicated. While one's view on the matter doesn't necessarily connect directly to their religion, it often impacts a person's opinion. While the influence of religion on one's views toward palliative care do make a difference, they often play a smaller role than one may think. An analysis of the connection between the religion of US adults and their view on euthanasia was done in order to see how they combine. The findings concluded that the religious affiliation one associates with does not necessarily connect with their stance on euthanasia. Moulton, Benjamin E., Terrence D. Hill, and Amy Burdette. \\"Religion and Trends in Euthanasia Attitudes among U.S. Adults, 1977‚Äì2004.\\" Sociological Forum 21.2 (2006): 249-72. Web. Research shows that while many belong to a specific religion, they may not always see every aspect as relevant to them. Some metadata analysis has supported the hypothesis that nurses‚Äô attitudes towards euthanasia and physician assisted suicide are influenced by religion and world view. Attributing more importance to religion also seems to make agreement with euthanasia and physician assisted suicide less likely.Religion and Nurses‚Äô Attitudes to Euthanasia and Physician Assisted Suicide, Nursing Ethics 2009. The subject is also dealt with at length in Johannes A. van der Ven, Hans-Georg Ziebertz (eds.) Human Rights and the Impact of Religion, Koninklijke 2013. A 1995 study of public opinion found that the tendency to see a distinction between active euthanasia and suicide was clearly affected by religious affiliation and education.Caddell D, Newton R, Euthanasia: American attitudes toward the physician's role. Soc Sci Med. 1995 Jun;40(12):1671-81. In Australia, more doctors without formal religious affiliation were sympathetic to active voluntary euthanasia, and acknowledged that they had practiced it, than were doctors who gave any religious affiliation. Of those identifying with a religion, those who reported a Protestant affiliation were intermediate in their attitudes and practices between the agnostic/atheist and the Catholic groups. Catholics recorded attitudes most opposed, but even so, 18 percent of Catholic medical respondents who had been so requested, recorded that they had taken active steps to bring about the death of patients.Baume P, O'Malley E, Bauman A, Professed religious affiliation and the practice of euthanasia.

In 1957, he founded Materials Research Corporation (MRC). Though their initial interest was the purity and characterization of metals, MRC would grow to become a global manufacturer and supplier of highly specialized semiconductor materials and equipment. Early years Sheldon Weinig attended Stuyvesant High School, a magnet school in New York. After completing high school, he served in the United States Army for two years and received his education on the GI Bill and was awarded his doctorate in metallurgy from Columbia University. Dr. Weinig served as a Professor at Cooper Union and NYU for several years and then went on to found Materials Research Corporation. Materials Research Corporation= Innovator and Leader= Sheldon Weinig's innovative nature spanned several domains beyond metallurgy. He understood people, finance, and international relations. In the technological arena, MRC consistently introduced leading-edge (some say bleeding-edge) manufacturing equipment to the semiconductor industry. Their electronic materials set the pace for the industry. Innovative business methods led the company to invent equipment for their own use. In turn, some of this equipment would have commercial value and become products. As with any business, MRC had its share of economic ups and downs, and Dr. Weinig met each of those challenges head-on, keeping the company in business for over 30 years. Under Dr. Weinig's stewardship, MRC was one of the most progressive workplaces in Rockland County, NY and their employee benefits were well-known and spoken of at other companies. He designed the company benefits program around the idea of \\"giving as much as we can afford, not the least we could get away with.\\" Dr. Weinig explained that he wanted his employees to be able to concentrate on their work instead of having to worry about job security or their family's health. In addition to a generous medical and dental benefits package, MRC was one of the earlier companies to implement a 401K match. But two benefits in particular had the distinctive Weinig stamp: lifetime employment and the educational policy. The idea of lifetime employment was that you would always have a job, no matter what was going on with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. When the industry was on the down side, MRC canceled all contracted services such as security, custodial, and landscaping and put employees in the slow areas to work in the gardens and such. MRC offered a lifetime employment plan for as long as the company could bear it and eventually, it had to be discontinued after 25 years. MRC's educational policy under Dr. Weinig was one line: \\"you pass, we pay.\\" Any major area of study was open to any employee. An engineer could study English, an Administrative Assistant could study computer science, and a machinist could study Journalism. Dr. Weinig would say that he wanted his employees \\"thinking in their off hours.\\" He felt that in the field of semiconductors, an Engineering degree would be obsolete within five years. =Awards and recognition= ;1980:Awarded the SEMMY Award, by the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute ;1984:Inducted into the National Academy of Engineering for his technological contributions to the field of electronic materials ;1990:Elected to the International Technology Institute‚Äôs Hall of Fame for Engineering, Science and Technology ;1988:Awarded the rank of Chevalier dans l‚ÄôOrdre National de la Legion d‚ÄôHonneur by the Government of France He also received three honorary doctorates from St. Thomas Aquinas (law), Adelphi University (Science) and the State university of New York at Stony Brook. (Science) =Sale to Sony= In 1989, Sony acquired MRC. The U.S. Government objected to the sale but the company needed a large infusion of capital and no American-owned company was prepared to make the investment to purchase MRC and keep it (and its technology) intact. Sony, a company utilizing thin films in many areas from semiconductor manufacture to tapes and CD's understood the tremendous strength that MRC had in thin film technology and acquired the company. Dr. Weinig remained with Sony nearly 7 years as Vice Chairman for Engineering and Manufacturing of Sony America. He retired from Sony in 1995 and has been an Adjunct Professor at Columbia University and SUNY, Stony Brook where he teaches a bridge course between academia and the industrial world. Retirement from Industry Dr. Weinig retired as Vice Chairman of Engineering and Manufacturing of Sony America in 1996 and became an Adjunct Professor at Columbia University as well as the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Many other contemporary kingdoms used the same title for their ministers. Etymology Historian Mahesh Chandra Regmi suggests that Kaji is derived from Sanskrit word Karyi which meant functionary. History Ganesh Pande was the first Kaji under King Dravya Shah of Gorkha Kingdom. He helped Dravya Shah to become King of Gorkha and was later appointed Kaji of Gorkha in 1559 A.D. Another significant Kaji of Gorkha was Kalu Pande born in the family of Ganesh Pande. He was son of Bhimraj Pande who was also a Kaji during the reign of King Nara Bhupal Shah. Kalu Pande led Gorkhalis in the Battle of Kirtipur. He had set up a base on Naikap, a hill on the valley's western rim, from where they were to mount their assaults on Kirtipur.Vansittart, Eden (1896). Notes on Nepal. Asian Educational Services. . Page 34. He was killed in the battle after being surrounded by enemy forces. Page 227. The ministers and officials of Kantipur Kingdom also had the title of Kaji. Kashiram Thapa was a Kaji and army commander in the reign of King Jaya Prakash Malla. Both as per Francis Buchanan-Hamilton and Dilli Raman Regmi, there were 4 Kajis forming the government in Nepal. In the rule of King Rana Bahadur Shah, 4 Kajis were appointed and were to work under the direction of King and Chautariya. The number of officers including Kajis changed after King Rana Bahadur abdicated in favour of his minor son Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah. During the reign of Bhimsen Thapa, there were inner and outer circle of Kajis who acted as decision making body and military commander and governors respectively. Kaji along with Chautariya and Bada Hakim were appointed to run the administration as governors. No single family had full dominance in the position of inner circle of government. All Thapas, Pandes, Basnets, Bistas and Rana-Magar held similar shares in the inner circle. =Mulkaji= Chief (Mul) Kaji was considered equivalent to Prime Minister of Nepal before King Rana Bahadur Shah created the position of Mukhtiyar in 1806 and carried executive powers of nation to completely control Nepalese administration. In 1794, King Rana Bahadur Shah came of age and appointed Kirtiman Singh Basnyat as Chief (Mul) Kaji among the newly appointed four Kajis though Damodar Pande was the most influential Kaji. Kirtiman had succeeded Abhiman Singh Basnyat as Chief Kaji. Kirtiman was secretly assassinated on 28 September 1801, by the supporters of Raj Rajeshwari Devi and his brother Bakhtawar Singh Basnyat, was then given the post of Chief (Mul) Kaji. Later Damodar Pande was appointed by Queen Rajrajeshwari as Chief Kaji. After the execution of Mulkaji Damodar Pande on March 1804, Ranajit Pande was appointed as Mulkaji (Chief Kaji) along with Bhimsen Thapa as second Kaji, Sher Bahadur Shah as Mul Chautariya and Ranganath Paudel as Raj Guru (Royal Preceptor).

It was opened in 1907 but was ruined and partially destroyed in the Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938. Later, the synagogue was deconsecrated and in 1995, it was replaced with a modern apartment tower.  History  Julius Wohlmuth's plans to transform Dollinergasse number 3 into a synagogue The erection of the D√∂bling Synagogue was preceded by the founding of the Temple Association ‚ÄúD√∂bling‚Äù at the end of the 19th century. It is not known exactly when the association was founded, but it was being supported by the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien in the 1890s. The association was based in the Vormosergasse; in 1904, it relocated to the Gatterburggasse. The association's plans for the construction of an expensive temple, probably in the Gatterburggasse, could not be realised by the association's leadership, and it seemed likely that the association would be disbanded in 1904. Although the majority of the association's members were at first in favour of disbanding it, a group formed around Julius Lederer with the goal of constructing at least a modest prayer room. Lederer brought together a new leadership committee which decided to purchase a building in the Dollinergasse (number 3). With the support of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde, which subsidised the project with 40,000 Kronen, the building was transformed into a synagogue, designed by Julius Wohlmuth in Art Nouveau style. The synagogue was sanctified on 5 September 1907. It featured a prayer room with galleries for women and a total capacity of 460 seats, a language and religious school, as well as rooms for the Frauenwohlt√§tigkeitsverein f. d. XIX Bezirk (Ladies‚Äô Charity Organisation for the 19th District) and the Bund j√ºdischer Eltern, Wien XIX (League of Jewish Parents, Vienna 19th District). The building was ruined and heavily damaged in the Kristallnacht pogrom in 1938. Later, it was deconsecrated and robbed of its decorative fa√ßade. The building was finally torn down in 1995 and an apartment tower was erected on the site. A small plaque in front of the tower recalls the former existence of the synagogue.  The building  The D√∂bling Synagogue was a relatively small, two-storey building, with a narrow front in the Dollinergasse. The building was turned into an Art Nouveau synagogue designed by architect Julius Wohlmut. The synagogue's secessionist fa√ßade was noteworthy. It had risalits with narrow gables, each of which was flanked by a pair of Stars of David. The middle gable was decorated with a large Star of David and stylised rays of sunlight. A large round arched window ornamented the building's front in the Dollinergasse. Two marble tablets were placed in the entrance hall of the synagogue. One honoured Lederer's work; the other bore a quote from the Old Testament ‚ÄúMy house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples‚Äù (Isaiah 56:7). A memorial tablet for the victims of World War I was added in 1919.  See also  * History of the Jews in Vienna  References  * Pierre Gen√©e: Synagogenbauten in W√§hring und D√∂bling. In: David.

The high temperatures allow the metal to elongate, or stretch, to much greater degrees without rupture than are possible in previously utilized cold and warm forming methods. In addition, the metal can be formed into finer details and requires less overall forming force than traditional methods.  History and comparison with previous techniques HMGF is an evolution in the cost effectiveness and applicability of several existing commercial processes: superplastic forming, hot blow forming,Bill Dykstra (2001). ‚ÄúHot Metal Gas Forming for Manufacturing Vehicle Structural Components‚Äù, MetalForming and hydroforming. Complex tubes can be made from multiple sheet components formed and welded together, but this adds unnecessary cost and creates quality concerns at the joints. Hydroforming uses liquid under extreme pressures to form metal tubes. It was developed for the plumbing industry and by 1990 achieved production efficiencies suited for high volume autos. Typically hydroforming is done at ambient temperatures, and limits the forming elongation of metals to 8‚Äì12% diameter increase for aluminum, and 25‚Äì40% for steel. This limits the part shape complexity that can be produced. In addition, the workcenters and tooling can be large and expensive because of the internal fluid pressures required to form ambient tubes. HMGF is able to form tubes with larger shape complexity in only one forming step and generally at a lower internal pressure than in conventional tube hydroforming. Blow forming started with glass long ago, and is now a widespread method for forming plastic into hollow structures. Again, the heated material properties provide for many processing advantages. Warm forming has been the subject of extensive research in the past decades. It is defined as forming above ambient but below the recrystallization temperature of an alloy,, and using hydroform principles, can be done on tubes. Temperatures are typically limited due to safety concerns surrounding the heated forming fluids.xiHarry Singh (2006) ‚ÄúHEATforming: A new Freedom in Forming Tubular Structures‚Äù (conference report); 4th Annual North American ‚Äì Hydroforming Conference & Exhibition ‚Äì Sept. 2006 At these temperatures, cycle times may still be relatively long, and elongations still do not approach that of hot forming.Yingyout Aue‚Äêu‚Äêlan et al. (2006), \\"Warm forming magnesium, aluminum tubes\\", The Fabricator, 2006‚Äê3‚Äê10, retrieved 2009‚Äê12‚Äê6 from thefabricator.com Superplastic forming is often applied in the aerospace industry, but it requires the use of very fine grain metal alloys, deformed up to very large strain values, but at a very low strain rate. HMGF is therefore potentially faster than superplastic forming. As a natural evolution, the need for HMGF created research starting in the 1990s. Fast cycle times, inexpensive tooling and machinery resulting from pressures an order of magnitude lower than hydroforming, and extreme forming ratios due to high temperature forming create a compelling business case for high volume low cost manufacturing. In 1999, development of the HMGF techniques began as an Advanced Technology Program (ATP) project funded by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).ATP Project Brief, http://jazz.nist.gov/atpcf/prjbriefs/prjbrief.cfm?ProjectNumber=98‚Äê01‚Äê0168 This project completed in 1993 and research showed up to 150% expansion ratios for aluminum and 50% with steel were possible, with further expansion capabilities by use of end feeding of material to minimize wall thinning. In order to keep pace with the US research, a European project was funded by the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS). Starting in July 2004, with a duration of 3 years, this project further investigated the HMGF process. By 2007, the consortium of European research and commercial entities proved concepts of simpler heating and die construction, and while focusing on the more demanding steel alloys, illustrated free deformation of 140% by use of end feeding to control wall thinning and delay rupture. The method used in these experiments is patented under . Also in Europe, parallel research yielded an innovative approach to the concept. By 2006, the HEATform method of hot metal gas forming showed evidence of unique metal shapes that had \\"historically only been possible in the domain of glass blowing and blow molded parts\\" with aluminum forming in excess of 270% expansion ratio at a production intended cycle time of 20 seconds. Citing that hardening and subsequent breakage will limit forming of the aluminum alloy below , the best flow behavior was observed at . This is significantly higher than the capabilities of warm liquid or warm gas pressure forming. The HEATform techniques of end feeding control achieved uniform wall thickness up to 300% strain values.Harry Singh (2006) ‚ÄúHEATforming: A new Freedom in Forming Tubular Structures‚Äù (conference report); 4th Annual North American ‚Äì Hydroforming Conference & Exhibition ‚Äì Sept. 2006 While significant research into material compatibility and predictive analysis techniques is ongoing, hot metal gas forming has been commercialized by at least one company who is providing hot expansion coupled with material end feeding.  Applications  Typical applications are in the automotive and aerospace industries where the precursor technology of hydroforming is well known. Other applications include sports equipment and furniture. The multi-material capability are used in decorative workpieces and plumbing fixtures.  Materials  The HMGF process is compatible with almost any metal. The most significant benefit of HMGF is that cold form resistant materials become viable for complex forming. Often, alloys are enhanced with expensive materials to enable cold forming and increase machinability, however with HMFG a less expensive alloy can be used, which reduces piece prices. One example is the use of ferritic stainless steels, like the 1.4512 alloy for exhaust components. Typically, the more expensive austenitic stainless is chosen, like the 1.4301 alloy, for parts requiring complex forming due to its 40% advantage in ambient formability (38.5% vs. 27.4% typical A%). Hardenable metal alloys (e.g. boron steels) can be used in HMGF. In this case the die can be used not only as a shaping tool, but also as a tempering tool, so that the final hardness of the formed tube after forming and cooling is increased. The process is often called \\"press hardening\\" in this case.

Often working with librettist J. Cheever Goodwin, he produced several scores for Broadway productions in the 1890s. Biography Woolson Morse was born February 24, 1856, in Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts. His parents were Charles R. Morse (a relative of Samuel Morse) of Vermont, and Mary Ann Judkins of Charlestown, Massachusetts.Information from Morse's wedding certificate, 1893 Manhattan, certificate number 13295. He attended secondary school at the Noble School and studied harmony at Boston Conservatory. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then went to Paris, France, to study art. After a few years he gave that up, returned to America and took up musical composition in earnest. =Career= For his first major work, Cinderella at School, Morse borrowed scenery and convinced a group of amateurs to produce the show at Springfield, Massachusetts.Details of Morse's biography come from a three-page typescript dated 1946 by Thomas B. Donaldson, located in the Billy Rose Theatre Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Cinderella at School was produced March 5, 1881. The son of Augustin Daly related how his father became producer of the show: > Mr. Woolson Morse came to Daly with the manuscript of a musical play > suggested by Thomas William Robertson's School which, in turn, had been > taken from the German. Morse was without musical education, but carried in > his head a number of pretty tunes. Mollenhauer, the leader of the orchestra, > put the composer's idea into form and did the harmonizing and orchestrating. In the 1880s, Morse and another Bostonian, J. Cheever Goodwin, were small part actors in various benefits for notables at Boston theaters. Moving to New York in 1887,Date based on Morse's death certificate Manhattan, 1897, certificate number 13765. they began to write musicals together, with Goodwin writing the librettos, producing several on Broadway in the 1890s. Their first Broadway success was Wang in 1891. According to The New York Times, \\"Trained in musical composition in Germany, he was one of the first wholly capable American comic- opera composers.

North Bank Estate The North Bank Estate takes its name from a large old house with extensive grounds, which was purchased by H Guy Chester OBE in 1924. Chester and his family lived in Hazlehyrst, an Edwardian villa on Colney Hatch Lane, which is still part of the grounds. In 1932, an extensive programme of alterations and redecoration was carried out at the North Bank house and it was then placed at the disposal of the local Methodist church. On his sixtieth birthday, in February 1947, Chester handed over the whole estate to the national Methodist Church. The estate was again extended in 1960 and presently covers around including housing for MHA (formerly Methodist Homes for the Aged). Chester House For many years Guy Chester had \\"looked forward to a time when it might be possible to build a residential centre for young men and women who were either studying or working in London.\\" The need to find new premises for the Methodist Youth Department (MYD) led to a committee being set up in 1955 which agreed that a joint project \\"was not only feasible but also desirable.\\" Chester donated the site and the first ¬£50,000.

Grounds The estate has large grounds, which include formal gardens, lawns, ponds and a wood. Wild fauna includes foxes, rabbits and ducks.

Bill C-14, passed by the Parliament of Canada in June 2016, amended the Canadian Criminal Code so as to legalize both physician-administered euthanasia (PAE) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS), and to govern access to both procedures in Canada. Neither euthanasia nor assisted suicide are available to minors, nor on the grounds of mental illness, long-term disability, nor any curable condition. To prevent suicide tourism, it is available only to residents eligible for Canadian healthcare coverage. Advance directives are not allowed in Canada for voluntary euthanasia and patients cannot arrange to consent \\"in advance\\" to dying later at the hands of a caregiver (such as in cases of dementia or Alzheimer's disease where patients may want to die after they reach an advanced state of mental decline). Canada's assisted dying law includes legal safeguards aimed at preventing abuse and ensuring informed consent. Neither the legal witnesses, nor the physicians involved, can have any legal or financial interest in the outcomes of the patient. Consent must be repeatedly expressed, not implied, including in the moment right before death. Consent can be revoked at any time, in any manner. There are no consequences for backing out and there are no limits to how often it can be requested. To receive a medically assisted death, patients experiencing intolerable suffering must sign a written request expressing their wish to end their life in front of two independent witnesses who can both confirm it was done willingly free of coercion, 10 clear days before the date of death. Next, two physicians and/or nurse practitioners must independently confirm their written agreement that the patient has an incurable grievous and irremediable medical condition that is in an advanced state of irreversible decline, that the patient's natural death is reasonably foreseeable, and that the patient is capable and willing of receiving a medically assisted death. If they are eligible, patients must be informed about their palliative care options to relieve end-of-life suffering before they can die. Assisted suicide was previously prohibited under the criminal code as a form of culpable homicide. The prohibition was overturned in a February 2015 decision by the Supreme Court in Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), which ruled that adults with grievous and irremediable medical conditions are entitled to physician-assisted suicide. The Court delayed its suspension of invalidity for a period of 12 months, to allow Parliament the opportunity to amend its laws if it so chose.Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5 at para 128 In January 2016, the Court granted an additional four-month extension to the suspension to allow for further time. As an interim measure, it ruled that provincial courts can now begin approving applications for euthanasia pursuant to the criteria in the Carter decision. On 6 June 2016, the suspension of invalidity expired and the law was struck down. On 17 June 2016, a bill to legalize and regulate assisted dying passed in Canada's Parliament.BBC News, Canada's parliament passes assisted suicide bill 18 June 2016. The current law's requirement that a natural death must be \\"reasonably foreseeable\\" or \\"incurable\\", has been controversial for how it vastly limits the original Supreme Court of Canada ruling mandating assisted dying be made available to all adults with \\"grievous and irremediable\\" medical conditions. The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) is challenging the constitutionality of the current law because it excludes people with long-term disabilities and those with \\"curable\\" medical conditions whose only treatment options people may find unacceptable. The BCCLA argues these medical conditions should qualify under the court's definition of \\"grievous and irremediable\\". Canada's law on medical assistance in dying On 17 June 2016, Bill C-14 to legalize and regulate assisted dying passed in Canada's Parliament. This section outlines the details of this law. Strict rules govern access to assisted suicide. If they are not met, anyone who aids another person in killing themselves is guilty of a crime. Canada's law on assisted dying does not allow advance directives, nor does it allow it for minors or people who are suffering from a mental illness. Dr. Khalid who was one of first of many to assist the MAID of people under Bill c-14 =Availability under the law= Under Canadian law, a person may access medical assistance in dying only if they meet all of the following criteria: (a) they are eligible‚Äîor, but for any applicable minimum period of residence or waiting period, would be eligible‚Äîfor health services funded by a government in Canada; (b) they are at least 18 years of age and capable of making decisions with respect to their health; (c) they have a grievous and irremediable medical condition; (d) they have made a voluntary request for medical assistance in dying that, in particular, was not made as a result of external pressure; and (e) they give informed consent to receive medical assistance in dying after having been informed of the means that are available to relieve their suffering, including palliative care. =\\"Grievous and irremediable\\" medical condition= Before a request for an assisted death can be fulfilled, at least two physicians and/or nurse practitioners must confirm independently that the patient indeed has a \\"grievous and irremediable medical condition.\\" The two medical practitioners or nurse practitioners who make this determination must be independent from one another (i.e., one cannot work under the authority of the other) and have no legal or financial interest in the outcome of the patient. The law states that for a patient to have a grievous and irremediable medical condition eligible for assisted dying, they must meet all of the following criteria: (a) they have a serious and incurable illness, disease or disability; (b) they are in an advanced state of irreversible decline in capability; (c) that illness, disease or disability or that state of decline causes them enduring physical or psychological suffering that is intolerable to them and that cannot be relieved under conditions that they consider acceptable; and (d) their natural death has become reasonably foreseeable, taking into account all of their medical circumstances, without a prognosis necessarily having been made as to the specific length of time that they have remaining. When drafting the law in 2016, the last clause requiring death to be \\"reasonably foreseeable\\" has been controversial for how it narrows the scope of the original Supreme Court of Canada ruling as it excludes most mental illnesses or long term disabilities, vastly limiting who may have access to the procedure. =Legal safeguards= Canada's law has what it calls \\"robust safeguards to prevent errors and abuse in the provision of medical assistance in dying.\\" The drafters of the law argue they protect \\"vulnerable persons... from being induced, in moments of weakness, to end their lives.\\" Two independent witnesses Any person who is at least 18 years of age and who understands the nature of the request can act as an independent witness, unless they: (a) know or believe that they are a beneficiary under the will of the person making the request, or a recipient, in any other way, of a financial or other material benefit resulting from that person's death; (b) are an owner or operator of any health care facility at which the person making the request is being treated or any facility in which that person resides; (c) are directly involved in providing health care services to the person making the request; or (d) directly provide personal care to the person making the request. Two independent medical opinions Both medical practitioners and/or nurse practitioners involved must independently confirm via a written opinion both their agreement that a person has \\"a grievous and irremediable medical condition\\", and their agreement that the patient is capable and willing of receiving a medically assisted death. The medical or nurse practitioners making this determination must be independent (i.e., one cannot work under the authority of the other), and have no legal or financial interest in the outcome of the patient. A medical practitioner or nurse practitioner who helps in providing medical assistance in dying can be considered independent if they: (a) are not a mentor to the other practitioner or responsible for supervising their work; (b) do not know or believe that they are a beneficiary under the will of the person making the request, or a recipient, in any other way, of a financial or other material benefit resulting from that person's death, other than standard compensation for their services relating to the request; or (c) do not know or believe that they are connected to the other practitioner or to the person making the request in any other way that would affect their objectivity. 10-day waiting period Due to the \\"irrevocable nature of ending a life\\", to receive medical assistance in dying, patients must sign and date a written statement confirming their request to die in the presence of two independent witnesses, 10 clear days before the day they will die. If death or a loss of a capacity to provide consent is imminent, both medical practitioners or nurse practitioners can agree to waive or shorten the 10 day waiting period. If the person requesting medical assistance in dying is unable to sign and date the request, another person‚Äîwho is at least 18 years of age, who understands the nature of the request and who does not know or believe that they are a beneficiary under the will of the person making the request, or a recipient, in any other way, of a financial or other material benefit resulting from that person's death‚Äîmay do so in the person's presence, on the person's behalf and under the person's express direction. Must be informed about palliative care Before they can continue with receiving assisted dying, patients are required to be informed about what means are available to relieve their suffering, including palliative care options, to make sure that patients don't rush into the decision based on misconceptions or misinformation about what their future life may bring. Express consent required right before death A patient who chooses to pursue medical assistance in dying can revoke their consent at any time, in any manner, without fear of consequence. In addition to this, the law also requires the patient to be informed repeatedly and clearly that at any time they have a right to refuse medical assistance in dying. Patients must again give express consent of their wish to receive medical assistance in dying immediately before they receive it, and they must also be given an opportunity to withdraw the request immediately before the procedure is performed. If a patient has difficulty communicating, before the procedure can be performed physicians must ensure that all necessary measures have been taken to ensure a reliable method of communicating with the patient exists, so that patients at all times can understand the information provided to them, and can adequately communicate any decision they make back. Because of the law's strict insistence on express consent being present at all times, Canada's law does not allow advanced directives, or for people to consent in advance to receiving a medically assisted death at a later time, as those suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia may want to arrange. =Summary of legal steps= The actual text of the law states that before a medical practitioner or nurse practitioner provides a person with medical assistance in dying, the medical practitioner or nurse practitioner must (a) be of the opinion that the person meets all of the eligibility criteria (b) ensure that the person's request for medical assistance in dying was: * (i) made in writing and signed and dated by the person or by another person who is an independent observer, and * (ii) signed and dated after the person was informed by a medical practitioner or nurse practitioner that the person has a grievous and irremediable medical condition; (c) be satisfied that the request was signed and dated by the person‚Äîor by another person under subsection (4)‚Äîbefore two independent witnesses who then also signed and dated the request; (d) ensure that the person has been informed that they may, at any time and in any manner, withdraw their request; (e) ensure that another medical practitioner or nurse practitioner has provided a written opinion confirming that the person meets all of the criteria set out in subsection (1); (f) be satisfied that they and the other medical practitioner or nurse practitioner referred to in paragraph (e) are independent; (g) ensure that there are at least 10 clear days between the day on which the request was signed by or on behalf of the person and the day on which the medical assistance in dying is provided or‚Äîif they and the other medical practitioner or nurse practitioner referred to in paragraph (e) are both of the opinion that the person's death, or the loss of their capacity to provide informed consent, is imminent‚Äîany shorter period that the first medical practitioner or nurse practitioner considers appropriate in the circumstances; (h) immediately before providing the medical assistance in dying, give the person an opportunity to withdraw their request and ensure that the person gives express consent to receive medical assistance in dying; and (i) if the person has difficulty communicating, take all necessary measures to provide a reliable means by which the person may understand the information that is provided to them and communicate their decision. Permissiveness of current law Within the broader assisted suicide debate, Canada's laws are lenient in some areas but stricter in others. The law is lenient given that fewer than a dozen countries permit voluntary euthanasia in any form. Canadian lawmakers said they closely studied the experience of other countries when deciding which aspects of voluntary euthanasia to allow, and which parts not to allow. Canada's law is consistent with many other nations that allow voluntary forms of euthanasia in requiring at least two physicians to confirm the details of a diagnosis. It follows Oregon's law in requiring two witnesses also. Uniquely, Canada's law delegates the power of deciding medical eligibility for an assisted death to both physicians and nurse practitioners, a flexibility added in response to the concerns of rural areas who often struggle with having a shortage of doctors. Canada's law is more restrictive than those of Belgium and the Netherlands in that it does not permit minors access to assisted dying. Canada also does not allow assisted suicide on the grounds of mental illness, a practice allowed in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland. Advance directives cannot be used in Canada to give consent for voluntary euthanasia, a practice that Belgium allows. Additionally, Canada's law requires the presence of a terminal illness, while the law in Netherlands and Belgium allows the euthanasia of people suffering from a long-term disability. However, in contrast to laws in states like Oregon that only allow assisted suicide if there is a prognosis of death within 6 months, Canada's law keeps vague exactly how soon a death must be \\"reasonably foreseeable\\" in order to qualify for assisted dying, keeping this matter of judgment up to individual medical practitioners. As well as \\"assisted suicide\\" in the strict sense of the term‚Äîin which patients administer the medicine that kills them directly by themselves‚ÄîCanada's law is more permissive in this area as it allows practitioners to euthanize patients who want to die but who are physically unable to kill themselves. Canada also allows its mandatory 10-day waiting period requirements to be waived for those \\"whose death or loss of capacity to consent is imminent\\", provided this is agreed upon by both physicians or nurse practitioners. This is more flexible than euthanasia laws seen in places such as the United States, where waiting periods are firmly fixed into law as legal requirements that must be met. Arguments for The right of individual autonomy over one's body is reflected in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, part of Canada's Constitution, and by the decisions that have been taken by the Supreme Court of Canada since the Charter became law in 1982. Individual cases such as Ciarlariello v. Schacter and Rodriguez v. British Columbia have considered these decision-making factors in healthcare. In Ciarlariello v. Schacter,Ciarlariello v. Schacter, [1993 2 S.C.R. 119] . the Courts declared patients' right to refuse treatment and to withdraw from treatment even after it has begun. Justice Cory wrote at p. 135: > every patient has a right to bodily integrity. This encompasses the right to > determine what medical procedures will be accepted and the extent to which > they will be accepted. Everyone has the right to decide what is to be done > to one's own body. This includes the right to be free from medical treatment > to which the individual does not consent. This concept of individual > autonomy is fundamental to the common law and is the basis for the > requirement that disclosure be made to a patient. In Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General),Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1993 3 S.C.R. 519]. Justice Sopinka refers at p. 521 to autonomy over one's body and the \\"control over one's physical and psychological integrity\\". Sopinka argued that autonomy is about free choice, and that patients should not be subjected to treatment unless they have complete consent. He added that consent must come from a cognitively competent individual and must be informed about his or her decision. Autonomy is a central value in requesting the assistance in dying. The argument for assisted death is the belief that individuals should be able to live their lives accordingly without the law making those decisions for them because the state should only protect the lives of citizens with respect to their own choices. The idea of autonomy is based on the idea that deciding how we die belongs to our own choices and thus the decision of requesting medical aid to die should be based on personal choice. Arguments against The main argument that interferes between a legal standpoint and a moral standpoint is the fear that assistance with suicide will be administrated to less fully competent patients. Therefore, decriminalizing assisted suicide might lead to involuntary euthanasia causing a slippery slope. The slippery slope argument against assisted death takes on the concept that assisted death on incompetent patients is unavoidable. The argument against assisted death points towards safeguards in decriminalizing assisted suicide. Legal history=Laws on assisted suicide= Suicide was decriminalized in Canada in 1972. Physician- assisted suicide has been legal in the Province of Quebec, where it is referred to as \\"medical aid in dying\\", since June 5, 2014. It became legal in the entire country in June 2016 after the criminal prohibition was struck down. Subsequently new legislation was passed in Parliament pursuant to a 2015 Supreme Court of Canada decision. Before it had been amended in 2016, the Criminal Code of Canada stated in section 241(b) that \\"Every one who ... (b) aids or abets a person to commit suicide, whether suicide ensues or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years\\" On June 15, 2012, in a case filed by Gloria Taylor, the Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that provisions in the Criminal Code prohibiting doctor-assisted suicide were unconstitutional as they apply to severely disabled patients capable of giving consent. The court ruled that the Criminal Code provisions \\"infringe s. 7 [and s. 15 ] of the Charter, and are of no force and effect to the extent that they prohibit physician-assisted suicide by a medical practitioner in the context of a physician-patient relationship\\". Moreover, the court found that the relevant sections were legislatively overbroad, had a disproportionate effect on people with disabilities, and were \\"grossly disproportionate to the objectives it is meant to accomplish.\\" The landmark decision on this topic was provided by the Supreme Court of Canada on February 6, 2015, in the Carter v. Canada (Attorney General) case. The unanimous judgment overturned the legal ban on doctor- assisted suicide. However, the court provided the federal government with 12 months to enact the necessary legislation (such as revising the Criminal Code) to make doctor-assisted suicide legal across the country. The federal government subsequently requested a six-month extension for implementation; the arguments for this request were scheduled to be heard by the federal Supreme Court on January 11, 2016. The province of Quebec had legalized doctor-assisted suicide in June 2014. In late 2015 the province's Court of Appeal confirmed that their law did not contravene the country's Criminal Code because of the Carter v. Canada (Attorney General) ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada. Court Decisions= Ciarlariello v. Schacter = A 1993 decision made by the Supreme Court of Canada that established a patient's right to withdraw from a procedure that has already begun. Ms. Ciarlariello underwent two angiograms after experiencing bleeding in her brain. During the second procedure, she began to hyperventilate and asked the physician to stop the procedure. Nonetheless, the procedure was completed, and Ciarlariello suffered a severe reaction that left her quadriplegic. =Sue Rodriguez= Until recently, the most prominent case opposing this law was that of Sue Rodriguez, who after being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) requested that the Canadian Supreme Court allow someone to aid her in ending her life. Her request appealed to the principle of autonomy and respect for every person, which states that \\"everyone has the right to self-determination subject only to an unjust infringement on the equal and competing rights of others\\". Her main argument for her assisted suicide, however, appealed to the principle of equality and justice, which states that \\"everyone should be treated equally, and deviations from equality of treatment are permissible only to achieve equity and justice\\". The application of this principle to the case is as follows. Ms. Rodriguez's ALS would eventually lead her to lose her voluntary motor control. Therefore, this loss of motor control is a \\"handicap of ALS sufferers\\". Because suicide is not a crime, it was argued that Ms. Rodriguez was being discriminated against in her option of deciding to commit suicide with the help of another person due to her disability, without the law \\"providing a compensatory and equitable relief\\". Though in 1992, the Court refused her request, two years later, Sue Rodriguez, with the help of an unknown doctor, ended her life despite the Court's decision. Due to her death, the Canadian medical profession issued a statement through Dr. Tom Perry and Dr. Peter Graff, who both said that they had assisted some of their patients in speeding up their death. The Rodriguez case poses questions of the slippery slope argument. Sue Rodriguez argued that the Canadian government was violating her right to life, liberty and security of the person under section 7 of the Charter by robbing her of the freedom to end her life without assistance. Justice Sopinka stated that: \\"all persons who of the reason of disability are unable to commit suicide have a right to be free from government interference in procuring the assistance of others to take their life\\". However Justice McLachlin argued that: \\"our task was the much more modest one of determining whether, given the legislative scheme regulating suicide which Parliament has put in place, the denial to Sue Rodriguez of the ability to end her life is arbitrary and hence amounts to a limit on her security of the person which does not comport with the principles of fundamental justice\\". Chief Justice Lamer rejected this argument as a legal matter and stated: \\"While I share a deep concern over the subtle and overt pressures that may be brought to bear on such persons if assisted suicide is decriminalized, even in limited circumstances, I do not legalization that deprives a disadvantaged group of the right to equality can be justified solely on such speculative grounds, no matter how well-intentioned ... we simply do not and cannot know the range of implications that allowing some form of assisted suicide will have for persons with physical disabilities. What we do know and cannot ignore is the anguish of those in the position of Ms Rodriguez\\". The Chief Justice, however, did not recognize that Rodriguez was incapable of committing suicide and thus the court refused her request because the legal sanction of euthanasia did not constitute an active effort to restrict liberty and therefore, did not violate section 7 in that way. =Robert Latimer= Robert Latimer is a Canadian canola and wheat farmer who was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his daughter Tracy (November 23, 1980 ‚Äì October 24, 1993). This case sparked a national controversy on the definition and ethics of euthanasia as well as the rights of people with disabilities and two Supreme Court decisions: R. v. Latimer (1997), on section 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and later R. v. Latimer (2001), on cruel and unusual punishments under section 12 of the Charter. =Canadian Medical Association= Before the February 2015 Supreme Court of Canada decision, the Canadian Medical Association had maintained that it is not up to them to decide on the issue of euthanasia, but the responsibility of society. Though in 1995, the Canadian Senate Committee decided that euthanasia should remain illegal, they recommended that a new category of crime be specifically created for those charged with assisting in suicide, called \\"compassionate suicide\\". =Quebec College of Physicians= Before doctor-assisted suicide was made legal in Quebec in June 2014, the Quebec College of Physicians had declared that it was prepared to cross the line on the debate over euthanasia and proposed that it be included as part of the appropriate care in certain particular circumstances. =Quebec National Assembly= On June 5, 2014 Quebec became the first Canadian province to pass right-to-die legislation. The federal government challenged this measure but in December 2015, the Quebec Court of Appeal confirmed that the \\"medical aid in dying\\" law would stand in light of the Supreme Court decision in Carter v. Canada (Attorney General). =Bills C-407 and C-384= In June 2005, Francine Lalonde introduced in Parliament a private Bill C-407 that would have legalized assisted suicide in Canada, but the January 2006 election ended this bill. Lalonde was re-elected and reintroduced her bill to legalize assisted suicide, which the 2008 election ended. On May 13, 2009, Lalonde introduced another bill‚ÄîBill C-384‚Äîof the same nature as her other two attempts. The Bill was debated in the House of Commons, but died on April 21, 2010 in second reading House of Commons when the vote to advance Bill C-384 to the Justice and Human Rights committee failed 59 to 226. Nearly every member of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois supported the legislation along with one independent and a handful of Liberal, New Democratic Party (NDP) and Conservative MPs. Every other MP either abstained or voted against the bill. Conservative Minister of Democratic Reform Steven Fletcher, who is Canada's first quadriplegic Member of Parliament and Cabinet Minister, made a public point of order after the vote to have an abstention recorded for the bill inviting for the discussion. In December 2014, Conservative Senator Nancy Ruth and Liberal Senator Zlatan Campbell announced they will introduce a bill to legalize assisted suicide to the Canadian Senate. If the bill passes in the Senate, the bill would move to the House of Commons to be debated there before Parliament adjourns for the 42nd Canadian federal election. =Carter v. Canada (Attorney General) decision= The Supreme Court of Canada ruling in Carter v. Canada (Attorney General) states that the law banning assisted suicide of terminally-ill patients (based on the Rodriguez v British Columbia (Attorney General) decision) was unconstitutional, and violated Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Supreme Court issued a 12-month suspended declaration of invalidity. As a result of the decision voluntary euthanasia was expected to be made legal for \\"a competent adult person who (1) clearly consents to the termination of life and (2) has a grievous and irremediable medical condition (including an illness, disease or disability) that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition\\".End-of-life law and policy in Canada. University of Dalhousie However, the law as passed was much more restrictive than the court envisioned and remains contentious. The court decision includes a requirement that there must be stringent limits that are \\"scrupulously monitored\\". This will require the death certificate to be completed by an independent medical examiner, not the treating physician, to ensure the accuracy of reporting the cause of death. The Canadian Medical Association (CMA) reported that not all doctors were willing to help a terminally-ill patient die. However, the belief in late 2015 was that no physician would be forced to do so. The CMA also supports the request to the Supreme Court for a six-month extension, said CMA spokesman Dr. Jeff Blackmer, in order to develop educational materials and to train numerous physicians across Canada. However, by late 2015, the CMA had begun to offer educational sessions to members as to the process that would be used. =Bill C-14= As required by the 2015 Supreme Court decision, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould tabled a bill in parliament in April 2016 to amend the Criminal Code to allow medical assistance in dying. Bill C-14 \\"create[s] exemptions from the offences of culpable homicide, of aiding suicide and of administering a noxious thing, in order to permit medical practitioners and nurse practitioners to provide medical assistance in dying and to permit pharmacists and other persons to assist in the process\\". The bill will restrict assisted suicide only to mentally competent adults with \\"enduring and intolerable suffering\\" and in cases where death is \\"reasonably foreseeable\\". It also mandates a 15-day reflection period. =Bill C-14 passes; to become law= After the House of Commons passed Bill C-14 that would allow for doctor-assisted suicide, it was debated in the Senate in mid- June 2016. Initially, that \\"House of sober second thought\\" amended the bill, expanding the right to die. However, when it became apparent that the elected House of Commons would not accept the amendment, a final vote was held on June 18. At that time, a majority agreed with the restrictive wording provided by the House of Commons indicating that \\"only patients suffering from incurable illness whose natural death is 'reasonably foreseeable' are eligible for a medically assisted death\\", as summarized by the Toronto Star. Some opponents to the law indicate that the Carter v. Canada (Attorney General) decision was broader, including desperately ill individuals and not only those who are terminally ill or near death. The House of Commons did accept a few Senate amendments, such as requiring that patients be counselled about alternatives including palliative care and barring beneficiaries from acting in the euthanasia. Senators such as Serge Joyal who disagree with the restrictive wording believe that the provinces should refer the issue to the Supreme Court of Canada for an opinion in order to preclude the need for individuals to proceed with such an Appeal and incur the significant expense of doing so. There was also a debate on the issue of suicide in Indigenous communities with MP Robert-Falcon Ouellette (Liberal) voting against the government on C-14. This was the first instance of a government backbencher voting against their party. Ouellette felt that large scale changes to social norms like assisted dying should move very slowly because the impacts will be felt differently across Canada and societies. \\"While the people of Toronto might want this, the impact in the North will be different. We are not islands unto ourselves.\\" See also * Euthanasia Prevention Coalition * Maurice G√©n√©reux * Gloria Taylor * R. v.

Live specimens have only rarely been observed.(in Dutch language) While it does occur in the Baltic Sea, it has become a vulnerable species there. Feeding habits Epitonium clathrum is a predator of sea anemones (Anthozoa, Actiniaria) and corals (Anthozoa, Scleractinia). It has been seen feeding on the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata and found in the neighbourhood of sea anemones Sagartia troglodytes and Sargartiogeton undatus. Description Shell: The cone-shaped shell reaches a height of 35 mm. It is shiny white to cream coloured, often with brown spots. Seven thick and very distinct costae (spiral ribs) wind around twelve to fifteen whorls. These convex whorls often contain two or three purple bands that can best seen when they cross the lamella of the outer lip. The protoconch is usually blunt. The aperture is entire and rounded. Its top coincides with a suture. The umbilicus is lacking. The operculum is horny and paucispiral. Soft parts (data compiled from George Washington Tryon (1887) and Johannes Thiele (1929)): The short foot is truncated in front and extends far in advance of the head. The long tentacles are narrow and close together. The eyes are situated on the base of the tentacles. The mantle margin is simple and contains a rudimentary siphonal fold. The radula is wide and more or less bent at the end. The radular teeth are elongate and hook shaped or needle shaped, with many teeth in a series. The species is hermaphroditic.

The majority of the Unisys software is included in the subsystems and applications area of the model. For example, the database managers are subsystems and the compilers are applications.  System Basics  400px The details of the system architecture are covered in Unisys publication 3850 7802 Instruction Processor Programming Reference Manual. Also see UNIVAC 1100/2200 series. The 1100 Series has used a 36-bit word with 6-bit characters since 1962. This word and character size was a Department of Defense (DoD) requirement. Since the military needed to be able to calculate accurate trajectories, design bridges, and perform other engineering and scientific calculations, they needed more than 32 bits of precision. A 32-bit floating point number only provided about 6 digits of accuracy while a 36 bit number provided the 8 digits of accuracy that were accepted as the minimum requirement. Since memory and storage space and costs drove the system, going to 64 bits was simply not acceptable in general. These systems use ones' complement arithmetic, which was not unusual at the time. Almost all computer manufacturers of the time delivered 36-bit systems with 6-bit characters including IBM, DEC, General Electric, and Sylvania. The 6-bit character set used by the 1100 Series is also a DoD mandated set. It was defined by the Army Signal Corps and called Fieldata (data returned from the field).Watts S. Humphrey, \\"MOBIDIC and Fieldata,\\" IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, vol. 9, no. 2, pp. 137-182, Apr.-June 1987, . http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MAHC.1987.10018 The 1108 provided a 9-bit character format in order to support ASCII and later the ISO 8-bit sets, but they were not extensively used until the 1980s again because of space constraints. The 2200 Series architecture provides many registers. Base registers logically contain a virtual address that points to a word in a code or data bank (segment). They may point to the beginning of the bank or to any word within the bank. Index registers are used by instructions to modify the offset of the specified or assumed base register. Simple arithmetic (add, subtract) may be performed on all index registers. In addition, index registers consist of a lower offset portion and an upper increment portion. An instruction may both use the offset value in an index register as part of an address and specify that the increment is to be added to the offset. This allows loops to be accomplished with fewer instructions as incrementing the index by the step size can be accomplished without a separate instruction. Arithmetic registers allow the full set of computational instructions including all floating point operations. Some of those instructions work on adjacent pairs of registers to perform double-precision operations. There are no even-odd constraints. Any two registers may be used as a double-precision value. Four of the arithmetic registers are also index registers (the sets overlap ‚Äì index register X12 is arithmetic register A0). This allows the full range of calculations to be performed on indexes without having to move the results. The rest of the registers, known as R registers, are used as fast temporary storage and for certain special functions. R1 holds the repeat count for those instructions that may be repeated (block transfer, execute repeated, etc.). R2 holds a bit mask for a few instructions that perform a bitwise logical operation in addition to some other functions (e.g., masked load upper) There are two full sets of registers (A, X, R, and B). One set, the user registers, is used by all applications and most portions of the operating system. It is saved and restored as part of activity (thread) state. The other set, the Exec registers, is used by interrupt processing routines and some other portions of the operating system that want to avoid having to save and restore user registers. The Exec registers are not writable by user applications although some user code can read them. As a result, the Exec is carefully designed never to leave private, secure, or confidential information in registers. Instruction interpretation chooses the appropriate register set to use based on a bit in the Processor State Register. This bit is always set (changed to privileged) on an interrupt. All registers are also visible in the address space, but the Exec portion is protected and a reference by non- privileged code will result in a fault interrupt. The 2200 Series uses a 36-bit segmented virtual address space. We‚Äôll look later at the addressing architecture. The 2200 Series is a CISC architecture system. Not only are there a large number of instructions (current count is about 245) but many of them have addressing variants. Some of the variants are encoded directly in the instruction format (partial word references) and some are dependent on Processor State Register settings. Many instructions also perform very complex functions such as one that implements a large part of the COBOL EDIT verb. 400px The above figure shows some of the building blocks of the architecture. \\"Data\\" and \\"COMM\\" are two of the primary examples of software subsystems that live in a protection ring between that of a user application and the Exec. There are many other such subsystems and users write their own.  Memory and Addressing  thumb = Level = As was mentioned earlier the 2200 Series uses a 36-bit segmented virtual address. The original notion of a segmented space came from the earliest implementation that emphasized code and data separation for performance and the use of shared code banks. Over the years this expanded to provide greater flexibility of levels of sharing and far greater protection for security and reliability. Controlled access to shared data was also introduced. A virtual address consists of three parts. The high- order 3 bits define the sharing level. This is the heart of the entire addressing and protection scheme. Every thread has eight Bank Descriptor Tables (Segment Descriptor Tables in the industry) based on B16-B23. The tables are indexed by level ‚Äì level 0 refers to the Bank Descriptor Table (BDT) based on B16, level 2 the BDT based on B18, etc. The level 0 and level 2 BDTs are common to all threads in the system. Every run (process) has its own level 4 BDT, and that BDT is common to all threads in the run. Every user thread has its own unshared level 6 BDT.  Activity  Each extended-mode activity (thread) always has six banks, segments, which are totally unique to it. One is the Return Control Stack which holds information about the calling structure including any security relevant privilege and state changes. It is not accessible by the thread except through the use of the CALL, RETURN, and similar instructions. This is a major part of the protection and reliability mechanism. Applications cannot cause bad effects by changing the return addresses or overwriting the return control stack.Unisys Corporation (2013). _Exec System Software Executive Requests Programming Reference Manual_. (Unisys publication 7830 7899). Roseville, MN. http://public.support.unisys.com/2200/docs/cp14.0/pdf/78307899-022.pdf Another unique bank is the automatic storage bank (Activity Local Store stack). This is used by the compilers to hold local variables created within a block. It is also used to hold all parameter lists passed on a call. One of the checks made by the operating system both on its own behalf and when a call is made to a protected subsystem is to ensure that the operands are on the thread-local stack and that the thread has the right to access the memory region referenced by any parameters. Because the parameters are kept in thread-local space, there is no chance that some other thread may change them during or after validation. It is the responsibility of the called procedure to perform similar checks on any secondary parameters that may exist in shared space (i.e., the primary parameter points to a structure that contains pointers). The procedure is expected to copy any such pointers to its own local space before validating them and then to use only that internally held validated pointer. Activities may create additional segments up to the limit of the available address space (233 words = 8GW or about 36GB). This is a convenient way for multi-threaded applications to get large amounts of memory space knowing that it is totally thread-safe and that they are not taking any space away from the rest of what is available to the program. Each activity in a program has its own independent space meaning an application with say 100 activities is able to use over 800GW (>3TB) of virtual space. Basic-mode activities do not start out with any such banks as basic-mode programs are not aware of the virtual address space, but any calls to extended-mode subsystems will cause those banks to be created.  Programs  OS 2200 does not implement programs in exactly the same way that UNIX, Linux, and Windows implement processes, but that is the closest analogy. The most obvious difference is that OS 2200 only permits a single program per Run (Job, Session) to be executing at a time. A program may have hundreds of threads, but cannot spawn other programs to run concurrently. There are several banks at the Program level that contain a mixture of Run (job, session) information and program information. These are control structures for the operating system. They have no access or read-only access for the program. Programs may retrieve information from some of these structures for debugging purposes or to retrieve things like the user-id and terminal-id without the overhead of a system call. They cannot be written by the program. They contain things like the thread state save areas, file control blocks, and accounting information. The rest of the banks are used by the program. When a program object file is executed, the operating system obtains the bank information from the file and creates banks as needed and loads the bank initial state from the file. The simplest program has a single bank containing code and data. This is considered very bad form, but is permitted for compatibility with old applications. You can only create such an application with assembly language. The standard compilers create one or more code banks and one or more data banks. Normally the code banks are marked as read-only as a debugging and reliability aid. There are no security concerns either way. The program can only affect itself. Each program thus has its own address space distinct from all other programs in the system. Nothing a program can do can change the contents of any other program‚Äôs memory. The OS and shared subsystems are protected by other mechanisms which will be discussed later. Even read access is prohibited to OS and subsystem memory in almost all cases from code in a program. It is possible to create a shared subsystem which is generally readable, or even writable, by multiple programs, but it must be explicitly installed that way by a privileged system administrator. Programs are initially created with just the banks specified in the object file and with a single activity. They may use system calls to create additional banks within their own program level and additional activities.  Subsystems  The closest analogy to a shared subsystem is a .dll. A subsystem is much like a program in many respects except that it does not have any activities associated with it. Instead it is accessed by other programs and subsystems typically via a CALL instruction. In fact, a program is a subsystem plus one or more activities. Every activity belongs to a \\"home\\" subsystem which is the program that created it. This subsystem concept is important as an encapsulation of access rights and privilege. Within their home subsystem, activities typically share common access rights to code and data banks. Code banks in the home subsystem are usually read-only, or even execute-only if they contain no constant data, but all activities will have the right to execute them.Unisys Corporation (2012). _Linking System Subsystems Programming Guide_. (Unisys publication 7830 7451). Roseville, MN. http://public.support.unisys.com/2200/docs/cp14.0/pdf/78307451-015.pdf Subsystems are also combinations of banks and may contain data banks as well as code banks. All globally shared subsystems must be installed in the system by someone with appropriate administrator privileges. Subsystems may also open files. The Database manager is a subsystem which opens all the database files for its use typically with exclusive access rights. The operating system will attach its own banks to a subsystem to hold the file control tables.  OS  The OS level contains the banks of the Exec. These banks are never directly accessible by either programs or global subsystems. Entry points to the OS are all handled in the same way as a protected subsystem. Calls made to the OS are always via \\"gates,\\" instructions that exist for that purpose (ER = Executive Request), or via interrupts. = The Bank Descriptor Index (BDI) = thumb The next part of the virtual address is the BDI or Bank Descriptor Index. The Level field selected a particular bank descriptor table base register (B16-B23). Base registers B16-B23 are part of the activity state and are maintained by the Exec with no direct access by the activity. The Bank Descriptor tables for the program and activity levels exist within the program-level banks that belong to the operating system. The BDI is simply an index into a Bank Descriptor Table. Each entry in the table contains information about a bank. Each such entry describes up to 1MB (256KW) of virtual address space. When a larger contiguous space is needed, consecutive entries are logically combined to create a larger bank up to the maximum of 230 words. The Bank Descriptor Table Entry (Bank Descriptor ‚Äì BD) gives the size of the bank (small = up to 256KW, large = up to 16MW, very large = up to 1GW). A small bank is always represented by a single BD. Large banks are represented by up to 64 consecutive BDs and a very large bank by up to 4096 BDs. Large and very large banks need not use all 64 or 4096 consecutive BDs. They only use as many as needed to provide the virtual address space required. The entry also contains upper and lower limits of allowable offsets within the bank. Virtual addresses that are outside the limits generate a fault interrupt. This allows small banks, for example containing a message, to have only the virtual space reserved for it that it actually needs and provides a debugging check against bad pointers and indices. The BD also contains a key value and access control fields. The fields indicate whether read, write, or execute permission is granted to the instruction processor (3 bits). The Special Access Permissions (SAP) applies only to activities executing within the owning subsystem (really only those with a matching key value). The General Access Permissions (GAP) applies to everyone else and is usually zero (no access). The Exec sets a key value in the state of each activity which may be changed by gate and interrupt transitions.  Protection Mechanisms  thumb thumb The 2200 Series protection architecture uses three pieces of activity state that are reflected in the hardware state. They are Processor Privilege (PP), Ring, and Domain. Processor Privilege controls the ability to execute privileged instructions and access protected registers and other state. PP=0 is used by the Exec and gives full access to all instructions and privileged state. Exec activities and user activities that have used a gate to access an Exec API run at PP=0. PP=1 restricts most privileged instructions but does allow reading of the day clocks and reading the contents of some of the privileged registers. None of the privileged registers contain any truly sensitive information, but allowing general read access could easily lead to undetected errors in user programs. Basically at PP=1, instructions that can change the addressing environment, change the clocks, change instrumentation state, or perform I/O are all restricted. PP=1 is rarely used. PP=2 is the normal user mode and is state in which all other code executes. It is a further restriction of PP=1. There is also a PP=3 which further restricts the instructions a user program can execute, but it is not currently in use as too many existing programs were using some of those instructions. The intent was to restrict access to instructions that may be system model dependent. The Domain mechanism is the heart of the protection mechanism. Each BD (bank descriptor) has a lock field consisting of a ring number and domain number. There is also a key field in the state of each activity. If the key matches the lock or the ring in the key is less than the ring in the lock, the activity has Special Access Permission. Otherwise, the activity has General Access Permission. Ring allows overriding the Domain protection mechanism. User applications run at Ring=3. Protected subsystems run at Ring=2. This gives them access to their own data while still allowing them to access parameters and data in the calling user‚Äôs space. Note that it is still not possible for a thread to cause the protected subsystem to access some other user‚Äôs space as only this thread‚Äôs Bank Descriptor Tables are in use. Ring=0 is used by the OS and allows it to access its own data while still being able to access parameters passed from either user programs or protected subsystems. Gates are another part of the protection mechanism. A gate is a data structure that controls transitions between domains. A gate lives in a gate bank and the hardware enforces that all references to gates must be to addresses at a proper offset (multiple of a gate size) within a gate bank. A gate contains the target address, new values for PP, Ring, and Domain, and may contain a hidden parameter to be passed to the target. Protected subsystems are not directly accessible to other subsystems. Instead a subsystem must request that a gate be built in its gate bank for access to that subsystem. This permits the operating system to perform any access control checks. The linking system will then find the gate address associated with an entry point. In fact, the whole mechanism is usually transparently handled within the linking system. The hidden parameter permits, for example, a file I/O gate to contain the address or handle of the file control block. Since this is guaranteed to be correct as it was created by the OS when the user opened the file, many error checks can be eliminated from the path length to do I/O.  Instruction Processors  thumb OS 2200 is designed to handle up to 32 instruction processors (or CPUs). A great deal of design has been done over the years optimize for this environment. For example, OS 2200 makes almost no use of critical sections in its design. There‚Äôs too high a probability of multiple processors executing the same code. Instead it uses data locking on the finest granularity data possible. Generally locks deal with a single instance of a data object (e.g., activity control structure or file control block) and are contained within the data structure of the object. This minimizes the likelihood of conflicts. When more global locks have to be set as when updating a list of objects, the lock is set only as long as it takes to update the links in the list. Even dispatching is done with separate locks for different priority levels. A check can be made for an empty priority level without setting a lock. The lock need only be set when adding or removing an item from the queue. The register set is in the visible address space. Registers appear to exist in the first 128 words (2008) of the current instruction bank (B0) when referenced as a data item. This does impose a restriction on compilers to not place any data constants in the first 128 words of a code bank. The result of this is an expansion of the instruction set without requiring additional operation codes. Register-to-register operations are accomplished with the register-storage operation codes. right Typical instructions contain a function code, the target (or source) register, an index register, a base register and a displacement field. When the function code with its qualifier indicates immediate data, the displacement, base, i, and h fields combine to form a single 18-bit immediate value. This allows loading, adding, multiplying, etc. by small constants to eliminate a memory reference and the associated storage. right Processor state as captured on a stack at an interrupt contains the information needed to both return control to the interrupted activity and to determine the type of the interrupt. Interrupts may occur in the middle of long instructions and the state deals with that possibility. right Basic mode is another whole form of instruction formats and addressing. Basic mode provides compatibility with previous systems back to the 1108. For all practical purposes, the hardware architecture defines the rules by which addresses and instructions are converted to the above forms. The most obvious difference in basic mode is the lack of explicit B registers in instructions. Instead there are four implicitly used B registers (B12-B15). There is a complex algorithm using the limits of the banks represented by those B registers, the operand address and the B register within which the current instruction is found. right The most interesting instructions in the 2200 repertoire are the locking and synchronization instructions. Conditional replace is familiar and quite similar to Compare and Swap in the Intel architecture. These instructions always gain exclusive use of the memory/cache-line holding the referenced word. TS and TSS check a bit in the referenced word. If the bit is clear, they set it and continue (TS) or skip (TSS). If the bit is set, they either interrupt (TS) or fall through to the next instruction(TSS). On a TS interrupt the OS takes one of several actions depending on the instruction sequence and activity priority. Real time and Exec activities simply get control back to allow retry unless there is an even higher-priority activity waiting. The presumption is that the lock is set on another processor and will soon be cleared. If it is a user activity not running at real time priority, it may have its priority temporarily reduced and be placed back in the dispatching queues. Alternatively, the code sequence may indicate that Test & Set Queuing is being used. In this case, the OS places the activity in a wait state and chains it to the end of the list of activities waiting for that particular lock. Activities clearing such a lock check to see if any are waiting and if so notify the OS to allow one of more to try again. Test & Set Queuing is typically used for synchronization within subsystems such as the database manager where activities from many programs may be executing. The result of these mechanisms is very efficient, low overhead, synchronization among activities. right The queuing architecture is another interesting special case. It was specifically designed to allow very efficient handling of messaging where the number of messages waiting for processing could be almost unlimited. It is also aimed at reducing one of the primary costs of messaging, namely having to constantly move messages around in memory. Even moving them from the communication manager to the message queue subsystem to the processing program is eliminated. Instead each message is placed in a small bank of its own. Instructions allow placing the bank descriptors of these banks in a queue and removing them from a queue. When a message is placed in a queue, the sending program or subsystem no longer has any access to it. That bank is removed from its address space. When a message is retrieved from a queue, the bank becomes part of the receiver's address space. The queuing instructions also provide activity synchronization functions (e.g., wait for a message). Only \\"pointers\\" are moved and they are moved in a way that ensures security and integrity. Once moved, the data in the message is only visible to the recipient.  I/O Processors  All I/O on 2200 Series systems is handled by I/O processors. These processors offload large portions of the I/O path length and recovery, and by fully isolating the main system from I/O faults, interrupts, bus errors, etc. greatly improve reliability and availability. The I/O processors come in three different types (Storage, Communications, Clustering) but the only real difference is the firmware load.Unisys Corporation (2012). _ClearPath Dorado 300/400/700/800/4000/4100/4200 Server I/O Planning Guide_. (Unisys publication 3839 6586). Roseville, MN. http://public.support.unisys.com/2200/docs/cp14.0/pdf/38396586-010.pdf All I/O processors are controlled by the operating system. OS 2200 does provide a raw mode for I/O called \\"arbitrary device I/O,\\" but even there the OS validates that the program is accessing an allowed device and handles all interrupts and faults before passing appropriate status on to the program. Programs must be granted privileges by the security officer to access devices in arbitrary mode and that may be limited by both the security officer and the system operator to specific devices. Arbitrary I/O is not allowed to a device that is also in use by any other program or the system. The device must be exclusively allocated to the program. The OS takes very general calls from programs and generates command packets with real memory and device addresses which are then passed to the I/O processor. Firmware in the I/O processor actually creates the device specific (e.g., SCSI) packets, sets up the DMA, issues the I/O, and services the interrupts.

In 1944‚Äì1950 he was the Soviet consul to Egypt. He served as the Soviet envoy to Lebanon and Syria. In 1953‚Äì1956 he returned to Egypt, as the Soviet envoy (becoming ambassador in 1954). Returning from Egypt, he was put in charge of the Near East department at the Soviet Foreign Ministry.Alan, Ray. Stirrings in Araby: Tribal Feuds and World Politics Between 1959 and 1962 he was the Soviet ambassador to Guinea. After returning from Guinea, he worked at the Africa Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR until 1970.Oƒçerki istorii Ministerstva Inostrannych Del Rossii 1917 - 2002 gg. 2. Moscow: Olma-press, 2002. p. 374 In Egypt Solod served as the Soviet envoy to Egypt in run-up to the 1956 Suez Crisis, and held discussions with Gamal Abdul Nasser regardings arms imports from the Soviet Union. Solod also maintained contacts with the Egyptian government in discussions on Soviet aid to the construction of Aswan Dam.Rubin, Neville N., and William M. Warren.

Albany: State University of New York Press, 1984. pp. 29, 43 Apart from the contacts with the Egyptian government, he also maintained contacts with local communists. From 1955 onwards, he advised Egyptian communists to recognize Nasser as a 'bourgeois nationalist'. In Guinea Solod was appointed ambassador to Guinea on December 30, 1959. He succeeded Pavel Gerasimov. However, Solod's stay in Guinea was terminated by a diplomatic crisis between the two states. In November 1961 the Guinean president Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© accused Solod of being involved in the so-called 'teachers' plot' (an alleged coup attempt by radical elements of the teachers' union). During a diplomatic reception in Conakry, Tour√©'s presidential protocol officer pulled Solod out and directed him to immediately go to the Guinean Foreign Ministry. At the Foreign Ministry, he was informed that he was persona non grata in Guinea and that he had to leave the country at once. Solod's actual role in the alleged plot is believed to have been very marginal.Stevens, Chris. Africa and the Soviet Union, in International Relations 1971; 3; 1014 In January 1962 the Soviet Union sent a new ambassador to Guinea, Dmitry Degtyar. Although the Soviet Union tried to downplay the rift between the two states after Solod's departure, the Solod affair contributed to a weakening of Soviet-Guinean relations and an opening for increased links between Guinea and the People's Republic of China.Klinghoffer, Arthur Jay.

Compared to other modern treaty agreements, the land offer was 1.92% of their traditional land base by area, much lower than the 5% benchmark set by other agreements. In addition to the land concerns, there were many other factors that have stirred much controversy over the ability of the final agreement to achieve the desired objectives. For example, the agreement references the Puchil dialect of the Nlaka'pamux Nation, but many members of the community speak Halq'emeylem which is a Coast Salish language.

The 2001 Census recorded its population as 63. In the 2011 census the population was not separately counted, but included with the neighbouring parish of Kelmscott. Manor In the late Anglo-Saxon era Little Faringdon was part of a large estate that included Faringdon (formally Great Faringdon), from which it took its name. The manor was one of several in the area granted to the Cistercian Beaulieu Abbey as part of its Faringdon estate by a charter of 1204 or 1205. Beaulieu held its estates until it had to surrender them to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. The manor was then held by the Bourchier and Perrott families. In about 1860 it was sold to Charles Ponsonby, 2nd Baron de Mauley, whose descendants hold it today. Until the 20th century Little Faringdon was an estate village. In 1910 the lord of the manor owned almost all the houses. Local government Little Faringdon was historically a township of the parish of Langford, which until the 13th century was in Oxfordshire. For the next six centuries it was an exclave of Berkshire, until the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 returned it to Oxfordshire. In 1864 Little Faringdon was made a separate ecclesiastical parish and in 1866 a separate civil parish. Since the 1974 boundary changes it has been part of West Oxfordshire District. The parish has a parish meeting, but no parish council. Parish church The parish church is Norman, built in the 12th century as a dependent chapelry of Langford. It has Norman lancet windows in the chancel. In about 1200 the church was enlarged with the addition of a north aisle. The arcade between the nave and north aisle is in a transitional style between Norman and Early English Gothic. In the 14th century the porch and south door were added. A south aisle seems to have been added at about the same time but has since been lost. In about 1500 two Perpendicular Gothic clerestory windows were added to south side of the nave. The west window of the nave is also a late Medieval Perpendicular Gothic addition. The church became the parish church when Little Faringdon became a separate parish in 1864. The vicarage to the south of the church was designed by the Gothic Revival architect William Butterfield and completed in 1867. The church's original dedication is unknown. In 2000 it was dedicated to St Margaret of England. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The parish is now part of the Benefice of Shill Valley and Broadshire, which includes also the parishes of Alvescot, Black Bourton, Broadwell, Broughton Poggs, Filkins, Holwell, Kelmscott, Kencot, Langford, Shilton and Westwell.

Its success in France led to two more albums and two novels. In 2009 a spectacular adaptation combining material from the first two albums was performed in Germany under the English title Excalibur: the Celtic Rock Opera, with great success. It was extended with material from the third album in 2011. The Excalibur trilogy The first part of an intended trilogy, Excalibur, La l√©gende des Celtes blended musical styles and was performed by Roger Hodgson (Supertramp), Fairport Convention, Dan Ar Braz, Tri Yann, Angelo Branduardi, Didier Lockwood, Gabriel Yacoub. The story is based on the legend of King Arthur. Narration is led by Merlin.Elizabeth Sherr Sklar, Donald L. Hoffman, King Arthur in popular culture, McFarland, 2002, p.151. It is structured as a series of songs and instrumental interludes linked by narration, covering the birth of Arthur, the creation of Excalibur, his victory over the pagans, the rebellion of Morgana and Mordred, the search for the Holy Grail, and Arthur's final defeat and trip to Avalon. Most songs are sung in English, though some are in French and the central song, representing the triumph of Arthur and creation of Camelot, is an arrangement of a traditional Breton language folk song. A voice-over narrates events in French. Within weeks, the album went gold in France (Top 10). Five concert performances took place between October 1999 and June 2000, including one at Paris-Bercy. A live recording, released as Excalibur, le concert mythique (\\"Excalibur, the legendary concert\\") (CD and DVD) was recorded at the first concert in Rennes on 12 October 1999. In 2007 Simon released the second part of Excalibur, Excalibur II, l'anneau des Celtes (\\"Excalibur II: The Celtic Ring\\") with contributions from Jon Anderson (Yes), Alan Parsons, Barclay James Harvest, Maddy Prior, Jacqui McShee, John Wetton (King Crimson / Asia), Justin Hayward (The Moody Blues), Flook, Karan Casey, Fairport Convention, Andreas Vollenweider and Martin Barre. The second part creates a mytho-history of the time before Arthur, describing the birth of Merlin after the loss of the happy land of Anwynn, portrayed as a physical fusion of Britain and Ireland. The emergence of the \\"Formeriis\\", demonic barbarians from the earth, violates the perfection of Anwynn. Various Celtic mythical figures are introduced, including Lugh, Bran and Saint Brendan. Merlin and Uther Pendragon struggle to restore order and defeat the Formeriis invasion of Anwynn.Exaclibur II, liner notes. It is sung entirely in English. The third part of the trilogy, \\"The Origins\\", was released in early 2012. According to Simon, it describes the origins of the proto-human \\"Formeriis\\", in his own take on Celtic myth.Simon's Excalibur trilogy website Like the second part, it is sung in English interspersed with incantatory fragments of Gaelic, Brythonic and wordless chanting. Simon has also written two novels on the story, Excalibur, le cercle de Dragon (Excalibur, the circle of Dragon), was released in March 2008. A second volume was published in October 2009 called Excalibur, la proph√©tie de Merlin (Excalibur, The prophecy of Merlin).

The implementation as a subsystem means that there is no upper limit to the potential concurrency of activities (threads) executing in the database manager. The thread of each user executes the database manager code but within its protection domain so that misbehaved and malicious programs cannot affect the integrity of the database. This approach also reduces the path lengths and overhead involved as messages do not have to be sent between the caller and the database manager. All communication is through parameters. This commonality has made it possible for clients to modernize applications moving from language files, to a network database, to a relational database. They can use a mixture of these at the same time in a single program while retaining full recoverability. With all the recovery, clustering, locking, and cache management centralized, applications do not have to deal with those aspects. In OS 2200 locking is generally implicit in the database verbs used. For example, a read-for-update implies setting a certain type of lock and the corresponding update write implies clearing it. The database managers support access using many common distributed data access protocols and APIs including JDBC, OLE DB, and ODBC. See also Unisys OS 2200 distributed processing. center The heart of the database and transaction system is Integrated Recovery. ‚ÄúIntegrated‚Äù implies the integration of all data models, the transaction file manager, the transaction scheduler, and the message queues. All activity in all of these areas is journaled (written to the audit trail). The audit trail is managed by the Exec which ensures synchronization for all users.Unisys Corporation (2010). _Integrated Recovery Conceptual Overview_. (Unisys publication 7830 8186). Roseville, MN. http://public.support.unisys.com/2200/docs/cp14.0/pdf/78308186-004.pdf The Integrated Recovery Utility (IRU) is the heart of the recovery system. It provides database backup synchronized with executing transactions and the audit trails. Transactions and batch applications do not need to be stopped to back up the database. IRU makes that unnecessary. All backups can be performed in a running system. Start-of-backup and complete-backup sentinel blocks are written to the audit trail. IRU uses these blocks and other information on the audit trail to perform the fastest possible recovery operations. There are three main types of recovery actions. All are designed to work across clustered systems. Short recovery is normally used when an application or system failure necessitates performing recovery. Most transactional updates are not written to the database files on disk until the transaction completes successfully and instead are kept in memory or in a roll-forward file. Recovery then means indicating which transactions were in progress and need to be re-scheduled. Transactions that had completed but whose data was not yet written to disk have their data written to the disk files. Recovery to a point in time is most often used when an application update with errors was inserted in the system or a human mistake has partially corrupted the database. The IRU may be told to simply take all the state back to a previous time. A full recovery is used when a catastrophic failure has caused loss of some or all of the mass storage holding the database. Affected files are reloaded from the last backup and appropriated updates are applied from the audit trail files.

It is also found on Fiji, Samoa, and the Marquesas however these populations are likely to be human introductions. This species is found in tropical dry forests.  Description  This species reaches a height of , with a smooth, grayish tan trunk in diameter. The 20‚Äì30 leaves are wide and equally long, held on petioles in length. The large, flat and rounded leaves are divided 1/4-1/3 into many stiff-tipped segments. The inflorescences are composed of 1-4 panicles, shorter than or equalling the petioles in length. The panicles are branched to 2 orders, with glabrous rachillae. The flowers are followed by small, shiny dark brown to purplish black, spherical fruits, in diameter. Pritchardia pacifica is considered a host for a plant disease called Lethal Yellowing that is found in Florida, Puerto Rico, and Guam.  Cultivation and uses  In Fiji the leaves of Fiji fan palm were traditionally used as fans, known as Iri masei or Ai viu, that were only used by the chiefs. A light, flexible wood was used to construct a border for the leaves. In Fijian, the term Ai viu refers to both a fan and an umbrella, as the leaves of Fiji fan palm were used for protection from both the sun and the rain. The leaf was held immediately above the head when it was raining in order and the rain rolled off the leaf behind the head. The trunk of this species was occasionally used for ridge-beams. This species was associated with the upper classes and only one or two trees were usually found in a village, as these plants provided enough leaves to meet the material needs of the village chiefs. This species is sought after by palm enthusiasts for cultivation and is widely grown as an ornamental plant throughout the Pacific. The fresh seed germinates well in high light environments with moist but well drained soil. The plants tolerate coastal spray. Image:Pritchardia_pacifica.jpg Mature trees.

Speakman's critique of the thrifty gene hypothesis is based on an analysis of the pattern and level of mortality during famines. Despite much anecdotal evidence used to suggest that famines cause substantial mortality, Speakman suggests that where real data are available famines actually involve rather low levels of mortality and there is no evidence that fat people survive famines better than lean people. In fact mortality actually falls mostly on groups such as the very young and very old where differential mortality in relation to body composition is highly unlikely. Moreover, there is some confusion among proponents of the thrifty gene hypothesis about how long famines have played a role in evolution. On the one hand some proponents suggest famines have been an \\"ever present\\" threat dating back to the dawn of Australopithecines about 4‚Äì6 million years ago, while others indicate that famines may actually only have been important since the invention of agriculture, because crop failures would exert devastating effects on our ancestors. Speakman argues that either scenario poses difficulties. If we have been under intense selection for the past 6 million years then simple calculations of the spread of favorable alelles under positive selection, known since the 1920s, indicate that we should all be obese and diabetic, which we clearly are not. However, if selection has only been acting for the past 15,000 years then there has been insufficient time for thrifty genes to spread at all. It is argued instead that the modern distribution of the obese phenotype likely comes about because of genetic drift in the genes encoding the regulation system controlling an upper limit on our body fatness. Hence the name \\"drifty\\" genes, to contrast the positively selected \\"thrifty genes\\". Such drift may have started because around 2 million years ago when ancestral humans effectively removed the risk of predation, which was probably a key factor maintaining the upper boundary of the regulation system. The drifty gene hypothesis was presented as part of a presidential debate at the 2007 Obesity Society meeting in New Orleans, with the counter-arguments favoring the thrifty gene hypothesis presented by British nutritionist Andrew Prentice. The main thrust of Prentice's argument against the drifty gene idea is that Speakman's critique of the thrifty gene hypothesis ignores the huge impact that famines have on fertility. It is argued by Prentice that while famine may actually have only been a force driving evolution of thrifty genes for the past 15,000 years or so, because famines exert effects on both survival and fertility the selection pressure may have been sufficient even over such a short timescale to generate the current phenotype distribution of BMI. This critique was published back-to-back with the original 'drifty gene' paper in the International Journal of Obesity in November 2008. Prentice et al predicted that the emerging molecular genetics field would ultimately provide a way to test between the adaptive 'thrifty gene' idea and the non-adaptive 'drifty gene' idea because it would be possible to find signatures of positive selection in the human genome, at genes that are linked to both obesity and type 2 diabetes, if the 'thrifty gene' hypothesis is correct. Two comprehensive studies have been performed seeking such signatures of selection. Ayub et al (2015) searched for signatures of positive selection at 65 genes linked to type 2 diabetes, and Wang and Speakman (2016) searched for signatures of selection at 115 genes linked to obesity. In both cases there was no evidence for such selection signatures at a higher rate than in random genes selected for matched GC content and recombination rate. These two papers provide strong evidence against the thrifty gene idea, and indeed against any adaptive explanation which relies on selection during our recent evolutionary history, but instead provide strong support the 'drifty gene' interpretation.

Life He was born in London on 22 June 1656, the only surviving son of John Nelson, a merchant in the Turkey trade, by Delicia, daughter of Sir Lewis and sister of Sir Gabriel Roberts, who, like John Nelson, were members of the Levant Company. John Nelson died on 4 September 1657, leaving a good fortune to his son. His mother sent Robert for a time to St Paul's School, but then took him home. She settled at Driffield Gloucestershire, the home of her sister Anne, wife of George Hanger, also a member of the Levant Company. Here George Bull, then rector of Siddington in the neighbourhood, acted as his tutor. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as fellow commoner in 1678, but never resided.He is not listed in Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses. As early as 1680 he began an affectionate correspondence with John Tillotson, who was a friend of Sir Gabriel Roberts. He was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society on 1 April 1680. He then went to Paris, accompanied by his schoolfellow, Edmund Halley, and afterwards made the grand tour, returning in August 1682. During his travels he met at Rome Lady Theophila Lucy, widow of Sir Kingsmill Lucy, 2nd Baronet, of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, and second daughter of George Berkeley, 1st Earl of Berkeley. She had a son twelve years old by her first husband, and was two years Nelson's senior. He married her on 23 November 1682, the marriage having been postponed for a time in consequence of the elopement of her sister with Lord Grey of Werke. She had, it is said, been converted to Catholicism at Rome by Cardinal Philip Howard, and Nelson was not aware of this until after their marriage; but it may have been later. A Discourse concerning a Judge of Controversy in matters of Religion, published in 1686, upon the Roman Catholic side of the question, is ascribed to her, and in the next year Nelson wrote against transubstantiation. He took Theophila to Aix-la-Chapelle on account of her health. He left her there during a visit to England in 1688; but the Glorious Revolution made him return to the continent. He travelled, with his wife and her son and daughter by her first marriage, to Rome. He lived for a time at Florence, and corresponded with John Drummond, 1st Earl of Melfort, James II's envoy to the Pope. He was a Jacobite in his sympathies, though not engaged in any active measures. He returned by way of Germany and the Hague to England in 1691, and settled at Blackheath. Tillotson died in his arms on 22 November 1694. He had meanwhile joined the nonjurors. He became very intimate after 1691 with John Kettlewell, the nonjuring divine, and Kettlewell, dying in 1695, made him his executor. It was by Kettlewell's advice that he began the religious writings by which he is best known, and he supplied Francis Lee with materials for Kettlewell's life. Through Kettlewell he came to know George Hickes, and he was soon in close communication with all the nonjuring circle: Henry Dodwell, Jeremy Collier, Charles Leslie, Francis Brokesby, and others. He remained, however, on good terms with many of the clergy of the established church, and took an active part in various charitable enterprises. He supported the religious societies founded by Anthony Horneck, and the allied Societies for the Reformation of Manners, which aimed at enforcing laws for the suppression of vice. He was an active member of the societies started by Dr. Thomas Bray; the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, founded 1698; the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, founded 1701; and the 'Associates of Dr. Bray,' a society which especially aimed at providing parochial libraries. He was active in the movement for establishing charity schools, originally begun by Archbishop Thomas Tenison in the time of James II, and carried on with great success during the reign of Queen Anne. In 1710 he was one of the commissioners appointed by the tory House of Commons to build fifty new churches in London. He had left Blackheath in 1703, and lived in Ormond Street. His mother died at the end of 1703, and his wife on 26 January 1706, leaving her fortune to him. Nelson, with Dodwell and Brokesby, left the nonjurors on the death of William Lloyd, the last of the deprived bishops except Thomas Ken. Ken expressed to Nelson his desire that the schism should end, and Nelson on Easter Day 1710 received the sacrament from his friend John Sharp, the Archbishop of York . He did not join, however, in the prayers for the royal family, and in 1713 he helped to prepare for the press the Jacobite treatise of George Harbin on Hereditary Right. He died at Kensington in the house of his cousin, Delicia, then Mrs. Wolf, daughter of Sir Gabriel Roberts, on 16 January 1715. He was the first person buried at a new cemetery in Lamb's Conduit Fields. A monument was erected on the spot, with a long inscription by George Smalridge, bishop of Bristol. It was restored in 1839, when threatened with demolition by the vestry of St. George the Martyr. Works Nelson became known during the reign of Queen Anne for his religious writings, some of which were circulated by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. On the death of his old tutor George Bull, on 27 February 1710, Nelson undertook to write a life, which appeared in 1713. Nelson had been acquainted with Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet, to whom he had sent Bull's writings, and a letter written to Nelson by Bossuet in 1700 contained the challenge to which Bull replied in a letter published in Hickes's Controversial Letters, 1705. Nelson's investigation, in his life of Bull, of the use made of Bull's work on the Nicene Creed by Samuel Clarke led to a controversy with Clarke in the next year. Nelson's works are: * 'Transubstantiation contrary to Scripture; or the Protestant's Answer to the Seeker's Request,' 1687. * 'The Practice of True Devotion, in relation to the End as well as the Means of Religion, with an Office for the Holy Communion,' 1698 (anon.); 2nd ed. 1715, preface dated 23 August 1708. * 'An earnest Exhortation to Householders to set up the Worship of God in their Families . . .' 1702 (anon.) * 'Companion for the Festivals and Fasts of the Church of England, with Collects and Prayers for each Solemnity,' 1704. In this book, a popular manual of Anglican theology, Nelson was helped by his friends Kettlewell, Lee, Brokesby, and William Cave. In four and a half years ten thousand copies were printed. A thirty-sixth edition appeared in 1826; it was translated into German twice, and Welsh. * 'The whole Duty of a Christian by way of Question and Answer, exactly pursuant to the Method of the Whole Duty of Man, for the use of Charity Schools about London,' 1704 (anon.) * 'The Necessity of Church Communion vindicated from the scandalous Aspersions of a late pamphlet, entituled \\"The Principles of the Protestant Reformation, &c.;,\\"' 1705 (anon.) * 'A Letter to an English Priest of the Roman Communion at Rome,' 1705 (in Hickes's collection of that year). * 'The great Duty of frequenting the Christian Sacrifice,' 1707 (enlarged from the chapter on vigils in 'Companion'). * 'Instructions for those that come to be confirmed by way of Question and Answer,' 1706 (also prefixed to 'Christian Sacrifice' in 1712). * 'The Life of Dr. George Bull . . . with the History of those Controversies in which he engaged, and an Abstract of those fundamental Doctrines which he maintained,' &c.;, 1713. * Letter prefixed to James Knight's anonymous 'Scripture Doctrine of the . . . Trinity, vindicated from the Misrepresentations of Dr. Clarke,' 1714. * 'An Address to Persons of Quality and Estate,' with an appendix of papers, 1715 (reprinted Dublin, 1752), contains many proposals on hospitals, theological colleges, and schools. Nelson also published Thomas √† Kempis's Christian Exercises, Fenelon's Pastoral Letter, and notices in the posthumous works of Kettlewell and Bull.

Distributed Transactions  center  Distributed Data Access  center Access to OS 2200 data can be made from virtually any platform and technology. Similarly, OS 2200 applications can access data on almost any other platform.  Composite Applications  center It is rare to find an application that is written completely in one language with one set of middleware. The languages and middleware continue to evolve and applications adopt new technologies when they best fit the business requirements. That is often dictated by the need to integrate with applications written by partners, clients, suppliers, and third-party software providers. They do not all make the same choices and are in any case evolving as well. A composite application may be created by combining existing transaction logic with different middleware or a front-end written for a specific purpose. Unisys supports the X/Open DTP model (also implemented in Tuxedo) as Open DTP and J2EE. They fully interoperate with each other and with the rest of the system. Two-phase commit processing is supported within the database managers including clustered environments. Connectors are available to other common distributed transaction processing environments.

Publication began in October 1901, superseding Beltaine, an occasional theatre review and publication of the Irish Literary Theatre named for the ancient Irish festival Bealtaine. The National Irish Theatre Society published Samhain.Horatio Sheafe Krans. William Butler Yeats and the Irish Literary Revival, W. Heinemann, 1905. Pg. 185. It has been noted that the two periodicals \\"constitute at once a history and a running critical commentary ‚Ä¶ of the origin and growth of the dramatic activity in Ireland.\\" In the first issue of Samhain, Yeats explained the name change as referring to \\"the old name for the beginning of winter, because our plays this year are in October, and because our Theatre is coming to an end in its present shape.\\" Samhain also published the texts of new plays for a time, but later these were printed in book form as The Abbey Theatre Series. It supported the poetic drama. The magazine was published in Dublin by Sealy, Bryers & Walker, and in London by T. Fisher Unwin. In 1908 Samhain ceased publication.

In the first releases, the Exec II assembler (SLEUTH) and compilers were used. The assembler was quickly replaced with an updated version (ASM) designed specifically for the 1108 computer and Exec 8 but the early compilers continued in use for quite some time.  Universal Compiling System  The modern compiling system for OS 2200 is known as UCS, Universal Compiling System. The UCS architecture uses a common syntax analyzer, separate semantic front ends for each language and a common back-end and optimizer. There is also a common language runtime environment. The UCS system was developed starting in 1969 and initially included PL/I and Pascal. FORTRAN and COBOL were soon added. Ada was added later. The currently supported languages include COBOL, FORTRAN, C, and PLUS. PLUS, Programming Language for Unisys (originally UNIVAC) Systems, is a block structured language somewhat similar to Pascal which it predates.  Legacy compilers  Previous PLUS, COBOL and FORTRAN compilers are also still supported. An even earlier FORTRAN compiler (FORTRAN V), while no longer supported, is still in use for an application developed in the 1960s in that language. Compilers previously existed for ALGOL, Simula, BASIC, Lisp, NELIAC, JOVIAL, and other programming languages that are no longer in use on the ClearPath OS 2200 systems.  Assembler  The assembler, MASM, is heavily used both to obtain the ultimate in efficiency and to implement system calls that are not native to the programming language. Much of the MASM code in current use is a carryover from earlier days when compiler technology was not as advanced and when the machines were much slower and more constrained by memory size than today.  Linking  There are two linking systems used. The collector (@MAP) combines the output relocatable elements of the basic-mode compilers and assemblers into an absolute element which is directly executable. While this linker is intended primarily to support basic mode, the relocatable and absolute elements may contain extended-mode as well. This is often the case when an existing application is enhanced to use extended mode or call extended mode libraries but still contains some basic mode code. The Exec is an example of such a program. The linker (@LINK) is the modern linking environment which combines object modules into a new object module. It provides both static and dynamic linking capabilities. The most common usage is to combine the object modules of a program statically but to allow dynamic linking to libraries.  Java  OS 2200 provides a complete Java environment. center Java on OS 2200 has evolved from an interesting additional capability for small servlets and tools to a full environment capable of handling large applications. The Virtual Machine for the Java Platform on ClearPath OS 2200 JProcessor is a Linux port of the Oracle Corporation Java release. The environment includes a full J2EE application server environment using the Tomcat open source web server from the Apache Software Foundation and the JBoss application server. All of this has been integrated with the OS 2200 security, databases, and recovery environment.

They are indigenous people of Gujarat, India. They are mainly found in Tapi, Surat, Dang, Bharuch, Valsad & Navsari districts of Gujarat and some parts of Maharashtra. They are included in state list of scheduled tribes.https://tribal.nic.in/ST/LatestListofScheduledtribes.pdfhttps://trti.gujarat.gov.in/gamithttps://trti.maharashtra.gov.in/index.php/en/list- of-scheduled-tribes Gamit believe that they belong to The Sun dynasty Rajput community. It is believed that they might have migrated to India via Khaibar Ghat and Bolanghat of Sindh region and then they might have proceeded to Marwad areas. This is supported by the songs of leel sung by old Gamit ladies during Holi festival. They perform 'Pooja' on any social or religious occasions. The first God to be worshiped is the Sun God. All other Gods are worshiped after this. Another school of thought indicates that the word 'Gamit' came from the word 'Gam' - a village. That those who got settled in a village (a Gam) are Gamits. They are also known as Vasava (those who settled). Geographic distribution Gamits are found in the districts of Surat, Bharuch, Valsad and Dangs. In Surat district, they are found in Vyara, Songadh, Uchchal and Nizar talukas. They are known as Gamits or Mavachi. Their sub-tribes are Padvi, Valvi and Vasava. Gamits are believed to be sub-tribe of Bhils. Those Bhils who got settled in a village were known as Gamits. As per the 2001 census, the total population of Gamits was 3,54,362. Of this, 1,76,780 are male and 1,77,582 are female. The percentage of Gamits among total tribal population is 4.74 per cent. Habitations and furnishings Gamits are settled in villages. Their houses are not in a straight line like city chawls. Though they stay in vicinity of each other, they are independently situated. All houses have open space around four walls. Sometimes the houses are built on small hills; and some houses are built at the feet of hills. The building material is clay, cow dung, and paddy grass. Bamboos are used in construction of walls. The roofs are constructed suitable to geographical conditions. Either indigenous or Manglory tiles are used to cover roofs. In modern times, some houses have RCC roofs. Gamits stay in houses owned by them. In their houses, they keep the utensils made from copper, brass, aluminum, steel, clay or glass. Besides, they have some mattresses, cots, kerosene lamp, and wooden stand, drum to store food-grain, a radio, T.V., tape recorder, tin box, steel cupboard, etc. Musical Instruments Their musical instruments are made from leather, metal strings, shankh, Dhan, a pipe, Noly, Pawari, Dobru, Ghonghali, etc. Dress The older generation maintains traditional dress. The children, however, have adopted bush-shirt and half-pant, whereas youth wear shirts and pants. Girls prefer either old-fashioned frocks or modern Punjabi dresses. Men wear pant-shirts and women wear either a Punjabi dress or saree, a blouse and a petty- coat/chaniya. Older people invariably wear a cap. Older women wear sarees in Maharashtra-style, separating both legs from each other with a saree tied down at the back. Ornaments Gamit women are fond of ornaments. They have a (a round, solid necklace) or a chain () in their neck. They have a on the nose, ear-rings in their ears, bangles on their hands, a or bracelet on their arms, , a plain, round ornament gripped on the legs or () with many small silver bells. Males wear a silver (waist-band) around the waist, rings on their fingers, and on their toes. Additionally, several other ornaments are also used. Dialect Gamits speak Gamit language. Their communication is only in Gamit dialect. They are known as 'Gamits of 52 families' and they do not have a fixed formation of speech.https://indiantribalheritage.org/?p=25003 Food and drink They consume food grains of nagli, juwar, rice, maize (for preparing loaf), urad and tuver for pulse-dal and potatoes and onions as vegetables in addition to seasonal vegetables. They also consume chapati and pulses. Usually they consume meat and fish as well as wine and tadi. But those who have joined Bhakti school of religious thought abstain from these items. Education As per the 2001 census, the literacy level among Gamit is 52.91%. Gamits reside in both villages and cities; and therefore they could make use of various Government policies including reservation in education. Religion Gamits are Hindus about 89% and Christian about 11%.https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/16781/IN They believe in Hindu Gods and Goddesses. They also believe in their traditional tribal Gods and Goddesses, for example, Devli Madi, Gaumukh, Dunger Dev, Gowal Dev, and Anaj Dev. They keep vows for some purposes and make occasional pilgrimages. They celebrate the festivals of Gam dev no, Holi, Gowal Dev festival, Vaghdev Mahadev, Dussera, Diwali, and Nano Dev-Moto Dev. Besides those, Gamits have Mahadev, Dussera, Diwali, Nano Dev-Moto Dev, etc. Besides those Gamits, who have converted into Christianity celebrate Christmas with great joy. Occupation Gamits are usually agriculturists. Some people whose land has been seized work as agricultural laborers or other laborers. Educated Gamits seek employment. Some go for animal husbandry and many others work in factories. Caste-Panch In the Gamit community, there is formal or informal caste - panch for controls and regulations in their social dealings. Gamits assemble and constitute the caste-panch for community members to follow rules and regulations. Gamits also have their own written constitution. The Caste- Panch looks after the cases of marriages, remarriages, divorce, education, etc. The cycle of life The life cycle of the Gamit community covers three main phases of life: Birth, marriage and death. =Birth of a Child= There is no custom that the first delivery of the Gamit girl should be at the parents' home. Better facilities and a better place are prioritised. The Dai comes home for five days to give a bath to the new born child. On the fifth day of the birth of a child a 'Pancharo' or on sixth day 'a chhathi' is performed. =Engagement= For betrothal (engagement), the boy's party goes to the girl's house. They meet and if they find the matter suitable, they decide to give 'Piyan' i.e. promise. They may also visit each other's houses to build familiarity. =Marriage= Usually Tuesday or Thursday is considered better for marriage. Pandal is erected for marriage; usually near the house. The people of the community or neighbors assist with this. To invite attendees to a marriage ceremony, rice with Haldi or Kanku are placed on the threshold of a house. This is symbolic suggestion. Nowadays, this is accompanied by a printed invitation card. The marriage is performed both traditionally as well as according to Hindu customs with a Brahmin performing it. The Brahmin's role is a traditional as well as Hindu custom. Dinner follows marriage. This community believes in the customs of Aana, Khandhad marriage, love marriage, to marry a sister of a wife upon the wife's death (salivatu) or to marry a younger brother of husband, if the husband dies (Diyarvatu), polygamy, and remarriage after divorce. =Divorce= No divorce in this community can be given within three years of married life and no sexual relations can be kept while the spouse is living, nor a marriage with anybody is permitted. Those who disobey this rule are liable for a Rs. 351/- fine. In case the dispute is not resolved, one can approach the court. =Remarriage= A Gamit widow is permitted to remarry in the following circumstances: If a widow has a child, Rs. 32/- are to be given. All the marriages are registered in a book along with signature of both the parties. =Death= If a death occurs in a Gamit family, the body is kept near a grinding stone with the head pointed north and the legs, south. The drum is played in a peculiar way to announce the death. People come and cry. A dead body can either be cremated or buried. A child's body is buried. Ambli, Babool and Tick woods are used for cremation. The person carrying the fire-pot before the funeral pyre is a special person in a village. The ornaments from the body of a dead person are removed. The dead body is taken to a river bank; the family members move around a dead body for seven times. The mouth of a dead body is cleansed with a Khakhra brush and served curd, Khichdi, wine, etc. with turned hand. Then it is kept on the death-bed which is set aflame by relatives. Then they take bath at the river or a well. After they return home from the crematorium, they sit a little distance from the deceased's house; again the 'Tur' instrument is, played. Those who went at crematorium are served with sugar and jaggery. They have also a custom of Dahodo-pari, Khatru, Barma (giving lunch after death), and offering pooja. =Speciality= The marriages among Gamit are mostly in the same Gotra. The objective is to find a spouse from a known family. Astala, Mavli, and Vaghdev are their Gods and Goddesses. On occasion, they visit their places and celebrate festivals with dance and music.

Originally a duo started in 2006 by lead singer/songwriter/pianist Coley O'Toole, the band has expanded into a four- piece with the release of their debut album, Tidal Eyes. Biography Growing up in Shelton, Connecticut, frontman Coley O'Toole cited the rock music of Neil Young, Elton John, Supertramp, and the Doors along with the energy of the mid- to late-1990s Connecticut music scene as having a great influence on him. The inspiration for the band's name came from O'Toole's realization that all things must come to an end. Starting the band in the midst of a broken heart, O'Toole used a Queen and a King to depict two very powerful forms of an alliance. The alliance would eventually end and the Queen and King would ultimately destroy each other. In 2006, after a decade of playing in various projects based in Connecticut, O'Toole formed the Queen Killing Kings with drummer Jon Scerbo. The duo was met with praise in the local venues and media. With performances in Los Angeles and New York City, the band's initial success was extended beyond the local area, gaining them industry attention. After entering the Manhattan's Pyramid Studios to record what would become their debut album, former Hot Rod Circuit member and O'Toole's childhood friend Joe Ballaro joined the band on bass. Scerbo left the band early in the recording process, prompting O'Toole to bring in former Hot Rod Circuit drummer Dan Duggins. After signing to Wind-up Records, Zac Clark joined to play Fender Rhodes and organ, making the band a quartet. The band's debut album, Tidal Eyes, was released digitally by Wind-up Records on July 14, 2009.

In eukaryotes transcription is a prerequisite for translation. During transcription the pre-mRNA transcript is processes where a 5‚Ä≤ cap is attached onto mRNA and this 5‚Ä≤ cap allows for ribosome assembly onto the mRNA as it acts as a binding site for the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F. Once eIF4F is bound to the mRNA this protein complex interacts with the poly(A) binding protein which is present within the 3‚Ä≤ UTR and results in mRNA circularization. This multiprotein-mRNA complex then recruits the ribosome subunits and scans the mRNA until it reaches the start codon. Transcription of viral genomes differs from eukaryotes as viral genomes produce mRNA transcripts that lack a 5‚Äô cap site. Despite lacking a cap site viral genes contain a structural element within the 5‚Äô UTR known as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). IRES is a structural element that recruits the 40s ribosome subunit to the mRNA within close proximity of the start codon. RCNMV contains a genome that encodes for two positive sense RNA strands known as RNA1 and RNA2 and both these RNA strands lack a 5‚Äô cap and a 3‚Äô poly (A) tail. RNA1 is required in replication as it encodes for RNA replicase components. This RNA contains structural elements within the 3‚Äô and 5‚Äô UTR that bring about cap independent translation. Unlike RNA1, RNA2 encodes for a movement protein (MP) and the mRNA of RNA2 contains no structural elements within the UTRs that can bring about cap independent translation. The translation of the mRNA of RNA2 is linked with RNA2 replication. RNA1 contains several structural elements within its untranslated regions (UTRs) which allow for cap independent translation. The 3‚Ä≤ UTR contains a translation enhancer element, 3‚Ä≤TE-DR1 that brings about cap independent translation (a Cap-independent translation element) and is predicted to have 5 stem loop structures. For 3‚Ä≤TE-DR1 to have an effect on translation it was shown that both specific sequences and structures need to be present within the 5‚Ä≤UTR of RNA1. The 5‚Ä≤UTR was shown to contain four stem loop structures where all of these secondary structures contribute to affecting translation efficiently. Stem loop1 has been shown to be the most important secondary structure within the 5‚Ä≤UTR as mutating or removing this stem loop structure significantly decreases translation efficiency and this effect can be overcome by compensatory mutations. The secondary structures within the 5‚Ä≤UTR was shown to also play a role in RNA stability. Removal of the secondary structure correlated with a decrease in RNA stability. One possibly explanation for this is that the secondary structure may protect the RNA from 5‚Ä≤‚Äì3‚Ä≤ exonuclease activity. In RNA1 both structural elements within the 3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤ UTR are required to translation to occur as the 3‚Ä≤UTR contains the translation enhancer element and the 5‚Ä≤UTR contains structures that aid in recruiting translation factors but also act to increase RNA stability. The 3‚Ä≤UTR of RNA2 contains a Y-shaped Cap-independent translation element. This structure and several downstream stem-loops are required for synthesis of the negative strand RNA.

It is the United Kingdom's oldest independent cookery school, established in 1954 by the cookery writer Iris Syrett. It was the first school in the UK to offer a Cordon Bleu Diploma (though the Tante Marie Cordon Bleu diploma is its own independent qualification and the Academy is not part of the 'Le Cordon Bleu' international network). The diploma forms the backbone of Tante Marie's courses, which range in length from one day workshops in particular areas of cooking to the full-time, one-year professional Cordon Bleu Diploma which is awarded along with the Level 4 Diploma in Professional Culinary Arts, a formally accredited qualification, created by Tante Marie Culinary Academy with the Confederation of Tourism and Hospitality in 2010. The Academy also has a restaurant staffed by graduates, who are studying for a Level 5 Diploma in Culinary and Hospitality Management whilst working in 'The Restaurant at Tante Marie'. Iris Syrett died in 1964, after which Wendy Majerowicz became Principal. In 1967 the school moved to Woodham House, Carlton Road. John and Beryl Childs, who owned the school from 1982 to 1999, continued the development of courses and curriculum into a programme that has become recognised as one of the world's leading independent providers of culinary training. Marcella O'Donovan, one of the school's teachers, bought the school with the backing of her family in 1999. The O'Donovans oversaw the introduction of new courses to cater for the gap year and the amateur cook market, while at the same time maintaining the school's professional emphasis. In April 2008, the school was bought by its then Deputy Principal, Andrew Maxwel with Gordon Ramsay Holdings and Lyndy Redding, a former graduate of the Intensive Cordon Bleu Diploma course who now owns Absolute Taste, a catering and events planning business based in London. In May 2014 it was announced the school would be moving to a site in Woking town centre. The new base opened in the refurbished Alexander House, Commercial Way, in early 2015. Two floors of the building house the cookery school, with training theatre kitchen, student kitchens and lectures rooms.

It stands as the largest single religious complex ever built during Angkorian Era, as its exterior enclosure is about 5 km square,Rooney, 2005, pp.379-381 even if the isolated location makes it one of less visited Angkorian sites. History There are few historical data about Preah Khan Kompong Svay. French scholars argued it had been founded in the 11th century, probably by Suryavarman I.Higham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, It was a royal residence during the kingdom of Suryavarman II and even Jayavarman VII lived here, before recapturing the capital city of Yasodharapura from invading Chams in 1181, and improved the complex. The rediscovery of the complex After some French missions at the turn of the 19th century, Victor Goloubew in 1937 engaged in aerial surveys which revealed the true extent of the complex.Mauger, 1939, p.198 Many famous Khmer sculptures come from here, such as the putative head of Jayavarman VII which is displayed at the National Museum of Phnom Penh. The sculptures and carvings of Preah Khan of Kompong Svay are among the peak works of Khmer art and the temples have been widely sacked in the past during official expeditions, such as during Louis Delaporte's, whereas thieves have largely damaged many structures while looting sculptures and carvings from the second half of the 1990s.Ray, Robinson, 2008, pp.262-263 The site Preah Khan Kompong Svay covers an area about 5 kilometers square, is oriented to north-east and has four concentric enclosures. It was provided with water by a large baray (2.8 km by 750 m but almost completely dried at present), which crosses the eastern side. On an artificial island (mebon) in the middle of the baray there is Preah Thkol (), a cruciform temple in sandstone with a standing central tower. In the southeastern corner stands the remains of the 15 metres high pyramid of Preah Damrei, with laterite enclosure and two stone elephants (Damrei means elephant) at its upper corners. The other two elephants are exhibited at the National Museum of Phnom Penh and Guimet Museum in Paris. Inside the exterior enclosure, in the middle of the western side of baray, there is Prasat Preah Stung (), with a peculiar four-faced central tower in Bayon style, which is preceded by a landing-stage with nƒÅga balustrades. A laterite causeway leads from here to a centric enclosure, 701 m by 1097 m, surrounded by a moat and endowed with four gopuras similar to Angkor Thom. Near the eastern gopura there is a dharmasala. The inner laterite enclosure contains the central sanctuary, that stands on a two-tier platform. The central tower collapsed because of a looting attempt in 2003.PeaceOfAngkor It has entrances in all cardinal directions and is rounded by a windowed gallery.

Climate change effects will create a climate gap by hurting more vulnerable communities through health related complications, job loss, an increase in the cost of basic necessities and an increase in natural disasters that will be difficult if not impossible for low income families to recover from. Modern researchers argue that in order to truly correct for the impacts of climate change, policy makers will need to take regional and local issues into account when drafting policy.Lal, Pankaj; Alavalapati, Janaki R. R.; and Mercer, Evan D., \\"Socio-economic Impacts of Climate Change on Rural United States\\" (2011). USDA Forest Service / UNL Faculty Publications. 254. https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdafsfacpub/254 It will be necessary to gain information on how climate change will interact with other modern issues, especially regarding economic issues and financial inequity.Rosenzweig C, Willbanks T (2010) The state of climate change vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation research: strengthening knowledge base and community. Clim Change 100:103‚Äì106 Overview Disparate health impacts of climate change Extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts and floods, are expected to increase in their frequency and intensity in the next hundred years due to climate change.http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment- report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities, especially those living in urban areas, are affected by heat-related illness at greater rates due to factors such as lack of access to air conditioning during heat waves and heavy air pollution days, lack of transportation to get to a hospital or government funded cooling facilities, and occupations that require outdoor work such as construction and agricultural jobs. One of the most detrimental effects, though, is the heat- island effect in urban neighborhoods. Heat-islands occur when a community has a lot of concrete/asphalt and very little trees to absorb the heat. Without trees and parks, there is little to no dissipation of the heat retained in the concrete. Research has shown that there is a positive correlation between racial and ethnic minorities living in a neighborhood and the proportion of concrete in that area.Morello-Frosch, R., and B.

Higher temperatures resulting from climate change will also increase chemical interactions between nitrogen oxide, volatile organic gases and sunlight, leading to increased concentrations of ambient ozone in urban areas.http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/2007GL031101.pdf Along with particulate matter, ozone is a primary cause of air pollution-related health effects. Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities in the United States are more likely to live in areas with dangerous levels of air pollution. This pollution will be exacerbated by climate change, and low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to lack health insurance,http://www.rprogress.org/publications/2006/CARB_Full_0306.pdf making them increasingly vulnerable to these elevated levels of air pollutants.Shonkoff SB, Morello-Frosch R, Pastor M, Sadd J. 2009.

Available at: http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/publications/cat/index.html One of the largest issues when it comes to the intersection of climate change issues and health issues will be access to care. There are many barriers faced by minorities and low-income families when it comes to access to health care, including medical costs, transportation, availability of hospitals, inability to pay for health insurance, and lack of education/information on what to do in certain situations. Populations in rural areas are specifically disadvantaged when it comes to access, as they have significantly less healthcare providers in their area.Rural and Urban Health. (2014, April 30). Health Policy Institute. https://hpi.georgetown.edu/rural/ This is due to the disincentive of healthcare professionals to work in locations that offer lower salaries, less educational and recreational opportunities and significant social isolation from their peers. Disparate economic impacts of climate change The proportion of income that low socioeconomic status groups spend on basic necessities such as food, water and energy is already greater than the proportion spent by other populations and is expected to increase as the cost of these necessities increases due to climate change.BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics). 2002. Consumer expenditure survey. Washington D.C. This effectively places a higher economic burden of rising costs on those least able to pay for it. Additionally, job sectors that employ predominantly low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities such as the agriculture and tourism industries are projected to experience the most dramatic shifts due to climate change, reducing employment opportunities for these populations.EDD (California Employment Development Department). 2004. Occupational Employment (2002) and Wage (2003) Data, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey Results. Sacramento, California. The rise in temperature and change in precipitation will directly impact tourism and recreation. As rises in temperature begins to shift natural habitats, wildlife tourism and hunting tourism will begin to shift.Karl TR, Melillo JM, Peterson TC (eds) (2009) Global climate change impacts in the United States. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge When end of season snowpack decreases at higher rates, ski seasons will be significantly shortened, directly impacting the rural communities where ski resorts are located.Zimmerman G, O‚ÄôBady C, Hurlbutt B (2006) Climate change: modeling a warmer Rockies and assessing the implications. The 2006 state of the Rockies report card. Colorado College, Colorado Springs, pp 89‚Äì102 Perhaps the largest change in wildlife tourism will occur with a shift in the health of our forests. The expected impact of climate change is expected to disincentivize investment in forestry management.Lal, Pankaj; Alavalapati, Janaki R. R.; and Mercer, Evan D., \\"Socio-economic Impacts of Climate Change on Rural United States\\" (2011). USDA Forest Service / UNL Faculty Publications. 254. https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdafsfacpub/254 If this happens, there will be a substantial rise in wildfires, losses in forest recreation and increased costs of wildfire abatement and clean up.Ruth M, Coelho D, Karetnikov D (2007) The U.S. economic impacts of climate change and the costs of inaction. Center for Integrative Environmental Research, University of Maryland, College Park Counties living near forests also tend to be rural, and often rely on the funds generated from wildlife tourism to stimulate the economy, making them extremely vulnerable to the effects of wildfires. Finally, if animals and habitats are not able to evolve as quickly as the rise in temperature, it will result in the extinction of local habitats and animals.Feng S, Hu Q (2007) Changes in winter snowfall/precipitation ratio in the contiguous United States. J Geophys Res 112:1‚Äì12. While the impact of climate change on tourism will differ greatly dependent on the region, agricultural jobs will be lost across the board. This is because increases in precipitation in some areas and long seasons of drought in others (along with higher temperatures and CO2 concentrations overall) will result in a lower yield, leading to less profit and resulting in layoffs.Juhwan Lee, Steven De Gryze, and Johan Six ‚ÄúEffect of Climate Change on Field Crop Production in the Central Valley of California.‚Äù Report from California Climate Change Center, March 2009 Moreover, higher temperatures and CO2 levels will benefit weeds over crops, allowing for invasive weed species to expand.Hatfield J, Boote K, Fay P et al (2008) Agriculture.

Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change 13(5‚Äì6):555‚Äì575 When it comes to ranching and farming, there will be higher production costs as a result of lower yields for crops that feed the animals and higher costs in keeping them healthy in higher temperatures. Without proper adaptation or relocation measures, experts argue that the job loss resulting from changes in the agricultural sector will be extremely detrimental. Also, due to the lack of access to insurance and emergency credit, less savings, fewer personal resources and disproportionate hardships from previous economic stress, low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are likely to suffer the most pronounced and long-lasting economic impacts from climate change-related extreme weather events such as hurricanes.http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/6/9/9/pages106994/p106994-1.php Unfortunately, the destruction of property will only become more prevalent as extreme weather events increase in severity and frequency. This will directly result in a rise in the cost of disaster insurance, making it prohibitively expensive for low-income families.Fothergill, A., and L.

Moreover, without insurance, it will become difficult if not impossible to recover, forcing many low income families into homelessness. Finally, in order to cover the rising costs of disasters, the government will likely pull funding from education, public transportation and health and social programs.Shonkoff SB, Morello-Frosch R, Pastor M, Sadd J. 2009. \\"Minding the Climate Gap: Implications of Environmental Health Inequities for Mitigation Policies\\" in California Environmental Justice 2(4): 173-177. Rural America and the climate gap Rural America is more vulnerable than urban communities due to lower income on average, limited professional opportunities, dependency on the government for transfer payments, lack of a robust education system and higher poverty incidence.USDA ERS (2010) An enhanced quality of life for rural Americans: rural gallery. Poverty rates by region and metro status, 2006. http://www.ers.usda.gov/emphases/rural/gallery/IncomePoverty.htm It is important to note that just as effects will be different among urban/rural communities and low/high income families, effects will differ by region as well. Consequently, experts recommend that policy makers focus on regions and communities instead of abatement as a whole country in order to truly prepare for the impact of climate change.Lal, Pankaj; Alavalapati, Janaki R. R.; and Mercer, Evan D., \\"Socio-economic Impacts of Climate Change on Rural United States\\" (2011). USDA Forest Service / UNL Faculty Publications. 254. https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdafsfacpub/254 As mentioned previously, the rural Americans have significantly less access to healthcare than urban Americans. On top of the issue of low numbers of healthcare providers, rural communities also have to pay higher transportation costs and deal with an emergency system that is not as effective thanks to geographic distance.Karl TR, Melillo JM, Peterson TC (eds) (2009) Global climate change impacts in the United States. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge Due to these issues, rural Americans are more likely to experience more severe health issues resulting from climate change. As climate vulnerability is highly influenced by income level, places like rural America that have low shared of high skilled jobs and low returns on college degrees in the labor market are more susceptible to the effects of climate change. As opposed to their urban counterparts, whose share of transfer payments amounts to 1/8th of income, 1/5th of rural income is dependent on transfer payments.USDA ERS (2010) Rural income, poverty and welfare: rural welfare. http://www.ers.usda.gov/ Briefing/incomepovertywelfare/RuralWelfare/ This is important, because if the government can't keep up with the costs of damage resulting from climate change related disasters, rural locations will be more vulnerable than urban areas as a higher share of their income comes from outside the region. Experts agree that rural America will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis, as rise in temperature, precipitation, CO2 levels and natural disasters will have ranging effects depending on location and sector.

The idea of a performance space in the area was conceived in the late 1940s by John Stewart, a leading promoter of amateur dramatics in Glasgow. The theatre officially opened on 19 May 1951. History After the decline and subsequent closure of his Park Theatre Club in the West End of Glasgow, John Stewart decided to plan a theatre site in the Knockendarroch area of Pitlochry. However Stewart's plans were met with little success as building licences were refused by the Ministry of Works. Following this setback, Stewart had the idea of founding a tent-style theatre. This would involve him viewing the wet weather tent of London's Regent's Park and the Birmingham Arena Theatre. Stewart searched for the construction company of these tents in Walsall, eventually investing in one for a theatre space for Pitlochry. After construction work and promotion by the Scottish Tourist Board, the theatre officially opened on May 19th, 1951. In his opening address, chairman of the board and later Secretary of State for Scotland Tom Johnston said, \\"This theatre is a monument to one man‚Äôs courage, one man‚Äôs persistence, and one man‚Äôs great faith.\\" After years 30 years of use and regular cases of damage to the tents by weather, it was decided in the late 1970s that the tent structure would be renovated and stabilised. Construction work began on a new theatre building at the current site, and eventually on May 19th, 1981, the new theatre building was opened on the 30th anniversary of John Stewart's first tent. Modern day The theatre is now of great cultural importance to the Perthshire area. Annually every summer, the theatre and its surrounding area attract thousands of tourists with the theatre's famous summer season, which showcases a large amount of the country's talent in dramatic arts, comedy and writing. Each summer the theatre offers six plays in daily repertory, enabling visitors to see six plays in six nights (or in four days if two matinees are included); the theatre asserts that \\"No other UK theatre attempts this extraordinary feat\\" and that the nearest similar offering is in Canada. For example, the 2018 season offered: Chicago the musical; Jim Cartwright's The Rise and Fall of Little Voice; J. M. Barrie's Quality Street; Tom Stoppard's Travesties; Rodney Ackland's Before the Party; and Rona Munro's The Last Witch. Expansion In 2014, it was announced that the Pitlochry Festival Theatre would undergo a ¬£25 million expansion of the current building. Plans have been made to have the expansion completed and opened for the theatre's 70th anniversary in 2021.

General Information  HCUP provides access to healthcare databases for research and policy analysis, as well as tools and products to enhance the capabilities of the data. HCUP databases combine the data collection efforts of State data organizations, hospital associations, private data organizations, and the Federal Government to create a national information resource of patient-level healthcare data. State organizations that provide data to HCUP are called Partners. HCUP includes multiyear hospital administrative (inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department) data in the United States, with all-payer, encounter-level information beginning in 1988. These databases enable research on health and policy issues at the national, State, and local levels, including cost and quality of health services, medical practice patterns, access to healthcare, and outcomes of treatments. AHRQ has also developed a set of software tools to be used when evaluating hospital data. These software tools can be used with the HCUP databases and with other administrative databases. HCUP‚Äôs Supplemental Files are only for use with HCUP databases. HCUP databases have been used in various studies on a number of topics, such as breast cancer, depression, and multimorbidity, incidence and cost of injuries, role of socioeconomic status in patients leaving against medical advice, multiple chronic conditions and disparities in readmissions, and hospitalization costs for cystic fibrosis.  HCUP User Support Website (HCUP-US)  The HCUP User Support website is the main repository of information for HCUP. It is designed to answer HCUP-related questions; provide detailed information on HCUP databases, tools, and products; and offer technical assistance to HCUP users. HCUP‚Äôs tools, publications, documentation, news, services, HCUP Fast Stats, and HCUPnet (the online data query system) may all be accessed through HCUP-US. HCUP-US is located at https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov.  HCUP Overview Course  HCUP has developed an interactive online course that provides an overview of the features, capabilities, and potential uses of HCUP. The course is modular, so users can either move through the entire course or access the resources in which they are most interested. The On-line HCUP Overview Course (https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/overviewcourse.jsp) can work both as an introduction to HCUP data and tools and a refresher for established users.  HCUP Online Tutorial Series  The HCUP Online Tutorial Series (https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tech_assist/tutorials.jsp) is a set of interactive training courses that provide HCUP data users with information about HCUP data and tools, and training on technical methods for conducting research with HCUP data. The online courses are modular, so users can move through an entire course or access the sections in which they are most interested. Topics include loading and checking HCUP data, understanding HCUP‚Äôs sampling design, calculating standard errors, producing national estimates, conducting multiyear analysis, and using the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD).  HCUP Databases  HCUP databases bring together data from State data organizations, hospital associations, private data organizations, and the Federal Government to create an information resource of patient-level healthcare data. HCUP‚Äôs databases (https://www.hcup- us.ahrq.gov/databases.jsp) date back to 1988 data files. The databases contain encounter-level information for all payers compiled in a uniform format with privacy protections in place. Researchers and policymakers can use the records to identify, track, and analyze national trends in healthcare use, access, charges, quality, and outcomes. HCUP databases are released approximately 6 to 18 months after the end of a given calendar year, with State databases available earlier than the national or nationwide datasets. Currently, there are eight types of HCUP databases: four with national- and regional-level data and three with State- and local-level data. = National Databases = *National Inpatient Sample (NIS) (formerly the Nationwide Inpatient Sample): A 20 percent stratified sample of all-payer, inpatient discharges from U.S. community hospitals (excluding rehabilitation and long-term acute-care hospitals). The NIS is available from 1988 forward, and a new database is released annually, approximately 18 months after the end of a calendar year. *Kids‚Äô Inpatient Database (KID): A nationwide sample of all-payer pediatric inpatient care discharges. Its large sample size is ideal for developing national and regional estimates and enables analyses of rare conditions, such as congenital anomalies, as well as uncommon treatments, such as organ transplantation. The KID was released every 3 years, from 1997 to 2012 and resumed release again in 2016. *Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS): An all-payer emergency department (ED) database of approximately 30 million records that yields national estimates of 145 million ED visits. The NEDS captures encounters where the patient is admitted for inpatient treatment, as well as those in which the patient is treated and released. The NEDS is released annually and is available from 2006 forward. *Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD): The NRD is designed to support various types of analyses of national readmission rates for all patients, regardless of expected payer for the hospital stay. The NRD is released annually and is available from 2010 forward. *Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (NASS): The NASS is the largest all-payer ambulatory surgery database that has been constructed in the United States, yielding national estimates of major ambulatory surgery encounters performed in hospital-owned facilities. The NASS is released annually and is available starting with the 2016 data year. = State Databases = *State Inpatient Databases (SID): The SID are databases from the universe of inpatient discharge abstracts from participating States, released annually. Data are available from 1995 forward. The SID are released on a rolling basis, as early as 6 months following the end of a calendar year. *State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases (SASD): The SASD are ambulatory surgery and other outpatient service abstracts from hospital-owned and sometimes freestanding ambulatory surgery sites in participating States. Data are available from 1997 forward. The SASD are released on a rolling basis, as early as 6 months following the end of a calendar year. *State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD): The SEDD are hospital-affiliated emergency department data for visits in participating States that do not result in hospitalizations. Data are available from 1999 forward. The SEDD are released on a rolling basis, as early as 6 months following the end of a calendar year.  HCUP Tools and Software  HCUP provides a number of tools and software programs that can be applied to HCUP and other similar administrative databases. = Readily Available HCUP Statistics = HCUPnet  HCUPnet (https://hcupnet.ahrq.gov/) is an online query system that provides healthcare statistics and information from the HCUP national (NIS, NEDS, KID, and NRD) and State (SID, SASD, and SEDD) databases for those States that have agreed to participate. HCUPnet can be used for identifying, tracking, analyzing, and comparing statistics on hospital inpatient stays, emergency care, and ambulatory surgery, as well as obtaining measures of quality-based information from the AHRQ Quality Indicators. Select statistics are available at a national- and county-level. HCUPnet can also be used for trend analysis with healthcare data available from 1993 forward. HCUPnet also includes a feature called hospital readmissions that provides users with some statistics on hospital readmissions within 7 and 30 days of hospital discharge.  HCUP Fast Stats  HCUP Fast Stats (https://www.hcup- us.ahrq.gov/faststats/landing.jsp) is a web-based tool that provides easy access to the latest HCUP-based statistics for healthcare information topics. HCUP Fast Stats uses visual statistical displays in standalone graphs, trend figures, or simple tables to convey complex information at a glance. Fast Stats topics are updated regularly (quarterly or annually, as newer data become available) for timely, topic-specific national and State-level statistics. The following topics are available: *State Trends in Hospital Use by Payer (formerly called Effect of Health Insurance Expansion on Hospital Use and Effect of Medicaid Expansion on Hospital Use). This topic includes statistics from up to 44 States on the number of hospital discharges by payer group. *National Hospital Utilization and Costs. This topic focuses on national statistics on inpatient stays: Trends, Most Common Diagnoses, and Most Common Operations. *State Trends in Emergency Department Visits by Payer. These ED statistics are a supplement to the existing State-level inpatient stay trends by expected payer. *Opioid-Related Hospital Use, National and State. This topic reports population-based rates of opioid-related hospital use by discharge quarter. Trends are available for inpatient stays and emergency department visits by expected payer. *Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), National and State. This new topic provides trends in NAS-related newborn hospitalizations at the national and State level. Rates of NAS per 1,000 newborn hospitalizations are presented overall as well as by sex, expected payer, community-level income, and patient location. *Hurricane Impact on Hospital Use. This new topic provides historical inpatient and treat-and-release emergency department utilization information from 11 U.S. hurricanes between 2005 and 2017. Supported by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) and created in collaboration with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), this topic is designed to help HCUP users understand medical care utilization during and after past hurricanes to assist in the preparation for and deployment of medical services in future disasters. = HCUP Software = The HCUP software can be applied to HCUP databases, to systematically create new data elements from existing data, thereby enhancing a researcher's ability to conduct analyses. While designed to be used with HCUP databases, the analytic tools may be applied to other administrative databases.  Clinical Classifications Software (CCS)  The Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) provides a method for classifying diagnoses or procedures into clinically meaningful categories. These can be used for aggregate statistical reporting of a variety of topics, such as identifying populations for disease- or procedure-specific studies or developing statistical reports providing information (i.e., charges and length of stay) about relatively specific conditions. Four versions of the CCS Software are available: * The Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) for ICD-10-CM aggregates more than 70,000 ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes into a manageable number of clinically meaningful categories. The categories are organized across 21 body systems, which generally follow the structure of the ICD-10-CM diagnosis chapters. *The Clinical Classification Software (CCS) for ICD-10-PCS procedures (beta version) categorizes more than 77,000 ICD-10-PCS procedure codes into clinically meaningful categories and can be used to identify populations for procedure-specific studies or to develop statistical reports about relatively specific procedures. *Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) for ICD-9-CM is based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), a uniform and standardized coding system. The CCS for ICD-9-CM provides a diagnosis and procedure categorization scheme that can be used to classify more than 14,000 ICD-9-CM diagnosis and 3,900 procedure codes into a manageable number of clinically meaningful categories. The CCS for ICD-9-CM was updated annually starting January 1980 through September 30, 2015. ICD-9-CM codes were frozen in preparation for ICD-10-CM implementation and regular maintenance of the codes has been suspended. *Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) for Services and Procedures provides users with a method of classifying Current Procedural Terminology (CPT¬Æ) codes and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes into 244 clinically meaningful procedure categories. More than 9,000 CPT/HCPCS codes and 6,000 HCPCs codes are accounted for. The CCS versions and their user guides are available for download from the HCUP-US website: https://www.hcup- us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp.  Chronic Condition Indicator  The Chronic Condition Indicator (CCI) facilitates health services research on diagnoses using administrative data. The CCI tools categorize ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnoses codes into two classifications: chronic or not chronic. A chronic condition is defined as a condition that lasts 12 months or longer and meets one or both of the following tests: (a) it places limitations on self-care, independent living, and social interactions; and (b) it results in the need for ongoing intervention with medical products, services, and special equipment. Two versions of the CCI software are available, CCI for ICD-9-CM and CCI for ICD-10-CM (beta version). The ICD-9-CM CCI was updated annually and is valid for codes from January 1, 1980, through September 20, 2015. The ICD-10-CM CCI is updated annually and is valid for codes from October 1, 2015, forward. The CCI Software is available for download on the HCUP-US website: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp.  Elixhauser Comorbidity Software  Elixhauser Comorbidity Software assigns variables that identify comorbidities in hospital discharge records using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM diagnosis coding. Two versions of the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software are available: Elixhauser Comorbidity Software for ICD-10-CM (beta version) and Elixhauser Comorbidity Software for ICD-9-CM. The Elixhauser Software for ICD-9-CM was updated annually from January 1, 1980, through September 30, 2015. The Elixhauser Comorbidity Software for ICD-10-CM (beta version) is updated annually and based on the ICD-10-CM and MS-DRG codes that are valid through September 30 of the designated fiscal year after October 1, 2015. The Elixhauser Comorbidity Software is available for download on the HCUP-US website: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp.  Procedure Classes  Procedure Classes facilitate research on hospital services using administrative data by identifying whether an ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM procedure is (a) diagnostic or therapeutic, and (b) minor or major in terms of invasiveness and/or resource use. There are two versions of Procedure Classes tools, Procedure Classes for ICD-9-CM and Procedure Classes for ICD-10-PCS (beta version). The Procedure Classes can be used to categorize procedure codes into one of four broad categories: minor diagnostic, minor therapeutic, major diagnostic, and major therapeutic. The Procedure Classes for ICD-9-CM were updated annually from January 1, 1980, through September 30, 2015. The Procedure Classes for ICD-10-PCS (beta version) are updated annually and valid for codes from October 1, 2015, forward. Procedure Classes are available for download from the HCUP-US website: https://www.hcup- us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp.  Utilization Flags  Utilization Flags combine information from Uniform Billing (UB-04) revenue codes and ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-PCS procedure codes to create flags‚Äîor indicators‚Äîof utilization of services rendered in healthcare settings such as hospitals, emergency departments, and ambulatory surgery centers. The Utilization Flags can be used to study a broad range of services, including simple diagnostic tests and resource-intense procedures, such as use of intensive care units. They can also be used to more reliably examine utilization of diagnostic and therapeutic services. There are two types of Utilization Flags, Utilization Flags for ICD-9-CM and Utilization Flags for ICD-10-CM/PCS (beta version). The Utilization Flags for ICD-9-CM were updated annually from January 1, 2003, through September 30, 2015. The Utilization Flags for ICD-10-CM/PCS (beta version) are updated annually and valid for codes from October 1, 2015, forward. The Utilization Flags are available for download from the HCUP-US website: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp.  Surgery Flags  Surgery Flag Software classifies procedures and encounters in ICD-9-CM or CPT-based inpatient and ambulatory surgery into two types of surgical categories: NARROW and BROAD. NARROW surgery is based on a narrow, targeted, and restrictive definition and includes invasive surgical procedures. An invasive therapeutic surgical procedure involves incision, excision, manipulation, or suturing of tissue that penetrates or breaks the skin; typically requires use of an operating room; and requires regional anesthesia, general anesthesia, or sedation to control pain. BROAD surgery includes procedures that fall under the NARROW category but adds less invasive therapeutic surgeries and diagnostic procedures often performed in surgical settings. Users must agree to a license agreement with the American Medical Association to use the Surgery Flags before accessing the software. The Surgery Flags are available for download from the HCUP-US website: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp.  AHRQ Quality Indicators (QIs)  The AHRQ Quality Indicators (QIs) (https://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/) are standardized, evidence-based measures of healthcare quality that can be used with readily available hospital inpatient administrative data to measure and track clinical performance and outcomes. The AHRQ QIs consist of four modules measuring various aspects of quality: * Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) identify issues of access to outpatient care, including appropriate followup care after hospital discharge. More specifically, the PQIs use data from hospital discharges to identify admissions that might have been avoided through access to high-quality outpatient care. The PQIs are population based and adjusted for covariates. * Inpatient Quality Indicators (IQIs) provide a perspective on quality of care inside hospitals, including: ** Inpatient mortality for surgical procedures and medical conditions; ** Utilization of procedures for which there are questions of overuse, underuse, and misuse; and ** Volume of procedures for which hospital procedure volume is an important indicator of performance. * Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) provide information on potentially avoidable safety events that represent opportunities for improvement in the delivery of care. More specifically, they focus on potential in-hospital complications and adverse events following surgeries, procedures, and childbirth. * Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs) focus on potentially preventable complications and iatrogenic events for pediatric patients treated in hospitals and on preventable hospitalizations among pediatric patients, taking into account the special characteristics of the pediatric population. = HCUP Supplemental Files = The HCUP Supplemental Files augment applicable HCUP databases with additional data elements or analytically useful information that is not available when the HCUP databases are originally released. They cannot be used with other administrative databases. The HCUP Supplemental Files are available for download from the HCUP-US website: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp.  Cost- to-Charge Ratio Files (CCR)  The Cost-to-Charge Ratio (CCR) Files (https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/state/costtocharge.jsp) are hospital-level files designed to convert the hospital total charge data to total cost estimates for services when merged with data elements exclusively in the HCUP NIS, KID, NRD, and SID. HCUP databases are limited to information on total hospital charges, which reflect the amount billed to the payer per patient encounter. Total charges do not reflect the actual cost of providing care or the payment received by the hospital for services provided. This total charge data can be converted into cost estimates using the CCR Files, which include hospital-wide values of the all-payer inpatient cost-to-charge ratio for nearly every hospital in the participating NIS, KID, NRD, and SID. The CCR Files are updated annually and available for the HCUP inpatient databases beginning with 2001 data. CCR Files for use with the HCUP emergency department databases (NEDS and SEDD) are under development.  Hospital Market Structure (HMS) Files  The Hospital Market Structure (HMS) Files (https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/hms/hms.jsp) are hospital-level files designed to supplement the data elements in the NIS, KID, and SID databases. The HMS Files contain various measures of hospital market competition. Hospital market definitions were based on hospital locations, and in some cases, patient ZIP Codes. Hospital locations were obtained from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey Database, Area Resource File (ARF), HCUP Historical Urban/Rural ‚Äì County (HURC) file, and ArcView GIS. Patient ZIP Codes were obtained from the SID. HMS Files are useful for performing empirical analyses that examine the effects of hospital competition on the cost, access, and quality of hospital services. The HCUP HMS Files are available for the 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009 data years.  HCUP Supplemental Variables for Revisit Analyses  The HCUP Supplemental Variables for Revisit Analyses (https://www.hcup- us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/revisit/revisit.jsp) allow users to track sequential visits for a patient within a State and across facilities and hospital settings (inpatient, emergency department, and ambulatory surgery) while adhering to strict privacy guidelines. Users can use the available clinical information to determine if sequential visits are unrelated, an expected followup, complications from a previous treatment, or an unexpected revisit or rehospitalization. The supplemental files must be merged with the corresponding SID, SASD, or SEDD for any analysis. Beginning with 2009 data, the revisit variables are included in the Core file of the HCUP State Databases when possible.  NIS and KID Trend Files  The NIS-Trends (https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/nation/nis/nistrends.jsp) and KID-Trends (https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/nation/kid/kidtrends.jsp) files are available to help researchers conduct longitudinal analyses. They are discharge-level files that provide researchers with the trend weights and, in the case of the NIS-Trends, data elements that are consistently defined across data years.  American Hospital Association (AHA) Linkage Files  The American Hospital Association (AHA) Linkage Files (https://www.hcup- us.ahrq.gov/db/state/ahalinkage/aha_linkage.jsp) are hospital-level files that contain a small number of data elements that allow researchers to supplement the HCUP State Databases with information from the AHA Annual Survey Databases (https://www.ahadata.com/aha-annual-survey-database-asdb/). The files are designed to support richer empirical analysis where hospital characteristics may be important factors. Linkage is only possible in States that allow the release of hospital identifiers and are unique by State and year.  HCUP News and Reports  HCUP produces material to report new findings based on HCUP data and to announce HCUP news. * The HCUP eNews summarizes activities of the HCUP project quarterly. * The HCUP Mailing List sends email updates on news, product releases, events, and the quarterly eNews to interested subscribers. * HCUP Statistical Briefs provide healthcare statistics for various topics based on HCUP databases. * HCUP Infographics present visual representations of data from the HCUP Statistical Brief series. Topics have included inpatient vs. outpatient surgeries in U.S. hospitals, neonatal hospital stays related to substance use, and characteristics of hospital stays involving malnutrition. * HCUP Methods Series Reports offer methodological information on the HCUP databases and software tools. * HCUP Findings-At-A-Glance provide snapshots covering a broad range of health policy issues related to hospital use and costs.

Ringo (October 12, 1860 ‚Äì April 12, 1889) was a professional baseball player whose career lasted from 1880 to 1888. He played four seasons of Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Philadelphia Quakers (1883‚Äì84), Philadelphia Athletics (1884), Detroit Wolverines (1885), Pittsburgh Alleghenys (1885‚Äì86), and Kansas City Cowboys (1886). He committed suicide by morphine overdose in April 1889 at age 28. His suicide is the earliest by a major league baseball player to be recorded in the Baseball Almanac. Early years Ringo was born in Parkville, Missouri, in 1860. Ringo began his professional baseball career in 1880 playing for Kansas City. He also played minor league baseball in Peoria, Illinois. Major League Baseball=Philadelphia= When the Peoria baseball club folded, Ringo signed with the Philadelphia Quakers. He made his major league debut on May 1, 1883, at age 22. During the 1883 season, he appeared in 60 games for the Quakers, 39 as a catcher, 11 as an outfielder, six as a shortstop, five as a third baseman and two as a second baseman. He compiled a .190 batting average with 10 doubles, a triple and 12 RBIs in 221 at bats. Despite his poor offensive showing, Ringo displayed impressive defensive capabilities behind the plate. In only 39 games as a catcher, Ringo managed to rank fourth among the National League's catchers with six double plays turned and fifth among the league's catchers with a 6.10 range factor. Ringo began the 1884 season with the Quakers and compiled a .132 batting average with two doubles and six RBIs in 91 at bats. He appeared in 26 games with the 1884 Quakers, all as a catcher. In August 1884, Ringo was released by the Quakers and signed as a free agent by the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association. He appeared in only two games for the Quakers and had no hits in six at bats. =Detroit= In 1885, Ringo signed with the Detroit Wolverines as a backup to catcher Charlie Bennett. Ringo appeared in 17 games for the Wolverines, including eight games each at catcher and third base. He compiled a career high .246 batting average in 65 at bats for Detroit. However, he was released by the Wolverines and fined $100 for what the Sporting News described as \\"lushing.\\" =Pittsburgh= After his release from Detroit, Ringo reportedly \\"dropped out of public notice altogether.\\" In early September 1885, the Sporting Life reported that he had \\"finally pulled himself together\\" and had recently been catching and playing creditable first and second base for Augusta. He next played with the Pittsburgh Alleghenies of the American Association at the end of the 1885 season. He appeared in a total of 18 games, nine each at catcher and first base, for Pittsburgh during the 1885 and 1886 seasons. He compiled a .182 batting average for Pittsburgh in 1885 and increased his average to .214 in 1886. =Kansas City= Ringo concluded his major league career appearing in 16 games, 13 at catcher, for the Kansas City Cowboys in 1886. He compiled a .232 batting average with seven doubles and seven RBIs in 56 at bats for the Cowboys. Later years During the 1887 season, Ringo remained with the Kansas City baseball club, though it had joined the Western League and was no longer a major league club. Ringo compiled a career high .382 batting average in 1887. He appeared 67 games, showing versatility with appearances at catcher (35 games), outfield (12 games), second base (11 games), shortstop (nine games), first base (three games) and third base (two games). Ringo played his last professional baseball games in 1888 as a member of the St. Paul Apostles of the Western Association. He appeared in 32 games and compiled a .262 batting average. According to a report in a St. Paul newspaper, Ringo was perceived there as \\"an excellent catcher and hard hitter, and on and off the ball field was a bright and companionable gentleman.\\" During his off-seasons, Ringo worked as a traveling salesman for a firm in Kansas City. Final weeks On January 1, 1889, Ringo was married to Emma Williams of Fort Scott, Kansas. After a lengthy period of battling problems with alcohol, Ringo had reportedly stopped drinking in the late summer or fall of 1888. In late January, the Sporting Life reported that Ringo was in Kansas City \\"without an engagement for next season.\\" The newspaper further noted that Ringo had played well in 1888 and opined: \\"He is a good man when he keeps straight, and he has kept straight for a long time now. Here's a chance for some team to secure a good, hard-working catcher.\\" He signed to catch for the Kansas City baseball club and reported to training camp in the middle of March. For several months prior to reporting to training camp, it was reported that Ringo \\"had not touched whisky, of which he is inordinately fond.\\" Shortly after training camp began in March 1889, Ringo resumed drinking and had been on a \\"terrible spree\\" for two weeks before his death. (available on-line through the Library of Congress's \\"Chronicling America\\" database) On the afternoon of April 11, 1889, Ringo ingested 40 grains of morphine at his mother's residence at 1214 Virginia Avenue in Kansas City. It was reported that the morphine was his second attempt at suicide, and his actions were motivated by feelings of mortification and shame at being unable to free himself from alcohol. According to one newspaper account, the suicide was \\"deliberately planned and carefully executed\\", and the drug had hours to take its effect before Ringo's condition was discovered. (available on-line through the Library of Congress's \\"Chronicling America\\" database)(available on-line through the Library of Congress's \\"Chronicling America\\" database) A doctor was called and at 10:30 p.m., Ringo was declared to be in dangerous condition. (available on-line through the Library of Congress's \\"Chronicling America\\" database) He died at 9 a.m. the next day in the presence of his family. Ringo's suicide is the earliest by a major league baseball player to be recorded in the Baseball Almanac. He was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Kansas City.[https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/76c6bacd Society for American Baseball Research References Major League Baseball catchers Philadelphia Quakers players Philadelphia Athletics (AA) players Detroit Wolverines players Pittsburgh Alleghenys players Kansas City Cowboys (NL) players Augusta Browns players Kansas City Cowboys (minor league) players St. Paul Apostles players Baseball players from Missouri 1860 births 1889 deaths Baseball players who committed suicide Drug-related suicides in Missouri 19th-century baseball players People from Parkville, Missouri ","title":"Frank Ringo"},{"id":"23762990","text":"Arnaud Margueritte (born 7 March 1973) is a retired professional footballer.

Near the mouth of the glen, at Auchronie, the Water of Mark is joined by the Water of Lee from Loch Lee to become the River North Esk. This flows through Glen Esk, one of the Five Glens of Angus. The land is managed by the Dalhousie estate. Mount Keen Glen Mark provides the southern walking route to Mount Keen. Starting at the car park in Auchronie, walkers follow the glen to the Glenmark Cottage where the path rises along the northern slopes of the glen, past the peak of Couternach and climbs further to Mount Keen. Queen's Well Queen's Well Queen Victoria and her consort Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle and delighted in travelling the mountain routes around. In 1861 they rode the from Balmoral to Glen Mark and met with Lord Dalhousie beside an artesian well. Here they were refreshed by the spring water before continuing to Invermark Lodge where they stayed overnight. To commemorate the visit, Lord Dalhousie erected a monument in the shape of a royal crown over the well. An inscription on the monument reads: ::Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, and his Royal Highness the Prince Consort, visited this well and drank of its refreshing waters, on the 20th September, 1861, the year of Her Majesty's great sorrow. Andrew Jarret cautions againsting drinking from the well today; \\"To drink from the well now would be sheer folly as the water has been contaminated somewhat by the copper coins thrown into it by wish-makers and there is also the likelihood that some of the local sheep population have made deposits of their own\\". Balnamoon's Cave Entrance to Balnamoon's Cave James Carnegy- Arbuthnott, Laird of Balnamoon, favoured the Jacobite cause and was known as the Rebel Laird. He was Prince Charles Edward Stuart's Deputy-Lieutenant of Forfarshire and an officer in Lord Ogilvy's Angus regiment. He survived the Battle of Culloden in 1746 and fled to Glen Esk where he was harboured by locals until he was betrayed by the local Presbyterian minister. Sent for trial in London, he was acquitted on a misnomer. (In 1745 he had added his wife's surname and territorial designation of Arbuthnott of Findowrie to his own name, from whence arose the confusion). While outlawed, Balnamoon was actively sought by soldiers of the crown, as well as hired Highlanders. At times of greatest danger, when his pursuers were in the Angus glens, he hid out in a remote cave high in Glen Mark. The loyalty of the locals, the remote location and the difficulty in locating the small cave entrance among the rock strewn mountain sides, kept Balnamoon from being discovered and captured for a year.

History Following the acquisition of Tibidabo Amusement Park by the City of Barcelona, the park began an investment of 50 million Euros to improve the park. Among other actions, insalaron lift and created the Cam√≠ del Cel. It also created new attractions. In 2007 the project has been drawn to a large roller coaster in the middle of the forest. This created great unease among neighbours. In late 2007, the Netherlands Vekoma introduced the project, compometinedose to respect the environment and minimize environmental and visual impact. Marks in the trees fired alarms, and events created and collected signatures. On May in 2008 begins felling trees, and removed the attraction Transm√≥vil. At the end of summer in 2008 begins to bring the structure of the attraction. In December in 2008 are the first tests, and the attraction innagur√≥ on 23 December 2008 in the presence of Mayor of Barcelona Jordi Hereu. That same day, demonstrators gathered at the entrance to the park to protest the implementation of this attraction, and the alleged environmental damage they have caused the works. Since the opening of the attraction until the end of the season will be held open exclusively for members of the Tibiclub, the annual pass of Tibidabo, an hour and half before opening to the public. The ride The attraction is a roller coaster, manufactured by the Dutch company Vekoma without any inversions. After leaving the train station, it passes through a curve to the right to enter a small tunnel, where it starts rising 33 metres. When they reached the highest this is a test point of the attraction to 522 metres on the sea level, it makes a curve to the right, and starts to fall with a Barcelona and Maresme. After this, turn sharply left and makes a journey of 50 seconds in the woods Collserola, very peralted turns. The station is open (no roof), and is accessed via an oval-shaped ramp. The banda is the right boarding gates for 8 passengers, and the right to exit. Access to the queue area is through a small Cave man. The attraction features two trains exactly the same (except in color: one red and one blue). Each train has 4 cars, 2 lanes for 2 passengers, with a total capacity of 16 passengers per train. The attraction operates on a train when there is not much demand, if there are enough people, open up two trains, quetiene add a maximum capacity of 1010 passengers per hour. The safety bars enclave is via mechanical grip each passenger individually. The company B: SM, park manager, requested that the trains have a design of ancient attraction.

How platforms were created Tibidabo SOS and Salvem Collserola, to collect signatures, and even travelled to Brussels to oppose this appeal against the European Parliament. In April in 2008, a group of activists chained themselves to trees. In July in 2008, coinciding with the opening of the attraction MiraMiralls broke out. On 23 December 2008, coinciding with the attraction innaguraci√≥n, were at the gate of the park with banners and mask with the photo of Jordi Hereu.

Created by Ken Sugimori, Meowth first appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels. In addition, it was one of the Pok√©mon to get an Alolan Form variant of the Dark type. It now also has a Galarian Form, which is a Steel type. It later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Meowth is considered by many fans as Team Rocket's mascot because a Meowth that is able to speak a human language is a member of the Team Rocket Trio, together with two Team Rocket grunts called Jessie and James. Meowth is voiced by Inuko Inuyama in Japanese, and by Maddie Blaustein (dub episodes 33-419), and James Carter Cathcart (dub episodes 420 ‚Äì current) in English, and by Choi Weonhyeong (original series, all original movies up to M09), Park Jihoon (Advanced Generation series), and Oh Inseong (later Advanced Generation series ‚Äì present, and all redubbed movies) in Korean. Known as the Scratch Cat Pok√©mon, it spends most of the daytime sleeping and prowls the city streets at night. Meowth evolves into Persian in Kanto and Alola and Perrserker in Galar. Meowth is considered as rival of the pok√©mon mascot Pikachu and also has the opposite pokedex no. of that of Pikachu(It's pokedex no. is 52 and Pikachu's is 25). Meowth is among the most recognizable Pok√©mon, largely because it is a central character in the Pok√©mon anime series. This particular Meowth, belonging to Team Rocket, the anime's main antagonists, is one of the few Pok√©mon that have the ability to speak human language. The episode \\"Go West Young Meowth\\" shows the character's backstory, in which Meowth attempted to impress a female Meowth called Meowzie ( in Japanese version) by teaching himself how to walk on two legs and speak human language, but it ended up alienating Meowzie. In the English version of the franchise, Meowth speaks with a Brooklyn accent. The character has received a mixed reception, Game Daily describing him as \\"adorable\\" and saying he should have his own game, while GamesRadar described it as \\"not all that useful\\" and said that Meowth would not have stood out if it did not have such a large role in the anime. Design and characteristics Meowth's design was inspired by the Japanese good luck charm maneki-neko Meowth was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pok√©mon Red and Blue. Called \\"Nyarth\\" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pok√©mon species \\"clever and descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. Due to its appearance in the anime series as a speaking character, the species was renamed Meowth, a combination of the words \\"meow\\" and \\"mouth\\". Meowth has a distinctly feline appearance, resembling a small housecat. It has cream-colored fur, which turns brown at its toes and tail tip. Its oval-shaped head features prominent whiskers, black-and-brown ears, and a koban, a gold, oval coin (also known as a \\"charm\\") embedded in its forehead. Meowth are valued for their ability to collect coins using their signature move, \\"Pay Day\\", as it is the only Pok√©mon that learns it. Meowth's coloration, its love of coins, and its charm indicate that Meowth is based on the Japanese Maneki Neko, a cat-shaped figurine that is said to bring good luck and money to its owner. Aspects of Meowth were drawn from a Japanese myth dealing with the true value of money, in which a cat has money on its head but does not realize it. When a Meowth receives enough experience from battles, it evolves into Persian at level 28. Meowth is an urban nocturnal Pok√©mon, spending most of the daytime sleeping and prowling the city streets at night. They retract their claws back into their paws, which grants them silent movement and protecting them from leaving distinctively incriminating pawprints that alert people to their actions. Meowth loves round objects, as well as shiny, glittering things. The item it adores collecting the most, however, are coins, since they are both round and shiny. Meowth collects the objects at every opportunity and hoards in its nest. Murkrow, a Pok√©mon similar to the bowerbird, exhibits similar behavior and members of the two species have been known to steal from the collections of the other. Appearances=In the video games= Artwork for the noticeably different Alolan Meowth, introduced to the series in Sun and Moon Meowth first appeared as a version exclusive Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Blue. It later appeared in several sequels, including Pok√©mon Silver, Pok√©mon Crystal, the Red and Blue remakes Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen, Pok√©mon Emerald, Pok√©mon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, and Pok√©mon SoulSilver. Meowth is one of the playable characters in the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon games. Meowth also appears in the Nintendo 64 game Pok√©mon Snap, the Nintendo GameCube game Pok√©mon Channel, and many others. Meowth has appearances in the Super Smash Bros. series (excluding Melee) as a Pok√©mon summoned via a Pok√© Ball item and uses its signature move, Pay Day, to throw a barrage of coins. In Pok√©mon Sun and Moon, Meowth has a unique Alolan Form, which is Dark-type. Alolan Meowth were owned by Alolan royalty in the past, resulting in them having selfish and prideful attitudes, which caused their form to change. Pok√©mon Sword and Shield introduces another form of Meowth, including a new regional evolution. The original Kantonian Meowth has a unique Gigantamax form and equipped with original Meowth anime voice, the third form being its Galar form, which has an exclusive evolved form instead of Persian, known as Perrserker, in Japan as . In that Generation VIII game, the Galar Meowth's evolution line are described to be wildly savage and feral, and has a black forehead coin than the other Meowth forms‚Äô evolution lines. =In the anime= A specific male Meowth has made an appearance in almost every episode in the anime as the constant companion of Team Rocket agents Jessie and James, the show's bungling main antagonists. He has a New York City-like accent. He originally lived in the city, and tried to impress a female Meowth named Meowzie by learning to walk on two legs and speak human language. Instead of being impressed, she regarded him as a freak, so Meowth joined Team Rocket. Meowth was cloned in Pok√©mon: The First Movie, but his clone could not talk or walk on two legs, likely because Meowth needed to learn how to perform these actions. The Meowth clone is encountered again in Pok√©mon: Mewtwo Returns. In the episode \\"Meowth‚Äôs Scrafty Tactics!\\" (S14E43) Meowth temporarily joined the protagonists Ash, Iris, and Cilan, stating that he was fired from Team Rocket for his part in a failed mission, but in reality he was lying in order to gain their trust as part of an elaborate attempt to steal Pok√©mon from the Nimbasa City Pok√©mon Center. Despite his frequent appearances, Meowth is a wild Pok√©mon, which makes him eligible for capture. Iris, Ash‚Äôs travel companion, and Cliff, a forest ranger, attempted to capture him because they desired the convenience of a Pok√©mon that could translate to human language. However, since he does not wish to be owned by anyone, he refutes these attempts at capture. Because Meowth exerted so much effort into being able to talk, he doesn't know how to perform \\"Pay Day\\" (his species trademark move), and is permanently unable to do so. A trainer named Tyson owns a Meowth, which beat Ash's Pikachu in the Ever Grande Conference. This Meowth was dressed up like Puss in Boots. =In other media= Meowth appears in The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga series along with his teammates Jessie and James. He first appears in the chapter Pikachu's Excellent Adventure. In Days of Gloom and Glory, an unnamed Meowth based on Meowzie appears. Like in the anime, Meowzie finds Meowth's ability to speak human language \\"creepy\\". In the manga, she has at least one kitten, which she captures into a stolen Pok√© Ball to protect it from an impending flood. In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, Meowth's first appearance is a cameo in the first chapter as one of the Pok√©mon that escapes from Professor Oak's Laboratory. Meowth has appeared in the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game first in the Jungle series. A special Meowth card was available with purchase of Pok√©mon Trading Card Video Game. In an open forum interview with ABC News, Pok√©mon anime director Masakazu Kubo noted Meowth as his favorite Pok√©mon, citing that while not a major character in the games, he was in the anime. Critical reception Meowth ranked fourth on Game Daily's top 10 list of Nintendo characters that deserve their own games, describing him as \\"adorable\\" and explaining that his intelligence and ability to speak gave him more depth than other Pok√©mon. IGN stated that without the anime, the character would not have been as famous, further describing it as \\"probably the funniest part of the show\\". San Francisco Gate editor Jesse Hamlin stated that Meowth provided a few laughs in Pok√©mon The Movie 2000. However, another editor stated it was popular amongst people who have never seen the anime due to being a feline. Author Harry Schlesinger wrote that Meowth was popular among girls. IGN said that Meowth would make a good choice as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl \\"if Brawl's developers really wanted much more representation for Pokemon as a franchise\\" also stating \\"it would be fun to face him in battle as a real fighter, just to be able to send him 'blasting off again.'\\" GamesRadar described Meowth as \\"not all that useful\\", and questioned if the character would have stood out if it were not for its portrayal in the anime. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson described Meowth as being \\"no slouch\\" compared to Snorlax, who she described as the greatest Pok√©mon ever. Fellow GamesRadar editor Justin Towell listed Meowth as one of video games' eight greatest Pok√©mon, describing him as one of the most memorable characters in the series. Authors Tracey West and Katherine Noll called Meowth the number one Normal type Pok√©mon and the tenth best Pok√©mon overall. They called its anime incarnation the \\"heart and soul of Team Rocket\\", and praised it as \\"funny and clever\\".

He served on the staff of Senator Robert Dole from 1987 until 1995, when he was again appointed Parliamentarian of the United States Senate. In 2001, he determined that Senate rules allow only one budget bill per year related to revenue to be immune from filibuster. Provisions in a reconciliation bill, one provided for in section 310 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, may be deleted because the Parliamentarian may find it only has policy implications and no budgetary implications, and hence be subject to a point of order. Later that year, Dove ruled to remove a Republican provision to allocate over $5 billion in the 2002 budget for natural disasters. Following Republican anger about these rulings, he was dismissed by Republican Majority Leader Trent Lott. He was again replaced by Alan Frumin.

Established in 2002, the Thebans are based at Edinburgh's Murrayfield Stadium and have over 50 registered players. The club supports its players and supporters - whether gay or straight, experienced or new to the game - to enjoy rugby at a competitive level. Through twice-weekly coaching sessions and regular matches against both mainstream and inclusive clubs (whose members are often drawn from the LGBT community), the Thebans aim to develop confident players and encourage participation in rugby union from groups who may have been under-represented in the sport.  History  The Thebans was formed as a club primarily for gay and bisexual men who wanted to play rugby, but may have lacked the confidence to join a mainstream team. The club came to life on 18 May 2002 when Colm Cunningham, a gay man from Northern Ireland, put up a poster in the Laughing Duck - a now defunct Edinburgh gay bar. In 2006 the club became more performance orientated. Since then, the Thebans have gone from strength to strength and now benefit from extensive facilities at Roseburn Park. The club's playing squad now also includes a diverse mix of gay, bisexual and straight players - reflecting the Thebans' aim of promoting inclusion and encouraging participation in the game. In February 2016, the club played its first competitive fixture against Glasgow Alphas RUFC, the second inclusive team to be formed in Scotland.  International competition  Caledonian Thebans RFC has represented Scotland at international tournaments for inclusive clubs since 2002. The Thebans have been most successful at the biennial Union Cup, the European championships for inclusive teams. In the 2014 tournament, held in Brussels, a strong Thebans squad finished as runners-up in the Silver Plate final - losing 8-7 to hosts Straffe Ketten. May 2016 saw the Thebans travel to Nashville, Tennessee to fight for inclusive rugby's world cup, the Bingham Cup, which takes place every second year. Unable to attend the 2014 tournament, held in Sydney, the Thebans are raising funds to send a full squad to Bingham 2020 to ensure Scotland is once again represented in this global competition. In 2016 we won the Hoagland Cup in Nashville, Tennessee. Affiliation The Thebans are affiliated to the Scottish Rugby Union and are also part of umbrella club Murrayfield Wanderers RFC, with whom the club has built strong ties. The Thebans are also part of the International Gay Rugby Association and Board. Name The club's name is a reference to the Sacred Band of Thebes, an elite and highly successful military unit in the Theban army of ancient Greece, which was made up of male couples.Paul Walter Ludwig, Eros and Polis: Desire and Community in Greek Political Theory. Cambridge, 2002. The Sacred Band of Thebes was completely annihilated, however, by Alexander the Great under Philip II of Macedon in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC.

Emperor Sh≈çwa at his enthronement in 1928. Emperor Akihito wore the sokutai at the enthronement ceremony in November 1990. The is an ancient ceremony that marks the accession of a new monarch to the Chrysanthemum Throne, the world's oldest continuous hereditary monarchy. Various ancient imperial regalia are given to the new sovereign during the course of the rite. Ceremonies The Japanese enthronement ceremony consists of three main parts: =Presentation of the Three Sacred Treasures= Presentation of the sword Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi and the Yasakani no Magatama at the enthronement of Emperor Akihito, 1989 The first is the simplest, Kenji-t≈ç-Sh≈çkei-no-gi (Ââ£ÁíΩÁ≠âÊâøÁ∂ô„ÅÆÂÑÄ), it takes place immediately after the death or abdication of the preceding sovereign. The successor is formally presented with boxes containing two of the three items that compose the Imperial Regalia of Japan: (1) a replica sword representing the sword Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (lit. \\"Grasscutter Sword\\") (ËçâËñôÂäç), though the original is allegedly enshrined at Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya; and (2) the Yasakani no magatama (ÂÖ´Â∞∫ÁìäÊõ≤Áéâ), a necklace of comma-shaped stone beads. The third and most important of the items of the regalia is the mirror Yata no Kagami (ÂÖ´Âí´Èè°), which is enshrined in the Ise Grand Shrine as the go-shintai (Âæ°Á•û‰Ωì), or the embodiment of the Sun Goddess herself. It is permanently housed in the shrine, and is not presented to the emperor for the enthronement ceremony. Imperial messengers and priests are sent to this shrine, as well as to the tomb-shrines of the four emperors whose reigns immediately preceded his, to inform them of the new emperor's accession. The three items of the imperial regalia were originally said to have been given by the Sun goddess, Amaterasu, to her grandson when he first descended to earth and became the founder of the imperial dynasty. Unlike other monarchies, Japan has no crown in its regalia. In the 2019 enthronement ceremony, the treasures were presented to the new emperor in the morning of his ascension date. The visits to the Ise Grand Shrine by Imperial messengers and priests, as well as to the tombs of the previous four emperors, continued on as in past enthronements. =Enthronement= Takamikura used for the Enthronement. Banzai banner used for the enthronement ceremony. The second part of the ceremony, called Sokuirei-Seiden-no-gi (Âç≥‰ΩçÁ§ºÊ≠£ÊÆø„ÅÆÂÑÄ), is the enthronement ritual itself; the last such ceremony was held in 2019 for Naruhito. This ancient rite was traditionally held in Kyoto, the former capital of Japan; beginning in 1990, it is done in Tokyo. The 1990 enthronement of Akihito was the first to be covered on television, and have Imperial Guards in traditional uniforms. It was done indoors, with the elevated stand placed inside the Imperial Palace complex. Only part of the ritual is public, and the regalia itself is generally seen only by the emperor and a few Shinto priests. First came a three-hour ceremony in which the new emperor ritually informed his ancestors that the enthronement is about to take place. This was followed by the enthronement itself, which takes place per tradition in an enclosure called the Takamikura, containing a great square pedestal upholding three octagonal pedestals topped by a simple chair. This was surrounded by an octagonal pavilion with curtains, surmounted by a great golden Phoenix. At the same time, the empress, in full dress regalia, moved to a smaller adjacent throne beside her husband's. Traditional drums were, at this point of the ceremony, beaten to start the proceedings. The new emperor proceeded to the chair, where after being seated, the Kusanagi, Yasakani no Magatama, privy seal and state seal were placed on stands next to him. A simple wooden sceptre was presented to the emperor, who faced his prime minister standing in an adjacent courtyard, representing the Japanese people. The emperor offered an address announcing his accession to the throne, calling upon his subjects to single- mindedly assist him in attaining all of his aspirations. His prime minister replied with an address promising fidelity and devotion, followed by a \\"three cheers of Banzai\\" from all of those present. The timing of this last event was precisely synchronized, so that Japanese around the world could join in the \\"Banzai\\" shout at precisely the moment that it was being offered in Kyoto or in Tokyo. This moment of the rite ends with the firing of a 21-gun salute by the Japan Self-Defense Forces. After this, both seals and the two regalia items are carried off the imperial pavilion. Following this, the emperor and empress, now back to wearing civilian mess dress, are then both driven all over Tokyo via the Imperial automobile convoy to acknowledge the cheers of the people of the capital and tourists assembled on the major streets. On the way the emperor receives his first salute as head of state by police personnel of the Imperial Guard and the 302nd JGSDF Security Company of the Eastern Army, the JSDF's official guard of honour formation, and then by a joint service guard of honour battalion of guardsmen from the headquarters units of the JSDF's three service branches, which present arms and salute on the eyes left. In the past, in his former role as commander-in-chief, he received the salutes of the Imperial Guard formations and assembled formations of both the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy either during the motorcade or while mounted on horseback. =The Daij≈ç-sai= The Daij≈ç-sai of Emperor Akihito in 1990 The Daij≈ç-sai (Â§ßÂòóÁ•≠), the first Niiname-sai (Êñ∞ÂòóÁ•≠) or the Great Thanksgiving Festival, is the third and most important of the inauguration rituals, because it is the one in which the emperor is united to the sun- goddess Amaterasu, in such a way as to share in a unique way in her divinity. The emperor and empress both perform the Daijosai ceremony a few months after ascending the throne. It is only performed once during their reign. Akihito performed it in November 1990 and Naruhito on 14 November 2019. The purpose is to give thanks and pray for national peace and prosperity. The emperor offers gifts such as rice, kelp, millet and abalone. Then he reads an appeal to the gods and eats the offering and prays. The emperor and empress perform the rites separately. It takes about 3 hours. Over 500 people are present including the Prime Minister, government officials and representatives of society. It originates as a shinto rite from at least the 7th century. It is an event by the Imperial Household so it doesn't violate the separation of church and state. A special complex with over 30 structures are built for the event. Afterward, they are accessible to the public for a few weeks and then dismantled. In 1990, the ritual costed more than 2.7 billion yen ($24.7 million). Details First, two special rice paddies are chosen and purified by elaborate Shinto purification rites. The families of the farmers who are to cultivate the rice in these paddies must be in perfect health. Once the rice is grown and harvested, it is stored in a special Shinto shrine as its go-shintai (Âæ°Á•û‰Ωì), the embodiment of a kami or divine force. Each kernel must be whole and unbroken, and is individually polished before it is boiled. Some sake is also brewed from this rice. The two sets of rice seedlings now blessed each come from the western and eastern prefectures of Japan, and the chosen rice from these is assigned from a designated prefecture each in the west and east of the country, respectively. Two thatched roof two-room huts are built within a corresponding special enclosure, using a native Japanese building style that predates and is thus devoid of all Chinese cultural influence. One room contains a large couch at its center; the second is used by musicians. All furniture and household items also preserve these earliest, and thus most purely Japanese forms: e.g., all pottery objects are fired but unglazed. These two structures represent the house of the preceding emperor and that of the new emperor. In earlier times, when the head of a household died his house was burned; before the founding of Kyoto, whenever an emperor died his entire capital city was burned as a rite of purification. As in the earlier ceremony, the two houses represent housing styles from western and eastern parts of Japan. Since 1990, the temporary enclosure is located at the eastern grounds of the Imperial Palace complex. Ritual items from the enthronement of the Japanese emperor After a ritual bath, the emperor is dressed entirely in the white silk dress of a Shinto priest, but with a special long train. Surrounded by courtiers (some of them carrying torches), the emperor solemnly enters first the enclosure and then each of these huts in turn and performs the same ritual‚Äîfrom 6:30 to 9:30 PM in the first, and in the second from 12:30 to 3:30 AM on the same night. A mat is unrolled before him and then rolled up again as he walks, so that his feet never touch the ground. A special umbrella is held over the sovereign's head, in which the shade hangs from a phoenix carved at the end of the pole and prevents any defilement of his sacred person coming from the air above him. Kneeling on a mat situated to face the Grand Shrine of Ise, as the traditional gagaku court music is played by the court orchestra the emperor makes an offering of the sacred rice, the sake made from this rice, millet, fish and a variety of other foods from both the land and the sea, to Amaterasu. Then he eats some of this sacred rice himself, as an act of divine communion that consummates his singular unity with Amaterasu-≈çmikami, thus making him (in Shinto tradition) the intermediary between Amaterasu and the Japanese people. This is followed by three banquets and a visit to the shrines of his ancestors.

It was underpowered and so did not leave the water easily, but it proved that watertight and corrosion-resistant hulls could be built from metal. Development From about 1921, Oswald Short had been thinking about the construction of seaplane floats and flying boat hulls made from metal, specifically duralumin, rather than the traditional wood. The latter always suffered from water retention and did not last well in the tropics. He assembled a team, including C. P. T. Liscomb who had extensive experience with that alloy to look into the hydrodynamics and corrosion characteristics of such hulls, and by 1924 was looking out for an opportunity to apply their results. It came with an Australian order for an aircraft suitable for fishing trips around Botany Bay, which Short proposed should be a small flying boat. It was named the Stellite and was the first aircraft to have a Short's design index number, S.1. When it was built and registered as G-EBKA the Air Ministry objected to the name on the reasonable grounds that the Short Stellite might well be confused with the Short Satellite, built at much the same time; it was therefore renamed the Short S.1 Cockle. It was the smallest flying boat ever built at that time. A contemporary source claimed it to be \\"the first light seaplane to be built [in the United Kingdom] and possibly in the world\\" and the first British all-metal flying boat. The Cockle Flight 17 April 1924 pp. 220-3 was an all-metal aircraft apart from the fabric-covered flying surfaces. The hull was a duralumin monocoque structure with a concave V-shaped planing bottom incorporating two steps, the main one near the centre of gravity. These steps were external to the monocoque to prevent step damage leading to water leakage into the hull. The top of the hull was rounded, with a single-seat open cockpit near the nose. The wings had steel spars and were mounted on the top of the fuselage, with pairs of bracing struts to the chines. The wings carried full-span ailerons which could be drooped together, flap-like, for landing. There were stabilising floats near the wingtips in trouser-like fairings. The two engines were mounted on top of the wing at about mid-chord, the twin-bladed propellers being driven via long extension shafts to the leading edge. Originally the Cockle had a shallow triangular fin and rudder, Flight 17 April 1924 p. 221 Flight 11 December 1924 p. 778 but this was later extended upwards to a curved and slightly pointed profile which more than doubled the area, to cope better with single-engine flying. A tube ran transversely across the hull just above the main step, into which the axle of a pair of ground-handling wheels could be inserted. Flight 17 April 1924 p. 223 Deterred from using 32 hp (24 kW) Bristol Cherub flat- twin engines owing to vibration problems, the Cockle began with a pair of V-twin Blackburne Tomtits. Ungeared and so limited to the maximum 2,400 rpm of the propellers, the Tomtits could produce only 16 hp (12 kW). It is not surprising that, when it came to the first flight, the Cockle was underpowered. Before the aircraft was complete the bare hull (always Short's main concern) was floated for a day in April 1924 and found to be satisfactorily watertight. Flight 17 April 1924 p. 222 Attempts to get it off the water began in September, but did not succeed until 7 November 1924, with its wing at a higher angle of incidence and its pilot lightly dressed. It has been suggested that it flew only because the atmospheric pressure was exceptionally high that day. Given the poor performance, it is not surprising that the Australian customer declined delivery. In January 1925 the fin and rudder modifications were made and in March there were unsuccessful attempts to get certification. In July it went on loan to the Air Ministry at Felixstowe, with the serial N193. It was not easy to get into the air, but John Parker, Short's test pilot gave a demonstration in September. Despite the performance limitations, the aircraft impressed because of its corrosion resistance. In August 1926 the Cockle was returned to Short Brothers and re- engined with a pair of geared-down Cherubs. It flew several times in June and July before being purchased by the Air Ministry and returned to Felixstowe. It flew at least one more time, again with Parker as pilot, thereafter being used for corrosion testing. Though not a successful flyer, the Cockle gave Short Brothers valuable experience in building metal hulls for flying boats. Their first large hull, the Short S.2 metal replacement for the wooden hull of a Felixstowe F5 was started at the same time as that of the Cockle, but the smaller hull progressed faster and the solution to problems encountered with it transferred to the S.2. The S.2 experience led on to the successful Singapore and Short Calcutta of 1926 and 1928.

Location Located at and within 10 km from Jangipur on NH-34 close to where the river Ganges enters Bangladesh on one side; and within 10 km in the Indian side of the Indo-Bangladesh border, Giria is located in the alluvial sediment plain if the river Ganges and Bhagirathi. It falls in the modern day district of Murshidabad in the state of West Bengal, India. The Battles= Background = Alivardi Khan the then Subahdar of Azimabad was not satisfied with the position of Governor and had always harboured ambitions of becoming the Nawab of Bengal and had real ambitions of deposing Sarfaraz Khan. He was willingly aided and abetted in this treacherous activity by his brother Haji Ahmed. To effect this, he required an imperial commission directed to himself, empowering him to wrest the three provinces out of the hands of the present viceroy, Sarfaraz Khan. After having dispatched these letters, he gave out that he intended marching against the zamindars of Bhojpur, and under that pretence he mustered his troops, which he always kept in constant readiness. At the same time, he had the art to give Sarfaraz Khan public notice of his project, though he in reality waited ready to avail himself of the first opportunity to effect his true purpose. Eventually, ten months after Nadir Shah's departure for Persia, and just thirteen months after Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan's death, he received the imperial commission, drawn up in the style he had requested. Being now resolved on marching against Sarfaraz Khan, he wrote secretly to Jagat Seth Fateh Chand that on a certain day he would commence his march. In March, 1740; Alivardi Khan, set out for Murshidabad, on the context of expedition to Bhojpur, and encamped at some distance from the city of Patna. Alivardi Khan, in a message to Sarfaraz Khan, suggested that he was not marching on him but was arriving to pay homage to the Nawab. Initially satisfied, Sarfaraz Khan eventually decided to march on the head of his army and arrived at the town of Comrah on 9 April 1740. Alivardi, in the interim, secured the Teliagarhi pass and camped at Rajmahal. The Nawab's army was being led by a seasoned general, Ghaus Khan. Ray-Rayan, and Alam Chand also accompanied him. The rebel army was being led by Alivardi Khan with Nandalal and Nawazish Muhammad Khan as his deputies.

The rock formation is so named for the visual effect of a \\"hump\\" it creates on the western face of the mountain. Located six miles (10 km) south of the northern entrance to the Blue Ridge Parkway near Waynesboro, Virginia, Humpback Rock stands out from many other mountain summits in the Blue Ridge due to its exposed rocky summit, in contrast to the heavily vegetated peaks of surrounding mountains. The location features a well-maintained trail and visitor's center. Geology As is the case for most of the surrounding mountains, such as Old Rag Mountain, Humpback Rock is underlain by an enormous granite formation created during the Grenville Orogeny on the ocean floor about a billion years ago. About 400 million years later, during the Catoctin Formation, basaltic magma was deposited, forming a layer of greenstone over the granite. Over time, sand and rock sedimented on the ocean floor, forming quartzite and sandstone deposits. Finally, sedimentation of shells and skeletons of foraminifera resulted in deposition of a layer of limestone. Approximately 700 million years after the Grenville Orogeny, the Iapetus Ocean began to close, resulting in the Alleghenian Orogeny, where slabs of granite and rock were transported westward and eventually thrust up over the limestone bed around it, forming Humpback Rock and the Blue Ridge Mountains.

In Scandinavia, Voddler was primarily known for the commercial VOD-service Voddler, which was launched in 2009. As a company, Voddler was founded in 2005 and developed its own streaming solution, called Vnet. Vnet is based on peer-to-peer (p2p), where all users contribute by streaming movies to each other, but, unlike traditional p2p, Vnet has a central administrator who decides which users that have access to which movies. Due to this exception, Vnet has been referred to as a \\"hybrid p2p distribution system\\", \\"walled garden p2p\\" or \\"controlled p2p\\". In addition to running the consumer service Voddler, the company Voddler also offers, since 2013, Vnet as a stand-alone technology for other streaming platforms. The service Bollyvod, a global VOD-service for Bollywood-content that Voddler built for the Indian movie industry, was released as a pilot in 2014. Voddler Group went bankrupt in January 2018.  Voddler's streaming technology Vnet  Vnet logotype Voddler's streaming technology, called Vnet by the company, is a peer-to-peer-based video content delivery solution. With p2p-streaming, movies are not streamed from a central server or content delivery network (CDN), but from other users who have parts of the movie on their units after seeing the movie earlier. This process begins when a user clicks play for a movie and continues throughout the viewing time, allowing for seamless viewing. After the viewer has completed watching the video, parts of the video file remains for a time on the user's device. Popular content, that is watched by many other users, remain longer on any one user's device than less popular content, which more quickly is removed from the network nodes. Compared to server-based streaming, p2p-based streaming saves on data costs for the service provider, at the same time as the distribution becomes more robust, since it only grows stronger with every additional user. What distinguishes Vnet from traditional p2p is that Vnet allows an administrator to have central control over which movies are in the network and which users that can see them. Publishing into the network and access to the network is thus centrally controlled. The Vnet client is a separate application that uses closed source proprietary code from Voddler and is run as background daemon or service). Vnet is a patented solution with 28 patent in two patent families.  Voddler's own VOD-service  The VOD-service Voddler, which is accessible via web browsers and apps in selected markets, allows registered users with a broadband connection to stream movies and TV-shows over the public Internet. The service was released in beta in Sweden on 28 October 2009, initially only for customers of Swedish ISP Bredbandsbolaget. After requiring users to have an invitation to the service during the first months, Voddler was fully opened in Sweden on 1 July 2010 and soon thereafter in Norway, Denmark and Finland. The content catalog was initially completely free to the users and monetized via advertising. The catalog soon, however, became a mix of free movies (ad-funded or AVOD); rental movies (pay-per-view or TVOD); films that were part of a package (subscription or SVOD); and titles for purchase (Electronic Sell-Through or EST). The catalog contains primarily Hollywood- and other American titles, together with Scandinavian movies, primarily Swedish. Voddler built its catalog through license agreements with content owners such as Warner Bros., Paramount, Sony and Disney, including subsidiaries such as Touchstone Pictures and Miramax Films. According to the company itself, Voddler reached over 1 million registered users in the Nordics, and also opened the service in Spain in 2012. To users in Spain, the catalog was more limited than in the Nordics. = Player and software clients = Voddler's first media player client required a separate download and its graphical 10-foot user interface was primarily designed for the living-room TV with a remote control, instead of a desktop computer interface. In March 2010, Voddler updated the interface to allow for mouse and keyboard control, both for selecting movies and for playing them in the Voddler media player. This first mediaplayer was based on the GNU Public Licensed (GPL) source code of XBMC Media Center, a free and open-source software, that Voddler used as its application framework for the media player. After a controversy in 2010 surrounding the source code for Voddler's video player (see below under \\"GPL controversy\\"), Voddler changed the framework for its player and has based it since then on Adobe Flash and Adobe Air, both of which are not open source code. At about the same time, Voddler also stopped demanding a separate download of the media player and instead started using a player that was embedded directly into the browser page. This new player, just like the old one, takes it stream from Voddler's streaming cloud Vnet. = Mobile units = On 23 June 2011, Voddler announced the launch of an Android app. Subsequently, Voddler also released apps for iPhone, iPad, Windows Phone, SymbianSymbian och MeeGo. Starting in 2013, Voddler has increasingly started to use browser-based streaming instead of building dedicated apps for each platform.  GPL controversy  For its first video player, which was based on the GNU Public Licensed (GPL) source code of XBMC Media Center, Voddler also developed its own encryption module, to protect the movies streamed via the player from unauthorized copying or downloading. On 24 February 2010, the company closed down the service, having been hacked by anonymous programmers who had recreated these missing code parts that Voddler had added to its media player. The missing code made it possible for other media player to attach to Voddler's own, so that the user could save the streamed films to their harddrive. This use case violated the licensing deals that Voddler had signed with the content owners. As motivation for their attack, the anonymous programmers said that Voddler, according to GPL, should have published the code for the encryption module back to the open source project. Voddler claimed they had met the requirements of GPL, which the anonymous group argued was wrong, insisting that Voddler had to distribute all of the Voddler source code needed to compile the Voddler player executable. When Voddler re-opened its service on 8 March 2010, it was with a new media player, no longer based on XBMC. Since encryption protection was essential for Voddler, in order to keep its content license agreements, and that giving the code module back to the open source project was tantamount to removing the encryption, Voddler chose to completely replace the player with a commercially available framework.  The Company  Voddler Sweden AB is a venture-backed, privately held company, based in Stockholm, Sweden. The company was founded 2005 by Martin Alsen, Magnus Dalhamn and Mattias Bergstr√∂m and held for a while offices also in Palo Alto and Beijing. The company was reorganized in 2008 and investors Marcus Starberger and Mathias Hjelmstedt invested in Voddler Inc. Marcus Starberger and Mathias Hjelmstedt took their place as new founders and marked a new era for streaming services, video on demand (VOD). Marcus Starberger's background as a leading event producer in Europe as well as knowledge and skills in business benefits and structured and cost-effective product packaging for end customers and a broad network in the film industry gave Marcus Starberger a mandate to implement his vision for Voddler to stream films and TV series to end customers. The company is financially backed by venture capital companies such as Swedish Deseven and German Cipio Partners. Other investors include Nokia Growth Partners (Finland), Eqvitec (Finland), and Elisa Oyj (a Finnish telecommunications company). The company's CEO since 2009 is Marcus B√§cklund.

He is now known for his arguments against William Sherlock, who had justified the change of monarch of 1688‚Äì89 and his own switch of sides in The Case of the Allegiance. According to J. P. Kenyon, Kettlewell's reply made a case \\"with which conformist Anglicans could only agree, because it was spiritual, while Sherlock's was resolutely aspiritual\\".J. P. Kenyon, Revolution Principles: The Politics of Party 1689-1720 (1990), p. 28. He went on to attack defenders of the Glorious Revolution generally as proponents of fallacious contractarian theories.Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), article on Kettlewell, pp. 487-8. Life He was the second son of John Kettlewell, a merchant at Northallerton, Yorkshire, by his wife, Elizabeth Ogle, was born 10 March 1653, and was educated at Northallerton Grammar School under Thomas Smelt, a royalist, whose other pupils included George Hickes, William Palliser, Thomas Burnet, Thomas Rymer, and John Radcliffe. Kettlewell matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford on 11 November 1670, and graduated B.A. 20 June 1674. On Radcliffe's resignation of a fellowship at Lincoln College, Oxford, Kettlewell was elected in his place in July 1675, with the backing of George Hickes, then himself a Fellow. For about five years he acted as tutor in college, and proceeded M.A. 3 May 1677. He was ordained deacon by John Fell in Christ Church Cathedral 10 June 1677, and priest 24 February 1678. The reputation which his first book made for him led to his appointment as chaplain to Anne, Countess of Bedford, and to his presentation by Simon Digby, 4th Baron Digby to the vicarage of Coleshill, Warwickshire (December 1682). He resigned his fellowship at Lincoln College on 22 November 1683, devoted himself to his parish, where he preached the high church doctrine of passive obedience. In 1685 Kettlewell married. Through the Glorious Revolution he preached strongly against rebellion; he adhered consistently to this principle, and was deprived of his vicarage in 1690. He moved to London, and spent the remainder of his life, occupied in the composition of devotional books and controversial tracts. Shortly before his death he proposed to Bishop Thomas Ken the establishment of a fund for the relief of the suffering deprived clergy; and circulars asking for subscriptions were issued. But the charitable scheme was regarded by the government as a seditious usurpation of authority, and prosecutions were instituted. Kettlewell died at his house in Gray's Inn Lane on 12 April 1695, at the age of 42. He was buried on 15 April in the church of All Hallows Barking, in the same grave in which William Laud had been interred, and was commemorated in a Latin inscription on a marble tablet erected by his widow at the east end of the church. At Kettlewell's funeral Ken officiated for the only time in public after his deprivation. Kettlewell had married at Whitchurch, near Reading, on 4 October 1685, Jane, daughter of Anthony Lybb of Hardwick House in the parish of Whitchurch; they had no children. His papers were entrusted by his widow to Robert Nelson, who published some of them. Works His first book, 'The Measures of Christian Obedience,' a summary of Christian morals as involved in obedience to the laws of the Gospel, was written between Christmas 1677 and Easter 1678, but was not published until 1681, when, at Hickes's suggestion, Kettlewell dedicated it to Henry Compton, bishop of London, but this dedication he suppressed after Compton had appeared in military array on behalf of the Prince of Orange. His second publication resulted from his parochial work; he was in the habit of preaching preparation-sermons before communion, eight or nine times in the year, and of these he printed a summary in 1683 under the title of An Help and Exhortation to Worthy Communicating, dedicating the book to Lord Digby. Shortly after the suppression of Monmouth's rebellion he preached a sermon, in his collected works with the title of Measures of Christian Subjection. As a supplement to his first book, that on Christian Obedience, he published in February 1687-8 his Practical Believer, which passed through many editions. Kettlewell's works are: * 'Measures of Christian Obedience,' 1681; 2nd edit. 1683-1684, 3rd 1696, 4th 1700, 5th 1709 (with portrait), 6th 1714. * 'Help and Exhortation to Worthy Communicating,' 1683; eight editions up to 1717, the fourth printed at Cambridge in 1701. * 'A Discourse explaining the Nature of Edification,' in a visitation sermon at Coventry, 1684. * 'A Funeral Sermon for the Lady Frances Digby,' 1684. * 'The Religious Loyalist;' a visitation sermon at Coleshill. 1686. * 'Sermon on Occasion of the Death of Simon, Lord Digby,' 1686. * 'The Practical Believer; or the Articles of the Apostles' Creed drawn out to form a true Christian's Heart and Practice,' two parts [anon., with initials J.

Feustel (January 2, 1884 - July 7, 1970) was an American Thoroughbred horse racing Hall of Fame trainer best known as the trainer of Man o' War. The August Belmont Years Born in Lindenhurst, NY, Feustel was only ten years old when he began working in the horse racing industry as a stable hand. At age twenty-four he became a professional trainer. He had a long association with August Belmont Jr., working as a lad at his stable and rising to the position of foreman. and head trainer. In 1913, Feustel conditioned Belmont's colt Rock View to American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse honors with wins in several major races including the Brooklyn Derby and the Travers Stakes. In 1914, August Belmont began winding down his racing operations and sold off a number of his runners. When the United States entered World War I, the sixty- five-year-old August Belmont Jr. joined the United States Army. While overseas he decided to liquidate his racing operations and Louis Feustel went out on his own, racing horses for himself before going to work as the head trainer for Sam Riddle's Glen Riddle Farm. Prior to the 1918 Saratoga auction of the Belmont horses, Feustel had urged Sam Riddle to purchase a yearling son of aa August Belmont horse he was very familiar with named Fair Play. Riddle, however, was not impressed enough by the young horse and balked at buying until his wife put added pressure on him. Man o' War Riddle's reluctant purchase was named Man o' War and Louis Feustel prepared the colt for the 1919 racing campaign at training facilities in Maryland. The trainer brought him along slowly and after making his debut in mid year, Man o' War won nine of his ten starts and earned American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt honors. In his three-year-old season, under Feustel's handling Man o' War won all ten of his starts. The term Triple Crown did not come into use until 1930 and in February 1920 Sam Riddle announced that Man o' War would not make the long train journey south to run in the Kentucky Derby. However, they won the Preakness in Baltimore, Maryland and set a new record in winning Elmont, New York's Belmont Stakes. In addition, he set records at New York tracks while winning the Dwyer, the Lawrence Realization and Withers Stakes. At the end of the year, Man o' War was retired to stud. His1920 earnings helped Louis Feustel become that year's leading money-winning trainer in the United States. Following its formation, both Feustel and the horse would be inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame and in the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, Man o' War was ranked Number one.  Later life  Relations between Louis Feustel and Sam Riddle became strained and near the end of June 1921 he made arrangements with his old employer, August Belmont, Jr., who had rebuilt his racing and horse breeding business, to prepare his yearlings for racing. Although Feustel won the May 1922 Newtown Stakes and Richmond Handicap with Sam Riddle's horses, by the end of the year he was once again training all of the August Belmont, Jr. stable. In 1924, Feustel conditioned Ladkin to his historic win in the International Special No. 2 over the European superstar, Epinard. August Belmont, Jr. died that year and Feustel was once again out on his own. In the latter part of the 1920s he began conditioning horses for newspaper publisher, Bernard Ritter and in the 1930s he trained a successful racing stable for Mrs. Elizabeth Graham Lewis. A serious automobile accident in February 1943 kept Louis Feustel out of racing for several months and in 1950, after forty-two years training horses, he retired. He and his wife eventually made their home in Pasadena, California. Following his wife's death, in the late 1960s Feustel was living with a son in Chicago. Louis Feustel died on July 7, 1970 at age eighty-six.

It is an active paleontological excavation site at which research and excavations are continuing. The area of Mammoth Site of Hot Springs enclose a prehistoric sinkhole that formed and was slowly filled with sediments during the Pleistocene era. The sedimentary fill of the sinkhole contains the remains of Pleistocene fauna and flora preserved by entrapment and burial within a sinkhole. As of 2016, the remains of 61 mammoths, including 58 North American Columbian and 3 woolly mammoths had been recovered. Mammoth bones were found at the site in 1974, and a museum and building enclosing the site were established. The museum now contains an extensive collection of mammoth remains.Agenbroad, L.D., 1994. \\"Geology, hydrology, and excavation of the site.\\" In Agenbroad, L.D. and Mead, J.I., eds., pp. 15-27. \\"The Hot Springs Mammoth Site: A Decade of Field and Laboratory Research in the Paleontology, Geology, and Paleoecology.\\" The Mammoth Site of South Dakota.

Formation During the Late Pleistocene, the sinkhole at Mammoth Site of Hot Springs formed when a cavern in the Minnelusa Limestone collapsed. This cavern collapse created a steep-sided sinkhole, that was about deep and by wide at the surface within a Pleistocene terrace underlain by Spearfish Shale. The sinkhole is the surface expression vertical breccia pipe provided a chimney-like path that allowed warm artesian water to percolate upward and fill the sinkhole with a steeply-sided pond. The bones of an Arctodus Simus, a Giant Short-Faced Bear. Taken at Mammoth Site, Hot Springs, South Dakota Based on observations from modern ponds and lakes, it is estimated that this pond slowly infilled with silt over a period of 350‚Äì700 years. The presence of worm burrows and mammoth footprints found throughout these sediments, demonstrate that the laminated sediments within this sinkhole accumulated slowly and contemporaneously along with the mammoth remains over a long period of time. Likely enticed by warm water and pond vegetation, mammoths entered the pond to eat, drink or bathe. Because of the steep sides of very slippery Spearfish Shale, mammoths were occasionally trapped as they were unable to find a foothold and climb out of the sinkhole during periods of low water. Trapped in the sinkhole, the mammoths ultimately died of starvation, exhaustion, or drowned in the pond. Cross-section of mammoth footprints at the Mammoth Site Eventually the sinkhole filled, and the artesian spring diverted to the lower elevation of Fall River, as the river cut deeper in the valley floor. Over thousands of years, the \\"hardened mud plug\\" inside the dried-up pond has remained stable. The surrounding sediment was subsequently eroded, leaving the sinkhole as a high point on the landscape. Paleontology Warm artesian-fed spring waters created a pond that was attractive to wildlife. Findings at the site include the remains of megafauna such as giant short-faced bears along with those of shrub oxen, American camel, llama, wolves, coyotes, birds, minks, ferrets, prairie dogs, voles, and moles. Invertebrate discoveries include several species of clams, snails, and slugs.Anonymous, 2008. List of recovered species at the Hot Springs Mammoth Site (85 species on January 2008), Mammoth Site of South Dakota. Inc. Hot Springs, South Dakota. The majority of the mammoth remains have been identified as those of Columbian Mammoths, although the remains of three Woolly mammoths have been found as well. Mammoths that slipped into the sinkhole found it difficult to escape. Researchers measuring the pelvic bones of the remains have determined that most of the victims were young males.Agenbroad, L.D., 1997. \\"This Land/South Dakota: Mammoth Site.\\" Natural History Magazine. (October 1997) 106(9):77-79. A hypothesis drawn from observations of modern elephants' matriarchal societies, in which these group members are expelled, concludes that this group was inclined to the risk-taking behavior that led to their entrapment.  Chronology  Initially, the Mammoth Site of Hot Springs, South Dakota was estimated to be about 20,000 years old. This estimate was made on the basis of the faunal remains that are found in association with the mammoth remains. The presence of the remains of Pleistocene bear, camel, antelope, and shrub-ox indicated to geologists and paleontologists that sinkhole at this site might be filled with Late Pleistocene, possibly terminal Pleistocene, sediments. Numerous attempts have been made to radiocarbon date these sediments. Initially, several attempts were made to radiocarbon date collagen from scrap mammoth bone recovered from the site. All of these attempts failed to recover sufficient collagen from the bone samples to allow dating of this fraction. Later, samples of the bone apatite (hydroxyapatite) fraction from mammoth bones were radiocarbon dated. Two samples of the heat treated apatite fraction yielded radiocarbon dates of 19,260¬±1520 B.P and 20,770¬±350 B.P. Samples of bone apatite, which were not heat treated, yielded radiocarbon dates of 21,000¬±700, 25,640¬±320, and 26,075+975/-790 B.P. A single sample of bone carbonate was radiocarbon dated at 36,960¬±1170 B.P. The circa 26,000 B.P. time frame has been widely used by researchers as the approximate the time that sediments and mammoths bones accumulated within the sinkhole within the Mammoth Site of Hot Springs. However, radiocarbon dates derived from bone apatite are now known to be highly unreliable and at best represent the minimum age of the bone datedMahan, S.A., Hanson, P.R., Mead, J., Holen, S., and Wilkins, J., 2016. ‚ÄúDating the Hot Springs, South Dakota Mammoth Sinkhole Site.‚Äù Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs. 48:7. doi: 10.1130/abs/2016AM-281798 Because of the limitations of radiocarbon dates derived from bone apatite, a tooth plate from a mammoth was dated and uranium series dating and sediments enclosing the mammoth bones were dated using thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). The tooth plate yielded a uranium series date of 128,966 B.P. The results of the TL dating were apparently never published and preliminary OSL ages indicate that the sinkhole and its associated sediments and mammoth bones are indeed older than 26 ka. Hunting bones  Museum  In 1974, a construction worker, George Hanson, unearthed unusual bones while the area was being prepared for a new subdivision. His son recognized one of the finds as a mammoth tooth. The landowner Phil Anderson agreed to further investigation, and a complete skull and tusk were found in 1974. Phil Anderson agreed to donate the entire bone bed and mineral rights to the nonprofit organization and along with the work performed by amateur and professional excavators, led to its status as a museum, and it was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1980. Initially the finds were mapped on a string grid; since then the mapping systems have increasingly relied on computerized technologies.Esker, D.A., 2009. ‚ÄúIt's All about Context - Remapping mammoth bone bed with ArcGIS.‚Äù Esri, ArcUser, Spring 2009. pp. 24-26. The Mammoth Site is a 501(c)-3 non-profit organization. The museum is open to the public. Earthwatch volunteers participate in excavations during July.

Violence across several states in northeastern Nigeria resulted in more than 1,000 dead, with around 700 killed in the city of Maiduguri alone, according to one military official. A government inquiry later found that, while long-standing tensions existed between Boko Haram and the Nigerian Security forces, the immediate cause of the violence stemmed from a confrontation between a group of sect members and joint tax forces located at custom bridge Gamboru ward in the city of Maiduguri. The Boko Haram members were en route to bury one of their members at the Gwange cemetery. The officers, part of a special operation to suppress violence and rampant crime in Borno State, demanded that the young men comply with a law requiring motorcycle passengers to wear helmets. They refused and, in the confrontation that followed, police shot and wounded several of the men. According to initial media reports, the violence began on 26 July when Boko Haram launched an attack on a police station in Bauchi State. Clashes between militants and the Nigeria Police Force erupted in Kano, Yobe and Borno soon after. But President Umaru Yar‚ÄôAdua disputed this version of events, claiming that government security forces had struck first. ‚ÄúI want to emphasize that this is not an inter-religious crisis and it is not the Taliban group that attacked the security agents first, no. It was as a result of a security information gathered on their intention ... to launch a major attack,\\" he said. Nigerian troops surrounded the home of Ustaz Mohammed Yusuf, the founder and spiritual leader of Boko Haram since 2002, in Maiduguri on 28 July after his followers had barricaded themselves inside. On July 30, the military captured Yusuf and transferred him to the custody of the police. They summarily executed him in public outside police headquarters. Islam Online suggests that politics, not religion, was the cause of the violence. People such as Christian pastor George Orjih were murdered specifically because they refused to convert to Islam. Prior to the clashes, many local Muslim leaders and at least one military official had warned the Nigerian authorities about the Boko Haram sect. Those warnings were reportedly ignored. Bauchi, Bauchi State On 26 July, more than 50 people were killed and several dozen were injured in Bauchi when a gun-battle erupted as a police station was attacked by 70 Nigerian Boko Haram sect members who possessed grenades and guns. One government soldier and 32 Boko Haram militants were killed in the aftermath of the initial attack. The government claimed that 39 militants had been killed, and confirmed the death of a soldier. The attack was initiated by Boko Haram after their leaders were detained by the police. Security forces retaliated by raiding the neighbourhoods where the group was entrenched. Isa Yuguda, State Governor of Bauchi, commented: \\"We have pre-empted the militants. Otherwise the situation would have been bad. I'm calling on all the people of Bauchi to be calm and be rest assured the situation has been brought under control.\\" Yuguda declared a night-time curfew, and the police maintained a visible profile. Businesses remained open in the area. Maiduguri, Borno State In July 2009, media reported that 100 bodies were found beside police headquarters in Maiduguri. Hundreds of people were leaving their homes to escape the violence. A jailbreak was reported but was not immediately confirmed. Several civilian corpses lay in the city's streets; witnesses said they had been shot after being pulled from their cars. The country's army and police were both on patrol and firing at suspects. On 28 July, Army soldiers reportedly launched an offensive on the compound of sect leader Mohammed Yusuf and a nearby mosque used by his followers in the Borno state capital of Maiduguri. Troops shelled Mohammed Yusuf's home in the city after Yusuf's followers barricaded themselves inside. Shots rained across the city. On 30 July, Nigerian security forces killed 100 Boko Haram militants in fighting in Maiduguri. Security forces fought their way into a mosque occupied by militants, raking the interior with machine gun fire. Elsewhere, Military and Police forces engaged militants in house-to-house fighting. It was initially reported that Boko Haram vice-chairman Abubakar Shekau had been killed, but he was later reported alive. Nigerian policemen were also killed. After the government declared Maidguri to be secured, Nigerian forces began setting up mortar positions to shell the remaining enemy compound. On 30 July, Yusuf was captured by the military and handed over to the police at the police headquarters in Maiduguri. Police officers summarily executed Yusuf inside the compound in full view of public onlookers. Police officials initially claimed that either Yusuf was shot while trying to escape or died of wounds sustained during a gun battle with the military. The police also executed other Boko Haram suspects, including Yusuf's father-in-law, outside the police headquarters. On 2 August, a group of women and children abducted by Boko Haram were found locked in a house in Maiduguri. The military said a total of 700 people were killed in Maiduguri during the clashes. The Red Cross later said that it had taken 780 bodies from the streets of the city to be buried in mass graves. Potiskum, Yobe State A gun battle lasting several hours took place in Potiskum. Boko Haram militants set a police station on fire using fuel-laden motorcycles. The police station burned to the ground, and as a result, a police officer and a fire safety officer were both killed. Police engaged the fighters and wounded several. Police arrested 23 fighters after the battle. According to Nigerian sources, 43 Boko Haram fighters were killed in a shootout near the city on 30 July. Wudil, Kano State Three people were killed in an attack in Wudil, and police forces made more than 33 arrests. Wudil's senior police officer was injured.

It contains about 330 tombs, about 160 of which were looted by grave robbers before archaeological research could be carried out. The cemetery resembles an oblong sand dune. From it the remains of more than 30 people, the earliest of whom lived around 4,000 years ago, have been excavated. The bodies, which have been buried in air-tight ox-hide bags, are so well-preserved that they have often been referred to as mummies. While the mummies appear to be mostly caucasoid, analysis of their genetic makeup has revealed that they represented an admixed population, that combined both West Eurasian and East Eurasian ancestry. Their paternal lineages were almost exclusively West Eurasian, while their maternal lineages were a mixture of east and west Eurasian. The Xiaohe cemetery complex contains the largest number of mummies found at any single site in the world to date. The bodies are likely to have been transported significant distances for burial at Xiaohe, as no contemporaneous settlement is known to have existed near the tomb complex. Archaeology The site of the cemetery; the vertical posts indicate the tomb locations =Discovery and early excavations= A local hunter named √ñrdek found the site around 1910. Later, in 1934, with √ñrdek's help, Swedish explorer and archeologist Folke Bergman located the site which he named √ñrdek‚Äôs Necropolis. The tomb complex appeared as a small oval mound, and the top of the burial mound was covered with a forest of erect wooden posts whose tops had been splintered by strong winds.Folke Bergman: Archaeological Researches in Sinkiang. Oar-shaped wooden monuments and wooden human figures were found at the site. The coffins were assembled over the bodies which had become mummified. Bergman excavated 12 burials and recovered approximately 200 artifacts that were transported back to Stockholm. Bergman noted the surprising resemblance in the clothing, especially the fringed loin- cloths, to Bronze Age grave finds in Denmark, but dismissed any direct connection. Small Europoid Mask, Lop Nur, China, 2000‚Äì1000 BC =Later excavations= In October 2003, an excavation project, organized by the Xinjiang Cultural Relics and Archaeology Institute, began at the site. A total of 167 tombs have been uncovered since the end of 2002, and excavations have revealed hundreds of smaller tombs built in layers. In 2006, a coffin wrapped with ox hide in the shape of a boat was found. It contained a remarkably intact mummy of a young woman, which came to be called the Beauty of Xiaohe (or Beauty of Loulan). =Description of the tombs= Each tomb is marked by a vertical poplar post near the upper end of the coffin. A skull or horn of an ox may be suspended from the post. The ends of the posts can be either torpedo-shaped or oar-shaped, representing the phallus and vulva respectively. The male burials were marked with the oar-shaped posts, while the female burials were marked with the phallic posts. Bows and arrows were found with the male burials. The posts and coffins may be painted red. Each coffin is made of two massive pieces of plank assembled over the body, resembling an overturned boat, and then covered with cowhides. A few special tombs containing females have an extra rectangular coffin on top covered with layers of mud. Small masks of human faces and wooden human figures may accompany the burials. Twigs and branches of ephedra were placed beside the body. Genetic studies Between 2009 and 2015, the remains of 92 individuals found at the Xiaohe Tomb complex were analyzed for Y-DNA and mtDNA markers. Genetic analyses of the mummies showed that the maternal lineages of the Xiaohe people originated from both East Asia and West Eurasia, whereas all of the paternal lineages had links to modern populations of West Eurasia. Mitochondrial DNA analysis, which reveals the maternal ancestry, showed that maternal lineages carried by the Xiaohe people include West Eurasian haplogroups H, K, U5, U7, U2e, T and R*; East Asian haplogroups B5, D and G2a; haplogroups of most likely Central Asian or Siberian origin C4 and C5; as well as typically South Asian haplogroups M5 and M*. On the other hand, nearly all (11 out of 12 - or around 92%) of surveyed paternal lines are of West Eurasian haplogroup R1a1, and one is of exceptionally rare basal paragroup K*. The geographic location of this admixing is unknown, although south Siberia is likely. According to a comment posted on 18 July 2014 by Hui Zhou, one of study's co-authors, the Xiaohe R1a1 lineages belonged to a specifically European branch rather than the more common Central Asian R-Z93.

She and Conrad became progenitors of the Salian dynasty. Life Liutgarde was the only daughter of King Otto I of Germany from his first marriage with Edith of England, half-sister of King √Üthelstan. To build closer ties to the Salian dynasty, King Otto in 947 married her off to Conrad the Red, whom he had installed as Duke of Lorraine three years before. The marriage was not particularly happy. Around 950 Liutgarde gave birth to a son, Otto of Worms. Her husband accompanied the king on his Italian campaign in 951; however, he fell out with Otto over the agreements made with King Berengar II. Liutgarde died at Mainz in 953, where Conrad the Red had joined the rebellion of her elder brother Duke Liudolf of Swabia and Archbishop Frederick. She was buried in St. Alban's Abbey, Mainz Next year, Duke Conrad finally submitted himself to the authority of King Otto and remained a loyal supporter; he died at the 955 Battle of Lechfeld. Liutgarde's brother Liudolf died two years later, while on campaign in Italy. Upon the death of Emperor Otto in 973, the Empire passed through his second wife Adelaide of Italy to their son Otto II. In turn, Liudolf's son Otto I was vested with the Duchy of Swabia, while Liutgarde's son Otto of Worms succeeded as Duke of Carinthia in 978. Upon the death of Emperor Otto III in 1002, Otto of Worms also appeared as a candidate in the royal election but renounced in favour of the Ottonian duke Henry IV of Bavaria, a grandson of Emperor Otto I's brother Duke Henry I.

Life =Early Life and Education= James Lewin was born the son of the merchant, Nathan Lewin (1852-1909) and Agathe Lewin (n√©e Wedel) (1853-1904) from Pomerania, Prussia. He was the third of five children. He attended the Sophien-Gymnasium school in Berlin. He then studied medicine and philosophy at the Friedrich-Wilhelms University from the winter semester of 1907. For one semester, he studied in Leipzig, where he attended lectures by Wilhelm Wundt and Wilhelm Wirth. Lewin received his doctorate in philosophy with a thesis on the subject of the French idealist pantheist, Nicolas Malebranche. This work is still cited today in philosophical works on the subject. In October 1913, Lewin received his license to practice medicine. He was then employed from November 1913 to May 1916 as an assistant to Ernst Simmerling at the lunatic hospital of the University of Kiel. After this, he moved to Leipzig and worked there as a medical assistant to Paul Flechsig at the University's Psychiatric and Mental Hospital, where he received a second doctorate in 1917.H. Steinberg , O. Somburg and G.R.B. Boocock \\"The German - Jewish psychiatrist James Lewin - A twice forgotten victim\\". Der Nervenarzt 2010 In this work he wrote about situational psychosesLewin, J. (1917) Ueber Situations-Psychosen. Ein Beitrag zu den transitorischen, insbesondere haftpsychotischen St√∂rungen. Ach Psychiatr Nervenkr 58:533-598. He married the soprano, Clara Abramowitz, in March 1917, and a son was born in Lichtenrade in December that year. At this time James Lewin was drafted for military service, likely to a medical unit. After the war, he opened a practice in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg, specializing in psychiatry and gynaecology. A second practice was opened in Berlin-Steglitz. Clara and James Lewin divorced in 1924. =Exile from Germany= As a Jewish doctor, Lewin lost his insurance licence at the end of April 1933 pursuant to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, and was forced to leave Germany. He initially intended to travel to Abyssinia, but decided to emigrate to France instead due to a heart condition. In December 1933, he wrote from Paris to ask the German authorities to transfer his finances. With the help of Agro-Joint and the OZE (Obshchestvo Zdravookhraneniia Evreev, or \\"Society for the Preservation of the Health of the Jewish Population\\"), Lewin was issued with a Soviet work visa on 14 February 1936, and secured a position as a senior research associate at the Scientific Research Institute of Psychiatry and Neuropathology of Vasily V. Kramer. He travelled to the USSR, eventually setting at Apartment 31 at 8 Medovyi Lane, Moscow. Lewin was granted Soviet citizenship on May 7, 1937. =Arrest and Death in the USSR= Agro-Joint workers and the doctors it had helped to resettle soon became targets for Stalinist purges under the so-called National Operations of the NKVD. Operational Order No. 00439, entitled ‚ÄúOn the Arrest of German Subjects Suspected of Espionage against the USSR‚Äù was issued on July 25, 1937, and mandated the arrest of current and former German citizens who had taken up Soviet citizenship. Later in the year, the order was expanded to include other ethnic Germans suspected of collaborating or spying for Germany. Initially, 15 refugee doctors from Crimea and Chelyabinsk were arrested and accused of \\"collaboration with a counterrevolutionary organization\\". They were alleged to have received from Agro-Joint ‚Äúa special assignment to organize acts of bacteriological diversion on a territory of the USSR‚Äù. They were charged with participation in a counterrevolutionary terrorist organization consisting of Agro-Joint workers and doctor-microbiologists who aimed to assassinate members of the Soviet government. After these initial arrests, the NKVD of Chelyabinsk Oblast requested the arrest of colleagues of these doctors from Moscow, and transfer of all prisoners to Chelyabinsk. This included Erich Ber, Arnold Wilmer, Paul Heymann, and James Lewin (the surname is recorded as 'Levin' in the Soviet records).M. Mitsel \\"The Final Chapter\\": Agro-Joint in the Years of the Great Terror\\". Kiev: Dukh i Litera, 2012. According to records, the NKVD commenced proceedings against James Lewin in August and he was arrested on September 8, 1937. Following his transfer to Chelyabinsk, Lewin was found guilty on 31 December 1937, and was sentenced by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR to execution by gunshot, with confiscation of all his property. He was executed the same day.H. Steinberg, O. Somburg und G.R.B. Boocock \\"Der deutsch-j√ºdische Psychiater James Lewin - Ein zweifach vergessenes Opfer\\". Der Nervenarzt 2010 Lewin is probably buried in a mass grave located in the mines at Golden Mountain (Zlata Gora), where adits were used to hide the bodies of victims of NKVD operations. During his interrogation, Lewin allegedly confessed to \\"anti-Soviet counter revolutionary activities, spying for the Gestapo, and the planning of terrorist attacks\\".H. Steinberg, O. Somburg und G.R.B. Boocock \\"Der deutsch-j√ºdische Psychiater James Lewin - Ein zweifach vergessenes Opfer\\". Der Nervenarzt 2010 Such confessions were often extracted under torture are well-known to been factually unreliable. While some corroborated details of Lewin's life and family are accurate in the interrogation records, other details are characteristically implausible. For example, while Agro-Joint records indicate that Lewin was financially involved in exotic pet businesses during his time in Paris, the minutes of interrogation would have the reader believe that Lewin - a Jewish refugee - operated an ornamental fish store merely as cover for Gestapo meetings. According to the minutes, Lewin purportedly ran a production laboratory for chemical and bacteriological weapons in his Moscow apartment. Lewin, along with 28 other refugee doctors, was posthumously named in Germany's \\"List of Wanted Individuals in the USSR\\" (Sonderfahndungsliste UdSSR) prepared in 1941 by the Reich Main Security Office (RHSA). This publication is an equivalent to the infamous Black Book of wanted individuals drawn up for Great Britain.Sonderfahndungsliste UdSSR. Faksimile der 'Sonderfahndungsliste UdSSR' des Chefs der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD, das Fahndungsbuch der deutschen Einsatzgruppen im Russlandfeldzug, 1941 (Erlangen: Verlag D+C, 1977). On 22 June 2007 James Lewin was officially exonerated by the Russian Federation for lack of corpus delicti at his trial.H. Steinberg, O. Somburg und G.R.B. Boocock \\"Der deutsch-j√ºdische Psychiater James Lewin - Ein zweifach vergessenes Opfer\\". Der Nervenarzt 2010 Academic Work James Lewin was an active member of the Berlin Society for Psychiatry and Nervous Diseases, where he gave several lectures. He authored numerous psychiatric essays which are characterized by an epistemological approach. Following Alfred Erich Hoche syndrome theory, he called in his writings \\"to accept types of disease instead of disease units... one takes the symptoms of one engineered disease or another, without recognizing that a particular disease entity may not include them with certainty.\\" He called for a psychopathology that \\"describes the phenomenological psychological structure of morbid experiences without regard to clinical evaluation. \\"H. Steinberg, O. Somburg und G.R.B. Boocock \\"Der deutsch-j√ºdische Psychiater James Lewin - Ein zweifach vergessenes Opfer\\". Der Nervenarzt 2010 His publications include, among others, a monograph on Ludwig Klages' philosophy. At the time of his move to Russia, Agro-Joint records indicate that Lewin had works in progress on the subjects of Leibniz and Kant, philosophical anthropology, and \\"The Basics and Problems of Phenomology and Humanities Psychology\\". He remained active in his field during his short time in the USSR. On 10 October 1936, Lewin attended a meeting of the Moscow Society of Neuropathology and Psychiatry.

Taxonomy  Until recently, it was considered a subspecies of the Bornean bearded pig (Sus barbatus), but at least under the phylogenetic species concept, it must be classified as a separate species. For its treatment under other (and more widely used) species concepts, more study is required, but the presently available information seems to argue for full species status in any case.  Fossils Fossils excavated in Palawan were identified as being of the Palawan bearded pig, deer, Philippine long-tailed macaques, tiger, small mammals, lizards, snakes and turtles. From the stone tools, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, it would appear that early humans had accumulated the bones. Borneo might have been connected to Palawan during the penultimate and previous glacial periods, judging from the molecular phylogeny of murids. Remains of pigs were compared with the wild boar (Sus scrofa)and Palawanese wild boar (Sus ahoenobarbus).

It was entered into the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. It is based on the novel of the same name by Marguerite Yourcenar. The film received the Andr√© Cavens Award for Best Film by the Belgian Film Critics Association (UCC). Background In the 16th century, the Duke of Alba crushed the rebellion of Flanders against Spain. The strict Catholic King Philip II of Spain (1556-1598), restricted religious freedom and applied the decrees of the Council of Trent which strengthened the power of the Inquisition in Flanders. During this turbulent period, the venerable writer and philosopher Zenon Ligre arrived in Bruges. Plot The doctor and alchemist Zenon Ligre returns to his country of origin Flanders using false documentation, after spending his life traveling around Europe. In his hometown of Bruges, he finds work as a doctor in the convent of the Cordeliers. After founding a clinic and spa, he sets out to work as a doctor and alchemist for the poor. Zeno's ideology and methods were very popular among the Flemish population, but they ran the risk of being condemned by the Inquisition because they deviated from official orthodoxy. Having engaged in bisexual relations for several years, Zeno is accused of having homosexual relations with a young friar. Long sought after by authorities for his subversive writings, Zeno is arrested. He is tried by a court of the Inquisition and accused of witchcraft, murder, and unnatural relations. Rather than be burned at the stake, he prefers to choose his own death.

Sylvester Jr. (August 14, 1859 ‚Äì December 11, 1930) was the Chief of Police for Washington, District of Columbia from July 1898 to April 1915. He was an early president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP). Sylvester played an influential role in militarization of U.S. police departments in the early 20th century. Early years and education Sylvester was born in Iowa City, Iowa on August 14, 1859 to Richard H. Sylvester Sr.. He attended Washington University in St. Louis, where he majored in law, but he dropped out to become a journalist. He began working at papers in the Midwest. He was sent to Washington, D.C. as a newspaper correspondent. He worked as a disbursement officer with the Ute Indian Commission. Police career In 1898 Sylvester became Chief of Police for Washington, DC in 1898. =Militarization of police= During his tenure as Police Chief, Sylvester advocated for the use of the .38 caliber pistol by police (a weapon previously used by the military), referred to police officers as \\"citizen-soldiers\\", and advocated the use of similar interrogation techniques as used against Filipino insurgents by the U.S. military during the Philippine wars and occupation. Sylvester, who was police chief in Washington, D.C., which had a substantial nonwhite population, believed that racial minorities were morally degenerate and opposed racial intermingling. As police chief, his main targets were racial minorities. Sylvester divided police procedures into the arrest as the first degree, transportation to jail as the second degree and interrogation as the third degree. =Retirement= He retired as Chief of Police for Washington, DC on March 6, 1915 after charges were filed against him for his failure to protect suffragettes during their march in Washington on the day before the inauguration of Woodrow Wilson, and accusations of corruption laid against him by Congressman Frank Park. He was succeeded by Raymond W. Pullman. Private sector He established the du Pont protection division in 1914 to ensure the safety of the company's plants manufacturing materiel during World War I. While the war was still going on, Sylvester was serving as head of the du Pont police force in July 1918, when his investigation of an unexplained fire at a manufacturing plant led to his uncovering a plot to destroy buildings using fire extinguishers whose contents had been replaced with gasoline. Sylvester testified before the House Judiciary Committee in April 1928 in support of a \\"fence\\" bill drafted by Representative Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York that would make the transporting or concealing of stolen goods used in interstate commerce a crime punishable by a fine of $5,000 or up to two years in prison.Staff. \\"N. D.

He was an early advocate of great cooperation across international police forces, served on a committee established by the National Crime Commission on ways to improve rural policing and participated in the development of recommendations to have employees paid by check rather than cash as a way to reduce payroll robberies. Death He died on December 11, 1930 in Wilmington, Delaware where he had retired from DuPont just three weeks earlier. He was buried in Rock Creek Cemetery.

The album was Harley's first new album of new material since 1979's The Candidate. It featured a mixture of older songs first written and recorded in the 1980s and newer material. The album was produced by Harley and Matt Butler, except \\"Rain in Venice\\", which was produced Mickie Most, Harley and Butler, and \\"Irresistible\\", which was produced by Most and Harley. The album was mastered by Steve Rooke and Ian Jones at Abbey Road Studios in London. Background Throughout the 1980s, Harley released a handful of singles which either became minor hits or chart failures. In early 1984, he signed a record deal with Mickie Most's RAK Studios and began working at RAK Studios in London to record a new solo album. Some of the tracks recorded for the project included \\"Sophistication\\", \\"Irresistible\\", \\"Rain in Venice\\", \\"New-Fashioned Way\\", \\"The Lighthouse\\", \\"Star for a Week\\", \\"Promises Promises\\" and the 1970 Edwin Starr song \\"Oh How Happy\\". The song \\"Irresistible\\" was released as a single in 1985 and was remixed the following year to be issued as a single again. The 1986 version's sleeve announced the upcoming album El Gran Senor, however before it was released, RAK folded and was sold to EMI,http://rakpublishing.com/history leaving the album to be shelved. In 1989, Harley re-emerged with a UK and European tour with a new line-up of Cockney Rebel. Before the tour, Harley and ex-Cockney Rebel members Duncan Mackay and Jim Cregan entered Point Studios in London to write and record four new songs; \\"Dancing on the Telephone\\", \\"When I'm with You\\", \\"The Alibi\\" and \\"Limbs of Man\\". The first three songs were performed live on the 1989 tour, while \\"Dancing on the Telephone\\" and \\"The Alibi\\" would later appear on Yes You Can. During the same year, Harley announced that an album of new material would be recorded in the summer and released in the autumn that year. In 1990, with the album yet to be released, he revealed that work on the new album was almost done. However, he was unsure when it would be released as no label had been finalised. He listed the likely inclusions of the album as being: \\"The Lighthouse\\", \\"Star for a Week\\", \\"Promises\\", \\"Victim of Love\\", \\"Dancing on the Telephone\\" and \\"Not Alone Anymore\\" - the latter being a cover of the 1988 song by the supergroup Traveling Wilburys. Yes You Can surfaced in 1992 as a European-only release on the CTE label. The album featured a mix of older songs dating from the El Gran Senor period, as well as some newer tracks. Of the album's ten tracks, two were lifted from El Gran Senor; the 1986 extended remix of \\"Irresistible\\" and \\"Rain in Venice\\". The remaining songs were newer recordings, most of which were recorded at the White House Studios in Bures, Suffolk, while several were remixed at Metropolis Studios. \\"New-Fashioned Way\\" had originally been recorded for El Gran Senor as an up-tempo track, while \\"The Lighthouse\\" used different instrumentation including a saxophone solo (as opposed to the violin solo on Yes You Can). Although at one point Harley had decided to drop the rest of the El Gran Senor album, in 1991, he reworked \\"New-Fashioned Way\\" for his concerts. This led him to re-record the song for Yes You Can. Other 1980s recordings such as \\"Oh, How Happy\\" and \\"Sophistication\\" were left unreleased. \\"Star for a Week\\", one the oldest songs, had first been played live in 1979, while \\"Victim of Love\\" and \\"Fire in the Night\\" were two of the newer songs, written while on tour. In July 1992, Harley revealed to Record Collector: \\"I've just released a new album called Yes You Can in Europe, but it's not out in this country. I'm very proud of it. It sounds like a hundred and fifty grand album, and I've spent about a quarter of that on it. Because we were so well rehearsed we went in and played. I do use state of the art equipment. I've been 19 years in the business, as a professional, so I know a few tricks.\\" In effort to promote the 1992 European release of the album, Harley embarked on the \\"Yes You Can\\" tour. In March, he played various dates across Europe, followed by a set of UK dates in May.Steve Harley ‚Äì Yes You Can Tour 1992 ‚Äì Tour Programme ‚Äì Spot on Print Organisation In Europe, \\"Irresistible\\" was released for the third and final time as a single. =UK release= Speaking to Record Collector in 1992, Harley was asked about the possibility of EMI releasing the album in the UK. Harley said: During 1993, Yes You Can was released in the UK by Food for Thought Records. To tie in with the UK release of the album, \\"Star for a Week (Dino)\\" was released as a promotional single. The album did not make an appearance in the UK Albums Chart. Harley had expressed wishes for the label to release \\"Victim of Love\\" as a single. Recording All tracks were recorded at the White House Studios in Bures, Suffolk, except \\"Irresistible\\" (recorded at RAK Studios) and \\"Rain in Venice\\" (recorded at RAK Studios and Metropolis Studios). \\"Rain in Venice\\", \\"New- Fashioned Way\\", \\"The Lighthouse\\", \\"The Alibi\\" and \\"Promises\\" were remixed at Metropolis Studios, while \\"Victim of Love\\" and \\"Star for a Week (Dino)\\", \\"Fire in the Night\\", \\"Dancing on the Telephone\\" were remixed at White House Studios. \\"Irresistible\\" was remixed at Air Studios.https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015510/http://www.harleyfanzone.com/Discs/Yescan_1.html Rod Stewart provided some backing vocals during recording sessions for Yes You Can, but his contributions were not used. Release The album was first released within Europe in 1992 on CD via CTE. It was marketed and distributed by Cte GmbH, Licensee, and manufactured in Switzerland. In 1993, it was released via Food For Thought Records on CD and cassette in the UK with a re- arranged track listing. In 1995, it was re-issued via Koch International and within the UK on 22 April 2002, it would be re-issued by Comeuppance, which was based on the European version. On 6 October 2003, Voiceprint issued the album limitedly as a part of their \\"2 for One Series\\" along with Harley's 1979 studio album The Candidate. The album's European cover featured a hand-drawn portrait of Harley. The 1993 UK release featured a futuristic blue cover instead of the original European artwork. Critical reception Upon release, Peter Kinghorn of Newcastle Evening Chronicle commented: \\"Although there's nothing with the impact of Cockney Rebel days, Harley can still put over a lyric and the compositions bear the hallmark of quality.\\"Newcastle Evening Chronicle - Record reviews - Peter Kinghorn - 3 May 1993 - page 7 Neil McKay of Sunday Life commented: \\"Harley's first album for more than a decade is solid rather than spectacular. Everything is just where it should be, in a modern AOR-ish sort of way, and it cries out for the inspired weirdness that made some of his Cockney Rebel material so good.\\" Andrew Boyd of the Reading Evening Post felt Yes You Can was a \\"damp squib of an album\\" and a \\"dreary, clich√©d collection, unlikely to push Harley far into the charts\\". Dave Thompson of AllMusic retrospectively reviewed the album, writing: \\"It's a sad state of affairs, but the best of Yes You Can was never going to make it onto a studio recording. Rather, it resides in the live environment where the songs almost unanimously came to life. In the studio, the emotion pales, and Harley's energies flag accordingly. Yes You Can is not the revival for which fans had been hoping for. But excuse the inadequacies and overlook the lifelessness, and the core of the songs remains sound and proud.\\" Track listingPersonnel *Steve Harley ‚Äì vocals (all tracks), 12-string acoustic guitar (track 9), harmonica (tracks 2, 9), producer (all tracks) *Harvey Hinsley ‚Äì guitar (track 1) *Jim Cregan ‚Äì acoustic guitar (track 3) *Robin Le Mesurier ‚Äì electric guitar (track 3) *Alan Darby ‚Äì guitar (tracks 4‚Äì5, 7, 10) *Rick Driscoll ‚Äì rhythm guitar (track 5), guitar (track 9) *Robbie Gladwell ‚Äì guitar (tracks 6, 8) *Nick Pynn ‚Äì violin (tracks 4, 7), rhythm guitar (track 8), acoustic guitar (track 10) *Barry Wickens ‚Äì acoustic guitar (track 2), violin (tracks 2, 5, 9) *Adrian Lee ‚Äì keyboards (track 1) *Duncan Mackay ‚Äì keyboards (track 3) *Ian Nice - keyboards (tracks 2, 4-10) *Kevin Powell ‚Äì bass (tracks 2, 5, 9) *Billy Dyer - bass (tracks 4, 7‚Äì8, 10) *Mark Brzezicki - drums (track 1) *Stuart Elliott ‚Äì drums (tracks 2, 5, 9) *Dave Mattacks ‚Äì drums (track 3) *Paul Francis ‚Äì drums (tracks 4, 6‚Äì7, 10), hand- snare (track 8) *Mickie Most ‚Äì producer (tracks 1, 3) *Matt Butler ‚Äì producer (tracks 2-10), engineer (tracks 2-10) *Mike Nocito ‚Äì engineer (tracks 1, 3) *Simon Smart ‚Äì engineer (tracks 2, 5, 9) *Stuart Breed - remixing (track 1) *Ian Jones ‚Äì mastering *Steve Rooke ‚Äì mastering *Kevin Williamson ‚Äì illustrations References Steve Harley albums 1992 albums albums produced by Mickie Most ","title":"Yes You Can (album)"},{"id":"23764152","text":"Isabelle de Craon, Dame de Foug√®res (born 1212), was a French noblewoman, being the daughter of Amaury I, Sire de Craon, a wealthy baron who was the possessor of many lordships in Anjou and Maine.

She had an elder sister, Jeanne who was bethrothed to the three-year-old Arthur of Brittany in 1223. Arthur died that same year, and nothing further is known about Jeanne. Isabelle's paternal grandparents were Maurice II de Craon and Isabelle de Meulan. Her maternal grandparents were Guillaume des Roches, Seneschal of Anjou and Marguerite de Sabl√©. Being the husband of Jeanne, eldest daughter of Guillaume des Roches, the hereditary seneschalship of Anjou and the vast Sabl√© barony passed to Isabelle's father upon the death of her maternal grandfather on 15 July 1222. Amaury died in 1226, when Isabelle was fourteen years old. Marriage and issue On an unknown date sometime before 1230, Isabelle married Raoul III, Sire de Foug√®res, the son of Geoffrey, Seigneur de Foug√®res and Mathilde de Porhoet. The marriage was documented in a charter dated February 1233. The chateau of Foug√®res in Brittany became their principal residence. Together Raoul and Isabelle had: * Jean de Fougeres (born and died 6 December 1230) * Jeanne de Foug√®res, suo jure Dame de Foug√®res (died after 1273), on 29 January 1254 married Hugh XII of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, Count of Angoul√™me, by whom she had six children. Isabelle died on an unknown date. Her husband Raoul died on 24 February 1256, and his seigneury of Foug√®res was inherited by their only surviving child, Jeanne who thereafter held the title of suo jure Dame de Foug√®res.

Organizational background  In the past decade and a half, three major developments have reshaped the landscape for K-12 history education and have created the conditions for significant advances in history teaching and learning. First, the emergence of the Internet and the World Wide Web has brought unprecedented resources and possibilities to the computers of the nation's history teachers. Second, a body of serious scholarly research in history education ‚Äì and the learning sciences more generally ‚Äì has begun to illuminate how students actually learn history. Finally, the Department of Education's Teaching American History (TAH) program has invested more than $900 million in history education ‚Äì the largest federal infusion of resources ever devoted to improving the teaching and learning of history. It was the favorite proposal of U.S. Senator Robert Byrd, and its grants are called \\"Byrd grants.\\"Melendez, Margarita L. Teaching American History Article. The Society for History in the Federal Government newsletter, The Federalist, Fall 2008, Number 19, accessed May 31, 2011. Due to these advancements, the United States Department of Education announced a call for proposals in 2007 to address the building, populating, and maintaining of a central website for K-12 American history educators, funded under the Teaching American History Grant program (TAH). George Mason University's Center for History and New Media was awarded the grant for the website creation the same year.\\"George Mason University Receives $7.5 Million to Create a National History Education Clearinghouse\\" , History News Network, October 3, 2007, accessed May 31, 2011.Gardner, Walt. \\"Ignorance of History Permeates All Levels\\", Education Week, June 22, 2011, accessed August 15, 2011 The TAH program is funded under Title II-C, Subpart 4 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. According to the TAH program website, the goal of the program is to \\"raise student achievement by improving teachers‚Äô knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of American history.United States Department of Education, Teaching American History, accessed May 31, 2011.\\"  Organizational goals  One goal is to bring together K-12 American history resources to help educators find and use them. Another goal is to create materials that detail strategies for teaching and learning history to help educators improve classroom teaching. A third goal is to disseminate lessons learned by more than 900 Teaching American History (TAH) grants designed to raise student achievement by improving teachers' knowledge and understanding of traditional U.S. history. Teachinghistory.org is updated regularly and is organized around six sections: History Content, Best Practices, Teaching Materials, Issues and Research, Teaching American History (TAH) Projects, and Digital Classroom. In addition, the website offers a weekly history quiz, a blog, and features that allow users to submit history content, history teaching, and digital history questions to experts in the field.  Partners  With funding from the U.S. Department of Education under the Office of Innovation and Improvement, Teachinghistory.org, also known as the National History Education Clearinghouse, was developed through a collaboration between the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (CHNM) at George Mason University and the Stanford History Education Group at Stanford University. CHNM and the Stanford History Education Group have worked on other projects together, including Historical Thinking Matters, a website focused on key topics in U.S. history that is designed to teach students how to critically read primary sources and how to critique and construct historical narratives.Historical Thinking Matters, accessed May 31, 2011.

It has development offices in San Ramon, California; Sheffield, England; and Belfast, Northern Ireland. WANdisco is a corporate contributor to Hadoop, Subversion and other open source projects. History The name WANdisco is an acronym for wide area network distributed computing. Initially offering a replication solution for distributed teams using the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), this was expanded to include Apache Subversion with SVN MultiSite Plus in 2006, Git with Git MultiSite in 2013 and Gerrit with Gerrit MultiSite in 2014. In 2012, WANdisco acquired AltoStor, and entered the Big Data market with its Non-Stop Hadoop product. AltoStor's founders, Dr. Konstantin Shvachko and Jagane Sundar, joined WANdisco as part of the acquisition, and helped develop the company's next generation Hadoop product released in 2015, WANdisco Fusion. Technology WANdisco's Distributed Coordination Engine (DConE) is the shared component for WANdisco clustering products. The DConE system allows multiple instances of the same application to operate on independent hardware without sharing any resources. All of the application servers are kept in synchronisation by DConE regardless of whether the servers are on the same LAN or globally separated and accessible only over a wide area network (WAN). WANdisco's replication technology was the work of Yeturu Aahlad, who had previously worked for Sun, Netscape and IBM, and was involved in developing the CORBA Framework. Aahlad theorized a model for effective Active replication over a WAN. In the development of DConE, WANdisco has taken the Paxos algorithm as a baseline and added innovations relevant to mission-critical, high transaction volume distributed environments. WANdisco provides replication products for CVS, Apache Subversion, Git, Gerrit, Apache Hadoop, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform. In addition, the company offers support, consultancy and training services. The company's website lists companies such as ARM, Avaya, Bally Technologies, Barclays, BlackRock, Bosch, Cisco, Dell EMC, Disney, Fujitsu, General Electric, Honda, Juniper Networks and Pitney Bowes. =IBM OEM= In April 2016, WANdisco announced that IBM had signed a deal to OEM WANdisco Fusion. The deal allows IBM to rebrand Fusion as \\"IBM Big Replicate\\" and plays an important role in the IBM Big Data and Cloud Computing strategy, including movement of data between on-premises software and Cloud. =Blockchain= In July 2018, WANdisco announced that it had filed a new patent in Blockchain. The company claims that the patent \\"enables effective permissioned blockchain transactions with an underlying algorithmic mechanism. This mechanism enables throughput to be achieved that is orders of magnitude higher than public blockchains.\\" =Defunct products= In 2011 WANdisco announced uberSVN, a deployment of Apache Subversion which included a web based management console and the ability to add additional application lifecycle management features. The uberSVN download was available through mid-2013. Open source contributions In September 2013 WANdisco announced it is an official sponsor of the UC Berkeley AMPLab, a five-year collaborative effort at the University of California, Berkeley. =Hadoop= WANdisco has one Apache Hadoop committer on staff: Jagane Sundar. In February 2013 WANdisco released a free distribution of Hadoop containing additional components developed by WANdisco. =Subversion= WANdisco was involved in the Apache Subversion open source project from 2008 through 2015. They employed several contributors to work on the Subversion project during that time. Server and client binaries WANdisco provides Subversion binary downloads for Windows, CentOS, Debian, Oracle Linux, RHEL, SUSE Linux, Ubuntu, Mac OS X and Solaris via its website. These binaries use the default package management system for each Linux distribution. Project announcements In December 2010, WANdisco announced its intention to develop some features for the Subversion project, specifically aimed at improving branching and merging functionality. The Apache Foundation and some Subversion developers said the announcement contained unfounded claims and insinuations about community involvement and the lack of development on these features. According to Apache, these features were already being worked on at the time. David Richards from WANdisco clarified this position to the Subversion community and followed up by announcing WANdisco's sponsorship and ongoing support for the work of the Apache Software Foundation.

It was produced by Harley. Background Since 1989, Harley made a return to regular touring with Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel, and also released the solo album Yes You Can in 1992. In the mid-1990s, Harley began recording his fourth solo album at Berry House Studios in Ardingly, Sussex. Working with an array of musicians, including Nick Pynn and Phil Beer, Poetic Justice was released on Transatlantic Records in August 1996. The album featured seven new songs, three covers, and a re-recording of \\"Riding the Waves (For Virginia Woolf)\\", which was recorded live in the studio and had originally appeared on Harley's 1978 debut solo album Hobo with a Grin. Most of the album's new material had been written by Harley while on tour. The album's three covers consisted of the Jimmy Ruffin's \\"What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted?\\", Bob Dylan's \\"Love Minus Zero-No Limit\\" and Van Morrison's \\"Crazy Love\\". Speaking to Smiler magazine in May 1997, Harley commented of the covers: \\"There's a lot of people who are quite unhappy with the covers that I've done on my new album, so I'm thinking I won't bother doing any again. My audience think I've run out of ideas if I only write eight out of eleven.\\" No singles were released to promote the album, despite Harley's interest in releasing \\"That's My Life in Your Hands\\" and \\"The Last Time I Saw You\\", while \\"What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted?\\" had also been recorded as a potential single. In his interview with Smiler, Harley commented: Speaking of Robson & Jerome reaching the UK number one spot with their own 1996 version of \\"What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted?\\", Harley added: \\"I'd recorded it long before they turned up. We were saying to the record company, I'd done this as a single, and they hadn't got a bloody clue. Three months later it was being played by them.\\" Later in 2002, Harley spoke of Poetic Justice in an interview with Perfect Sound Forever. He said: Song information \\"That's My Life in Your Hands\\" was written by Harley and Hugh Nicholson. Harley recalled in 2015: \\"Hugh had written another song, same chords, different words and title. I asked permission to change the lyrics and produce my own version. I wrote all the lyrics.\\" The original song, \\"Starlight Jingles\\", was first recorded by Nicholson's band Blue, during their sessions at Los Angeles between 1979-82, and later by Radio Heart for their self-titled 1987 album. A live version of \\"That's My Life in Your Hands\\" would later appear as one of two bonus tracks on the 2000 CD release of Harley's Hobo with a Grin album. On 29 April 1994, \\"The Last Time I Saw You\\" received its debut live performance at the Mick Ronson Memorial Concert, which was held at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. This live version, along with Harley's performance of \\"Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)\\" at the same concert, would appear on the 2001 two-disc CD compilation The Mick Ronson Memorial Concert. On Harley's 2001 single \\"A Friend for Life\\", a live version of \\"Safe\\" was added as one of two bonus tracks. It had been recorded live at The Blomsbury Theatre in London during the spring of 2000. \\"Two Damn'd Lies\\", \\"All in a Life's Work\\" and \\"The Last Time I Saw You\\" would all later appear on the 2003 live album Acoustic and Pure Live, which featured ex-Cockney Rebel guitarist Jim Cregan. Release The album was released on CD by the independent label Transatlantic Records in the UK. The label was a division of Castle Communications Plc. On 7 October 2002, Castle Music Ltd. re-issued the album on CD. Later, on 20 September 2010, Repertoire Records, under license from Comeuppance Ltd., re-issued the album as a digi-pack CD. For this re-issue, the album's back cover was re-worked, featuring a dark shot of a hill and the sky, instead of the original cover of a distant woodland in the dark. In 2010‚Äì11, Sanctuary Fontana made the album available as a digital download on sites such as iTunes. Critical reception Upon release, High Fidelity News and Record Review reviewed the album and commented: \\"Something about Harley has him classified, historically, with rock's assholes, but this latest solo almost redeems him. His first in five years contains a cluster of originals and three seemingly out-of-place covers which actually work in the context of his own songs.\\" Thom Jurek of AllMusic retrospectively said: Additionally, out of the eleven songs on the album, Jurek highlighted \\"What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted?\\", \\"Two Damn'd Lies\\" and Crazy Love\\" as album highlights by labelling them AMG Pick Tracks. Writing in the liner notes of the 2001 BGO Records re-issue of The Best Years of Our Lives, Alan Clayson spoke of Poetic Justice, claiming it \\"an album that was equal of 1975's better-known The Best Years of Our Lives.\\" In the 2007 Italian book 24.000 Dischi (24,000 Discs), Riccardo Bertoncelli and Cris Thellung stated: \\"Harley confirms a vein intimate, melancholic, introverted but of great emotional and poetic lyricism. It is another disc gone unnoticed but beautiful and deeply felt, which stand out the cover of \\"Live Minus Zero\\" (Dylan) and \\"Crazy Love\\" (Van Morrison) and stunning reinterpretation of \\"Last Time I Saw You\\" and \\"Riding the Waves\\" (dedicated to Virginia Woolf).\\" Track listingPersonnel * Steve Harley ‚Äì vocals, producer * Nick Pynn ‚Äì acoustic guitar, 12-string guitar, dulcimer, mando-cello * Phil Beer ‚Äì electric guitar, acoustic guitar, bottle-neck guitar, violin, vocals * Richard Durrant ‚Äì classical guitar (track 10) * Thomas Arnold ‚Äì Hammond organ, piano, honky-tonk, percussion * Ian Nice ‚Äì piano, keyboards * Andrew Brown ‚Äì bass, double-bass * Herbie Flowers ‚Äì double- bass (track 5) * Paul Francis ‚Äì drums * Mark Price ‚Äì drums (tracks 5, 9) * Susan Harvey ‚Äì vocals * Curtis Schwartz ‚Äì engineer * Phil Nicholls ‚Äì sleeve photography * Chris Insoll ‚Äì photo tinting * Hugh Gilmour at Castle ‚Äì design * Steve Blackwell - representation * James Wyllie ‚Äì representation * Paul Charles at Asgard ‚Äì agency References Steve Harley albums 1996 albums ","title":"Poetic Justice (Steve Harley album)"},{"id":"23764610","text":"Tallahassee is an unincorporated community in Jeff Davis County, Georgia, United States.

Reports from the Holocaust contains a diverse selection of Kramer's nonfiction writings focused on AIDS activism and LGBT civil rights, including letters to the editor and speeches, which document his time spent at Gay Men's Health Crisis, ACT UP, and beyond. Overview The central message of the book is that gay men must accept responsibility for their lives, and that those who are still living must give back to their community by fighting for People With AIDS (PWA‚Äôs) and LGBT rights, for, as Kramer states, \\"I must put back something into this world for my own life, which is worth a tremendous amount. By not putting back, you are saying that your lives are worth shit, and that we deserve to die, and that the deaths of all our friends and lovers have amounted to nothing. I can't believe that in your heart of hearts you feel this way. I can't believe you want to die. Do you?\\"Kramer, Larry, Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist. St. Martin's Press 1994. , p. 175 The first publication provides a portrait of Kramer as activist, and the 1994 edition contains commentary written by him that reflects on his earlier pieces and provides insight into Larry Kramer as writer. Thoughts on the LGBT Response to AIDS Activism Kramer raises the question of whether modern LGBT organizations are complicit in the oppression of their own members and the Holocaust that is AIDS, by cooperating with heterosexual society and passively collaborating in the genocide against gay men that Kramer recognizes AIDS to be, making them into gay \\"Uncle Toms\\" that value their own personal finances and prestige at the expense of the LGBT individuals and PWA‚Äôs they claim to represent.Kramer, Larry, Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist. St. Martin's Press 1994. , p. 229 Toward the goal of preventing this occurrence, the collection contains information for individuals that are committed to social justice but currently corralled in nonprofit LGBT organizations that refuse to adopt a political stance. Kramer also addresses claims made by leaders of some LGBT organizations that they are unable to act politically, even when faced with a health crisis that he believes must be defined as a plague, because their 501(c)(3) tax status, a classification which permits them to receive tax deductible donations, would be lost. Kramer contends that, from a practical perspective, if the Catholic Church, the Salvation Army, the American Cancer Society, and Sloan-Kettering can pursue political activism while preserving their nonprofit status, so too can organizations who fight for LGBT rights and People With AIDS.Kramer, Larry, Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist. St. Martin's Press 1994. , p. 108 He further responds that such organizations cannot hide behind this bureaucratic cover, for these groups may easily reorganize to include a 501(c)(4) division that is not tax exempt, while allowing the tax deductible status of the remaining branches of the organization to continue.Kramer, Larry, Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist. St. Martin's Press 1994. , p. 120 Exploration of Individual Empowerment In some sections of the book, Kramer focuses on the concept of individual empowerment, and how those who feel powerless may gain influence by taking responsibility, even for what would appear to be insignificant, mundane tasks. As Kramer states in a 1987 speech contained in the volume: > Power is little pieces of paper on the floor. No one picks them up. Ten > people walk by and no one picks up the piece of paper on the floor. The > eleventh person walks by and is tired of looking at it, and so he bends down > and picks it up. The next day he does the same thing. And soon he's in > charge of picking up the paper. And he's got a lot of pieces of paper that > he's picked up. Now- think of those pieces of paper as standing for > responsibility. This man or woman who is picking up the pieces of paper is, > by being responsible, acquiring more and more power. He doesn't necessarily > want it, but he's tired of seeing the floor littered. All power is the > willingness to accept responsibility.Kramer, Larry, Reports from the > Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist. St. Martin's Press 1994. , pp. > 135-136 These ideas are further reinforced in a speech given several years later, in which Kramer states, \\"Your voice is your power. Your collective voices. Your group power. Names all strung together on membership lists are power. Bodies all strung together in a line are power.\\"Kramer, Larry, Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist. St. Martin's Press 1994. , p. 350 Use of the Term Holocaust and Criticism of the Response to AIDS Kramer directly and deliberately defines AIDS as a Holocaust because he believes the United States' government failed to respond quickly and expend the necessary resources to cure AIDS, largely because AIDS initially infected gay men, and, quite soon after, predominantly poor and politically powerless minorities. Through speeches, editorials, and personal, sometimes publicized, letters to figures such as politician Gary Bauer, former New York Mayor Ed Koch, several New York Times reporters, and head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, Kramer personally advocates for a more significant response to AIDS. He implores the government to conduct research based on commonly accepted scientific standards and to allocate funds and personnel to AIDS research. Kramer ultimately states that the response to AIDS in America must be defined as a Holocaust because of the large number deaths that resulted from the negligence and apathy that surrounded AIDS in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and early Bill Clinton Presidencies. Kramer also describes his frustration with many members of the gay community that do not actively advocate for PWAs and AIDS research, stating that they are complicit in their own deaths.Kramer, Larry, Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist. St. Martin's Press 1994. Self Reflection and Insights in the 1994 Edition In 1994, Kramer's book was expanded to include some of his more recent pieces, as well as Kramer's own commentary on the original selections. In this commentary, Kramer provides his thoughts on some of his audiences, his speaking style, and his approach to writing and revision. For example, he informs the reader that during one speech, \\"I delivered this list while staring Cardinal O'Connor right in the eye,\\"Kramer, Larry, Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist. St. Martin's Press 1994. , p. 185 and reveals at another point that, \\"the audience for this symposium appeared to be composed mostly of elderly men and women, with nothing else to do, who filled their days attending activities like this one, costing nothing. The first time the word 'gay' was mentioned, a number of them got up and walked out. While I spoke, I saw only stony faces and icy stares.\\"Kramer, Larry, Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist. St. Martin's Press 1994. , p. 181 He also offers a glimpse into his approach to writing and revision. For example, at one point Kramer questions his use of anaphora in the repetition of the phrase, ‚ÄúOh, My People‚Äù in one of his speeches by writing in the commentary, ‚ÄúI guess it looks corny in print, but it sounded good in the Waldorf [where the speech was delivered]. If it does seem too much (Wise Friends had recommended ‚ÄòOh, My Friends‚Äô)- well, it won‚Äôt be the first time I‚Äôve erred in that direction. Anyway, I like it.‚ÄùKramer, Larry, Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist.

Belonging to the wing of that ideology that favoured links between Germany and an independent Austria, he lost influence as the drive for Anschluss grew within both Austrian National Socialism and German Nazism. Early years A native of Wiener Neustadt,Riehl, Walter Riehl joined the army as a one-year volunteer in 1900.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 322 Following his military service he enrolled in the Faculty of Law at Vienna University and, after also studying at several institutions in Germany, he graduated in 1908 with his doctorate in law. Whilst studying he was briefly active in the Social Democratic Party of Austria, where his main contribution was an attempt to influence fellow members towards the temperance movement. A devout member of the Catholic Church, he became appalled at the tendency towards Marxism that was gaining importance in the party at the time, and ultimately left before 1907 citing the dominance of Jewish members within the party. From then on anti-Semitism was to be central to Riehl's personal political creed. DNSAP Moving to the right, Riehl was initially a disciple of conservative philosopher Othmar Spann.Eric Voegelin, The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, 1999, p. 15 Despite this he joined the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP) in 1908.R.J.B. Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 441 As a DAP member representing the middle classes he advocated a name change and a broadening of membership away from simply the working classes.John T. Lauridsen, Nazism and the radical right in Austria, 1918-1934, 2007, p. 280 Influenced by the radical racialist theories of Georg Ritter von Sch√∂nerer, Riehl took a leading role in organising the party's youth movement. Considered part of the DAP's radical wing, he argued that dictatorship was the only option in overcoming class conflict whilst also becoming noted for his expression of anti-Czech sentiments. His involvement with the party saw him lose the position he had held within the Austrian civil service and he spent time working in a lawyer's office in Germany around 1911. Following the outbreak of the First World War he enlisted in the Landsturm before in late 1915 being recalled to the regular army, where he saw action on the Italian Front.Rees, Biographical Dictionary, p. 323 He became deputy chairman of the DAP in March 1918 and two months leader took over as leader. The party was renamed Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei (DNSAP) immediately after the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.John T. Lauridsen, Nazism and the radical right in Austria, 1918-1934, 2007, p. 283 As leader Riehl moved the DNSAP, which had mainly been an anti-Czech party towards anti- Semitism. He sought to blame Austria's problems on the Jews and wanted them expelled from the country.Bruce F. Pauley, From Prejudice to Persecution, 1998, pp. 192-3 He also supported profit sharing and land reformS.J. Woolf, Fascism in Europe, 1981, p. 97 and also sought to build up the party in universities, setting up a German Academic Association of National Socialists as early as June 1919.John T. Lauridsen, Nazism and the radical right in Austria, 1918-1934, 2007, p. 292 Where the DAP had been avowedly a \\"class\\" party, Riehl sought to distance the group from any such consideration, instead tying it in to the wider V√∂lkisch movement. Riehl was aware from early on of the existence of the German Workers' Party in Germany itself and maintained correspondence with its early leader Anton Drexler. He was not a supporter of union with Germany but nonetheless he accepted a subservient role to Adolf Hitler at an early stage, referring to him \\"unseren reichsdeutschen f√ºhrer\\" (our German Reich leader) in 1922.John T. Lauridsen, Nazism and the radical right in Austria, 1918-1934, 2007, p. 301 Certainly contact was established between the two very early and Carsten has suggested that Hitler added the epithet 'National Socialist' to his German Workers Party in imitation of Riehl's movement.F.L. Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, London: Methuen & Co, 1974, p. 95 Riehl remained as leader of the DNSAP until 1923 when it split between the pro-Hitler and pro-independence factions. Initially placed on a leave of absence, supposedly for health reasons, Riehl was eventually expelled from the party as the Hitlerite wing gained the upper hand. Riehl took charge of the pro-independence Deutschsozialen Verein wing of the party with Karl Schulz leading the Hitlerite group.Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, p. 129 Riehl's party worked closely with the Greater German People's Party and in the 1927 election they presented a joint list under the name Nationale Einheitsfront. He also played a role in Hermann Hiltl's Frontk√§mpfervereinigung, a Pan-German militia group that was independent of the Nazis. Return to favour Riehl's profile fell somewhat after the split as the pro-Germany wing won the lion's share of support. However Riehl would come back into favour in 1925 when he defended Otto Rothstock at his trial for the murder of Hugo Bettauer.Bruce F. Pauley, From Prejudice to Persecution, 1998, p. 105 His involvement in the trial helped him to regain prestige in the DNSAP after resigning from the leadership following the schisms of 1923.Bruce F. Pauley, From Prejudice to Persecution, 1998, p. 194 Riehl gained notoriety for his defences of right-wing leaders in a number of cases and in the aftermath of the Schattendorf Incident it was he who secured the acquittal of the accused rightist leaders.G√ºnter Bischof, Anton Pelinka, Rolf Steininger, Austria in the Nineteen Fifties, 1995, p. 148 Riehl returned to the Nazis on 26 September 1930, being admitted as member number 360.702. He returned to a prominent position within the party and used this influence to again promote his anti-Semitic agenda. In 1931 he called for castration for any Jewish man caught having sex with an Aryan girl and when elected to Vienna council the following year he made a further call for expulsion of the Jews from the area.Bruce F. Pauley, From Prejudice to Persecution, 1998, pp. 200-1 Indeed, for Riehl anti-Semitism was the entire basis of the Nazis' appeal in Austria, along with their anti-communism.Bruce F. Pauley, From Prejudice to Persecution, 1998, p. 202 Later years Despite his extreme views on the Jews, Riehl was more committed to constitutional methods than some of his DNSAP colleagues and he became a critic of some of the group's excesses, such that he was expelled again on 9 August 1933. He was especially critical of the leadership of Theodor Habicht and Alfred Frauenfeld, in particular the botched Coup d'√©tat of 1934 which resulted in the murder of Engelbert Dollfuss.F. Parkinson, Conquering the Past, 1989, p. 44 Advocating a more Christianity- based form of nationalism, he established the Weiner Stadtklub as an ideological discussion group in 1937, although this proved to be largely Nazi in character. Briefly held in detention by the Gestapo after the Anschluss, he then attempted to join the NSDAP but was rejected on account of his shaky record on supporting union with Germany.Profile in German He was eventually allowed to join the Nazi Party although he was never more than a rank-and-file member. He disappeared from the public eye after this although after the Second World War he held membership of the Austrian People's Party. Riehl died in Vienna.

The high-performance computing cluster is operated by Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP), the university's central information technology organization. ITaP also operates clusters named Steele built in 2008, Rossmann built in 2010, and Hansen and Carter built in 2011. Coates was the largest campus supercomputer in the Big Ten outside a national center when built. It was the first native 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GigE) cluster to be ranked in the TOP500 and placed 102nd on the June 2010 list. Hardware The Coates cluster consists of 982 64-bit, 8-core HP Proliant DL165 G5p and 11 64-bit, 16-core HP Proliant DL585 G5 systems using AMD 2380 and AMD 8380 processors with various combinations of 16-128 gigabytes of RAM, 500 GB to 2 terabytes of disk and 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GigE) local to each node. Coates uses Cisco and Chelsio network equipment. The cluster's nodes are arrayed in five logical sub- clusters each with different memory and storage configurations designed to meet the varying needs of the researchers using Coates. Software Coates nodes run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 (RHEL5.6) and use Portable Batch System Professional 10.4.6 (PBSPro 10.4.6) for resource and job management. The cluster also has compilers and scientific programming libraries installed. Cooling system Coates has a heat-exchanging cooling system that recycles the hot water for use on the Purdue campus. Construction Coates was largely built in less than four hours on July 21, 2009, by a team of more than 200 Purdue computer technicians and volunteers, including volunteers from Indiana University, the University of Iowa, the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. It was the second such \\"high-tech barn raising\\" hosted by Purdue to assemble a cluster in a single morning. The process was first used for the Steele cluster in 2008. Funding The Coates supercomputer and Purdue's other clusters are part of the Purdue Community Cluster Program, a partnership between ITaP and Purdue faculty. In Purdue's program, a \\"community\\" cluster is funded by hardware money from grants, faculty startup packages, institutional funds and other sources. ITaP's Rosen Center for Advanced Computing administers the community clusters and provides user support. Each faculty partner always has ready access to the capacity he or she purchases and potentially to more computing power when the nodes of other investors are idle. Users The Purdue departments and schools by which Coates is used vary broadly, including Aeronautics and Astronautics, Agronomy, Biology, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Communications, Computer Science, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Physics, the Purdue Terrestrial Observatory and Statistics. DiaGrid Unused, or opportunistic, cycles from Coates are made available to the TeraGrid and the Open Science Grid using Condor software. Coates is part of Purdue's distributed computing Condor flock, which is the largest publicly disclosed distributed computing system in the world and the center of DiaGrid, a nearly 43,000-processor Condor-powered distributed computing network for research involving Purdue and partners at nine other campuses. Naming The Coates cluster is named for Clarence L. \\"Ben\\" Coates, who came to Purdue in 1973 to head the School of Electrical Engineering (now Electrical and Computer Engineering) where, for the next decade, he emphasized computer education and the development of computing facilities. He was a driving force behind the high-performance computing and networking plan that led to the creation of the Engineering Computer Network (ECN) serving all of Purdue‚Äôs engineering schools. He also initiated a degree program in computer engineering at Purdue. As a research scientist at the General Electric Research Laboratory in New York, Coates developed five patents involving waveform recognition devices, circuit gates and accumulators on computer chips.

Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma's troops surrounded the city of Neuss, an important Protestant garrison in the Electorate of Cologne. After the city refused to capitulate, Parma's army reduced the city to rubble through a combination of artillery fire, destructive house-to-house fighting, and plundering; during the battle, a fire started that destroyed most of the rest of the city. Approximately 3000 civilians died, out of a population of around 4500, and the entire garrison was killed. Situation in 1586 Neuss had been seized by supporters of the Protestant Prince-Elector Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg in February 1586. Adolf, Count of Moers and Neuenahr, reinforced and supplied the city and took most of his troops north, to Moers and Venlo, leaving the young Friedrich Cloedt in command of the city. Cloedt had a garrison of 1600 men, mostly Germans and Dutch soldiers; some had military experience, but many were recent recruits.Leonard Ennen, Geschichte der Stadt K√∂ln, v. 5, specifically p. 178. 1880. One hundred years earlier it had resisted a lengthy siege by Charles the Bold of Burgundy, and for its efforts, the emperor had granted Neuss the right to mint its own coins and to incorporate the imperial arms in its own coat of arms. In June, the Duke of Parma approached the city and surrounded its landed fortifications; he was supported by Karl von Mansfeld, Francisco Verdugo, and Salentin VII of Isenburg-Grenzau. J. H. Hennes, Der Kampf um das Erzstift K√∂ln, Cologne, 1878, p. 178. Engraved map of the city of Neuss Parma had an impressive force at his command; in addition to Mansfeld's 2000 troops, he had another 6000 or so foot and Tercios, plus 2000 mounted, experienced Italian, Spanish, and some German soldiers, plus some 45 cannons, which Parma distributed on the redoubt across the river, and on the heights some short distance from the city walls.Charles Maurice Davies The history of Holland and the Dutch nation, vol. 3, 1851, p. 188, reported Parma had as many as 18,000 troops; most sources settle the number at closer to 10,000: See Hennes, Der Kampf um das Erzstift Koln,,Ennen, Geschichte der Stadt K√∂ln and J. Hansen, Nuntiaturberichte aus Deutschland: Der Kampf um K√∂ln, Berlin, 1892. Prior to the cannonade, Parma requested the capitulation of the city, which was declined, officially with great politeness, but as Parma's emissary returned to the Spanish camp, he was followed by jeers and insults from the townsmen. The next day, being the feast of St. James, and the patron day for the Spanish, the battle was not joined, however, reports circulated in the Spanish camp that two soldiers, captured in the previous days' sorties, had been roasted alive in the market square to desecrate the Holy day. Hennes, 179; Martin Philipson, Ein Ministerium unter Philipp II. published 1895, p. 575. The Electorate of Cologne, circa 1580. The City of Cologne, although part of the archdiocese, was not part of the Electorate. Battle Once the cannonade began, Parma's 45 artillery pounded at the walls for 30 hours with iron cannonballs weighing 30 to 50 pounds, in total 2700 rounds were fired.Ennen, p. 186. The Spanish made several attacks, each repelled. With the ninth assault, the outer wall was breached, and soldiers poured into the city, the Italians from one end, and the Spanish from the other. They met in the marketplace in the middle (see map of the city‚Äîabove).Ennen, p. 178. Cloedt, gravely injured (his leg was reportedly nearly ripped off and he had five other serious wounds), had been carried into the town. The Spanish and Italian forces entered the town from opposing ends, and met in the middle. Parma was reportedly inclined to honor the garrison commander; Ernst demanded his blood.Motley, Chapter IX. Leonard Ennen, Geschichte der Stadt K√∂ln, v. 5, specifically p. 178. 1880. Soldiers found Cloedt and the dying man was hanged from the window, along with several dozen others in his force. Italian and Spanish soldiers, on their rampage through the city, slaughtered the rest of the garrison, even the men who tried to surrender. Women, who had taken refuge in some of the churches, were initially spared, but when the fire started, they were forced into the street. Contemporary accounts refer to children, women, and old men, their clothes in sparks or flames, trying to escape the conflagration, only to be trapped by the enraged soldiers; if they escaped the flames and the Spanish, they still had to elude the Italians. Parma wrote to the king (of Spain) that over 4000 lay dead in the ditches. English observers confirmed this report, and elaborated that only 8 buildings remained standing.Motley, Chapter IX. Aftermath Although Parma had taken the city, his Protestant opponents took some comfort in the fact that the city had been destroyed in the process and was of no use as a garrison. Yet this was in no way a Pyrrhic victory; Parma had lost fewer than 500 of his own force, and the Protestant rebels had lost a significant geographical and militarily strategic point, and one of their more intrepid young commanders in Cloedt. Parma had nearly unfettered access to the Electorate's northern regions, called the Niederstift, from which he could mount an attack on the rebellious provinces of the Netherlands. Gebhard renounced of the Electorate in 1588. Despite Ernst of Bavaria's unchallenged possession, Parma continued to acquire and fortify towns throughout the region.Ennen, p. 178; Hajo Holborn, A History of Modern Germany, The Reformation, Princeton, 1959. pp. 152‚Äì246; Motley, Chapter IX.

History The city of Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was created in 1986 by the Nevada LegislatureCommunity Redevelopment Law of the State of Nevada Urban Renewal and Development - NRS section 279.382 et. Seq. to help revitalize downtown Las Vegas. Although the RDA is legally a separate entity from the city, city council members sit on its board and approve projects, contracts and incentive programs.\\"The Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency\\", Welcome Home Nevada blog, January 20, 2011 The city of Las Vegas currently has two designated redevelopment areas. Redevelopment Area 1 encompasses 4,336 acres. The area roughly includes the greater downtown Las Vegas area east of I-15, south of Washington Avenue, north of Sahara Avenue and west of Maryland Parkway. It also includes the Charleston Boulevard, Martin L. King Boulevard and Eastern Avenue corridors. Redevelopment Area 2, consisting of approximately 1,049 acres, covers Sahara Avenue from I-15 to Decatur Boulevard, Charleston Boulevard from Rancho Drive to Rainbow Boulevard, and Decatur Boulevard from Sahara Avenue to U.S. 95. An RDA designation gives the Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency the powers to redevelop, rehabilitate and revitalize an area. This designation also allows the Redevelopment Agency to provide qualified owners/operators with certain business incentives. The RDA can aid qualifying companies located within the Redevelopment Areas with federal New Markets Tax Credits funding, Tax Increment Financing, Visual Improvement Program matching grant funds and the Downtown Las Vegas Retail Assistance Program. The RDA promotes the redevelopment of downtown Las Vegas and surrounding older commercial districts by working with developers, property owners and the community to accomplish beneficial revitalization efforts, create jobs and eliminate urban decay.\\"Downtown Las Vegas Sees a Resurgence\\", KLAS-TV, June 28, 2011 The RDA coordinates with the city of Las Vegas Economic and Urban Development Department (EUD) on day-to-day operations, development, job creation and long- term strategic goals.

It is situated on the western bank of Panama Canal, opposite Balboa. The project has been in development since 2007. London & Regional Properties and Colombian banker Jaime Gilinski formed a consortium, London & Regional Panama, to develop the Panama Pacifico business and residential community. Gilinski and his partners Ian and Richard Livingstone bested 17 other international firms to develop the project. The contract is a 40-year license for the area with an obligation to invest US$405 million over the first eight years from 2007. The project covers of land.  Development goals  The development goals set by the Panama Pacifico Agency (APP), a governmental body, at the start of the project were: * 1,400 hectares in total * 850 hectares for development * 1.0 million m2 of commercial space * 20,000 homes and apartments * 40,000 jobs created * Extensive parks, open spaces, and entertainment areas * Malls * Business and luxury hotels  Housing  The Panama Pacifico master-planned community will feature 20,000 homes in several neighborhoods: the Town Center (which includes current projects in Soleo, Mosaic, Nativa, and River Valley), Woodlands, Kobbe Hills, and Puente Verde, among others. The homes will be surrounded by the natural environment of mangroves, wetlands, and tropical forests. Luxury hotels are also planned. A downtown district, Town Center, will serve as a central point for retail, restaurant, and entertainment activities.  Economic potential  The government of Panama created the Panama Pacifico Special Economic Area under Law 41 of July 20, 2004, and with that as a base, the Agency of Special Economic Area Panama Pacifico (APP) was created, acting as an independent entity for the administration, promotion, development, regulation, and proper use of the areas assigned to the Panama Pacifico region. Companies that set up within the area enjoy special tax, labor, and legal incentives. A number of multinational corporations have already located in Panama Pacifico, including 3M, DELL, VF, BASF, Samtec, and Caterpillar. Panama Pacifico is located 15 minutes from downtown Panama City, 35 minutes from Tocumen International Airport, and adjacent to the Pan- American Highway that connects the Americas. By the end of 2012, the community is expected to complete ten new warehouse buildings in the PanAmerica Corporate Center and four Class A office buildings in the International Business Park. The developer has invested $230 million so far, and Kardonski says international firms‚Äîparticularly those involved in the maritime, light manufacturing, and technology sectors‚Äîcontinue to find Panama Pacifico an attractive option for their Latin American operations.

The house incorporates part of the Chester Rows, is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building, and is included in the English Heritage Archive. Close-up to show the inscription History The original building on the site was constructed in the 13th century but the present house was built in 1652. During the 19th century its owners wanted to demolish it but around this time the Chester and North Wales Architectural, Archaeological and Historical Society were campaigning against the loss of ancient buildings in the city. The owners agreed to a timber replacement of the building which was carried out by James Harrison in 1862. He incorporated some of the timberwork from the original house, and designed a larger and more elaborate building. The name of the house is reputed to come from its being the only house to have escaped the outbreak of plague in 1647‚Äì48 which killed 2,000 people in the city. However this house was not built until after the plague and it is more likely that it refers to the owners of the previous building on the site being spared the disease. Architecture The house is part of a terrace on the south side of Watergate Street. It is built in sandstone and timber framing with plaster panels and a slate roof. It has four storeys and a gable overlooking the street. At the street level is a modern shop front and, to the right, a set of concrete steps leading up to the row level. Set back at this level is another modern shop front. Overlooking the street is a Jacobean style railing. Above the row level is a fascia board inscribed \\"GOD'S PROVIDENCE IS MINE INHERITANCE\\". In the centre of the third storey is a central nine-pane casement window, surrounded by timber framing with recessed moulded plaster panels. Across the base of the attic storey is a row of quatrefoil braces, with a four-pane window in the centre. At the sides and above the window is more timber framing with panels similar to those on the third storey. At the top of the gable is an elaborately carved bargeboard and, at its summit, a finial. Internally in the undercroft at street level, some 13th century sandstone fabric is still present in the east party wall.

His performances led to a contract with 1st Division Silkeborg IF in the summer of 2003, following a successful trial. He helped the club regain promotion to the Danish Superliga during his first season, and became a regular for four years. In 2007, Askou failed to agree a new deal with SIF, which led to a move to Turkish football with Kasƒ±mpa≈üa. Kasƒ±mpa≈üa finished bottom of the 2007‚Äì08 S√ºper Lig, with Askou appearing frequently and scoring twice. However, despite Askou's own goal in the playoffs semi-final, the club returned to the top flight at the first attempt in 2008‚Äì09. His contract was not renewed the following summer. =Norwich City= In July 2009, Askou linked up with English League One club Norwich City on their pre- season tour of Scotland. He impressed suitably with his defensive displays in the club's friendly matches, also managing to score with a header against Airdrie United. Then manager Bryan Gunn confirmed on 27 July he had offered Askou a contract. It was revealed on 30 July that Askou had signed a two-year deal with Norwich. He made his debut in a 4‚Äì0 win over Yeovil Town in the League Cup on 11 August, helping to keep a clean sheet. Four days later, he scored on his league debut as Norwich drew 1‚Äì1 with Exeter City. Askou became a regular starter for Norwich until picking up a metatarsal injury in a league game against Yeovil in December, which kept him out until May 2010. He scored a header against Blackburn Rovers in the League Cup in August 2010; a game which Norwich lost 3‚Äì1. Askou's opportunities at Norwich were limited in the 2010‚Äì11 season, making only two Championship starts in the first half of the campaign. In January 2011, Askou moved to fellow Championship side Millwall on a one-month loan. He was sent off on his debut against Leicester City for a two-footed lunge on Yakubu.

This point was the head of navigation on this branch of the Shenandoah, and influenced the town's commercial and strategic importance. By 1832 the town had a population of 160 people. Many mills were built there, the first one in 1745, because of the availability of water power, and the proximity to water transportation to the northern Shenandoah Valley and the Potomac River. The Battle of Port Republic in June 1862 during Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign in the American Civil War centered on Port Republic. After the Civil War, Port Republic remained a locus of commerce and industry, with two iron foundries in operation by 1866.

Many Marsh covers have addresses created using addressograph plates. Oswald Marsh was not related to Victor Marsh.  Stamp dealing  Born in Belfast, into a Quaker family, his father Joseph Chandler Marsh, born in Surrey, was an architect practicing in Belfast. Marsh moved to London around 1900 where he had several addresses in the suburb of Norwood. He also briefly had offices at 1 Exeter Street, London W1, around 1914. Marsh appears to have started his stamp business some time after 1900. He is thanked in the preface to Herbert L'Estrange Ewen's Priced Catalogue of the Unadhesive Postage Stamps of the UK 1840-1905 which was published in 1905 and was well established enough to publish a book by W.H. Bertram Poole in 1906. Marsh and Ewen must have been well known to each other as Norwood stamp dealers who both had an interest in \\"unadhesive stamps\\", or cut-outs as they are now known. Marsh specialised in British and Commonwealth stamps, controls, and cut-outs from British postal stationery which adorned much of his outgoing mail. He also ran a new issue service.  Organised philately  Marsh was a life member of the Fiscal Philatelic Society.\\"List of Members, 1923\\" in The Bulletin, Fiscal Philatelic Society.

History Tico Zamora began playing guitar at an early age. Starting at the age of eight, he received daily guitar lessons from his father, Torcuato Zamora, Sr., an accomplished flamenco guitarist from Almeria, Spain. After five years of apprenticeship with his father, at age 13, the young Zamora bought his first electric guitar, a Fender Stratocaster. Zamora was greatly influenced by his older sister's record collection, which included bands such as Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles and Aerosmith. Through countless hours of playing along with and emulating what he heard on those seminal records, he discovered his passion for the electric guitar. Too young to play in nightclubs, his first performance was at a Battle of the Bands in a local Washington, D.C. area game room where he won the competition. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to join H.R. (\\"Human Rights\\"), fronted by Paul Hudson, lead singer of the influential hardcore punk band Bad Brains. This was 16-year-old Zamora's introduction to the world of punk rock. After touring and recording in the studio with H.R. for two years, H.R.'s former band, Bad Brains, went back into the studio with its original band members and released a new album, I Against I. In 1987, Zamora moved to Athens, Georgia to start a new band, Gypsy Cab Company, and immerse himself in the thriving alternative rock and new wave music scene. Two years later, Maureen Tucker, drummer for The Velvet Underground, asked Zamora to play guitar with her in the opening act for Lou Reed on his New York tour across the U.S. and Canada. In 1990, Zamora played guitar in Mo Tucker's band and toured throughout many cities in Europe, including Berlin, Germany, where Zamora lived from 1991 to 2009. In Berlin, Zamora set up a recording studio and played with and produced many bands, some of which were part of the exploding electropop/electroclash music scene occurring in Berlin in the early 2000s. Credits Tico Zamora has played guitar with, H.R. and Maureen Tucker. He has produced and played guitar and other instruments with various Berlin-based bands including Jingo de Lunch, Jan Josef Liefers, Jasmin Tabatabai, Mignon and Electrocute. His songs have been featured in movies such as HBO's Iron Jawed Angels, and Blood and Chocolate. Zamora has composed theme music for German television news and talk shows including Arabella Kiesbauer, Liebe S√ºnde, Nicole, Taff, and Bizz.  Private life  From 2003 to 2008, Tico Zamora was married to the German actress Jasmin Tabatabai. Their only child, Angelina Sherri Rose, was born on December 3, 2002. Discography=Albums= * H.R.

Instead of oil, air, or a vacuum, a sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker uses sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas to cool and quench the arc on opening a circuit. Advantages over other media include lower operating noise and no emission of hot gases, and relatively low maintenance. Developed in the 1950s and onward, SF6 circuit breakers are widely used in electrical grids at transmission voltages up to 800 kV, as generator circuit breakers, and in distribution systems at voltages up to 35 kV. Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breakers may be used as self-contained apparatus in outdoor air-insulated substations or may be incorporated into gas-insulated switchgear which allows compact installations at high voltages. Operating principle Current interruption in a high-voltage circuit breaker is obtained by separating two contacts in a medium, such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), having excellent dielectric and arc-quenching properties. After contact separation, current is carried through an arc and is interrupted when this arc is cooled by a gas blast of sufficient intensity. SF6 gas is electronegative and has a strong tendency to absorb free electrons. The contacts of the breaker are opened in a high-pressure flow of sulfur hexafluoride gas, and an arc is struck between them. The gas captures the conducting free electrons in the arc to form relatively immobile negative ions. This loss of conducting electrons in the arc quickly builds up enough insulation strength to extinguish the arc. A gas blast applied to the arc must be able to cool it rapidly so that gas temperature between the contacts is reduced from 20,000 K to less than 2000 K in a few hundred microseconds, so that it is able to withstand the transient recovery voltage that is applied across the contacts after current interruption. Sulfur hexafluoride is generally used in present high-voltage circuit breakers at rated voltage higher than 52 kV. Into the 1980s, the pressure necessary to blast the arc was generated mostly by gas heating using arc energy. It is now possible to use low-energy spring-loaded mechanisms to drive high-voltage circuit breakers up to 800 kV. Brief history  High-voltage circuit breakers have changed since they were introduced in the mid-1950s, and several interrupting principles have been developed that have contributed successively to a large reduction of the operating energy. These breakers are available for indoor or outdoor applications, the latter being in the form of breaker poles housed in ceramic insulators mounted on a structure. The first patents on the use of SF6 as an interrupting medium were filed in Germany in 1938 by Vitaly Grosse (AEG) and independently later in the United States in July 1951 by H. J. Lingal, T. E. Browne and A. P. Strom (Westinghouse). The first industrial application of SF6 for current interruption dates to 1953. High-voltage 15 kV to 161 kV load switches were developed with a breaking capacity of 600 A. The first high- voltage SF6 circuit breaker built in 1956 by Westinghouse, could interrupt 5 kA under 115 kV, but it had six interrupting chambers in series per pole. In 1957, the puffer-type technique was introduced for SF6 circuit breakers, wherein the relative movement of a piston and a cylinder linked to the moving part is used to generate the pressure rise necessary to blast the arc via a nozzle made of insulating material. In this technique, the pressure rise is obtained mainly by gas compression. The first high-voltage SF6 circuit breaker with a high short-circuit current capability was produced by Westinghouse in 1959. This circuit breaker in a grounded tank (called a dead tank), could interrupt 41.8 kA under 138 kV (10,000 MV¬∑A) and 37.6 kA under 230 kV (15,000 MV¬∑A). This performance was already significant, but the three chambers per pole and the high-pressure source needed for the blast (1.35 MPa) was a constraint that had to be avoided in subsequent developments. The excellent properties of SF6 led to the fast extension of this technique in the 1970s and to its use for the development of circuit breakers with high interrupting capability, up to 800 kV. Gas circuit breaker operation. Orange and red areas show high-pressure gas produced by motion of the breaker components. The achievement around 1983 of the first single-break 245 kV and the corresponding 420 kV to 550 kV and 800 kV, with respectively 2, 3, and 4 chambers per pole, led to the dominance of SF6 circuit breakers in the complete range of high voltages. Several characteristics of SF6 circuit breakers can explain their success: * Simplicity of the interrupting chamber which does not need an auxiliary breaking chamber * Autonomy provided by the puffer technique * The possibility to obtain the highest performance, up to 63 kA, with a reduced number of interrupting chambers * Short break time of 2 to 2.5 cycles * High electrical endurance, allowing at least 25 years of operation without reconditioning * Possible compact solutions when used for gas insulated switchgear or hybrid switchgear * Integrated closing resistors or synchronized operations to reduce switching over-voltages * Reliability and availability * Low noise levels The reduction in the number of interrupting chambers per pole has led to a considerable simplification of circuit breakers as well as the number of parts and seals required. As a direct consequence, the reliability of circuit breakers improved, as verified later on by International Council on Large Electric Systems (CIGRE) surveys. Design features= Thermal blast chambers = New types of SF6 breaking chambers, which implement innovative interrupting principles, have been developed over the past 30 years, with the objective of reducing the operating energy of the circuit breaker. One aim of this evolution was to further increase the reliability by reducing the dynamic forces in the pole. Developments since 1980 have seen the use of the self- blast technique of interruption for SF6 interrupting chambers. These developments have been facilitated by the progress made in digital simulations that were widely used to optimize the geometry of the interrupting chamber and the linkage between the poles and the mechanism. This technique has proved to be very efficient and has been widely applied for high-voltage circuit breakers up to 550 kV. It has allowed the development of new ranges of circuit breakers operated by low energy spring-operated mechanisms. right The reduction of operating energy was mainly achieved by lowering energy used for gas compression and by making increased use of arc energy to produce the pressure necessary to quench the arc and obtain current interruption. Low current interruption, up to about 30% of rated short-circuit current, is obtained by a puffer blast. Also includes more of extensive energy available . = Self-blast chambers = Further development in the thermal blast technique was made by the introduction of a valve between the expansion and compression volumes. When interrupting low currents the valve opens under the effect of the overpressure generated in the compression volume. The blow-out of the arc is made as in a puffer circuit breaker thanks to the compression of the gas obtained by the piston action. In the case of high currents interruption, the arc energy produces a high overpressure in the expansion volume, which leads to the closure of the valve and thus isolating the expansion volume from the compression volume. The overpressure necessary for breaking is obtained by the optimal use of the thermal effect and of the nozzle clogging effect produced whenever the cross-section of the arc significantly reduces the exhaust of gas in the nozzle. In order to avoid excessive energy consumption by gas compression, a valve is fitted on the piston in order to limit the overpressure in the compression to a value necessary for the interruption of low short circuit currents. Self-blast circuit breaker chamber (1) closed, (2) interrupting low current, (3) interrupting high current, and (4) open. This technique, known as \\"self-blast\\" has now been used extensively since 1980 for the development of many types of interrupting chambers. The increased understanding of arc interruption obtained by digital simulations and validation through breaking tests, contribute to a higher reliability of these self-blast circuit breakers. In addition the reduction in operating energy, allowed by the self-blast technique, leads to longer service life. = Double motion of contacts = An important decrease in operating energy can also be obtained by reducing the kinetic energy consumed during the tripping operation. One way is to displace the two arcing contacts in opposite directions so that the arc speed is half that of a conventional layout with a single mobile contact. right The thermal and self-blast principles have enabled the use of low-energy spring mechanisms for the operation of high- voltage circuit breakers. They progressively replaced the puffer technique in the 1980s; first in 72.5 kV breakers, and then from 145 kV to 800 kV. = Comparison of single motion and double motion techniques = The double motion technique halves the tripping speed of the moving part. In principle, the kinetic energy could be quartered if the total moving mass were not increased. However, as the total moving mass is increased, the practical reduction in kinetic energy is closer to 60%. The total tripping energy also includes the compression energy, which is almost the same for both techniques. Thus, the reduction of the total tripping energy is lower, about 30%, although the exact value depends on the application and the operating mechanism. Depending on the specific case, either the double motion or the single motion technique can be cheaper. Other considerations, such as rationalization of the circuit breaker range, can also influence the cost. = Thermal blast chamber with arc- assisted opening = In this interruption principle arc energy is used, on the one hand to generate the blast by thermal expansion and, on the other hand, to accelerate the moving part of the circuit breaker when interrupting high currents. The overpressure produced by the arc energy downstream of the interruption zone is applied on an auxiliary piston linked with the moving part. The resulting force accelerates the moving part, thus increasing the energy available for tripping. With this interrupting principle it is possible, during high-current interruptions, to increase by about 30% the tripping energy delivered by the operating mechanism and to maintain the opening speed independently of the current. It is obviously better suited to circuit breakers with high breaking currents, such as generator circuit breakers.  Generator circuit breakers  Generator circuit breaker rated for 17.5 kV and 63 kAGenerator circuit breakers (GCB) are connected between a generator and the step-up voltage transformer. They are generally used at the outlet of high-power generators (30 MVA to 1800 MVA) in order to protect them in a reliable, fast and economic manner. Such circuit breakers have high carrying current rating (4 kA to 40 kA), and have a high breaking capacity (50 kA to 275 kA). They belong to the medium voltage range, but the transient recovery voltage withstand capability required by IEC/IEEE 62771-37-013 is such that the specifically developed interrupting principles must be used. A particular embodiment of the thermal blast technique has been developed and applied to generator circuit breakers. The self-blast technique described above is also widely used in SF6 generator circuit breakers, in which the contact system is driven by a low-energy, spring-operated mechanism. An example of such a device is shown in the figure below; this circuit breaker is rated for 17.5 kV and 63 kA. High-power testing The short-circuit interrupting capability of high-voltage circuit breakers is such that it cannot be demonstrated with a single source able to generate the necessary power. A special scheme is used with a generator that provides the short- circuit current until current interruption and afterwards a voltage source applies the recovery voltage across the terminals of the circuit breaker. Tests are usually performed single-phase, but can also be performed three- phaseThree-phase short-circuit testing of high-voltage circuit breakers, Presented by D. Dufournet & G. Montillet at IEEE switchgear committee meeting, May 1999 Also have a small control of power.  Issues related to SF6 circuit breakers  The following issues are associated with SF6 circuit breakers: ;Toxic lower order gases When an arc is formed in SF6 gas small quantities of lower order gases are formed. Some of these byproducts are toxic and can cause irritation to eyes and respiratory systems. This is a concern if the interrupters are opened for maintenance or at disposal of the interrupters. ;Oxygen displacement SF6 is heavier than air, so care must be taken when entering low confined spaces due to the risk of oxygen displacement. ;Greenhouse gas SF6 is the most potent greenhouse gas that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has evaluated. It has a global warming potential that is 23,900 times worse than CO2. Some governments have implemented systems to monitor and control the emission of SF6 to the atmosphere.‚ÄúSynthetic Greenhouse Gases and the Emissions Trading Scheme, NZ Government, Ministry for the Environment, accessdate=23 September 2011  Comparison with other types  Circuit breakers are usually classed on their insulating medium. The follow types of circuit breakers may be an alternative to SF6 types. *air-blast *oil *vacuum *CO2 Compared with air-blast breakers, operation with SF6 is quieter and no hot gases are discharged in normal operation. No compressed-air plant is required to maintain blast air pressure. The higher dielectric strength of the gas allows more compact design or a larger interrupting rating for the same relative size as air-blast circuit breakers. This also has the desirable effect of minimizing size and weight of the circuit breakers, making foundations and installation less costly. Operating mechanisms are simpler, and less maintenance is required, generally with more mechanical operations allowed between inspections or maintenance. However, checking or replacing the SF6 gas requires special equipment and training to prevent accidental emissions. At very low outdoor temperatures, unlike air, SF6 gas can liquefy, reducing the ability of the circuit breaker to interrupt fault currents. Oil-filled breakers contain some volume of mineral oil. A minimum-oil breaker may contain on the order of hundreds of litres of oil at transmission voltages; a dead-tank bulk oil-filled circuit breaker may contain tens of thousands of litres of oil. If this is discharged from the circuit breaker during a failure, it will be a fire hazard. Oil is also toxic to water systems and leakages must be carefully contained. Vacuum circuit breakers have limited availability and are not made for transmission voltages, unlike SF6 breakers available up to 800 kV.

Business ventures He first started expanding his family business, Wheels of Africa, Rautenbach turned his focus of car design and it greatly increased the market share of Hyundai in South Africa. Circa 2004, tax evasion charges were soon leveled against him by the South African authorities resulting in asset forfeiture worth 50 million rands, which forced him to leave South Africa. The National Prosecuting Authority failed to secure a conviction and withdrew the charges two years later. Although his personal assets were returned, the legal battles against tax evasion charges cost him the Hyundai business and brought significant negative publicity. In 2006, Central African Mining & Exploration Company plc (CAMEC), a company Rautenbach became involved with, listed on the London Stock Exchange, acquired various mining operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). With the assistance of his father's trucking business, contacts in transporting minerals, and using innovative mining techniques, he successfully mined state-owned companies and attracted the attention of the government. He developed a different technique and out-mined the state company in a very short period of time: \\"We did it very selectively. We slowed down the process and picked it out in very high grade and with very little investment\\". Billy's unorthodox approach was successful, and showed the massive inefficiency of the state-run enterprises. In 1998, Laurent Kabila offered him a chance to lead state-owned Gecamines. Despite initial reluctance, he finally accepted, and in doing so, successfully turned around the fortunes of the company by cutting costs and improving efficiencies. However, the rebel-infested country began to create trouble for the Congolese government who, in a search of funds, issued allegations of misappropriation of corporate assets. Rautenbach has denied any allegations of financing the DRC war, logically stating that he was in business in the Congo long before the war broke out: \\"I started mining in the Congo about a year before the war started. So all of a sudden, the war is there because of me. It's unbelievable.\\" \\"We were very active there in getting the production going, in turning around things. We were possibly affecting people's commercial interests ... I set up a little mine there, and out-produced the major cobalt producers in the world in one year. They spend billions of dollars putting up a plant and I come there as a farmer ‚Äì me and my dad ‚Äì and we got the stuff out of the ground\\". However, stories continued circulating: allegations that he was Robert Mugabe's right-hand man, that he had bribed Kabila into securing his mining concessions, and that his mines were financing Zimbabwe's soldiers in the DRC. To date, there have not been any substantiation on claims of Rautenbach's links to Mugabe and the European Union struck him off the targeted sanctions list in February 2012. Sustainable development activities In June 2018, Rautenbach, owner of Zimbabwe Bio Energy (ZBE), became embroiled in a legal battle with joint venture stakeholders at Nuanetsi Ranch Limited, who are accusing Rautenbach of \\"sabotage, looting and making unilateral decisions without the consent of Nuanetsi Ranch Board\\". Rautenbach has significant game-ranching investments in Mwenezi, but his company, ZBE, currently faces numerous allegations relating to the \\"abuse of workers, arbitrary dismissals and non-payment of salaries\\". The 308,000 hectare cattle and wildlife management ranch is a trust property, established by former Vice President, Dr Joshua Nkomo. In a letter to Zanu PF spokesperson, Simon Khaya Moyo, Nuanetsi Ranch chairperson, Dr Liberty Mhlanga, condemns Rautenbach's alleged misconduct: \\"We have taken Billy to High Court to seek his urgent eviction because he is looting Nuanetsi Ranch's cattle and wildlife without consulting my Managing Director whom he should be working with on the Ranch [...] He has continued to loot and destroy the Ranch. I am not sure where his power is from\\", reads part of the letter, which is dated 4 April 2018. In favour of sustainable development, Rautenbach saw to it that CAMEC created employment for over 5,000 people at its Luita plant. At an average of five people per household, 25,000 people are currently being sustained as a result of this operation. The latter also saw the completion of an expatriate staff village of 3,000 people ‚Äì fondly known as Billyville by employees and contractors ‚Äì with over 200 houses, recreation facilities, staffing hostels, and a 2,000 m2 office complex. Moreover, millions of dollars were reinvested into the DRC to uplift the communities surrounding CAMEC's operations. These projects included renovations to a clinic and the provision of necessary medical equipment, and the construction of a cr√®che and primary school. Construction also included a technical college to educate 3,600 children in the skills needed at the processing plant such as mechanics, electronics and welding to help alleviate the skills shortages in the DRC. Further CSI initiatives included the reconstructing of local infrastructure i.e. the 80 km national road between Kolwezi and Likasi previously damaged by floods more than 15 years ago; power lines of 23 km from the town of Fungurume to Luita, and a state of the art water treatment system providing 40,000 litres of drinkable water per day was constructed in an area previously known for cholera. The company also commissioned and built two dams of 50,000 m3 and 1,5 million litres respectively. CAMEC's mining and production operation at Luita also helped create business opportunities for local contractors such as brickmaking plants. Subsequent activities in Zimbabwe ‚Äì Green Fuel Investments Rautenbach's greatest achievement to date has been in mobilizing investment towards bio-ethanol leading to the construction of the Green Fuel Chisumbanje ethanol plant modeled along the lines of Brazil's biofuel cane industry. The ambitious project is a build, operate and transfer partnership between government represented by the Agricultural Rural Development Authority (Arda), Green Fuel Investments (headed by Rautenbach) and two other investment partners ‚Äì Rating Investments and Macdom Investments. The 20-year pact was signed in February 2009. The project is the biggest so far in Africa. Some sections of the media claim that the project was a land grab because of the huge tracts of land bought by the investors, however, repeated monitoring visits by officials from the Zimbabwean government, the World Bank and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization qualified the industrial development as necessary for the poverty stricken district. The ethanol project has subsequently set records for Zimbabwe as being the first African country with flexi-fuel vehicle technology using blends of up to 85% ethanol and reducing the country's fuel import bill, creating over 4,500 jobs and leading Zimbabwe to a greener economy. By contributing to the production of ethanol based fuel, Green fuel has helped the country to save at least $2 million every month in fuel imports. However, the mandatory fuel blending imposed by the government on behalf of Green Fuel has been met with disdain and viewed as a symbol of Rautenbach's far reaching influence on the ZANU-PF led government. =Creation of jobs= The project, possibly Africa's largest eco-project to date, has created more jobs in Zimbabwe than any other in the last 20 years. Green Fuel is also supplying irrigation for the first time to peasant farmers working in dry areas around the sugar cane fields. It is foreseen that the venture will continue to create employment for more than 8,000 people. Already, the venture is sponsoring nearly $2,000,000 every month in salaries alone for 120 full-time employees and hundreds of contract workers from villages dotted around the ARDA estates transforming the lives of people in Chisumbanje, including others at growth points such as Checheche and in towns as far afield as Chipinge and Chiredzi. Zimbabwe does not have personnel experienced in ethanol plant construction work and through job training programmes, Green Fuel has created a set of skilled ethanol plant artisans marketable worldwide thereby empowering the local people through technological transfer. Moreover, the planned construction of the Kondo Dam for increased water volumes needed along the Save River will create more jobs for the rural populace. Further to this, a steel fabricating unit has been established in Harare with a staff of over 100 artisans involved in the manufacture of parts required for the ethanol project. 13 Local commuter bus companies in Chipinge have been contracted to ferry labor from the villages to the project site on a daily basis. More importantly, 30% of the artisans employed in the distillery and boiler sections of the ethanol plant are Zimbabweans previously based outside the country in South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique. Community leaders in Chisumbanje said they are fully behind the project as it will uplift their livelihoods, \\"We really support the project as we are the first beneficiary in the sense that development will be realised in our once marginalized area. We shall benefit economically, infrastructural and even socially\\", said one community leader. =Community irrigation construction and rehabilitation= A priority within the ethanol investment project is to ensure the local ownership component. In an effort to counter the devastating impact of years of poverty-inducing drought, a socially responsible intervention was made to provide access to water for rural farmers for all- year round farming needs. At Chisumbanje, a new 4000 hectare irrigation scheme is being developed for communal farming. To date, 700 farmers recovering from drought have been allocated new irrigation plots with packages of input to kick-start their operations. It is projected that by mid-2013, 1,080 farmers will be active irrigators and at project completion this figure should peak to 8000 plot holders. A 'community irrigation schemes water engineering department' has been created at Middle Sabi and is operational seeing to the day-to-day needs of the schemes in terms of water conveyance. The Save River and a functional irrigation system is now the lifeline of the area. As a result of the project, Checheche Growth Point has since applied for town status in anticipation of a boom in business as a state-of-the-art shopping mall and a residential area is in the offing. =Refurbishment of social service institutions= Green Fuel has commenced rehabilitative works on key public service facilities which include schools, roads and health centres. Work has commenced in this direction with initial focus on educational facilities on both estates and the major health referral centre closest to Chisumbanje-St Peters Hospital at Checheche, with the construction of new structures to cater for the swelling service demand created by the volumes of staff on site. =Commercial out grower programme= This programme targets individual farmers keen on growing sugarcane to supply the mill. The farmers are supplied with all the technical assistance in the form of land preparation for 10 hectares and inputs whose costs are deductible from their total sales after harvesting. To date, 650 hectares have been developed in the pilot programme and handed over to 241 farmers for a pioneer programme. =Effect on the Zimbabwean economy= Upon completion of the project, between 2,5 million and 2,8 million litres of ethanol will be produced daily. The production of such volumes of ethanol would be expected to end the country's importation of petrol as consumers convert to the use of the cheaper fuel. Excess ethanol- petrol export could be an important source for foreign currency. =Environmental Protection= Ethanol is a clean burning fuel that reduces air pollution and decreases greenhouse gas emissions by over 60%. As talks of climate change gather momentum, Zimbabwe joins countries such as Brazil and China in discussing how to reduce carbon footprints through investment into ethanol.

Operation Pointe Maisonnette Pointe de Maisonnette was the focal point of a minor naval operation during World War II which saw vessels of the Royal Canadian Navy ambush in late September 1943 as part of what is known as the Battle of the St. Lawrence. Canadian military intelligence and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) intercepted mail addressed to several Kriegsmarine officers (including Otto Kretschmer) imprisoned at the Camp 30 prisoner of war camp at Bowmanville, Ontario in early 1943. The correspondence detailed an escape plan, known as Operation Kiebitz, in which the prisoners were to tunnel out of the camp and make their way (using currency and false documents provided to them) through eastern Ontario and across Quebec to the northeastern tip of New Brunswick off the Pointe Maisonnette lighthouse where the POW escapees would be retrieved by a U-boat. Canadian authorities did not tip off the POWs and detected signs of tunnel digging at Camp 30 shortly afterward. All POWs except one were arrested at the time of their escape attempt; the sole POW who managed to escape travelled all the way to Pointe de Maisonette undetected, likely travelling onboard Canadian National Railways passenger trains to the Bathurst area. This POW was apprehended by military police and RCMP on the beach in front of the lighthouse the night of the arranged U-boat extraction. The RCN provided a U-boat counter-offensive force (code-named \\"Operation Pointe Maisonnette\\") that was led by , which was outfitted with an experimental version of diffuse lighting camouflage for the operation.

The original bridge was completed in 1939, and a second bridge was finished in 2009. History Begun after a flood in 1938 and completed the next year, the original bridge was the main north-south crossing of the river for seventy years. With time, however, the span became a bottleneck that figuratively split the city. Starting no later than the 1970s, people started talking about taking some sort of action, and the result was the construction of a similar bridge downstream of the original, begun in 2007. The new bridge opened for traffic and the old one was closed for renovation on August 18, 2009. The area surrounding was improved with new sidewalks, lights, and pavement. The upstream (1938) bridge carries three lanes of southbound traffic, and the downstream (2007) bridge carries three lanes northbound. A small park lies between the approaches on both sides of the river. One previous constraint was a low rail bridge to the north of the original span, which required trucks to take a circuitous route to get across the river. This bridge was replaced by a new one just south of the original, but still north of the original river crossing, with more elevation so that trucks could access the southbound (upstream) span. In 2017, work began on conversion of the abandoned train bridge, upstream of the two road bridges, to a rail trail as part of the Columbia Greenway's final extension. The trail will connect to the bridge's parks. Reconstruction of the original bridge Rehabilitation of the original bridge was halted in April 2010 because of the discovery of major deterioration of the understructure. It was reported on July 18, 2010, in The Republican of Springfield that another year would be added to the project at a cost of an additional \\"several million dollars\\", according to State Senator Michael Knapik.

Years later, as a young wife and mother, the adult Mary Rose persuades her husband to take her to the same island. Again she vanishes: this time for a period of decades. When she is found again, she is not a single day older and has no awareness of the passage of time. In the interim, her son has grown to adulthood and is now physically older than his mother. Productions Fay Compton, for whom the title role of Mary Rose was written Barrie, who normally wrote with his right hand, wrote Mary Rose with his left hand due to a \\"writer's cramp\\".Heywood Broun, Seeing Things at Night, page 127, 1921 Mary Rose first opened in London at the Haymarket Theatre, running from 22 April 1920 to 26 February 1921, with Fay Compton as Mary Rose, a role which was written for her by Barrie.The Times, 23 April 1920 It was revived (with many of the same cast still in place) in 1926.The Times, 22 January 1926 Mary Rose opened in New York on Broadway at the Empire Theatre, running from 22 December 1920 to April 1921. Direction was by Ben Iden Payne with Ruth Chatterton as Mary Rose.Mary Rose, 1920 Internet Broadway Database, accessed November 11, 2012 A revival ran on Broadway at the ANTA Playhouse, running from 4 March 1951 to 16 March 1951. The play was directed by John Stix, produced by Helen Hayes, with Mary Rose played by Bethel Leslie.Mary Rose, 1951 Internet Broadway Database, accessed November 11, 2012 The play was revived off-Broadway by the Vineyard Theater in 2007. The play was produced in a London revival in 2012 at Riverside Studios. Music Norman O'Neill's original music for the 1920 production gained widespread acclaim. At the end of the first night Barrie greeted the composer with \\"Well, O'Neill, I think we have made a success\\", and later wrote him a letter that \\"it was a lucky day for me when you had that inspiration.\\" Barrie also described the effect of the music in the stage directions of the published text, effectively incorporating the music into the play. Fay Compton wrote of \\"that beautiful, haunting music which in turn inspired us; the tremendous debt of gratitude I owed to that music I can never hope to repay.\\" Ernest Irving compared a performance of Mary Rose without O'Neill's music to \\"a dance by a fairy with a wooden leg.\\"Hudson, Derek. Letter to The Listener, 9 April, 1959, p 639 Reception In 1921, the play was included in Best Plays of 1920‚Äì1921. The New York Times reviewer called the 2007 revival of the play an \\"elegantly plotted ghost story\\". He noted, \\"The play is in many ways a more mature and mournful reworking of themes Barrie explored in the tale of the boy Peter Pan who refused to grow up. Time is seen as a quiet despoiler of happiness and innocence, and the lure of another world unblemished by its passing has an irresistible seduction.\\"Isherwood, Charles. \\"Theater Review. 'Mary Rose'\\" The New York Times, February 21, 2007 Of its London revival in 2012, a reviewer wrote that the play \\"...reveals a somewhat uncomfortable preoccupation with childhood innocence extending some of the themes of [Peter] Pan; the child who cannot grow up, and meditation on death and loss.\\"\\"Review: 'Mary Rose', Riverside Studios\\", Fourth Wall Magazine, April 4, 2012 Adaptations Alfred Hitchcock had seen the play as a young man in its original production. Later in his career as a film director, he wanted to film it, asking Jay Presson Allen to write a screenplay after she had written the screenplay for Hitchcock's film Marnie (1964). However, Hitchcock was under contract to Universal Pictures at the time, and the studio believed that the project was \\"too troubling\\", with not enough commercial appeal, so would not approve production.Joseph McBride, An Old Master's Unheard Cri de Coeur: Alfred Hitchcock's Mary Rose, Cineaste volume 26, issue 2 (01/Mar/2001), pages 24-28 In 2016, a radio play adaptation of Mary Rose was broadcast on BBC Radio 3. It was adapted and directed by Abigail le Fleming with music composed and performed by cellist Laura Moody. In 2017, Adaptive Books published the novel Mary Rose by Geoffrey Girard, a modern retelling based on the original play and Hitchcock's plans.

Finkle (1940) Frederick C. Finkle (May 3, 1865 - April 7, 1949) was an American consulting engineer and geologist. He was Chief Engineer or Consulting Engineer on eighteen major dams to impound water for domestic use, power and irrigation in California and other Western States.Fred Finkle (Finkle Family Album) Background Frederick C. Finkle was born in Viroqua, Wisconsin. He was the son of Thurston (born Torstein Finkelsen) and Sophie Amalie (born Michelet) Finkle. His father and grandparents emigrated to the U.S. in 1850 from Vestre Slidre in the Oppland, Norway. His mother's family also emigrated in 1850 from Lillehammer, Norway. His mother‚Äôs family had emigrated from Metz, France to Norway in the 17th century. Frederick Cecil Finkle (baptized as Frederick Christian Finkle) was educated at the district grammar schools and high school of Westby, and Viroqua, Wisconsin. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1887, where he majored in hydraulics and geology. He could speak, write and read eight languages including English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian. He also had a thorough knowledge of classical Latin and Greek.Press Reference Library. Southwest Edition Notables of the Southwest (page 35. Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles Examiner. 1912) Career F. C. Finkle (1895) =Early years= He began his career in California as a hydraulic engineer and geologist in January, 1887. Between 1887 and 1914, He served as: *Chief Engineer of North Riverside Land & Water Co., 1887 to 1890, in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, Calif. *City Engineer of San Bernardino, Calif., 1890 to 1892 *Chief Engineer of water resources and sanitation for California State Public Institutions, 1894 to 1895 *Chief Engineer of Redlands Electric Light & Power Co., 1895 to 1896 *Chief Engineer of Southern California Power Co., and California Power Co., 1896 to 1901 *Chief Hydraulic Engineer and Geologist for Southern California Edison Co., Ltd., 1901 to 1908 *Consulting Engineer and Geologist for Southern California Edison Co., Ltd., 1908 to 1914, during which years he was also Consulting Engineer and Geologist for The Central Colorado Power Co., and Denver Union Water Co. of Denver, Colorado; Mount Hood Railway and Power Co. of Portland, Oregon; Arrowhead Lake Co. of San Bernardino, California. =Private practice= Starting in 1914 he was in private practice as a consulting engineer and geologist, during which time he served as consulting engineer for many cities, among them, Denver Union Water Co., before the City of Denver acquired its properties; and consulting engineer for the cities of San Bernardino, San Diego, Glendale, Burbank, Beverly Hills, Ontario and others in the State of California. He had charge of flood protection works on the Colorado River, after the great flood and overflow in 1922. He was consulting engineer for the Imperial Valley Irrigation Project for three years.Guide to the Fred C. Finkle Papers, Water Resources Collection (Online Archive of California. The Regents of The University of California) He was considered an expert in hydraulic engineering and historical and structural geology, and one of the highest authorities on the market value of water rights for power and irrigation in the Western States. He held the world‚Äôs record for expert testimony on hydraulics and geology, having testified for 121 days in court during 1927-28 in the trial of the water rights case of Rancho Santa Margarita vs. Vail Co., et al., in San Diego County, California. He reported on the defects in design and construction of the St. Francis Dam for Los Angeles, and predicted its failure four years before it failed with property loss of $20,000,000 and loss of 631 lives. He also reported on the defects of Mulholland Dam in Hollywood, which was reconstructed to make it safe by strengthening the down slope, and lowering the spillway. During his long professional career, he reported against political schemes which were not for public benefit. This resulted in attacks upon him by politicians, against all of which he successfully defended and completely vindicated himself. In 1927-28, when the \\"Forks Dam\\" project was proposed on San Gabriel River by Los Angeles County, but condemned by him as impracticable, which was later demonstrated as so after wasting $5,000,000 on the project, he was employed as expert in a suit whereby most of the money was recovered for the taxpayers, and was presented with an engraved resolution of commendation by the Harbor District Chambers of Commerce. Politicians in Orange County, California, published a libelous attack on him when he reported against the location they proposed for the Prado Dam on Santa Ana River. He brought suit against the signer of the libelous letter, in which suit, case No. 26483 in Orange County. He was vindicated by securing judgment for both actual and exemplary damages with costs. This happened in 1929-30. Later, the U. S. Army Engineers sustained him by rejecting the location he had condemned and constructing the Prado Dam where he had suggested. During 1941, he gave a 49-day deposition in ease No. 764-RJ-Civil, in the U. S. District Court, Southern District of California, Central Division, as an expert on the values of water rights sold by the Nevada‚ÄîCalifornia Electric Corp. to the City of Los Angeles, which involved capital gains tax on profit from the sale. Because his testimony showed that the government appraiser was not qualified and his figures were erroneous, this agent secured a secret indictment from the Grand Jury charging perjury. This indictment was nullified by the 1942 Federal Grand Jury upon his appearance before it, and the U. S. Attorney General directed the dismissal of the whole matter in 1942. He contributed articles to some of the \\"Water Supply and Irrigation Papers\\" published by the United States Geological Survey, and to the National Irrigation Congress, Engineering Magazine and Engineering News-Record. He was a vigorous and vocal opponent of Prohibition who wrote to President Hoover urging him to support modifying the restrictive liquor laws that he believed were adversely affecting the vitality and economic life of the nation.

The first Audyssey technology was released in home theater receivers in 2004. It addressed the negative effects of room acoustics on sound reproduction. Since then, Audyssey has delivered several audio technologies that seek to overcome acoustical limitations in audio systems and better match human perception. Since 2004 Audyssey technologies have appeared in numerous consumer, professional, and automotive products. Technologies= Room Acoustics Correction ‚Äì MultEQ and EQ = Audyssey MultEQ: A technology that allows consumers and professionals to fix the acoustical problems in rooms that arise from the interaction of sound from the loudspeakers with the surfaces in the room. MultEQ uses acoustical measurements in the time domain taken by a microphone around the listening area and combines this information to evaluate the acoustical problems that cause audible distortions in the frequency response. MultEQ then creates a room equalization filter for each speaker and subwoofer in the system to correct these problems. Audyssey EQ is a direct extension of MultEQ for products that come with attached loudspeakers such as televisions and home theater in a box systems. =Loudness Compensation ‚Äì Dynamic EQ= Audyssey Dynamic EQ: A technology that solves the problem of deteriorating sound quality as the playback volume is decreased. Dynamic EQ combines information from incoming source levels and actual output sound levels in the room or car to make moment-by-moment adjustments that compensate for the changes in human hearing at different listening levels. =Volume Leveling ‚Äì Dynamic Volume= Audyssey Dynamic Volume: A technology that solves the problem of constantly varying volume across program material. It monitors the volume in real time and maintains the desired listening level for all content while optimizing the dynamic range. =Surround Envelopment ‚Äì Audyssey DSX= Audyssey Dynamic Surround Expansion (DSX): A scalable technology that expands the soundstage of surround sound content by adding width and height loudspeaker channels. Audyssey DSX then synthesizes the necessary content for these channels to reproduce the necessary acoustical and perceptual cues that enhance soundstage rendering for surround sound.

I watched just about everything, including the junk. The screen teemed with unsummable activity. It was full of visions, legends, myths, fables. T.V was scarcely something you could feel superior to. It was too various. What I had to offer was negative capability, a capability for submission to the medium. I was the first to submit myself to Alastair Burnet and find him fascinating. No critic before me had ever regarded David Vine as a reason for switching the set on.\\" In the preface James says that the idea of publishing a selection of his television criticism had been in his mind since speaking with Kenneth Tynan at a reception at the Garrick Club. Tynan had said he hoped James would publish some of his criticism but averred that, \\"A television critic would have to know everything, and who knows everything?\\" James had been lost for an answer at the time but in the Preface replies, \\"It isn't necessary to know everything ‚Äì just to remember that nobody else does either.\\" External links * Visions Before Midnight on Clive James' official website 1977 non-fiction books Books about television 1970s in British television Works originally published in The Observer Television criticism Jonathan Cape books ","title":"Visions Before Midnight"},{"id":"23766166","text":"The World's End is a 2013 science fiction comedy film directed by Edgar Wright, written by Wright and Simon Pegg, and starring Pegg, Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan and Rosamund Pike. The film follows five friends who discover that there is an alien invasion in their old home town during an epic pub crawl. Wright has described the film as social science fiction in the tradition of John Wyndham and Samuel Youd (John Christopher). It is the third and final film in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, following Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Hot Fuzz (2007). The film was produced by Relativity Media, StudioCanal, Big Talk Productions, and Working Title Films. It grossed $46.1 million against a $20 million budget.  Plot  Gary King is a forty year old alcoholic, who still retains the mindset and immaturity of his teenage years, whereas his four childhood friends, Peter, Oliver, Steven, and Andy, have all matured and each of their relationships toward Gary are presently estranged. One day, Gary, in an attempt to recapture the days of his youth, tracks down his friends to complete the \\"Golden Mile\\", a pub crawl encompassing the 12 pubs of their hometown of Newton Haven, the last of them being the World's End. The group attempted the crawl as teenagers, but failed to reach the final three pubs. Andy, now a teetotaler due to a drunk driving accident in which he and Gary were involved years ago, agrees to join them despite being uncomfortable with the idea. The crawl begins, and in the second pub, the group are joined by Oliver's sister Sam, whose affections Gary and Steven fought over in school. Throughout the beginning of the crawl, the town residents appear eerily stoic and none seem to recognise the group. In the toilets of the fourth pub, Gary picks a fight with a teenager and knocks his head off, exposing him as an android. Gary's friends join him and fight the remaining members of the teenager's gang, all revealed to be androids themselves. The group realise that the entire town's population has been replaced with androids, which the group later refer to as \\"blanks\\". In shock, Andy abandons his teetotal lifestyle. Despite this realisation, Gary urges the others to continue the pub crawl so as not to arouse suspicion. As they continue, they discover that aliens intend to build a prosperous, galactic conglomerate with humanity beside them, but should any human refuse to join then, they replace them with blank versions of the original human host. Oliver is revealed to have been replaced, and Peter is captured. Despite this, Gary is still determined to finish the pub crawl, as he believes it is all he has left. Andy is forced to abandon Steven when the blanks attack, and chases after Gary to the final pub. At the World's End, Andy confronts Gary and the two fight; in the midst of the scuffle, Andy reveals his marriage is in trouble and Gary's sleeves are torn off, revealing bandages applied after a recent suicide attempt. Andy tries to stop Gary from drawing his final pint, but Gary states he clings to his goal of completing the Mile due to his sense that he has not achieved and cannot achieve anything else in life. Once Gary attempts to pour his pint, the pull of the lever reveals a hidden chamber. A disembodied alien entity, known as the Network, tells them that the blank invasion has been responsible for the technological advances in telecommunication over recent decades as part of a first step to joining a galactic community. It offers Gary eternal youth if he agrees to become a blank, but Gary refuses. Along with Andy and Steven, who had survived the blanks attack, Gary gets into a foul-mouthed debate with the Network, calling out the tyranny in the latter's plan and demanding that humanity should be left to its own devices. Eventually, the Network, exasperated, abandons the invasion; the departure triggers a nuclear pulse across the town, but Sam arrives in time to drive the group out of Newton Haven as it self- destructs. Some time later, the destruction of Newton Haven has triggered a worldwide electromagnetic pulse that destroyed all electrical power on Earth, sending humanity back to the Dark Ages. The remaining blanks have reactivated, achieving independence without the presence of the Network, but are mistrusted by surviving humans. Andy's marriage has recovered, Steven is in a relationship with Sam, and the blank versions of Peter and Oliver have returned to a semblance of their former lives. In the ruins of Newton Haven, the now-sober Gary enters a pub with the blank versions of his younger friends and orders water. When the bartender refuses to serve blanks, Gary leads his new friends into a brawl.

He realised the idea could work with adult characters to capture \\"the bittersweet feeling of returning to your home town and feeling like a stranger\\". Wright said he wanted to satirise the \\"strange homogeneous branding that becomes like a virus\\", explaining: \\"This doesn't just extend to pubs, it's the same with caf√©s and restaurants. If you live in a small town and you move to London, which I did when I was 20, then when you go back out into the other small towns in England you go 'oh my god, it's all the same!' It's like Bodysnatchers: literally our towns are being changed to death.\\" In an interview for Entertainment Weekly, Pegg told Clark Collis, \\"People think we choose the genre first every time, and it's not true. We find the stories first. The notion of alienation from your hometown taken to its literal conclusion was how we got to science fiction.\\" After the story was complete, Wright and Pegg examined a list of real pub names and \\"tried to make them like tarot cards\\" to foreshadow the events of the story. Wright explained: \\"So we said, 'OK this one's the Famous Cock, because this is where Gary is trying to puff up his own importance.' ... We did go through and work out in each one how the pub sign was going to relate.\\"  Production  The Gardeners Arms pub on the boundary of Letchworth was used as the shooting location for the final pub, the World's End Principal photography for The World's End began on 28 September 2012. Filming took place in Hertfordshire, at Elstree Studios, Letchworth Garden City, and Welwyn Garden City. Part of the film was also shot at High Wycombe railway station, Buckinghamshire. All twelve pubs in the film use identical signage on menus and walls, reflecting what Wright called \\"that fake hand-written chalk\\" common to modern British pubs. The exteriors of the real pubs were shot at locations in Welwyn Garden City and Letchworth Garden City, with altered signage. Letchworth Garden City railway station got a makeover as the \\"Hole in the Wall\\". Stunts were coordinated by Brad Allen of martial arts film director Jackie Chan's team. Wright said: \\"In Drunken Master, Jackie Chan has to get drunk to fight, but this is more the idea of Dutch courage. You know, when you're kind of drunk and you think 'ah, I can climb up that scaffolding!' Or just that you're impervious to pain. One of the things we talked about is this idea that [the characters] become better fighters the more oiled they get.\\" The Broadway Cinema, Letchworth, a renovated independent cinema built in a quintessentially Art Deco style in the 1930s, was used to portray the Mermaid pub. This cinema was also the first outside London to play the film, with a special introduction by Pegg thanking the residents of Letchworth for their help during its making; over 800 viewers watched the film at the cinema on its opening night.  Soundtrack  The film uses what the New York Posts Kyle Smith called \\"a brilliant Madchester soundtrack\\", alternative rock and pop music from the time of the characters' adolescence. Wright explained: \\"A lot of those songs are ones that really hit me and Simon hard when we were that age... [Gary] is still living by those rules. It's like he decided to take 'Loaded' and 'I'm Free' to heart and thinks the party's never going to end.\\" The soundtrack for the film was released on 5 August 2013 in the UK and 20 August 2013 in the United States, with the film's score, composed by Steven Price, released on the same day. The only songs featured in the film that did not make it onto the soundtrack are \\"The Only One I Know\\", \\"Summer's Magic\\" and \\"The Only Rhyme That Bites\\", by The Charlatans, Mark Summers and 808 State respectively. The version of \\"20 Seconds To Comply\\" which features in the film is the mix from Silver Bullet's album \\"Bring Down The Walls No Limit Squad Returns\\" albeit edited to remove dialogue samples from RoboCop. On the soundtrack album, it is replaced by the Bomb Squad mix (again re-edited to remove the samples). The original soundtrack tributes the song \\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\\" by Yes when the young characters reach the hills. = Track list = In addition to songs featured in the movie, the album also features dialogue snippets.

The girls' bodies were discovered in Jacks' home in January 2008 by federal marshals carrying out an eviction; the girls had died in the summer of 2007. The case led to scrutiny of the Washington social service agencies that failed to prevent the deaths or discover them in the months afterward; four days after the bodies were found, the city's mayor Adrian Fenty fired six employees of Washington's Child and Family Services Agency, saying they \\"just didn't do their job.\\"Dvorak, Petula and Namakura, David. \\"Fenty Fires 6 in Girls' Deaths.\\" The Washington Post, 2008-01-15, p.

After having her second child, Tatianna Jacks, Banita met Nathaniel Fogle in 2000, while she was working as a hairdresser, and subsequently gave birth to N'Kiah and Aja Fogle. In 2005, Jacks and her four daughters lived with Mamie Jacks for a short time after being evicted, but they moved out when Mamie Jacks refused to allow Fogle to stay with them. The family lived in a variety of places, including a homeless shelter, before a nonprofit organization helped them to move into the Washington, DC, rowhouse in August 2006.Government of the District of Columbia Office of the Inspector General (April 2009).

Neighbors and family members described Jacks as a caring and attentive mother until the period following Nathaniel Fogle's death in February 2007. Until Jacks' 2008 arrest, her mother had not seen her or the children since 2005, but said in court that she had no reason to believe the children were in danger, in spite of a 2006 call that she made to the Charles County social services department for information about the girls. Mamie Jacks testified, \\"I never saw her mistreat the girls, and the girls never complained about her mistreatment.\\" However, LaShawn Ragland, a friend with whom the Jacks/Fogles had lived for several months in 2006, testified about arguments between Brittany and Banita Jacks and Banita's punishing her oldest daughter by denying her food and isolating her from the younger girls.Alexander, Keith L. \\"Decomposition Made M.E.'s Job Difficult.\\" The Washington Post, 2009-07-21. Ragland also said that Jacks and Fogle often allowed their daughters Aja and N'Kiah, aged 3 and 4 years old at the time, to smoke marijuana while their parents laughed. Her boyfriend, Nathaniel Fogle Jr., died of cancer in February 2007. Changes in behavior following Fogle's death After Fogle's death, Jacks grew increasingly isolated. Jacks did not attend Fogle's funeral, and family members said Jacks did not tell her daughters that Fogle had died. A neighbor testified that Jacks had taken the neighbor's daughter to McDonald's along with Jacks' own children in March 2007, and that Jacks' daughters were always \\"clean and their hair was always done\\"; when the neighbor saw Jacks again a month later, her children were wearing white T-shirts and rags on their head.Alexander, Keith L. \\"Boyfriend of Jacks's Daughter Tells of Last Time Seeing Her.\\" The Washington Post, 2009-07-18. Jacks told the neighbor that the family's food stamps had run out but she was reluctant to apply for more, due to the paperwork required. Fogle's mother said that after her son's funeral, she had come by the Jacks home several times to see her grandchildren, but Jacks either would not let her in or would call and tell her not to return. Brittany Jacks' boyfriend Leepoy Kelly testified that he saw Brittany for the last time in March 2007, after Brittany had been absent from school for about a month, and that she \\"seemed a little sad.\\" After their brief visit, Brittany stopped responding to Kelly's calls to her cellphone or messages to her MySpace account.

At the time, Lopes was an employee of Booker T. Washington Charter School, which Brittany attended.

Over the next few days, Lopes made repeated calls to CFSA as well as to the police. As a result of Lopes' call, police sergeant James Lafranchise visited the Jacks home on April 30, 2007, and interviewed Banita Jacks in her front yard. Lafranchise did not file a report of the visit until January 9, 2008, on the day that the girls' bodies were discovered.

In the initial report, Lafranchise said that he had seen only the three younger girls on his visit; he filed a follow-up report on January 13 that said he \\"thought\\" he had seen Brittany as well. He reported during the homicide investigation that the girls, including Brittany, appeared \\"clean and well fed, healthy and playful.\\" When questioned at Jacks' trial, Lafranchise said that he had not seen Brittany at the house; he said that he had not been told to look for a teenager and assumed he was there to check on the three younger girls, even though he spoke with Lopes on his cell phone while he was at the Jacks home. The D.C. police department said that they would be conducting an internal investigation of Lafranchise and the inconsistent reports. On May 10, Lopes wrote a letter to the youth social service division of D.C. Superior Court, expressing her fear that Brittany Jacks was \\"being held hostage.\\" Social workers did not investigate her concerns. In May 2007, Jacks moved all the furniture from her house into the backyard and started losing weight. Jacks told another neighbor, whom she often asked for water and cigarettes, that she had cancer. During the summer, Jacks's former neighbors smelled a foul odor in the area, which some guessed was a dead rat. The last person to see any of the children alive was a neighbor and family friend, Tywana Richardson, who delivered Social Security checks to Jacks twice a month; Richardson said that she saw the two youngest girls in the family's living room in June 2007. Richardson had not seen Brittany Jacks for several months.Peterson, Hayley. \\"Friends, family testify Jacks cut off contact.\\" The Washington Examiner, 2009-07-16. Discovery of bodies and trial On January 9, 2008, federal marshals came to Jacks' home to serve her with eviction. Jacks came to the door wearing only a white T-shirt and refused to allow them inside. The marshals forced their way past the door, and marshal Nicholas Garrett said he could immediately smell an odor of \\"rotting meat, like stink bait\\" which he thought was \\"rotten or spoiled food.\\" In an upstairs bedroom, they found the bodies of the three younger girls, lined up according to age, each wearing a white T-shirt. The body of Brittany Jacks was in another upstairs bedroom, nude and lying on the floor in a pool of blood, underneath a white T-shirt.Alexander, Keith L. \\"Jacks Defense Denies Guilt As Grim Tale Opens Trial.\\" The Washington Post, 2009-07-16. Medical examiners who examined the bodies determined that the three younger girls had been strangled and that Brittany had been stabbed repeatedly, but due to the bodies' high level of decomposition, examiners were unable to definitively attribute these injuries as causing the girls' deaths. According to Jacks, all four of her daughters had died in their sleep, although she had made unsuccessful attempts to revive them.Alexander, Keith L. \\"In Video, Jacks Tells of Dreams, Ordeals.\\" The Washington Post, 2009-07-14. Jacks' trial on twelve charges, including premeditated first-degree murder, felony murder, and cruelty to children towards each of her four daughters, began on July 15, 2009 in Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Jacks pled not guilty and rejected an insanity defense. The verdict, guilty on all charges except the first-degree murder of Brittany Jacks, was decided by the presiding judge, Frederick H. Weisberg. On 18 December 2009, following her conviction, Jacks was sentenced by Judge Weisberg to 120 years in prison (30 years for each murder). Weisberg rejected a defense motion calling into question Jacks' earlier refusal to use an insanity defense. He also rejected the defense's suggestion that the sentences should run concurrently. Other aftermath of incident Two days following the discovery of the dead bodies of the Jacks- Fogle children, mayor Adrian Fenty announced findings of a preliminary investigation of District agency involvement and previewed reforms to take place in District government operations in response to the tragedy. \\"Fenty Presents Timeline of District Government Contact with Jacks Family, Outlines initial efforts to ensure child welfare accountability.\\"]The Washington Post, 2008-01-11. In April 2009, the D.C. Office of the Inspector General released a report implicating not only the CFSA, but several other local government parties for failing to meet their obligations in the Jacks case and potentially prevent the four deaths. The Washington Post reported: > The family was supposed to receive monthly visits based on its housing > placement; it never did. The school system didn't follow through when the > girls dropped out of school. Police didn't fully investigate when they were > called to the house. And health-care providers did not follow up on things > that should have been red flags, according to the report. The report also faulted an overall lack of coordination and communication between the various agencies involved with the family.Dvorak, Petula. \\"Plenty of Blame to Go Around in Girls' Deaths, Report Finds.\\" The Washington Post, 2009-04-03. To enhance agency communication and coordination, mayor Adrian Fenty proposed legislation [\\"DC Register Volume 56 2009: Jacks-Fogle Family Preservation Case Coordination Authorization Act of 2009.\\"]www.dcregs.dc.gov, 2009. which was passed into law.\\"L18-0273 \\"Data-sharing and Information Coordination Amendment act of 2010\\"www.dccouncil.us, 2010. This legislation amended the District of Columbia confidentiality rules to make them less rigid and more aligned with what is permitted under federal privacy laws such as HIPAA and FERPA. In mid-2008, the foreclosed home where the Jacks family lived and the bodies were found was put up for sale. Assessed at a value of $220,610, the house was listed with a selling price of $163,000 in September 2008, which slid downward to $90,900 by February 2009.

Ogle's cabin is a type known as a \\"saddlebag\\" cabin (two single-pen cabins joined by a common chimney), which was a relatively rare design in the region. Ogle's barn is an excellent example of a four-pen barn, a design once common in the area, although this barn is the last remaining four-pen barn in the park. Ogle's tub mill is the park's last surviving operational tub mill and one of the few operational tub mills in the region. A later owner of the Ogle farm renamed the farm \\"Junglebrook,\\" and the farm is thus sometimes referred to as the \\"Junglebrook Historic District.\\" Location The Noah Ogle Place is situated near LeConte Creek (formerly known as Mill Creek) in the upper drainage of the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River. Gatlinburg lies opposite the park boundary to the north, Roaring Fork lies opposite the hills to the east, the Sugarlands lies opposite the hills to the west, and Mount Le Conte rises to the south. Cherokee Orchard Road (still occasionally referred to as Airport Road) connects the Noah Ogle Place to U.S. Route 441 in downtown Gatlinburg to the north and to the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail to the south. The site's tub mill is situated on the banks of LeConte Creek, approximately from the cabin and barn. History Ogle barn Noah Ogle's great-grandparents, William Ogle (1756-1803) and his wife Martha Huskey (1756-1826), were the first Euro-American settlers in the Gatlinburg area, arriving in the early 19th century (their cabin still stands on the Arrowmont School campus in downtown Gatlinburg).Noah Wilson \\"Bud\\" Ogle -- entry at Smokykin.com. Retrieved: 27 July 2009. The Ogles' descendants quickly spread out into the adjacent river and creek valleys. Noah Ogle's farm originally consisted of , although by the early 20th century he had subdivided his land among his children, and retained only . These last comprise the bulk of the Bud Ogle Farm historic district. Ogle's cabin and outbuildings were built in the late 1880s and early 1890s. The land was poor and rocky (the National Park Service later claimed it was \\"unsuitable\\" for farming), and Ogle mostly grew corn. The land did include a sizeable apple orchard which grew multiple types of apples. Ogle's relatives were allowed free use of his tub mill, while others were charged a small percentage of meal. Excess corn and apples were shipped to markets in Knoxville. Ogle's wife, Lucinda Bradley Ogle, was a local midwife.Lucinda Oakley Ogle, Jerry Wear (editor), Sugarlands: A Lost Community of Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tenn.: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), pp. 41-59. Along with the surviving structures and typical mountain farm outbuildings, Ogle's farm included a so-called \\"weaner cabin.\\" A weaner cabin was typically a small cabin near the main house where the farmer's children could live for a brief period after marrying. Several of Ogle's sons lived in the Ogle weaner cabin after their respective marriages. The weaner cabin is no longer standing, although a pile of rubble remains from its foundation. In the 1920s, several investors established a commercial apple orchard and ornamental nursery known as \\"Cherokee Orchard\\" just south of the Ogle homestead. When the Tennessee Park Commission began buying up property for the creation of the national park in the late 1920s, the owners of Cherokee Orchard threatened to fight a major appropriations for bill for the park's funding if their land was condemned. The orchard's owners dropped their opposition in 1931 in exchange for a long lease on the property.Carlos Campbell, Birth of a National Park In the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), pp. 53, 103-105. Historic structures Ogle tub mill, viewed from LeConte Creek =Noah Ogle cabin= The Noah Ogle cabin consists of two cabins sharing a single chimney, known as a \\"saddlebag\\" cabin. The cabins were built approximately five years apart, the second cabin being added as Ogle's family grew. Both cabins measure by , and each consists of one story and a loft. The cabin's walls consist of hewn logs connected by half-dovetail notches, with six doors (one on the front and back wall of each cabin, and two next to the chimney to allow quick passage between the two buildings). Each cabin has a split-oak shingled roof, a sawn board floor, and hearths made of rubble. The cabin's windows were initially shuttered, but eventually replaced with glass. One cabin has a small window near the floor that allowed chickens to enter to escape predators. A covered porch spans both the front and back walls of both cabins. Images of the cabin were also used by Sleepycabin (a group of web animators) as background images for Sleepycast, a comedy podcast where they would talk about personal experiences. =Ogle barn= The Ogle barn is the last remaining four-pen barn in the park. It consists of four pens, each one story with a loft, covered by a split-shingled roof. Like the cabin, the barn's walls are constructed of hewn logs connected by half-dovetail notches. The park service made numerous repairs to the barn in the 1960s. =Tub mill= Ogle's tub mill is the last of at least 13 tub mills once located along LeConte Creek. The millhouse is an by building resting on mudsills and round log supports above LeConte Creek, about a half-mile from Ogle cabin and barn. The walls consist of logs connected with saddle notches, and the floor consists of hewn puncheon logs. A vertical shaft beneath the millhouse connects the grindstones with a \\"tub wheel\\" turbine. An hollowed-log flume diverts water from the creek to the turbine. The mill was restored to its operational condition in the 1960s.

Family  Charlotte Georgine was born in Hanover, Electorate of Hanover. She was the eldest child and daughter of Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg and his first wife, Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt. Charlotte and her sisters, Queen Louise of Prussia, Queen Frederica of Hannover and Princess Therese of Thurn und Taxis, were considered the most beautiful women of their time. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter dedicated his novel Titan to the \\"four beautiful and noble sisters on the throne\\".Jean Paul: Collected Works, Paris, 1836 S. 495  Life =Childhood and youth= Charlotte grew up in Hanover, where her father served as governor, on behalf of his brother-in-law, King George III of the United Kingdom, who lived in London. When Charlotte was twelve years old, her mother died and she was brought up by her mother's sister, Charlotte, who married her father in 1784, and also by Magdalena of Wolzogen. Her sisters were brought by her grandmother, Countess Maria Louise Albertine of Leiningen- Falkenburg-Dagsburg in Darmstadt. Charlotte had then already moved to Hildburghausen. = Duchess of Saxony-Hildburghausen = Duchess Charlotte of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1769-1818), pastel by Johann Philipp Bach, ca.1790 On 3 September 1785, at the age of fifteen, Charlotte married Duke Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, who stood until 1787 under regency of his great-great uncle Joseph Frederick. The marriage was not a happy one; Charlotte was mentally superior to Frederick, who began to ignore her. They also had financial problems; Saxe-Hildburghausen had been financially ruined by the disastrous policies of Frederick's predecessors and in 1806 it had been put into Imperial receivership. The receivers allowed the Duke and Duchess only a reduced Civil List. Charlotte's father and two brothers often stayed with Charlotte in Hildburghausen. In 1787, her father moved to Hildburghausen permanently, and became president of the credit committee. In 1792, Charlotte's grandmother and her sisters fled before the advancing French army from Darmstadt to Hildburghausen. Her grandmother noticed of Charlotte's husband .... of all his duties, he only fulfills his marital duties with zeal. Charlotte, who never loved this man, is always pregnant.H. P.

Charlotte had a very intimate and loving relationship with her sister Friederike and relatives in Strelitz. In 1803 and 1805, the Prussian royal couple visited Hildburghausen. For this occasion, the receivers allowed the ducal couple to renew some of their furniture.Dr. Rudolf Armin Human: Chronik der Stadt Hildburghausen Hildburghausen 1886 S. 238 On 9 October 1806, Charlotte and her sister Therese were visiting their sister Louise at the headquarters in Erfurt of king Frederick William III of Prussia, when he declared war on Napol√©on Bonaparte. Louise had helped draft the declaration of war. Duchess Charlotte of Saxe-Hildburghausen, painting by Heinrich Vogel, c. 1815 Christian Truchse√ü von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg was a friend of the ducal couple and godfather of Charlotte's son Edward. After Charlotte and her daughter Therese, who was Crown Pricess of Bavaria at the time, visited his Bettenburg Castle in Franconia, Christian wrote to Fouqu√©: Our Crown Pricess of Bavaria and the Hereditary Princess of Weilburg were visiting their mother, the Duchess of Hildburghausen; and since I have known these lovely daughters since childhood, and they had always been kindly disposed towards me, they felt the urge to visit the old Truchse√ü on his castle and they and their brother George and the Hereditary Prince of Weilburg, the brave man of Waterloo and really only a small suite came to me on a Sunday afternoon.Karl K√ºhner: Dichter, Patriarch und Ritter, Frankfurt, 1869 p. 156 Many spectators had come to see the Bavarian Crown Princess. When receiving his guests, Truchse√ü tried to lead the lower-ranking Charlotte first into his castle, but she refused, referring to her daughter. Truchse√ü replied: Your Highness will forgive me, but as long as this castle has stood here, mothers have always enjoyed precedence before their daughters. Therese then grabbed the baron's other arm, and the three of them walked through the gate together.Dr. Rudolf Armin Human: Chronik der Stadt Hildburghausen, Hildburghausen, 1886 p. 205 ff. The Duchess gave about half of her annual income to the poor, pensioners, and education and apprenticeships for the lower classes. After her sister's death in 1815, she erected the Louise Memorial in the Hildburghausen City Park. = Court of the Muse = Charlotte was interested in literature and avidly promoted the arts at court. She relaxed the rules and etiquette and brought musicians, painters, and poets to the court, among them the writer Jean Paul Friedrich Richter, who arrived in May 1799. On 25 May 1799, he wrote to his friend Otto: I've been here a week now, and I'm quite weak. For starters, imagine the heavenly Duchess, with beautiful child-like eyes, her face full of love and attraction and youth, a glottis like a nightingale and a mother's heart [...] they love and read me [...]. They ask me in the afternoon and in the evening [...]. Yesterday, I improvised for the court on the grand piano. Besides, there's a decent parish of brothers and sisters here, and I can be Zinzendorf.Dr. Rudolf Armin Human: Chronik der Stadt Hildburghausen, Hildburghausen, 1886, p. 204 ff On 27 October 1799, he again wrote to Otto: I knew ahead of time that the court would stay at their Jagdschloss at Seidingstadt; I went there today. The Duchess was already there when I arrived and saw me within minutes of my arrival. Apart from a lover, I know of nothing more beautiful than her sweet shape.Dr. Rudolf Armin Human: Chronik der Stadt Hildburghausen, Hildburghausen, 1886, p. 205 Charlotte gave the commoner Jean Paul Friedrich Richter the title of a Legation Council and the writer was engaged to one of her ladies in waiting.Gunter de Bruyn: The life of Jean Paul Friedrich Richter, Halle-Leipzig, 1975, p. 210 However, the engagement to Caroline Feuchter von Feuchtersleben was later dissolved. Under Charlotte, the Court developed to a \\"little Weimar\\". The current slogan of the town of Hildburghausen, \\"Little Classic\\", refers back to this period. Beside Jean Paul, other contemporaries have also testified to Charlotte's extraordinary singing talent. She was given the nickname \\"Singlotte\\" and the reputation of being one of the greatest singers of her day.Heinrich Ferdinand Sch√∂ppl: Die Herzoge von Sachsen-Altenburg, Bolzano, 1917, reprint Altenburg, 1992, p. 158. She was taught singing in Hanover by an Italian named Giuliani and sang in concerts at court and church services. During Holy Week, she regularly sang \\"Death of Jesus\\" by Carl Heinrich Graun at Christ Church of Hildburghausen, in which the entire population was allowed into the church.  Death  Charlotte candelabra in the cemetery of Hildburghausen Charlotte died in Hildburghausen, Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, on 14 May 1818 after a long illness. Her daughter Therese reported to her sister Louisa, \\"Eight or ten days ago, during an anxious night, in which the end seemed near, she said us all a farewell and blessed all you far away loved ones - that's the best a good loving mother can give to her children [...] That night, when she bade us farewell in the most touching manner, I knelt down beside her bed of pain and asked for her blessing. When her hand rested on my head, I spoke for us all, dear mother - and she answered [...]. We all have received a (ring) from her dear hands. Looking at it, my intent to always live a life worthy of my mother, grew ever more steadfast in my heart.H. P. Wulff-Woesten: Hildburgh√§user Hoheiten - Dem Volk verbunden, Hildburghausen, 1992, p. 26 Charlotte decreed that she was to be buried in the newly planned cemetery at Backsteinfeld in Hildburghausen. She was provisionally buried in the church of the castle, and reburied at Backsteinfeld in 1819. Her tomb was designed by Heim, the court carpenter, and was completed in 1824. The green bronzed candelabra stands on four black balls with blazing flames in lead in a shell at the top. The inscription was written by Friedrich Carl Ludwig Sickler. The vault has a height of 4 meters and a diameter of about 12 meters. When the church of the castle was converted into a courtroom, the bodies of all the royals were moved from the royal crypt to Charlotte's tomb.  Marriage and issue Charlotte married Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen (later Duke of Saxe-Altenburg), youngest child of Ernest Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen and his third wife, Princess Ernestine of Saxe-Weimar, on 3 September 1785 in Hildburghausen.

Background In 1997, Cardoza left the Miami-Dade Police Department, transferring to the Los Angeles Police Department following the conclusion of a case which led to Horatio Caine becoming the lead CSI Agent. Although Jesse didn't say it, presumably the reason why he left Miami for Los Angeles was due to a disappointment in love. He recommended the hire of Tim Speedle to Horatio. Cardoza returned in 2009 as a member of Caine's team. Jesse was a womanizer although very discreet in this matter and in the Season 8 episode, \\"L.A\\", it was revealed that a lack of evidence on a case involving the man suspected of killing of a woman whom Cardoza called \\"my wife\\" cost his job as a Los Angeles Police Officer and left his reputation in tatters. This later prompted him to rejoin the Miami Dade Police Department where he eventually became a CSI. His first reappearance is in the episode \\"Hostile Takeover\\", when he is shown talking to a receptionist. A mentally unstable man then takes him and three others hostage. In the episode's conclusion, Jesse returns to Horatio's team. Horatio welcomes him back and tells him to replace his LAPD badge with the MDPD badge. Death Cardoza is in the crime lab when it is poisoned with Halon gas by serial killer Bob Starling, and dies after he hits and cuts his head during his fall, suffering a subdural hemorrhage. The other team members attempt to revive him without success. Walter is the one most hit by his death and talks to his body about a basketball game they had planned for that night, and about Walter's having called Cardoza's mother, who wants her son to be buried in California; Walter says Horatio is arranging it. Walter also discovered the key to Jesse's death which was his head was stabbed by a piece of glass from the camera of Bob Starling that he was investigating before he was killed, Walter uses this discovery to investigate the memory card full of deleted photos which later got restored once the Crime Lab's servers were back online and the CSIs discover who truly killed Jesse for Starling. Horatio Caine leads the manhunt for Starling all over the city. Starling tries to evade justice goading Caine into killing him via suicide by cop, but Caine will not allow Starling to get off that easy and Caine is able to formally arrest Starling for first degree murder of a police officer and attempted murder of the rest of the team. At the end of the episode, Walter is at the basketball court, shooting baskets when the rest of the CSI team show up and split into teams for a game. Eric passes the ball to Horatio who says, \\"This is for Jesse\\", before making a perfect shot. Personal life While Cardoza hid a lot his private life, it's know he liked women very much. A mileage discrepancy in the vehicle logs from a day when Calleigh lent him her Hummer led her to confront Cardoza about the differences. After a heated discussion, Cardoza then tells Calleigh that he was following a woman who was living with a serial killer he had investigated during his time in LA, who had also killed his supposed wife Tracy. He seemed to felt guilty about her murder.

The High Eifel is the central area from Gerolstein to Adenau, the Schnee Eifel ( or Schnee-Eifel) is the western region from Pr√ºm to Stadtkyll The Schnee Eifel is a heavily wooded landscape in Germany's Central Uplands, up to , that forms part of the western Eifel in the area of the German-Belgian border. The name may have been derived in the 19th century from the Schneifel chain of hills which had nothing to do with snow (Schnee), but with the name for a forest swathe (Schneise).  Geography  The Schnee Eifel natural region is formed by the southern part of the Hohes Venn-Eifel Nature Park. To the north it is bounded by the river Kyll, the border with the North Eifel, that begins near Hallschlag and Kronenburg with the Zitter Forest; To the east the Kyll forms the boundary river with the High Eifel. To the south the Schnee Eifel merges into the South Eifel to Pronsfeld in the Pr√ºmer Land. Its highest elevation is found on the Schneifel ridge: the high Schwarzer Mann (\\"Black Man\\"). The term Schneifel is frequently employed in publications to mean the whole Schnee Eifel region, but they are not synonymous. The Schneifel is actually the uninhabited central chain of hills in the Schnee-Eifel; whose coverage goes beyond the narrow definition of the Schneifel and includes the southern source region of the Kyll and its upper reaches as well as the adjoining Pr√ºm Forest southeast of the main crest. The largest town in the Schnee Eifel is Pr√ºm which lies on the river of the same name. Its well-known ski areas are the Schwarze Mann and the Wolfsschlucht. They lie about northwest and north of Pr√ºm respectively. = Geology = Much of the Eifel belongs to the Rhine Massif. The Schnee Eifel, and in particular, the Schneifel, its highest region, is a truncated upland, the stumps of once great mountains that were formed by Hercynian folding during the Devonian period of geological history. After a long period of severe erosion they were uplifted again in the Quaternary period. Scattered areas of old rock with smooth relief still exist, although at times they are hard to discern. Rougher highlands stand out from this base, especially in the north (Pr√ºmer Land) ], owing to the hardness of their rocks, like the quartzite ridge of the Schneifel. This long, sinewy ridge juts out above the less jagged, old plateau by around 100 metres and is clear evidence of the resistance of the local quartz rock to the forces of weathering. It is remarkable for its length of against an average width of just . With little variation in height, it runs from Brandscheid as far as Ormont near Stadtkyll, where it ends at the Steinberg (654 m). =Fauna= Due to its remote location the Schnee-Eifel is undeveloped, where rare plants and animals may be found, including the wildcat and, for several years now, the Eurasian lynx. Fiction The hamlet of Winterspelt is the setting for the novel of the same name by Alfred Andersch, which takes place in the final months of the Second World War.

The RLV-TD vehicle was launched from the first launchpad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 23 May 2016 at 7:00 AM local time, on board an HS9 rocket booster. After a successful lift that lasted 91.1 seconds to a height of about 56 km, the RLV-TD separated from the 9-ton HS9 booster and further ascended to a height of about 65 km. The RLV-TD then began its descent at about Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound). The vehicle's navigation, guidance and control systems accurately steered the vehicle during this phase for a controlled splashdown down to the defined landing spot over the Bay of Bengal, at a distance of about 450 km from Sriharikota, thereby fulfilling its mission objectives. The vehicle was tracked during its flight from ground stations at Sriharikota and a shipborne terminal. The total flight duration from launch to splashdown lasted about 770 seconds. The unit was not planned to be recovered. ISRO plans to construct an airstrip greater than 4 km long in Sriharikota island in the \\"near future\\".

Thorndike Joseph Jacobs Thorndike (July 29, 1913 ‚Äì November 22, 2005) was an American editor and writer.Richard F. Snow \\"Mister Thorndike,\\" American Heritage, February/March 2006. He was Managing Editor of Life for three years in the late 1940s, and a co-founder of American Heritage and Horizon magazines. Biography Thorndike was born and raised in Peabody, Massachusetts, a small town north of Boston. His father was a stockbroker, his mother a teacher. Thorndike was a straight A student at Peabody High, valedictorian of his class, and a writer for two school magazines. At Harvard ('34) he majored in Economics, but spent much of his time at The Harvard Crimson, rising to Managing Editor his junior year, and to President his senior year. In June 1934, he started work at Time magazine, writing people, miscellany and education articles. He was asked by Henry Luce to join a group planning a new picture magazine, and when Life debuted in 1936, Thorndike, though only 23, was an associate editor of the magazine.. His immediate boss at Life was John Shaw Billings, the first Managing Editor. Billings kept a diary in which, according to Loudon Wainwright's book The Great American Magazine: An Inside History of Life, he called Thorndike \\"a mulish young Yankee,\\" and \\"a stubborn little New England cuss\\".Wainwright, Loudon (1986). The Great American Magazine: An Inside History of Life. New York: Knopf. p. 166; 176. Wainwright himself called Thorndike \\"a handsome, bright, reserved, efficient fellow...ambitious, proud, marked from the start for bigger things.\\"Wainwright, Loudon (1986). The Great American Magazine: An Inside History of Life. New York: Knopf. p. 111. In 1946, as Life's circulation topped five million, Thorndike became the magazine's third Managing Editor, a position he held for three years. Toward the end of his stay, disagreements grew between him and Luce. Life, in late 1948, had published a \\"Life Goes To A Party\\" story about an uninhibited dance party in Hawaii, including photos of scantily-dressed partygoers. Luce's reaction was to subject the Managing Editor to more supervision, which Thorndike resisted. The dispute came to a head in August, 1949, after Luce circulated a memoir proposing an \\"Editor-in- Chief's Committee\\" that would decide on all future articles for the magazine. Thorndike read it, packed his briefcase and resigned. In 1950, Thorndike and another refugee from Life, Oliver Jensen, formed a small publishing company, Picture Press. They put out a book of cowboy photos by Life photographer Leonard McCombe, and a lavish picture book for Ford Motor Company, Ford at Fifty. James Parton, whom Thorndike had known at the Crimson, joined them in 1952 to create Thorndike Jensen & Parton, and in 1954 they took over a small history publication named American Heritage. They enlarged it, turned it into a hardcover, profusely illustrated bimonthly with no advertisements, and hired popular American Civil War historian Bruce Catton as editor and writer. Circulation at American Heritage rose to over 300,000. David McCullough, author of the bestsellers Truman and John Adams, and writer and editor for the magazine, later said that it was \\"the best place I ever worked as an employee... They were receptive to new ideas, with very high editorial standards, high accuracy, and quality writing... You felt like you were cast in a hit show with great people.\\" A second magazine, Horizon, followed in 1958, and over the next three decades the company published dozens of illustrated books on history, art and architecture. Thorndike wrote two of them: The Magnificent Builders And Their Dream Houses (1978), and The Very Rich: A History of Wealth (1985). American Heritage sold to McGraw-Hill in 1970, to private investor Samuel Pryor Reed of New York City in 1976, to Forbes in 1986, and to an independent publisher, Edwin S. Grosvenor, in 2007. In his early seventies, Thorndike served for two years as head of The American Heritage Dictionary Usage Panel, a group of writers and scholars who are polled on acceptable English usage. In 1993 Thorndike published his last book, The Coast: A Journey Down the Atlantic Shore, which Kirkus Reviews described as \\"an effective combination of eyeball observation, rich history, and sad acknowledgment of how poorly we have used still another national resource.\\" Thorndike was married twice: to Virginia Lemont in 1940, with whom he had two sons, John and Alan, and to Margery Darrell in 1964, with whom he had a son, Joe. For twenty-eight years until she died in 2004, Thorndike had a close relationship with his \\"great and good friend\\" Jane Allport. Thorndike died in 2005 of complications from Alzheimer's and congestive heart failure. He is buried in the Island Pond Cemetery in Harwich, Massachusetts.

The constitution was drawn up by the Constituent Assembly that was elected in June 1994. It was adopted by the Transitional Government of Ethiopia in December 1994 and came into force following the general election held in May‚ÄìJune 1995.Country profile: Ethiopia. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (April 2005). The constitution consists of 106 articles in 11 chapters. It provides for a federal government of nine ethnically based regions governed by a parliament divided into the House of Peoples' Representatives and the House of Federation. It provides for a parliamentary system, with a mostly ceremonial President as head of state, and executive power vested in a Council of Ministers headed by a Prime Minister. The constitution expressly provides for a set of basic human rights; Article 13 specifies that these rights and freedoms will be interpreted according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other international instruments adopted by Ethiopia. The document further guarantees that all Ethiopian languages will enjoy equal state recognition, although Amharic is specified as the working language of the federal government. Ethiopia has a tradition of highly personal and strongly centralized government, a pattern the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (the coalition presently in government) has followed despite constitutional limits on federal power. The first general election held after the adoption of the Constitution was the 2000 election. There were three earlier constitutions of Ethiopia, the preceding one being the 1987 Constitution.

History Its creation was agreed to by the city authorities of Oslo in 1925, and the company was inaugurated on 1 January 1926 as Oslo Kinematografer. It was a part of the Norwegian system of municipally-owned cinemas, superseding private ownership in the field. Only the Conservative Party and the Liberal Left Party voted against municipalization. These parties subsequently attempted to privatize cinemas in the years after 1926, but failed.Solum and Asbj√∏rnsen, 2008: p. 31 An important motivation for municipal ownership was the surplus from the budget, which could be used for other cultural budget posts. Oslo Concert Hall, Folketeatret, Gustav Vigeland's atelier (later the Vigeland Museum) and the Munch Museum received monetary support from the cinema fund. In 1997 the company was turned into a joint stock company. Between 2001 and 2003 the city council of Oslo tried to orchestrate a sale of 66% of the company shares, but this did not happen. No bidder came close to the expected prize, and the sale thus fell through.Solum and Asbj√∏rnsen, 2008: p. 31‚Äì33 The name was changed from Oslo Kinematografer to Oslo Kino in 2007. Key people The early directors were Jens Christian Gundersen (1926-1933) and Kristoffer Aamot (1934-1940). During the German occupation of Norway the company had three Nazi collaborators as directors: Gustav Berg-J√¶ger (1940-1942), Einar Schibbye (1942-1944) and Birger Ilseng (1944-1945). Kristoffer Aamot then recovered his job, and sat until 1955. Theodor Rosenquist followed (1955-1958), then Arnljot Engh (1958-1975), Eivind Hjelmtveit (1975-1993), Ingeborg Mor√¶us Hanssen (1993-2005), Cecilie Tr√∏an (acting, 2005-2006) and Geir Bergkastet (2006-present). Pre-war chairs of the board of directors were Arthur Skjeldrup (1926-1928), Kristoffer Aamot (1929-1931), Eyvind Getz (1932-1934) and Rachel Grepp (1935-1940). The chairpersons during the German occupation of Norway are not known. After the war, Rolf Hofmo sat from 1946 to 1955, then Rolf Stranger (1956-1967), Albert Nordengen (1968-1971), Adele Lerche (1972-1975), Turid Dankertsen (1976-1979), Albert Nordengen again (1980-1983), Bj√∏rn Bj√∏rnseth (1984-1987), Jon Lyng (1988-1991), Christian Hambro (1992), Theo Koritzinsky (1993-1995), Jon Lyng again (1996-2003) and Heidi Larssen (2003-present).

He has been described as a \\"legend and part of Dublin mythology\\".LUGS: The Life and Times of Garda Jim Branigan By Bernard Neary: 1995: 5 Early life He was born in No.1 James Street, Dublin, which was part of Saint Kevin's Hospital (South Dublin union) in 1910. He was the son of John Alick Branigan, an official of South Dublin Union, and Ellen Branigan (n√©e Kavanagh). James witnessed the shooting of a British soldier during the 1916 Rising - the area they lived in saw heavy fighting. It is now part of Ushers Quay.Residents of house number 17 in South Dublin Union (Usher's Quay, Dublin), 1911 Census He was educated at Basin Lane Convent and James' Street Christian Brothers School. Career=Railway apprenticeship= Branigan left school at 14 to become an apprentice fitter on Great Southern Railways, where he was bullied. On completing his apprenticeship, he left. =Garda√≠= Branigan joined the Garda√≠ in June 1931 and took up physical exercise after barely passing physical requirements. He was stationed in Kevin Street in 1936 and was known for using physical force against petty criminals, which he admitted to doing to avoid excessive paperwork. Upon joining the police force, Garda Branigan distinguished himself during violent disturbances during the 'wild' forties in Dublin and became well known after a violent riot which subsequently became known as the 'Battle of Baldoyle' where one person died. Branigan sometimes acted as an unofficial social worker, as he was close to people on his beat. He was promoted to detective Garda in July 1958 and Garda sergeant in December 1963 and put in charge of a mobile riot squad unit, which he remained active with until his retirement. He became well known after he took charge of this unit, the so- called Prevention and Detection of Street Nuisances Unit, also known as 'Brano Five Team', who were called out to any trouble spots in Dublin. This unit became well known around the night spots of Dublin, such as dance halls and cinemas, where 'tough justice' was meted out to any transgressors. Branigan, who headed up the unit until its disbandment in 1973, had the respect of both the community and judiciary, the now Sergeant Branigan becoming a well-known figure in Dublin during the 1960s. Stories of mistreatment, rough or tough justice surrounded Garda Branigan and his squad, the sight of his Bedford van, was feared on Dublin's late-night streets. His individual heavy-handedness, strength and fearlessness drew much attention to Sergeant Branigan, his personal notoriety growing over the years. There are also allegations that some young men were beaten up in Garda cars, cells and alleys for little or no reason. He had particularly targeted Teddy Boys. He believed his outspoken personality had been held against him by senior Garda√≠, preventing his further promotion. An oft-repeated story has Detective Branigan giving culprits either the choice of a 'box to the face' or a day in court. Commenting in court after one notorious incident when a criminal bit him on the bottom during an arrest, he referred to the then-current allegations of cannibalism by the Baluba people during the Niemba Ambush in Congo, saying \\"He was worse than the Balubas. At least they cook you first.\\"'Quotes of the Week He was reprimanded by the Garda√≠ for the remark. Reputation Detective Branigan in his day enjoyed the respect of the community, the bench and those he prosecuted and sometimes he was appointed as a bodyguard to visiting celebrities. Since his death, there has been an increased interest and nostalgia about the activities of his squad, with a senior High Court Judge, Mr Justice Paul Carney, claiming in 2009 that the heavy-handed detectives like Garda Branigan were required in today's Dublin to deter crime. Carney said 'Gardai need Lugs Branigan approach to cracking crime said of Detective Branigan: > Nowadays, in more politically correct times, he would probably be abolished > by the Garda Ombudsman Commission, and possibly also prosecuted...Had his > unit, known as Prevention and Detection of Street Nuisances, been continued > rather than disbanded on his retirement, I suspect that the streets of > Dublin would be considerably safer than they are now....I am dealing > primarily with my experiences in trials on indictment, which evolved from a > situation in my early days where there was an attack on Garda behaviour in > virtually every case, to a situation in which there is now virtually no > criticism of garda conduct in my court. > In what I might describe as the bad old days, there were frequent > allegations of verbals being floated in the police car on the way to the > station or on the stairs leading from the cells to the dock...I never hear > such allegations now.'' Senator David Norris, a civil rights campaigner and longtime member of Seanad √âireann (the Irish Senate), said in the senate chamber in 1993 that:'Seanad √âireann - Volume 136 - 5 May 1993 > There is an onus on us to ensure that the guardians of law and order are > protected.

I > am not suggesting that we return to those days but I believe that the > balance has gone too far in the other direction. On 28 January 2009, RT√â Radio 1's Liveline, programme, a popular talk programme, featured callers reminiscing about Detective Branigan and his activities as a Garda in Dublin. In November 2015 he was the subject of a documentary on TG4, in which he was both praised for his work and criticised for excessive violence. The nickname 'Lugs' refers to his prominent ears. A keen boxer, he achieved his nickname 'Lugs' early in life due to his Cauliflower ears, a condition most common among amateur wrestlers, rugby players, mixed martial artists and grapplers, it is said he got the name because of his ears by a Dublin criminal in the 1940s - a nickname he disliked. According to Neary (1985), he was known as Jim, \\"Branno\\" and \\"The Bran\\" to his Garda colleagues. =Boxing= He lived on Drimnagh Road, just off the Crumlin Road in Dublin, and was treasurer of the County Dublin Board of the Irish Amateur Boxing Association (I.A.B.A) and acted as a boxing referee into his late seventies. During the 1930s he was involved with the Garda Boxing Club, fighting at cruiser-weight, light-heavyweight and heavyweight and eventually winning the Leinster heavyweight title. In 1938, he fought for the Ireland international boxing team in Germany. He retired from boxing in 1939, though he became a referee. He sparred with younger boxers and weight-trained well into his sixties. Retirement Branigan retired on 6 January 1973. He received many tributes, but was particularly touched by a canteen of cutlery and Waterford glass set from some Dublin prostitutes, who regarded him as a father figure. He had requested to stay on in the Garda√≠ for two years, but the request was denied. He spent most of his retirement in Summerhill, County Meath, breeding budgerigars and growing crops. He died there on 22 May 1986. Further reading=Non-fiction= *Neary, B. (1985). Lugs: The Life and Times of Jim Branigan. Dublin: Lenhar Publications. *McNiffe, L. (1997).

Joule Unlimited, formerly known as Joule Biotechnologies, was a producer of alternative energy technologies based in Bedford, Massachusetts. The company developed a process to generate hydrocarbon-based fuel by combining non-fresh water, nutrients, cyanobacteria, carbon dioxide, and sunlight. After ten years of operation and building a demonstration plant in New Mexico, the company shut down in August 2017. The company shut down after management was unable to raise money. Technology claims The company claimed it would be able to produce more than 20,000 gallons of fuel per acre per year (19,000 m3/km2/annum) in almost refined form using carbon dioxide waste from industrial processes and desert land. Helioculture uses photosynthetic organisms, but is otherwise distinct from the process that makes fuel from algae. Oils made from algae usually have to be refined into fuel following a batch process, but helioculture secretes fuel directly rather than storing it in their cells - either ethanol or hydrocarbons - that do not need refining.

It is a weighted sum for which the weight value is 1 for a single, 2 for a double, 3 for a triple and 4 for a home run. For example, three singles is three total bases, a double and a home run is six total bases, and three triples is nine total bases. Only bases attained from hits count toward this total. Reaching base by other means (such as a base on balls) or advancing further after the hit (such as when a subsequent batter gets a hit) does not increase the player's total bases. In box scores and other statistical summaries, total bases is often denoted by the abbreviation TB. The total bases divided by the number of at bats is the player's slugging percentage. Records Hank Aaron's 6,856 career total bases make him the all-time MLB record holder. Having spent the majority of his career playing in the National League, he also holds that league's record with 6,591 total bases. Aaron hit for 300 or more total bases in a record 15 different seasons. Ty Cobb's 5,854 total bases constitute the American League record. Albert Pujols is the active leader and fifth all-time, with 5,863 TB through the 2019 MLB season. The single season MLB and American League records are held by Babe Ruth, who hit for 457 TB in the 1921 season. The following season saw Rogers Hornsby set the National League record when he hit for 450 total bases. Shawn Green holds the single game total bases record of 19 TB. Green hit four home runs, a single and a double for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Milwaukee Brewers on May 23, 2002. The equivalent American League record is held by Josh Hamilton, who hit four home runs and a double (18 TB) for the Texas Rangers in a May 8, 2012, game versus the Baltimore Orioles. Dustin Pedroia collected the most total bases in a single interleague game during the regular season, with 15. Pedroia hit three home runs, a single and a double for the Boston Red Sox on June 24, 2010, in a game against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field. The 2003 Boston Red Sox hit for 2,832 total bases in the American League; the National League team record for a single season is held by the 2001 Colorado Rockies (2,748 TB). The Red Sox also have the record for most total bases by a team in one game: they hit for 60 TB in a 29‚Äì4 victory over the St. Louis Browns on June 8, 1950. Among major league pitchers, Phil Niekro gave up the most total bases in a career (7,473), while Robin Roberts (555 TB allowed in 1956) holds the single season record. The record number of total bases allowed in a single game by one pitcher is 42, by Allan Travers of the Detroit Tigers. =Postseason= Two players have hit for 14 total bases in a postseason game. Albert Pujols is the only player to accomplish this in the World Series, doing so for the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 3 of the 2011 World Series, when he had two singles and three home runs. Bob Robertson also achieved the feat while playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates in Game 2 of the 1971 National League Championship Series, with a double and three home runs. David Freese holds the record for a single postseason, with 50 total bases during the 2011 playoffs for the St. Louis Cardinals, while Derek Jeter has the career postseason record of 302 total bases, all with the New York Yankees. The Boston Red Sox hit for 45 total bases in their 23‚Äì7 victory over the Cleveland Indians in Game 4 of the 1999 American League Division Series, a postseason record. The most total bases by a team in a World Series game is 34, by the Atlanta Braves in Game 5 of the 1991 World Series, when they beat the Minnesota Twins by a score of 14‚Äì5. =All-Star Games= Ted Williams hit for a record 10 total bases (two singles and two home runs) in the All-Star Game when representing the American League in the 1946 edition. The 1954 edition, when the American League had 29 and the National League had 23, produced the most total bases in a single All-Star Game, 52. The most total bases by one team in an All-Star Game is 29, achieved by the American League in both the 1954 and 1992 editions. The National League had a high of 25 total bases in the 1951 game.

View is looking from west to east. Blum Stadium was the home of Parsons College (Fairfield, Iowa) Wildcats football from 1966 through their final season in 1970. The dedication game was a 37‚Äì7 victory over Los Angeles State on October 8, 1966. The final game was a 10‚Äì8 victory over Wayne State (Mich.) on October 24, 1970. Parsons overall record at Blum Stadium was 17‚Äì9. In previous years, Parsons had played on campus at Alumni Field. Alumni Field was re-dedicated as Johnson Field in 1947, in honor of the faculty member who led the effort to create the playing field facility in the early 1900s. This small venue was razed in the late 1950s to make room for Fry-Thomas Fieldhouse. This location is directly south of the Blum Stadium site, in the southeast corner of the campus. From the late 1950s up to 1966, Parsons played their home games at Fairfield High School's stadium, which is located in the eastern section of Fairfield, just north of US Route 34. Blum Stadium consisted of concrete seating placed along both sides of the field from back-of-endzone to back-of- endzone. The seating was built into an earthen horseshoe that transitioned from being excavated at the northern end to build up embankment on the southern end. The wooden pressbox was located on the western side of the stadium. The scoreboard stood atop the earthen ridge on the north end of the stadium. Two pre-fab sheet metal dressing rooms were located side by side at the south end of the stadium. According to newspaper accounts of the time, one week before the dedication game, the stadium consisted of the sodded playing field, and the earthen horseshoe. The concrete foundations for the seating had been constructed, but no seats were in place. In the week leading up to the dedication game, the pre-cast concrete seating/walkway sections were trucked in, set into place, and wooden bench seats were bolted onto them. The wooden pressbox was built in the few days before the game. Also, the dressing rooms, scoreboard, goalposts and a chain link fence around the stadium were installed during this week. Carpenters were still working on the pressbox within 40 minutes of the 1:30 pm kickoff, and sod was being placed at the same time. In the 1967 (1966‚Äì67 schoolyear) Parsons yearbook (The Peira), the description of the dedication game refers to \\"Instant Blum Stadium.\\" After acquiring the Parsons campus in 1974, the Maharishi University of Management used the site as a soccer field/stadium up into the early 2000s, when it was demolished as a part of their program of transforming the campus along Maharishi Sthapatya Veda principles of architecture. The concrete seats and much of their embankment were removed to \\"smooth out\\" the earthen bowl. The playing field remains.

History It was first opened in 1957 as two separate schools with the titles West Wythenshawe Technical High School for Girls and West Wythenshawe Technical High School for Boys. There were sports fields, tennis courts, science labs, library. A statue which was commissioned by Mitzi Cunliffe, who designed the Bafta, was erected outside the boys gymnasium. In 1968, the two schools joined together as a comprehensive to be known as Brookway High School, and the classes became mixed. In 2003, the school was then given the title of a Sports College, and was renamed \\"Brookway High School & Sports College\\". Following the school's re title, a three million pound facility was built on the site, the interior included; two sports halls, three classrooms, and one large gym. This new facility is used by both the school and the community. In March 2020, due to the coronavirus outbreak, the school, along with all of the schools in the United Kingdom and abroad, was shut until further notice, leaving students into home learning. Closure and rebuild Manchester City Council invested almost ¬£200 million into a project which would improve the schools in the Manchester area. The original Brookway High School & Sports College/Manchester Health Academy building was demolished entirely, along with other local schools such as St Paul's RC High School, Newall Green High School and Parklands High School due to issues that could not be solved, or would have cost more, with a renovation. Work started on new ¬£20 million building for Manchester Health Academy in March 2009, and was completed in September 2010. The old building was demolished in March 2011, and the space was used as part of the Manchester Metrolink tram line, which was completed in 2016. In July 2008, Barry Burke, the headteacher at Rhyddings Business and Enterprise School in Oswaldtwistle, was appointed Principal of Manchester Health Academy. He took up his post in January 2009. In August 2013, he retired from his position, being succeeded by Damien Owen. Facilities The Academy was built with less traditional teaching methods in mind. It features three large Learning Zones, each of which can be used to teach up to four classes per zone and two smaller Learning Zones, each of which can be used to teach up to two classes per zone. Also eight traditional style classrooms for practical subjects such as science, design, technology, cooking, music, ICT, drama, art and dance. The school states that the learning zones are large enough accommodate 150 students per year group at one time, meaning a theoretical maximum student count of 750 plus 150 maximum for the sixth form centre. The Academy also uses cashless catering services in order to purchase items from the canteen. It is believed that this saves time and reduces queuing time by 20% The Academy features a public library which is operated by Manchester Library & Information Service, it is situated to the front of the building, in an separate enclosed space which prevents un authorised members of the public gaining access to the school, or the sixth form centre. Situated also on site is the Sixth Form centre which is located on the top floor and is separated from the school. The sixth form centre also uses the Learning Zones and has a total of three in the contained space. The centre is operated in partnership with The Manchester College, and currently offers courses in Business, Health and Social Care, Sport, IT, Forensic Science and Early Years Education and Care to High School leavers. In 2016, Manchester City Council approached the school, inviting it to expand its student population. The ¬£10 million transformation programme of the school's estate has seen the addition of a new dining room extension, multi use games area and FA standard all-weather pitch, while the new Maths and English building fully opened weeks later. Supporting the school's commitment to improve standards in Maths and English, the new building's classrooms house cutting edge technology, improved acoustics and energy saving lighting. It will also feature a new glass atrium, providing a welcoming entrance and flexible space for both the academy and community. Former player for Manchester United, Denis Irwin officially opened the school's new all weather pitch in November 2017. The new floodlit playing surface, which can be used all year round, complements the school's existing sports facilities, which see over a thousand people play each week during the season.

Life He was born in Hosier Lane, near West Smithfield, London, where his father was a mathematical instrument maker. The family originally came from Sibsey, near Boston, Lincolnshire, from where Hilkiah's grandfather, a quaker, moved to London and settled there as a stationer in the seventeenth century. He was educated at Bradley, Suffolk, and in 1679 proceeded to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he was elected as the first scholar on the foundation of his maternal grandfather, William Plat. He was elected fellow of St. John's, and having received holy orders was instituted to the rectory of Wittering. At the Glorious Revolution he refused to take the oaths to the new monarchs, and was ejected from his living. He then kept a successful boarding house at Westminster for the scholars of Westminster School. He became chaplain to Dr. Thomas Ken, the deprived bishop of Bath and Wells, and began to write. He made a translation of An Answer to Fontenelle's History of Oracles, edited Peter Barwick's Vita Joannis Barwick, and translated it with notes. He published in 1710 a Vindication of the Church of England, and also an Essay on the Thirty- nine Articles. The book which made Hilkiah Bedford famous was one which he did not write. In 1713 a folio volume was published anonymously, entitled The Hereditary Right of the Crown of England asserted, in an answer to William Higden, who had been a nonjuror, but recanted, and defended his recantation in a work entitled A View of the English Constitution. Bedford was suspected of having written the Hereditary Right, and was found guilty of writing, printing, and publishing it. He was fined 1,000 marks and imprisoned for three years, and after the expiration of the period was to find sureties for his good behaviour during life. He was also condemned to appear before the court with a paper on his hat confessing the crime; but this part of the sentence was remitted in consideration of his being a clergyman. The real author was George Harbin, also a nonjuror; it is said that Hilkiah Bedford knew this, but preferred to suffer unjustly rather than betray Harbin. Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth sent Harbin to Bedford with ¬£100, not knowing that Harbin (his chaplain) was responsible for the book. Hilkiah Bedford became a bishop among the nonjurors; he left a son Thomas Bedford.

Tephra layers in a quarry near Weibern in the Brohl Valley The Volcanic Eifel or Vulkan Eifel () is a region in the Eifel Mountains in Germany that is defined to a large extent by its volcanic geological history. Characteristic of this volcanic field are its typical explosion crater lakes or maars, and numerous other signs of volcanic activity such as volcanic tuffs, lava streams and volcanic craters like the Laacher See. The Volcanic Eifel is still volcanically active today. One sign of this activity is the escaping gases in the Laacher See.  Geographical location  The Wingertsbergwand gives an idea of the amount of volcanic ash ejected during the outbreak of the Laacher See - volcano. The Volcanic Eifel stretches from the Rhine to the Wittlich Depression. It is bordered in the south and southwest by the South Eifel, in the west by Luxembourg and Belgian Ardennes and in the north by the North Eifel including the Hohes Venn. To the east the Rhine forms its geographical boundary, with no volcanicity immediately beyond it. The Volcanic Eifel is divided into three natural regions: * Volcanic West Eifel (Manderscheid, Daun, Gerolstein, Obere Kyll, Hillesheim (within the parish of Nohn), * Volcanic High Eifel (Adenau, Kelberg, Ulmen and Nohn), * Volcanic East Eifel (Brohltal, Vordereifel, Mendig, Pellenz) The centre of the Volcanic Eifel is the region around Daun and Manderscheid and the areas within the Mayen-Koblenz district. The landscape of the Volcanic Eifel is dominated by recent volcanism. Volcanic craters, thick pumice and basalt layers and maars create a diverse landscape that clearly witnesses to very recent events in geological terms.

the third constitution of Ethiopia, and went into effect on 22 February 1987 after a referendum on 1 February of that year. Its adoption inaugurated the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE). Contents The document consisted of seventeen chapters and 119 articles. The preamble traced Ethiopia's origins back to antiquity, proclaimed the historical heroism of its people, praised the country's substantial natural and human resources, and pledged to continue the struggle against imperialism, poverty, and hunger. The government's primary concern was proclaimed to be the country's development through the implementation of the Program for the National Democratic Revolution, which Kasahun Ankosa had proclaimed in a speech 20 April 1976. In the process, it was assumed that the material and technical bases necessary for establishing socialism would be created. The constitution attempted to situate Ethiopia in the context of the worldwide movement of \\"progressive states\\" and made no direct reference to Africa. Critics claim that the constitution was no more than an abridged version of the 1977 Soviet constitution, with the exception of the sweeping powers vested in the presidency. A second difference between the Ethiopian and Soviet constitutions is that the former declared the country to be a unitary state rather than a federation. It was reported that the problem of nationalities was hotly debated in the Constitutional Commission, as well as in the WPE Central Committee, but the regime would not abandon its desire to create a single multiethnic state rather than a federation. The 835-member legislature, the National Shengo, was defined as the highest organ of state power. Its members were elected to five-year terms. Executive power was vested in a president, elected by the National Shengo for a five-year term, and a cabinet also appointed by the Shengo. The president was chairman of the Council of State, which acted for the legislature between sessions. Actual power, however, rested in the Workers' Party of Ethiopia, defined as the leading force of state and society. More specifically, actual power rested with Mengistu, who was not only president of the country but general secretary of the WPE. He and the other surviving members of the Derg dominated the WPE's Politburo. In essence, the power structure set up by the constitution was a carbon copy of the power structure in other communist countries. The party was granted even more power than the government, which acted more or less as a transmission belt for the party. As was the case with other Communist legislatures, the National Shengo was nominally vested with great lawmaking powers, but actually did little more than rubber-stamp decisions already made by the WPE and its Politburo. The Constitution guaranteed all manner of civil rights and personal freedoms, such as freedom of speech, the press, religion, movement, assembly, and association. Citizens also had the right to a fair trial and a free education. In practice, as in all Communist regimes, the government paid almost no attention to these freedoms. As had been the case during the Derg era, Ethiopia ranked at or near the bottom of most measures of human rights and civil liberties. Drafting The primary task facing the Workers' Party of Ethiopia (WPE) following its formation in 1984 was to devise the new national constitution that would inaugurate the PDRE. In March 1986, a 343-member Constitutional Commission was formed to draft a new constitution based on the principles of scientific socialism. Eventually, the 122 full and alternate members of the WPE Central Committee who had been appointed to its membership dominated the commission. The Constitutional Commission had its origins in the Institute for the Study of Ethiopian Nationalities, which the Provisional Military Administrative Council (better known as the Derg) had established March 1983 to find solutions to problems resulting from Ethiopia's vast ethnic diversity. The Institute was staffed mostly by academics from Addis Ababa University, who continued to serve as advisers to the Constitutional Commission. The commission's diverse membership included religious leaders, artists, writers, doctors, academics, athletes, workers, and former nobility. There was also an attempt by those who chose appointees to the commission to make sure that all major ethnic nationalities had representation in the body. For about six months, the commission debated the details of the new constitution. In June 1986, it issued a 120-article draft document. The government printed and distributed 1 million copies to kebeles and peasant associations throughout the country. During the next two months, the draft was discussed at about 25,000 locations. The regime used this method of discussion to legitimize the constitution-making process and to test the mood of the populace. In some cases, people attended constitutional discussion sessions only after pressure from local WPE cadres, but in other cases attendance was voluntary. Where popular interest was apparent, it centered on issues such as taxes, the role of religion, marriage, the organization of elections, and citizenship rights and obligations. By far the most controversial draft provision was the one that outlawed polygamy, which caused a furor among Muslims. Few questions were raised about the document's failure to address the nationalities problem and the right to self-determination. According to government officials, the citizenry submitted more than 500,000 suggested revisions. In August the commission reconvened to consider proposed amendments. In all, the commission accepted ninety-five amendments to the original draft, most of which, however, were cosmetic. Referendum The national referendum on the constitution was held on 1 February 1987, and Mengistu announced the results three weeks later. He reported that 96 percent of the 14 million people eligible to participate (adults eighteen years of age and older) actually voted. Eighty-one percent of the electorate endorsed the constitution, while 18 percent opposed it (1 percent of the ballots were invalid). Although this was the first election in Ethiopia's history based on universal suffrage, the presence of WPE cadres throughout the country ensured that the constitution would be adopted. In Tigray and Eritrea, however, the regime held referendums only in urban centers because much of these territories was controlled by the Tigray People's Liberation Front and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, respectively. In other places, such as parts of Welo and Gondar regions, the vote took place amid heightened security measures. Although the constitution officially took effect on the same day the PDRE was proclaimed 22 February 1987, it was not until that September the new government was fully in place and the Derg formally abolished.

While CEO of Bank of America, Lewis was noted for purchasing Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch resulting in large losses for the bank and necessitating financial assistance from the federal government. On September 30, 2009 Bank of America confirmed that Lewis would be retiring by the end of the year. Lewis was replaced by Brian Moynihan as president and CEO and Walter Massey as chairman of the board. Early life and career Lewis grew up in Walnut Grove, Mississippi until age 5, then moved to Heidelberg, Germany. His father was in the Army. He is a graduate of Georgia State University, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in finance from J. Mack Robinson College of Business. Lewis joined North Carolina National Bank (NCNB) as a credit analyst in 1969, and served as the head of both international and domestic operations when it became NationsBank, which would eventually become Bank of America. Chief Executive Officer Lewis became CEO, president and chairman of Bank of America after the retirement of Hugh McColl in 2001. In November 2008, while still CEO of Bank of America, a time when BoA had had to borrow $86 billion from the Fed, Lewis wrote to shareholders saying that he was at the helm of \\"one of the strongest and most stable banks in the world\\".The Federal Reserve's 'breathtaking' $7.7 trillion bank bailout, The Week, NOVEMBER 28, 2011 =Recognition= Lewis was named Banker of the Year in 2001, and was the same year honored as Top Chief Executive Officer, according to US Banker. In 2007, Lewis was listed among the 100 Most Influential People in the world by Time Magazine. He was again named Banker of the Year in 2008. =Salary= While CEO of Bank of America in 2007, Lewis earned total compensation of $20,404,009, which included an annual base salary of $1,500,000, a cash bonus of $4,250,000, stocks granted of $11,065,798, and options granted of $3,376,000.2007 CEO Compensation for Kenneth D.

Lewis , Equilar To avoid a confrontation with Kenneth Feinberg, the U.S. Treasury's special master for compensation, Lewis decided to forgo a salary and bonus in 2009. Lewis has taken home $148.8 million from cash and stock sales since taking over the bank in 2001, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm. Lewis left Bank of America with more than $135 million in retirement benefits, including the pension and $10 million in life insurance benefits, according to an analysis of corporate filings by James F. Reda & Associates, an independent consulting firm.\\"Lewis Won‚Äôt Get Salary at BofA\\" by Louise Story and Eric Dash, The New York Times, October 15, 2009. Retrieved 10/15/09. =Acquisition of Countrywide= On January 11, 2008, Lewis declared that Bank of America would buy Countrywide Financial for $4 billion, stating that it was \\"rare opportunity\\" for the company. Bank of America would eventually settle the acquisition for $2.5 billion. The acquisition has since been characterized as \\"the worst deal in the history of American finance\\" with a total cost which may exceed $40 billion due to Countrywide's real-estate losses, legal expenses and settlements with state and federal agencies. Losses related to the Countrywide acquisition have been so extensive that Bank of America had considered the option of placing its Countrywide division into bankruptcy in 2011. =Engineered takeover of Merrill Lynch= During the financial crisis of 2008, Lewis engineered the takeover of Merrill Lynch for $50 billion. The FDIC chairperson at the time, Sheila Bair, stated that the acquisition was overpriced, as Merrill Lynch along with Countrywide, which Bank of America also acquired, were \\"two of the sickest financial institutions in the country.\\" Bair would further state that Bank of America had been healthy going into the financial crisis but would now be burdened by these ill-timed and overly generous acquisitions. In its January 16, 2009 earnings release, Bank of America revealed massive losses at Merrill Lynch in the fourth quarter, which required an infusion of $20 billion from the federal government. Merrill recorded an operating loss of $21.5 billion in the quarter. On September 28, 2012, Bank of America announced that it agreed to pay $2.4 billion to settle an investor lawsuit over its Merrill Lynch acquisition. =Shareholder reorganization= On April 29, 2009, driven by anger over the Merrill Lynch acquisition, Bank of America shareholders narrowly voted to separate the positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO, effectively removing CEO Lewis from his position as Chairman, though he remained both the bank's president and its CEO.Ken Lewis Ousted As Bank Of America Chairman, Huffington Post One- third of shareholders voted to remove Lewis from the board altogether.Bank of America Chief Ousted as Chairman, New York Times =Retirement= On September 30, 2009, Lewis announced his retirement from Bank of America effective as of December 31, 2009. Lewis released the statement \\"The Merrill Lynch and Countrywide integrations are on track and returning value already. Our board of directors and our senior management include more talent, and more diversity of talent, than at any time in this company's history. We are in position to begin to repay the federal government's TARP investments. For these reasons, I decided now is the time to begin to transition to the next generation of leadership at Bank of America.\\"Ken Lewis Announces His Retirement, Nasdaq Analysts cited the Countrywide acquisition further exacerbated by the Merrill Lynch acquisition, large credit losses at the bank's core operations, and the investment banking industry where Lewis was a novice as reasons why Lewis stepped down. Lewis' full pension benefits totaled $53 million. Critics of the financial sector's salary scale have cited this sum as indicative of poor oversight by the board of directors and as an example of inflated executive compensation. As Lewis' pension plan dated back more than seven years, Lewis was entitled to full benefits. Bank of America has since put a freeze on supplemental executive retirement plans, citing the need to better align executive compensation with investor returns. =Legacy= Bank of America has faced heavy losses from the Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch acquisitions made during Lewis' tenure. Following Lewis' retirement, Bank of America has divested more than $60 billion of assets to increase capital levels, settled with Fannie Mae for $11.7 billion to end disputes on bad home loans related to the Countrywide acquisition, settled for $2.4 billion on an investor lawsuit related to the Merrill Lynch acquisition, joined an $8.5 billion industry accord to compensate for abusive foreclosures, and has accrued nearly $50 billion in costs since 2007 for refunds and litigation related to defective Countrywide home loans and improper foreclosures. In 2011, Lewis's successor, Brian Moynihan, stated Bank of America will sell parts of the business to fill the crater that the Countrywide Financial acquisition left on its balance sheet. Moyhnihan has publicly criticized the acquisitions made under the leadership of Lewis stating \\"the Lewis-era binge left BofA with all kinds of pointless overhead\\" and further stated his intent to unwind many of these acquisitions. Lewis has been named in several lawsuits since his retirement from Bank of America including a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo for defrauding investors and the government when buying Merrill Lynch. On March 2014, Lewis was banned for three years from serving as a public company official and ordered to pay $10 million for failing to disclose Merrill Lynch losses of $9 billion to investors prior to the takeover. Other roles Lewis is a member of the Financial Services Roundtable and the Financial Services Forum; the Fifth District‚Äôs representative on the Federal Advisory Committee; a member of the board and the executive committee and past chairman of United Way of Central Carolinas, Inc.; a member of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy; a director of the Homeownership Education and Counseling Institute; vice chairman of the Corporate Fund Board of The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts; and past chairman of the National Urban League.

In 1932 Beatrix Havergal founded Waterperry School of Horticulture, a residential horticultural college for women. When she retired as principal in 1971, Waterperry School of Horticulture closed, though there remain gardens and a nursery there.'Waterperry Gardens, Oxfordshire', in Julia Brittain, Plants, People, and Places, 2006. Early life Grace Beatrix Helen HavergalOxford Dictionary of National Biography was born at Roydon Manor House in 1901, the second of three children born to the Revd. Clement Havergal (1854-1941) and his wife Eveline. She was also the great-niece of composer Frances Ridley Havergal. The children had a peaceful upbringing despite the fact that their parents' relationship was often strained. In 1902, the family moved to Inkberrow near Redditch, then to Paris where the Rev. Mr. Havergal was assistant chaplain to the British embassy for two years. Then, after a brief period spent at Bagthorpe in , he became rector of Brent Eleigh in Norfolk. Havergal, together with her elder sister Frances, attended St Katherine's boarding school in Walmer after 1912, but after her parents divorced in 1914, she and her siblings moved with their mother to Bedford, where they lived at number 13 Sidney Road, and the children attended Bedford High School. Havergal began working in horticulture after leaving school in 1916, taking on local gardening jobs under the auspices of the Women's War Agricultural Committee. Soon after, her father rejoined the family, and their finances improved sufficiently to allow Havergal to consider training. She ultimately chose to pursue horticulture over music. She subsequently attended the Thatcham Fruit and Flower Farm near Newbury, wherefrom she graduated in 1920, obtaining the Royal Horticultural Society's certificate with honours. Her first challenge was to design and create a garden at Cold Ash, where the high quality of her work brought her to the attention of Miss Willis, the headmistress of the nearby Downe House boarding school. Willis invited Havergal to become the school's head gardener, an offer which she accepted. She created six tennis courts at Downe House, which later became known as the Havergal Courts. Havergal was inspired by Willis to gravitate towards education. Whilst at Downe House, she met the school's housetaker, Avice Sanders, with whom she would remain partnered for the rest of the latter's life. In 1927, they moved to a cottage in the grounds of Pusey House, Oxfordshire and first began to teach students. With less than ¬£250 at the outset, the school supplemented its income by growing produce, which was sold at Swindon Market. The courses combined theory and practical instruction with high standards of efficiency. This training (radically new at the time), ensured that Havergal's reputation grew substantially. After Beatrix‚Äôs death Roald Dahl wrote to Quentin Blake describing how Blake‚Äôs drawing of the character of Miss Trunchball from his children‚Äôs novel ‚ÄòMatilda‚Äô should be based on Havergal‚Äôs stature and dress sense. A copy of this letter is held at the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. The photo Dahl was describing is also there, having been found in his filling cabinet in his writing shed. Dahl and Havergal are likely to have known one another due to their love of horticulture. Waterperry In 1932, the school moved to Waterperry House, a small manor house in Waterperry, Oxfordshire, which originally was rented from Magdalene College. Havergal and Sanders purchased it in 1948. All students paid their own fees until 1958, when scholarships were granted by some county councils following recognition by the Board of Education. Havergal's diploma was accepted by the Institute of Parks Administration as one equal to those issued by Kew and Edinburgh. In 1962, it became an appropriate qualification for associate membership of the institute. Havergal was awarded an MBE in 1960 and the Royal Horticultural Society Veitch Memorial Medal and Victoria Medal of Honour in 1965. For many years Havergal won gold medal for her exhibit of Royal Sovereign strawberries at Chelsea Flower Show. Later life and retirement Avice Sanders died in 1970. In 1971, with her health waning, Havergal sold the estate, leading to the closure of the school. She lived from then on in a cottage in the grounds. She died at Tower House, Woolton Hill, in 1980, whilst visiting her brother. She was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's Church in Waterperry on 14 April.

This constitution was prompted, like its 1931 predecessor, by a concern with international opinion. Such opinion was particularly important at a time when some neighboring African states were rapidly advancing under European colonial tutelage and Ethiopia was pressing its claims internationally for the incorporation of Eritrea, where an elected parliament and more modern administration had existed since 1952. This constitution was suspended by the Derg in their Proclamation No. 1, which was broadcast 15 September 1974, three days after Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed.Rene LaFort, Ethiopia: An Heretical Revolution? translated by A.M. Berrett (London: Zed Press, 1983), p. 70  Overview  The new constitution consisted of eight chapters and 131 articles.Keller, Edmond J. Revolutionary Ethiopia: From Empire to People's Republic (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1988), pp. 84f This document was drawn up by three American advisors‚ÄîA.H. Garretson, John Spencer, and Edgar Burlington‚Äîwho worked with two leading figures of the restored monarchy, Wolde Giyorgis Wolde Yohannes and Aklilu Habte-Wold. After each session the two Ethiopian officials would then report to the Crown Council; according to Spencer, \\"In many instances, the Crown Council, dominated by the extreme conservative, Ras Kassa, would veto our proposals and we would then seek some compromise formula. Progress was extremely slow.\\"Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984), p. 256 While clearly \\"not a mirror image\\" of the U.S. Constitution, Edmond Keller notes it contained a number of ideas from that document, such as a separation of powers between three branches of government, and careful attention given to detailing the \\"Rights and Duties of the People\\", to which 28 articles were devoted. Despite this element, in his memoirs John Spencer lamented that the Crown Council forced the constitution's authors to stress the prerogatives of the crown, giving the emperor the right to rule by emergency decree, to appoint and dismiss ministers without input from the Ethiopian parliament, and to appoint members of the Senate, judges, and even the mayors of municipalities. Spencer also regretted that many of the rights were enjoyed \\"subject to the law\\"!Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay, pp. 257f Bahru Zewde stresses the nature of these executive powers in his discussion of this document, noting that it was \\"a legal charter for the consolidation of absolutism.\\" Bahru quotes the relevant section from Article 4 of the Constitution: \\"By virtue of His Imperial Blood, as well as by the anointing which he has received, the person of the Emperor is sacred, His dignity is inviolable and His power indisputable.\\"Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia, second ed. (Oxford: James Currey, 2001), p. 206 Despite this strengthening of the Emperor's position, the purview of the bicameral Ethiopian parliament was expanded over the 1931 constitution. Although the Senate remained appointive, the Chamber of Deputies was elected. In contrast to the legislature under the 1931 Constitution which could only discuss matters referred to it, it now had the authority to propose laws and veto laws proposed by the executive. It could also summon ministers for questioning, and in extraordinary circumstances it could initiate impeachment proceedings against them. Keller believes its most significant new power was its budgetary function: parliament now had the responsibility of approving or rejecting all proposed budgets, including taxes and allocations.Keller, Revolutionary Ethiopia, p. 87 However, in John Turner's opinion, the absence of a census, the near total illiteracy of the population, and the domination of the countryside by the nobility meant that the majority of candidates who sought election in 1957 were in effect chosen by the elite. The Chamber of Deputies was not altogether a rubber stamp, at times discussing bills and questioning state ministers.

It is located outside Frogner Park, which includes the Vigeland installation with sculptures by Gustav Vigeland. The museum is part of Oslo municipality's cultural department. The museum is dedicated to Norway's most famous sculptor, Gustav Vigeland (1869‚Äì1943). The museum is Vigeland's former studio and residence. His urn and ashes are located in the tower of the museum. He designed his own bronze urn and burial monument, located above his apartment on the 2nd floor. The official web site for the museum is: https://vigeland.museum.no/en . The Vigeland Museum celebrated Gustav Vigeland's 150th Year Anniversary in 2019. Until 2020 the museum used the spelling Vigeland-museet in Norwegian; the spelling was changed to Vigelandmuseet after a long period where people often spelled it Vigelandsmuseet (with s).  Exhibitions  Today, the museum shows a permanent exhibition presenting Vigeland's art and life, and temporary exhibitions with contemporary or historical three-dimensional art. The Vigeland Museum announces tours in the apartment on their web page. Tickets must be pre-booked.  How to get there?  The museum's address is Nobels gate (street) 32, just nearby the Frogner Park. The tram- and bus station Frogner Plass is actually closer to the Vigeland Museum than the station Frogner Park. The Vigeland Museum is a short walk from the Frogner Park. Immediately north of the museum is the more famous Vigeland Sculpture Park-- which showcases Vigeland's larger statues and sculptures--and the Frogner Park. The highway Ring 2 runs nearby, and buses as well as Oslo Tramway provide for public transportation. The museum is within reasonable walking distance of the stations Frogner plass on the Frogner Line, and, further away, Nobels gate on the Sk√∏yen Line (the now-closed station Halvdan Svartes gate was proximate as well).  The building  The building, which is one of Norway's foremost examples of neoclassical architecture, is designed by architect Lorentz Ree. Its history began in 1919, when sculptor Gustav Vigeland made an offer to Oslo Municipality to donate his works sometime in the future. Vigeland's total body of works consisted not only of sculptures, but also woodcuts, drawings, sketches and photographs as well as letters, other writings and a personal library. When a part of the city of Oslo where Gustav Vigeland lived and had his atelier was demolished due to city planning, an agreement between the artist and the City of Oslo came to be: Vigeland wanted an atelier. The atelier could be rebuilt as a museum after his death. Even Vigeland's flat on the third floor was preserved as a part of the museum. The building of the would-be museum commenced in 1921, as soon as a contract between Vigeland and Oslo had been formalized. The architects were Lorentz Harboe Ree and Carl Buch, and the style was neo-classic. In 1923, Vigeland moved in, one year before the middle part and northern wing were completed. The southern wing was completed in 1930. The atelier was used by both Vigeland and other artists. Vigeland died in 1943, during the hard economic times of World War II. The building was open as a public museum in 1947, but the official opening was June 4, 1950. The opening was partially thanks to budget surplus from the municipal cinema company Oslo Kinematografer. The museum is still owned by Oslo municipality via its etat of culture, and the current Museum Director is Jarle Str√∏modden.

It was promulgated in \\"an impressive ceremony\\" held 16 July 1931 in the presence of Emperor Haile Selassie, who had long desired to proclaim one for his country.Harold G. Marcus, Haile Sellassie I: The Formative Years (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1996), pp. 116f In the preface to his translation of this constitution into English, William Stern writes, \\"It is worthy of note that this was the first instance in history where an absolute ruler had sought voluntarily to share sovereign power with the subjects of his realm.\\"Stern, The Ethiopian Constitution (Washington: Ethiopian Research Council, 1936). Besides Stern's pamphlet, an English translation of this document can be found in Margary Perham, The Government of Ethiopia, second edition (London: Faber and Faber, 1969), pp. 423‚Äì432 This statement, however, is not completely truthful, as the adoption of a constitution was somewhat pressed by international opinion. In virtue of this constitution, Ethiopia, one of the last absolute monarchies still existing, began the process of constitutionalization of imperial institutions, grounding the Emperor's authority on more solid basis, but also allowing some initial forms of limitation and participation; this evolutive process would continue after World War II with a new constitution.  Origins and creation  According to his own autobiography, while still Regent Haile Selassie had wanted Empress Zawditu to proclaim such a document, but \\"some of the great nobles, to whose advantage it was to rule the country without a constitution, had pretended that it would diminish the dignity and authority of Queen Zawditu if a constitution were set up.\\"Haile Selassie, My Life and Ethiopia's Progress: The Autobiography of Emperor Haile Sellassie I, translated by Edward Ullendorff (Chicago: Frontline Distribution, 1999), vol. 1 p. 178 Once he became Emperor, Haile Selassie then appointed a commission to draft the document. The commission's leading members included the Europeans Gaston J√®ze and Johannes Kolmodin, but most prominently Ethiopian intellectuals such as Tekle Hawariat Tekle Mariyam and Gedamu Woldegiorgis. This constitution was based on the Meiji Constitution of Japan, a country that educated Ethiopians considered a model for its successful adoption of Western learning and technology to the framework of a non-Western culture.Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia: 1855‚Äì1991, second edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2001), p. 110 Unlike its Japanese model, the Ethiopian Constitution was a simple document of 55 articles arranged in seven chapters.Keller, Revolutionary Ethiopia (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991), p. 69 It asserted the Emperor's own status, reserved imperial succession to the line of Haile Selassie, and declared that \\"the person of the Emperor is sacred, his dignity inviolable, and his power indisputable.\\" All power over central and local government, the legislature, the judiciary, and the military was vested in the emperor. The constitution was essentially an effort to provide a legal basis for replacing the traditional provincial rulers with appointees loyal to the emperor. It was not intended to be a representative democracy, as the Emperor alone had the power to designate senators. According to Haile Selassie, the importance of this legal innovation was not understood \\"on the side of the officials and the people\\". To educate them on constitutional theory, he called the leading members of both groups to an assembly where its principal author, Tekle Hawariat, delivered a lengthy speech which not only described the contents of the document, but expounded a theory of constitutional law.Summarized in My Life and Ethiopia's Progress, vol. 1 pp. 185‚Äì200  Characteristics  The 1931 Constitution consists of the Decree proclaiming the constitution and seven chapters divided into 55 articles. The contents of the chapters are: # The Ethiopian Empire and the Succession to the Throne. Five articles stating that Ethiopia is the domain of the Emperor, who shall be a descendant \\"of his Majesty Haile Selassie I, descendant of King Sahle Selassie, whose line descends without interruption from the dynasty of Menelik I, son of King Solomon of Jerusalem and of the Queen of Ethiopia, known as the Queen of Sheba. # The Power and Prerogatives of the Emperor. Twelve articles setting forth the powers of the Emperor. # The Rights Recognized by the Emperor as belonging to the Nation, and the Duties Incumbent on the Nation. Twelve articles stating that \\"The Law\\" will define the conditions to become a subject of Ethiopia, and the duties of these subjects. This chapter also sets forth some rights subjects enjoy \\"except in the cases provided by law\\" (Articles 25, 26, 27) and while they \\"in no way limit the measures which the Emperor, by virtue of his supreme power, may take in the event of war or of public misfortunes menacing the interests of the nation\\" (Article 29). # The Deliberate Chambers of the Empire. Eighteen articles which established a bicameral parliament for Ethiopia. Until this document, there had never been a formal legislative body in Ethiopia. The lower chamber would temporarily be chosen by the Nobility (Mekuanent) and the local chiefs (Shumoch) \\"until the people are in a position to elect them themselves\\" (Article 32), while the upper chamber would be appointed by the Emperor. # The Ministers of the Empire. Two articles on the duties of government ministers, a system of executive officers which Menelik II had established in 1908.Bahru Zewde, A History, pp. 114‚Äì166 # Jurisdiction. Five articles setting forth the judicial system. Article 54 establishes Special Courts, required by the Klobukowski agreement of 1906, which gave foreigners extraterritoriality in Ethiopia, exempting them from both Ethiopian law and her justice system.Margary Perham, The Government of Ethiopia, second edition, p. 151 # The Budget of the Imperial Government. One article requiring the Government Treasury to set an annual budget, which directs how the government will spend its money.  Application  A few months later, on 3 November, the anniversary of the Emperor's own coronation, Haile Selassie convened the first parliament of the new constitution. Harold Marcus notes that Emperor Haile Selassie \\"hoped that the institution would stimulate nationalism and unity and that its members would popularize sociopolitical change in the provinces.\\"Marcus, Haile Sellassie I, p. 118 Following the restoration of Haile Selassie in 1941, he re-established the 1931 constitution, convening the parliament on 2 November 1942. This body included a chamber of deputies which was double its pre-war size, who were selected by a combination of an election, held on 9 March 1941, to elect a group of 20 for each of the 12 provinces, who would then meet at the provincial capitals to select five of their members to be deputies.Bereket Habte Selassie, \\"Constitutional Development in Ethiopia\\", Journal of African Law, 10 (1966), p. 78. Bereket claims that the election that began this process was held on 9 March 1941, almost two months before Haile Selassie made his triumphant return to his capital. Despite the resurrection of the parliament, Haile Selassie promulgated a number of laws in the form of proclamations and decrees. It was not until his proclamation 34/1943 that the authority of the parliament was included. Laws were issued under the authority of the Emperor and the parliament until the end of February 1944, when the sole authority of the Emperor again was used, which continued until the beginning of November of that year, when the parliament was again in session.Perham, The Government of Ethiopia, pp. 98f The Constitution of 1931 was superseded at the time of Emperor Haile Selassie's Silver Jubilee in 1955, when a new constitution was promulgated.

In the 1940s, the two Franciscan provinces still held 63 of 79 parishes in the dioceses of Vrhbosna and Mostar.Vjekoslav Perica. Balkan Idols: Religion and Nationalism in Yugoslav States. Oxford University Press. pp. 117‚Äì18 (2004). In June 1975 Pope Paul VI issued Romanis Pontificibus, a papal decree indicating which parishes the Franciscans were allowed to retain and which to turn over to diocesan administration. Beginning in 1976 Bishop ≈Ωaniƒá started to implement the decree. Full implementation was still being worked on as late as December 1998.\\"Visit of the Minister General to the Province of the Assumption of the BVM\\", cafarus.ch; accessed 12 September 2016.  Medjugorje  In early 1981, Franciscans Ivica Vego and Ivan Prusina refused to relinquish their posts, causing some controversy. ≈Ωaniƒá declared them suspended and sought to have them expelled from the order. By June six young people whom the two friars had been counseling claimed to have experienced apparitions of the Blessed Virgin. The reports attracted a number of pilgrims to the village of Medjugorje. On 11 January 1982, ≈Ωaniƒá established a commission to look into the alleged apparition. Three days later, three of the seers reported that the Madonna had said that the bishop had been too harsh with the Franciscans. In April 1986, ≈Ωaniƒá submitted a negative report of the apparitions to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, at the time Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith at the Vatican.Michaela Schauble, Narrating Victimhood: Gender, Religion and the Making of Place in Post-War Croatia (Bergahn, 2014), p. 119.Pavao ≈Ωaniƒá, The Truth About Medjugorje (English translation), booklet published in 1990. As the Medjugorje events had exceeded the scope of a local event, in January 1987, upon the suggestion of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Kuhariƒá and Bishop ≈Ωaniƒá made a joint communiqu√© in which they announced the formation of a third Commission under the direction of the Bishops Conference.Donovan, Colin.\\"Medjugorje\\", ewtn.com, 6 November 2013. In July, ≈Ωaniƒá forbade any priests who organized pilgrimages or came there ascribing a supernatural character to the events, to celebrate Mass in his diocese, and this until the Commission of the Bishops‚Äô Conference completed its inquiry.\\"ORDERS ON: THE NEWEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EVENTS IN MEDJUGORJE\\", ewtn.com, 18 September 2016. On 10 April 1991, the Yugoslav Episcopal Conference concurred with ≈Ωaniƒá's earlier finding of Non constat de supernaturalitate stating that: \\"On the basis of the investigations so far it can not be affirmed that one is dealing with supernatural apparitions and revelations.\\" Bishop ≈Ωaniƒá retired in 1993 at age 75 and was succeeded by Bishop Ratko Periƒá. ≈Ωaniƒá died at the Clinical Hospital Centre Firule in Split, Croatia aged 81 on 11 January 2000.

In a 1974 review, Vincent Canby described it \\"by far the most original, intelligent, witty and important film I've seen so far this year,\\" and \\"the most sophisticated and complex film from a Communist country that I've ever seen.\\" Plot Highly skilled engineer Jan Rudinski (Janez Vrhovec) comes to a mining town to install new heavy equipment. While in a barber shop, he asks his pretty blonde hairdresser Rajka (Milena Dravic) if she knows where he can get a room for a few weeks. She does, in her parents' home, where she also lives. She soon starts flirting with her much older lodger, while also fending off the advances of a handsome young truck driver (Boris Dvornik). In an unrelated subplot, mine worker Barbulovic (Stole Aranƒëeloviƒá) gets into one mess after another. He is arrested for starting a bar brawl in which the singer, Fatima, is stabbed. He is released after a few days, and complains to his manager about his docked pay, to no avail. When his wife (Eva Ras) returns home from a visit, she discovers that three of her dresses are missing. She accuses him of giving them to his mistress. When she sees the other woman wearing one of them at the market, she attacks her rival. They are taken to the police station, but let go with some advice. With her parents away for several days, Rajka invites Jan to sleep with her. The middle-aged man hesitates, concerned about the age difference between them, but soon gives in. They are happy together. When she expresses concern that his work is nearly over and he will be leaving soon, he tells her he will take her with him. Rajka's parents return and learn what has been going on, whereupon they berate the couple. Jan is asked to complete his work several days ahead of schedule so the plant can be part of a big export deal. When he drives his crew to finish the job as requested, a government representative from Belgrade comes to present him with a medal for his long exemplary service. Jan is puzzled when Rajka does not show up at a concert and banquet in his honor. She, it turns out, has succumbed to the charms of the truck driver. Jan asks her afterward if she has another lover. When she is evasive, he asks how old his rival is; she answers 20 or 22, but claims it does not matter to their relationship. This does not appease his anger, and she flees.

CASI was formed as the South-East Asia Division of Continental in April 1965 with operations starting in September 1965 using approximately 22, mainly STOL, aircraft. Continental paid over a million US dollars for BirdAir (Bird and Sons) and its 350 employees and 22 aircraft. CASI aircraft in Laos were registered as Air Continental. As of 1998 Continental Airlines still operated in the Pacific Islands.P.6 Wings of Air America, A Photo History by Terry Love In 2010 Continental merged into United Airlines. Organization CASI, as a Nevada Corporation, was officially located at One East First Street, Reno, Nevada but its headquarters was located at 7300 World Way West, Los Angeles, California. CASI maintained Overseas Offices in Bangkok Thailand, Vientiane (Laos), & Saigon (South Vietnam). CASI's Southeast Asia headquarters was in Vientiane, Laos, with operations bases at Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Vientiane, Laos, Singapore, Bangkok, Udorn, Thailand and Saigon, Vietnam. CASI's original purpose was to operate aircraft and ground facilities to support projects involving construction, oil exploration and engineering companies as well as contracts with USAID and other government agencies.Martin Best, The CIA's Airlines: Logistic Air Support of the War in Laos 1954 to 1975, Martin Best - Air-America.Org. 2002. Since CASI was operating under US government contracts CASI had a liaison with the US government, Pierre Salinger, who was designated as Vice-Present of the operation. Because CASI operated in the southeast Asia region to assist the US government at the conclusion of the war Continental Airlines (CAL) was granted a contract with the Micronesian Trust Territory to set up and operate an airline (Air Micronesia) in the Micronesian islands for a designated period (6 years). After the 6 years CAL was to turn over the operation to the Trust Territory authorities but that never happen for a number of reasons. Today, CAL, now United Airlines, continues to operate in that region with a base in Guam. Uniforms Initially CASI uniforms were locally made khaki uniforms which were manufactured in different parts of Laos, Thailand or Vietnam. Some shirts are 2-pocket, others are 4-pocket safari-type jackets. Most CASI pilots were issued the baseball cap. A few of the early CASI pilots were issued the \\"bus driver\\" hat.

During the Korean War he served in the Marines. According to the 1959 Purdue University yearbook, his hometown was Huntington, Indiana and he was a member of the honorary engineering societies Pi Tau Sigma, Tau Beta Pi, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He earned a bachelor's degree with honors in mechanical engineering from Purdue University in 1959 and a master's degree in teaching from Ball State University. He never married, had no children, and was estranged from his two brothers. After 23 years of working at Allied Signal Aerospace he was forced into early retirement, and began living on the streets. While living on the streets, he was always neat and clean and wore a baseball cap and small backpack, but was very reserved and lacked social skills. He did not own a car. Rita Belle, a volunteer nurse with the mission, befriended Walters for nine years and helped him find temporary housing after she learned that he slept behind a local senior center. Nevertheless, he chose to leave the housing after a short time. He used the telephone in the center's billiards room to make his investments, and he completed his own income tax forms. During his last years he suffered from severe diabetes and high blood pressure. He had two operations on his legs to improve his circulation, two operations on his eyes, and a quadruple bypass heart operation. After suffering a stroke he contacted Belle, but at first resisted hospitalization because he felt he hadn't benefited from previous medical treatments.

McNamara was known as a tough and stubborn trader in the wheat business. He built trading relationships abroad by visiting foreign customers and inviting them to visit Canada in return. Under McNamara, wheat prices remained relatively stable, customers where guaranteed a fixed price for the life of the sale while the United States wished to sell its wheat on a sliding scale with the price fluctuating based on market demands. The difference in approach led to a complaint from the United States that Canada had pegged the world price of wheat. McNamara argued that this policy kept prices stable and prevented the price from dropping sharply - the Wheat Board under his stewardship would also withhold wheat from the market when demand was soft in order to keep the price stable. \\"We are out to sell to the best advantage of the Canadian producer,\\" he said. \\"This dominates our thinking; this is what we were created for.\\" ReferencesExternal links * 1904 births 1984 deaths Canadian senators from Manitoba Liberal Party of Canada senators 20th-century Canadian civil servants ","title":"William Craig McNamara"},{"id":"23767168","text":"Elk Pass (el. ) is a high mountain pass in the Canadian Rockies, traversing the continental divide. It connects the Elk Valley in the province of British Columbia with the Kananaskis Valley in Alberta. The pass is unusual by its width, as the two valleys were created from a single glaciated trench. The 1916 Alberta/British Columbia Provincial Boundary Surveyors subdivided it into two routes labeled as \\"West Passage\\" and \\"East Passage.\\" These would later be gazetteered as West Elk Pass and East Elk Pass. Elk Pass is inaccessible to conventional road traffic. On the Albertan side it reaches into Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, while on the British Columbian side it is slightly east of Elk Lakes Provincial Park. The Trans Canada Trail has hoped to designate preexisting hiking trails through the Elk Pass as its continental divide- crossing section, but has come into conflict with coal mines in the Upper Elk Valley over the impacts such a routing would have on their ability to expand their mine sites. In the past, residents of Elkford, British Columbia had proposed extending British Columbia Highway 43 over the pass and into Alberta, creating a new all-weather route from B.C. to Calgary, but in light of enhanced environmental protection on the Albertan side, the project is no longer considered likely.

Its social work department was founded 1962 by Dr. I. K. Gill and work for the leprosy patients and their family members was started. A Leprosy Clinic was bought in April 1963 and patients from all over Pakistan and even from Afghanistan came for treatment. In two years' time, MALC was transferred to a proper hospital building and established a full-service leprosy treatment and rehabilitation center, free to patients. Volunteer specialists helped, but the staff consists mainly of former patients trained to diagnose and treat the disease and to keep records. Meanwhile, Dr. Pfau took note of the home districts of her patients and identified Pakistan's leprosy belt-the first step in creating a national program of eradication. Inadequate resources and budget cuts for Pakistan's anti-leprosy program may herald a revival of the disease, especially in poorer areas of the country. Anti-leprosy projects have been integrated into a \\"multi-purpose health program,\\" depriving them of funds specifically promised for fighting leprosy. Though the new government five- year plan earmarks funds to combat leprosy, the budget shortfall is more than 7 million rupees (US$325,000). Pakistan is on the threshold of achieving a leprosy-free society, the goal is being stifled because of financial constraints. Though leprosy therapy in use since 1983 is effective, it is expensive and requires patients to receive weekly doses of medicine no longer widely available. The situation is particularly acute in mountainous regions and distant villages with limited access to medicine and doctors. More than 70 relief centers operate in Pakistan. New centers are opening in the North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan, where a large influx of Afghan refugees has brought many patients suffering from leprosy. Sister Pfau said that if necessary funds and essential facilities are provided, most leprosy patients will eventually be cured. The Centre also helped Hermanegild Marcos Antonio Drago start a leprosy center in a room of his clinic in Mirpur Khas for patients who would otherwise need to travel to Karachi for treatment. This has evolved into the Marie Adelaide Drago government leprosy clinic which treats hundreds of patients each year. In 2003, there are an estimated 20,000 leprosy cases still in Pakistan and 12,000 people already disabled remain in need of care. In 2010 the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre building has grown to eight storeys. Dr. Pfau is being hailed as Pakistan's 'Mother Teresa'.

The school served fifth and sixth graders. In the spring of 2013, Chapman Intermediate School was closed, as it was no longer needed. Students who would have attended it now attend one of the four feeder elementary schools until fifth grade, and then attend E.T. Booth Middle School in sixth grade. Chapman opened in 2000 with approximately 1150 fifth and sixth grade students and a staff of almost 100. History Until 1935, there was a small school located across from Bascomb Church on what is now Bascomb-Carmel Road. It consisted of grades one through seven. For the first few years of his teaching career, Clarence Chapman was the principal as well as one of the teachers. In 1935, Bascomb School was consolidated with another elementary school and was later torn down. South Cherokee County remained a rural area into the mid-1960s. Highway 92 was paved in 1962. Until that time it had been an all-weather graveled road and was known as the Old Alabama Road. By 1966, Oak Grove School still had only one teacher per grade, from fourth through eighth grade. The total enrollment was 350 students. Woodstock School had an enrollment of around 600 students. Around this time, south Cherokee County began growing by leaps and bounds. People began moving to the area and driving to work in Atlanta. Woodstock Elementary and Oak Grove Elementary were both too small for the incoming students. Rooms and buildings were added, only to be outgrown before they were completed. A new school was the only answer. The property of the Chapman family was purchased for the new school. Construction was begun in 1971 and completed in February 1974. From August 1973 until February 1974, the Chapman faculty and students were split and located at Woodstock and Oak Grove. The school opened with grades one through eight. The first principal was Young Smith. During the 1970s and 1980s, the area continued to grow and E.T. Booth Middle School was built and opened nearby. The seventh and eighth grade students from Chapman and other south Cherokee elementary schools were transferred to the new middle school. A large two-story classroom building was added to the Chapman campus in 1990 to accommodate its ever-increasing enrollment. During the 1998-1999 school year, once again some decisions were needed to make arrangements for the growing schools in the area. With parent and faculty input, the decision was made to create a school for fifth and sixth grade students and to house this new school at the Chapman campus. Preparations were made to transition these students from Bascomb, Boston, and Oak Grove Elementaries. In August 2000, Chapman Intermediate School opened with approximately 1150 fifth and sixth grade students and a staff of almost 100. In 2011, the building of the new E.T. Booth Middle School began. This took sixth grade, and the elementary schools took fifth grade. It is speculated that Chapman will become a ninth grade academy for Etowah High School. In January 2014, Chapman became Etowah East High School and featured some technology-based classes, such as AP Computer Science. In the 2014-2015 school year, Chapman's cafeteria opened to students traveling between Etowah High School and Etowah East. The other building at Etowah East became home to the world language department in August 2014. As a result, all trailers at Etowah High were scheduled to be removed from campus at the end of the 2013-2014 school year.

Allender is known for his work on Expanding the Canon, a television series on teaching multicultural literature produced in collaboration with Thirteen/WNET and AnnenbergCPB.  Education Allender began his career as a high school English teacher. He earned his PhD at the University of Queensland, Australia and teaches coursework in multicultural literature, urban education, linguistics for educators, and new literacies. In addition to teaching at UC Berkeley, Allender has taught and lectured at a number of other colleges and universities, including San Francisco State University, New York University, Stanford University, University of California, Los Angeles, Fordham University, and Medgar Evers College.  Career The Center for Civic Engagement is the umbrella office for all of the public purpose programs of Lick-Wilmerding High School. Allender was appointed Interim Executive Director in July 2010. Allender at Reading is Fundamental gala The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), a professional development organization for English Language Arts educators at all levels, is one of the oldest non-profit institutions in the United States. While serving as Associate Executive Director of NCTE for five years Allender served as Interim Executive Director for the Council. In 2003 he launched NCTE West at the University of California Berkeley. As a high-school teacher, Allender taught English by incorporating issues of social justice taught to him by educators who were formerly members of the Black Panther Party and The Young Lords (the Puerto Rican counterpart of the Black Panther Party. This precipitated death threats that garnered national attention because educators and the public wanted to know what he was teaching. After earning a reputation for being progressive and successfully addressing contentious issues in education, Allender was hired by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE). In 2004 Allender moderated a conversation between parents and teachers on the use of Mark Twain in the classroom in the Bloomington-Normal, Illinois school district. The dialogue included the Illinois State University English department, the Mayor's office, the NACCP, and school superintendent's office. Since NCTE is opposed to the censorship of literature, the teachers involved felt that Allender would support their stance on the use of Mark Twain in the classroom. But, at the same time, since Allender is African American parents felt that he would support the book's removal for its use of \\"the n-word\\". Allender was asked to help the parents and teachers work through the impasse by leading them through the process of doing an ethnographic study of their experiences. In 2006 NCTE West was the gathering place for the first ever 21st century Literacies Impact Conference sponsored by the Verizon Foundation, Apple Inc., and The Partnerships for 21st century Schools, E-Luminate Group. Allender's work with the Partnership for 21st century Skills on the English Language Arts Literacy Map was the inspiration for the conference which brought together the leading education content area groups: NCTE , NCTM , NCSS , and NSTA . Working with students from Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, Allender produced a video documenting this conference.NCTE TV (a web channel created by Allender in 2009) The Bay Area Teachers Center (BATC) is a single-subject teacher credential program created as a partnership between San Francisco State University and Lick-Wilmerding High School. Allender was appointed Executive Director of BATC in 2007. Under Allender's leadership, BATC expanded partnerships with the Graduate School of Education at UC Berkeley and Teach Tomorrow Oakland, a project of the Mayor's office and the Oakland United School District. Allender also revamped the BATC curriculum to incorporate online courses using NCTE \\"Pathways for 21st Century Literacy\\" and \\"Pathways for Adolescent Literacy\\" in the Instructional Technology and content area courses.  Advisory boards and partnerships  Allender is a founding member of the Cable in the Classroom Educational Advisory Board and serves on several other boards for a variety of organizations including Media Rights, the Center for Black Literature at Medgar Evers College, Art21, and Scenarios USA. He has acted in an advisory capacity with many other institutions including The Independent Film Channel/Film School project, the Anti Defamation League‚Äôs Echoes and Reflections, and A World of Difference Online. In addition, Allender served as lead advisor or advisory board member for seven Annenberg/CPB professional development television series for English language arts educators.  Awards  Allender's awards include the Summer Institute for Echoes and Reflections Scholars in Jerusalem Fellowship; the Media award from National Association for Multicultural Education and the Education award from the US International Film and Video Festival for the eight-part professional development television series The Expanding Canon.

Since 1991 he has held the Rhoda Thalhimer Endowed Chair of American Art in the School of Arts, Virginia Commonwealth University, , a highly ranked art department. Since 2004 he has served as a visiting professor at Yale University. He has held positions at Cornell University, University of Iowa, Florida State University, and Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art in Iran, and is known for a number of books, in-depth essays, and exhibitions. Early life Born in 1946, Hobbs is the son of scientist Charles S. Hobbs, who is best known for conducting the primary research on fluorine and teeth as well as investigating, over a thirty-year period, the residual genetic effects of the nuclear fallout on beef cattle found within a 150-mile radius of Los Alamos. His mother, Corinne Clay, was a coloratura soprano with a repertoire in five languages. While living in his family's scenic retreat where the Tennessee Valley Authority (T.V.A.) had been planned, Robert Hobbs enrolled in the early 1960s in Maryville High School, which in the post-Sputnik era had a greater percentage of students attending M.I.T. than any other high school in the nation. During this time he was employed summers, running routine experiments in a chemical lab and acting in local college theatrical productions. In 1969 Hobbs received his B.A. at the University of Tennessee (Knoxville), working with Dale Cleaver, who was a student of Joshua Taylor, who in turn had studied with Heinrich W√∂lfflin. In 1975 he was awarded a Ph.D. degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His dissertation director was philosopher, art historian, and poet Donald Kuspit, who had been a student of the Frankfurt School director Theodor Adorno.http://arthistorians.info/kuspitd Combining philosophic, social history, and formalist views, Hobbs wrote a dissertation on Robert Motherwell's Elegies to the Spanish Republic while participating in the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program. The next year, as a lecturer at Yale University, he lived in Motherwell's guesthouse in Greenwich, Connecticut, and turned sections of his dissertation into essays for the catalogue that accompanied this artist's first European retrospective. Academic career After accepting the position of assistant professor at Cornell University, Hobbs co-curated in 1978 Abstract Expressionism: The Formative Years (with Gail Levin), which was jointly organized by Cornell's Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art. This exhibition provided the first retrospective view of early Abstract Expressionism and helped to redirect studies of the material away from the then predominantly formalist views of New York critic Clement Greenberg. In 1978 Hobbs took a leave of absence from Cornell in order to assume the position of Chief Curator of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art and direct Farabi University's museum affiliated program. Finding himself in the throes of a full-scale revolution, he was able to leave Tehran in December 1978, the last day before the airport closed. Several years later, as an associate professor at Cornell, he curated the first retrospective of earth artist Robert Smithson, which was shown at the Whitney in 1981. In addition to being presented in five United States' venues, this exhibition was selected as the U.S. official representation for the 1982 Venice Biennale, and it subsequently traveled to five European museums. An adjunct to this exhibition was Hobbs' Cornell University Press monograph on Smithson's sculpture, which has come to be regarded as a standard reference on this subject. Hobbs became Director of the University of Iowa Museum of Art in 1982. For this institution, he co-curated with Gaylord Torrence the first exhibition to look chronologically at a single American Indian tribe's development. Entitled Art of the Red Earth People: The Mesquakie of Iowa, this exhibition and its co- authored catalogue surveyed 200 years of Mesquakie art history.Robert Hobbs and Gaylord Torrence, Art of the Red Earth People, Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1989. While at the University of Iowa, Hobbs also brokered the gift of the important Stanley Collection of African Art, oversaw the publication of this collection by Christopher D. Roy, and co-curated with Fredrick Woodard Human Rights, Human Wrongs: Art and Social Change: Essays by the Faculty of the University of Iowa, which showcased a wide range of disciplinary views of individual works of art that varied from neurologist Ant√≥nio Dam√°sio's trenchant insights to Jorie Graham's erudite and complex poetry.http://roberthobbs.net/book_files/Human_Rights-Human_Wrongs.pdf In 1988 Hobbs returned to full-time teaching at Florida State University, and in 1991 he accepted the Rhoda Thalhimer Endowed Chair at VCU. Since this time he has continued to work as both a scholar and a curator. Among his exhibitions are a retrospective of Lee Krasner's art, which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and traveled to the Brooklyn Museum, and also a retrospective of Mark Lombardi's drawings, which was shown at New York City's Drawing Center and Toronto's AGO. In addition, he curated the extensive group show Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art of the South and the one-person exhibition Thornton Dial: Remembering the Road, which were both organized in conjunction with the Michael C. Carlos Museum, Emory University, in conjunction with the 1996 Cultural Olympiad in Atlanta. In 2002 his Kara Walker exhibition Slavery! Slavery! became the U.S. official representation at the S√£o Paulo Bienal. He co-curated with Jean Crutchfield in 2011 Tavares Strachan: seen/unseen that took place from September 19 through October 28, 2011, at an undisclosed location in New York City. In 2012‚Äì13, Hobbs curated the exhibitions Cellblock I and Cellblock II at Andrea Rosen Gallery in New York City. Later that year, Hobbs and Crutchfield also co-curated Strachan's exhibition Polar Eclipse which represented the Bahamas at the 55th Venice Biennale. Former students include Duchamp specialist Craig Adcock, Robert Ryman scholar Vittorio Colaizzi, filmmaker and artist Shelly Silver, biographer and New York Times critic Deborah Solomon, and New York abstract painter James Siena. Publications Hobbs has continued to write extensively on modern and postmodern art, including investigations of the work of the following artists (listed alphabetically): Alice Aycock, Hernan Bas, Duane Hanson, Keith Haring, Jonathan Lasker, Mark Lindquist, Malcolm Morley, Robert Motherwell, Beverly Pepper, Richard Pousette-Dart, Neo Rauch, Andres Serrano, Yinka Shonibare, James Siena, Frank Stella, Frank Thiel, Kara Walker, Kelley Walker, John Wesley, and Kehinde Wiley, among others. His \\"Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology and Installation Art\\" (2001) for the Mattress Factory discerns relations between this philosopher's thought and Harold Rosenberg's criticism, and it underscores the impact of both on the development of installation art in the late 1950s, thus demonstrating how this French philosopher's ideas were important to New York artists over a decade before the advent of Robert Morris's minimalism.Robert Hobbs. \\"Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology and Installation Art\\" in Claudia Giannini, ed., Installations Mattress Factory: 1990‚Äì1999. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2001. His \\"Affluence, Taste, and the Brokering of Knowledge: Notes on the Social Context of Early Conceptual Art\\" looks at the social history of collecting and taste as well as the tremendous respect for education in the 1950s and early 1960s that helped to prepare the way for the rapid and relatively widespread acceptance of conceptual art in the 1960s.Robert Hobbs, \\"Affluence, Taste, and the Brokering of Knowledge: Notes on the Social Context of Early Conceptual Art\\", in Michael Corris, ed., Conceptual Art: Theory, Myth, and Practice (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004). Hobbs has written in-depth essays for the Rubell Collection (Miami), including a historical overview, titled \\"Looking B(l)ack: Reflections of White Racism\\" (for the well-received exhibition 30 Americans) that looks at the challenges, goals, and sensibilities facing African-American artists from the 1980s to the present. Personal life In 1994 Hobbs married Jean Crutchfield, who had established a reputation for directing cutting-edge galleries in New York, Chicago, and Paris. [Having grown up in Geneva, Switzerland where she attended the International School, she is fluent in French.] She has worked closely with such artists as Alice Aycock, Christian Boltanski, David Ireland, Alfredo Jaar, Sherrie Levine, Kay Rosen,http://www.yvon-lambert.com/kay_rosen-A52.html and Lorna Simpson. Since their marriage, Crutchfield co-curated The Art of Aggression, and she has curated Presumed Innocence, as well as one-person shows of the work of Diana Cooper, Gregory Crewdson (first museum showing), Yoko Ono, and Monique Prieto (first museum showing), in addition to continuing to serve as a fine arts consultant.

He earned the medal while serving as a stretcher bearer during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, when he and another soldier, Charles D. Barger, entered no man's land despite heavy fire and rescued two wounded officers. Biography Born in New Hampton, Missouri, Funk later moved to Calhan, Colorado, where he worked as a rancher. He married and had one son before entering the Army in 1915. After training at Camp Funston in Kansas, Funk was sent to Europe with the 354th Infantry Regiment, 89th Division. He saw action in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and, by October 31, 1918, was a private first class serving as a stretcher bearer in the 354th Regiment's Company L. On that day, near Bois-de- Bantheville, France, Funk's division sent several patrols into no man's land to reconnoiter German positions in preparation for an advance as part of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Unusually, the patrols had been sent out during daylight, rather than waiting for the cover of darkness. Two patrols from Funk's regiment became pinned down by heavy rifle and machine gun fire. Second Lieutenant John M. Millis was seriously wounded in the legs and ordered his men to leave without him. One man managed to crawl to the safety of the Allied lines and brought news that Millis and another wounded officer were trapped in no man's land. Upon hearing this, Funk and another stretcher bearer, Private First Class Charles D. Barger, voluntarily ran through heavy machine gun fire with their stretcher and rescued Millis. They then returned to no man's land and rescued the other officer, First Lieutenant Ernest G. Rowell. For these actions, both Funk and Barger were awarded the Medal of Honor the next year. These were the only Medals of Honor received by Army medical personnel in World War I. Funk reached the rank of corporal before leaving the Army in 1920.Service Profile He died at age 44 and was buried at Calhan Cemetery in Calhan, Colorado. Medal of Honor Citation Medal of Honor Presentation Ceremony - February 9, 1919, at Chaumont, France. General John J. Pershing presided. Funk's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > Learning that 2 daylight patrols had been caught out in No Man's Land and > were unable to return, Pfc.

The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of the fungus are edible. It is found growing from termitaria in grassy fields, on hillsides, and in forest borders in China, Vietnam, India and elsewhere. Taxonomy First described scientifically as Agaricus albuminosus by the English mycologist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1847, it was transferred to the genus Termitomyces in 1941 by the French botanist Roger Heim and in 1972, to the genus Macrolepiota by the British mycologist David Pegler. It appears in the scientific literature under all these names. Description The fruiting body of Macrolepiota albuminosa is produced on a stalk up to long which is swollen near the base. Remnants of the veil form a ring near the top of the stem. The cap is conical at first, becoming umbonate (with a knobby protrusion at the centre) as it opens out and flattening with age, sometimes splitting at the edges. The skin of the cap peels readily. The cap is whitish or pale tan, with a darker centre, the gills are white and the stem is white. The spore print is deep pink. Ecology Macrolepiota albuminosa is the fungus used by the termite Odontotermes obesus in the fungus garden (also called the comb) in its underground nest. The termites collect and chew up dead wood, leaf litter and other vegetable debris, depositing their faeces in the fungus garden situated in a central chamber of their nest. The hyphae of the fungus grow through the comb and the termites feed on the fungal threads. Periodically the fungus sends hyphae to the surface of the ground where mushroom-like fruiting bodies are formed. It is probable that the fungus is introduced into a newly-established termite colony through the activities of the termites collecting spores from the environment. This fungus is edible and is collected from the wild in northern India in September, about a month later than the rather similar, but smaller Macrolepiota heimii. Uses This fungus grows in China in the provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou and Guangdong. It is described as being \\"fleshy, fat, fine silky white, crisp and refreshing, fresh and delicious, and rich in nutrients\\". It is also used in traditional medicine for various purposes including enhancing the immune system, nourishing the blood and preventing bowel cancer. Attempts are being made to culture it in the laboratory under different conditions of temperature, pH, and different sources of carbon and nitrogen to discover its optimal requirements.

The single-seat Airbike was introduced in 1994 and the two-seat Tandem Airbike was unveiled in 1996.Cliche, Andre: Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide 8th Edition, pages B-3 & B-68. Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. Originally produced by TEAM Aircraft of Bradyville, Tennessee, manufacturing passed to ISON Aircraft, also of Bradyville, before the end of kit production. Starting circa 2009 kits became once again available once again from Jordan Lake Aero. Development The single seat Airbike was designed to meet the requirements of the United States FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles, including the maximum empty weight. The tandem-seat model was intended to be licensed as an ultralight trainer or an amateur-built aircraft. The single-seater can achieve an empty weight as low as with the use of a light-weight engine, such as the Rotax 277 or the Zenoah G-25. The name Airbike was chosen for the aircraft because it has a narrow fuselage and the pilot's feet rest on rudder pedals that are on the outside of the aircraft, in a similar manner to a motorcycle. The Tandem Airbike retains all of the single-seater's features and has a stretched fuselage to accommodate the second seat. It uses a wing of span with an area of 152 sq ft (14.14 sq m). Design An Airbike at Sun 'n Fun 2004 showing the external rudder pedals Both variants feature a parasol wing constructed from wood and covered with aircraft fabric. The wing has full-span ailerons or, in the case of the two-seater, optional electrically-actuated flaperons. All controls are cable-operated. The elevator and rudder are conventional. The fuselage is made from welded 4130 steel tube and the aircraft has conventional landing gear with tail wheel steering connected to the rudder pedals. The main landing gear utilises sprung-tubes for suspension and absorbing landing loads. The Airbike was sold as an assembly kit. The kit included a pre-welded fuselage and tail, pre-built main wing spars and ribs, all brackets and fittings, landing gear, engine, propeller, instruments and a five-gallon fuel tank. The company estimated the time to complete the aircraft at 150 hours for the single-seater. The price in 2001 for the single-seat Airbike was US$7195 The Tandem Airbike had a factory estimated construction time of 200‚Äì300 hours or 100‚Äì150 hours if the quick-built kit option was purchased. In 2001 the kits price was US$8000 without engine or propeller. Operational history In December 1998 the company reported that 127 single-seaters were flying, the majority as US unregistered ultralights and 23 tandem-seaters. In July 2009 there were 45 Airbikes registered as experimental amateur-builts or light sport aircraft in the USA. Variants ;Airbike :Single seat aircraft designed for the US ultralight category.

Hackney RFC has five senior teams, playing home matches at Spring Hill Recreation Ground. They are currently playing in London 2 North West (a tier 7 league in the English rugby union system) after gaining promotion from London 3 North West as champions in the 2016-17 season. Current Hackney RFC currently fields four senior men's teams and two women's team, playing home matches at Spring Hill Recreation Ground. The men's 1st XV competes in London 2 North West. The 2nd XV and 3rd XV compete in the Middlesex Merit League, in the premier and 3rd Divisions respectively. The 4th XV began playing friendlies in the 2011/12 season. The Hackney Ladies (known as the Gladies) compete in Women's NC London & South East Division 2 North and began a 2nd team which was entered into the league structure in 2018. Hackney Bulls Youth RFC is the club's thriving youth section which merged with the senior side in 2014, with over 200 children playing from aged 6 up to 16 years old. The main aim of the club is to create playing opportunities for every group within the London Borough of Hackney and surrounding areas, from mini level continuously up to senior level. The local newspaper, the Hackney Gazette, reports on the club's progress throughout the season. Formation The club was formed in 1965 for former pupils of Woodberry Down Comprehensive School. The newly created Old Griffins Rugby Football Club adopted the school's colours, motto, and the Griffin from the school crest. Despite its affiliation, the Old Griffins was an open club from its early days, though it only changed its name to Hackney RFC when it entered into negotiations with Hackney Council over the vacant Spring Hill Recreation Ground. The 1st XV and Ladies 1st XV plays in a quartered kit, with the original 3 colours from the Old Griffins combined with a fourth colour (green) gained from partnering with a French club. The other sides play in variations of the original Old Griffins colours Clubhouse fire The prospects for Hackney RFC were severely damaged when its clubhouse was destroyed by a fire in April 1999. At the beginning of that season, the club fielded four sides on a regular basis with the 1st XV competing in London 3 (Level 7). Without facilities, the club lost a large part of its playing base. The club plummeted down through the leagues and in 2004 was playing in Herts/Middlesex North 3 (Level 11), fulfilling its fixtures on an intermittent basis and often playing without a full complement of 15 players. The club had no changing rooms and used the facilities of the Lea Valley Rowing Club. Post- match hospitality was provided by The Swan Public House. Recent history The club managed to reverse its decline through good recruitment, player enthusiasm and the unwavering commitment of the club's committee. The 2004/05 and 2005/06 season saw the club fulfill every fixture. Building on this progress, the club won Herts/Middlesex North 3 but was not promoted to Level 10 due to a restructure of the lower leagues. The club demonstrated that it belonged at a higher level by winning promotion again in the 2008/09 season. This season also saw the launch of a 2nd XV side, nicknamed the Hackney Gargoyles. The club's rugby sevens side also finished runners up in the Middlesex Sevens Jug Competition. The following year, the club fielded a 3rd XV side, now known as the Gogs, for the first time in 12 years. The 2nd and 3rd teams progressed quickly up the Merit league structure with the Gargoyles reaching Merit 1 in 2015. The Hackney Ladies side were formed in 2010 and soon joined the RFU women's league, gaining promotion in 2013. They continue to expand rapidly and have increased their membership dramatically over the past few years. Following a further league championship for the 1st XV in 2014, the club enjoyed a historic season in 2016/17 with the 1st XV going the entire season unbeaten and dropping just one bonus point alongside the 2nd XV becoming league champions and the 3rd XV winning the cup. Hackney RFC now uses the Spring Hill Recreation Ground changing rooms as its base following its reopening in 2011, though it lost the use of The Swan Public house when the owners sold the premises to a local synagogue. The club now hosts opposition teams at the Mascara bar, Stamford Hill. Guinness Club Together In 2009 Hackney RFC won the Guinness Club Together competition, a free programme aimed at supporting grassroots rugby clubs across the UK. Hackney was awarded the title having doubled its playing membership over the previous year despite its lack of facilities. Hackney travelled to Twickenham on May 16, 2009. Starting with a training session with legendary coach Shaun Edwards (of London Wasps, Wales and The British and Irish Lions) the teams were driven to HQ and ran out onto the hallowed turf as a curtain raiser for the Guinness Premiership final. The Griffins beat the Gargoyles by 12 - 5.

Today it is a historic site of the province, informally known as \\"the Asturian Escorial\\" (el Escorial Asturiano), due to the burial there of King Bermudo I of Asturias (died 797) and his family. History The abbey was founded in 1022 through a donation of land by Count Pi√±olo Jim√©nez (Piniolo) and his wife Aldonza Mu√±oz, wealthy Leonese aristocrats. The construction of the planned monastery, built in the Romanesque style, was completed in 1043 and a monastic community was established there the following year. The first abbot was Arias Cromaz, a relative of Piniolo and thus also of Oveco, who was Bishop of Oviedo from 913 to about 960. After 19 years as abbot, Arias was named Bishop of Oviedo by King Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile. Land disputes arose with the various powers of the region during its early days, and, about the turn of the 12th century, a number of agreements are recorded between Count Fernando D√≠az, one of the most powerful lords of the region, and Munio, the Abbot of Corias, wherein a number of towns were swapped. The abbey reached the peak of its power in the 12th and 13th centuries, with properties stretching across western Asturias and into the neighboring Province of Le√≥n. Nonetheless, the monks were a major influence in the agricultural development of the region, as they introduced viticulture, as well as the raising of cereals and tobacco to Asturias. They also had an important influence on local methods of cattle- raising, with the establishment of pastures in the higher elevations of the land. Over the centuries, they also refined methods for more effective hunting and fishing on the abbatial lands, as well as for its management. The monastic complex received various modifications and additions over the centuries, but a large fire in 1763 destroyed the building, with the exception of the 16th- century monastery church and its sacristy. The abbey was rebuilt in the Neoclassical style. The plans for the new building were designed by Lucas Ferro Caaveiro, a leading architect from Galicia. Due to his death in 1770, construction was begun in 1774 under the supervision of Ventura Rodr√≠guez, using a rectangular layout with two courtyards, built around the abbey church located in a side wing. Among its surviving treasures are a 12th-century crucifix, popularly called the \\"Christ of the Cantonada\\". It is considered to be among the finest pieces of Romanesque art in Asturias. One consequence of the fire, however, is that the graves of King Bermudo and his family can no longer be identified. Natural park Today the former abbey is a complex of structures classified as a Bien de Inter√©s Cultural and protected by the Spanish government. It houses a parador and an interpretation center for a natural park. ReferencesPrimary sources *El Libro Registro de Corias, 2 vols., ed. A. C. Floriano Cumbre√±o. Oviedo: 1950.

It is based on the true story of Jamie Fuller, a 16-year-old high school student who murdered his 14-year-old girlfriend, Amy Carnevale, on August 23, 1991, in Beverly, Massachusetts. A remake of No One Would Tell debuted on Lifetime on September 16, 2018. Plot This story takes place in North High School, where Stacy Collins is a shy 16-year-old high school student who has secretly been in love with Bobby Tennison for two years. She is surprised when he starts to show a romantic interest in her, considering he is a senior wrestler, and the most popular guy in school. They soon start dating, and find out that both of their fathers had abandoned them. She is upset that her mother, Laura, is dating a man named Rod who treats her very badly, and Stacy often urges her to leave him and treat herself better. After a few weeks of dating, Bobby starts showing possessive behavior. He is jealous whenever another guy approaches or talks about Stacy, and doesn't want her to hang out with anyone when they are together. At first, she doesn't suspect that there is anything wrong, because he immediately apologizes after getting mad at her and tells her that he loves her and gives her gifts to show his remorse. Stacy soon promises to him that they will be together forever. She also agrees not to hang out with other people anymore even if he is not around. At school, boys start to notice her after her best friend, Nicki, convinces her to wear a mid-thigh length skirt for Bobby. In the boys' locker room, one of the boys gives her a compliment, which outrages him. After this, he furiously tells her she looks like a slut and demands that she wear proper clothes and forces her to change the skirt in the bathroom and into a pair of his track pants. She tries to explain that she was only dressing up for him, but he becomes more furious before throwing and slamming her into the wall. Back at home, Laura worries that Stacy is spending too much time with him, but she assures her that he loves her and vice versa. Meanwhile, Nicki and her friend, Val Cho, also grow concerned about Stacy‚Äôs relationship with him. Nicki soon learns from her cousin, Donna Fowler, that he has a history of being physically abusive and his last girlfriend moved away because of it. Her worry grows when she notices that Stacy has several unexplained bruises on her body. She talks to her about what she heard, but Stacy, frustrated, assures her that she can take care of herself. By accident, Stacy meets Bobby's mother; He catches them talking to each other and becomes furious and violent. Upset, she refuses to see him again, and later takes it out on Laura, calling her irresponsible. Bobby later wins Stacy‚Äôs trust back by telling her about the alcoholism that runs in his family. His father was an abusive alcoholic and she couldn't leave him. His father left on his own. They are happy for a while, but trouble begins again when he sees her talking to another boy at the school dance. He pulls her outside into the parking lot and slaps her, all of which is witnessed by Nicki and her boyfriend, Tony, who are nearby. Nicki quickly confronts Stacy about how badly Bobby is treating her, but she defends him, saying he's been through a lot. When Nicki flat out says that he doesn't love her, she angrily says, \\"Then you don't know what love is!\\" before taking off with him in his car. After Nicki helps her see the truth, she accepts that he isn't treating her right and ends their relationship. When he doesn't take the break-up well, she offers for them to just be friends, but they are soon estranged when he hears that she was talking to another boy at a birthday party and slaps her again despite them no longer dating. Later that night, Bobby, accompanied by an acquaintance, Vince Fortner, convinces Stacy to get into his car for a ride. He drives to the lake and walks off with her to be alone. The next day, it is reported that she is missing. Most people guess that she hitchhiked and was murdered, but Laura suspects that Bobby has something to do with it especially after she finds Stacy's purse in his room. Nicki is also convinced that he is responsible for her disappearance and asks Carla, a witness on the night that she disappeared, for information. Her reluctance to tell what happened frustrates Nicki. Accompanied by Laura, Nicki goes to the police, informing Laura and Detective Anderson about how abusive Stacy's relationship with Bobby was. Carla eventually talks to them as well, admitting that Bobby and Vince took Stacy to the lake. Bobby and Vince are arrested and Bobby blames Stacy's disappearance on Vince. When confronted by this lie, Vince admits that Bobby was the one last seen with her, and later reveals that when he came back alone, he said that \\"if he can't have her, no one's gonna.\\" Vince is free to go, since he told Detective Anderson the truth, that he didn't know if Bobby killed Stacy. Detective Anderson is then convinced Bobby did so when she ended their relationship and refused to get back together. When he confronts him, he realizes he is cornered and shortly admits that he slit her throat when she refused to get back together with him and then disposed of her body in the lake. Stacy's body is soon found in the lake, wrapped in a trash bag with duct tape, and tied down with cinder blocks. Laura and Nicki grieve together. A court trial soon follows with the district attorney asking everyone if they ever saw Bobby hit Stacy. Carla says she did, but that it was because Stacy wouldn't listen to him. Donna and other classmates also admit that they witnessed the abuse, but figured she would leave him eventually. Val, Vince, Nicki, and Tony expose the abusive ways that Bobby treated Stacy, with Nicki saying how she desperately wanted to oust him, but was afraid of losing Stacy's friendship if she were to say what he was doing to her. He is eventually found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge tells the witnesses to tell someone next time they see a friend being abused instead of standing by and doing nothing, implying how it could have saved Stacy from getting killed. Later, a distraught Nicki cleans out Stacy's locker and cries as she looks at the pictures of them, remembering their friendship and guiltily wishing that she had acted sooner to have saved her. The film ends with Nicki and Tony leaving a bouquet of roses on the sand at the lake in memory of Stacy.

The park opened for business on June 4, 1967 originally as just a campground. It later, based upon the popularity of it as a campsite, created some water attractions for its campers to enjoy in the summer season. It is mainly popular during the summer because of its main focus on water rides. The park also contains many other attractions such as miniature golf, a ball crawl for kids, Basketball on Trampolines, a rock climbing wall, Arcade games, Jungle Themed Maze and weekend concerts. Pre-Cherry Hill Before 1967 the land was 38 acres of a working cherry farm. Some of the trees, of the over 700 there, are still cherry trees. Grant S. Lloyd, the farmer born and raised there, received the property from his father who split the property in two to both of his sons. Grant got the southern portion, that was 2 acres larger than the northern portion, when he lost a coin toss to his brother who elected to take the northern half. Grant sold the sand from the extra 2 acres to the Utah Highway Department for .02 cents a yard so they widen Highway 89 nearby. He sold it with no regrets, as the sand from the 2 acres restricted the growth of his fruit trees. He realized he could make some greater profit on his land that would give him much more money than his farm. Now that he was near a busy interstate he partnered with a Chevron gas station that was built close by and teamed up with a restaurant to be built on his property for lease. As these things occurred he and his wife planned on constructing the campground and produce even more profit. On June 4, 1967 the campground opened. Named \\"Crossroads Camping\\", it helped travelers with its food, cheap gas, and hospitality.Our Story - Cherry Hill Water Park External links and References *Official Cherry Hill Website 1967 establishments in Utah Amusement parks in Utah Buildings and structures in Davis County, Utah Tourist attractions in Davis County, Utah ","title":"Cherry Hill (amusement park)"},{"id":"23767965","text":"Three Popes and the Jews is a 1967 book by Pinchas Lapide, a former Israeli Consul to Milan, who at the time of publication was a deputy editor in the Israeli Prime Ministers press office. The \\"three popes\\" are Pope Pius XII (1939-1958), Pope John XXIII (1958-1963), and Pope Paul VI (1963-1978).  Reviews  The Catholic Herald in its review of the book observed, \\"The intentions of Mr. Lapide, deputy editor of the Prime Minister's press office in Israel and a pioneer of inter-faith relations, are so excellent that the reviewer finds it embarrassing to point out mistakes. These cast some doubt on the accuracy of the facts and figures of the rescue operations given later in great detail.\\"\\"Generous report on Church and Jews\\", The Catholic Herald, 4 August 1967, p. 6 The Roman Catholic periodical The Tablet observed \\"Embarrassed enquirers into the alleged \\"guilty silence\\" of the papacy over the Nazi extermination of the Jews have had to wait rather long for a comprehensive, well-documented and almost unreserved vindication.\\"Books of the Week, The tablet, p. 10, 6 May 1967 Rabbi David G. Dalin in The Myth of Hitler's Pope calls the book \\"meticulously researched and comprehensive\\" as well as \\"the definitive work by a Jewish scholar on the subject\\".Dalin, David G. 2005. The Myth of Hitler's Pope: How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews from the Nazis. Regnery. . p. 11. Holocaust historian Dr. Susan Zuccotti calls the work \\"consistently erroneous\\" as well as \\"replete with egregious mistakes and distortions\\".Zuccotti, 2002, p. 304. Lapide's work makes many claims to which he himself claims to have been the witness, but also makes other claims, generally without citing sources. One of Lapide's main goals as Consul to Milan was Vatican recognition of the State of Israel, and Zuccotti assesses that \\"memories of past commissions and omissions were readily sacrificed to the goal of constructing a better future\\".Zuccotti, 2002, pp. 303-304. John Cornwell states that Three Popes is a \\"formidable and scholarly riposte to those who would paint Pius XII and the Holy See as villains but it carried the taint of diplomatic self-interest\\".Cornwell, John. 1999. Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII. Viking. . p. 379. For example, the book ends with an alleged quotation from \\"Papa Roncalli\\" to Maurice Fisher, the Israeli ambassador in Rome, that \\"I would recognize the State of Israel here and now\\". Use by defenders of Pius XII The book is the source of many claims made by defenders of Pope Pius XII about his attempts to save Jews during The Holocaust. In Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy, Zuccotti traces a variety of claims by Pius XII's defenders (cited or uncited) back to Lapide.Zuccotti, 2002, pp. 71, 81, 304, 330-331, 336-337, 347, 350, 352, 364, 368. Roth and Ritner criticize defenders of Pius XII such as Rychlak, Dalin, and William Doino, for drawing on \\"problematic sources such as Pinchas Lapide\\"; they note that the book is \\"filled with errors\\" and \\"cited endlessly by papal defenders\\".Ritner, Carol and Roth, John K. (eds.). 2002. Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. New York: Leicester University Press. . pp. 215, 220. The most famous and widely quoted (and misquoted) claim of Lapide is that \\"The Catholic Church, under the pontificate of Pius XII was instrumental in saving at least 700,000 but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands\\" (pp. 214‚Äì215).S√°nchez, Jos√© M. 2002. Pius XII and the Holocaust: Understanding the Controversy. Washington D.C.: Catholic University of America Press. . pp. 139-140. Lapide claimed to have reached this number by subtracting \\"all reasonable claims of rescue made by the Protestant Churches [...] as well as those saved by Communists, self-described agnostics and other non-Christian Gentiles\\" from his estimate of 1,300,000 European Jewish survivors of the Holocaust. Lapide gives no calculation or documentation for this figure. Even Jos√© M. S√°nchez, himself a defender of Pius XII, states that \\"the undocumented calculation and suggestive wording have been ignored by Pius's defenders. Their uncritical acceptance of Lapide's statistics and statements has weakened their arguments\\". The book also contains a quotation allegedly from Pope John XXIII (well known for his own efforts to save Jews) that \\"In all these painful matters I have referred to the Holy See and simply carried out the Pope's orders: first and foremost to save human lives\\" (p. 181).Zuccotti, Susan. 2004. \\"Pope Pius XII and the Rescue of Jews in Italy: Evidence of a Papal Directive?\\". Holocaust and Genocide Studies. 18(2): 255-273. Lapide claims that Roncalli personally made this statement to him in 1957 in Venice, although there are no other witnesses. This quote is repeatedly uncritically by Ronald J. Rychlak among others, although Rychlak alters it to say \\"Jewish lives\\" instead of \\"human lives\\". Lapide also claims a similar quotation by Pope Paul VI (again repeated by Rychlak), allegedly refusing an award from an Italian Jewish delegation because \\"All I did was my duty. And besides I only acted upon orders from the Holy Father. Nobody deserves a medal for that.\\" The source for this quote is again only Lapide (p. 137), but this time he does not claim to be an eyewitness. Zuccotti regards this anecdote as unconvincing because \\"there is little evidence that [Paul VI] ever did much for the Jews\\" and the ADSS even contains examples of his refusing requests for assistance. The quote is also inconsistent with his 1963 article in The Tablet defending Pius XII which claims not that he directed others to save Jews, but that he refrained because it would have been \\"not only futile but harmful\\".
