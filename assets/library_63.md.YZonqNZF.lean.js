This is an example of a non-linear functional. The \\\\mathbb{R}.}} In mathematics, the term functional (as a noun) has at least three meanings. * In modern linear algebra, it refers to a linear mapping from a vector space V into its field of scalars, i.e., it refers to an element of the dual space V^*. * In mathematical analysis, more generally and historically, it refers to a mapping from a space X into the real numbers, or sometimes into the complex numbers, for the purpose of establishing a calculus-like structure on X. Depending on the author, such mappings may or may not be assumed to be linear, or to be defined on the whole space X. * In computer science, it is synonymous with higher-order functions, i.e. functions that take functions as arguments or return them. This article is mainly concerned with the second concept, which arose in the early 18th century as part of the calculus of variations. The first concept, which is more modern and abstract, is discussed in detail in a separate article, under the name linear form. The third concept is detailed in the article on higher- order functions. Commonly, the space X is a space of functions. In this case, the functional is a \\"function of a function\\", and some older authors actually define the term \\"functional\\" to mean \\"function of a function\\". However, the fact that X is a space of functions is not mathematically essential, so this older definition is no longer prevalent. The term originates from the calculus of variations, where one searches for a function that minimizes (or maximizes) a given functional. A particularly important application in physics is search for a state of a system that minimizes (or maximizes) the action, or in other words the time integral of the Lagrangian.  Details  =Duality= The mapping :x_0\\\\mapsto f(x_0) is a function, where is an argument of a function . At the same time, the mapping of a function to the value of the function at a point :f\\\\mapsto f(x_0) is a functional; here, is a parameter. Provided that is a linear function from a vector space to the underlying scalar field, the above linear maps are dual to each other, and in functional analysis both are called linear functionals. =Definite integral= Integrals such as :f\\\\mapsto I[f]=\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} H(f(x),f'(x),\\\\ldots)\\\\;\\\\mu(\\\\mbox{d}x) form a special class of functionals. They map a function f into a real number, provided that H is real-valued. Examples include * the area underneath the graph of a positive function f ::f\\\\mapsto\\\\int_{x_0}^{x_1}f(x)\\\\;\\\\mathrm{d}x * Lp norm of a function on a set E ::f\\\\mapsto \\\\left(\\\\int_Ef^p \\\\; \\\\mathrm{d}x\\\\right)^{1/p} * the arclength of a curve in 2-dimensional Euclidean space ::f \\\\mapsto \\\\int_{x_0}^{x_1} \\\\sqrt{ 1+f'(x)^2 } \\\\; \\\\mathrm{d}x = Inner product spaces = Given an inner product space X, and a fixed vector \\\\vec{x} \\\\in X, the map defined by \\\\vec{y} \\\\mapsto \\\\vec{x} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{y} is a linear functional on X. The set of vectors \\\\vec{y} such that \\\\vec{x}\\\\cdot \\\\vec{y} is zero is a vector subspace of X, called the null space or kernel of the functional, or the orthogonal complement of \\\\vec{x}, denoted \\\\\\\\{ \\\\vec{x} \\\\\\\\}^\\\\perp. For example, taking the inner product with a fixed function g \\\\in L^2([-\\\\pi,\\\\pi]) defines a (linear) functional on the Hilbert space L^2([-\\\\pi,\\\\pi]) of square integrable functions on [-\\\\pi,\\\\pi]: f \\\\mapsto \\\\langle f,g \\\\rangle = \\\\int_{[-\\\\pi,\\\\pi]} \\\\bar{f} g =Locality= If a functional's value can be computed for small segments of the input curve and then summed to find the total value, the functional is called local. Otherwise it is called non-local. For example: :F(y) = \\\\int_{x_0}^{x_1}y(x)\\\\;\\\\mathrm{d}x is local while :F(y) = \\\\frac{\\\\int_{x_0}^{x_1}y(x)\\\\;\\\\mathrm{d}x}{\\\\int_{x_0}^{x_1} (1+ [y(x)]^2)\\\\;\\\\mathrm{d}x} is non-local. This occurs commonly when integrals occur separately in the numerator and denominator of an equation such as in calculations of center of mass. Equation solving The traditional usage also applies when one talks about a functional equation, meaning an equation between functionals: an equation between functionals can be read as an 'equation to solve', with solutions being themselves functions. In such equations there may be several sets of variable unknowns, like when it is said that an additive function is one satisfying the functional equation :f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) . Derivative and integration Functional derivatives are used in Lagrangian mechanics. They are derivatives of functionals: i.e. they carry information on how a functional changes when the input function changes by a small amount. Richard Feynman used functional integrals as the central idea in his sum over the histories formulation of quantum mechanics. This usage implies an integral taken over some function space.

She wore the crown in 1967 coronation ceremony. Van Cleef & Arpels is a French luxury jewelry, watch, and perfume company. It was founded in 1896 by Alfred Van Cleef and his father-in-law Salomon Arpels in Paris. Their pieces often feature flowers, animals, and fairies, and have been worn by style icons such as Farah Pahlavi,The Queen of Culture, The official website of Queen Farah the Duchess of Windsor, Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Eva Per√≥n. and Queen Nazli of Egypt.  History  Alfred Van Cleef and his father-in-law, Salomon Arpels, founded the company in 1896. In 1906, following Arpels‚Äôs death, Alfred and two of his brothers-in-law, Charles and Julien, acquired space for Van Cleef & Arpels at 22 Place Vend√¥me, across from the H√¥tel Ritz, where Van Cleef & Arpels opened its first boutique shop.vancleefarpels.com The third Arpels brother, Louis, soon joined the company. Van Cleef & Arpels opened boutiques in holiday resorts such as Deauville, Vichy, Le Touquet, Nice, and Monte-Carlo. In 1925, a Van Cleef & Arpels bracelet with red and white roses fashioned from rubies and diamonds won the grand prize at the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts. Alfred and Esther‚Äôs daughter, Ren√©e (born Rachel) Puissant, assumed the company‚Äôs artistic direction in 1926. Puissant worked closely with draftsman Ren√© Sim Lacaze for the next twenty years. Van Cleef & Arpels were the first French jewelers to open boutiques in Japan and China. Compagnie Financi√®re Richemont S.A. acquired the firm in 1999. In 1966, Van Cleef & Arpels was charged with the task of making the crown of Empress Farah Pahlavi for her upcoming coronation in 1967. A team was sent to Iran to choose the major gems to use for the crown. After 11 months of work, the company presented the empress with a crown made of emerald velvet set with 36 emeralds, 36 rubies, 105 pearls and 1,469 diamonds. Van Cleef & Arpels was charged with the task of making the crown of Queen Nazli of Egypt in the 1930s  Boutiques  Van Cleef & Arpels has stores in the Middle East and South East Asia, with its products offered in standalone boutiques, boutiques within major department stores, and in independent stores. Standalone boutiques are located in Geneva, Zurich, Munich, London, Milan, Shanghai, and Paris, where the company has multiple locations, including its flagship store at Place Vend√¥me. In the United States, the company operates standalone boutiques in Boston, New York City, Beverly Hills, Chicago, Houston and Las Vegas. It also maintains stores in Naples, Palm Beach, as well as a location in Aspen. The Chicago boutique opened in 2001 at 636 North Michigan Avenue and moved to a larger location within the Drake Hotel in November 2011 while the New York City flagship store was redesigned in 2013. The brand expanded to Australia in 2016, opening a boutique at Collins Street, Melbourne. The following year, another boutique opened at Castlereagh Street, Sydney. A second Melbourne boutique is set to open in Chadstone Shopping Centre in 2018.  The Mystery Setting  On 2 December 1933, Van Cleef and Arpels received French Patent No. 764,966 for a proprietary gem setting style it calls Serti Mysterieux, or \\"Mystery Setting\\", a technique employing a setting where the prongs are invisible. Each stone is faceted onto gold rails less than two-tenths of a millimeter thick. The technique can require 300 hours of work per piece or more, and only a few are produced each year. Chaumet received an English patent for a similar technique in 1904 as did Cartier in 1933, however neither used the process as extensively.  Value  In 2010/2011, the company's estimated sales were ‚Ç¨450 million in total sales and ‚Ç¨45 million in watches.

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times. Life He was born at Valladolid, where he was educated for the priesthood. He had no vocation for the ecclesiastical state, plunged into literature, and produced a play entitled Amor y Orgullo which was acted at Toledo in 1849. To the displeasure of his father, an official in the post office, the youth refused to enter the seminary, and escaped to Madrid, where he obtained employment on the staff of El Observador, a Liberal newspaper. He afterwards founded El Bachiller Honduras, a journal in which he advocated a policy of Liberal concentration, and he attracted sufficient notice to justify his appointment as governor of Logro√±o, and his nomination as deputy for Valladolid in 1865. He was imprisoned at C√°ceres for his violent attacks on the reactionary ministry of Narv√°ez, acted as secretary to the revolutionary Junta of Catalonia when Isabella II was dethroned, and wrote the \\"Manifesto to the Nation\\" published by the provisional government on 26 October 1868. During the next few years he practically withdrew from political life till the restoration, when he attached himself to Sagasta's party. He served under Sagasta as minister for the colonies, the interior, the exchequer and education; but ill-health compelled him to resign on 27 July 1890, and henceforth he refused to take office again. He was elected to the Spanish Academy on 8 January 1874 and was appointed a life-senator in 1886. He died at Madrid in February 1903. Bust of Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce, Valladolid. N√∫√±ez de Arce first came into notice as a dramatist, and he remained faithful to the stage for nearly a quarter of a century. In addition to three plays written in collaboration with Antonio Hurtado, he produced ¬øQui√©n es el autor? (1859), La cuenta del zapatero (1859), ¬°C√≥mo se empe√±a un marido! (1860), Deudas de la honra (1863), Ni tanto ni tan poco (1865), Quien debe, paga (1867) and El haz de le√±a (1872). But N√∫√±ez de Arce's talent was more lyrical than dramatic, and his celebrity dates from the appearance of Gritos del combate (1875), a collection of poems exhorting Spaniards to lay aside domestic quarrels and to save their country from anarchy, more dangerous than a foreign foe. He maintained his position (in popular esteem) as the only possible rival of Campoamor by a series of philosophic, elegiac and symbolic poems: Raimundo Lulio, √öltima lamentaci√≥n de Lord Byron (1879), Un idilio y una eleg√≠a (1879), La selva oscura (1879) and La visi√≥n de Fray Mart√≠n (1880). The old brilliance sets off the naturalistic observation of La Pesca (1884) and La Maruja (1886). The list of his works is completed by Poemas cortos (1895) and ¬°Sursum corda! (1900); Hern√°n el lobo, published in El Liberal (January 23, 1881) and Luzbel remain unfinished. His strength lies in the graciousness of his vision, his sincerity and command of his instrument; his weakness derives from his divided sympathies, his moods of obvious sentiment and his rhetorical facility. But at his best, as in the Gritos del combate, he is a master of virile music and patriotic doctrine.

Originating in the Val di Pesa in the Chianti, they appear holding important posts in Florence in the twelfth century. In the struggles of Guelfs and Ghibellines the family was split between the Guelf factions of Cosa Nostra and Neri, of whom only the Bianchi remained in Florence. Early history From an early economic base in the Italian community of cloth merchants in Bruges, the Frescobaldi expanded their banking interests to their home city of Florence in the 13th century.Sanjay Subrahmanyam, Merchant networks in the early modern world (1996:18). Their power base in the city's affairs lay in their participation in the small network that controlled the great cloth-working Arti: the Arte della Lana, the Arte di Calimala, the guild of cloth finishers and merchants in foreign cloth, and the Cambio, or money exchange. In Florence the Frescobaldi found themselves on the wrong side in the attempted power coup of the Grandi in 1343 and were henceforth barred from public service in the Republic, but the Frescobaldi remained prominent in the lesser offices still open to them, such as podest√† in the small towns governed from Florence, and through the web of marriage connections among the Florentine ruling class. As bankers, the Frescobaldi financed ventures for numerous members of European royal families, notably their financial conquest of England, which Fernand Braudel has signalled as the greatest achievement of the Florentine firms, \\"not only in holding the purse-strings of the kings of England, but also in controlling sales of English wool which was vital to continental workshops and in particular to the Arte della Lana of Florence.\\"Braudel, The Wheels of Commerce (\\"Civilization and Capitalism\\", II) (1979) 1982:392f. In the 1270s the Frescobaldi opened an office in London and began financing the wars of King King Edward I, eventually supplanting the pioneering Riccardi of Lucca, who were driven to bankruptcy by unpaid loans made to Edward.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Frescobaldi Family The Frescobaldi were receivers of the customs of England from 1307, and also served as papal tax gatherers in England, helping to finance the Crusades.Johnson, Hugh. Vintage: The Story of Wine p.152, Simon and Schuster, 1989 With the king's death in 1307, leaving a debt to all creditors that amounted to ¬£30,000May McKisack, The Fourteenth Century (Oxford History of England) 1959 :14. Amedeo de' Frescobaldi continued in the favoured but dangerous position under Edward II; with the fall of Walter Langton, the royal treasurer, at the outset of the new reign, the bishop's debtors, many of them Italians, were instructed to render their debts to Frescobaldi; in 1309 he was granted all the wool customs from Ireland and Scotland.McKisack 1959:14. The barons' pressure against the influence of foreigners in the king's affairs, exemplified most prominently against the Gascon favourite, Piers Gaveston, swept up Frescobaldi, who at the time of the Ordinances of 1311 was ordered to tally up his accounts by October, and was arrested and all his goods seized. Frescobaldi fled England, first to Papal Avignon and then to Florence. The royal debt was never repaid, and together with other reverses in the economic downturn of the 14th century, led to the bankruptcy of the Frescobaldi. A second Frescobaldi bankruptcy, in 1581, Braudel traces to the general movement of capital and trade to the North.Braudel, The Perspective of the Wold (\\"Civilization and Capitalism\\", III) (1979) 1984:150. The family included several literary figures, including Dino Frescobaldi a poet (died c. 1316) and Leonardo Frescobaldi, who visited Egypt and the Holy Land in 1384 and wrote valuable historical accounts of the countries he visited, noting their customs, social life and economics.Frescobaldi Family Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The composer Girolamo Frescobaldi. Present day The family is currently headed by Marchese Lamberto Frescobaldi (full name: Lamberto Frescobaldi Franceschi Marini), son of Vittorio Frescobaldi Franceschi Marini. The Frescobaldi family operates the wine producer Marchesi de' Frescobaldi and is behind the Laudemio brand of Italian olive oil.

In exchange for paintings, the Frescobaldis traded their wine with the Italian Renaissance painter Michelangelo.Dayton Daily News Uncorked: Making Wine Since Before Christopher Columbus Was Born The family also supplied wine to Henry VIII; surviving contracts in the family archives are signed by the English king.Frescobaldi Article excerpt also reprinted at Etiquette Magazine The agronomist Vittorio degli Albizi was an in-law of the Frescobaldi family through the marriage of his sister Leonida to Angiolo Frescobaldi; with Frescobaldi financing he was able to pioneer modern wine production techniques in Tuscany. In 1855, Albizi introduced Chardonnay, Cabernet and Merlot vines to the region. =Partnership with Mondavi= In 1995 the Marchesi de' Frescobaldi entered into a joint venture with Robert Mondavi Winery to produce Tuscan wine. The joint venture produced several labels including Danzante, Luce della Vite, and the Wine Spectator \\"2001 Wine of the Year\\" Ornellaia. Following the acquisition of Mondavi by Constellation Brands in December 2004, the Frescobaldi family has been attempting to gain full control of the Tuscan ventures. In March 2005, the family was able to acquire control of Luce della ViteWineCountry.it (March 3, 2005) \\"Frescobaldi Acquires Control of 'Luce della Vite'\\" and Ornellaia in April 2005. =Gorgona Project= The Gorgona project began in August 2012 thanks to the partnership between Frescobaldi and Gorgona, the only island penitentiary in Europe. Here, inmates spend the final years of their sentence, working and living in close contact with nature, while developing skills to support their return to society and the workforce. In a small vineyard located in an amphitheatre-shaped area that overlooks the sea, the project aims to provide inmates with practical experience in the areas of grape cultivation and winemaking by working closely with Frescobaldi agronomists and oenologists. Today, the vineyard measures two hectares, including the original plot and a second area planted in 2015. From this vineyard of Vermentino and Ansonica grapes emerges Gorgona, the fruit of a unique location and human toil, a symbol of hope and freedom. =Tenute di Toscana= In May 2006, the Frescobaldi family merged their Tenuta dell'Ornellaia, Castel Giocondo and Luce della Vite wine holdings into a new venture partnership, Tenute di Toscana, with Stolichnaya Vodka and Michael Mondavi.Wine Business Insider (May 15, 2006) Frescobaldi Establishes Tenute di Toscana Partnership See also *History of Chianti *Gorgona Agricultural Penal Colony References Families of Florence Italian noble families ","title":"Frescobaldi"},{"id":"1374981","text":"Jason Lloyd Phillips (born September 27, 1976) is an American professional baseball player and coach.

However, after this was announced, the group went back and checked their work, and found that they had not properly removed the effects of the Earth's motion around the Sun from their analysis, and, when the calculations were redone correctly, the pulse variations that led to their conclusions disappeared, and that there was in fact no planet around PSR 1829-10.

In 1995, Jeff Goddard joined the band as bass player, and Vitt moved to second guitar. Vitt departed Karate to pursue a medical career in 1997. The band was characterised by their love for improvised music and classic rock and their adherence to the DIY punk ethos of their youth, which made them difficult to classify, being a strange fusion of indie rock, post-hardcore, punk, blues, jazz and post-rock. History Farina developed hearing problems due to twelve years of performance with Karate and was forced to disband the group in July 2005, quietly closing the door on a 12-year run that included 6 studio albums and almost 700 performances in 20 countries. Their final show was played in Rome, Italy, on July 10, 2005. Their music was primarily released on Southern Records. =Post break-up= Karate's perfectionism and attention to detail is well known among the music scene. Their compulsive behaviour manifested also in naming their last recording, which was originally called \\"594\\" since it was believed to be a recording of their 594th show. When Gavin discovered a flyer for a forgotten early show that had somehow evaded Jeff's memory, the band quickly changed the title to ‚Äò595'. Finally, In 2007, the former band members decided to release the live album 595. Often, Karate was sent live material from their own performances (often from sound technicians). This happened also after their performance on May 5 at Stuk, Leuven, Belgium. Karate was so astonished by the quality of the recording they decided to release this \\"posthumous\\" live album of their 595th live performance. On his own, Geoff Farina has also developed a solo career with three albums and a handful of EPs over the years, some released while the band was still around, and thus far one since Karate disbanded.

While being a Cossack Hetman, he transformed the Cossack Host from the erratic military formation into regular army. Under his leadership the cossacks, the Orthodox clergy and peasants had been begun to emerge as the united nation. His troops played a significant role in the battle of Khotyn against the Turks in 1621 and prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw's attempt to gain the Muscovy throne in 1618. Early life Pobuh family, to which Petro Sahaidachny belonged. Petro Konashevych Sahaidachny, Hetman of the Host of Zaporizhia Petro Konashevych was born in Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in the village of Kulchytsy (Przemy≈õl land) three miles away from Sambir in the Ruthenian Voivodeship into a Ukrainian Eastern Orthodox noble family. His father's surname was Kononovych. He graduated from Ostroh Academy in Volhynia. His school mate was Meletiy Smotrytskyi, author of the Hramatyka book, by which many generations of Ukrainians, Russians, and Belarusians learned the Slavic language grammatics. From an early age he learnt the weapon and horsemanship skills. He joined to the cossacks of Zaporozhian Host and took a part in cossack military expeditions to Moldavia in 1600 and Livonia in 1601. His talent in a military strategy, courage and ability to show leadership under great adversity and hardship were acquired by cossacks leader (otaman) Samiylo Kishka. Later, Sahaidachny moved to Lviv, and after to Kyiv, where he became the assistant and tutor of the Kyivan judge I. Aksak family. Major campaigns =Early Turkish campaign= Cossacks capturing Caffa (Feodosia). Woodcut from 1622 book By the end of the 16th century, Sahaidachny traveled to Zaporizhia, where in 1605, he was elected as a kosh otaman of the Zaporozhian Host cossacks. Under his control, the Host participated in campaigns against the Crimean Tatars and the Turks. The –°ossacks fleet captured the Turkish fortress Varna, burned and destroyed a strong Turkish navy (10,000 boats). He is famous for his sea sorties on Crimea and Turkey and in 1616 captured Caffa (Feodosia) on the Crimean peninsula, the largest center of the slave trade. He released from slavery many Christian men, women and children. =Muscovite campaign= In 1618, Sahaidachny joined the Anti-Turkish Holy League. While he was battling the Turks, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth requested his assistance for war with Muscovy (Russian Tsardom); they wanted him to provide W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa, the King of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, with 20,000 Cossacks near Moscow. Sahaidachny did, and seized the forts in the cities of Putivl, Kursk, Livny, Yelets and many others. Near Serpukhov Sahaidachny forced the Muscovite army to flee. The Muscovite troops under command of the voivode G. Volkonsky forced Cossacks to take a detour, but were unable to stop the advance of the Cossacks regiments to Moscow. In September 1618 he forced to flee the army of another Muscovite nobleman Vasilii Buturlin. Later, united army of Jan Karol Chodkiewicz and Sahaidachny sieged Moscow and 11 October unsuccessful attempted to take the Arbat Gates. In late October, the army of Sahaidachny moved in raid towards the south from Moscow. During this raid was captured the Serpukhov city and in early December the Kaluga city. John III Sobieski wrote that this successful raid caused panic among Russians and forced them to conclude negotiations as soon as possible. The whole campaign finally culminated in December 1618 by signing the Truce of Deulino, resulting in the greatest territorial expansion of the Commonwealth. The cossack's invasion of Muscovy has been described by Ukrainian historian Valery Smolyi as \\"not the best page of Sahaidachny biography\\".Valery Smolyi, Peter Sahadachny: knight, politician, man.

Sahaidachny returned to Zaporizhia, and did not only become a kosh otaman, but was also the Hetman of Ukraine. (Another source claims that in 1621 he was a colonel of the Commonwealth Registered Cossacks regiment). In order to avoid conflict with the Poles, Sahaidachny agreed to limit the Cossack register to 3,000 men, the remainder were regarded as peasants (\\"kholopy\\"). He also banned unauthorized Cossack sea raids to Turkey and the king gave Sahaidachny the right to be called an elder of the Cossacks(\\"starshina\\").

Restoration of the Ukrainian Orthodox hierarchy Not only did Sahaidachny fight for control, he also fought for the religious and cultural rights of the Ukrainian people. In 1620, he registered himself and his entire Zaporozhian Host as students into the Kyiv Epiphany Brotherhood School, that preceded the current Kyiv Mohyla Academy. It was done in order to protect the school from conversion from an Orthodox school into a Roman Catholic Jesuit Collegium. He also contributed to the establishment of a cultural center in Kyiv and sought to unite the Cossack military with the Ukrainian clergy and nobility. In early 1620 Sahaidachny sent an envoy to the Russian tsar. At this time there was the Patriarch Teophanes III of Jerusalem and this envoy held talks with him about the possibility of his arrival in the Ukraine. In 1620, Sahaidachny convinced Patriarch Teophanes III, who recently returned from Moscow, to reconstruct the Orthodox hierarchy, that was almost destroyed by the creation of the Greek- Catholic Church. Patriarch Teophanes III of Jerusalem blamed Cossacks for the participation in the Muscovy campaign saying that the damnation have been put on them for this, because Muscovites are the Orthodox Christians and in a future they never would fight again against them.Vladimir Golubutsky, Zaporozhian Cossacks, chapter IV (–í–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ì–û–õ–û–ë–£–¶–¨–ö–ò–ô, –ó–ê–ü–û–†–û–ó–¨–ö–ï –ö–û–ó–ê–¶–¢–í–û K–ò–á–í ‚Äî 1994 , –†–æ–∑–¥—ñ–ª VII, –°–û–¶–Ü–ê–õ–¨–ù–û-–ü–û–õ–Ü–¢–ò–ß–ù–ï –ô –ï–ö–û–ù–û–ú–Ü–ß–ù–ï –°–¢–ê–ù–û–í–ò–©–ï –í –£–ö–†–ê–á–ù–Ü –ù–ê–ü–†–ò–ö–Ü–ù–¶–Ü XVI‚Äî –ù–ê –ü–û–ß–ê–¢–ö–£ XVII –°–¢–û–õ–Ü–¢–¢–Ø)Valery Smolyi, Peter Sahadachny: knight, politician, man.

Because the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth had threatened to arrest Teophanes III as a spy, Sahaidachny was guaranteed his protection by the patriarch. After the new metropoliten and bishops were installed, Sahaidachny escorted the patriarch to the Ottoman border with a 3,000 men Cossack army.

Because of Sahaidachny's moderate policies towards Commonwealth, he provoked dissatisfaction among the Cossacks, and in 1620, they briefly elected Yatsko Borodavka as hetman. In 1621, the famous Battle of Khotyn had occurred, where close to 80,000 Cossacks and Polish troops fought against 160,000 Turkish army. The battle held at bay for a whole month, until the first snow compelled Osman II to withdraw his weakened forces.Valery Smolyi, Peter Sahadachny: knight, politician, man.

During the battle, Sahaidachny was seriously wounded. After the battle, the Polish king sent Sahaidachny a sword in recognition of his services. On April 20, 1622, Sahaidachny died in Kyiv from wounds he suffered at the Battle of Khotyn. He was later buried in the Bratsky Monastery of Kyiv. He left his assets to the brotherhood schools in Kyiv and Lviv for church causes. His legacy was so great, that most of the population of Kyiv attended his funeral en masse. Sahaidachny's work, About Union, was highly regarded by the Lithuanian Kanclerz Lew Sapieha. In 1646, John III Sobieski, a monarch of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, said the following about Sahaidachny: Polish historian Jan Widacki wrote that Konashevych- Sahaidachny was among Zaphorozian hetmans the one most loyal to Poland. He was a supporter of the Polish-Ukrainian military cooperation against the enemies of the Commonwealth.http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/38655,,,,konaszewicz_sahajdaczny_piotr,haslo.htmlhttp://istznu.org/dc/file.php?host_id=1&path;=/page/issues/28/./kroll.pdf Hetman Sahaydachniy is the current flagship of the Ukrainian navy.Kozhara: Hetman Sahaidachny frigate to join NATO‚Äôs anti-piracy operation, Interfax- Ukraine (17 September 2013) Legacy * Frigate \\"Hetman Sahaidachny\\" ‚Äì a flagship of the Ukrainian Navy for over 20 years. * National Ground Forces Academy in Lviv is named after hetman Petro Sahaydachyi.Germany to send military advisers to Ukraine, UNIAN (9 December 2016) * After the March 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea the monument to Konashevych-Sahaidachny in Sevastopol was removed and handed over to Kharkiv.

Purpose The Civilian Irregular Defense Group program was formed for two reasons: #U.S. mission Saigon believed that the South Vietnamese effort to create similar paramilitary units needed to be bolstered #The U.S. feared that the Viet Cong (VC) would be able to recruit large numbers of minority troops. History The CIDG program was devised by the CIA in early 1961 to counter expanding VC influence in the Central Highlands. Beginning in the village of Buon Enao, small A Teams from the US Army Special Forces (Green Berets) moved into villages and set up Area Development Centers. Focusing on local defense and civic action, the Special Forces teams did the majority of the training. Villagers were trained and armed for village defense for two weeks, while localized Strike Forces would receive better training and weapons and served as a quick reaction force to react to VC attacks. The vast majority of the CIDG camps were initially manned by inhabitants of ethnic minority regions in the country (especially Montagnard), who disliked both the North and South Vietnamese and therefore quickly took to the American advisers. The program was widely successful, as once one village was pacified, it served as a training camp for other local villages.. By 1963, the military felt that the program was a great success, but also that the CIDG units and Special Forces units were not being employed properly, and ordered Operation Switchback, which transferred control of the CIDG program from the CIA over to Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). The CIDG Program was rapidly expanded, as the entire 5th Special Forces Group, U.S. Army Special Forces, moved into Vietnam, and the CIDG units stopped focusing on village defense and instead took part in more conventional operations, most notably border surveillance. In 1966 Army Chief of Staff General Harold K. Johnson was confused and unhappy with the activities of the Special Forces in South Vietnam. They were \\"supposed to be training guerrillas,\\" he observed, \\"and what they did was build fortifications out of the Middle Ages and bury themselves... with concrete.\\" After visiting some of their more exposed Highland camps, he expressed \\"horror\\" that an organization that prided itself on being a \\"highly mobile, disdainful of fixed installations, innovative, [and] not requiring organized logistical support\\" should find itself \\"in fortified installations with mortars in concrete emplacements with fixed range cards printed on the concrete, and literally... locked in by their own actions.\\" In his estimation the CIDG program drained manpower from Saigon and was too expensive; the indigenous soldiers spent too much time protecting their own dependents who lived nearby. Furthermore, he felt that U.S. Special Forces members \\"viewed themselves as something separate and distinct from the rest of the military effort,\\" describing them as \\"fugitives from responsibility\\" who \\"tended to be nonconformist, couldn't quite get along in a straight military system, and found a haven where their actions were not scrutinized too carefully, and where they came under only sporadic or intermittent observation from the regular chain of command.\\" By 1 June 1970, the number of CIDG camps in South Vietnam had been reduced to thirty-eight, either by conversion to Regional Forces status or by closure. The South Vietnamese Joint General Staff (JGS) and the MACV staff then decided to convert the remaining camps to Ranger camps, with a target date of 31 December 1970. Progressive, concurrent conversion cycles were initiated, with the major criteria being the state of security around each camp and seasonal weather. Camps in relatively secure areas that could be supplied easily during the rainy season were converted first. Camps in less secure areas were scheduled for later conversion so that more time and resources could be applied to increasing the combat readiness of these camps. The final number of CIDG camps converted to Rangers was 37. During the stand-down period every effort was made to raise the combat readiness of the 37 remaining CIDG camps to the highest efficiency. Concurrently, a concerted effort was made to assimilate the Montagnard and other minority ethnic groups from remote areas into the ARVN. The Vietnamese Special Forces and the 5th Special Forces Croup staffs developed jointly a program designed to continue operational missions in CIDG camps; process CIDG members administratively and medically; prepare MACV advisers for camp missions; transfer logistical support; reorganize CIDG units into Ranger battalions; and assimilate CIDG leaders into the ARVN ranks. The conversion process proceeded successfully, partly because the Vietnamese Special Forces camp commanders stayed in place and automatically became Ranger battalion commanders. Their familiarity with the troops, the camp area, and the tactical area of operations was invaluable. The MACV advisers did not arrive for duty until some 17 camps had been converted. The fact that many of the advisers were former Special Forces men familiar with the camps minimized problems. As a result of the close co-ordination between U.S. and Vietnamese Special Forces, the Ranger Command was strengthened by the addition of 37 light infantry battalions. Of the possible 17,057 troop spaces scheduled for conversion 14,534 CIDG troops actually became members of the Ranger command. A significant benefit that accrued to the minority ethnic groups involved was better treatment by the government of South Vietnam. For their allegiance, as expressed by their willingness to join the ARVN units, the government provided legal birth and marriage certificates as well as medical benefits and disability pay for injuries received in military action. This was the first time that the minority groups, and particularly the Montagnards, were given full status as citizens of South Vietnam.

These conditions are typically imposed by international financial institutions or regional organizations and are intended to improve economic conditions within the recipient country. International financial institutions Conditionality is typically employed by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank or a donor country with respect to loans, debt relief and financial aid. Conditionalities may involve relatively uncontroversial requirements to enhance aid effectiveness, such as anti- corruption measures, but they may involve highly controversial ones, such as austerity or the privatization of key public services, which may provoke strong political opposition in the recipient country. These conditionalities are often grouped under the label structural adjustment as they were prominent in the structural adjustment programs following the debt crisis of the 1980s. Ex-ante vs. ex-post Much debate in types of conditionality centers around ex-ante versus ex-post conditionality. In ex-post conditionality, the country receiving aid agrees to conditions set by the donor or lender that they will carry out after they receive the aid. Later follow-ups determine whether they might receive more aid. Ex-ante conditionality requires a country to meet certain conditions and prove it can maintain them before it will receive any aid.Susan M. Collins, University of Michigan Ford School of Public Policy. Public Policy 201 Lecture on Global Poverty Traditionally, the IMF lends funds based on ex-post criteria, which might induce moral hazard behavior by the borrowing country. The moral hazard problem appears when a government behaves in a risky manner in the anticipation that it can turn to the IMF in the case of a crisis. Institutional reforms of the International Monetary Fund, such as the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) in 1999, attempt to reduce moral hazard by relying more on pre-set qualification criteria (i.e. ex-ante).Dreher, A. (2009), \\"IMF Conditionality: Theory and Evidence\\", Public Choice, 141, 233-267 'Tied' aid Other types of conditionality that often occur are aid which is tied to be used in a specific way. For example, many countries tie aid to the purchasing of domestic products, although this practice has drastically decreased over the past 15 years. The United Nations Human Development Report in 2005 estimated that only about 8 per cent of bilateral aid is 'tied', down from 27 per cent in 1990. This however varies from country to country with the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway giving 100 per cent of their aid untied, and Canada, Austria and Spain giving less than 60 per cent. European Union The European Union also employs conditionality with respect to enlargement, with membership conditional on candidate countries meeting the Copenhagen criteria and adopting the acquis communautaire.

It was created after the merger of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia. The republic was dissolved after the Polish Army took over its claimed territory of eastern Lithuania during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War.  Background  After the end of World War I in November 1918, Soviet Russia began a westward offensive following the retreating German Army. It attempted to spread the global proletarian revolution and sought to establish Soviet republics in Eastern Europe. By the end of December 1918, Bolshevik forces reached Lithuania. The Bolsheviks saw the Baltic states as a barrier or a bridge into Western Europe, where they could join the German and the Hungarian Revolutions. The Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed on 16 December 1918 and the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia was established on 1 January 1919. The two republics were weak, championed by the newly created Communist Party of Lithuania and Communist Party of Byelorussia but not enjoying public support. Faced with military setbacks in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet and Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet Wars, the Soviets decided to consolidate their efforts and the two republics were merged into Litbel on 17 February 1919. The communist parties were also merged into the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Lithuania and Belorussia.Mauro Perani, Materia giudaica. Rivista dell'Associazione italiana per lo studio del giudaismo, vol.1, Casa Editrice Giuntina, 2004, , p.289.  Short-lived state  The merger of the Lithuanian and Belarusian Soviet Republics was welcomed neither in Lithuania nor in Belarus. In particular, Belarusians perceived the merger as annexation by Lithuania and resented the exploitation of Belarusian nationalism for tactical reasons. Some Belarusian nationalists, like Zmicier Zhylunovich, resigned their posts. However, Moscow insisted and the merger was supervised by Adolph Joffe, who selected the members of the Litbel government. The new government was headed by Vincas Mickeviƒçius-Kapsukas, Chairman of the Litbel Council of People's Commissars (corresponding to prime minister) and included no Belarusians. The government was financed by loans from Russian SFSR. Historians describe it as \\"artificial creation\\" or \\"fiction\\". Litbel's capital was initially Vilnius. In April it was moved to Minsk after Vilnius was seized by the Polish Army during the Vilna offensive. Soviet premier Vladimir Lenin hoped to start peace negotiations with Poland via Polish communist Julian Marchlewski and officially liquidated Litbel on 17 July 1919. By late July 1919, almost the entire territory of Litbel was occupied by foreign armies. Minsk was taken by the Polish Army on 8 August 1919 during Operation Minsk, thus the government of Litbel ‚Äì which in fact no longer existed ‚Äì evacuated to Smolensk in August 1919.  Aftermath  In September 1919, the Soviets had already recognized independent Lithuania and offered to negotiate a peace treaty. The Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Peace Treaty was concluded on July 12, 1920. When the Polish-Soviet War turned to Soviet favor, the Soviets recaptured Minsk and recreated the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic on 31 July 1920. Despite diplomatic recognition and the peace treaty, the Soviets planned a coup to overthrow the Lithuanian government and re-establish the Soviet republic. However, Soviets lost the Battle of Warsaw and were pushed back by the Poles. Some historians credit this victory for saving Lithuania's independence from the Soviet coup. The Polish‚ÄìRussian border was determined by the Peace of Riga, which left just about half of the Belarusian territory to Byelorussian SSR.

It was named after Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in Western Europe, which marks the border between France and Piedmont. It was formed in 1792, when the Savoy region, (part of the Kingdom of Sardinia) was occupied by the French. The department ceased to exist following Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo; the territory was restored to its former rulers. Chronology During the night of 21 September 1792, French troops under General Moutesquiou launched a surprise attack on the Duchy of Savoy, which at the time was a dependent territory of the Kingdom of Sardinia. The king, who was in residence at Chamb√©ry, accompanied by his army, numerous administrators and clergy, fled across the Alps to his Piedmontese lands. At the end of October, the so-called Assembly of the Allobroges (who named themselves after an ancient people thought to have occupied the region two thousand years earlier) convened in the cathedral at Chamb√©ry. Their agenda followed the revolutionary script that by now was becoming familiar across France, as they declared an end to despotism, forced labour and the hated salt tax. The meeting was dissolved on 29 October 1792, but not before passing a resolution expressing the wish for The Duchy of Savoy to be incorporated into revolutionary France. Two deputies, named Fran√ßois Am√©d√©e Doppet and Simond, were mandated to convey this wish to the revolutionary National Convention in Paris. The next month, on 27 November 1792, the Savoyards became, for the next 23 years, French citizens, by means of the Decree covering the joining of Savoy to France. This document also created the department of Mont-Blanc. In 1798, after the French took Geneva, the northern part of the department of Mont-Blanc was transferred to the new department of L√©man. After the first defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814, France lost Geneva. The formerly French department of L√©man disappeared, and the department of Mont-Blanc seems to have been restored with approximately the frontiers established in 1792. Although the department remained French territory under the terms of the 1814 Treaty of Paris, harsher terms were imposed on France after Napoleon's escape from his Elban exile, and under the 1815 Treaty of Paris the territory covered by the department of Mont-Blanc was returned to its former rulers, and integrated back into the Kingdom of Sardinia. A little less than half a century later, under the terms of the Treaty of Turin, Savoy was reintegrated into France as part of a deal between the leaders of the French government and the Piedmontese government, this being the price of French support for the unification of Italy under Piedmontese leadership. However, the department of Mont-Blanc was not reinstated. Instead, the territory that it had formerly covered was divided between the newly created departments of Savoie and Haute-Savoie (partly). Administration The capital of the department of Mont-Blanc was Chamb√©ry. The department was subdivided into the following arrondissements and cantons (situation in 1812):Almanach Imp√©rial an bissextil MDCCCXII, pp. 437‚Äì438, accessed in Gallica 26 July 2013 * Chamb√©ry, cantons: Aix, La Biolle, Chamb√©ry (2 cantons), Le Ch√¢telard, Les √âchelles, L'H√¥pital, Montm√©lian, Novalaise, Le Pont-de-Beauvoisin, La Rochette, Ruffieux, Saint-Genix, Saint- Pierre-d'Albigny and Yenne. * Annecy, cantons: Annecy (2 cantons), Faverges, Rumilly and Th√¥nes. * Mo√ªtiers, cantons: Beaufort, Bourg-Saint-Maurice, Conflans and Mo√ªtiers (2 cantons). * Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, cantons: Aiguebelle, La Chambre, Lanslebourg, Modane, Saint-√âtienne-de-Cuines, Saint- Jean-de-Maurienne (2 cantons) and Saint-Michel.

Before the merger there were two junior highs and only one public high school. After the merger an extra high school was created to control traffic and provide a geographically friendly design. Before the merger the only high school was situated on only one part of the city making educational equity hard for those who live in the far western part of the city. With the merger a high school was for the first time, right in the neighborhood for residents who live in the west. There was also the opening of PACI (previously a junior high) as a high school, which has a perfectly central location. This new system has made school more accessible for some who might have found attending difficult in the first place. Also with the rural school being open on the west, there was a new tool for community workers. Due to the separate school divisions communication was difficult between institutions who resided in the same neighborhood. These schools are located in a neighborhood that ranges drastically from low living standards, to normal living standards. With the homogenization of these institutions which find themselves surrounded by some of the same social problems, and the transfer of these schools from normal institutions to community based institutions, the workers of these communities can create a web of support, and deal with matters with a newfound urgency that was lacking before. This is one of the strengths of having a larger school division. There is a larger base of power and decision makers to help smooth out the imperfections.

It served the consumer DIY market sector, and most stores had some form of garden centre. At its peak in 2002, it was the second largest DIY retailer in the United Kingdom, although by 2011, it was the fourth. The main competitors were B&Q;, Homebase and Wickes. The company operated 178 stores in the United Kingdom with 3,000 employees, but had been running losses every year since 2007. In the year up to 2011, the company had a loss of ¬£25 million.Ernst & Young. Administrators' Statement of Proposal. 24 June 2011 On 4 May 2011, the Focus Group announced that it was going to enter administration; the following group companies went into administration: Focus (DIY) Limited, Focus (Investments) Limited, Payless DIY Limited, Payless Properties Limited, Do It All Limited and Do It All (Holdings) Limited. The company entered administration on 5 May 2011, with Ernst & Young appointed as administrators. As no buyer was found for the chain as a whole, the company was put into a wind down process. During this period, the administrators sold 55 stores to B&Q;, Wickes and B&M; Bargains. The remaining 123 stores were closed, in intervals, beginning on 9 June 2011, until the final closures on 22 July 2011. History The company had its origins in the beginning of the 1980s, when Mike Williams launched Focus Homecentres for AAH Holdings plc. In December 1987, Focus Homecentres was acquired by Choice Group Ltd.Letter dated 23 December 1987 from Choice Group Limited to Mr M J Williams The new company's shareholders included Mike Williams, Bill Archer and Greg Stanley, who had previously built up and sold the DIY chain Fads. Focus increased its market share with a mix of both acquisitions and organic growth. This included the purchase of the Do It All DIY chain from Boots in August 1998. Until 2001, both chains were rebranded as Focus Do It All. The company added a further 131 stores, with the purchase of Wickes in September 2000, a no frills DIY chain which focused on building supplies to the trade. This was whilst the existing Focus company had targeted the consumer end of the market. The two store formats were thought to complement each other, and so were retained as separate entities. The group became known as Focus Wickes. The company also considered acquiring Homebase, but decided against it. In December 2000, the group expanded again, with the purchase of the Great Mills chain, from RMC Group. Another 98 stores were added to the portfolio. The majority of these stores were re branded as Focus, except for some larger stores which became Wickes. By 2002, through rapid expansion and acquisition, Focus had become the second biggest DIY chain in Britain with 430 stores and sales of over ¬£1.66 billion. In December 2004, the Wickes business and stores were sold to Travis PerkinsFocus DIY sold for ¬£1. The Guardian for ¬£950 million, making a tidy return on the ¬£350 million initial investment. The sale was completed in February 2005. By January 2007, it was clear that the company had run into financial difficulties; it was close to breaching its banking covenants, and struggling under debts built up over the acquisition spree in the preceding years. The DIY market as a whole had experienced a two-year drop in sales. and Focus blamed \\"challenging\\" market conditions for the difficulties.Focus DIY falls into administration as debt crisis mounts The Independent Focus appointed bankers Rothschild to advise it on a potential sale of the business. =The \\"new\\" Focus= Focus DIY, Keighley, West Yorkshire (2010) Cerberus Capital purchased Focus DIY for ¬£1 in June 2007, and appointed Bill Grimsey, formerly CEO of Wickes, as CEO. In an attempt to tackle the financial problems the owners restructured the business, and injected fresh capital in the form of ¬£200 million via loans by the owners Cerberus Capital, Bank of Scotland and GMAC. Costs were slashed, and under performing stores were either closed or sold to other retailers, including Homebase, Tesco, Wickes and Sainsbury's. A programme of new store formats and further cost cutting was undertaken in 2009. In February 2011, Asda announced the purchase of six stores from Focus DIY, which were converted into supermarkets later that year. By January 2011, the number of stores had gradually been reduced from 256 in 2007 to 178. =Supply chain= In November 2008, Focus had one main distribution centre, in Tamworth, which was acquired with Do It All in August 1998. The closure of the Severnside distribution centre was announced in October 2008, citing adverse financial circumstances. =Administration= Focus DIY, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire (2009) In August 2009, Focus narrowly avoided administration, when BDO Insolvency practitioners achieved a company voluntary arrangement. This was to restructure, and repay debts over a contracted period of time. On 5 May 2011, it was announced that owners Cerberus Capital had placed Focus into administration, after failed attempts to find a rescue deal. Ernst & Young placed Simon Allport, Alan Hudson and Tom Jack as joint administrators at midnight. On 6 May 2011, it was announced that B&Q; had bought 31 stores in cash for ¬£23 million, with a plan to refit the properties and reopen them as B&Qs; by July 2011, with Focus employees transferring to the stores. Ernst & Young announced the closure of the remaining stores, which were over 120, which resulted in up to 3,000 job losses. At the time of the appointment of the administrators, the 178 strong retail chain collapsed owing businesses, shareholders and funders around ¬£1 billion. The sale of assets generated ¬£70 million, leaving most creditors out of pocket, including HMRC. On 22 July 2011, the final store, which was in Gillingham, ceased trading. In December 2011, the brand was bought by the Walker Group, which owns Victoria Plumb.

The circuit, built around the base of an extinct volcano, was known for its challenging layout which favored the most skillful drivers and motorcyclists. It hosted the French Grand Prix four times and the French motorcycle Grand Prix ten times. Circuit history There had been local interest in motorsport racing beginning with proposals in 1908 for a race on a street circuit, although the proposals were never enacted. Efforts were renewed after the Second World War when the President of the Sports Association of the Automobile Club of Auvergne, Jean Auchatraire, and accomplished racer Louis Rosier designed a course by adapting pre-existing roads around the Puy de D√¥me, an extinct volcano which dominated the city skyline. Construction began in May 1957 and the first race was held in July 1958 when an endurance race was won by Innes Ireland in a Lotus 1100, and a Formula Two race won by Maurice Trintignant in a Cooper T43. Originally, the 8.055 km (5.005-mi) long circuit was described as an even twistier and faster version of the N√ºrburgring. With a relentless number of sharp curves and elevation changes and with almost no discernible straights, the circuit was both feared and respected by competitors. The sinuous track layout caused some drivers like Jochen Rindt in the 1969 French Grand Prix to complain of motion sickness, and wore open face helmets just in case. Despite the numerous curves, the track was relatively fast with Chris Amon setting the lap record in a Matra MS120 with a 104 mph average during the 1972 French Grand Prix. In his 1969 book Motor Cycle Racing, Peter Carrick wrote: > The French Grand Prix circuit at Clermont Ferrand was seen to be in complete > contrast to the lap at Monza, when it was first used in 1959: the longest > straight was 650 yards and a variety of really tight corners quickly > demonstrated‚Äîor exposed‚Äîa rider's skill!Carrick, Peter Motor Cycle Racing > Hamlyn Publishing 1969/70 p.91 Accessed 2013-07-30 The venue first gained international prominence when it hosted the French motorcycle Grand Prix in 1959, won by John Surtees riding an MV Agusta. The circuit would host the French motorcycle Grand Prix ten times between 1959 and 1974. In 1959, Stirling Moss competed on the track for the first time and declared: \\"I don't know a more wonderful track than Charade\\". Also in 1959, Ivor Bueb winner of the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans, died following a crash at the Charade Circuit. The death would mark the only driver fatality at the circuit. The only motorcyclist fatality occurred when Marcelin Herranz was killed on June 1, 1963 during the 250cc race of the French motorcycle Grand Prix. The 1964 Troph√©es d'Auvergne Formula 2 race podium was a sign of things to come: Denny Hulme, Jackie Stewart and Jochen Rindt showed their skill before the circuit hosted its first Formula 1 race when Jim Clark won the 1965 French Grand Prix for Team Lotus. In 1965, John Frankenheimer filmed a small part of his movie Grand Prix in front of 3000 locals, who posed as race spectators watching actors like Yves Montand and Fran√ßoise Hardy. In total four Formula One French Grand Prix were held at Charade, in 1965, 1969, 1970 and 1972. While the circuit's natural setting created conditions for a sinuous, challenging race course, it also created safety concerns due to the dark, volcanic rocks which fell from the mountain onto both sides of the track. The rocks meant that tire punctures were a perennial hazard at the Charade Circuit, as was shown when 10 competitors suffered punctures during the 1972 French Grand Prix. Drivers who skirted the track edge would send rocks flying in the middle of the road and into the path of pursuing competitors. In the most serious incident at the 1972 French Grand Prix, a stone thrown from Emerson Fittipaldi's Lotus penetrated the helmet visor of Helmut Marko, blinding him in the left eye and ending his racing career. The mountainous topography also left no room to provide safe run-off areas in the event of competitors losing control of their vehicles and unintentionally leaving the race course. The venue became increasingly shunned by international racing series as concerns about the public roads' dangerous nature rose. In 1971, the newly built and much safer Circuit Paul Ricard held the French Grand Prix for the first time, before becoming the event's permanent home from 1973 to 1990, alternating the French Grand Prix with the Circuit Dijon-Prenois. It continued to host smaller motorsports competitions such as Formula 3, sports car racing, touring car racing, rallying and hillclimbing as well as the Troph√©es d'Auverne. In 1980, three track marshals were killed at a touring car race, and in 1984 there was a drivers protest over track safety. Faced with increasing safety issues and with the natural topography preventing any chance of adding run-off areas, the final race on the original 8 km track was held on September 18, 1988.  Modernization  The modern 3.975 km circuit, first used in 1989 The General Council of Puy-de- D√¥me recognized the importance of the race track to the local economy and financed the building of a new 3.975 km (2.47-mi) circuit utilising only the southern portion of the original, with a new link road completing the circuit. The new Circuit de Charade opened in 1989 hosting national championship races in the 1994 French Supertouring Championship and the 1998 FFSA GT Championship. Currently, the venue holds events such as track days, driving courses as well as historic motorsport events. In 2000, the roads were closed to the public, with the track becoming a truly permanent facility with new pit garages and a widened pit lane. The original sections of the 8 km street circuit are still in use as public roadways.

Army Army Career Counselor Badge The Army Career Counselor Badge is authorized for wear by enlisted service members who hold the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS's) of ‚Äú79S, 79T or 79V‚Äù, that of Career Counselor. The badge is presented as an Army Identification Badge to all graduates of the nine-week Army Career Counselor Course conducted at Ft Knox, KY, who subsequently are assigned as Career Counselors or Reenlistment Advisors, in the case of the National Guard. After a twelve month probationary period, the Career Counselor Badge is authorized for permanent wear providing that service as a Career Counselor was satisfactory and free from disciplinary action or removal for cause. The badge is worn on the right side of the uniform. The Army Career Counselor Badge is retroactive to January 1972 and may be awarded for past service upon application from the service member. The badge may also be worn by officers, if they held an MOS as Career Counselor during enlisted service. The Army Career Counselor Badge was awarded to Soldier's upon completion of training for the Military Occupational Specialty of 00R with the Army's Rectuiting and Retention School located at Fort Benjamin Harrison, IN. Military Occupational Specialty 00R was a combined specialty consisting of Recruiters and Career Counselors, the badge awarded by the Commandant was determined by which training track of the occupational specialty the Soldier completed. In 1993 Military Occupational Specialty 00R was split to 79R for Recruiters, 79S for Active Duty Career Counselors, 79V for U.S. Army Reserve Career Counselors, and 79T for Army National Guard Career Counselors. Navy Navy Career Counselor Badge The Navy Career Counselor Badge is a temporary insignia which is presented by local commands to those personnel, E-5 or above, who have been assigned as the Command Career Counselor. Personnel assigned to such duties must have completed appropriate Navy schooling and hold a Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) as a Career Counselor or be in the Navy Counselor (NC) rating. Personnel that are E-5 may apply to enter the Navy Counselor (Career) rating once they are available to take First Class Petty Officer exam, but even Navy Counselors may only wear this badge when actually serving as a Command Career Counselor. The badge may also be worn by commanding officers and executive officers at the discretion of the commanding officer, and by officers designated full-time retention officers on the staffs of the Chief of Naval Operations, fleet commanders-in-chief, and type commanders. In actual practice some Commanding Officers have required all Lieutenant Commanders and/or department heads in a command to wear this badge in their capacity as counselors to junior officers, while other commands have required its wear by all officers serving as an Officer-in-Charge of a deployed detachment . The Navy Career Counselor Badge may only be worn while actually serving as a Career Counselor (or in another authorized billet as noted above); however, there have been cases where the award has been entered in service records as a permanent insignia. This is usually the case for Career Counselors of the larger or higher echelon Navy commands, where such permanent bestowal of the Career Counselor Badge was authorized by a senior officer O-6 or above. The Navy Career Counselor Badge is typically worn either attached directly to a uniform or suspended on a leather backing from a pocket button. This second method is actually in violation of Navy uniform regulations; however, a flexible view of uniform regulations is relatively common in certain Navy commands.

A full 20 years after the first of those successes, Darragh was on the team that won the trophy again in 1997, his last major win on an Irish team. Other highlights included wins in the Hickstead Derby on Pele and the Dublin Grand Prix on Carrolls Trigger. In total, he represented Ireland 54 times in Nations Cups.

He participated in the bombing of the Amsterdam public records office to hinder the Nazi German effort to identify Dutch Jews and others wanted by the Gestapo. Arondeus was caught and executed soon after his arrest. Yad Vashem recognized Arondeus as Righteous Among the Nations. Arondeus was openly gay before the war and defiantly asserted his sexuality before his execution. His final words were: \\"Tell the people that homosexuals are not by definition weak.\\" Biography =Early life= Willem Johan Cornelis Arondeus was born in Naarden, as the youngest son of an Amsterdam fuel trader. His parents were Hendrik Cornelis Arondeus and Catharina Wilhelmina de Vries. He started working as an illustrator, designer of posters and tapestries and a painter. In 1923 he was commissioned to paint a large mural for Rotterdam City Hall. During that same period, he illustrated poems by J. H. Leopold, Pieter Cornelis Boutens and Martinus Nijhoff. He admired the older Dutch designer Richard Roland Holst, as can be seen in his work. He did not attain much fame and lived in impoverished circumstances. Arondeus on holiday on the island of Urk, 1921. Around 1935, he gave up visual arts and became an author. The poems and stories he had written in the 1920s went unpublished, but in the year 1938 he published two novels, Het Uilenhuis ('The Owls House') and In de bloeiende Ramenas ('In the Blossoming Winter Radish'), both illustrated with designs by Arondeus himself. The year 1939 saw the publication of his best work, Matthƒ≥s Maris: de tragiek van den droom ('The Tragedy of the Dream'), a biography of the painter Matthijs Maris, who was a brother of the Dutch artists Jacob and Willem Maris. Two years later, Figuren en problemen der monumentale schilderkunst in Nederland ('Figures and Problems of Monumental Painting in the Netherlands') was published, again with designs by the author. At that date, however, Arondeus was already involved with the Dutch resistance movement. =Resistance movement= In 1942, Arondeus started an underground periodical called the Brandarisbrief. In 1943, the Brandarisbrief merged with another publication called De Vrije Kunstenaar Through the merger, Arondeus met Gerrit van der Veen, the editor of De Vrije Kunstenaar. In the resistance, Gerrit van der Veen specialized in forging identity cards. As a result, Arondeus also became involved in creating forged documents, along with lesbian resistant Frieda Belinfante. A major detriment to the success of these forgeries was the Municipal Office for Population Registration as its existence made the forgeries less useful, since their legitimacy could be checked against the registration lists and determined to be fakes. Arondeus and van der Veen, developed a plan to destroy the registration office along with a number of associates. Their attack, which took place on 27 March 1943, was partially successful, and they managed to destroy 800,000 identity cards (15% of the records\\"De aanslag op het Amsterdamse bevolkingsregister\\", Verzetsmuseum (Dutch)), and retrieve 600 blank cards and 50,000 guilders. The building was blown up and no one was caught on the night of the attack. However, due to an unknown betrayer, Arondeus was arrested on 1 April 1943. Arondeus refused to give up the rest of his team but his notebook was found, and as a result, a majority of the group were arrested as well. On 18 June 1943, Arondeus was tried and sentenced to death, along with 13 other men who participated. Two of the group received clemency, but the others were executed on 1 July 1943. Ardoneus pleaded guilty and took the full blame, which may be why two young doctors were spared from execution and given custodial sentences instead. Before his execution, Arondeus made a point of ensuring the public would be aware that he and two other men in the group, Bakker and Brouwer, were gay, asking either a friend or his lawyer (accounts vary) to: \\"Tell the people that homosexuals can be brave!\\" https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/id-card/willem-arondeus  Legacy  In 1945, after the liberation of the Netherlands, Arondeus's family was awarded a posthumous medal by the Dutch government in his honor. In 1984, he was awarded the Resistance Memorial Cross. Further, on 19 June 1986, Yad Vashem recognized Arondeus as Righteous Among the Nations.

From the late 1930s, he developed increasingly strident antisemitic views. In 1940, after his involvement with a suspected spy at the United States embassy, he became the only British MP to be interned under Defence Regulation 18B. Family and early life Ramsay was from a Scottish aristocratic family; his grandfather was Sir Henry Ramsay, younger brother of George Ramsay, 12th Earl of Dalhousie. He attended Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, joining the Coldstream Guards in 1913.London Gazette Issue 28756. 16 September 1913. Page 5. After the outbreak of World War I, he served in France for two years. He received a severe head injury before being invalided out and transferred to the War Office in London. Here he met and married on 30 April 1917 Lady Ninian Crichton-Stuart, n√©e Hon. Ismay Preston, daughter of Viscount Gormanston and widow of Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart MP, who had been killed on active service in the war. His wife was the mother of three surviving children. The couple later had four sons together; the eldest died on active service in 1943. As the war was coming to an end, Ramsay served at the British War Mission in Paris. He retired from the Army with the rank of Captain in 1920. He spent the 1920s as a company director, near Arbroath, Angus, and became active in the Conservative Party. In the 1931 general election, Ramsay was elected as MP for Peebles and Southern Midlothian. He was not considered a potential candidate for high office; the most senior appointment he obtained was as a Government member of the Potato Marketing Board. Spanish Civil War After the Spanish Civil War broke out, Ramsay became a strong supporter of the Nationalists under Francisco Franco, largely arising out of his opposition to the violent anti-clericalism of the Spanish Republicans and their attacks on the Roman Catholic Church. In the early months of the war, he objected in Parliament to what he saw as bias in BBC news reports on Spain; he pointed to links between Spanish Republicans and the Soviet Union. Late in 1937, Ramsay formed the 'United Christian Front' to combat attacks on Christianity \\"which emanate from Moscow\\". Many distinguished peers and churchmen joined, but the organisation was criticised in a letter to The Times by senior religious figures, including William Temple (Archbishop of York) and Donald Soper. The objectors said that while they supported Christian unity, they could not support the United Christian Front, as it was mainly concerned with the Spanish Civil War and \\"adopts a view of it which seems to us ill-founded\\". Ramsay became aware of a plan to hold a conference of freethinkers in London in 1938, which was being organised by the International Federation of Freethinkers. Together with his supporters in Parliament, he denounced this as a \\"Godless Conference\\", organised by a Moscow-based organisation. On 28 June 1938, he asked for permission to introduce as a Private Member's Bill the \\"Aliens Restriction (Blasphemy) Bill\\" to prohibit conference attendees from entering Britain; he won the vote by 165 to 134, but the bill went no further. Ramsay's opposition to communism led him to look to other countries for examples. On 13 January 1938, he had given a speech to the Arbroath Business Club in which he observed that Adolf Hitler's antipathy to Jews arose from his knowledge \\"that the real power behind the Third International is a group of revolutionary Jews\\". Some time later in 1938, he read The Rulers of Russia by a reactionary Roman Catholic priest from Ireland, Father Denis Fahey, which contended that of 59 members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1935, 56 were Jews, and the remaining three were married to Jews. At the same time, Ramsay was becoming ever more sympathetic to Germany; in September, he wrote to The Times to defend the right of the Sudetenland to self- determination. On 15 November 1938, Ramsay was invited to a luncheon party at the German Embassy in London, where he met British sympathisers with Nazi Germany, including Barry Domvile. In December he introduced another Private Member's Bill called the \\"Companies Act (1929) Amendment Bill\\", which would require shares in news agencies and newspapers to be held openly and not through nominees. In his speech promoting the Bill, Ramsay claimed the press was being manipulated and controlled by \\"international financiers\\" based in New York City who wanted to \\"thrust this country into a war\\". Ramsay was given permission to introduce his Bill by 151 to 104; again it went no further. Controversy On 10 January 1939 the Hon. Mrs Ismay Ramsay gave another speech to the Arbroath Business Club, at which she claimed the national press was \\"largely under Jewish control\\", that \\"an international group of Jews ... were behind world revolution in every single country\\" and that Hitler \\"must ... have had his reasons for what he did\\". The speech was reported in the local newspaper and attracted the attention of the rabbi of the Edinburgh Hebrew Congregation, Dr Salis Daiches, who wrote to The Scotsman challenging Mrs Ramsay to produce evidence. Ramsay wrote on her behalf citing Father Fahey's booklet, and the resulting correspondence lasted for nearly a month-- including a letter from eleven ministers of the Church of Scotland in the County of Peebles repudiating the views of their MP. Some members of Ramsay's local Conservative Association in Peebles were not pleased by what they considered negative publicity. However, Ramsay reassured them that he would continue to be a supporter of Neville Chamberlain and the National Government. Ramsay made attempts to make controversial speeches to private meetings rather than in public. On 27 April he spoke to a branch of the (antisemitic) Nordic League in Kilburn, London, attacking Neville Chamberlain for introducing conscription \\"at the instigation of the Jews\\" and claiming that the Conservative Party \\"relies on ... Jew money\\". The Right Club After the controversy over Mrs Ramsay's January speech died down, Ramsay decided to influence others so that they would rid the Conservative Party of its alleged Jewish control. To this end he set up the Right Club in May 1939, noting down those who had joined in a red leather-bound and lockable ledger (the \\"Red Book\\"). There were 135 names on the men's list and 100 on a separate ladies' list; the members of the Right Club include a broad spectrum of those known to be antisemitic (including William Joyce and the Member of Parliament John Hamilton Mackie), those who were in some respects \\"fellow travellers\\" with antisemitism, and some friends of Ramsay who may have joined without knowing the actual functions of the club. At its early meetings, the 5th Duke of Wellington took the chair. While Ramsay was attempting to launch the Right Club, he spoke at a meeting of the Nordic League at the Wigmore Hall at which a reporter from the Daily Worker was present and reported Ramsay as saying that they needed to end Jewish control, \\"and if we don't do it constitutionally, we'll do it with steel\\" ‚Äì a statement greeted with wild applause. The popular magazine John Bull picked up on the report and challenged Ramsay to contradict it or explain himself. Ramsay's local constituency newspaper, the Peeblesshire Advertiser, made the same challenge and Ramsay responded by admitting he had made the speech, citing the fact that three halls had refused to host the meeting as evidence of Jewish control. Outbreak of war On the second day of the Second World War, 4 September 1939, Ramsay sat in the library of the House of Commons writing a parody of Land of Hope and Glory, beginning: \\"Land of dope and Jewry\\". When the Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha (a frequent target of antisemitism) was forced out of office, Ramsay distributed in the House of Commons many copies of 'Truth' (a magazine closely connected to Neville Chamberlain) which argued that Hore-Belisha was no loss to the government. He also put down a motion which cited the regretful reactions of many newspapers to Hore-Belisha's sacking as evidence of Jewish control of the press. Privately, Ramsay had been invited to some of the \\"Secret Meetings\\" at which right-wing opponents of the war discussed tactics. However, after they came to be dominated by Sir Oswald Mosley and his supporters, Ramsay withdrew. The Right Club spent the Phoney War period distributing propaganda in the form of leaflets and 'sticky-backs' (adhesive labels containing slogans), with Ramsay later explaining that he wanted \\"to maintain the atmosphere in which the \\"Phoney War\\", as it was called, might be converted into an honourable negotiated peace.\\" In addition to Ramsay's \\"Land of dope and Jewry\\"' rhyme, the slogans included \\"War destroys workers\\" and \\"This is a Jews' War\\". Some of the leaflets asserted \\"the stark truth is that this war was plotted and engineered by the Jews for world-power and vengeance\\".Richard Griffiths, \\"Patriotism Perverted\\", Constable, 1998, p. 237, citing The National Archives file HO 144/22454/109. House of Commons In Parliament, Ramsay attacked the internment procedure of Defence Regulation 18B and opposed the arrest of antisemitic speaker Richard A. V. \\"Jock\\" Houston under the Public Order Act 1936. On 20 March 1940, he asked a question about a propaganda radio station set up by Germany which gave its precise wavelength, which was suspected by both his allies and opponents as a subtle way of advertising it. On 9 May he asked for an assurance from the Home Secretary \\"that he refuses to be stampeded ... by a ramp in our Jew-ridden press?\\" His increasingly open antisemitism was picked up by Labour members and others and referred to in debate. Internment One of the last members to join the Right Club was Tyler Kent, a cypher clerk at the Embassy of the United States in London. Ramsay gave Kent the ledger containing the list of Right Club members for safe-keeping. Kent was stealing top-secret documents from the embassy and had already fallen under suspicion. On 20 May, after the US ambassador had agreed to waive Kent's diplomatic immunity, his flat was raided and he was arrested; the locked Red Book was forced open. Ramsay's involvement with Kent was extremely worrying to the authorities, as Ramsay enjoyed parliamentary privilege; if Kent had given the stolen documents to Ramsay and he had spoken about them in Parliament, it would have been impossible to prevent their publication. The Cabinet decided to extend Defence Regulation 18B to give more power to detain people suspected of disloyalty. Ramsay was arrested and lodged in Brixton Prison on an order under Regulation 18B on 23 May 1940. He engaged solicitors (Oswald Hickson, Collier & Co.) through whom he attempted to defend his reputation. When Lord Marley said in the House of Lords that Ramsay was Hitler's chosen Gauleiter for Scotland in the event of an invasion, Oswald Hickson, Collier immediately sent off a letter of complaint. As an 18B detainee, Ramsay's only lawful method of challenging his detention was to appeal to the Advisory Committee under Norman Birkett, but that recommended his continued detention. However, some of Ramsay's colleagues argued that as he was a Member of Parliament his detention was a breach of parliamentary privilege. The detention was referred to the Committee of Privileges, but on 9 October the committee reported that the detention was not a breach of privilege. Libel trial The New York Times published an article on \\"Britain's Fifth Column\\" in July 1940 which claimed \\"informed American sources said that he had sent to the German legation in Dublin treasonable information given to him by Tyler Kent\\". Ramsay sued for libel, resulting in a trial in July 1941. He asserted his loyalty to Britain. However, some of Ramsay's answers did him damage; for example when asked if he wanted Nazism to be defeated, he replied, substituting \\"Germany\\" for \\"Nazism\\"; \\"Not only Germany, but also the Judaic menace\\". In summing-up, the judge said he was convinced Hitler would call Ramsay \\"friend\\" and that Ramsay was disloyal in heart and soul to his King, his Government, and the people. However, The New York Times could not defend its story, having found no evidence that Ramsay had communicated anything to the German legation, and it was found guilty. The judge awarded a farthing (¬ºd) in damages, the customary award for a libel plaintiff who technically won a case, but was adjudged to have brought his trouble on himself. If the defendant in a libel case pays into court beforehand a sum not less than the damages ultimately awarded, he is not liable for costs; as The New York Times had paid ¬£75 into court, Ramsay became liable for both prosecution and defence costs. Another consequence of the trial was that Ramsay's local Unionist Association disowned him and asked another Member of Parliament, David Robertson, to undertake Ramsay's constituency work. Subsequent political activity Ramsay continued occasionally to put down written parliamentary questions from jail, sometimes taking up the cases of fellow 18B internees. His eldest son Alec, serving in the Scots Guards, died of pneumonia on active service in South Africa in August 1943. Ramsay was finally released from detention on 26 September 1944, being one of the last few 18B detainees. He immediately returned to Westminster to resume his seat in the Commons, causing at least one member to walk out of the chamber. His only significant action in the remainder of the parliament was a motion calling for the reinstatement of the 1275 Statute of the Jewry passed under King Edward I. He did not defend his seat in the 1945 general election. In 1952, Ramsay wrote The Nameless War as an autobiography and a plea to justify his actions. Much of the book consisted of an antisemitic conspiracy theory interpreting the English, French, Russian and Spanish Revolutions as part of a Jewish campaign for world domination. It quoted extensively from The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the authenticity of which Ramsay took for granted, and added assertions including that Calvin had been a Jew whose real name was \\"Cohen\\", that Cromwell had been \\"a paid agent of the Jews\\" and that the entire English Civil War and the execution of Charles I were staged for the sole purpose of allowing Jews to return to England. The book is still current in extreme-right circles. Ramsay attended some far-right political meetings but did not attract attention. He died in 1955.

It‚Äôs basically about being both saddened by and appreciative of transience ‚Äì and also about the relationship between life and death. In Japan, there are four very distinct seasons, and you really become aware of life and mortality and transience. You become aware of how significant those moments are.‚Äù Origins The term comes from Heian period literature, but was picked up and used by 18th century Edo period Japanese cultural scholar Motoori Norinaga in his literary criticism of The Tale of Genji, and later to other seminal Japanese works including the Man'y≈çsh≈´. It became central to his philosophy of literature and eventually to Japanese cultural tradition. Etymology The phrase is derived from the Japanese word , which means \\"thing\\", and , which was a Heian period expression of measured surprise (similar to \\"ah\\" or \\"oh\\"), translating roughly as \\"pathos\\", \\"poignancy\\", \\"deep feeling\\", \\"sensitivity\\", or \\"awareness\\". Thus, mono no aware has frequently been translated as \\"the 'ahh-ness' of things\\", life, and love. Awareness of the transience of all things heightens appreciation of their beauty, and evokes a gentle sadness at their passing. In his criticism of The Tale of Genji Motoori noted that mono no aware is the crucial emotion that moves readers. Its scope was not limited to Japanese literature, and became associated with Japanese cultural tradition (see also sakura).Choy Lee, Khoon. Japan: Between Myth and Reality. 1995, page 142. In contemporary culture Notable manga artists who use mono no aware‚Äìstyle storytelling include Hitoshi Ashinano, Kozue Amano, and Kaoru Mori. In anime, both Only Yesterday by Isao Takahata and Mai Mai Miracle by Sunao Katabuchi emphasize the passing of time in gentle notes and by presenting the main plot against a parallel one from the past. The Japanese director Yasujir≈ç Ozu was well known for creating a sense of mono no aware, frequently climaxing with a character very understatedly saying , after a familial and societal paradigm shift, such as a daughter being married off, against the backdrop of a swiftly changing Japan. Ozu has often expressed feelings by showing the faces of objects rather than the face of an actor. Some examples include two fathers contemplating the rocks in a \\"dry landscape\\" garden, and a mirror reflecting the absence of the daughter who has just left home after getting married. These images exemplified mono no aware as powerfully as the expression on the greatest actor's face. In his book about courtly life in ancient Japan, The World of the Shining Prince, Ivan Morris compares mono no aware to Virgil's term lacrimae rerum, Latin for \\"tears of things\\".Morris, Ivan I. The World of the Shining Prince: Court Life in Ancient Japan. 1994, page 197. Science fiction author Ken Liu's short story, \\"Mono no Aware\\", won the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Short Story. Inspired by works like the science fiction manga Yokohama Kaidashi Kik≈ç, Liu sought to evoke an \\"aesthetic primarily oriented towards creating in the reader an empathy towards the inevitable passing of all things\\", and to acknowledge \\"the importance of memory and continuity with the past\\". Nobel- and Booker Prize- winning British novelist Kazuo Ishiguro ends many of his novels without any sense of resolution. The issues his characters confront are buried in the past and remain unresolved. Thus Ishiguro ends many of his novels on a note of melancholic resignation. His characters accept their past and who they have become, typically discovering that this realization brings comfort and an ending to mental anguish. This can be seen as a literary reflection of the Japanese idea of mono no aware. Films like Alain Resnais's Hiroshima Mon Amour, Shohei Imamura's Black Rain and Akira Kurosawa's I Live in Fear have all been associated with the term. One of the most well-known examples of mono no aware in contemporary Japan is the traditional love of cherry blossoms, found throughout Japanese art and perpetuated by the large masses of people that travel annually to view and picnic under cherry trees. The trees are not considered to be of special value in terms of their beauty in relation to other trees, such as apple or pear trees. Cherry tree blossoms are valued because of their transience, normally associated with the fact that the blossoms fall from the tree after only a week or so after first budding. It is the evanescence of the beauty of the cherry blossom that evokes the weary perspective of mono no aware in the viewer. In 2016, an Ad Council PSA entitled \\"The Extraordinary Life and Times of Strawberry\\" (directed by Martin Stirling) used mono no aware-style storytelling to depict the life of a strawberry. The phrase is the motto of synthwave music duo The Midnight, whose style and mood of music seeks to capture a nostalgic feeling. The genre of synthwave is inspired by 1980s synth-pop mixed with more modern electronic influences. In 2019, the Seattle-based indie rock band, Great Grandpa, released \\"Mono No Aware\\".

His main contribution to medicine has been the first description of leukemia as a blood disorder (1845). The first person to describe leukemia as an unknown disease was Alfred Fran√ßois Donn√©. Bennett was the first doctor to describe aspergillosis. In his seminal paper published in 1842 entitled \\"On the parasitic vegetable structures found growing in living animals\\" he makes the very first description of aspergillus (a pathogenic fungus) growing in the lung tissue of humans. Biography Born in London, he was educated at Mount Radford School in Exeter, and being destined for the medical profession he entered an apprenticeship with Mr Sedgwick, a surgeon in Maidstone. In 1833 he began his studies at Edinburgh, and in 1837 graduated with the highest honours and a gold medal, with a dissertation entitled The Physiology and Pathology of the Brain. During his last year at Edinburgh he was elected President of the Royal Medical Society, Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh, and a vice-president of the Anatomical and Physiological Society. John Hughes Bennett During the next two years he studied in Paris (where he founded the English-speaking Medical Society) and then spent two in Germany (mainly at Heidelberg and the Charit√© Hospital in Berlin), before returning to Edinburgh in 1841 where he published a Treatise on Cod-liver Oil as a Therapeutic Agent. In the same year he began to lecture as an extra-academical teacher on histology, drawing attention to the importance of the microscope in the investigation of disease; and as physician to the Royal Public Dispensary of Edinburgh he instituted courses of polyclinical medicine. In 1843 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Sir Robert Christison. His address was then listed as 1 Glenfinlas Street, just off Charlotte Square.Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, January 1870 In the same year he was appointed professor of the Institutes of Medicine at Edinburgh, and performed the duties of that chair with great energy until incapacitated by failing health, in 1874. In 1845, Bennett published a paper entitled a Case of Hypertrophy of the Spleen and Liver in which Death Took Place from Suppuration of the Blood, the first recorded case of leukemia, then known as leucocythemia, in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal. In 1855 he was a prime opponent of Thomas Laycock for the Edinburgh Chair. His obituary refers to this as an \\"exciting contest\\". Michalel Barfoot wrote in 1995 that in fact extremely bitter,see and became a source of great dissension in subsequent years. Barfoot describes him as having \\"the personality biographers' dreams are made of\\", and quotes Bennett's biographer John M'Kendrick as stating that Bennett \\"regarded his defeat (by Laycock) as the great disappointment of his life, and there is little doubt that it tended to a certain extent to distort his views of men an things\\". In 1859 he was elected President of the Harveian Society. In 1873, he was elected a member of the French Academy of Medicine and granted recognition by the French government to practice medicine in France. In August 1875 he was able to be present at the meeting of the British Medical Association in Edinburgh, on which occasion he received the degree of LL.D., but the fatigue he then underwent brought on a relapse, and he was compelled to have the operation of lithotomy performed. He sank rapidly and died on 25 September 1875 at Norwich. William Brodie, 1875, Old College, University of Edinburgh Bennett died at Norwich on 25 September 1875, nine days after an operation for stone, performed by Mr. Cadge, from which his enfeebled strength did not enable him to recover. He was buried in the Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh, on 30 September by the side of his friends Goodsir and Edward Forbes. Works His publications were very numerousJohn McKendrick gives a list of 106 papers and memoirs by Bennett in the British Medical Journal, 9 October 1875 including Lectures on Clinical Medicine (1850‚Äì1856), which in second and subsequent editions were called Clinical Lectures on the Principles and Practice of Medicine, and were translated into various languages, including Russian and Hindi; Leucocythaemia (1852), the first recorded cure of which was published by him in 1845; Outlines of Physiology (1858), reprinted from the 8th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Pathology and Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (1853); Textbook of Physiology (1871‚Äì1872). Because Bennett introduced practical classes in the teaching of physiology, he is considered the father of physiological education in medical schools. He was also the first to teach the clinical use of the microscope systematically and its uses in the teaching of pathology and physiology. He opposed bloodletting and was highly influential in changing medical therapeutics towards a more science- based approach in the second half of the 19th century. He supported the admission of women to medical schools and advocated a better interaction between medical specialities. Memorials The grave of John Hughes Bennett (right), Dean Cemetery In 1901, the University of Edinburgh inaugurated the John Hughes Bennett Laboratory of Experimental Pathology, in homage to \\"one of that galaxy of talent and genius that illuminated Edinburgh in the middle decades of the last century\\". A second laboratory with his name was opened in 1998, in a joint venture between Britain's Leukaemia Research Fund, the University of Edinburgh and the Western General Hospital Trust. Family On 22 August 1844 Bennett married Jessie Samuel (1824‚Äì1906), a niece of the Reverend Alexander Simpson (later moderator of the Church of Scotland).

He was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft Professional career =Minor League Baseball= In , Trachsel began his professional career with the Short-Season Geneva Cubs and the Class-A Advanced Winston-Salem Spirits. He went a combined 5-4 with a 3.27 ERA in 14 games, all for starts. Trachsel was promoted to the Double-A Charlotte Knights of the Southern League in .

Trachsel was promoted to the Major Leagues in September and made his debut on September 19 against the Florida Marlins going seven innings with five strikeouts while giving up two earned runs and taking the loss. Trachsel would play most of the season with Chicago, pitching just two games in Iowa going 0-2 with a 10.00 ERA. His Minor League stats were much better however as he went 9-7 with a 3.21 ERA in 22 games, all starts. He also had one complete game and struck out 108 total over the season. In Trachsel spent his first full season at the Major League level. He went 7-13 with a 5.15 ERA, 117 strikeouts and two complete games in 30 games, 29 starts.

He also finished the season with a record of 13-9 with two shutouts, three complete games and 132 strikeouts in 32 games, all starts. His first shutout was a one-hit game against the Houston Astros on May 14 where he surrendered the only hit on a lead-off double to Brian Hunter. He also pitched two games with the Double-A Orlando Cubs where he went 0-1 with a 2.77 ERA. In Trachsel started a career-high 34 games with the Cubs, a record he has tied twice.

Upon returning to the Mets, his career was reborn. He finished 2001 well and continued to shine in when he had a 3.37 ERA. His success continued with 16 wins (including his 100th career win) in . Trachsel was even named the National League Player of the Week on August 25, 2003, following a 16.1 inning span in which he allowed no walks, no runs and only six hits.

Other distinguished positions include visiting professor of philosophy at Yale University; the University of California, Santa Barbara; the University of Hawai‚Äôi; and the University of Florida.My real CV - J. Baird Callicott Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac is one of environmental philosophy's seminal texts, and Callicott is widely considered to be the leading contemporary exponent of Leopold's land ethic.Ouderkirk and Hill (2002) Callicott's book In Defense of the Land Ethic (1989) explores the intellectual foundations of Leopold's outlook and seeks to provide it with a more complete philosophical treatment; and a following publication titled Beyond the Land Ethic (1999) further extends Leopold's environmental philosophy. Callicott's Earth‚Äôs Insights (1994) is also considered an important contribution to the budding field of comparative environmental philosophy; a special edition of the journal Worldviews: Environment, Culture, Religion (Vol. 1, Number 2) was devoted to scholarly reviews of the work.Publisher's website: http://www.brill.nl/product_id9007 Callicott is co-Editor-in-Chief with Robert Frodeman of the award-winning, two-volume A-Z Encyclopedia of Environmental Ethics and Philosophy, published by Macmillan in 2009. He is also author of numerous journal articles and book chapters in environmental philosophy and has served as editor or co-editor of many books, textbooks, and reference works in the same field. Biography Callicott was born in Memphis, Tennessee on May 9, 1941, to distinguished regional artist and art instructor Burton H. Callicott (1907‚Äì2003), of the Memphis Academy of Arts (now Memphis College of Art).Unless otherwise indicated, biographical information taken from Callicott‚Äôs personal webpage, available at: http://jbcallicott.weebly.com/index.html In 1959, Callicott graduated from Memphis's then racially segregated Messick High School and attended Southwestern at Memphis (now Rhodes College), earning a B. A. in philosophy with Honors in 1963. He received a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship for graduate study at Syracuse University, completing his M. A. in philosophy (1966) and his doctorate in the same field (1972) after earning a Woodrow Wilson Dissertation Fellowship. His dissertation, titled Plato‚Äôs Aesthetics: An Introduction to the Theory of Forms, drew from the concentration of his undergraduate and graduate work: ancient Greek philosophy. Callicott began his career as an academic philosopher in 1966 at Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis). There, as faculty advisor to the Black Students Association, he was active in the Southern Civil Rights Movement during the time of Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs last campaigns in the area. In 1969, Callicott joined the philosophy department of Wisconsin State University- Stevens Point (now the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point). As ‚Äúan expatriate Southerner, fresh from the pitched battles of the Civil Rights struggle in Memphis, Tennessee,‚Äù Callicott believed that ‚Äúthe environment was under wholesale assault from every direction with no surcease in sight‚Äù and that ‚ÄúCivil Rights was a cause already won in the republic of ideas and in the courts (if not on Main Street in Memphis).‚ÄùCallicott, J. Baird (1987a). ‚ÄúPreface.‚Äù Pages vii-viii in J. Baird Callicott, ed. Companion to A Sand County Almanac: Interpretive and Critical Essays. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. . He ‚Äúwas a concerned citizen, but [he] was also, more particularly, a challenged philosopher.‚Äù(Callicott, 1987a) So Callicott asked ‚Äúhow, as a philosopher, [he] could contribute to a rethinking of human nature and a reconstruction of human values to help bring them into line with the relatively new ideas about the nature of the environment emerging from ecology and the new physics.‚Äù For 26 years, Callicott lived and taught in the northern reaches of Wisconsin's sand counties, located on the Wisconsin River, just ninety miles from Aldo Leopold's storied shack and John Muir's first homestead on Fountain Lake, the region that stirred the souls of two very influential environmental thinkers. Callicott writes that ‚Äúthe landscape that had helped shape and inspire the nascent evolutionary-ecological thought of the youthful Muir and that of the mature Leopold was the perfect setting for (me) to inaugurate (my) life-long vocation as a founder of academic environmental philosophy.‚ÄùJ. Baird Callicott - Home In 1995, he joined the Department of Philosophy and Religion Studies at the University of North Texas in Denton. The first graduate program in environmental philosophy had been launched at UNT in 1990 under the aegis of Eugene C. Hargrove, then department chair and founding editor of the journal Environmental Ethics. The addition of Callicott's expertise helped cement its standing as the world's leading program in the field. Philosophy =Callicott's environmental ethic= > ‚ÄúI set out, as a philosopher, to work as a peer to the moral philosophers of > the past, to create something new under the philosophical sun ‚Äî under the > gaze of Apollo, as it were ‚Äî ‚Äòa new, an environmental ethic,‚Äô such as > Richard Routley had warranted in 1973.‚ÄùIntroductory Palinode - J. Baird > Callicott In accordance with Leopold's oft-quoted dictum ‚Äî \\"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise\\"Leopold, Aldo (1949). A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There. New York: Oxford University Press. . ‚Äî Callicott espouses a holistic, non-anthropocentric environmental ethic. What he labels the ‚Äúextentionist‚Äù approach to environmental ethics attempts to extend familiar anthropocentric ethical paradigms ‚Äî legacies of the European Enlightenment ‚Äî to other-than-human beings. Peter Singer‚Äôs ‚Äúanimal liberation,‚Äù for example, extends Jeremy Bentham‚Äôs utilitarian ethical paradigm to all sentient animals.Singer, Peter (1975). Animal Liberation: A New Ethic for Our Treatment of Animals. New York: New York Review. . Paul W. Taylor's ‚Äúbiocentrism‚Äù extends the Kantian deontological paradigm to all ‚Äúteleological centers of life‚Äù (i.e. all organisms).Taylor, Paul W. (1986) Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. . Extensionist approaches, however, are inveterately individualistic, conferring ‚Äúmoral considerability‚Äù on individual organisms. Actual environmental concerns, however, focus on transorganismic entities: endangered species; threatened biotic communities and ecosystems; rivers and lakes; the ocean and atmosphere. Callicott believes that an adequate environmental ethic ‚Äî an environmental-ethics paradigm that addresses actual environmental concerns ‚Äî must be holistic. Callicott traces the conceptual foundations of the Leopold land ethic first back to Charles Darwin‚Äôs analysis of the ‚Äúmoral sense‚Äù in the Descent of Man and ultimately to David Hume‚Äôs grounding of ethics in the ‚Äúmoral sentiments‚Äù espoused in An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals.Callicott, J. Baird (1987b). ‚ÄúThe Conceptual Foundations of the Land Ethic.‚Äù Pages 186-217 in J. Baird Callicott, ed. Companion to A Sand County Almanac: Interpretive and Critical Essays. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. . Hume argues that moral actions and moral judgments are based on such other-oriented sentiments as sympathy, beneficence, loyalty, and patriotism.Hume, David (1751). An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals. London: A. Millar. . Darwin argues that these ‚Äúmoral sentiments‚Äù evolved as the sine qua non of social (or communal) solidarity, on which depends the survival and reproductive success of the individual members of society (or community).Darwin, Charles (1871). The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1st ed.). London: John Murray. . The tradition of dichotomous thinking in Western philosophy inclines most philosophers to dismiss Hume's ethics as a kind of irrational emotivism, despite the fact that, Callicott believes, Hume clearly provides a key role for reason in moral action and judgment. The faculty of reason, according to Hume, determines (1) relations of ideas, which are essentially logical relationships; and (2) matters of fact.Hume, David (1740). Treatise of Human Nature, Bk III, Pt. I. Sec. I. London: John Noon. . Among such matters of fact, reason both traces the often complex causal chain of the consequences of various actions and discloses the proper objects of the moral sentiments. Accordingly, Leopold also traces both the causal chain of ecological consequences of such seemingly innocent actions as tilling the soil and grazing cattle and discloses a proper object of those moral sentiments ‚Äî such as loyalty and patriotism ‚Äî which are excited by social membership and community identity.Leopold, Sand County; and Flader, S. L. and J. Baird Callicott, eds. (1999). The River of the Mother of God and Other Essays by Aldo. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. . That proper object of such sentiments is the ‚Äúbiotic community,‚Äù revealed by the relatively new science of ecology. =Intrinsic value in Nature= The distinctiveness of environmental ethics turns on the question of non-anthropocentrism, and that question turns on the question of nature's intrinsic value, according to Callicott.Callicott, J. Baird (1985). ‚ÄúIntrinsic Value, Quantum Theory, and Environmental Ethics.‚Äù Environmental Ethics 7: 257-275. For if nature's only value is its instrumental value to humans, then environmental ethics is just a species of applied ethics, similar to bioethics and business ethics, not a completely new domain of ethical theory or moral philosophy. Callicott offers a subjectivist theory of nature's intrinsic value:Callicott, J. Baird (1990). ‚ÄúRolston on Intrinsic Value: A Deconstruction.‚Äù Environmental Ethics 12: 99-124. he does not challenge the modern classical distinction between subject and object, but rather insists that all value originates in subjects (human or otherwise) and is conferred by those subjects on various objects.Callicott, J. Baird (1999). ‚ÄúIntrinsic Value in Nature: A Metaethical Analysis.‚Äù Pages 239-261 in Callicott, J. Baird. Beyond the Land Ethic: More Essays in Environmental Philosophy. Albany: State University of New York Press. . In short, Callicott claims, there would be no value without valuers. These objects, however, are valued by subjects in two fundamentally different ways: instrumentally and intrinsically. Tools of various kinds epitomize the kind of objects that subjects value instrumentally; themselves and certain other human beings epitomize the kind of objects that human subjects value intrinsically. Neither kind of valuing is normally done irrationally. A rational person does not typically value a speck of dust instrumentally; nor does a rational person typically value a plastic cup intrinsically. One values various things as tools for various reasons: drills because by their means one can make neat holes; screwdrivers because by their means one can set screws. When a tool is broken or otherwise becomes useless, a rational person ceases to value it instrumentally; and often broken and useless tools are discarded as trash. One also values various things intrinsically for various good reasons. Philosophers have long provided reasons why human beings should be valued intrinsically (and thus not discarded when broken or useless). Aldo Leopold, according to Callicott, provides reasons why non-human species, biotic communities, and ecosystems should be valued intrinsically (and thus not severely compromised or destroyed). Of wildflowers and songbirds, for example, species with little instrumental value, Leopold writes in Sand County‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Land Ethic‚Äù: ‚ÄúYet these creatures are members of the biotic community, and if (as I believe) its stability depends on its integrity, they are entitled to continuance.‚Äù(Leopold, 1949, p. 210). And later in ‚ÄúThe Land Ethic,‚Äù Leopold directly invokes ‚Äúphilosophical value‚Äù ‚Äî that is, what academic environmental philosophers call ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù: ‚ÄúIt is inconceivable to me that an ethical relationship to land can exist without love, respect, and admiration for land, and a high regard for its value. By value, I of course mean something far broader than mere economic value [instrumental value], I mean value in the philosophical sense [intrinsic value].‚Äù(Leopold, 1949, p. 223). See also: Callicott, J. Baird (1987c). \\"The Philosophical Value of Wildlife,\\" Pages 214-221 in Daniel J. Decker and Gary Goff, eds., Economic and Social Values of Wildlife. Boulder, CO: Westview Press. . =Comparative environmental philosophy= Despite its newness and its departure from familiar ethical paradigms, environmental ethics was, at its inception, using the methods and conceptual resources of the Western philosophical tradition. While that tradition has been enormously influential in shaping Western culture and institutions ‚Äî especially in the domains of law, politics, and jurisprudence ‚Äî the Western religious tradition has also been enormously influential in shaping Western culture and institutions. At first, the Western religious tradition was vilified in environmental ethics as the root cause of the environmental crisis.For the locus classicus, see Lynn White Jr., (1967). ‚ÄúThe Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis.‚Äù Science 155: 1203-1207; For an early example, see Richard Routely, ‚ÄúIs There a Need for a New, an Environmental Ethic‚Äù (1973). Pages 205-210 in Bulgarian Organizing Committee, ed., Proceedings of the Fifteenth World Congress of Philosophy, vol. 1. Sophia: Sophia Press. Callicott has explored the possibility of a Judeo- Christian ‚Äúcitizenship‚Äù environmental ethic as a more radical alternative to the familiar Judeo-Christian ‚Äústewardship‚Äù environmental ethic that was developed in response to criticism from environmental historians and philosophers.Callicott, J. Baird (1991). \\"Genesis and John Muir.\\" Pages 106-138 in Carol Robb and Carl Casebolt, ed., Covenant for a New Creation. Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books. . He has also explored the conceptual resources for environmental ethics in American Indian worldviews and worked with comparative philosophers to explore the conceptual resources for environmental ethics in several Asian philosophical and religious traditions of thought, such as Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism.Callicott, J. Baird (1982). ‚ÄúTraditional American Indian and Western European Attitudes Toward Nature: An Overview.‚Äù Environmental Ethics 4: 293-318. Callicott, J. Baird and Michael P. Nelson (2004).

Baird (1994) Earth‚Äôs Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback. Berkeley: University of California Press. . =Philosophy of conservation and the ‚Äúreceived wilderness idea‚Äù= Callicott has worked with conservation biologists to develop a philosophy of conservation and conservation values and ethics, based in part on the recent paradigm shift in ecology from what he calls the ‚Äúbalance of nature‚Äù to the ‚Äúflux of nature.‚ÄùCallicott, J. Baird (2006). ‚ÄúConservation Values and Ethics.‚Äù Pages 111-135 in Groom, Martha J., Gary K. Meffe, and C. Ronald Carroll, Principles of Conservation Biology, 3rd. ed. Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. . Callicott, J. Baird, Larry B. Crowder, and Karen Mumford (1999). ‚ÄúCurrent Normative Concepts in Conservation.‚Äù Conservation Biology 13: 22-35. He has been a strong critic of the ‚Äúreceived wilderness idea‚Äù: the idea that wildernesses are places that are ‚Äúuntrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.‚ÄùPublic Law 88-577 (16 U.S. C. 1131-1136) 88th Congress, S. 4, September 3, 1964: Sec. 2 (c). That idea, Callicott claims in The Great New Wilderness Debate (1998), perpetuates a pre-Darwinian human-nature dualism; in effect, it ‚Äúerases‚Äù from collective memory the indigenous inhabitants of North America and Australia, liberating the current inhabitants of those continents from disturbing thoughts of their own heritage of genocide. Exported to other regions of the world, such as Africa and India, where indigenous peoples still thrive, the wilderness idea has been used to justify their eviction and dispossession in the name of national parks. Callicott instead proposes that, because wilderness areas serve purposes of biological conservation, they should be reconceived more fittingly as ‚Äúbiodiversity reserves.‚ÄùCallicott, J. Baird and Michael P. Nelson (1999). The Great New Wilderness Debate. Athens: University of Georgia Press. . Criticisms In response to Callicott's elaboration of the Aldo Leopold land ethic, the land ethic (and, by implication, Callicott's own non-anthropocentric, holistic environmental ethic to the extent that it may differ from Leopold's) has been subject to the charge of ‚Äúecofascism,‚Äù notably leveled by Tom Regan.Regan, Tom (1983). The Case for Animal Rights. Berkeley: University of California Press. . If members of overpopulous species, such as deer, ought to be ‚Äúculled‚Äù or ‚Äúharvested,‚Äù in the name of preserving the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community, and if staggeringly overpopulous Homo sapiens is also but ‚Äúa plain member and citizen‚Äù of the biotic community, then why should culling and harvesting humans be any less obligatory? In ‚ÄúThe Conceptual Foundations of the Land Ethic,‚Äù Callicott replies that Leopold presented the land ethic as an ‚Äúaccretion‚Äù to our evolving complex set of ethics.(Callicott, 1987b) In other words, the land ethic burdens us with additional moral obligations; it does not substitute for or replace our previously evolved moral obligations, among them the duty to respect the rights of our fellow human beings to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.Callicott, J. Baird (1999). ‚ÄúHolistic Environmental Ethics and the Problem of Ecofascism.‚Äù Pages 59-76 in J. Baird Callicott. Beyond the Land Ethic: More Essays in Environmental Philosophy. Albany, N.Y. : State University of New York Press. . This reply led to another criticism: that Callicott provides no ‚Äúsecond-order principles‚Äù to prioritize duties to fellow humans and those to the biotic community when they conflict.Shrader-Frechette, K. S. (1996). ‚ÄúIndividualism, Holism, and Environmental Ethics.‚Äù Ethics and the Environment 1: 55-69. In response, Callicott offered two second-order principles as a framework to adjudicate between conflicting first-order duties: 1) ‚Äúobligations generated by membership in more venerable and intimate communities take precedence over those generated in more recently emerged and impersonal communities‚Äù; 2) ‚Äústronger interests take precedence over duties generated by weaker interests.‚Äù(Callicott, 1999, p. 73) Because our various human community memberships are both more venerable and intimate and because human interests in enjoying rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are very strong, Callicott argues that our traditional obligations to individual fellow human beings trump our obligations to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community ‚Äî at least, he believes, when it comes to the prospect of culling members of the overpopulous Homo sapiens species. Additionally, Callicott has been criticized for espousing an overbearing and impolitic monism in environmental ethics.Weston, Anthony (1992). ‚ÄúBefore Environmental Ethics.‚Äù Environmental Ethics 14: 321-338. He does not reject pluralism in environmental ethics outright; he only rejects theoretical pluralism, not interpersonal pluralism or normative pluralism. Callicott claims that philosophers and laypersons should not adopt one theory, say utilitarianism, for one purpose or in one context and another theory, say Kantian deontology, for another purpose or in another context (this would be theoretical pluralism).Callicott, J. Baird (1990). ‚ÄúThe Case Against Moral Pluralism.‚Äù Environmental Ethics 12: 99-124. Such theories are mutually contradictory, and he believes that one's moral life should be coherent and self-consistent; however, he also believes that each person should be free to adopt the theory that to them is the most intellectually compelling (interpersonal pluralism).Callicott, J. Baird (1994). ‚ÄúMoral Monism in Environmental Philosophy Defended.‚Äù Journal of Philosophical Research 19: 51-60. The general theory that Callicott espouses, Humean communitarianism, correlates ethics to community membership. And because each moral agent is subject to as many ethics as his or her community memberships, therefore each person is subject to a plurality of duties and obligations (normative pluralism). In sum, Callicott is a theoretical monist and an interpersonal and normative pluralist. Callicott's comparative environmental philosophy also involves a tightrope walk between pluralism and monism. In Earth‚Äôs Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback, he seems to embrace pluralism by exploring the conceptual resources for environmental ethics in a wide variety of religious and indigenous worldviews.(Callicott, 1994) This work has been criticized, however, for privileging the Leopold land ethic as a norm in reference to which such alternative environmental ethics are evaluated.Eaton, Heather (1997). Earth‚Äôs Insights . . . and Inadequacies.‚Äù Worldviews 1: 113-121; Lorentzen, Lois Ann (1997). ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Postmodern about Earth‚Äôs Insights.‚Äù Woldviews 1: 123-129. As Andrew Light observes, Callicott does not insist that the Leopold land ethic is based on the uniquely true worldview of evolutionary biology and ecology.Light, Andrew (1995). ‚ÄúAround the World with Aldo Leopold (Review of J. Baird Callicott‚Äôs Earth‚Äôs Insights).‚Äù Trumpeter 12 (1): 53-55. For additional critiques of this work and Callicott‚Äôs response, see Taylor, B., ed. (1997). \\"Special theme issue on J. Baird Callicott's Earth's Insights.‚Äù Worldviews: Environment, Culture, Religion 1: 93-182. He agrees with multicultural pluralists that the evolutionary-ecological worldview is but one story among many stories. But he does argue that the worldview of evolutionary biology and ecology is more tenable than any other, that the evolutionary-ecological epic is a better story than any other grand narrative.Callicott, J. Baird (1997). ‚ÄúIn Defense of Earth‚Äôs Insights.‚Äù Worldviews 1: 167-182. Callicott's justification for this claim is an analysis based on the following criteria for tenability: self-consistency; comprehensiveness; self-correction; universality; and beauty. The first test of a scientific worldview is logical self-consistency and the evolutionary- ecological worldview passes that test. A tenable scientific worldview must comprehend all known facts and so far the evolutionary-ecological worldview does account for all the facts, such as the existence of the fossil remains of extinct species. When the details of that worldview are shown to be inconsistent with themselves or unable to account for all the facts, the theory is revised accordingly; the evolutionary-ecological worldview is thus self-correcting and is therefore, Callicott believes, becoming ever more refined. The evolutionary-ecological worldview has global currency and enjoys international credibility; that is, it has universal appeal. And finally, as to beauty, Darwin himself observed in the final sentence of the Origin that ‚ÄúThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.‚ÄùDarwin, Charles (1860). On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, Or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. London: John Murray. 2nd edition. p. 490. . Most recent criticisms have been leveled at Callicott's works addressing the idea of wilderness, the sanctum sanctorum of the twentieth-century environmental movement. Some scholars acknowledge the intellectual merits of Callicott's critique of the wilderness idea, but regard it as both a betrayal of one of Aldo Leopold's most cherished causes and as giving aid and comfort to the environmental movement's enemies.See: Callicott, J. Baird and Michael P. Nelson, eds. (1998). The Great New Wilderness Debate. Athens: University of Georgia Press. ; and Nelson, Michael P. and J. Baird Callicott, eds. (2008) The Wilderness Debate Rages On: Continuing the Great New Wilderness Debate. Athens: University of Georgia Press. Callicott counters that his quarrel is with an idea, not the places trammeled by the idea, the preservation of which places he appears to be as ardently supportive as any other environmentalist. In ‚ÄúShould Wilderness Areas Become Biodiversity Reserves,‚Äù he argues that the pressing conservation needs of the twenty-first century are better served by the biodiversity-reserve idea.Callicott, J. Baird (1996). ‚ÄúShould Wilderness Areas Become Biodiversity Reserves.‚Äù The George Wright Forum 13: 32-38. This idea indicates by its very name what the primary goal of wildland preservation is, whereas the wilderness idea is historically associated with outdoor recreation and thus, Callicott claims, confuses the preservation issue and fosters incoherent and contradictory wildlands-use policies.

Business development Workspace refers to small premises provided, often by local authorities or economic development agencies, to help new businesses to establish themselves. These typically provide not only physical space and utilities but also administrative services and links to support and finance organizations, as well as peer support among the tenants. A continuum of sophistication ranges through categories such as 'managed workspaces', 'business incubators' and 'business and employment co- operatives'. In cities, they are often set up in buildings that are disused but which the local authority wishes to retain as a landmark. At the larger end of the spectrum are business parks, virtual offices, technology parks and science parks. Technology and software In technology and software, \\"workspace\\" is a term used for several different purposes. =Software development= A workspace is (often) a file or directory that allows a user to gather various source code files and resources and work with them as a cohesive unit. Often these files and resources represent the complete state of an integrated development environment (IDE) at a given time, a snapshot. Workspaces are very helpful in cases of complex projects when maintenance can be challenging. Good examples of environments that allow users to create and use workspaces are Microsoft Visual Studio and Eclipse. In configuration management, \\"workspace\\" takes on a different but related meaning; it is a part of the file system where the files of interest (for a given task like debugging, development, etc.) are located. It stores the user's view of the files stored in the configuration management's repository. In either case, workspace acts as an environment where a programmer can work, isolated from the outside world, for the task duration. =Graphical interfaces= GNOME's workspace switcher. Additionally, workspaces refer to the grouping of windows in some window managers. Grouping applications in this way is meant to reduce clutter and make the desktop easier to navigate. Multiple workspaces are prevalent on Unix-like operating systems and certain operating system shells. Mac OS X 10.5 and later macOS releases include an equivalent feature called \\"Spaces\\". Windows 10 now offers a similar feature called 'Task View'. Windows XP PowerToy is available to bring this functionality to Windows XP. Most systems with support for workspaces provide keyboard shortcuts to switch between them. Many also include some form of workspace switcher to change between them and sometimes to move windows between them as well. Workspaces are visualized in different ways. For example, on Linux computers using Compiz or Beryl with the Cube and Rotate Cube plugins enabled, each workspace is rendered as a face of an on-screen cube, and switching between workspaces is visualized by zooming out from the current face, rotating the cube to the new face, and zooming back in. On macOS, the old set of windows slides off the screen and the new set slides on. Window managers without \\"eye candy\\" often simply remove the old windows and display the new ones without any sort of intermediate effect. =Computer-supported cooperative work= In the context of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) a shared workspace is a place of collaboration that enables group awareness. \\"A shared workspace provides a sense of place where collaboration takes place. It is generally associated with some part of the screen real estate of the user‚Äôs computer where the user ‚Äò‚Äògoes‚Äô‚Äô to work on shared artifacts, discovers work status, and interacts with his/her collaborators.\\" =Online applications= In the context of software as a service, \\"workspace\\" is a term used by software vendors for applications that allow users to exchange and organize files over the Internet. Such applications have several advantages over traditional FTP clients or virtual folder offerings, including: * Ability to capture task performance data and version data * Organization of information in a more user-friendly interface than a traditional file-based structure * Secure storage and upload/download of data (many FTP clients are unsecured, susceptible to eavesdropping, or open to other abuse) * Compatible with virtually all web browsers and computer operating systems. * Updated on the server-side, meaning that a user will never have to update the software. Beyond organizing and sharing files, these applications can often also be used as a business communication tool for assigning tasks, scheduling meetings, and maintaining contact information. =Robotics= In Robotics, the workspace of a robot manipulator is often defined as the set of points that can be reached by its end-effector or, in other words, it is the space in which the robot works and it can be either a 3D space or a 2D surface. Mobile or unified workspace A mobile or unified workspace allows enterprise IT to have a trusted space on any device where IT can deliver business applications and data. Ever since the iPad was released by Apple in 2009, bring your own device (BYOD) has become an increasingly more important problem for IT. Until now, IT has purchased, provisioned, and managed all enterprise desktops which run the Microsoft Windows software.http://www.workspot.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/02/Workspot-Technology-White-Paper-.pdf There are nearly 500 million enterprise desktops in the world. However, with the introduction of smartphones and tablets, there are far more devices that are owned by the end-user - 750 million PCs and Macs, 1.5 billion smartphones, and 500 million tablets. These also run different operating systems, like iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS. How does deliver business applications and data to end- users on these heterogeneous operating systems and form factors? Federica Tronihttp://www.gartner.com/AnalystBiography?authorId=10906 and Mark Margeviciushttp://www.gartner.com/AnalystBiography?authorId=13910 introduced the concept of Workspace Aggregator to solve the problem of BYOD. According to Gartner, a workspace aggregator unifies five capabilities: (1) Application Delivery: The ability to orchestrate provisioning and de-provisioning of mobile, PC and Web applications (2) Data: The secure delivery of corporate data (3) Management: Management of application life cycle, metering, and monitoring features (4) Security: Provision of context-aware security (5) User Experience: A superior user experience through the delivery of a unified workspace References Business terms Collaborative projects Computer programming Corporate jargon Enterprise resource planning terminology Graphical control elements Graphical user interface elements Logistics ","title":"Workspace"},{"id":"1375109","text":"The Raid Gauloises or The Raid is considered by many to be the first modern adventure race and was first held in 1989. Its creator, G√©rard Fusil, took the existing concept of long distance endurance races, and focused on the team aspects, requiring each competitor to be part of a five-person co-ed team. The Raid had no set course, with competitors being required to rely on their wits and judgment to reach the specified checkpoints. The Raid was named after its original sponsor, the Gauloises Cigarette Company. In 1996, Fusil left the Raid to begin a new adventure race series, the Elf Authentic Adventure. Patrick Brignoli and Alain Gaimard continued to organize the Raid with their company RGO and Saga d'Aventures (The 1997 Raid in Ecuador was the first raid organized without Fusil). 2003 was the last year for the Raid Gauloises. In 2004 the Raid Gauloises was retooled into the Raid World Championship.

Early life  Hamburger Werftarbeiter - 1928 He was born in Bremen, and studied at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf from 1890‚Äì95. His artistic studies during this period included visits to Belgium and Italy. Vogeler was a central member of the original artist colony in Worpswede, which he joined in 1894. In 1895 Vogeler bought a cottage there and planted many birch trees around it, which gave the house its new name: Barkenhoff (Low German for Birkenhof, or \\"birch tree cottage\\"). In 1901, he married Martha Schr√∂der. He made book illustrations in an art nouveau style, and executed decorative paintings for the town hall of Bremen shortly before traveling to Ceylon in 1906. During a trip to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, he studied Maxim Gorky's works, which resulted in the development of a deep sympathy for the working class. This feeling reached further heights when he saw life in the slums of Glasgow and Manchester during a trip. In 1908 he and his brother Franz founded the 'Worpsweder Werkst√§tte', which produced household objects. His paintings increasingly reflected his sympathy for the working class. During the First World War He volunteered for military service in World War I in 1914, and he was sent to the eastern front in 1915. Vogeler came to know of the Bolsheviks ideology during his time at the front as well as through his trips to Poland, Romania, Dobrudscha and Russia. After he made a written appeal for peace to the German Emperor, he was briefly sent to a mental hospital in Bremen before being discharged from military service. The Third Reich, 1934 Political activism After the war he became a pacifist. During the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, he joined the workers' and soldiers' council of the Bremen Soviet Republic, together with his friend Curt Stoermer. He joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), but when it split, he joined the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD). He was close to Franz Pfemfert, who published Die Aktion. After the end of the Revolution, he was arrested for some time. It was at that time that he and his wife Martha were divorced. From that point on, he wanted to work ideologically, and the romanticism of his earlier work gave way to proletarian content. In 1931 Vogeler and his second wife Zofia \\"Sonja\\" Marchlewska, daughter of Julian Marchlewski, emigrated to Russia. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union he along with other German citizens was deported in 1941 to Kazakhstan by the Soviet authorities, and died there in 1942. Heinrich Vogeler, Sommerabend KPD leader Wilhelm Pieck apparently had wanted to prevent his deportation, but Vogeler himself refused privileged treatment. As his wife Zofia and son Jan were Polish citizens they were drafted instead of being deported with him. Jan soon became a founding member of the National Committee for a Free Germany and after a long post-war academic career in Moscow died in his father's Worpswede in 2005. Zofia emigrated to Poland and died in Warsaw in 1983. Meanwhile, the Barkenhoff became a children's home. It was recently restored and has re-opened as a Heinrich Vogeler Museum in 2004. Late works from Heinrich Vogeler's ourvre appear to have some Egyptian influences, particularly in images such as Der Aufbau der zentralasiatischen Sowjetrepubliken (1927). The influence remains in Worpswede amongst particular sculptures, and market performances.

Like other downtowns it is the commercial and economic centre of the city. It is sometimes referred to as the Central Business District and contains Ottawa's financial district. It is bordered by the Ottawa River to the north, the Rideau Canal to the east, Gloucester Street to the south and Bronson Avenue to the west. This area and the residential neighbourhood to the south are also known locally as 'Centretown'. The total population of the area is 4,876 (2016 Census).(Census tract number 5050048.00) http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census- recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd- pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&T;=1601&SR;=51&S;=94&O;=A&RPP;=25&PR;=0&CMA;=505&CSD;=0 Characteristics Downtown Ottawa is dominated by government buildings such as Parliament Hill (left) and The Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council (right). Downtown Ottawa is dominated by government buildings, including Parliament Hill and the Supreme Court. Most prominent buildings are situated along Wellington, Sparks and Elgin streets.

Today, several buildings are taller than the Peace Tower, with the tallest being the 29-storey Place de Ville (Tower C) at , which was built above the height limit, and several hotels being slightly shorter but with 30-35 stories.

It should not be confused with its principal opponent, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by Robert E. Lee. History Gen. Pope's headquarters during the battle of Cedar Mountain The Army of Virginia was constituted on June 26, 1862, by General Orders Number 103, from four existing departments operating around Virginia: Maj. Gen. John C. Fr√©mont's Mountain Department, Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell's Department of the Rappahannock, Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks's Department of the Shenandoah, and Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis's brigade from the Military District of Washington. Maj. Gen. John Pope commanded the new organization, which was divided into three corps of over 50,000 men. Three corps of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac later were added for combat operations. Radical Republicans in Congress and the Cabinet saw the Army of Virginia as taking the lead in widening the goals of the war. The senior officers of the Army were stronger advocates of the abolition of slavery and the southern way of life and had a smaller proportion of West Point graduates than the contemporary Army of the Potomac. Banks's corps of the Army of Virginia fought against Stonewall Jackson at the Battle of Cedar Mountain, gaining initial advantage, but was defeated by a Confederate counterattack led by A.P. Hill.

She is one of very few acclaimed female outsider artists. Life Alo√Øse Corbaz was born in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1886. She earned her baccalaur√©at in 1906. Although she dreamt of becoming a singer, Alo√Øse worked as a dressmaker until leaving for Germany in 1911. She eventually found work as a teacher and a governess, in Potsdam, at the court of German Kaiser Wilhelm II. While there, she developed an obsessive romantic passion for the Kaiser. The start of World War I necessitated Alo√Øse's return to Switzerland. Her imaginary romance with the Kaiser continued, leading to her being diagnosed with schizophrenia and committed to the asylum at Cery-sur-Lausanne in 1918. In 1920 she was moved to an annex of the hospital, la Rosiere a Gimet, where she remained until her death in 1964. Work She started drawing and writing poetry in secret circa 1920, but most of her early work has been destroyed; director of the hospital Hans Steck and general practitioner Jacqueline Porret-Forel first took an interest in 1936, and her work was finally discovered by Dubuffet in 1947. He believed Alo√Øse cured herself by ceasing to fight against her illness, by choosing to cultivate it and make use of it instead.Outsider Art Sourcebook, ed.

Life and work Born in Cambridge, Mayne studied Chemistry at Balliol College, Oxford University. Here he became interested in photographic processing, and met Hugo van Wadenoyen, a key figure in British photography's break with pictorialism. On graduating in 1951 Mayne contributed pictures to Picture Post, and was an occasional film stills photographer. In the early 1950s he made photographic portraits of many residents in the artist's-colony town of St. Ives, Cornwall. He operated very much in an aesthetic vacuum, struggling to find any coherent tradition of British photography to follow. In 1956 he had a one-man show of his portraits at the ICA (UK), and George Eastman House (US). By 1957 he was established as a freelance photographer for London magazines and book-jacket designers. With some financial and limited curatorial security established, he began to look for a significant personal project. He found it in the street life of Southam Street in Notting Dale (now often considered part of Notting Hill), which he photographed between 1956 and 1961. The novelist Colin MacInnes asked Mayne to contribute the cover shot for Absolute Beginners (1959), which is set in the area around Southam Street. The Southam Street collection is of national importance, and is now held by the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Most of Southam Street was demolished in 1969 to make way for Trellick Tower; a small section still exists. Mayne's Southam Street work had a major retrospective exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1986; and was brought to a new audience in the 1990s, through being extensively used for concert backdrops, record sleeves and press-adverts by the singer Morrissey.\\"Roger Mayne\\", Morrissey-solo.com. Accessed 23 February 2010. In the early 1960s Mayne moved into colour photography, photographing Greece and Spain, artists and their studios, and then landscapes, and publishing work in the mid and late 1960s in the new Sunday Times and Observer colour magazines. In 1962, Mayne married the playwright Ann Jellicoe. They moved to Lyme Regis in Dorset in 1975. A major exhibition of his portraits was held at the National Portrait Gallery in 2004, and there have been other major exhibitions at Victoria Art Gallery, Bath (2013) and at The Photographers' Gallery, London (2017).

It stars Van Heflin, Anne Bancroft, Richard Boone and Lee Marvin. It is loosely based on a true incident, the St. Albans Raid, as well as the book by Herbert Ravenal Sass. However the film made a significant change, turning the raid into an act of revenge for William Tecumseh Sherman's burning of Atlanta. Plot In 1864 a group of Confederate prisoners held in a Union prison stockade at Plattsburgh, New York, not many miles from the Canada‚ÄìUS border, escape. They head for Montreal, Canada and then plan a raid across the border into St. Albans, Vermont, to rob its banks to replenish the Confederate treasury and burn buildings as revenge for Sherman's March to the Sea and to tie up Union forces. The leader of the raid, Major Neal Benton (Van Heflin), heads into St. Albans as a spy, and develops ambiguous feelings about what he is doing when he becomes friends with a young war widow and her friendly son, who he boards with, masquerading as a Canadian businessman. Other raiders stay in an abandoned barn, or pose as traveling street peddlers. One drunken member interrupts a church service, and is promptly shot dead by Benton, the raid leader, almost giving away the plot. The townspeople shower Benton with gratitude for this, not realizing his true identity. On the appointed day, Major Benton in town, and the other raiders at the barn, all don Confederate uniforms, take some citizens hostage, rob the bank's strongbox at gunpoint, burn down the town hall, and gallop north just ahead of an arriving Union force. Burning a bridge behind them, they barely elude the Union forces, and make a successful getaway to nearby Canada. Cast * Van Heflin as Maj.

The WBEM initiative, initially sponsored in 1996 by BMC Software, Cisco Systems, Compaq Computer, Intel, and Microsoft, is now widely adopted. WBEM is based on Internet standards and Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) open standards: * Common Information Model (CIM) infrastructure and schema ** CIM-XML ** CIM operations over HTTP * WS- Management for web services *CIM Operations over RESTful Services Although the name labels WBEM as \\"web-based\\", it is not necessarily dependent on any particular user interface (see below). Other systems-management approaches include remote shells, proprietary solutions and IETF standardized network- management architectures like the SNMP and netconf. Features WBEM allows the management of any element in a standard and inter-operable manner. WBEM provides the technology underlying different management initiatives in information technology: * desktop management (DASH) * network management (NetMan) **There is a DMTF page that shows a number of DSP pdfs that are the published profiles of the NetMan Initiative * storage management (SMI) * systems management (SMASH) * virtualization management (VMAN) **There is a DMTF page that shows a number of DSP pdfs that are the published profiles of the VMAN Initiative Architecture To understand the WBEM architecture, consider the components which lie between the operator trying to manage a device (configure it, turn it off and on, collect alarms, etc.) and the actual hardware and software of the device: # the operator will invoke some form of graphical user interface (GUI), Browser User Interface (BUI), or command-line interface (CLI). The WBEM standard has nothing to say about this interface (although the definition of a CLI for specific applications has started): WBEM operates independently of the human interface, since human interfaces can change without the rest of the system needing to note such changes. # the GUI, BUI or CLI will interface with a WBEM client through a small set of application programming interfaces (APIs). This client will find the WBEM server for the managed device (typically on the device itself) and construct an XML message containing the request. # the client will use the HTTP (or HTTPS) protocol to pass the request, encoding it in CIM-XML, to the WBEM server # the WBEM server will decode the incoming request, perform the necessary authentication and authorization checks and then consult the previously defined model of the managed device to see how to handle the request. This model provides the power of the architecture: it represents the pivot point of the transaction, with the client simply interacting with the model and the model interacting with the real hardware or software. The model uses the Common Information Model standard; the DMTF has published many models for commonly managed devices and services: IP routers, storage servers, desktop computers, etc. # for most operations, the WBEM server determines from the model that it needs to communicate with the actual hardware or software. So-called \\"providers\\" handle the interaction: small pieces of code interface between the WBEM server (using a standardised interface known as CMPI) The Common Manageability Programming Interface and the real hardware or software. Because the interface is well-defined and the number of types of call is small, it is normally easy to write providers. In particular, the writer of the provider knows nothing of the GUI, BUI, or CLI used by the operator. WBEM specifications *Mappings **URI (WBEM URI Mapping Specification 1.0) **XML (xmlCIM as used in CIM-XML) **XML (WS-CIM as used in WS-Management) **UML *Protocols **CIM-XML **WS-Management **CIM-RS *Discovery **SLP (WBEM Discovery using SLP; SLP Template) *Query Language **CQL (CIM Query Language 1.0) **FQL (Filter Query Language 1.0) Implementing support So, which pieces of this does a device manufacturer or service provider have to write? * Firstly the model. :This is normally done by extending as necessary one of the standard models published by the DMTF. * Then the BUI, GUI, or CLI. :The client and server usually do not need to be written because there are many open-source and commercial implementations available (see External links below) * Then the providers :In summary, the WBEM architecture allows the manufacturer of a device or developer of a service to provide a standards- compliant management interface to that device simply and cheaply.

The southernmost examples occur around Hull (although Cooke drew examples at Yarmouth, see his Shipping and Craft series of drawings of 1829); the type extends to Burnmouth just across the Scottish border. The distinctive shape of the boat ‚Äî flat-bottomed and high-bowed ‚Äî arose to cope with the particular conditions prevalent in this area. Flat bottoms allowed launching from and landing upon shallow, sandy beaches; an advantage in this part of the coast where the wide bays and inlets provided little shelter from stormy weather. However, fishermen required high bows to sail in the dangerous North Sea and in particular to launch into the surf and to land on the beaches. The design contains relics of Norse influence, though in the main it shows Dutch origin. A Scottish version of the coble, much shallower and beamier than the English type, serves for salmon-fishing off beaches near Arbroath and Montrose in Angus. These cobles have a less refined construction than their southern counterparts. Ghillies employ a smaller, better-built version for fly fishing on Scottish rivers. Local boat-builders constructed the clinker-built cobles locally as required, without the use of plans. The craftsmanship on many boats gave them a long working life. They had a reputation as dangerous to sail for an inexperienced crew, but in the hands of experts could move both safely and speedily. , surviving cobles generally use diesel engines, removing the need for the distinctively shaped lug sail. In a further concession to comfort, a tarpaulin shelter often covers the bow. The Northumberland coastal village of Newbiggin-by-the-Sea has a pub called \\"The Coble\\" named in tribute to these boats. A park, Coble Dene, in nearby North Shields is likewise named after the vessel.

It can also be described as green engineering, but the design professionals best known for landscape engineering are landscape architects. Landscape engineering is the interdisciplinary application of engineering and other applied sciences to the design and creation of anthropogenic landscapes. It differs from, but embraces traditional reclamation. It includes scientific disciplines: Agronomy, Botany, Ecology, Forestry, Geology, Geochemistry, Hydrogeology, and Wildlife Biology. It also draws upon applied sciences: Agricultural & Horticultural Sciences, Engineering Geomorphology, landscape architecture, and Mining, Geotechnical, and Civil, Agricultural & Irrigation Engineering. Landscape engineering builds on the engineering strengths of declaring goals, determining initial conditions, iteratively designing, predicting performance based on knowledge of the design, monitoring performance, and adjusting designs to meet the declared goals. It builds on the strengths and history of reclamation practice. Its distinguishing feature is the marriage of landforms, substrates, and vegetation throughout all phases of design and construction, which previously have been kept as separate disciplines. Though landscape engineering embodies all elements of traditional engineering (planning, investigation, design, construction, operation, assessment, research, management, and training), it is focused on three main areas. The first is closure planning ‚Äì which includes goal setting and design of the landscape as a whole. The second division is landscape design more focused on the design of individual landforms to reliably meet the goals as set out in the closure planning process. Landscape performance assessment is critical to both of these, and is also important for estimating liability and levels of financial assurance. The iterative process of planning, design, and performance assessment by a multidisciplinary team is the basis of landscape engineering. Source: McKenna, G.T., 2002. Sustainable mine reclamation and landscape engineering. PhD Thesis, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada 661p. Example A good example for contemporary landscape engineering and natural resources management related to the Biosphere 2 and Seawater farming projects, is the IBTS Greenhouse, formerly the Forest City designed for the Emirate of Ras al Khaimah. The IBTS rests on a thoroughly integrated design with more than 340 different engineering, science and technology disciplines. It was created for desert greening of hot, arid deserts and optimized for fresh water production from saline, or brackish water. The Integrated Biotectural System is based on a wetland, more specifically a mangrove eco-system designed for food and fodder production of 80tons per hectare and year, also called mariculture. The atmosphere inside the IBTS is turned into a potent water source and harvested with a combination of condensation utilities which makes it a more energy efficient desalination facility than industrial plants. It can produce 500.000m3 of distilled water per day while reclaiming 1000ha of hot arid desert lands. The electricity for the desalination is produced by an on-site forest of micro wind turbines located on the same footprint. These numbers are important because the performance data of for-profit engineered landscapes like wetlands for wastewater treatment or agro-ecological farming sites distinguishes technically feasible from financially and ecologically beneficial projects. The IBTS is an example for sustainable landscape design that reclaims and recreates productive ecosystems including seawater farming, aquaculture, farming, forestry and residence for a human population. It has become feasible because of the design of a Bedouin Greenhouse-shape, automatic construction and maintenance of the vast membrane Sky-roof. The up-front and operational cost could thus be reduced so far that entire landscapes can be covered permanently, not in a common Greenhouse fashion, but with an architectural structure that allows for a real-size forest and urban development below the Sky-roof. The inherent concepts of the IBTS can be used to engineer, terra-form and activate deserts and other landscapes with harsh conditions. In 2015 the governor of Alaska received an offer for a fully self- sufficient multi-residence housing project based on the concepts developed for the IBTS project and adopted for arctic climate by the developer TS Prototype- Creation. Irrigation Engineering Degree founder The father of the first Irrigation Engineering Degree in the Americas was Louis George Carpenter (March 28, 1861 ‚Äì September 12, 1935) He was a college Professor and later the Dean of Engineering & Physics at Colorado State University formerly known as the Colorado Agricultural College.Guide to the Papers of Louis G. Carpenter, Colorado State University He was also an Engineer, Mathematician and an Irrigation and Consulting Engineer. It was there where Carpenter began the first organized and systematic college program for irrigation engineering starting in 1888. Those completing such instruction were awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Irrigation Engineering. Carpenter was one of the foremost leading experts on irrigation systems. During his life he investigated irrigation systems not only in North America but also in Canada and Europe. This led to his engineering consulting and water law. He became Colorado's State Engineer which he held for several years while still teaching. Carpenter was involved in not only in irrigation engineering but consulting on hydraulic construction projects and the problems associated with such projects.

Wright Mills in his 1959 book The Sociological Imagination to describe the type of insight offered by the discipline of sociology. The term is used in introductory textbooks in sociology to explain the nature of sociology and its relevance in daily life. Definitions Sociologists differ in their understanding of the concept, but the range suggests several important commonalities. Together, they conclude that C. Wright Mills defined sociological imagination as \\"the awareness of the relationship between personal experience and the wider society\\".Mills, C. Wright. The Sociological Imagination (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959), 5, 7. Print Sociological imagination is an outlook on life that tries to break away from the monotony of day to day life. Specifically, the sociological imagination involves an individual developing a deep understanding of how their biography is a result of historical process and occurs within a larger social context. : Sociological imagination: The application of imaginative thought to the asking and answering of sociological questions. Someone using the sociological imagination \\"thinks himself away\\" from the familiar routines of daily life.Giddens, Anthony (2006). Sociology (fifth edition). Cambridge: Polity Another way of describing sociological imagination is the understanding that social outcomes are based on what we do. To expand on that definition, it is understanding that some things in society may lead to a certain outcome.The factors mentioned are examples like norms and motives, the social context, and the social action which all affects others. The things we do are shaped by: the situation we are in, the values we have, and the way people around us act. These devices are examined to find how they all relate to one outcome. Sociological imagination can also be considered as a quality of mind that understands the interplay of the individual and society. Things that shape these outcomes include (but are not limited to): social norms, what people want to gain from their actions (their motives), and the social context in which they live (e.g. country, time period, people with whom they associate). Sociological imagination is the capacity to shift from one perspective to another. To have a sociological imagination, a person must be able to pull away from the situation and think from an alternative point of view. It requires us to \\"think ourselves away from our daily routines and look at them anew\\". To acquire knowledge, it is important to break free from the immediacy of personal circumstances and put things into a wider context, rather than following a routine. Mills believed in the power of the sociological imagination to connect \\"personal troubles to public issues\\". There is an urge to know the historical and sociological meaning of the singular individual in society, particularly within their time period. To do this one may use the sociological imagination to better understand the larger historical scene in terms of its meaning for the inner self and external career of a variety of individuals. The sociological imagination can be seen practiced if one reflects on their history for all past events have led up to the present, mostly following the same pattern. Mills argued that history is an important element in sociological imagination. These different historical events have shaped modern society as a whole and each individual within it. It allows a person to see where their life is at compared to others, based on past experiences. Mills argues that one can only truly understand themselves if they can truly understand their circumstances. Another perspective is that Mills chose sociology because he felt it was a discipline that \\"...could offer the concepts and skills to expose and respond to social injustice\\".Rose K. Goldsen, \\"Mills and the Profession of Sociology,\\" in The New Sociology, ed. Irving Lewis Horowitz (New York: Oxford University Press, 1964), 5. Print. He eventually became disappointed with his profession of sociology because he felt it was abandoning its responsibilities, which he criticized in his book The Sociological Imagination. In some introductory sociology classes the sociological imagination is brought up, along with Mills and how he characterized the sociological imagination as a critical quality of mind that would help men and women \\"to use information and to develop reason in order to achieve lucid summations of what is going on in the world and of what may be happening within themselves\\".Keen, Mike Forrest. Stalking the Sociological Imagination: J. Edgar Hoover's FBI Surveillance of American Sociology. Westport, Conn: Greenwood, 1999. Print. Real life application =Without the use of social imagination= Sociological imagination is to place oneself outside of everyday routines and to be able to view one's actions or life from third party perspective. It allows one to make more self-aware decisions rather than be swayed by social norms or factors that may otherwise dictate actions. Lack of sociological imagination can render people very apathetic. Apathy is a \\"spiritual condition\\" which may be the cause of many of their problems. These problems being lack of indignation in scenarios dealing with moral horror, accepting atrocities performed by their leaders (political or familiar), and lacking the ability to react morally to the actions and decisions of their leaders. The Holocaust is a classical example of what happens when a society renders itself to the power of a leader and doesn't use sociological imagination. The Holocaust was based on the principle of absolute power in a dictatorship where society fell victim to apathy and willingly looked away from the horrors they committed. They willfully accepted the decisions taken by Adolf Hitler and carried out the orders because they had lost self-awareness and moral code, then adopting the new social moral code. In doing this they lost the ability to morally react to Hitler's command and in turn slaughtered more than 6,000,000 Jews, other minorities, and disabled persons. The sociological imagination encompasses sociological concepts and information of the world as a society. How we interpret it and how we see it. One must understand the life of an individual and the life of a society simultaneously, in order to make a connection. Thus, making comparison to situations in one's life to the situations in the real world society. This can help make a difference in how we view the world and how we get past specific mental obstacles in order to relate to people, events, and situations that are usually not in our control. This causes us to put ourselves in other people's shoes, thus, solve some of our problems and in turn, personally benefiting ourselves. All of this, comes with the simple differing of our personal situations and societal situations, ones that affect an entire community. In turn, figuring out how to use the daily struggles and things in society to come out making better personal choices and benefiting ourselves, making the world a better place. Which makes life easier, less stressful, and overall, putting us in situations that benefit us and make us happy and in turn doing the right thing as an individual. Sociological perspective Peter L. Berger coined the related term \\"sociological perspective\\". He stated that the sociological perspective was seeing \\"the general in the particular,\\" and that it helped sociologists realize general patterns in the behavior of specific individuals. One can think of the sociological perspective as one's own personal choice and how society plays a role in shaping individuals' lives.John J. Macionis, Linda M. Gerber, \\"Sociology\\", Seventh Canadian Edition, Pearson Canada Uses in films The advantages of using popular films to enhance students' comprehension of sociological topics is widely recognized. Those who teach courses in social problems report using films to teach about war, to aid students in adopting a global perspective, and to confront issues of race relations. There are benefits of using film as part of a multimedia approach to teaching courses in popular culture. It provides students of medical sociology with case studies for hands-on observational experiences. It acknowledges the value of films as historical documentation of changes in cultural ideas, materials, and institutions. Feature films are used in introductory sociology courses to demonstrate the current relevance of sociological thinking and to show how the sociological imagination helps people make sense of their social world. Films, as a familiar medium for students, helps them make connections between their own experiences and broader theory. The underlying assumption is that the sociological imagination is best developed and exercised in the introductory class by linking new materials in the context of conflict theory and functionalism. The sociological imagination as used in the determining and analysis of feature films is somewhat important to the average sociological standpoint, but in channeling the sociological imagination viewpoint, can become a helpful tool in learning about sociological perspectives, thus gaining it in the process. Both sociology and film making really go hand in hand, because of the message and theme that is being portrayed and the viewers reaction because of this thus, creating room for debate in terms of interpretation. For example, creating a film that introduces character from four different angles and situations in life, drawing upon social, psychological, and moral standards of life to bring together one, central ideal that echoes through the overall meaning and reasoning behind the actions taken by individuals, as well as the overall outcome of the story in general. Through the viewing, discussions take place amongst the individuals that view the film with intent on entertainment satisfaction or even the notion to truly understand or interpret the films theme. IN this discussion, plot points are made, conclusions are drawn upon and many minor problems/situations in modern society are indeed fixed, if at the least made into a compromise for the benefit of certain groups, situations, and processes that are ongoing in today's world. So, this creates further sociological imagination to find beneficial and efficient ways to help people, determine things morally permissible or not, and even giving way to new ideas and ways to network people through correlating ideologies and aspects, which can change or even add sociological perspective to someone's state of mind.  Creation  Mills created tips to help conduct valid and reliable sociological study using sociological imagination: # Be a good craftsman: Avoid any rigid set of procedures. Above all, seek to develop and to use the sociological imagination. Avoid the fetishism of method and technique. Urge the rehabilitation of the unpretentious intellectual craftsman, and try to become such a craftsman yourself. Let every man be his own methodologist; let every man be his own theorist; let theory and method again become part of the practice of a craft. Stand for the primacy of the individual scholar; stand opposed to the ascendancy of research teams of technicians. Be one mind that is on its own confronting the problems of man and society. # Avoid the Byzantine oddity of associated and disassociated Concepts, the mannerism of verbiage. Urge upon yourself and upon others the simplicity of clear statement. Use more elaborated terms only when you believe firmly that their use enlarges the scope of your sensibilities, the precision of your references, the depth of your reasoning. Avoid using unintelligibility as a means of evading the making of judgments upon society‚Äîand as a means of escaping your readers' judgments upon your own work. # Make any trans- historical constructions you think your work requires; also delve into sub- historical minutiae. Make up quite formal theory and build models as well as you can. Examine in detail little facts and their relations, and big unique events as well. But do not be fanatic: relate all such work, continuously and closely, to the level of historical reality. Do not assume that somebody else will do this for you, sometime, somewhere. Take as your task the defining of this reality; formulate your problems in its terms; on its level try to solve these problems and thus resolve the issues and the troubles they incorporate. And never write more than three pages without at least having in mind a solid example. # Do not study merely one small milieu after another; study the social structures in which milieux are organized. In terms of these studies of larger structures, select the milieux you need to study in detail, and study them in such a way as to understand the interplay of milieux with structure. Proceed in a similar way in so far as the span of time is concerned. Do not be merely a journalist, however a precise one. Know that journalism can be a great intellectual endeavor, but know also that yours is greater! So do not merely report minute researches into static knife-edge moments, or very short- term runs of time. Take as your time‚Äîspan the course of human history, and locate within it the weeks, years, epochs you examine. # Realize that your aim is a fully comparative understanding of the social structures that have appeared and that do now exist in world history. Realize that to carry it out you must avoid the arbitrary specialization of prevailing academic departments. Specialize your work variously, according to topic, and above all according to significant problem. In formulating and in trying to solve these problems, do not hesitate, indeed seek, continually and imaginatively, to draw upon the perspectives and materials, the ideas and methods, of any and all sensible studies of man and society. They are your studies; they are part of what you are a part of; do not let them be taken from you by those who would close them off by weird jargon and pretensions of expertise. # Always keep your eyes open to the image of man‚Äîthe generic notion of his human nature‚Äîwhich by your work you are assuming and implying; and also to the image of history‚Äîyour notion of how history is being made. In a word, continually work out and revise your views of the problems of history, the problems of biography, and the problems of social structure in which biography and history intersect. Keep your eyes open to the varieties of individuality, and to the modes of epochal change. Use what you see and what you imagine, as the clues to your study of the human variety. # Know that you inherit and are carrying on the tradition of classic social analysis; so try to understand man not as an isolated fragment, not as an intelligible field or system in and of itself. Try to understand men and women as historical and social actors, and the ways in which the variety of men and women are intricately selected and intricately formed by the variety of human societies. Before you are through with any piece of work, no matter how indirectly on occasion, orient it to the central and continuing task of understanding the structure and the drift, the shaping and the meanings, of your own period, the terrible and magnificent world of human society in the second half of the twentieth century. # Do not allow public issues as they are officially formulated, or troubles as they are privately felt, to determine the problems that you take up for study. Above all, do not give up your moral and political autonomy by accepting in somebody else's terms the illiberal practicality of the bureaucratic ethos or the liberal practicality of the moral scatter. Know that many personal troubles cannot be solved merely as troubles, but must be understood in terms of public issues‚Äîand in terms of the problems of history-making. Know that the human meaning of public issues must be revealed by relating them to personal troubles‚Äîand to the problems of the individual life. Know that the problems of social science, when adequately formulated, must include both troubles and issues, both biography and history, and the range of their intricate relations. Within that range the life of the individual and the making of societies occur; and within that range the sociological imagination has its chance to make a difference in the quality of human life in our time.  Other theories  Herbert Blumer, in his work \\"Symbolic interactionism\\": Perspective and method, develops the idea of a non-standard look at the world around us; helping social scientists to understand and analyze the study area. > \\"One can see the empirical world only through some scheme or image of it. > The entire act of scientific study is oriented and shaped by the underlying > picture of the empirical world that is used. This picture sets the selection > and formulation of problems, the determination of what are data, the means > to be used in getting the data, the kinds of relations sought between data, > and the forms in which propositions are cast. In view of this fundamental > and pervasive effect wielded on the entire act of scientific inquiry by the > initiating picture of the empirical world, it is ridiculous to ignore this > picture. The underlying picture of the world is always capable of > identification in the form of a set of premises. These premises are > constituted by the nature given either explicitly or implicitly to the key > objects that comprise the picture. The unavoidable task of genuine > methodological treatment is to identify and assess these premises\\". Howard S. Becker, being a disciple of Blumer, continued to develop his idea of a particular look at the objects under study, and in 1998 wrote a book Tricks of the Trade: How to Think about Your Research While You're Doing It where he gives a list of recommendations that may be useful in conducting sociological research. His main idea is to create a comprehensive picture of the object being studied, phenomenon or social group. To this end, he proposes to pay particular attention on statistical and historical knowledge before the conducting research, use critical thinking, trying to create a universal picture of the world, to make the result of the research understandable and acceptable for everyone.

The molecule detected by the immunoassay is often referred to as an \\"analyte\\" and is in many cases a protein, although it may be other kinds of molecules, of different size and types, as long as the proper antibodies that have the adequate properties for the assay are developed. Analytes in biological liquids such as serum or urine are frequently measured using immunoassays for medical and research purposes. Immunoassays come in many different formats and variations. Immunoassays may be run in multiple steps with reagents being added and washed away or separated at different points in the assay. Multi-step assays are often called separation immunoassays or heterogeneous immunoassays. Some immunoassays can be carried out simply by mixing the reagents and sample and making a physical measurement. Such assays are called homogeneous immunoassays, or less frequently non-separation immunoassays. The use of a calibrator is often employed in immunoassays. Calibrators are solutions that are known to contain the analyte in question, and the concentration of that analyte is generally known. Comparison of an assay's response to a real sample against the assay's response produced by the calibrators makes it possible to interpret the signal strength in terms of the presence or concentration of analyte in the sample. Principle Immunoassays rely on the ability of an antibody to recognize and bind a specific macromolecule in what might be a complex mixture of macromolecules. In immunology the particular macromolecule bound by an antibody is referred to as an antigen and the area on an antigen to which the antibody binds is called an epitope. In some cases, an immunoassay may use an antigen to detect for the presence of antibodies, which recognize that antigen, in a solution. In other words, in some immunoassays, the analyte may be an antibody rather than an antigen. In addition to the binding of an antibody to its antigen, the other key feature of all immunoassays is a means to produce a measurable signal in response to the binding. Most, though not all, immunoassays involve chemically linking antibodies or antigens with some kind of detectable label. A large number of labels exist in modern immunoassays, and they allow for detection through different means. Many labels are detectable because they either emit radiation, produce a color change in a solution, fluoresce under light, or can be induced to emit light. History Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Solomon Berson are credited with the development of the first immunoassays in the 1950s. Yalow accepted the Nobel Prize for her work in immunoassays in 1977, becoming the second American woman to have won the award.Rall JE. Solomon A. Berson. In \\"Biographical Memoirs\\". National Academy of Sciences 1990;59:54-71. . Fulltext. Immunoassays became considerably simpler to perform and more popular when techniques for chemically linked enzymes to antibodies were demonstrated in the late 1960s. In 1983, Professor Anthony Campbell at Cardiff University replaced radioactive iodine used in immunoassay with an acridinium ester that makes its own light: chemiluminescence. This type of immunoassay is now used in around 100 million clinical tests every year worldwide, enabling clinicians to measure a wide range of proteins, pathogens and other molecules in blood samples. By 2012, the commercial immunoassay industry earned and was thought to have prospects of slow annual growth in the 2 to 3 percent range. Labels Immunoassays employ a variety of different labels to allow for detection of antibodies and antigens. Labels are typically chemically linked or conjugated to the desired antibody or antigen. A sandwich ELISA run on a microtitre plate. =Enzymes= Possibly one of the most popular labels to use in immunoassays is enzymes. Immunoassays which employ enzymes are referred to as enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), of which enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) are the most common types. Enzymes used in ELISAs include horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase (AP) or glucose oxidase. These enzymes allow for detection often because they produce an observable color change in the presence of certain reagents. In some cases these enzymes are exposed to reagents which cause them to produce light or Chemiluminescence. =Radioactive isotopes= Radioactive isotopes can be incorporated into immunoassay reagents to produce a radioimmunoassay (RIA). Radioactivity emitted by bound antibody-antigen complexes can be easily detected using conventional methods. RIAs were some of the earliest immunoassays developed, but have fallen out of favor largely due to the difficulty and potential dangers presented by working with radioactivity. =DNA reporters= A newer approach to immunoassays involves combining real- time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) and traditional immunoassay techniques. Called real-time immunoquantitative PCR (iqPCR) the label used in these assays is a DNA probe. =Fluorogenic reporters= Fluorogenic reporters like phycoerythrin are used in a number of modern immunoassays. Protein microarrays are a type of immunoassay that often employ fluorogenic reporters. =Electrochemiluminescent tags= Some labels work via electrochemiluminescence, in which the label emits detectable light in response to electric current. =Label-free immunoassays= While some kind of label is generally employed in immunoassays, there are certain kinds of assays which do not rely on labels, but instead employ detection methods that don't require the modification or labeling the components of the assay. Surface plasmon resonance is an example of technique that can detect binding between an unlabeled antibody and antigens. Another demonstrated labeless immunoassay involves measuring the change in resistance on an electrode as antigens bind to it. Classifications and formats In a competitive, homogeneous immunoassay unlabeled analyte displaces bound labelled analyte, which is then detected or measured. Immunoassays can be run in a number of different formats. Generally, an immunoassay will fall into one of several categories depending on how it is run. =Competitive, homogeneous immunoassays= In a competitive, homogeneous immunoassay, unlabelled analyte in a sample competes with labelled analyte to bind an antibody. The amount of labelled, unbound analyte is then measured. In theory, the more analyte in the sample, the more labelled analyte gets displaced and then measured; hence, the amount of labelled, unbound analyte is proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample. Two-site, noncompetitive immunoassays usually consist of an analyte \\"sandwiched\\" between two antibodies. ELISAs are often run in this format =Competitive, heterogeneous immunoassays= As in a competitive, homogeneous immunoassay, unlabelled analyte in a sample competes with labelled analyte to bind an antibody. In the heterogeneous assays, the labelled, unbound analyte is separated or washed away, and the remaining labelled, bound analyte is measured. =One-site, noncompetitive immunoassays= The unknown analyte in the sample binds with labelled antibodies. The unbound, labelled antibodies are washed away, and the bound, labelled antibodies are measured. The intensity of the signal is directly proportional to the amount of unknown analyte. =Two-site, noncompetitive immunoassays= The analyte in the unknown sample is bound to the antibody site, then the labelled antibody is bound to the analyte. The amount of labelled antibody on the site is then measured. It will be directly proportional to the concentration of the analyte because the labelled antibody will not bind if the analyte is not present in the unknown sample. This type of immunoassay is also known as a sandwich assay as the analyte is \\"sandwiched\\" between two antibodies. Examples =Clinical tests= A wide range of medical tests are immunoassays, called immunodiagnostics in this context. Many home pregnancy tests are immunoassays, which detect the pregnancy marker human chorionic gonadotropin. Other clinical immunoassays include tests that measure levels of CK-MB to assess heart disease, insulin to assess hypoglycemia, prostate-specific antigen to detect prostate cancer, and some are also used for the detection and/or quantitative measurement of some pharmaceutical compounds (see Enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique for more details). =Sports anti-doping analysis= Immunoassays are used in sports anti-doping laboratories to test athletes' blood samples for prohibited recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH, rGH, hGH, GH). Research =Photoacoustic Immunoassay= The photoacoustic immunoassay measures low-frequency acoustic signals generated by metal nanoparticle tags. Illuminated by a modulated light at a plasmon resonance wavelength, the nanoparticles generate strong acoustic signal, which can be measured using a microphone. The photoacoustic immunoassay can be applied to lateral flow tests, which use colloidal nanoparticles.

It allows arbitrary structured data of different types to be assembled in one file for exchanging between arbitrary computers. The ability to arbitrarily serialize data into a self-describing format is reminiscent of XML, but SDXF is not a text format (as XML) ‚Äî SDXF is not compatible with text editors. The maximal length of a datum (composite as well as elementary) encoded using SDXF is 16777215 bytes (one less than 16 MiB). Technical structure format SDXF data can express arbitrary levels of structural depth. Data elements are self-documenting, meaning that the metadata (numeric, character string or structure) are encoded into the data elements. The design of this format is simple and transparent: computer programs access SDXF data with the help of well-defined functions, exempting programmers from learning the precise data layout. The word \\"exchange\\" in the name reflects another kind of transparency: the SDXF functions provide a computer architecture independent conversion of the data. Serializations can be exchanged among computers (via direct network, file transfer or CD) without further measures. The SDXF functions on the receiving side handle architectural adaptation. Structured data is data with patterns predictable more complex than strings of text.It may be argued that \\"structured\\" is used here in the same sense as in structured programming ‚Äî like there are no gotos in a (strictly) structured program, there are no pointers/references in SDXF. This need not be how the name arose, however. Example A commercial example: two companies want to exchange digital invoices. The invoices have the following hierarchical nested structure: INVOICE ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ INVOICE_NO ‚îú‚îÄ DATE ‚îú‚îÄ ADDRESS_SENDER ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ NAME ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ NAME ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ STREET ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ ZIP ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ CITY ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ COUNTRY ‚îú‚îÄ ADDRESS_RECIPIENT ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ NAME ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ NAME ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ STREET ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ ZIP ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ CITY ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ COUNTRY ‚îú‚îÄ INVOICE_SUM ‚îú‚îÄ SINGLE_ITEMS ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ SINGLE_ITEM ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ QUANTITY ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ ITEM_NUMBER ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ ITEM_TEXT ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ CHARGE ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ SUM ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ ... ‚îú‚îÄ CONDITIONS ... Structure The basic element is a chunk. An SDXF serialization is itself a chunk. A chunk can consist of a set of smaller chunks. Chunks are composed of a header prefix of six bytes, followed by data. The header contains a chunk identifier as a 2-byte binary number (Chunk_ID), the chunk length and type. It may contain additional information about compression, encryption and more. The chunk type indicates whether the data consists of text (a string of characters), a binary number (integer or floating point) or if the chunk a composite of other chunks. Structured chunks enable the programmer to pack hierarchical constructions such as the INVOICE above into an SDXF structure as follow: Every named term (INVOICE, INVOICE_NO, DATE, ADDRESS_SENDER, etc.) is given a unique number out in the range 1 to 65535 (2 byte unsigned binary integer without sign). The top/outermost chunk is constructed with the ID INVOICE (that means with the associated numerical chunk_ID) as a structured chunk on level 1. This INVOICE chunk is filled with other chunks on level 2 and beyond: INVOICE_NO, DATE, ADDRESS_SENDER, ADDRESS_RECIPIENT, INVOICE_SUM, SINGLE_ITEMS, CONDITIONS. Some level 2 chunks are structured in turn as for the two addresses and SINGLE_ITEMS. For a precise description see page 2 of the RFC or alternatively here. SDXF allows programmer to work on SDXF structures with a compact function set.

Although the process of mine reclamation occurs once mining is completed, the planning of mine reclamation activities occurs prior to a mine being permitted or started. Mine reclamation creates useful landscapes that meet a variety of goals ranging from the restoration of productive ecosystems to the creation of industrial and municipal resources. In the United States, mine reclamation is a regular part of modern mining practices.Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 Modern mine reclamation minimizes and mitigates the environmental effects of mining. Reclamation processes As part of the life cycle of a surface coal mine, completed mine areas must undergo rehabilitation. When mining ends, operators must restore the land to its approximate original contour (AOC) or leave the land graded and suitable for a ‚Äúhigher and better‚Äù post-mining land use (PMLU) that has been approved as part of the original mining permit application. Exceptions are provided when a community or surface owner is in need of flat or gently rolling terrain. Acceptable post-mining land uses include commercial, residential, recreational, agricultural or public facility improvements.Truth About Surface Mining, Lifecycle of a Coal Surface Mine (http://www.truthaboutsurfacemining.com/SurfaceMining101/Pages/LifecycleSurfaceMine.aspx) =Forestry Reclamation Approach= Within the past decade, a new approach to reforestation ‚Äîthe Forestry Reclamation Approach, or FRA‚Äî has been promoted by state mining agencies and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) as an appropriate and desirable method for reclaiming coal-mined land to support forested land uses under SMCRA. This approach was developed through and is supported by research conducted through the Powell River Project, a cooperative research and education program focused on topics relevant to coal mining and reclamation in Appalachia.Appalachian Regional Reforestation Initiative, Forest Reclamation Advisory No. 1 (http://arri.osmre.gov/FRA/Advisories/FRA_No.1.7-18-07.Revised.pdf) The FRA establishes guidelines for achieving successful reforestation on mined lands, and can be summarized in the following five steps:World Coal, July 2010, ‚ÄïHelping Mother Nature (http://www.truthaboutsurfacemining.com/Environment/WhenMiningEnds/Documents/surface_mining_world_coal.pdf) # Create a suitable rooting medium for good tree growth that is no less than four feet deep and made of topsoil, weathered sandstone, and/or the best available material. # Loosely grade the topsoil or topsoil substitute established in step one to create a non-compacted growth medium. # Use groundcovers that are compatible with growing trees. # Plant two types (or more) of trees: early successional species for wildlife and soil stability, then commercially valuable crop trees. # Use proper tree planting techniques. =Holistic approach= When the top successional species for the local environment is not forest due to local microclimate conditions, reclamation may be better accomplished by establishing rangeland instead. Holistic management has been championed by Dan Dagget and others for mine reclamation in these types of situations. When the best available material is not topsoil, topsoil can be made on site by using early successional species of native hardy perennial grasses and other plants, combined with livestock substituting for the species of wildlife needed to complete the biosystem. # Grade the best available material to the required topography, establishing keylines. # Sow the native species of early successional species of plants and grasses. # Cover the area with a loose layer of hay mulch to provide the initial \\"jump start\\" of forage required for the livestock. # Using keylines as a guide, establish paddocks and implement holistic planned grazing techniques to heal the land. # If the goal is to establish a wildlife area or natural park, as the keystone species begin returning (a process called ecological succession) or are introduced in large enough numbers, livestock can be reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, an integrated approach can be taken that uses the holistic approach to accomplish the first three steps of the forestry reclamation approach. Once those first three steps are accomplished and well- established, the livestock grazing can be reduced or eliminated to allow medium and higher successional species to take root and continue the forestry approach. United States Reclaimed strip mines in southwestern Pennsylvania Prior to 1977, there were no federal laws regulating the surface mining aspect of the coal mining industry. Although many states with mining activity had passed laws to regulate operations, the laws varied from state to state and enforcement was inconsistent. Even as states began to enact more stringent regulatory legislation after World War II, they often lacked the funding to administer and enforce the legislation. Guidelines for post-mining reclamation were generally less stringent than they are today. For example, Colorado began a voluntary reclamation program in 1965, in which the mine operators were expected to act on their own to restore mined lands.Colorado Division of Minerals and Geography, Mine Reclamation in Colorado: An Overview (http://mining.state.co.us/pdfFiles/reg.pdf) = Under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 = The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) is the primary federal law that regulates the environmental effects of coal mining in the United States. It established permitting guidelines for existing and future coal mines as well as a trust fund to finance the reclamation of abandoned mines. SMCRA balances the need to protect the environment from the effects of surface coal mining with the Nation's need for coal as an essential energy source. It ensures that coal mining operations are conducted in an environmentally responsible manner and that the land is adequately reclaimed during and following the mining process. Most coal-mining states now have the primary responsibility to regulate surface coal mining on lands within their jurisdiction, with the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) performing an oversight role.Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Regulating Coal Mines (http://www.osmre.gov/rcm/rcm.shtm) Under SMCRA, prior to receiving a mining permit, operators must present a detailed and comprehensive plan for reclaiming the land after mining has been completed. The reclamation plan must include, among other criteria, the pre-mining condition and use of the land to be mined; the proposed use of the land after reclamation; an estimated time table for the reclamation; and the steps that will be taken to comply with the relevant air and water quality laws. In addition to providing the reclamation plan, operators must also post a performance bond to ensure that monies will be available to complete the reclamation if the operator goes out of business prior to finishing the reclamation or is otherwise unable to complete the reclamation. The amount of the bond must equal the amount of the proposed reclamation plan.U.S. Code, Title 30 ‚Äì Mineral Lands and Mining, Subchapter 1258. Reclamation Plan Requirements (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action;jsessionid=JpQ3T3CRlm3vc0Vn2ynLGRMN9nj1VkTTvhs9K8GdKM6mbGcXdQWh!1067014512!-1849986691?browsePath=Title+30%2FChapter+25%2FSubchapter+V%2FSec.+1258&granuleId;=USCODE-2010-title30-chap25-subchapV- sec1258&packageId;=USCODE-2010-title30&collapse;=true&fromBrowse;=true) The bond is not released to the operator until after the state or federal regulatory office has concluded that the reclamation is successful, which could be over 10 years after the reclamation process has been completed. =Abandoned Mine Lands Program= Funding for the reclamation of abandoned mines is accomplished through a coal production tax. Mine operators must pay a tax of $0.12 per ton for underground mined coal and $0.28 per ton for surfaced mined coal; the proceeds from this tax are put into the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund (created by SMCRA) to pay for the reclamation of abandoned mines. A percentage of the fund is distributed to states with approved reclamation programs for their projects, and the remaining monies are used by the federal government through the OSMRE to reclaim abandoned mines in states without active programs. As of December 15, 2011, OSMRE has provided more than $7.2 billion to reclaim more than 295,000 acres of hazardous high-priority abandoned mine sites and for other purposes of abandoned mine lands have been reclaimed through the OSMRE fund since 1977.Department of the Interior: December 15, 2011 News Release (http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Secretary-Salazar-and-Director- Pizarchik-Announce-485-Million-in-Grants-to-States-and-Tribes-to-Clean-Up- Abandoned-Coal-Mines.cfm) Germany In view of the end of coal mining in Germany in 2018, the Research Institute of Post-Mining (FZN) was set up at the Technische Hochschule Georg Agricola (THGA) in Bochum in 2015. It is the very first institute of its kind in the world, which takes a holistic view of the consequences of mining, and pools the know-how required, in order to shape the post-mining period from a technical, economic and environmental perspective. Here, the focus is placed on the scientific accompaniment of the so-called eternity tasks of coal-mining in the areas of the Ruhr, the Saar as well as in Ibbenb√ºren, where mining, geology, geotechnical engineering, hydrogeology, electrical and information technology experts as well as mining surveyors work together across the different disciplines. The Research Institute of Post- Mining develops monitoring processes at the pithead both and below ground and prepares the scientific principles for a sustainable pit water concept. In this respect, the institute works closely with mining and old companies, as well as authorities, water boards and regional authorities, industrial firms and universities. It also runs its own knowledge management project, which is intended to make mining and post-mining know-how available in a database. Every two years the Research Institute of Post-Mining, together with the Arnsberg local council, organise the ‚ÄúNACHBergbauzeit in NRW‚Äù conference (POST-mining era in NRW). Within the Research Institute of Post-Mining, the THGA also currently offers the world's only Master's degree course in Geotechnical Engineering and Post-Mining, which combines science and engineering, and encompasses rock mechanics, economic geology as well as hydrology, surveying and legal issues.

It is an invasive species in Melbourne, Australia. It lives by sucking the sap of pine trees, mainly the Turkish Pine (Pinus brutia) and, to smaller extent, Aleppo Pine (Pinus halepensis), Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Stone Pine (Pinus pinea). It can be found in the cracks and under the scales of the bark of these trees, hidden under the white cotton-like wax it secretes. Its main form of reproduction is parthenogenesis. The honeydew it produces is an important source of food for forest honey bees, which produce pine honey. In Greece and Turkey, about 60% of the honey production is derived from it. It is the sole member of the genus Marchalina, though some authors argue that M. caucasica which is currently considered a synonym of M. hellenica may be a distinct species.

Ira and his brother Murray serve as two immense influences on the school-age Zuckerman, and the story is told as a contemporary reminiscence between Murray and Nathan on Ira's life. Although a communist, Ira became a star in radio theater. Personal conflicts with McCarthyite politicians, a gossip columnist, and his daughter- addled and manipulative wife all combine to destroy Ira and many of those around him. Claire Bloom controversy Some reviewers, especially those in the British press such as Rachelle Thackray of The Independent and Linda Grant of The Guardian, consider the character of Eve Frame -- the antisemitic wife who destroys Ira -- to be a barely disguised riposte to Roth's ex-wife, Claire Bloom, for her unflattering memoirs, which portrayed Roth as unable to bottle his vanity and incapable of living in the same household with Bloom's daughter, Anna Steiger. However, Frame is portrayed fairly sympathetically in the novel. She destroys Ira's career (unintentionally) after being manipulated by his enemy, Brydon Grant. She later attempts to make amends for having done this. Linda Grant writes of the similarities between Claire Bloom and Eve Frame: > Frame is a Jewish actress, so is Bloom. Frame's second husband is a > financier, so was Bloom's. Eve Frame has a daughter who is a harpist, > Bloom's girl is an opera singer. Ira tells the daughter to move out, Roth > did the same.

He is probably best known for the artwork he has produced for the American punk rock group Dead Kennedys. He also designed the Mot√©ma Music logo. Smith is particularly known for his collaborations with Jello Biafra (former Dead Kennedys frontman) and Alternative Tentacles, for whom he has done numerous covers, inserts, advertisements, flyers, and logos. He is responsible for the famous Alternative Tentacles logo as well as the well-known Dead Kennedys logo and six of their record covers. One of his compositions, God Told Me to Skin You Alive, was used as the cover of Green Day's album Insomniac. A version of an illustration which had been on the back cover of the Biafra/D.O.A. album Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors was later featured on the cover of the April/May 2000 issue of The New Yorker magazine. His work has also appeared in Spin, Playboy, Wired, Utne Reader, Mother Jones, Metro Silicon Valley, Ugly Planet, National Lampoon, and numerous punk fanzines, such as Maximumrocknroll, Seconds, Punk Planet, etc.Winston Smith Winfo: Checkered Past His name is a reference to the character of the same name in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Smith left the U.S. in 1969 to study art in Italy and, struck by the profound social changes that had occurred during his absence from the U.S., adopted the name after returning to America in 1976. In Italy, Smith attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence studying classical Renaissance art and later won a scholarship to study Cinema at the International University of Art (Florence & Rome). For a few years he traveled throughout Italy, roadie-ing for well-known Italian jazz band Perigeo. Over the last 30 years, Winston has had numerous one-man shows in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Antwerp, Berlin and Rome. His work has been included in numerous books chronicling the punk rock era as well as having his work included in art text books plus several book covers, such as Greg Palast's best-sellers \\"The Best Democracy Money Can Buy\\" and \\"Armed Madhouse\\". In addition, Winston has designed over 50 record covers including covers and insert art for Jello Biafra, Burning Brides, George Carlin and Ben Harper. Early life Smith was born and grew up in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He briefly attended (two months) Oklahoma Christian College and Central State University. After spending nearly seven years in Florence, Italy, Smith moved to Boston and then hitchhiked to San Francisco, where he worked as a roadie for numerous San Francisco bands such as Journey, CSN&Y;, The Tubes, Santana and others in the 1970s. Career Smith met fellow artist Jayed Scotti in 1976 and the two collaborated on several projects, producing their self- published magazine Fallout, a satirical pulp-zine, illustrated and written by the duo. They also distributed false posters for non-existent bands and clubs in San Francisco, with the addresses listed on the flyer often located in the Pacific Ocean. The IDOL or Cross of Money image (later used for the Dead Kennedys first EP album \\"In God We Trust, Inc..\\") was created in 1977 in the Fairfax studio of Fallout, as a comment on religious hypocrisy and the worship of money. This was a 3D art piece, fashioned from a real crucifix. Later it was remade as an early color photocopy and submitted to a Berkeley Photocopy show. A friend of Jello Biafra told him of the piece, and later Smith sent him samples of his work. This was the beginnings of the collaboration of Smith and Scotti with the Dead Kennedys. Scotti later became the drummer for The Feederz. To date, Smith has three published collections of his works: Act Like Nothing's Wrong, Artcrime and All Riot on the Western Front.

It fought the Red Army in the surrounding region during the period of September 1918 through to July 1919. History White Chapel Cemetery in Troy, Michigan =Background= U.S. President Woodrow Wilson sent the Polar Bear Expedition to Russia in response to requests from the governments of Great Britain and France to join the Allied Intervention in North Russia (also known as the North Russia Campaign). The British and French had two objectives for this intervention:Joel R. Moore, Harry H. Mead and Lewis E. Jahns, \\"The History of The American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki\\" (Nashville, TN, The Battery Press, 2003), pp. 47‚Äì50 # Preventing Allied war material stockpiles in Archangelsk (originally intended for the recently collapsed Eastern Front) from falling into German or Bolshevik hands # Mounting an offensive to rescue the Czechoslovak Legion, which was stranded along the Trans-Siberian Railroad On July 14, 1918, the U.S. Army's 85th Division left their training camp at Camp Custer, Michigan for the Western Front in France. Three days later, President Wilson agreed to limited participation by American troops in the Allied Intervention with the stipulation that they would only be used for guarding the stockpiled war material. When U.S. Army General John J. Pershing received the directive from President Wilson, he changed the orders for the 339th Infantry Regiment, along with the First Battalion of the 310th Engineers plus a few other ancillary units from the 85th Division. Instead of heading for France, these units were trained and re-outfitted in England with Russian guns and then sent to North Russia. They arrived in Arkhangelsk on September 4, 1918, coming under British command. (Allied expeditionary forces had occupied Arkhangelsk on August 2, 1918.) See American Expeditionary Force, Siberia for information on the 7,950 American soldiers and officers sent to Vladivostok, Russia at the same time. =Expedition= Bolshevik soldier shot by an American guard 8 January 1919 When the British commanders of the Allied Intervention arrived in Arkhangelsk on August 2, 1918, they discovered that the Allied war material had already been moved up the Dvina River by the retreating Bolshevik forces. Therefore, when the American troops arrived one month later, they were immediately used in offensive operations to aid in the rescue of the Czech Legion. The British commanders sent the First Battalion of the 339th Infantry up the Dvina River and the Third Battalion of the 339th up the Vologda Railroad where they engaged and pushed back the Bolshevik forces for the next six weeks. However, these two fronts each became hundreds of miles (kilometers) long and were extremely narrow and difficult to supply, maintain, and protect. By the end of October 1918, they were no longer able to maintain the offensive and acknowledging their fragile situation and the rapid onset of winter, the Allies began to adopt a defensive posture. The Allied commanders also soon realized they would be unable to raise an effective local force of anti-Bolshevik soldiers. Thus they gave up the goal of linking up with the Czech Legion and settled in to hold their gains over the coming winter. During that winter, the Bolshevik army went on the offensive, especially along the Vaga River portion of the Dvina River Front, where they inflicted numerous casualties and caused the Allies to retreat a considerable distance. During their time in North Russia, the American forces suffered more than 210 casualties, including at least 110 deaths from battle, about 30 missing in action, and 70 deaths from disease, 90% of which were caused by the Spanish flu. An October 1919 report gives the casualties as 553: 109 killed in battle; 35 died of wounds; 81 from disease; 19 from accidents/other causes; 305 wounded and 4 POWS (released). =Withdrawal= Following the Allied Armistice with Germany on November 11, 1918, family members and friends of soldiers in the AEF began writing letters to newspapers and circulating petitions to their representatives in the U.S. Congress, asking for the immediate return of the force from North Russia. In turn, the newspapers editorialized for their withdrawal and their congressmen raised the issue in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, aware of not only the change in their mission, but also of the Armistice on the Western Front and the fact that the port of Arkhangelsk was now frozen and closed to shipping, the morale of the American soldiers plummeted. They asked their officers why they were fighting Bolshevik soldiers in Russia and did not receive a clear answer, other than that they had to fight to survive and avoid the Bolshevik army pushing them into the Arctic Ocean. flank attack on Allied troops at Bolshie Ozerki, Russia 8 April 1919 Early in 1919, instances of rumored and actual mutinies in the Allied ranks became frequent. On July 15, 1919, it was reported by the Alaska Daily Empire that rumors of mutiny were \\"bunk\\" and that commander Major Nichols reported ‚ÄúWhat gave rise to the story that Company I, of the regiment, had mutinied was an Incident (sic.) to which an order was misunderstood by a soldier who could not understand English well.‚Äù President Wilson directed the War Department on February 16, 1919, to begin planning the withdrawal of AEF in North Russia from Northern Russia. In March 1919, four American soldiers in Company B of the 339th Infantry drew up a petition protesting their continued presence in Russia and were threatened with court-martial proceedings. U.S. Army Brigadier General Wilds P. Richardson arrived in Arkhangelsk aboard the icebreaker Canada on April 17, 1919, with orders from General Pershing to organize a coordinated withdrawal of American troops \\"...at the earliest possible moment.\\" On May 26, 1919, the first half of 8,000 volunteer members of the British North Russian Relief Force arrived in Arkhangelsk to relieve the American troops. In early June, the bulk of the AEF in North Russia sailed for Brest, France and then for New York City and home‚Äîwhich for two-thirds of them was in the state of Michigan. During the withdrawal, the men of the AEF in North Russia decided to call themselves \\"Polar Bears\\" and were authorized to wear the Polar Bear insignia on their left sleeve. On July 15, 1919, it was reported by the Alaska Daily Empire that forty-six officers and 1,495 men of the Polar Bear Expedition, were the first American troops to return home from service in Northern Russia, arrived in Hoboken, New Jersey aboard the Von Steuben. The AEF in North Russia officially disbanded on August 5, 1919. Several years after the American troops were withdrawn from Russia, President Warren G. Harding called the expedition a mistake and blamed the previous administration.American soldiers faced Red Army on Russian soil, Army Times, September 16, 2002 =Aftermath= A year after all of the expedition members had returned home, in 1920 Polar Bear veterans began lobbying their state and Federal governments to obtain funds and the necessary approvals to retrieve the bodies of at least 125 of their fellow American soldiers which were then believed to have been buried in Russia and left behind. By that time, 112 sets of remains had already been transferred to the United States. By 1929, additional research found that 226 fallen \\"polar bears\\" had originally been buried in North Russia,The Tuscaloosa News September 10, 1929 with a total of approximately 130 sets of U.S. soldier remains then estimated to still be buried in North Russia. Hampered by the lack of diplomatic recognition between the United States and the Soviet Union, it took many years before they finally received permission. An expedition under the auspices of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) was successful in organizing and conducting a recovery mission in the autumn of 1929 that found, identified and brought out the remains of 86 U.S. soldiers. Fourteen remains of AEF in North Russia soldiers were shipped by the Soviet Union to the U.S. in 1934,The Pittsburgh Press August 17, 1934 which reduced the number of U.S soldiers still buried in North Russia to about 30. The remains of 56 AEF soldiers were eventually re-buried in plots surrounding the Polar Bear Memorial by sculptor Leon Hermant in White Chapel Memorial Cemetery, Troy, Michigan in a ceremony on May 30, 1930. Harold Gunnes, who was born in 1899, died on March 11, 2003. Gunnes was believed to have been the last living American to have fought in the Allied Intervention near the port of Arkhangelsk on the White Sea.

All species of lemur are indigenous to the island. The Golden-brown mouse lemur is isolated to the forest reserve of Ankarafantsika National Park, a dry deciduous forest located in northwestern Madagascar.Zimmermann, E. S. Cepok, N. Rakotoarison, V.

The golden-brown mouse lemur‚Äôs habitat is well dispersed among sexes and family groups, showing little sign of intra- or interspecific competition among overlapping territories. In a 2009 study by S. Thoren et al. showed only lactating females were seen building nests, but studies suggest non-lactating females will also. Nest building will take place in the early hours of the night and will take approximately 60 minutes to build. The nests are constructed of small branches and leaves from surrounding vegetation. They will be occupied by lactating or dominant females, their offspring and mixed lineage group members for a period of 36 days. Anatomy and physiology The golden-brown mouse lemur has been categorized as a separate species based on morphology and genetics.Pastorini, J., R. Martin, P. Ehresmann, E. Zimmermann, M. Forstner. ‚ÄúMolecular Phylogeny of the Lemur Family Cheirogaleidae (Primates) Based on Mitochondrial DNA Sequences‚Äù. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 19, 2001, 45-56. Its dorsal side is golden-brown, and yellowish-white ventrally. It has a white stripe running from the lower forehead to the muzzle. It weighs 40-70g depending on the season, and is similar in appearance to the gray mouse lemur, though it has a longer, thinner tail. It is unable to store fat in its tail like other mouse lemurs. It travels through the forest by leaping, unlike the gray mouse lemur. It is a nocturnal species, and builds its nests in dense patches of vines or dead leaves. Social distribution There is a great variation in social patterns among nocturnal lemurs; the golden-brown mouse lemur is exceptional with its mixed-sex sleeping groups. M. ravelobensis has a well dispersed, inter-sexual sleeping pattern that promotes promiscuity was first categorized in 2004 by researchers Weidt, et al. The golden-brown mouse lemur sleeps predominantly in tree branches or makes nests. Because of this exposed environment male/female sleeping groups exist to aid in both thermoregulation of nests and decrease the chances of predation. This observation has also been noted by Radespiel et al. (2003). Within the sleeping groups, there are several nest locations that individuals will switch between, but the members within the community never change. This social spatial distribution leads to overlapping territories that develop a multi-family community within a given range. Within this given range, studies show little or no competition between males during mating season . Though golden-brown mouse lemurs exhibit a social sleeping pattern, their active nocturnal lifestyle is typically solitary.

Part of the Central Ward, it is unofficially bounded by South Orange Avenue in the north, Avon Avenue in the south, Martin Luther King Boulevard and University Avenue on the east, and Bergen Street in the west. At one point, this was the \\"shtetl\\" of Eastern European Jews. The Jews of Newark were distinct from the Jews of New York City in that most worked as peddlers, grocers, tailors, mechanics, technicians, artisans, jewelers, and repairmen, as opposed to factory workers. Gradually, the Jews of Newark grew in affluence, and many moved south to Weequahic and Hillside, though lower middle-class Jews were to be found in the neighborhood as late as the 1950s. From the 1940s on, many African Americans from Virginia and the Carolinas moved here during the Great Migration (African-American), attracted by the World War II boom for such local corporations as Westinghouse. By the 1967 Newark civil unrest, this was a slum, with a high concentration of housing projects in the section east of Bergen Street. Springfield/Belmont's projects were demolished in the 1990s and replaced by small scale public and private housing. Springfield/Belmont is close to 100% African American, and one of Newark's neighborhoods most drastically affected by white flight. Springfield/Belmont contains many historic buildings along Martin Luther King Boulevard, formerly known as High Street. Describing the street from north to south, a visitor would see the Art-Deco extravagance of Arts High School, classically inspired St. Agnes Greek church, the magnificent Victorian architecture of the Krueger-Scott Mansion, the Beaux-Arts Feigenspan Mansion, a Neo-Classical former synagogue, and finally the Moorish Revival Prince Street Synagogue. Built for a German brewer, the Krueger-Scott mansion was the most expensive home ever built in Newark. Plans are afoot to turn it into an American cultural center. The 1884 Prince Street Synagogue, former home of Congregation Oheb Shalom, later Metropolitan Baptist Church, at 32 Prince Street, has been restored and converted to a nature center for Newark by the Greater Newark Conservancy. The yard of the old synagogue has been turned into a beautiful community garden. It also features a pond with fish, frogs, turtles, and salamanders in it. The most severe destruction from the Newark civil unrest occurred on Bergen Street between Clinton Avenue and Springfield Avenue. Since the millennium, new construction of Society Hill and the Springfield Marketplace have replaced many abandoned lots.https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/realestate/in-newark-a- new-chapter-unfolding.html A Food desert is a neighborhood where there is a shortage of places to buy food. Despite the closure of a new supermarket one year after its opening, several have opened or are planned to open in the city. The Springfield branch of the Newark Public Library is located in the Springfield/Belmont neighborhood. The Springfield Avenue Marketplace is a $94 million mixed-use development that opened in 2016 and features a Shop Rite, among other stores.

(With essays by Jessica Hicks and Elizabeth Yale from the Awards' 60-year anniversary blog.) It is based on the true story of Polish actress Helena Modjeska (called Maryna Zalewska in the book), her arrival in California in 1876, and her ascendancy to American stardom. Alleged plagiarism Sontag was accused of plagiarism by Ellen Lee, who discovered at least twelve passages in the 387-page book that were similar to passages in four other books about Modjeska, including My Mortal Enemy, a novel by Willa Cather. (Cather wrote: \\"When Oswald asked her to propose a toast, she put out her long arm, lifted her glass, and looking into the blur of the candlelight with a grave face, said: 'To my coun-n-try!'\\" Sontag wrote, \\"When asked to propose a toast, she put out her long arm, lifted her glass, and looking into the blur of the candlelight, crooned, 'To my new country!'\\" \\"Country,\\" muttered Miss Collingridge. \\"Not 'coun-n-try.'\\") The quotations were presented without credit or attribution. Sontag said about using the passages, \\"All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain. I've used these sources and I've completely transformed them. I have these books. I've looked at these books. There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.\\"Carvajal, Doreen (May 27, 2002) \\"So Whose Words Are They?

Publishers Weekly wrote, \\"As she did in The Volcano Lover, Sontag crafts a novel of ideas in which real figures from the past enact their lives against an assiduously researched, almost cinematically vivid background. Here again her signal achievement is to offer fresh and insightful commentary on the social and cultural currents of an age, with a distinctive understanding of how historical events forged character and destiny.\\" Sarah Kerr of The New York Times gave the book modest praise, writing, \\"Almost but not quite as lively as in The Volcano Lover, Sontag's prose here is lithe, playful: in spite of the listless plot, this book has flow. Indeed, In America reads so smoothly that one could almost accuse Sontag of placing too few demands on her readers. Stimulating ideas, as usual, lurk around every corner. But they tend to arrive pre-interpreted.\\" She added, \\"Sentence by sentence, scene to scene, the writing in In America is utterly nimble. It's the ideas, somehow, that lag behind.\\" John Sutherland of The Guardian was more critical, however, remarking, \\"Let's face it: if this was a first novel by a literary unknown it would have been lucky to make it into print. What makes In America an object of interest is less its page-turning readability than its significance as the latest move in Susan Sontag's brilliant career.\\" References 1999 novels National Book Award for Fiction winning works Works by Susan Sontag Novels set in California Novels set in the 19th century Novels involved in plagiarism controversies ","title":"In America (novel)"},{"id":"1375309","text":"Peter Pan is a brand of peanut butter produced by Conagra Brands and named after the J.

This would not be the first time: in the mid-1950s, when Peter Pan cosponsored ABC's Disneyland TV series, Tinker Bell often appeared in their ads during the program.

M. Barrie's play or the musical made from it, were it not for the fact that the model used for the peanut butter label appeared very feminine, with long hair and a green skirt, unlike the actresses who had played Peter onstage.

(AMS) is a non-profit scientific organization established to encourage and support the research activities of both amateur and professional astronomers who are interested in the field of meteor astronomy. Its affiliates observe, monitor, collect data on, study, and report on meteors, meteor showers, meteoric fireballs, and related meteoric phenomena. The society was founded in 1911 by Charles P. Olivier of the Leander McCormick Observatory. The initial enrollment was fifteen members. These were recruited by Dr. Olivier by letter. The first paper based on the observations of the members appeared in the Astronomical Journal in 1912, describing the Œ∑ Aquarid meteor shower. In 1926, Dr. Olivier began to publish meteor notes from the society on a nearly monthly basis in Popular Astronomy magazine under the title \\"Monthly Notes\\". This continued until his editor, Curvin H. Gingrich, died. Some time prior to 1932, Dr. Olivier began appointing regional directors to facilitate the data collection for the society. A director was appointed to the Pacific Northwest region in 1932. Initially this consisted of Washington and Oregon states, but later came to include the western provinces of Canada plus Idaho and Montana. In 1938, the Canadian provinces were withdrawn from the society, while California was added. This western division was headquartered at the University of Oregon in Eugene. In 1960, Dr. Olivier published the first catalogue of hourly meteor rates based upon the data collected by the society members from 1901 to 1958. The second catalogue was published in 1965, which included data up to 1963. During the late 1970s, David Meisel became Executive Director of the society. The headquarters for the society was relocated to Geneseo, New York. The society research was expanded to include radio meteor studies, then spectroscopy of meteors. The society publishes observations and scientific interpretations quarterly in Meteor Trails, The Journal of American Meteor Society. Once per year they give the American Meteor Society Award to a person who has contributed to research on meteors. They also provide an annual research grant to a student of SUNY-Geneseo who has contributed to meteor research or to the AMS.

In 1989, MacKay became Minister of Public Works. From 1989 to 1991, he was also responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency Act. The opposition Liberals and New Democratic Party often accused MacKay of doling out patronage appointments. While no wrongdoing was ever proven, MacKay was removed from the ACOA portfolio in 1991. From 1991 to 1993, he remained Public Works minister and was given responsibility for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. MacKay retired from Cabinet when Mulroney's tenure as party leader ended in 1993, and did not run in the 1993 election. Elmer MacKay's son, Peter, was the Conservative member for Central Nova, a re-creation of the same riding his father once represented. His son has served as minister responsible for ACOA, and for Prince Edward Island, positions previously held by his father. Peter had also served as the final leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. Controversy MacKay is a longtime associate of former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and German businessman Karlheinz Schreiber, who were negotiating the purchase of Airbus aircraft for Air Canada in 1988. As a result of subsequent Royal Canadian Mounted Police charges against Mulroney for accepting kickbacks on this transaction, a federal inquiry was launched, which found that Mulroney had accepted at least $300,000 in cash from Schreiber after the transaction. Mulroney's defence stated these payments were in return for consulting services. Documents show that MacKay drafted a letter that was eventually released by Schreiber as evidence that Scheiber's and Mulroney's business dealings were legitimate. It is not known why MacKay drafted a letter that was later offered as evidence and supposedly written by Schreiber. Evidence tabled at the Airbus inquiry included entries in Schreiber‚Äôs diary that indicated Schreiber had made phone calls to MacKay on the same dates during which the first two Airbus meetings were held between Mulroney and Schreiber. MacKay has confirmed he had lunch with Mulroney and Schreiber the day of the third meeting. In addition, Schreiber‚Äôs diary shows he made phone calls to MacKay on two days in July 1993 when he made banking transactions in Switzerland to obtain money to pay Mulroney. Although MacKay was closely involved with Mulroney and Schreiber during the time of the Airbus purchases, he has never been formally charged for wrongdoing in the scandal.

Background  The character of Sally Lockhart first appears in The Ruby in the Smoke, a play Pullman wrote for performance by a secondary school. In the play, sixteen-year-old Sally Lockhart attempts to investigate her father's apparently accidental death. In the course of her investigation she uncovers her father's connections to the opium trade, the Indian Mutiny, and a cursed ruby. Philip Pullman was attracted to the story and characters so much that he rewrote the play as a children's book; he later extended the story into a series of four books. Character Sally Lockhart is first introduced in The Ruby in the Smoke, the first of the four novels in the Sally Lockhart Quartet. The book begins in London in 1872, where Pullman states Lockhart is \\"sixteen or so\\". Physically, Lockhart is described as being \\"uncommonly pretty\\"; she has blonde hair, dark brown eyes and is \\"slender and pale\\". In the beginning, Sally is placed under the care of her father's second cousin, a widow named Caroline Rees who insists upon being called \\"Aunt Caroline\\". The two reside at Peveril Square, Islington, until Sally moves out during the beginning of The Ruby in the Smoke. She befriends Jim Taylor, an office boy at her father's old shipping firm; Frederick Garland, a brilliant photographer; and his sister Rosa, a caring actress. Sally's high intelligence opens a career path for her as a financial consultant, an extremely difficult job for a woman to obtain considering women at this point still were refused the right to vote. Sally Lockhart realises she loves Frederick Garland almost too late in The Shadow in the North; they consummate their love and conceive their child hours before Frederick is killed in a fire started by associates of Axel Bellmann. Sally mourns the fact she and Fred never had a chance to marry and that their daughter, named Harriet, is illegitimate. At the end of The Tiger in the Well, Sally realises that Jewish-Hungarian socialist and journalist, Daniel Goldberg, is the only man who would ever measure up to Fred's bravery, understanding, and love, and that Fred would have liked Daniel very much. She decides at the end of the book that she should marry Daniel. It is unknown whether Sally Goldberg, n√©e Lockhart, converts to Judaism on her marriage to Daniel. She also appears in the book The Tin Princess. Sally appears in all four of the books, although her appearance in The Tin Princess is only brief, and the importance of her role is considerably diminished compared to previous titles.  The books  =The Ruby in the Smoke= In 1872, Sally becomes involved in numerous intrigues involving the identity of her father, the British opium trade in India, and a mysterious ruby. =The Shadow in the North= It is 1878. Following a fraudulent medium's ramblings, a Scottish magician's visions, and a transport ship's disappearance, Sally finds that she must seek help from old friends, and finds herself losing all she holds dear trying to uncover the truth behind the North Star, the Steam Gun, and the mysterious businessman Axel Bellmann. =The Tiger in the Well= It is 1881. A trap has been sprung, a trap which has been in preparation for years. The barely human Tzaddik is behind this, and his demons are far greater than anything Sally Lockhart can muster. With the law, the Tzaddik's henchmen, and luck against her, she is forced to go undercover, leaving behind her family and friends as she is sucked into the well... =The Tin Princess= It is 1882. Jim finds Adelaide, a girl who went missing as a poor urchin during Sally's first encounter with danger, and finds that she has married into the royal family of Razkavia, a small country near Germany. However, resentment is rife within the palace, and plots develop to dethrone the family and join Germany. Only the Eagle can stop them. Character histories =Jim Taylor= A loveable Cockney ragamuffin, Jim is an avid theatergoer who loves stories and regularly falls in love, his adult career alternating between working at a theatre and submitting self-penned plays and working as a private detective. He is courageous and outgoing and has an ability to see a person's true nature long before anyone else. He looks up to Sally and Fred. In The Shadow in the North he breaks his leg when he falls from a window whilst trying to save Fred. While looking for Sally in the ruins of the North Star factory, he strains his leg too much and causes him to have a limp for the rest of his life, although he is still physically capable in a fight. In The Tin Princess, he accompanies the long-lost Adelaide and her new husband to her husband's kingdom, with Jim eventually marrying Adelaide after her husband is killed and Adelaide removed from the throne. Jim is in all of the books, although his appearance in The Tiger in the Well is only brief as he was away on a trip with Webster Garland for much of the novel. Jim was played by [Matt Smith (actor)Matt Smith] in the TV series. =Frederick Garland= A photographer with an imaginative streak and a wonderful personality. Although he has feelings for Sally, they almost always argue, Sally torn between her admiration for his strength and compassion and her frustration at his occasionally childish behavior, but their friendship is still strong. Although they accept their feelings for each other, he dies in a fire caused by Axel Bellmann midway through The Shadow in the North, causing Sally to murder Bellmann. Sally's pain for most of The Shadow in the North and The Tiger in the Well revolves around the fact that had Fred survived the fire, the couple would have married and brought up their daughter, Harriet Rosa Lockhart, together. Frederick appears in The Ruby in the Smoke and The Shadow in the North. =Ah Ling/Hendrik van Eeden/Tzaddik= A ruthless pirate and murderer, of Dutch/Chinese descent, who illegally ships low-quality opium to Europe from the East. Sally thought that she killed him in The Ruby in the Smoke, but did not. As we later discover, her bullet pierced his spinal cord, and he was paralyzed. In The Tiger in the Well, he has assumed the name \\"Tzaddik\\" and, amongst other organised criminal activities, runs a prostitution ring throughout Europe. He also has a mysterious tiny servant, rumoured to be a dybbuk, an evil spirit with its origins in Jewish mythology, although it is later revealed to be a monkey. The dybbuk is killed by the Tzaddik's valet, Michelet; he had been intending to abduct Harriet to take the monkey's place as his personal servant as part of his revenge against Sally, but the plan fell through. He himself is killed in the Blackbourne River Flood. Ah Ling/Hendrik van Eeden/Tzaddik is in The Ruby in the Smoke and The Tiger in the Well. =Theophilus 'Trembler' Molloy= An ex-pickpocket, Trembler works for the Garlands in The Ruby in the Smoke and is characteristically nervous, hence his nickname. He takes to Adelaide very quickly and loves her like a daughter. The stereographic picture of Trembler with Adelaide on his knee is a clue to the true identity of the 'Cockney Queen' in \\"The Tin Princess\\". Trembler and Mrs. Molloy are one of Sally's ports of call in The Tiger in the Well as they now own a boarding house and she arranges to hide with them after running from her court appearance with Harriet. Trembler is not seen or mentioned in the BBC adaptations. =Rosa Bedwell/Garland= Fred's sister. She was a small-time actress, and later married a clergyman, Nicholas Bedwell, the twin brother of Matthew Bedwell, the unfortunate opium-addicted sailor from The Ruby in the Smoke. She and Reverend Bedwell went on to have two children, May and Matthew Bedwell. She helps Sally and Harriet (Sally's daughter, Rosa's niece) through a court case in The Tiger in the Well. Rosa and her brother, Fred, were originally disowned by their parents for taking up career choices that their parents did not agree with and were supported by their father's brother, Webster Garland. Rosa was accepted by her parents after giving up the stage and marrying Reverend Bedwell. Although she loves her husband, Rosa still longs for the stage and puts on parish pageants and pastorals (The Tiger in the Well). =Becky Winter= Born in Razkavia, Becky is employed by a man called Herr Strauss to teach Miss Bevan German. After the first lesson she discovers the danger that Prince Rudolf (a.k.a. Herr Strauss) is in. She befriends Jim Taylor (a consulting detective), Sally Goldberg (a financial consultant), Prince Rudolf (the crown prince of Razkavia), and his Cockney wife Adelaide Bevan (an old friend of Jim and Sally's). =Adelaide Bevan= East end orphan who is a servant of Mrs. Holland in The Ruby in the Smoke. Once Mrs. Holland dies, she is still not found until the later books. She appears in The Tin Princess as Crown Princess and later Queen of Razkavia. She later agrees to marry Jim after political strife forces her to abdicate her throne, with her friend Becky suggesting that Adelaide could become an actress.

The history of various such theories is the subject of this article. Overview Conception of what constitutes capitalism has changed significantly over time, as well as being dependent on the political perspective and analytical approach adopted by the observer in question. Adam Smith focused on the role of enlightened self-interest (the \\"invisible hand\\") and the role of specialization in promoting the efficiency of capital accumulation. Ayn Rand maintained that capitalism is the only morally socio- political system because it frees people to act in their rational self- interest, and asserted that no politico-economic system in history has ever proved its value so eloquently or has benefited mankind so greatly. She defined it as a social system based on the recognition of individual rights, including property rights, in which all property is privately owned, and adduced that capitalism is the unknown ideal: people not knowing its nature, with the tacit compliance and silence of those who know better, and being its foundations battered by a flood of altruism, which is the cause of modern's world collapse.Capitalism, Ayn Rand Lexicon Robert LeFevre, an American libertarian and primary theorist of autarchism, defined capitalism as savings and capital‚Äîin essence‚Äîas savings made by men, which are then invested in the tools of production.Robert LeFevre on Capitalism Some proponents of capitalism (like Milton Friedman) emphasize the role of free markets, which, they claim, promote freedom and democracy. For many (like Immanuel Wallerstein), capitalism hinges on the extension into a global dimension of an economic system in which goods and services are traded in markets and capital goods belong to non-state entities. For others (like Karl Marx), it is defined by the creation of a labor market in which most people must sell their labor power in order to make a living. As Marx argued (see also Hilaire Belloc), capitalism also differs from other market economies that feature private ownership through the concentration of the means of production in the hands of a few or many. Adam Smith Adam Smith is considered the first theorist of what we commonly refer to as capitalism. His 1776 work, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, theorized that within a given stable system of commerce and evaluation, individuals would respond to the incentive of earning more by specializing their production. These individuals would naturally, without specific state intervention, \\"direct ... that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value.\\" This would enable the whole economy to become more productive, and it would therefore be wealthier. Smith argued that protecting particular producers would lead to inefficient production, and that a national hoarding of specie (i.e. cash in the form of coinage) would only increase prices, in an argument similar to that advanced by David Hume. His systematic treatment of how the exchange of goods, or a market, would create incentives to act in the general interest, became the basis of what was then called political economy and later economics. It was also the basis for a theory of law and government that gradually superseded the mercantilist regime then prevalent. Smith asserts that when individuals make a trade they value what they are purchasing more than they value what they are giving in exchange for a commodity. If this were not the case, then they would not make the trade but retain ownership of the more valuable commodity. This notion underlies the concept of mutually- beneficial trade where it is held that both sides tend to benefit by an exchange. Adam Smith is often described as the \\"father of capitalism\\" (and the \\"father of economics\\"). He described his own preferred economic system as \\"the system of natural liberty.\\" However, Smith defined \\"capital\\" as stock, and \\"profit\\" as the just expectation of retaining the revenue from improvements made to that stock. Smith also viewed capital improvement as being the proper central aim of the economic and political system. Karl Marx A critique of the results of capitalism was formulated by Karl Marx. According to Marx, the treatment of labor as a commodity led to people valuing things more in terms of their price rather than their usefulness (see commodity fetishism), and hence to an expansion of the system of commodities. Much of the history of late capitalism involves what David Harvey called the \\"system of flexible accumulation\\" in which more and more things become commodities, the value of which is determined through the process of exchange rather than their use. For example, not only pins are commodities; shares in the ownership of a factory that manufactures pins become commodities; then options on the stock issued in the company that operates the factory become commodities; then portions of the interest rate attached to bonds issued by the company become commodities, and so on. Speculation in these abstract commodities then drives the allocation of materials and labor. Marx believed that the extension of the labor theory of value indicated owners of productive means would exploit workers by depriving them of the full value that workers themselves create. According to Marx, surplus value is the difference between the value that the worker has created and the wage that the worker receives from his/her employer. In modern times, the labor theory of value has been discredited in favor marginalism. Historical development During the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there was a gradual movement in Europe and in the states that Europeans had founded, for the reduction of trade barriers, in particular restrictions on production and labor, the use of non-standard weights and measures, restrictions on the formation of new businesses, and the curtailing of royal prerogatives that interfered with the conduct of commerce. Two parallel doctrines emerged to describe and justify this process. One was the legal doctrine that the rightful owner of land or exerciser of a property right was the one that could make the best economic use of it, and that this principle must be reflected in the property laws of each nation. The other was the political doctrine of laissez-faire economics, namely that all coercive government regulation of the market represents unjustified interference, and that economies would perform best with government only playing a defensive role in order to ensure the operation of free markets. The next major revision of the theoretical basis of capitalism began in the late 19th century with the expansion of corporations and finance, the globalization of production and markets, and the increasing desire to tap the productive capacity of the capital sectors of economies in order to secure the markets and resources required to continue economic growth. Many, particularly the wealthy, came to view the state as a vehicle for improving business conditions, securing markets, and gaining access to scarce materials‚Äîeven when such objectives could only be achieved through military force. In the 1920s this philosophy found its most publicly prominent voice in President Calvin Coolidge's assertion that \\"the business of America is business\\". Critics of this period label it \\"corporatism\\", while its adherents generally regard it as a logical extension of the \\"laissez-faire\\" principles of natural liberty. Capitalism and imperialism J. A. Hobson, a British liberal writing at the time of the fierce debate concerning imperialism during the Second Boer War, observed the spectacle of the \\"Scramble for Africa\\" and emphasized changes in European social structures and attitudes as well as capital flow, though his emphasis on the latter seems to have been the most influential and provocative. His so- called accumulation theory, very influential in its day, suggested that capitalism suffered from under-consumption due to the rise of monopoly capitalism and the resultant concentration of wealth in fewer hands, which he argued gave rise to a misdistribution of purchasing power. His thesis called attention to Europe's huge, impoverished industrial working class, which was typically far too poor to consume goods produced by an industrialized economy. His analysis of capital flight and the rise of mammoth cartels later influenced Vladimir Lenin in his book Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism, which has become a basis for the neo-Marxist analysis of imperialism. Contemporary World-Systems theorist Immanuel Wallerstein perhaps addresses better Hobson's counter-arguments without degrading Hobson's underlying inferences. Accordingly, Wallerstein's conception of imperialism as a part of a general and gradual extension of capital investment from the center of the industrial countries to an overseas periphery coincides with Hobson's. According to Wallerstein, Mercantilism became the major tool of semi-peripheral, newly industrialized countries such as Germany, France, Italy, and Belgium. Wallerstein thus perceives formal empire as performing a function that was analogous to that of the mercantilist drives of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in England and France; consequently, the expansion of the Industrial Revolution contributed to the emergence of an era of aggressive national rivalry, leading to the late nineteenth-century scramble for Africa and the acquisition of formal empires. Democracy, the state, and legal frameworks The relationship between the state, its formal mechanisms, and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. Hernando de Soto is a contemporary economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded. According to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets transform into capital, which in turn is used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy. A number of Marxian economists have argued that the Enclosure Acts in England, and similar legislation elsewhere, were an integral part of capitalist primitive accumulation and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism.. New institutional economics, a field pioneered by Douglass North, stresses the need of a legal framework in order for capitalism to function optimally, and focuses on the relationship between the historical development of capitalism and the creation and maintenance of political and economic institutions. In new institutional economics and other fields focusing on public policy, economists seek to judge when and whether governmental intervention (such as taxes, welfare, and government regulation) can result in potential gains in efficiency. According to Gregory Mankiw, a New Keynesian economist, governmental intervention can improve on market outcomes under conditions of \\"market failure,\\" or situations in which the market on its own does not allocate resources efficiently. Market failure occurs when an externality is present and a market either underproduces a product with a positive externality, or overproduces a product that generates a negative externality. Air pollution, for instance, is a negative externality that cannot be incorporated into markets as the world's air is not owned and then sold for use to polluters. So, too much pollution could be emitted and people not involved in the production pay the cost of the pollution instead of the firm that initially emitted the air pollution. Critics of market failure theory, like Ronald Coase, Harold Demsetz, and James M. Buchanan argue that government programs and policies also fall short of absolute perfection. In this view, market failures are often small, and government failures are sometimes large. It is therefore the case that imperfect markets are often better than imperfect governmental alternatives. While all nations currently have some kind of market regulations, the desirable degree of regulation is disputed. The relationship between democracy and capitalism is a contentious area in theory and popular political movements. The extension of universal adult male suffrage in 19th century Britain occurred along with the development of industrial capitalism, and democracy became widespread at the same time as capitalism. Research on the democratic peace theory further indicates that capitalist democracies rarely make war with one another and have little internal violence. However critics of the democratic peace theory note that democratic capitalist states may fight infrequently or never with other democratic capitalist states because of political similarity or political stability rather than because they are democratic (or capitalist). Authoritarian regimes have been able to manage economic growth without making concessions to greater political freedom.

It is generally associated with reduced employment levels, which can have a significant negative impact on local economies. It is also the period when the majority of mine reclamation is completed, making the land safe and useful again. In South Africa, which is a major mining country, closure planning has not yet been formalized. This has led to a range of unintended consequences that have the potential to become sovereign risk if not adequately managed. Closure planning, a relative newcomer to mine planning, continues throughout the life of a mine, starting with conceptual closure plans prior to production, periodic updates throughout the life of the mine, and a final decommissioning plan. This is captured more coherently in the Australian Model to mine closure.http://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/documents/Shed_env_guide_closure.pdf At most mines, progressive reclamation over the life of the mine is used to reduce the reclamation burden at closure. Most mine shafts are capped, meaning a large concrete plug around 3 feet thick is placed over the shaft to cover it and stop fatal accidents from occurring. Some mines are capped using large metallic grills, this usual occurs on deep level shafts so airflow through the deep tunnels helps prevent subsidence. Older mines typically used wood beams, a foot or more thick, under loose rock and dirt as caps. Over time the wood rots and sinkholes can develop. These mines are typically recapped with concrete, steel plates, expanding foam, or a combination of each. Steel plates are used primarily on horizontal shafts, but are used on vertical shafts occasionally. Doors are added if access is needed. Holes are cut into the plate to allow for drainage as well as for a bat entrance. Expanding foam is used primarily with vertical shafts where the use of the shaft is no longer desired. It forms a plug 6 feet or more thick. A pipe through the plug allows for pressure equalization as well as for water drainage, or even as a bat entrance if necessary. Closure planning has two distinct components. On-site planning is mostly about environmental rehabilitation and returning the landform to a reasonable condition where vegetative recovery is enhanced. Off- mine closure is about loss of livelihood, which is a more complex issue. An element of this is generating an offset against the high clost of environmental remediation, which in certain cases can exceed the value of the mineral that was mined in the first place.Adler, R., Claassen, M., Godfrey, L. & Turton, A.R. 2007.

The predominant madhhab in the country is the Maliki school. Overview Majority Muslims in Tunisia nominally belonging to the Sunni Malikite madhhab, but a small number of Ibadhi Muslims (Kharijites) still exist among the Berber-speakers of Jerba Island. There is no reliable data on the number of practicing Muslims. There is a small indigenous Shia (for example, Muhammad al-Tijani) and Sufi Muslim community, but no statistics regarding their size. Reliable sources report that many Sufis left the country shortly after independence when their religious buildings and land reverted to the Government (as did those of Orthodox Islamic foundations). Although the Sufi community is small, its tradition of mysticism permeates the practice of Islam throughout the country. During annual Ramadan festivals, Sufis provide public cultural entertainment by performing religious dances. =Government and Islam= The January 2014 Constitution states the country's ‚Äúreligion is Islam.‚Äù It designates the government as the ‚Äúguardian of religion‚Äù and requires that the president be Muslim. The constitution guarantees freedom of belief, conscience, and exercise of religious practices, and the neutrality of mosques and houses of worship from partisan exploitation. It stipulates the state's commitment to disseminate the values of moderation and tolerance, protect holy sites, and prevent takfir (Muslim accusations of apostasy against other Muslims). The constitution admits the possibility of restrictions on religious freedom, giving general reasons for this as protecting the rights of third parties, national defense, and public security, morality, and health. The government controls and subsidizes mosques and pays the salaries of prayer leaders. The President appoints the Grand Mufti of the Republic. Four religious holidays are included among the national holidays in Tunisia: Eid al-Adha, Eid al-Fitr, Muharram, and Mawlid. Islamic religious education is mandatory in public schools, but the religious curriculum for secondary school students also includes the history of Judaism and Christianity from the Islamic perspective and sources. The Zeitouna Koranic School is part of the Government's national university system. Generally, Shari'a-based interpretation of civil law is applied only in some family cases. Some families avoid the effects of Shari'a on inheritance by executing sales contracts between parents and children to ensure that sons and daughters receive equal shares of property. According to the US State Department's International Religious Freedom Report, there have been some reports as of 2004 that the married interfaith couples to register the birth of their children and receive birth certificates if the mother was Christian and the father was Muslim and the parents tried to give their children non-Muslim names. History The area that is now Tunisia came under the rule of Islam during the Umayyad Caliphate, (661‚Äì750/A.H.).Spread of Islam (Map) The Umayyads founded the first Islamic city in North Africa, Kairouan where in 670 AD that the Mosque of Uqba, or the Great Mosque of Kairouan, was constructed;. This mosque is the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the Muslim West with the oldest standing minaret in the world; it is also considered a masterpiece of Islamic art and architecture. Zitouna mosque-university, was created around 703 AD, and became the center of Tunisia's Islamic scholarship and preaching. The Muslim Arab governors of Tunis founded the Aghlabid Dynasty, which ruled Tunisia, Tripolitania and eastern Algeria from 800 to 909. Its capital Kairuan became the most important centre of learning in the Maghreb, most notably in the field of Theology and Law. =1800‚Äì2011= Ariana has contemporary architecture Tunisia was influenced more heavily by Europe during the colonial era (it was a French protectorate and in 1945 had 144,000 colonialists living in it) and is considered the most westernized of Muslim North African states. Its first president, Habib Bourguiba, was committed to secularism, and dismantled University of Ez-Zitouna, replacing it with a faculty of Shari\`a and Theology attached to the Tunis University in 1958. A Personal Status Code made law in 1956 prohibited polygamy, raised the age of marriage for girls to 17 years of age, made it easier for women to get a divorce, and banned forced marriages for minor girls. He also named a Grand Mufti of the Republic. His successor, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali (1987‚Äì2011), created a Higher Islamic Council. He required that imams of mosques be appointed by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. The ministry often appointed members of the ruling Democratic Constitutional Rally party, which also controlled the content of prayer services. A law passed in 1988 forbid all activities and meetings in mosques by people other than those appointed by the state.‚ÄúLa Tunisie veut r√©cup√©rer les mosqu√©es contr√¥l√©es par des radicaux,‚Äù Jeune Afrique, March 12, 2014. In 2004, the US State Department reported that people were sometimes interrogated just for associating or being seen in the street with practising Muslims. The government allowed the construction of mosques provided they were built in accordance with national urban planning regulations, but upon completion, they became the property of the Government. There were also frequent reports that police sometimes harassed or detained men with beards whom the Government suspected because of their \\"Islamic\\" appearance.International Religious Freedom Report 2006 US Department of State.

In March 2013, the minister of religious affairs at the time, Nourredine Khademi, called upon Tunisians to fight jihad in Syria.‚ÄúNoureddine Khademi appelait les Tunisiens au jihad en Syrie,‚Äù Business News, March 19, 2013. As of early 2015 about 3,000 Tunisians are believed to have gone to fight in Syria. Calls came for legalization of polygamy, from Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice A new mufti appointed in 2013, (Hamda Sa√Ød) was known to have supported polygamous marriage.Asma Smadhi, ‚ÄúControversial Figure Hamda Sa√Ød Appointed as Tunisia‚Äôs New Mufti,‚Äù Tunisia Live, July 8, 2013. In August 2013, the Tunisian government declared Ansar al-Shari\`a an illegal terrorist organization following its alleged involvement in the political assassinations of secularist politicians Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi in 2013. Following an Islamist attack on July 16, 2014 killing 12 army soldiers, the prime minister's office created a ‚Äúcrisis unit‚Äù to coordinate efforts to combat terrorism. Shortly thereafter, the ministry closed two religious radio stations and one television channel it accused of spreading hate speech and advocating violence, and 157 associations‚Äîmostly Islamic‚Äîbecause of alleged links with terrorism and incitement to violence. (Human Rights Watch called these suspensions disproportionate and arbitrary.) Islamist Attacks on tourists (over 60 civilians, mostly tourists, were killed in 2015 by jihadis), devastating Tunisia's tourist industry. In December 2014 the Ministry of Religious Affairs announced it had re-asserted state control over all mosques in Tunisia and in cooperation with civil society organizations, trained imams in moderate discourse when delivering sermons. But, at least as of 2014, the content of prayer services is not controlled by government authorities. In 2017 a handful of men were arrested for eating in public during Ramadan, they were convicted of committing ‚Äúa provocative act of public indecency‚Äù and sentenced to month-long jail sentences. The state in Tunisia has a role as a \\"guardian of religion\\" which was used to justify the arrests. Since 2017, Tunisian Muslim women can legally and officially marry non-Muslim men.

Jeffries. Sharkey's recorded ring career spanned from 1893 to 1904. He is credited with having won 40 fights (with 37 KOs), 7 losses, and 5 draws. Sharkey was named to the Ring Magazines list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. Career Standing or 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) tall, Sharkey was a standup brawler, who came right after his opponents. Sharkey was easy to hit, but rough and tumble and a hard puncher. He had unusually broad shoulders for a man of his height, and sported a tattoo of a star and battleship on his chest. In 1900 he also acquired a large cauliflower ear, courtesy of a brawl with Gus Ruhlin, that added to his persona. Sharkey's first bout against a front-line fighter occurred in 1896 when he fought Joe Choynski, who was later to knock out legendary heavyweight Jack Johnson, in an eight-round match. Sharkey followed that fight up by challenging \\"Gentleman Jim\\" Corbett. The two met and the fight was ruled a draw after four rounds due to police interference. =Sharkey vs. Fitzsimmons= Interior of the Mechanics Pavilion, San Francisco, in 1897. On December 2, 1896, the San Francisco Athletic Club sponsored a fight at the Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco between Bob Fitzsimmons and Sharkey. Unable to find a referee, at the last minute they called on former lawman Wyatt Earp. He had officiated 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the Marquess of Queensbury rules. The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American soil that year. It had been billed for the heavyweight championship of the world, as it was thought that the champion, James J. Corbett had relinquished the crown. Fitzsimmons was favored to win, and bets flowed heavily his way. Earp entered the ring still armed with his customary Colt .45 and drew a lot of attention when he had to be disarmed. He later said he forgot he was wearing it. Fitzsimmons was taller and quicker than Sharkey and dominated the fight from the opening bell. In the eighth round, Fitzsimmons hit Sharkey with his famed \\"solar plexus punch,\\" an uppercut under the heart that could render a man temporarily helpless. The punch caught Sharkey, Earp, and most of the crowd by surprise, and Sharkey dropped, clutched his groin, and rolled on the canvas, screamed foul. Earp stopped the bout, ruling that Fitzsimmons had hit Sharkey when he was down. His ruling was greeted with loud boos and catcalls. Earp based his decision on the Marquess of Queensbury rules, which state in part, \\"A man on one knee is considered down and if struck is entitled to the stakes.\\" Very few witnessed the foul Earp ruled on. He awarded the decision to Sharkey, whom attendants carried out as \\"...limp as a rag.\\". =Sharkey vs. Jeffries= Sharkey (left) during his fight with Jeffries Sharkey claimed the heavyweight title until Corbett resumed his fighting career, who was recognized as the champion until he was knocked out by Fitzsimmons in a title bout. Sharkey was involved in another controversial fight when he faced Corbett on November 22, 1898. In this bout Sharkey manhandled the shifty and elusive Corbett. He threw him to the ground, hit him with hard punches to the body and head and seemed on the verge of imminent victory when one of Corbett's seconds jumped into the ring in the ninth round. The referee disqualified Corbett and awarded the bout to Sharkey. On January 10, 1899, Sharkey faced another ring legend, the tricky Kid McCoy. Sharkey knocked out McCoy in the tenth round thereby securing a shot at the heavyweight title then held by James J. Jeffries. The two had met previously, fighting a hotly contested 20-round slugfest on May 6, 1898. The decision went to Jeffries in a close fight. Nevertheless, Sharkey vowed to beat the 6'2¬Ω burly Jeffries in the rematch. The two fought a memorable twenty-five round bout on November 3, 1899 in Coney Island, New York. The match was the first championship fight filmed for motion pictures, and was first indoor fight successfully filmed. The lights required for the filming were so hot that they burned the hair from the top of both fighters' heads. Sharkey took the early lead when he battered the larger Jeffries, but Jeffries gained control of the fight in the later rounds and the bout was awarded to him. During this fight, Sharkey suffered a broken nose and two broken ribs, and his left ear swelled to the size of a grapefruit.

Closure performance refers to the activities near and after mine closure and how well activities listed in the closure plan are carried out. A mine begins to close the day it opens. Decisions made during the mine planning and development phase ‚Äì and even earlier, during the exploration phase ‚Äì have profound effects on the ultimate closure plan, its cost, and the resulting landscape performance. These decisions need to be made within a framework of closure planning to realize successful land reclamation. Activities related to closure planning often include: preparation of detailed drawings of disturbed landscape, compilation of baseline information, discussions with regulators and stakeholders on end land use considerations, crafting of supporting research programs, and preparation of budgets and schedules. For a mine nearing closure, the closure plan takes the form of a decommissioning plan, and includes details and selection of mitigative technologies (especially for acid rock drainage) and other specific reclamation and closure activities. A critical element of successful reclamation and of good closure planning is stakeholder involvement. Generally, mines do a poor job of ongoing, meaningful stakeholder consultation, and many would benefit from professional assistance. A particularly useful consultation process involves forming a local committee to provide guidance to one or more mines in the region in their reclamation and closure activities with a focus on providing ongoing dialog with stakeholders and identifying the goals important to stakeholders. The most important benefit of closure planning is identification of critical activities to achieve successful reclamation. Closure planning usually identifies areas of needed research. It also identifies planning constraints (and sometimes opportunities) especially identifying safe methods and locations for tailings storage. These plans provide some assurance that the mine is not ‚Äúpainting itself into a corner‚Äù and provide a starting basis to estimate financial assurance levels ‚Äì important to both mines and regulators. It also forms a base case against which future planning changes can be compared. Much of this work falls under the concept of ‚Äúdesign for closure‚Äù introduced 30 years ago. Typical closure plans are 100 to 200 page documents that require several months to prepare and cost approximately US$200,000. They are usually developed by the supervisor of the environmental department, or by a mining, environmental, or geotechnical consultant. They are submitted at the request of the regulatory authority and are used by the mine for life of mine costing. Most closure planning documents share the same format: # Introduction # Predevelopment conditions # Mine operations explained # Landscape performance goals (and regulatory requirements) # Reclamation technologies and methods # Reclamation plans, balances, waste isolation methods # Long term monitoring and maintenance plans # Landscape performance prediction # Comparison of the performance prediction relative to the goals # Schedules and costs # Financial assurance See also *Care and maintenance References *McKenna, G.T., 2002.

Life and work Giannini began as a violinist under the tutelage of his mother Antonietta Briglia; he would go on to study violin and composition at the Milan Conservatory on scholarship, and then to take his graduate degree at the Juilliard School. He returned to Juilliard to teach, moving on to the Manhattan School of Music and the Curtis Institute of Music. His students included Herbie Hancock, Nicolas Flagello, David Amram, Mark Bucci, Alfred Reed, Anthony Iannaccone, M. William Karlins, Irwin Swack, John Corigliano, Adolphus Hailstork, Thomas Pasatieri, Avraham Sternklar, and Nancy Bloomer Deussen. Giannini was the founder and first president of the North Carolina School of the Arts in 1965, which he envisioned as a type of Juilliard of the South, bringing artists such as cellist Irving Klein and violinist Ruggiero Ricci to teach there. He remained there until his untimely death in 1966 Giannini's father, Ferruccio Giannini, was an opera singer and founder of the Verdi Opera House in Philadelphia, as were as his two sisters. Euphemia Giannini Gregory taught Voice at the Curtis Institute for 40 years counting among her students the opera divas Anna Moffo and Judith Blegen . In fact, it was his sister, Dusolina Giannini, who was a pivotal figure in the success of his operas. Dusolina was a dramatic soprano and prima donna who played such roles as Aida and Donna Anna throughout Europe, until moving to the United States to sing with the Metropolitan Opera and finally to spend her remaining years teaching. Her career was already well underway when Vittorio wished to premiere his first opera, Lucedia and it was her influence that led to its production in 1934. Four years later she would create the role of Hester Prynne in his opera from Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (adapted by Karl Flaster) . Both operas would be successful, as would most of his later operas (though two, Casanova and Christus, remain unperformed). His partnership with poet Karl Flaster was a fruitful one. In addition to his work on The Scarlet Letter, Flaster was the librettist for several of Giannini's operas, including Lucedia and The Harvest. Also, Flaster collaborated with Giannini on many of his most successful art songs, including \\"Tell Me, Oh Blue Blue Sky\\" ; many of these songs are now staples of vocal recitalists' repertoire. Though it was initially his vocal and operatic works that earned him greatest renown, Giannini also composed seven symphonies (only the last five were numbered), concerti, and chamber music. During the last eight years of his life he composed five works for wind band and, ironically, today they are his most widely performed compositions. One of them, his Symphony No. 3 (1958) has become a staple of the band repertoire. Despite the wide range of his output, little of his music is in the active repertoire. However, today a representative sample of all aspects of his work is available on recording.

It is listed as Endangered because of a serious ongoing population decline, estimated to be more than 50% over the past three generations (estimated to be 15 years), inferred from direct habitat destruction, and indirect inferred declines due to pollutants. Cynogale is a monospecific genus.  Characteristics  Gervais' Histoire naturelle des mammif√®res The otter civet possesses several adaptations to its habitat, including a broad mouth and webbed feet with naked soles and long claws. Its muzzle is long with numerous long whiskers. It is in many ways similar to the Hose's palm civet (Diplogale hosei) but has a shorter tail and no whitish underparts.  Distribution and habitat  Otter civets are distributed in Sumatra, Borneo and peninsular Thailand. Preferred habitat appears to be lowland primary forest, but they have also been recorded in secondary forest, bamboo and logged forest. The supposed origin of Lowe's otter civet (C. lowei) known only from one holotype found in 1926 in northern Vietnam was not confirmed. They are thought to be largely confined to peat swamp forests, though there are recent records from lowland dry forest. In March 2005, an otter civet was camera trapped within an acacia plantation in central Sarawak during 1,632 trap-nights. Between July 2008 and January 2009, ten otter civets were photographed in an area of about in Sabah's Deramakot Forest Reserve, a lowland tropical rainforest in Borneo ranging in altitude from . In May 2009, the presence of otter civets was documented for the first time in central Kalimantan, where two individuals were photographed in the Sabangau Peat-swamp Forest at an elevation of about .  Ecology and behaviour  The otter civet is a nocturnal species that obtains most of its food from the water, feeding on fish, crabs and freshwater mollusks. It can also climb to feed on birds and fruit. Given its rarity and secretive nature it is a very poorly known species.  Threats  Conversion of peat swamp forests to oil palm plantations is a major threat. There is no evidence that the species is specifically hunted, but as a ground-dwelling species it is exposed to snares and other ground-level traps set for other species. Clear-cut logging is one of the major factors contributing to decline in suitable habitat, and even selective logging may sufficiently alter habitat such that it is the species can no longer occupy it; combined, this loss of primary forest may be responsible for the current rarity of the otter civet.  Conservation  Cynogale bennettii is listed in CITES Appendix II. References * Kanchanasakha, B. (1998). Carnivores of Mainland South East Asia. WWF, Bangkok.

The book takes its name from an included short story of the same title, which in turn took the title from a poem by Walt Whitman published in his collection Leaves of Grass. Contents The collection includes these stories: ; \\"The Kilimanjaro Device\\" (originally titled \\"The Kilimanjaro Machine\\", first appeared in Life Magazine, January 1965): After a long drive, a man arrives in Idaho and begins to ask questions about a local who has died. In a bar, he finally finds someone who was familiar with the person he is looking for. Though the latter is never referred to by name, it becomes clear that he is none other than Ernest Hemingway. When asked why he's looking for him, the traveler reveals that his truck has the ability to travel in time. He goes further to explain that there are right graves and wrong graves; that people do not always die at the right time, and this local man is one of them. The traveler then departs to search for Hemingway, hoping to help him find a better end. ; \\"The Terrible Conflagration Up at the Place\\": A band of rebels plot to overthrow the local lordship and express their own freedom by burning down his stately home. Before they can get on with it, the lordship himself catches them in the act and invites them inside. Offering drinks, he resigns himself to let them burn his house, though bargains with them to do it the following night, so that he and his wife may still attend the theatre. The rebels ultimately agree that it is the only decent thing to do. However, before they leave the house, the lordship asks that they also spare the priceless works of art resting in the house. Before long, the complications of burning the house become too much, and the Lordship too friendly, leaving the rebel plans long forgotten. ; \\"Tomorrow's Child\\": Peter and Polly are excited about the birth of their first child, but the doctor has unfortunate news. Because of a series of malfunctions in the new birthing machines, their newborn child has been born into another dimension.

Peter and Polly decide to take the baby home on the condition that the doctors continue ongoing work and research to try to bring their child back into his rightful dimension. Time passes, with both Peter and Polly dealing with the burden of raising their abnormal child; Polly takes it especially hard and begins drinking heavily. After almost exactly a year, the doctors give them a difficult choice. Their attempts to retrieve the baby have proved futile, but they can send Peter and Polly to the same dimension, where they would be reunited with their child, but their altered appearance would force them into solitude from the rest of society. ; \\"The Women\\" (originally published in Famous Fantastic Mysteries, October 1948): A man and his wife are at the beach, but something sinister has awakened in the water. Calling out for the man to step in the ocean, the water entity attempts to draw him to the depths. Increasingly aware of the danger, his wife does all she can to distract him from the call of the ocean. Time ticks by, the intelligence in the water growing desperate, knowing that if it cannot lure the man before he leaves today, it will be over. Storm clouds roll in, and wife believes she has won; her husband does not understand why she seems to be cheerful that their last day at the beach has been ruined. As they begin to walk away, the husband suddenly hears a drowning voice call out for help, and rushes into the water to save it. The entity envelops the man, and hours later releases his body to wash up on shore. ; \\"The Inspired Chicken Motel\\": The narrator recalls the time he spent traveling with his family during the Great Depression. In particular, he looks back fondly on a motel where the owner was the proud owner of a chicken with the ability to tell fortunes. When the family arrives, the owner presents them with two eggs, laid only days before their arrival. On one is the raised image of a longhorn steer, and the other contains the message ‚ÄúRest in peace.

Bayes confronts the killer, Mr. Booth, a self-pitying man who takes pleasure in doing harm. Bayes interrogates him, finding Mr. Booth killed Lincoln to gain attention and pleasure. Bayes then takes that away from the killer, ensuring that he will gain no attention for the murder. The killer fights back, but Bayes intimidates him, to the point where he threatens him with death should he ever talk about the murder. Mr. Booth flees from the theater, while Bayes reflects on himself over letting the killer go. ; \\"Yes, We'll Gather at the River\\": A small town is confronted with the reality of a new roadway being built. The new road bypasses the town completely, and threatens the livelihood of all the town's businesses. The store owners reflect on how things have changed; roads used to take years to build, but now take only a matter of hours. They each know that even though they will move onward, a part of them will die with the town; they ultimately accept this without ill feeling, seeing the inevitably changing course of the road like that of a flowing river. ; \\"The Cold Wind and the Warm\\" (originally published in Harper's Magazine, July 1964): In Dublin, Ireland, David and his team of strange travelers arrive at the Royal Hibernian Hotel, with the intention of \\"doing something mysterious\\".

They report their findings back at the tavern, only to have David walk into the tavern himself. He tells the story of two races travelling to the other's countries, to escape the heat or cold, and reveals that he himself was trying to escape the heat of the equatorial countries and visit a colder country like Ireland. The townspeople watch the leaves change colors as David and his team travel back to their countries. ; \\"Night Call, Collect\\": A man stranded on Mars sits in an empty town, in an empty house.

His youthful self sits out of the reach of time, mocking him as he grows only older. Maddened, he sets off across the planet, attempting to destroy every vestige of his own voice. On his way, he gets a call from a passing ship; is he finally rescued, or is it simply another trick played on him by his own voice? ; \\"The Haunting of the New\\": Nora, a rich owner of an illustrious house, invites Charlie to investigate her house after it seemingly causes her previous party to die down and end quickly. As Charlie drives to her house, he reminisces of the time he and Nora had spent together, and when he investigates the house, he finds a few good memories from his past. Nora then reveals that the real house had burnt down 4 years ago, but she had recreated it down to the finest details with the help of numerous artisans.

Thrilled at the idea, Tom, Timothy and Agatha go with their father to the Fantoccini company showroom in order to custom build their new grandmother. The children take turns selecting her parts, the color of her eyes, even the tone of her voice. Weeks later, a mysterious package arrives, a sarcophagus containing their factory-fresh electric grandmother. At the turn of a key, she springs to life and quickly becomes an essential part of the family. Tom, Timothy and their father immediately begin to love her, but Agatha remains distant, untrusting. It slowly becomes clear that Agatha does not believe that the grandmother will always be there for them; she is afraid that she will leave them, just as their mother did when she died. One day, Agatha runs from the house in tears straight into traffic. In a flash, the grandmother pushes her to safety, only to be hit by the car herself. Agatha cries, but finds herself comforted by the grandmother, who is unscathed by the accident. The grandmother insists that she will never leave her and that not even death could separate them.

The forms of the Long Fist style emphasize fully extended kicks and striking techniques, and by appearance would be considered a long-range fighting system. In some Long Fist styles the motto is that \\"the best defense is a strong offense,\\" in which case the practitioner launches a preemptive attack so aggressive that the opponent doesn't have the opportunity to attack. Others emphasize defense over offense, noting that nearly all techniques in Long Fist forms are counters to attacks. Long Fist uses large, extended, circular movements to improve overall body mobility in the muscles, tendons, and joints. Advanced Long Fist techniques include qin na joint-locking techniques and shuai jiao throws and takedowns. The Long Fist style is considered to contain a good balance of hand and foot techniques, but in particular it is renowned for its impressive acrobatic kicks. In demonstration events, Long Fist techniques are most popular and memorable for their whirling, running, leaping, and acrobatics. Contemporary changquan moves are difficult to perform, requiring great flexibility and athleticism comparable to that of gymnastics. Long Fist's arsenal of kicks covers everything from a basic front snap-kick to a jumping back-kick, from a low sweep to a whirlwind-kick. Specifically, typical difficulty movements in modern Changquan include: xuanfengjiao (ÊóãÈ£éËÑö; \\"whirlwind kick\\"), xuanzi (ÊóãÂ≠ê; \\"butterfly jump\\"), cekongfan (‰æßÁ©∫Áøª; \\"side somersault\\"), and tengkongfeijiao (ËÖæÁ©∫È£ûËÑö; \\"flying jump kick\\"). History of Long Fist The core of Changquan/Long Fist was developed in the 10th century by Zhao Kuangyin, founding Emperor of the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279). His style was called T√†iz«î Ch√°ngqu√°n, which means \\"the Long Fist style of Emperor Taizu.\\" In semi- legendary \\"classic\\" writings transmitted by Taijiquan's Yang family, their martial art is referred to by the name Ch√°ngqu√°n in one of the received texts. These texts can only be reliably dated to the second half of the 19th century. The Long Fist of contemporary w«îsh√π draws on ChƒÅqu√°n, \\"flower fist\\" HuƒÅqu√°n, P√†o Chu√≠, and \\"red fist\\" (H√≥ngqu√°n). Widely perceived to have a strong Shaolin influence, traditional Long Fist was promoted at the Nanjing Guoshu Institute by Han Qing-Tang (ÈüìÊÖ∂Â†Ç), a famous Long Fist and qin na expert. After the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek and subsequent closing of the institute, the new People's Republic of China created contemporary wushu, a popular artistic sport inspired largely by traditional Long Fist. However, this new evolution of changquan differed from the old style in that it was exhibition-focused. Higher, more elaborate jump kicks and lower stances were adopted, in order to create more aesthetically pleasing forms. Applications were then reserved for the sport of sanshou, which was kept somewhat separate from the taolu (forms). In 2005 with the creation of difficulty movements criteria in international competition, there has been a continued attention to jumps. Subtypes of Long Fist * P√†o Chu√≠ (Chinese: ÁÇÆÊç∂; literally \\"cannon punch\\") pre-Tang Dynasty; * ChƒÅqu√°n (Chinese: Êü•Êã≥; Cha Yuanyi style) Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907); * T√†iz«î Ch√°ngqu√°n (Chinese: Â§™Á•ñÈï∑Êã≥; \\"Emperor Taizu (Great Ancestor) long fist\\") Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279); * FƒÅnziqu√°n (Chinese: ÁøªÂ≠êÊã≥; \\"tumbling fist\\") Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279); * H√≥ngqu√°n (Chinese: Á¥ÖÊã≥; \\"red fist\\") Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279); and * Hu√°qu√°n (Chinese: ËèØÊã≥; \\"China fist\\") Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907).

Some models focus on long-term (natural or geological) erosion, as a component of landscape evolution. However, many erosion models were developed to quantify the effects of accelerated soil erosion i.e. soil erosion as influenced by human activity. Most soil erosion models consider only soil erosion by water, however a few aim to predict wind erosion. Models which consider tillage erosion are rare. Also soil erosion models have been more commonly developed for use on agricultural landscapes, rather than on naturally vegetated areas (such as rangeland or forests). A few erosion models focus on erosion on mined areas. The aim of the majority of soil erosion models is to predict average rates (often an annual average rate) of soil loss from an area such as a plot, a field or a catchment/watershed under various land management techniques. Some erosion models are purely statistical, others more mechanistic (or physically based). Two of the more widely used soil erosion models in North America are the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Water Erosion Prediction Project erosion model (WEPP). Much of the mineland erosion literature is solely focused on fitting or improving RUSLE parameters. Few soil erosion models consider gully erosion, mostly due to difficulties in modelling these large erosional features. Several studies have evaluated the ability of soil erosion models to realistically predict measured rates of erosion, mainly on agricultural landscapes. There is often a wide discrepancy between predicted and observed erosion rates. Thus soil erosion models are still better as research tools than as public policy and regulatory instruments or for prescriptive design measures for constructed landforms. However soil erosion models may provide useful guidance for the design engineer if adequately calibrated and verified for local conditions and if the design accounts for the uncertainty. Most erosion modelling is applied to existing sites of known topography and material properties to guide land management activities. Designers of constructed landforms, however, have considerable control over the topography, cover soil placement, initial revegetation, and to a lesser extent the substrate properties ‚Äì flexibility that is generally uneconomical for farmers and ranchers and most users of erosion models. On the other hand, miners have little input into post-closure land use practices and management. Methods to estimate erosion rates include: * purely statistical models * subjectively determined erosion rates using expert judgement combined with a database of erosion rates of natural and reclaimed sites (natural and industrial analogs) * surveying of existing erosional or depositional features of known age (or as determined by dating of deposits) to determine average erosion rates. Analysis of historical aerial photographs is often employed. * site-specific empirical models that relate slope, watershed size, and rainfall * empirical and semi-empirical or deterministic models based on laboratory and field flume measurements of erosion under simulated rainfall or flow conditions * physically based gully erosion models * landform and landscape scale models, often GIS-based, that apply erosion mechanics or statistical relationships to predict changes in topography and erosion rates * sediment-budget models based on watershed monitoring.

They can be as small as a tennis ball, but they can also be bigger than a car. Most snow rollers are a few inches or centimeters wide. Alternative names for snow rollers include: snow bales, snow donuts, snownuts and wind snowballs. Unlike snowballs made by people, snow rollers are typically cylindrical in shape, and are often hollow since the inner layers, which are the first layers to form, are weak and thin compared to the outer layers. The inner sections can easily be blown away, leaving what looks like a doughnut or Swiss roll. Several conditions are needed for snow rollers to form: * There must be a relatively thin surface layer of wet, loose snow, with a temperature near the melting point of ice. * Under this thin layer of wet snow there must be a substrate to which the thin surface layer of wet snow will not stick, such as ice or powder snow. * The wind must be strong enough to move the snow rollers, but not strong enough to blow them apart. * Alternatively, gravity can move the snow rollers as when a snowball, such as those that will fall from a tree or cliff, lands on a steep hill and begins to roll down the hill. Because of this last condition, snow rollers are more common in hilly areas. However, the precise nature of the conditions required makes them a very rare phenomenon.

While various Church bodies have widely varying practices and teachings, individual Christians of every major tradition are involved in practical (orthopraxy) discussions about how to respond to the issue. Terminology Blessing of a same-sex union *Same-sex union *Same-sex marriage Theological views of those who support same-sex unions and/or marriages Those Christians and churches which support blessing of same-sex unions do so from several perspectives: * It is an affirmative good that stands alongside straight marriage and committed monastic celibacy as a revelation of God's self in the world.Institute for Progressive Christianity (instituteforprogressivechristianity.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=37&Itemid;=36) link inactive as of 2008-05-10 * The logical coherence of the core Christian doctrines such as the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Resurrection and the Ascension is improved through the integration of gay marriage into the Christian conception of marriage. * Our understanding of marriage as a metaphor of Christ‚Äôs relationship with the Church is strengthened by assimilating gay marriage into that metaphor. * Some scholars maintain that scripture in the original languages contains no prohibition of homosexuality, but does record same-sex marriage.Hope Remains \\"But if we take a closer look, reading the scripture in the original Hebrew and Greek, we discover that God never condemned homosexuality, and that same-sex marriage existed in Bible times.\\" Gay and Christian? Yes!, pp. 1‚Äì70, Rev. William H. Carey, 2006, 2008 Lulu.com \\"To tell a homosexual that the Bible is Good News, (but that) it says that their ability to love on a one-to-one basis (mate level) means they are sinful and perverted in God's eyes is a gross contradiction in terms. What's more, God is not saying this to gay people. God's Word is this: For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16, KJV). And that is the Good News for modern gays.\\" Good News for Modern Gays, pp. 1‚Äì213, Rev. Sylvia Pennington, 1985 Lambda Lite Productions * The biblic references to homosexuality were uttered in the context of promiscuous same-sex practices of Hellenistic cultures (Paul) and cultures surrounding the people of Israel (Deut). This kind of sex without love was often practiced in lieu of going to female prostitutes, also by heterosexual men. It is a discriminating misconception of our times to transfer that prohibition of such promiscuous practice without love to what we discuss here: durable, long term, choosy same-sex unions.Streitfall Liebe - Biblische Pl√§doyers wider die Ausgrenzung homosexuelller Menschen, Valeria Hinck, Mering : Pro-Literatur-Verlag 2007 http://d-nb.info/984453415 Churches favorable to same-sex union and/or same- sex marriage =Episcopalian polities= Anglicanism In 2004, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, asked the Lambeth Commission on Communion to produce a report looking into the legal and theological implications flowing from decisions related to homosexuality that were apparently threatening the Anglican Communion, including decisions relating to the blessing of same-sex unions. Once published the Windsor Report led to the calling by the Lambeth Commission for a moratorium on the blessing of same-sex unions, and recommended that bishops who have authorised such rites in the United States and Canada \\"be invited to express regret that the proper constraints of the bonds of affection were breached by such authorisation.\\" The report was roundly condemned by supporters of the gay and lesbian community, as well as by a number of theologians for its partiality.The Windsor Report was the subject of a special issue of the Anglican Theological Review (Volume 87, no. 4, 2005), which contained sharp criticism, historical analysis, and more appreciative articles from a broad spectrum of theologians. To date, \\"the more liberal provinces that are open to changing Church doctrine on marriage in order to allow same-sex unions include Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Scotland, South India, South Africa, the US and Wales\\". =Anglican Church of Canada= The General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada in 2004 voted to defer a decision of same-sex blessings until 2007, but also to \\"Affirm the integrity and sanctity of committed adult same-sex relationships\\". In 2007, a resolution enabling diocesan bishops to authorize the blessing of same-gender unions narrowly failed, but a statement adopted by General Synod in 2010 \\"acknowledge[d] diverse pastoral practices as dioceses respond to their own missional contexts,\\" effectively devolving decisions about blessings to local dioceses. The Anglican Church of Canada does not distinguish theologically between a marriage solemnized in church and a civil marriage subsequently blessed by a priest. Currently, three dioceses ‚Äì New Westminster, Niagara, and Montr√©al ‚Äì extend the blessing of civil marriages to same-sex couples. Procedures for blessings are in development in Ottawa and Toronto. In 2010 the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada voted to study a proposal to bless only those marriages that have been civilly registered, even where marriage is reserved to heterosexual couples, abrogating the role of clergy as delegates of the provincial registrar altogether. The blessing of same-sex unions became a subject of media attention in the Vancouver area in May, 2003 when Bishop Michael Ingham of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster announced that he had given priests in some parishes the authority to bless gay and lesbian unions. Bishop Ingham issued a rite of blessing of people in committed same-sex unions on May 23, 2003. This was done in response to requests by three consecutive Diocesan Synods, culminating in June, 2002. The diocese considers that the blessing of same-sex couples is one part of their work of community outreach and care for parishioners. The blessing is a way that some priests use to ensure that homosexual people who seek to be included in the Anglican Communion feel safe and respected. The blessing is a ‚Äúpastoral tool‚Äù. Some priests in some parishes (six out of 80) bless permanent faithful relationships. Permission is granted by the bishop only when a priest requests it, and a parish has decided by majority vote, that they want to be a place of blessing. Ingham says of the practice: I insist only that those on all sides of the issue respect one another and that everyone should maintain the order of the church. Our goal in the Anglican Church in the Greater Vancouver area is to be a church that accommodates differences. In 2009, the Anglican Diocese of Niagara in southwestern Ontario became the second diocese to authorize the blessing of same-sex unions when Bishop Michael Bird approved a gender-neutral rite for the blessing of civil marriages. The rite will be permitted for use in consultation with the diocesan bishop beginning September 1, 2009. In 2009, the Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa authorized the blessing of same-sex unions in a single parish: the Church of St John the Evangelist. Rather than issuing a specific rite, Bishop Chapman authorized an existing rite already in use for the blessing of civil marriages between opposite-sex couples. In 2010, the Rt Rev'd Barry Clarke, Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Montreal, authorized the blessing of same-sex unions. He issued a rite and guidelines to permit the blessing of civil marriages regardless of the gender of the spouses. The rite had been adapted from an existing rite already in use for the blessing of civil marriages between opposite-sex couples. A limited number of parishes in the Anglican Diocese of Toronto have been authorized to bless same-sex unions. Rather than crafting a specific rite of blessing, the Archbishop of Toronto issued guidelines setting rules and restrictions on blessings. Blessings must not resemble too closely a marriage rite, with the specific proviso that no form of blessing used for marriage in the official rites of the Anglican Church of Canada or other parts of the Anglican Communion may be used with same-sex couples. On July 12, 2016 the General Synod voted in favour of same-sex marriage.CBC:Anglicans to allow same-sex marriage after vote recount The Dioceses of Ottawa and Niagara, which already provide blessing rites, have announced that they will begin allowing same-sex marriages. =Episcopal Church in the USA= At its triennial General Convention in 1976, the Episcopal Church took its first official step toward the ‚Äúmarriage equality‚Äù it established thirty-nine years later in its 2015 General Convention as recounted below.Episcopal News Service staff, ‚ÄúGeneral Convention wrap-up: Historic actions, structural changes‚Äù (July 7, 2015). Online at http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2015/07/07/general- convention-wrap-up-historic-actions-structural-changes/ . 1976\\\\. The 1976 General Convention resolved ‚Äúthat it is the sense of this General Convention that homosexual persons are children of God who have a full and equal claim with all other persons upon the love, acceptance, and pastoral concern and care of the Church.‚ÄùJournal of the General Convention of The Episcopal Church, Minneapolis 1976 (New York: General Convention, 1977), C-109. Online at http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi- bin/acts/acts_resolution.pl?resolution=1976-A069. 2006\\\\. At its 2006 General Convention, the Episcopal Church rejected a resolution allowing the solemnization of same-sex marriages in Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage is recognized by civil law. However, the 2006 General Convention adopted a resolution under the title ‚ÄúReaffirm Church Membership of Gay and Lesbian Persons.‚Äù The resolution was in four parts:Journal of the General Convention of The Episcopal Church, Columbus, 2006 (New York: General Convention, 2007), 669-670. * It reaffirmed ‚Äúthat gay and lesbian persons are by Baptism full members of the Body of Christ and of The Episcopal Church as ‚Äòchildren of God who have a full and equal claim with all other persons upon the love, acceptance, and pastoral concern and care of the Church.‚Äô ‚Äù * It apologized ‚Äúon behalf of The Episcopal Church to its members who are gay or lesbian, and to lesbians and gay men outside the Church, for years of rejection and maltreatment by the Church,‚Äù and recommit to ‚Äúseek amendment of our life together as we ask God‚Äôs help in sharing the Good News with all people.‚Äù * It pledged ‚Äúto include openly gay and lesbian persons on every committee, commission or task force developed for the specific purpose of discussing issues about sexuality and request the same of our sister churches in the Anglican Communion and Anglican Communion bodies.‚Äù * Regarding membership in the Anglican Communion, it reiterated that ‚Äúour baptism into Jesus Christ is inseparable from our communion with one another, and we commit ourselves to that communion despite our diversity of opinion and, among dioceses, a diversity of pastoral practice with the gay men and lesbians among us.‚ÄùJournal of the General Convention of The Episcopal Church, Columbus, 2006 (New York: General Convention, 2007), 669-670. 2009\\\\. In July 2009, the General Convention adopted a resolution allowing individual bishops to choose whether or not to allow the blessing of same-sex unions within their dioceses. The resolution was seen as a compromise between those who call for an official rite for the blessing of same-sex unions, and those who oppose any recognition of such unions. However, the resolution also left the door open for the creation of such an official rite in the future, calling on bishops to \\"collect and develop theological and liturgical resources\\" for possible use for such a purpose at the 2012 General Convention. 2012\\\\. On July 9, 2012, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution approving an official liturgy for blessing same-sex unions. This liturgy, called ‚ÄúThe Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant‚Äù offers a blessing close to marriage, but the church is clear that it is not marriage. According to Rev. Ruth Meyers, chairwoman of the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music, ‚ÄúThere are a lot of similarities. The couple give their consent to being joined in lifelong commitment, they exchange vows. There‚Äôs the possibility of exchanging rings, or, for couples who have been together for some time and already have rings, to have their rings blessed. There is a blessing over the couple. But we‚Äôre clear at this point that this is not a marriage because the Episcopal Church is not in agreement in its understanding of marriage.‚Äù The resolution enables priests to bestow the church‚Äôs blessing on gay couples even if they live in a state where same-sex marriage is illegal; however, bishops who do not approve of the liturgy can prohibit their priests from using it. The resolution is provisional and will be reviewed in three years. As of September 1, 2012, clergy of the Episcopal Diocese of New York have been authorized to officiate at same sex weddings. 2015\\\\. As the Episcopal News Service reported on the 2015 Seventy-eighth General Convention, ‚Äúin the wake of the June 26 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage for all Americans, General Convention followed suit on July 1 with canonical and liturgical changes to provide marriage equality for Episcopalians.‚Äù A canonical change eliminated ‚Äúlanguage defining marriage as between a man and a woman‚Äù and ‚Äútwo new marriage rites with language allowing them to be used by same-sex or opposite- sex couples.‚Äù These new marriage rites are to be used ‚Äúunder the discretion and with the permission of the diocesan bishop.‚Äù Also, ‚Äúclergy retain the canonical right to refuse to officiate at any wedding.‚Äù The two new marriage rites have been made available online without charge by the Church Publishing House. ‚ÄúThe Witnessing and Blessing of a Marriage‚Äù (Church Publishing House, 2015) and ‚ÄúThe Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage 2\\" (Church Publishing House, 2015) The General Convention also approved The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant: Liturgical Resources for Blessing Same-Sex Relationships for ‚Äúcontinued use.‚ÄùSharon Sheridan, ‚ÄúGeneral Convention approves marriage equality‚Äù (Episcopal News Service, July 1, 2015). Online at http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2015/07/01/general-convention-approves- marriage-equality/. =England= In 2013, Church of England indicated that it plans the blessing of same-sex unions.Advocate.com:Church England plans blessing gay couples Presently, \\"the Church of England does not conduct Civil Partnership Ceremonies or Same Sex Marriages but individual churches can conduct a service of thanksgiving after a ceremony.\\" It is, however, forbidden by law to conduct same-sex marriages within its churches. The \\"church allows same-sex couples to have special prayers after their wedding\\", but does not allow gay priests to marry. Since special prayers are allowed, congregations have published and offered \\"Prayers for a Same Sex Commitment\\" or \\"services of thanksgiving\\" for same-sex couples. For gay clergy, the church does allow civil partnerships. The church has stated, officially, that \\"The Church of England recognises that same-sex relationships often embody fidelity and mutuality ... Civil partnerships enable these Christian virtues to be recognised socially and legally in a proper framework.\\" While not officially allowed, some gay priests have converted their civil partnerships into legal marriages and have kept their positions. In 2016, the Archbishop's Council confirmed the following: * clergy in the Church of England are allowed to enter in same-gender civil partnerships; * clergy are able to offer prayers in support of same-gender couples; * churches are able to publicly welcome LGBT people; * clergy and lay people are allowed to make arguments in favour of changing church doctrine. In 2017, the Church of England's Diocese of Hereford voted in favor of a motion calling on the church \\"to create a set of formal services and prayers to bless those who have had a same-sex marriage or civil partnership.\\" The General Synod is set to discuss the issue. At General Synod in 2019, the Church of England announced that same-gender couples may remain and be recognized as married after a spouse has experienced gender transition provided that the spouses identified as opposite genders at the time of the marriage. = Ireland = The Church of Ireland has facilitated a number of conversations about the subject of homosexuality. In 2002, a vicar celebrated a blessing service for a same-sex couple. In 2008, \\"the Church of Ireland Pensions Board ha[d] confirmed that it will treat civil partners the same as spouses.\\" In 2011, a senior minister within the church entered into a same-sex civil partnership becoming the first to do so. The Clergy Pension Fund recognized that \\"the pension entitlement of a member‚Äôs registered civil partner will be the same as that of a surviving spouse...\\" A Church of Ireland report states that \\"the moral logic underpinning the negative portrayal of same-sex eroticism in Scripture does not directly address committed, loving, consecrated same-sex relationships today\\". Currently, the church recognizes four main viewpoints ranging from opposition of same-sex unions to full acceptance of same-sex marriage. =Scotland= In 2015, the General Synod of the Scottish Episcopal Church passed an initial vote which could eventually lead to the formal blessing of same-sex unions.Scottish Episcopal Church passes initial vote in favour of same-sex marriage Following that vote, St. Paul's Cathedral in Dundee held a special ceremony which, for the first time, blessed the union of a same-sex couple who had already been married in Dundee's registry office. In 2016, the church general synod voted to amend the marriage canon to include same-sex couples, and on 8 June 2017 it voted to allow same-sex weddings in Scottish Episcopal churches. The congregation of St Mary's Cathedral, Glasgow, had been active in supporting the change, and 20 July 2017 it was announced that a same-sex wedding was to be held in the cathedral later in the summer, making it the first in the Anglican Communion to hold a same-sex marriage. On 1 August 2017, an American couple with Scottish connections were married, in \\"a small intimate occasion\\" which included the Eucharist as a nuptial mass, at the Church of St John the Evangelist, Edinburgh. = Wales = Civil partnerships have been permitted for clergy since 2005. Regarding such civil unions, ‚ÄúThe Church in Wales has no formal view on whether people in civil partnerships who are in a sexual relationship can serve as clergy. If the issue arises, it is up to the relevant Bishop to decide.‚Äù The Welsh Church does not require abstinence within civil unions. In 2015, the Church in Wales discussed same-sex marriages and \\"more than half of its Governing Body voted in favour of [same-sex marriage]\\". However, due to the need for a 2/3 majority to amend the marriage canon, the Bench of Bishops decided to approve \\"a series of prayers which may be said with a couple following the celebration of a civil partnership or civil marriage\\". The prayers, in Form One, give thanks \\"for [the partners] who have found such love and companionship in each other, that it has led them to dedicate their lives in support of one another.\\" = Australia = For some years, the Anglican Church of Australia has debated the blessing of same- sex marriages.ABC.net: Anglicans in Perth vote to recognise same-sex marriages ABC.net: Bishop of Wangaratta supports same-sex marriages Currently, the church has no official position on homosexuality. However, due to the church's position on marriage, the Primate and Archbishop of Melbourne, Philip Freier, stated in an ad clerum that clergy cannot perform a same-sex marriage and that \\"clergy are required to ask their episcopate bishop for guidance as to how to act in specific pastoral circumstances concerning same-sex weddings and celebrations\\". The Diocese of Wangaratta has voted to bless same-sex civil unions. In 2013, the Diocese of Perth voted in favour of recognising same-sex relationships. The Diocese of Gippsland has appointed an openly gay priest to serve within its parishes. St. Andrew's Church in Subiaco, Perth has blessed a same-sex union. In 2018, Peter McLeod-Miller, an archdeacon, \\"conducted an unofficial hand-clasping ceremony at [a same-sex wedding].\\" = Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia = In 2014, the general synod of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia passed a resolution that will create a pathway towards the blessing of same-sex relationships.ThinkingAnglicans:New Zealand synod acts on same-gender blessings In the meantime, while blessing rites are being developed, \\"clergy should be permitted 'to recognise in public worship' a same-gender civil union or state marriage of members of their faith community.\\" In the Auckland Diocese, there are congregations that may offer a \\"relationship blessing\\" for two partners. In 2005, a same-sex couple was joined in a civil union at St. Matthew in the City in the Auckland diocese. The Dunedin diocese also provides a blessing for the relationship of \\"two people\\" irrespective of gender. In the Waiapu Diocese the bishop's chaplain has also performed a blessing for a same- sex couple. In May 2018 the general synod of the Anglican Church allowed blessing of same-sex marriages.NewsHub.com: Anglican Church will bless same- sex relationships = Anglican Church of Southern Africa = Some churches in Africa, \\"where homosexuals can be legally ordained\\", \\"are joining the trend, including the Anglican church in South Africa formerly led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu\\". The denomination also has no official position on homosexuality. At the same time, in 2016, \\"Anglican bishops from across southern Africa have resolved that gay and lesbian partners who enter same-sex civil unions under South African law should be welcomed into congregations as full members of the church\\". In 2016, the Diocese of Saldanha Bay proposed a motion for the \\"blessing of same-sex civil unions...\\" While the 2016 motion did not pass, the Diocese of Cape Town tabled a motion urging the bishops \\"to finalise guidelines on how its leaders should respond to same-sex partnerships of a 'faithful commitment,'...\\" Archbishop Thabo Makgoba set up, in 2017, a working committee ‚Äú‚Ä¶ to amend Canon 34 which will enable ministry to those in Same Sex Unions and the LGBTI Community in the context in which ACSA operates in Southern Africa.\\" Priests in Saldanha Bay have stated that they will unofficially bless same-sex unions. The Diocese of Pretoria joined Saldanha Bay in supporting same-sex relationships. Much earlier, in 2009, the Cape Town synod voted to \\"provide pastoral care to gay and lesbian members in 'faithful, committed' same-sex partnerships.\\" = Episcopal Anglican Church of Brazil = The Episcopal Anglican Church of Brazil permits the ordination of gay and lesbian priests and the blessing of same-sex relationships. In 2016, an Extraordinary Synod drafted a proposal for the General Synod of 2017 to amend the marriage canon to include same-sex marriage. On 1 June 2018 the General Synod voted to change the marriage canon to allow same-sex couples to get married. Old Catholic, Reformed Catholic Churches and Liberal Catholic Church Four churches of the Union of Utrecht, which shares full communion with the Anglican Churches through the Bonn Agreement, also permit such blessings: namely, Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands (the mother church) permits blessings of gay civil marriages, and the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland,Christkatholiken: Segnung f√ºr homosexuelle Paare (German) Luzerner Zeitung.de: Christkatholische Kirche will gleichgeschlechtliche Paare vor dem Altar trauen (german), August 2020 and Catholic Diocese of the Old Catholics in Germany permit blessings of homosexual civil unions. The Old Catholic Church of Austria also permits such blessings. Because of this (as well as the ordination of women), the Polish National Catholic Church (USA) seceded from the Union in 2004. Many smaller denominations, such as the Eucharistic Catholic Church, the Old Catholic Church (in Sweden) and TOCCUSA also solemnize same-sex marriages. Argentina The Danish Church in Buenos Aires performs marriages between same-sex couples. In late 2006, the tabernacle performed the first religious wedding between a lesbian couple in Latin America.

The Lutheran Church‚ÄìCanada does not permit the blessing of same-sex unions. The LC-C stance is consonant with that of its American sister church, the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod. The governing council of The United Church of Canada welcomes same-sex marriage, but individual United Church congregations are responsible for making decisions locally. Marriages are performed with the permission and under the responsibility of the local congregation. Denmark In November 2011, the Government of Denmark announced that there will be same-sex religious marriage available in the Church of Denmark as part of the broader legislative move to recognise same sex marriageCopenhagen Post, 23 November 2011: A similar debate is currently underway in the Church of Iceland following legislation to permit same sex marriage in Iceland. The Church of Denmark (in full communion with the Anglican Churches of the British Isles through the Porvoo Communion) now performs blessings of same-sex couples.queer:Homoehen in schwedischen Kirchen (German)  Finland  The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland approved special prayers for same-sex couples following a civil union or marriage. The archbishop, who supported the prayers, \\"called for the church to take a clear and unequivocal stance in support of gay and lesbian couples\\". Some bishops are willing to ordain gay and lesbian pastors. Marriage is by church law still defined as a union between one man and one woman, changing the law would require a 3/4 majority vote among church council voters.

Studies and dialogue had been under way during the past decade and continued until the 2009 Churchwide Assembly, during which the ELCA passed a resolution by a vote of 619‚Äì402 reading ‚ÄúResolved, that the ELCA commit itself to finding ways to allow congregations that choose to do so to recognize, support and hold publicly accountable lifelong, monogamous, same-gender relationships.‚ÄùBrief Summary of Actions, Eleventh ELCA Churchwide Assembly That Assembly also affirmed that sexual orientation, in itself, is not to be a qualification or exclusion for ordained ministry.ELCA:Faithfuljourney As marriage policy is a congregation matter in the ELCA, same-sex partnership blessings and marriages had been performed by many Lutheran pastors prior to the 2009 actions. In 1993 the ELCA Conference of Bishops stated it did not approve of such ceremonies, but made no comment about same-sex marriage. (The Conference of Bishops is an advisory body of the ELCA.)Later ELCA Assemblies Address Hunger, Stewardship, Sexuality Lutheran congregations which so choose may register their public affirmation for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people may register with Lutherans Concerned/North America, a church advocacy group, as \\"Reconciling in Christ.\\"LC/NA: Reconciling in Christ Participants This registry includes not only congregations, but synods, organizations, Lutheran colleges, campus ministries, social ministry institutions, Lutheran health care organizations, campus ministries, church colleges, regional synods and districts, and other groups which openly welcome gays and lesbians in their communities. The national Lutheran organization which advocates for equality for gays and lesbians inside and outside the church is known as \\"Lutherans concerned North America\\".Lutherans Concerned/North America Founded in 1974 Local chapters are found throughout the USA and Canada. In 2015, after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationally in the US, the office of the presiding bishop released a letter informing members that each congregation is free to marry gay and lesbian couples or to choose not to do so. The Old Catholic Church, Province of the United States (TOCCUSA) is a Catholic denomination founded on the ecclesiology of the Old Catholics of the Union of Utrecht. Old Catholics are progressive when it comes to social issues, yet maintain the rich tradition of the sacramental nature of the Catholic Church. All seven sacraments of the Church are open to any baptized Catholic Christian. For TOCCUSA, the sacramental nature of same sex marriages is recognized, thus ensuring that there is no distinction between the marriages of two persons of the same gender or two persons of opposite genders. Couples wishing to marry must undergo some pre-marital counseling before the marriage rite takes place. =Presbyterian polities= Church of Scotland The 2006 General Assembly of the Church of Scotland voted that blessing civil partnerships should be a matter of conscience for individual ministers. Conservatives in the Kirk argued that the reform would have to be ratified by local presbyteries. When the 45 Presbyteries were consulted, only nine voted in favour of allowing ministers to bless civil-partnered (same-sex) couples, and the remaining 36 were against the innovation. Therefore, it was defeated, and is due to be addressed again at the 2013 General Assembly. At its 2011 General Assembly, the Church of Scotland voted to allow openly gay and lesbian Ministers and Diaconal ministers who live in civil unions, provided that they were already ordained and had declared their sexuality before the Scott Rennie case on 23 May 2009. There remains, however, a Moratorium on accepting those in same-sex relationships for training, ordination or induction into the Ministry or Diaconate, which may be lifted by the General Assembly of 2013. When asked to respond to the Scottish Government's consultation on same-sex marriage, the Church's Legal Questions Committee submitted a response which upheld a biblical and traditional understanding of marriage as a voluntary lifelong union between one man and one woman (December 2011). After this, the Church's first openly gay minister, Revd. Scott Rennie, claimed to the press that such ostracisation of homosexuals will empty churches. In 2016, the General Assembly voted in favor of allowing ministers to enter into same-sex marriages. On 25 May 2017, the General Assymbly voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriages in Church of Scotland.BBC:Kirk's General Assembly moves towards allowing gay marriage, 25 May 2017 In May 2018, the General Assembly passed a vote by 345 to 170, for a motion which tasked a committee with drafting church law on the issue of same-sex marriage.

Presbyterian Church in Ireland  In May 2006, a church spokesperson announced that clergy could bless same-gender partnerships. However, that announcement was reversed by General Assembly when it voted to ban its ministers from blessing same-gender partnerships in June 2006. The Presbyterian Church in Ireland is currently strongly opposed to same sex marriage.https://www.presbyterianireland.org/News/Article/2013-(1)/Presbyterians- Make-Clear-Their-Opposition-To-Same?feed=cfd8e3f5-88c6-46c8-9f48-6f31a698b9b7 Presbyterian Church (USA) The Presbyterian Church USA General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission ruled in 2006 that same-sex ceremonies are not forbidden, as long as they are not considered to be the same as marriage services. Debate on the issue within the church evolved over the years. In 2000, the General Assembly had approved language for the church constitution that stated church teachings were that people were ‚Äúto live either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or in chastity in singleness.,\\" and barred church officers and property from being used for blessing or approval upon any other form of fidelity relationship, but ratification for this language was never obtained by the presbyteries. By 2014, the General Assembly passed an Authoritative Interpretation permitting pastors to sign marriage licences for same-gender couples where permitted by civil law in the states where their church was found, which took immediate effect.http://www.pc-biz.org/PC- Biz.WebApp_deploy/(S(zbcely2njokyzcp51e0oharv))/IOBView.aspx?m=ro&id;=4599 On March 17, 2015, ratification by a majority of presbyteries was reached on a constitutional amendment passed by that same 2014 General Assembly, which broadened the definition of marriage in the Directory for Worship from only being between ‚Äúa man and a woman,‚Äù to ‚Äútwo people, traditionally a man and a woman,‚Äù thus giving official sanction to, while not making it mandatory for, any congregation's pastor to preside over and bless marriage ceremonies for same-gender couples.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/us/presbyterians-give- final-approval-for-same-sex-marriage.html =Connexional polities= Methodism There are a variety of responses within Methodism some of which have been favorable to a greater or lesser extent to same-sex unions or marriages. = Methodist Church of Great Britain = In 2005, the Methodist Church of Great Britain voted to allow a local option for ministers who wish to perform same-sex blessings, with a Church spokesperson stating that ‚ÄúWe have decided, with the law changing in December, we as a Church need to provide guidance to our ministers, who will be allowed to take an individual decision as to whether or not they want to bless gay couples.‚Äù In 2006, the Church reversed itself and prohibited the blessing of same-sex unions on or off church property. Ministers are still at liberty to offer informal, private prayers for such couples. However, in 2014, the church allowed ministers to enter into same-sex marriages and to offer celebratory services for same-sex marriages. In Juliy 2019, the Methodist Church of Great Britain allowed blessings of same-sex marriages.Church Times: Methodists move towards conducting same-sex marriages, 4 July 2019. = United Methodist Church = On May 7, 2018 the Bishops in the United Methodist Church, a denomination long divided on questions of LGBT equality, have proposed allowing individual pastors and regional church bodies to decide whether to ordain LGBT clergy and perform same-sex weddings.Advocate: Methodist Bishops Back Choice on LGBT Clergy, Same-Sex Marriage The United Methodist Church prohibited until 2018 celebrations of same-sex unions by its elders and in its churches. However, while \\"clergy cannot preside over the wedding ceremony...bishops say, clergy can assist same-gender couples in finding other venues for their wedding; provide pre-marital counseling; attend the ceremony; read Scripture, pray or offer a homily\\". Moreover, the church approved spousal benefits for non-ordained employees in same-sex marriages in states that allow such marriages. The church does not nationally allow the ordination of gay or lesbian pastors, but some Jurisdictions and Annual Conferences have begun to ordain gay and lesbian pastors and same-sex marriages or have passed resolutions supporting such ceremonies. The Baltimore-Washington, California- Nevada, California-Pacific, Desert Southwest, Detroit, Greater New Jersey, Great Plains, Illinois Great Rivers, Iowa, Minnesota, New England, New York, Northern Illinois, Oregon-Idaho, Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountain, Southwest Texas, Upper New York, Virginia, West Michigan, and Wisconsin Annual Conferences have passed resolutions supporting same-sex couples or the ordination of gay and lesbian clergy. In 2016, the New York Annual Conference ordained the denomination's first openly gay and lesbian clergy. Following those ordinations, the Western Jurisdiction elected and consecrated the church's first openly gay and partnered bishop. = African Methodist Episcopal Church = The African Methodist Episcopal Church, which is in full communion with the UMC, currently prohibits its ministers from officiating same-sex weddings, but it does not have an official policy on gay pastors and, therefore, gay ministers have been ordained in the AME. = Evangelical Methodist Church in Argentina = The Evangelical Methodist Church in Argentina allows \\"the freedom to accompany homosexual couples\\" in ministry. Each congregation is, therefore, free to determine its own policy. = Evangelical Methodist Church in Uruguay = The Evangelical Church in Uruguay, a Methodist denomination, has \\"resolved that pastors that wish to minister to homosexuals may do so freely\\". Each pastor is free to provide blessing services for same-sex unions if he or she chooses to do so. = Methodist Church of New Zealand = In 2004, the Methodist Church of New Zealand approved the ordination of gay and lesbian clergy; each congregation is able to determine its own position on the issue. =Congregational polities= Baptist Churches The Alliance of Baptists has in the past supported the legal right to marry;Same Sex Union its position on corollary church services is unclear. The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship nationally opposes same-sex marriage, but its local congregations remain free to discern the issue for themselves and many congregations have pledged to perform same- sex weddings. Additionally, congregations of the American Baptist Churches USA are locally autonomous and free to support same-sex marriages if they so choose.  Quakers  The first recorded same sex marriage by a Quaker meeting in the US was in 1987. In January, 1987, Morningside Monthly Meeting of the Society of Friends became the first Quaker Meeting to take a same-sex marriage (using the word marriage, rather than \\"commitment ceremony\\") under its care with the marriage of John Bohne and William McCann on May 30, 1987. Same-sex couples have been married under the care of many \\"unprogrammed\\" Quaker meetings in Canada since 1992.

Australian Quakers had been blessing same-sex unions since 1994. The Canada Yearly Meeting stated in 2003 that Canadian Quakers \\"support the right of same-sex couples to a civil marriage and the extension of the legal definition of marriage to include same-sex couples.\\" Since then a number of same-sex marriages have been performed at Canadian Monthly Meetings. In New Zealand, the Aotearoa Quaker Meeting in 1995 pledged ‚Äúto seek formal ways of recognizing a variety of commitments, including gay and lesbian partnerships.‚Äù United Church of Christ Varies by church. The General Synod of the United Church of Christ has passed a resolution affirming \\"equal marriage rights for couples regardless of gender and declares that the government should not interfere with couples regardless of gender who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities and commitment of legally recognized marriage\\".http://www.ucc.org/assets/pdfs/2005-equal- marriage-rights-for-all-1.pdf At its 25th General Synod in 2005, the UCC passed the resolution, \\"Equal Marriage Rights for All\\".

(The General Synod does not have authority over Local Churches to determine or enforce denominational doctrine)UCC Constitution and Bylaws. Paragraph 9 in Article V (Local churches) of the UCC Constitution states that \\"The basic unit of the life and organization of the United Church of Christ is the Local Church.\\" Paragraph 18 in the same article enshrines local church autonomy, and says: \\"Nothing in this constitution and the Bylaws of the United Church of Christ shall destroy or limit the right of each Local Church to continue to operate in the way customary to it; nor shall be construed as giving to the General Synod, or to any Conference or Association now, or at any future time, the power to abridge or impair the autonomy of any Local Church in the management of its own affairs.\\" Canadian Unitarian Council Canadian Unitarian churches perform same-sex marriage as well.Weddings  Canadian Unitarian Council Unitarian Universalist Association Unitarian Universalists perform same-sex marriages, and have supported marriage equality since 1973,UUA: Marriage Equality reaffirming with a formal resolution in 1996.UUA: Support of the Right to Marry for Same-Sex Couples ‚Äì 1996 Resolution of Immediate of Witness Metropolitan Community Church The predominantly gay Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches performs same-sex marriages.MCC:Marriage=Equality Mennonite Church The Mennonite Church in the Netherlands offers marriage to both heterosexual and same-gender couples.

Some Christian bodies are exploring the manner in which same-sex couples could or should be blessed (or not) by the church.Report to the General Convention on the Blessing of Same-Sex Relationships Because same-sex religious unions are not widespread and because civil unions do not require religious officiation, documentation of the incidence of church blessing of same-sex couples is difficult. = Roman Catholic Church = During the 1990s, a discussion began in the Roman Catholic Church about blessings for same-sex unions. Central teaching remains clear that such unions can in no ways be sanctioned by the Catholic Church. However, there are exceptions when individual priests carry out informal blessings. They risk being disciplined if the blessing is discovered. notable numbers of German clerics have openly disobeyed this teaching: *In the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aachen in Germany, five same-sex unions received a blessing in German town of M√∂nchengladbach.Spiegel:Riskanter Segen f√ºr gleichgeschlechtliche Paare *In 2007, one same-sex union received a blessing in German town of Wetzlar in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg.Frankfurter Rundschau:Dakan mu√ü gehen wegen Trauung eines homosexuellen Paares *In October 2014 a blessing of a same-sex union took place in B√ºrglen, Uri, Switzerland.nachrichten.at: R√∂misch- katholischer Priester segnete lesbisches Paar (german) The priest subsequently made a public apology. *A blessing of a same-sex union, equivalent to marriage except name, took place by a Catholic Dominican priest in Malta in 2015.https://newwaysministryblog.wordpress.com/2015/04/15/priest-blesses-same- gender-couples-engagement-in-malta-archbishop-remains-calm/Independent: Priest blesses rings at gay vouple engagement ceremony *In May 2015 the Central Committee of German Catholics voted in favour of blessing of same-sex unions.Bayerischer Rundfunk: Segnung von Homo-Ehen gefordert (German) * In 2015, Belgian bishop Johan Bonny from Antwerpen supported blessing of same-sex marriages.Religionnews: Belgian bishop Johan Bonny says catholic church should blrss same-sex couples, 2015 * In 2017, the association We are Church supported blessing of same-sex marriages.Zeit.de: Und wie reagieren die Kirchen?, 2017 (german) *In January 2018 German bishop Franz-Josef Bode of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Osnabr√ºck said in an interview with German journalists, that the blessing of same-sex unions is possible in German Roman Catholic churches.NDR.de: Bischof f√ºr Segnung von homosexuellen Paaren (German), 10 January 2018 *In February 2018, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, Archbishop of Munich and Freising and chairman of the German Bishops' Conference, said in an interview with German journalists that the blessing of same-sex unions is possible in German Roman Catholic churches.Bayrischer Rundfunk.de: \\"Segnung homosexueller Paare ist m√∂glich\\"Spiegel.de: Kardinal Marx stellt Segnung homosexueller Paare in Aussicht In Austria blessing of same-sex unions are allowed in Roman Catholic Diocese of Linz.Queer.de:Zum Valentinstag: Katholische Di√∂zese segnet auch Homo-Paare(german) *In the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aachen over fifty blessings of same-sex unions have been held in recent years.Evangelisch.de: Inofiziell segnen katholische Pfarrer immer wieder homosexuelle Paare (german) *In German Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn blessings of same-sex unions were allowed in Dortmund.evangelisch.de: \\"Ich finde, dieses Anliegen kann man nicht ignorieren\\" (german) * In September 2019, in Swiss Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel blessings of same-sex marriages were allowed from bishop Felix Gm√ºr.Advocate.com: Swiss Catholic Diocese OK With Marriage Equality, Sort Of, 16 September 2019 * in May 2020, Austrian Romac catholic theologian Ewald Volgger published with support of Roman Catholic bishop Franz Lackner a book The benediction of same sex partnerships with liturgical advices, how a worship for blessings of same-sex partnerships can be.NesWaysMinistry: Archdiocese of Salzburg Publishes New Book on Church Blessings for Same-Gender Couples * in April/June 2020 Roman-catholic German bishops Helmut Dieser from Roman Catholic Diocese of Aachen and Georg B√§tzing from Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg said, blessings of same-sex unions in Roman Catholic church should be allowed.Domradio.de: Reformen im Blick, 11.

Under the Austrian Netherlands, civil registrations (births, deaths, marriages) were left to the parishes, and linked to sacraments administered by the Church. From June 1796, this changed: registrations were performed by a civil registration officer. Luxembourg was a Catholic society, in which religion was omnipresent and resistant to change. In this traditional society, the secularisation of marriage and the introduction of divorce were fault lines, which caused great consternation. The institutions and administrative machinery introduced by the French in this period is the origin of today's government institutions in Luxembourg: districts (arrondissements), cantons and communes were introduced under the French, and continue to exist. French rule in Luxembourg provoked widespread discontent, and the causes for this are several: religious persecutions, the suppression of the religious orders in the city of Luxembourg, military requisitions, taxation, and the introduction of obligatory military service from 1798. This discontent culminated in the Peasants' War that same year, a revolt in the northern part of the department that was limited to the peasantry. Among other classes of society, however, the benefits of the Napoleonic reforms did meet with a level of appreciation. At the same time, a fundamental characteristic of the French Revolutionary government, administrative centralisation, collided with Luxembourgish traditions: each department received a central commissioner. The department of For√™ts saw four commissioners over the years, all of them from France proper. =Economy= In the city of Luxembourg, due to the abolition of the corporations, a commercial and artisanal revolution took place, allowing a middle class to emerge, whose members could for the first time participate in political life under the French regime. Another development linked to the disappearance of the corporations occurred in the countryside: small artisanal business sprang up, often with only one employee. Employer and worker would enjoy a certain proximity, eating at the same table. In 1803, the livret d'ouvrier (labourer's booklet) was introduced. This was to list what work labourers did for whom, and a reference from their last employer every time they changed workplace. If travelling without their booklet, they could be reported as a vagabond, and punished accordingly. The Code civil's Article 1781 established the \\"legal superiority of the employer,\\" while the Code p√©nal in 1810 forbade workers from forming trade unions. These provisions were evidence of a great mistrust of the world of the workers, who were seen as a danger to society. The overarching objective of the livret d'ouvrier was to keep under surveillance a social class judged seen as dangerous, and to prevent poaching of labourers amongst competing enterprises, in this period of manpower shortages. Finally, it represented an \\"effective means of domination by the employers,\\" and \\"a veritable internal passport.\\" Legacy The Code civil, introduced by the French, had a profound impact on Luxembourgish society, and is still in force 200 years later. Luxembourgish law remains close to French law: Luxembourgish law students study in France or in Belgium. Arguments before the courts, and the announcement of verdicts, are conducted in French. Laws and regulations were published in French and German from 1816, but since 1945, only in French.

They are known also as the rufous mouse lemur, eastern rufous mouse lemur, red mouse lemur, or russet mouse lemur. Its dorsal side is brown or reddish-brown, while ventrally it is a whitish-grey. It was originally considered a subspecies of the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) until 1977, when it was reclassified as a separate species. The mouse lemurs are among the shortest-lived of primates. The brown mouse lemur has a lifespan of 6‚Äì8 years in the wild, although it averages 12 years under human care.

Fast ice (also called land-fast ice, landfast ice, and shore-fast ice) is sea ice that is \\"fastened\\" to the coastline, to the sea floor along shoals or to grounded icebergs.Lepp√§ranta, M. 2011. The Drift of Sea Ice. Berlin: Springer-Verlag. Fast ice may either grow in place from the sea water or by freezing pieces of drifting ice to the shore or other anchor sites.Kovacs, A.and M.

Sater (Eds.), Arlington, Va.: U.S.A. Unlike drift (or pack) ice, fast ice does not move with currents and winds. The width (and the presence) of this ice zone is usually seasonal and depends on ice thickness, topography of the sea floor and islands. It ranges from a few meters to several hundred kilometers. Seaward expansion is a function of a number of factors, notably water depth, shoreline protection, time of year and pressure from the pack ice. In Arctic seas the fast ice extends up to the depths of , while in the Subarctic seas, the zone extends to depths of about . In some coastal areas with abrupt shelf and no islands, e.g., in the Sea of Okhotsk off Hokkaid≈ç, tides prevent the formation of any fast ice. Smaller ocean basins may contain only the fast ice zone with no pack ice (e.g. McMurdo Sound in Antarctica). The topography of the fast ice varies from smooth and level to rugged (when submitted to large pressures). The ice foot refers to ice that has formed at the shoreline, through multiple freezing of water between ebb tides, and is separated from the remainder of the fast ice surface by tidal cracks. Further away from the coastline, the ice may become anchored to the sea bottom‚Äîit is then referred to as bottomfast ice. Fast ice can survive one or more melting seasons (i.e. summer), in which case it can be designated following the usual age-based categories: first-year, second-year, multiyear.

It is the fourth book in the Honor Harrington series, the only book in the series to not feature space warfare.  Plot summary  Immediately following The Short Victorious War, Honor returns to Manticore as a hero following the victory at Hancock Station, her ship undergoing much needed repairs. Captain Pavel Young, Honor's bitterest enemy, is about to face a court-martial for cowardice before the enemy, punishable by death. Under threat from Young's father, Earl North Hollow, Young is instead demoted and dishonorably discharged from the Navy. Despite the reprieve, North Hollow suffers a fatal heart attack and Young becomes the new Earl of North Hollow. The Star Kingdom officially declares war on the People's Republic of Haven. Seeking revenge on Honor, Pavel Young first tries to discredit her and then hires a professional duelist, former Royal Marine Denver Summervale, to challenge Honor's lover Paul Tankersley to a duel. Paul is killed by Summervale while Honor is on Grayson overseeing her Steading and formally being appointed Steadholder, as promised in The Honor of the Queen. Paul's death is a severe blow to Honor, and she determines to kill Summervale no matter the cost to herself. Several of Honor's friends and comrades track Summervale to a hidden retreat where they force him to confess to being hired to kill Paul, though this immediately guarantees his immunity to prosecution given the way the confession is extracted. Honor confronts Summervale and goads him into challenging her by calling him a paid assassin before witnesses. Both Young and Summervale are confidently expecting Honor to be killed, but she slaughters Summervale in the following duel. Honor then proclaims to the assembled media that Summervale was hired to kill Paul Tankersley and herself by Pavel Young. Young goes into hiding, to deny Honor from an opportunity to challenge him, planning to wait until repairs on the Nike are completed and Honor is shipped back to the front. Despite being ordered by Earl White Haven to not pursue Young, Honor uses a technicality of the House of Lords chamber rules to demand that she be formally seated with them, and uses the opportunity to denounce Young publicly and challenge him to a duel. Risking total loss of face and political strength, Young is forced to agree. In the duel, Young panics and turns, shooting Honor in the back, before being cut down by Honor before the Master of the field can even react. The outraged aristocracy removes Honor from the House of Lords and political pressure forces the navy to remove Honor from command and place her on half- pay, with no active assignment. Honor decides to return to Grayson until the crisis subsides.

The best known part is situated on two small islets. The main artillery batteries are on the island H√•√∏ya and smaller batteries on the mainland to the west and east in the fjord and was military territory until 2003 when it was made a publicly available resort island. The fortress is best known for sinking the German heavy cruiser Bl√ºcher on 9 April 1940. In 2014, Oscarsborg Fortress was given protected status. Early history Map of Oslofjord and the fortress of Oscarsborg Oberst Birger Eriksen, the commander of Oscarsborg on 9 April 1940. Harbour Fortress on South Kaholmen. The 28 cm guns are on this island on the left, the torpedo battery to the right. Scars in the rock are over the torpedo exit tunnels. The Old Barracks in the background One of the three 28 cm main battery guns at Oscarsborg. The narrows at Dr√∏bak, called Dr√∏baksundet, is a natural point for the naval defence of Oslo, the capital of Norway. The first defences were constructed during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and Norway and were ready in 1644. The fortifications were however not involved in battle during the Hannibal War.National Fortresses of Norway: Historical overview of Oscarsborg Fortress After the war the fortifications were dismantled, and only resurrected for a short period during the 1814 war with Sweden. Around 1830 the discussion started for a renewed fortification of the Dr√∏bak Narrows and the first stage was ready in 1848, the next in 1853. The name of the fortress was given by royal resolution on 23 August 1855 after a visit by the Swedish-Norwegian King Oscar I. By the end of the 19th century the art of war developed rapidly and the new fortress was soon obsolete. The tension was also growing between the two countries in the union and so the Norwegians decided to upgrade the fortress. From 1890 new improved German guns were installed, an underwater barrier was built in 1874‚Äì79,Berg 1997: 10 and an underwater torpedo battery was constructed. The main armament was three 28 cm calibre guns(11 inch) manufactured by Krupp. There were also a number of guns with smaller calibres (15 cm and 57 mm) on the mainland. An underwater barrier went from the main islet of Kaholmen and south-west to Hurum on the western side of the fjord, thus making it impossible for large vessels to sail west of the fortress. 20th century =Torpedo battery= Having been constructed in 1898‚Äì1901,Fjeld 1999: 159 and put into service on 15 July 1901,Sivertsen 2001: 165 the underground torpedo facility remained one of the few Norwegian defence installations unknown to German military intelligence at the point of the 9 April 1940 invasion. The battery was one of two in Norway and differed from the other torpedo battery, at Kvarven Fort, in that it was designed to launch its torpedoes from under the water level,Stangeland&Valebrokk; 2001: 260 instead of by torpedo tube from above ground as was the case with the battery at Kvarven outside Bergen. At Oscarsborg the torpedo battery is a concrete construction inside a cave mined into the rock of the North Kaholmen island. Two torpedoes are loaded side by side, in two open steel frames. Then one of the two frames is lowered like an elevator down into the water to the tunnels below. After one shot, it took some time to swap frames and be ready for the next. When fired, the torpedo's own compressed air engine was started and it propelled itself. The battery has three torpedo tunnels which could fire six torpedoes without reloading and a total of nine torpedoes was stored and ready for use. Each weapon carried a 100 kg TNT warheadFjeld 1999: 160 and targets were spotted from three observation bunkers just above the battery. The torpedoes were delivered in 1900 from the Whitehead torpedo factory in Fiume, then part of Austria- Hungary.Berg 1997: 11 A back-up observation bunker is situated just outside the entrance to the battery. =Second World War= When Norway was invaded on 9 April 1940, all of the fortress' armament was over 40 years old, and of German origin. Both the guns and the torpedo battery worked flawlessly when Oscarsborg encountered one of the German invasion flotillas; they sank the heavy cruiser Bl√ºcher, and threw back the German naval force heading for Oslo, thus managing to save the Norwegian King and government from being taken prisoner. During the occupation of Norway, German forces were stationed at Oscarsborg. The fortress was returned to Norwegian control on 12 May 1945 when Captain Thorleif Unneberg took command of the fortifications and raised the Norwegian flag following the capitulation of all German forces in Norway four days earlier. The flag in question was the same that had flown over the fortress until it was captured by the Germans in April 1940. Colonel Birger Eriksen was present on the occasion and made a speech.Sivertsen 2001: 112 After the Second World War 100th anniversary plaque at Oscarsborg Fortress During the Cold War Oscarsborg formed a last line of defence for Oslo, with the underground torpedo battery remaining secretly active up until 1 January 1993, having been modernized in the 1980s. After the deactivation of the last weapons systems, the remaining military activity on Oscarsborg consisted of the Coastal Artillery officer training programme. The officer school was officially shut down on 28 June 2002.Kongsberg Defence Association: Guided tour of Oscarsborg Fortress The fortress is now largely a civilian resort and attraction, open for visitors. The scenic surroundings is much used for conferences and excursions.National Fortresses of Norway: Activities at Oscarsborg Visitors take a short motor launch trip from Dr√∏bak.National Fortresses of Norway: Ferry service to Oscarsborg's main island On 8 April 2014 the 28 cm guns of the main battery were fired with blank rounds when the fortress was used as a location of a scene for the production of the 2016 film The King's Choice, directed by Erik Poppe. In their coverage of the filming the newspaper Aftenposten claimed that the filming occasion was the first time the guns had been fired since 9 April 1940. The claim by Aftenposten is however contradicted by the fact that the guns were actually last fired during testing in 1952. After a prolonged process, Oscarsborg Fortress was listed as a protected site in 2014, effective from 9 April 2014.

Headed by retired Quebec Superior Court judge Jules Desch√™nes, the commission delivered its report in December 1986 after almost two years of hearings. In 1985, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney ordered an investigation into the presence of Nazi war criminals in Canada after a member of Parliament claimed infamous Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele might be in the country.Grant Purves, \\"War Criminals: The Desch√™nes Commission\\", 1998. The establishment of the commission put the Canadian Jewish community at odds with the Baltic- and Ukrainian-Canadian communities. The Baltic and Ukrainian groups objected to the use of evidence from the Soviet Union and other Iron Curtain countries. and also objected to the selective mandate of the Commission, which made no effort to investigate the presence of a small number of Soviet war criminals - veterans of the NKVD, SMERSH and KGB - who were identified as being in Canada. The commission compiled a list of 774 potential war criminals in Canada. 341 of them never landed or resided in Canada, 21 had landed in Canada but had left for another country, 86 had died in Canada, and 4 could not be located. The commission found prima facie evidence against 20 individuals; another 169 cases were not acted upon because of a lack of access to overseas evidence or time constraints.In 97 cases, the Commission could not find prima facie evidence of war crimes, but believed that such evidence might exist in East European countries. Late in 1986, the commission turned the names of the 20 people over to the government with recommendations on how to proceed in each case. The commission also recommended changes to criminal and citizenship law. In June 1987, the House of Commons passed legislation that allowed for the prosecution of foreign war crimes in Canadian courts and the deportation of naturalized war criminals. Canadian prosecutors pressed charges against at least four men on allegations of participation in Holocaust war crimes. One case ended in acquittal; two cases were dropped when prosecutors had trouble obtaining overseas evidence; the fourth case was stayed due to the health of the defendant. Since 1998, courts have found that six men misrepresented their wartime activities and could have their citizenship revoked although this was not done because the evidence was circumstantial and insufficient. Another seven people subject to deportation or citizenship-revocation procedures have died. Despite calls for an investigation into Soviet war criminals in Canada (former members of the NKVD, SMERSH and KGB, of whom several self-identified and remained in Canada without repercussion) no such inquiry was ever held. More recently documentary evidence has emerged from declassified Soviet-era archives confirming that the Soviets deliberately sowed discord between the Jewish and Ukrainian diasporas - Operation Payback - in order to thwart any common front emerging between these communities, precasting this divisiveness by provoking the formation of the OSI (Department of Justice) in the USA and the Deschenes Commission in Canada Deschenes Commission confirmed war criminal numbers 'grossly exaggerated'.

The school has four divisions, each with its own director: Preschool (Pre-kindergarten/Kindergarten), Lower School (grades 1-4), Middle School (grades 5-8) and Upper School (grades 9-12). These are arrayed on three campuses that comprise four acres. Thirty-eight percent of Durham Academy's students are people of color, as are 17 percent of teachers. In 2019-20, Durham Academy awarded more than $2,200,000 in financial aid (not including tuition remission and need-based financial aid for faculty and staff); the average award was $14,682. Durham Academy's official mission is \\"to provide each student an education that will enable him or her to live a moral, happy and productive life.\\" History Durham Academy was founded in 1933, as the Calvert Method School, by George Watts Hill and his wife Ann McCollough Hill. The couple established the school as a private, independent school to educate their children. The school's teaching philosophy (and its name) were based on the Calvert School in Baltimore, Maryland, which Ann McCollough Hill attended as a child. The Calvert Method School's first home was in Durham's Forest Hills neighborhood, with the neighborhood's clubhouse serving as a classroom for seven students and one teacher. In 1937, the Calvert Method School moved to John Sprunt Hill's former home at 815 S. Duke Street. In 1959, the school ended its affiliation with Baltimore's Calvert School and changed its name to Durham Academy. Durham Academy also became a member of the National Council of Independent Schools and added an eighth grade. In May 1965, Durham Academy broke ground on a new campus on Highway 751 (later named Academy Road). Students and teachers moved into the new facility in March 1966. Durham Academy added to the Academy Road campus during the early 1970s. Plans for a starting high school were also explored. In 1971, Durham Academy purchased and broke ground on 42 acres of land on Ridge Road to launch the Upper School. The Upper School opened in September 1973, and Durham Academy's first senior class graduated in June 1975. George Watts Hill and Frank Hawkins Kenan were both instrumental in the creation of Durham Academy's Upper School. Kenan, whose children had attended Calvert Method School and later Durham Academy, made an anonymous gift of $1 million to build the Upper School campus. George Watts Hill established an endowment for Durham Academy, to which Kenan later contributed nearly $3 million. In 1977, George Watts Hill, Fred Brooks and Bill Friday founded the Learning Development Center (now known as The Hill Center), for children with learning differences. The LDC, located on Durham Academy's Ridge Road campus, had a close relationship with Durham Academy, but had its own faculty and a separate facility for its 13 students and four teachers. The Hill Center currently operates as an affiliate of Durham Academy in its facility on Pickett Rd. The center's focus is on intensive remediation and tutoring for students with learning differences and training teachers to help students with learning differences. By 1978 Durham Academy had grown to 795 students in grades K-12\\\\. From the late 1970s to early 1980s the school developed an honor code, a Cum Laude Society, a faculty summer grants program and established an excellence in teaching award named after then-headmaster F. Robertson Hershey. In 1983, Durham Academy celebrated its 50th anniversary with ceremonies led by founder George Watts Hill. In 1986, the school added to the Academy Road campus with a new library/arts/science building. That same year, Durham Academy began hosting the Durham County Special Olympics, which includes an estimated 400 athletes from all Durham County Public Schools. Upper School students and faculty plan the annual event. The entire Upper School closes on the day of the games so that students and faculty can all volunteer and host the athletes. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw major Middle School and Upper School expansions, the systematic development of Upper School experiential education programming and growth in the number of Durham Academy athletic teams to twice their size. In the mid-1990s, Durham Academy parent Gary Hock donated a 6,000-square foot building to house computer classrooms and a computer library. In August 2002, Durham Academy's Preschool and Lower School moved to 17 acres on the Ridge Road campus. The building opened has been recognized by the Chicago Athenaeum: Museum of Architecture and Design for its unique style. In 2004, the school was ranked first in the Southeast by the New York Times and 30th in the nation by Forbes. During the 2008-09 school year, Durham Academy celebrated its 75th anniversary. The Upper School Learning Commons opened in February 2012. The 7,000-square foot building includes a library, college counseling, a student store, a faculty work room, and a computer lab with 20 iMac stations. The building also houses classroom and office space. The Upper School Kirby Gym opened in January 2013.

Plot summary  As the story begins, Honor returns to her Steading on Grayson, having just been promoted to Commodore for her actions in Honor Among Enemies. During a party celebrating her promotion, she engages in a heated debate with Earl White Haven, her superior, and the two realize they have mutual unspoken romantic feelings for each other. In an attempt to escape her own feelings, Honor goes with Alistair McKeon on a convoy escort mission to the Adler system, which has been captured by Citizen Rear Admiral Lester Tourville of the DuQuesne base, under the orders of Citizen Admiral Thomas Theisman, in order to capture or destroy a large chunk of Manticoran shipping. Spotting the ambush and after salvaging what she can of her convoy from Havenite attack, Honor orders McKeon to surrender. After learning of Honor's capture Cordelia Ransom, the People's Republic's Secretary for Public Information, who is present at Admiral Theismans' headquarters doing a propaganda piece, demands that the Manticorans be surrendered to her for propaganda uses. Unable to deny Ransom and her StateSec enforcers, Admiral Theisman capitulates. The crew are transferred to the Havenite battlecruiser PNS Tepes, Ransom's personal flagship, bound for the Havenite prison planet of Hades, where Ransom intends to execute Honor for a death sentence handed down by the prior government (on trumped up charges). Ransom gives any crew member serving under Harrington a chance to defect and Senior Chief Petty Officer Harkness takes up the offer claiming that Manticore have never really done anything for him. Unbeknownst to StateSec, Harkness has no intention of truly defecting, and after fooling his assigned watchdogs, hacks into the security and communication systems, eventually disabling them and causing massive explosions in the boat bays. Freeing the rest of the crew, they manage to destroy the Tepes and land on Cerberus B 2, facing a well-provided for prison camp and unknown amounts of State Security forces.

The airport was planned to be set in the city of Pickering, Ontario, about east of Toronto Pearson International Airport. As of December 2019 no operator had been selected. In 2004, the estimated cost of building the airport was reported to be approximately $2 billion, and it was anticipated that, by 2032, it would be handling up to 11.9 million passengers annually.Cf. Transport Canada, Plan Showing Pickering Airport Site. The plans for the airport were developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s. A large tract of land in Pickering, Uxbridge, and Markham townships was expropriated for the airport in 1972‚Äì1973. Opposition to the project was widespread. Preliminary airport construction activity was halted in 1975 when the provincial partner in the enterprise, the Government of Ontario, declared it would not build the roads or sewers needed to service the site. In 2010, the GTAA completed a Pickering Airport \\"Needs Assessment Study\\" commissioned by the federal government. The study's report recommended that the federal government retain the Pickering lands, \\"thereby preserving the option of building an airport, if and when required\\".GTAA. \\"Needs Assessment Study: Pickering Lands, Final Report\\" (2010), ch. 12, p. 9. The Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, an association of private plane owners and pilots, took exception to the methodology and conclusions of the study, arguing that \\"the process to implement a new airport at Pickering should be well underway right now\\".Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, Review of the GTAA \\"Needs Assessment Study ‚Äì Pickering Lands\\" (2011), 4.4, p. 52. Transport Action Ontario, in its own response to the study report, questioned some of the study's claims and suggested that, in lieu of building a new airport, \\"higher-speed, electrified rail\\" would be a \\"far superior alternative\\" for much of the short-haul traffic currently handled by Pearson Airport.Transport Action Ontario, \\"Response to: Transport Canada Needs Assessment Study ‚Äì Pickering Lands\\" (February 2014), p.2. In an announcement in June 2013, the federal government reaffirmed its intention to hold land on the site for a future airport, stating that the needs assessment study's conclusion was that the airport would be needed within the 2027‚Äì2037 time-frame.Cf. Transport Canada, Press Release, June 11, 2013. By July 2015, the federal government had permanently protected more than half of the farmland and natural habitat on the site by adding it to the Rouge National Urban Park.Parks Canada, Press Release, July 17, 2015. It announced its intention to use the remainder of the site for economic development, including a potential future airport. In 2016 Transport Canada released the Polonsky report. It was billed as the first independent study done on the Pickering lands in a generation. Dr. Polonsky's first recommendation: Undertake the analysis required to make a decision on the need for an airport.Polonsky Report Press Release KPMG was then commissioned by Transport Canada to complete a million-dollar \\"Pickering Lands Aviation Sector Analysis\\". This report was expected to be released in 2019 and will be the basis for a decision on the timing of a potential future airport. History =1969‚Äì1975= In the late 1960s, the federal government (which then owned and operated all major Canadian airports) studied expanding Malton Airport (now Toronto Pearson International Airport) to accommodate the tremendous growth in air passenger traffic anticipated in the coming decades. Strong local-community opposition to Malton's expansion caused the government to decide instead, in December 1968, to build a second Toronto airport. An Airport Planning Team spent 1969 evaluating nearly 60 sites within a 50-nautical-mile radius of Malton. The final contenders were Lake Scugog, Lake Simcoe, Orangeville, and Guelph, with the Guelph site ranked highest.Szende, Andrew. \\"Airport document shows planners didn't want Pickering\\" (April 10, 1972). The Toronto Star, pp. 1, 4. In May 1971, in a Toronto-Centred Region plan, the provincial government announced its intention to direct new growth to the east of Toronto. This eastern emphasis became a cause of friction between the federal and provincial governments: the federal government preferred an airport location to the west, the province wanted an eastern site. In an attempt to resolve the impasse, the federal government proposed a plan to build three new airports instead of one. Two small 2,000‚Äì4,000 hectare (5,000‚Äì10,000 acre) airports would be built to handle short-haul traffic, on sites previously eliminated as unsuitable for a large airport. The first of these small airports would be constructed in the west, in Beverly Township, near Hamilton, followed immediately by the second one in the east, in Pickering Township. A third airport ‚Äì a large 6,000‚Äì8,000 hectare (15,000‚Äì20,000 acre) international airport ‚Äì would be built later, at an undetermined location. In December 1971, the province told the federal government that it could not afford to service both a Beverly and a Pickering site and that it had committed funds to build sewer and water facilities only to the east of Toronto. The federal government abandoned its plan for three new airports and decided instead to build one large international airport east of Toronto. On March 2, 1972, the federal Minister of Transport announced the construction of a \\"major airport\\" in Pickering, while the Treasurer of the Province of Ontario simultaneously announced plans for a new satellite city, called Cedarwood, to be built immediately south of the airport.Slinger, John. \\"Terminal open by 1979: City of 200,000 to rise near airport in Pickering\\" (March 3, 1972). Globe and Mail, p. 1. The federal government expropriated about 7,530 hectares (18,600 acres) of farmland for the airport, as well as the village of Brougham and the hamlet of Altona. Expropriation went ahead despite widespread public opposition and the Province's ongoing concerns. In September 1975, airport construction was halted when the Government of Ontario withdrew its agreement to provide the necessary infrastructure for the site. A similar major land expropriation had taken place in 1969, north of Montreal, for Montr√©al‚ÄìMirabel International Airport. Phase I of Mirabel opened in 1975, the same year that construction on the Pickering project was stopped. The federal government retained its ownership of the lands expropriated for the Pickering airport, reserving the option to revive the project at some point in the future. =1976‚Äìpresent= After the airport construction was stopped, the federal government began to lease the site's farmland and houses to tenants, some of them former owners of the properties. This practice continued, and there were no significant developments until 2001, when Transport Canada resurrected the airport idea and commissioned the GTAA to \\"undertake interim planning work that would enable the federal government to determine if it should proceed with a regional/reliever airport on the Pickering Lands\\". As the study got under way, the federal government designated the land as an airport site. In 2002, the federal government announced a plan to preserve 3,051 hectares (7,540 acres) of the site, no longer needed for the airport, as green space in perpetuity, providing a corridor of land connecting the Rouge Park with the Oak Ridges Moraine. Management and protection details of the Federal Green Space plan were never formalized. In November 2004, the GTAA submitted its Pickering Airport Draft Plan Report to Transport Canada. The plan was for a large three-runway reliever airport. The report also referred to the long history of agricultural activity on the Pickering lands and noted that the \\"fertile soils have led to the majority of the land being classified as Class 1 or 2 in the Canada Land Inventory soil capability classification for agriculture\\". The draft plan went into limbo when Transport Canada announced on May 9, 2007,Transport Canada that the GTAA had now been commissioned to complete \\"a needs assessment study for a potential Pickering airport\\". The Needs Assessment Study: Pickering Lands, Final Report was submitted to Transport Canada in March 2010. After a \\"due diligence review\\", Transport Canada released the report to the public on July 11, 2011. The study concluded that an additional airport would be needed \\"but it is not expected to be required before 2027 and possibly not before 2037\\". The studyTransport Canada recommended that the federal government \\"retain and protect the site, thereby preserving the option of building an airport, if and when required\\". On June 11, 2013, the federal finance minister announced revised plans for the Pickering airport lands, stating that the Government of Canada would set aside an area in the southeast, of about 3,500 hectares (8,700 acres), for a future airport that would be needed in the 2027‚Äì2037 time-frame.Transport Canada, Press Release, June 11, 2013; About 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres) in York Region would be transferred to Parks Canada, to become part of the new Rouge National Urban Park. The remaining land, approximately 2,000 hectares (4,900 acres), was earmarked for economic development. On April 1, 2015, Transport Canada transferred to Parks Canada a total of 1,911 hectares (4,722 acres) of the Federal Lands, the first tract of land to become part of the Rouge National Urban Park.Parks Canada, Press Release, March 31, 2015; Parks Canada has been working closely with tenants on that land and has made it clear that agriculture will be one of the central pillars of the new Park. On July 11, 2015, the Prime Minister announced that the federal government is transferring an additional 2,100 hectares (5,200 acres) in Pickering and Uxbridge to the Rouge National Urban Park. More than half of the farmland, streams, and natural habitat expropriated in 1972‚Äì1973 will now be permanently protected. The Prime Minister also said that the federal government intends to use the remaining lands for economic development, adding: \\"But let there be no doubt. Our Government will only support projects on these lands, including an airport, if they are backed by a sound business plan and if they are in the best interests of this community.\\"Prime Minister of Canada, Speech , July 11, 2015. On July 13, 2015, the federal Minister of Transport reaffirmed that the remaining lands were being retained for economic development, including a potential future airport, and indicated that an independent advisor will be appointed to consult with local public and private interests on potential economic opportunities on the site, including a future airport, and will report back to the government within 12 months. Meanwhile, Transport Canada will assess future aviation needs across the Greater Golden Horseshoe to determine if there is a business case for a future airport, confirming that no decisions have been made on the development or timing of a potential future airport.Transport Canada, Press Release, July 13, 2015. On July 18, 2015, Transport Canada released proposed revised Pickering Airport Site Zoning Regulations for the retained lands, to ensure that development on surrounding lands remains compatible with a potential future airport site.Transport Canada,Public Notice - Proposed Regulations For The Federally-Owned Pickering Lands, July 20, 2015. The farmland all across the site continues to be farmed by tenants, as it has been since the land was expropriated. Controversy =Pickering site selection= The selection process of the site for the new airport was controversial as all candidate locations were opposed by the local residents. The 1974 Gibson inquiry did review the process and found \\"No new evidence to suggest that Pickering site was not appropriate\\" (pp. 29‚Äì32, Airport Inquiry Commission, Justice Hugh Gibson). Local residents and several newspapers disagreed. It was claimed that In June 1971, a federal Department of Transport team, having visited the Pickering site with a consultant, reported that a Pickering airport would disrupt community development plans and destroy \\"high quality farmland\\", that the rolling countryside would be costly to level, and that the town of Claremont would have to be phased out. Furthermore, the site offered no room for expansion. It was suitable for a two-runway airport, with four runways possible \\"but with considerably greater difficulty\\". In August 1971, Ontario planners came to similar conclusions, stating that a Pickering airport would prevent the creation of two planned towns called Brock and Audley, destroy an area designated as a provincial agricultural and recreational preserve, and \\"have a major influence on the operation of Toronto International\\". Despite the site's drawbacks, which had led to Pickering's elimination early in the original site selection process, the federal announcement of March 1972, described Pickering as an \\"excellent\\" site. This was not the case. The Pickering site was chosen because it was the only site left in the provincially preferred area east of Toronto, after Lake Scugog had been disqualified for being too far out, too costly to develop, too important a recreational area to disrupt, and too prone to poor weather. The Lake Scugog site had also been described as \\"unfavourable, as the majority of users, as well as Malton airport itself, are separated from the site by Metropolitan Toronto\\". The argument helped to eliminate Lake Scugog but was never used against Pickering, although it is claimed that it applied there equally well. =Political decisions favouring a new airport over expansion of the existing airport= Well into the 1970s, the Department of Transport remained adamant that Malton could not be expanded, citing noise and safety concerns. However, there were also political reasons behind the federal government's wish to build a second airport. Representatives of the local anti-airport protest group, People or Planes, meeting in Ottawa in 1972 with Transport Minister Jean Marchand, were told by him that he did not want to be the \\"French Canadian who could be accused of not giving an airport to Ontario after having given one to Quebec [Mirabel]\\". Together with Minister Marchand's desire to give Toronto what he had just given Montreal, there was the advice of chief consultant Philip Beinhaker, of Peat Marwick and Partners, who, while admitting a preference for expanding Malton, had pronounced the expansion \\"politically unsaleable\\", in part because Malton and a vocal group of anti- expansion residents there were in Premier-in-waiting William Davis's electoral riding.Budden, Sandra. Ernst, Joseph. The Movable Airport. Hakkert, 1973, p. 5 Within months of the halt to construction at Pickering, new federal Transport Minister Otto Lang was announcing that no new air carriers would be allowed at Malton for at least five years. Malton's general manager accused federal officials of stalling improvements to the airport as a way of making Ontario reverse its position and provide support infrastructure for Pickering after all. In November 1978, Minister Lang told the House of Commons that Malton would not be expanded, and a study into a possible fourth runway was stopped. The interdiction did not last. Over the years, Toronto Pearson International has been expanded to five runways, with a sixth runway planned.[Celebrating Success, Greater Toronto Airports Authority, 2006, =Air passenger forecast inaccuracies= Numerous studies were undertaken in the late 1960s to determine whether Canada's airports could deal with future air passenger volumes. At Malton, passenger numbers in 1970 totalled 6.4 million, but consultants' forecasts for the turn of the century ranged from 25 million to 198 million. The federal government's plans for Malton and Pickering were ultimately based on an anticipated 60 million to 96 million passengers through Toronto by 2000. In 2000, Toronto Pearson International processed about 28 million passengers. By 2003, owing to international crises, that number had dropped to just over 24 million. By 2014, passenger numbers had climbed to nearly 39 million., about 62% of the 62 million passengers the GTAA is currently forecasting for Pearson by 2032. =Expropriation breach of faith= Thousands of acres of private property were expropriated in 1972 expressly for a large, public, international airport that the federal government said would be operational by 1979. The airport was never built, but the expropriated land was retained by the government. In 2004, the plan for a large international airport became a plan for a smaller, regional/reliever airport, to be operational in 2012. However, that airport was never built either. There were indications, triggered by the federal finance minister's comments in June 2013, that the aim might be smaller still: a little Pickering airport to replace Buttonville Airport when it closed.\\"The John Tory Show\\", interview of Hon. James Flaherty by Matt Gurney, June 12, 2013, CFRB Radio, Toronto. Transcript. Buttonville is a privately owned corporate jet and general aviation airport ‚Äì the kind of small airport the federal government, under its 1994 National Airports Policy, neither owns, operates, nor subsidizes. The Expropriation Act is a blunt instrument of last resort, not intended to be used by the Crown to seize citizens' private property for a specific \\"public work\\" and then give or sell that property to other citizens for their private uses and benefit should the \\"public work\\" not proceed. Airport opponents and farmland proponents argue that the federal government would be guilty of a breach of faith with regard to the Pickering site should it choose a way out that differs from the one chosen for the excess lands at Mirabel, also expropriated for an international airport but never needed: the Mirabel lands were returned to their original use, which, as at Pickering, was farming. =Community opposition= There has been significant community opposition to a Pickering airport, originally led by People or Planes, then by V.O.C.A.L. (Voters Organized to Cancel the Airport Lands), and since 2005, by Land Over Landings. =General aviation community concerns= There is strong support for Pickering Airport from COPA flight 44 Canadian Owners and Pilots Association also known as the Buttonville Flying Club. Both the Friends of Pickering Airport and an older 2011 privately funded proposal to build a not for profit Airpark in Pickering originated from this General Aviation community. This community of pilots supports keeping all nearby airports open including Buttonville, Oshawa and Markham. The Markham Airport, home to the Canadian Air Land Sea Museum, is the most at risk as it is right next door and under the approach to runway 10R at the new airport. In addition part of Markham airport, including half of its only runway, was originally expropriated for the Pickering airport. Questions on if the construction of the Pickering Airport next to an existing airport (Markham CNU8) would violate the Aeronautical Act have been raised by the airports opponents. The Markham Airport, has been around since 1965 and is currently looking to expand to a 6,000 ft runway and take-on the new role of private aviation airport if the closure of Buttonville Airport takes place. The land that Buttonville Airport sits on has been sold for development to Cadillac Fairview. No firm date for Buttonvilles closure has been announced. The city of Oshawa has passed a resolution in council affirming that Oshawa airport will remain open until 2032 or longer. There are no operational and physical constraints that would inhibit Oshawa airport from operating when Pickering opens. In the draft plan presented by the GTAA in 2004, it purpose closing all three GA airport to jumpstart traffic at Pickering airport. Mixing the displaced general aviation traffic with increased heavy passenger jet traffic is a concern to many small aircraft pilots who would have no choice but to use the new airport, as larger airports tend to be less GA friendly, and more difficult for student pilot training. =2015 federal election issue= The future of the Pickering Airport Lands became an election issue in the 2015 Canadian federal election. In local candidate meetings only local Conservative candidates expressed support for building an airport on the lands, with the NDP, Liberal and Green candidates expressing opposition. =2018 municipal election issue= The future of the Pickering Airport Lands became an election issue in the 2018 Durham Region municipal elections. The Mayor of Pickering and the majority of the re-elected local city and regional council supported the development of a new airport. Mayor Ryan won by a landslide winning 66% of the vote Location The airport, as proposed in June 2013, would be located in the north-central part of Pickering, directly north-east of Toronto and about 65 km (40 mi) east of Toronto Pearson International Airport. The airport landing approach surfaces, as it is now zoned,Transport Canada will have aircraft flying a center line just north of Markham, just south of Stouffville onto runways 10L and 10R, west of Uxbridge, over part of Ajax onto runway 32 and over part of north Whitby onto runway 28R and 28L. The remnants of the hamlet of Altona and the village of Brougham are situated entirely within the expropriated area. The closest large communities are Claremont (an exurban village of around 2,800 residents, located northeast of the airport lands in Pickering), Stouffville and Markham. A significant fifteenth-century Huron ancestral village on the airport site (the Draper Site) was completely excavated in 1975 and 1978 in anticipation of the airport's construction.

Written in 1930, the Broadway musical. Fine and Dandy includes some of her best known songs; the song Fine and Dandy has become a jazz standard. \\"Can't We Be Friends?\\" (1929) was her biggest hit song. Swift also arranged some of the music of George Gershwin posthumously, such as the prelude \\"Sleepless Night\\" (1946). Biography Katharine Faulkner Swift was born to English American Samuel Shippen Swift, a music critic, and Ellen Faulkner of England in New York City.Weber, p. 146 Her father died when she was young. Swift was educated at the Veltin School for Girls and then trained as a classical musician and composer at the Institute of Musical Art, now known as the Juilliard School. Her teacher of composition was Charles Martin Loeffler, while harmony and composition were taught to her by Percy Goetschius. Swift played professionally with the Edith Rubel Trio. While performing at a social event, she met the sister of her future husband, who arranged their meeting. James Paul \\"Jimmy\\" Warburg was a banker, member of a distinguished Jewish family who had made a fortune in banking. Swift was Christian, and Warburg's parents had accepted their marriage, but an uncle by marriage Jacob Schiff objected to it. Warburg--using the pen name of Paul James--wrote lyrics for Swift's melodies, an extension of his poetry writing which was a family tradition. Swift had three children by Warburg between 1919 and 1924.Hyland: p. 89 She was grandmother to the novelist Katharine Weber. Before meeting George Gershwin in 1925, her musical background was classical, though she was a great fan of the songs of Irving Berlin. Gershwin--who had coined her nickname \\"Kay\\"--Ohl: p. 51 encouraged her interest in popular music and her writing in that vein. He frequently consulted Swift about his musicals and other works, and she became a trusted musical advisor.Hyland, ibid: p. 90 After she met George Gershwin, he and Swift were more and more frequently seen together. Her husband Jimmy, frequently out of town on business, was tolerant, later saying that he liked Gershwin although he had some resentment toward the \\"self-centered genius\\" who had interfered with his life. Swift and Warburg's marriage ended in divorce in 1934. Gershwin and Swift's affair lasted over ten years in all, until his death in 1937. Despite their long relationship, Kay and George never married, perhaps because, as her granddaughter Katharine Weber has suggested, Gershwin's mother Rose was unhappy that she was not Jewish. In any case, his reluctance was not unfamiliar to his family and friends--Ira Gershwin thought George was too uncomfortable with children, others thought he was too self-centered to ever marry or simply preferred not to. As the couple entered a nightclub one evening, Oscar Levant reportedly announced, \\"Ah, look! Here comes George Gershwin with the future Miss Kay Swift.\\"Ohl:p. 117 Before their 1930 hit show Fine and Dandy, Kay Swift and Paul James contributed numbers to The First Little Show (\\"Can't We Be Friends?\\") and The Garrick Gaieties. In 1934 Swift composed a ballet for George Balanchine entitled Alma Mater, which marked Balanchine's first original work with an American setting. After Gershwin's death in 1937, Ira Gershwin collaborated with Swift to complete and arrange some of his unpublished works.Hyland, ibid: p. 90 He said that she knew almost all of George's music, \\"had taken down sketches as he composed [...] and had total musical recall.\\"Ohl: p. 126 Swift was staff composer at Radio City Music Hall where she wrote musical numbers for The Rockettes, and was Director of Light Music for the 1939 World's Fair. Swift met a cowboy at a rodeo in 1939, and eloped with him two weeks later. Her 1943 book about life on his Oregon ranch, \\"Who Could Ask For Anything More?\\" was made into the 1950 movie Never a Dull Moment, which featured Fred MacMurray as the cowboy and Irene Dunne as Kay. In 1952, Kay Swift provided the score for Cornelia Otis Skinner's one-woman Broadway show Paris '90. Her later years were devoted to transcribing, performing, and annotating Gershwin's music, which she did until being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1991. On January 28, 1993, she died at the Alzheimer's Resource Center in Southington, Connecticut at the age of 95. References Notes External links * KaySwift.com * Kay Swift Papers at Irving S.

Nicola Vicentino (1511 - 1575 or 1576) was an Italian music theorist and composer of the Renaissance. He was one of the most visionary musicians of the age, inventing, among other things, a microtonal keyboard. Life Little is known of his early life. Born in Vicenza, he may have studied with Adrian Willaert in Venice, which was close by, and he acquired an early interest in the contemporary humanistic revival, including the study of ancient Greek music theory and performance practice (about which little was known, but was then being uncovered, through the work of scholars such as Girolamo Mei and Giangiorgio Trissino). At some time in the 1530s or early 1540s he went to Ferrara, which was to become the center for experimental secular music in Italy from the middle to the end of the 16th century. Apparently he served as a music tutor to the Duke of Este as well as some of his family members, and some of Vicentino's music was sung at the court of Ferrara. During the late 1540s his reputation as a music theorist grew. He established his reputation as a composer with his publication of a book of madrigals in Venice in 1546, and in 1551 he took part in one of the most famous events in 16th century music theory, the debate between Vicente Lusitano and himself in Rome in 1551. The topic of the debate was the relationship of the ancient Greek genera to contemporary music practice, in particular whether contemporary music could be explained in terms of the diatonic genus alone (as Lusitano claimed) or (as Vicentino claimed) was best described as a combination of the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera, the last of which contained a microtone. The debate was rather unlike those among contemporary musicologists, being more like a refereed prize fight, with a panel of judges; they awarded the prize to Lusitano. Unbowed, Vicentino continued his experiments, and went on to build the archicembalo which could play the music he described in his publications. Only one keyboard instrument using his 31-note-to-the-octave system survives from the Renaissance: the ‚ÄòClavemusicum Omnitonum Modulis Diatonicis Cromaticis et Enearmonicis', built by Vito Trasuntino of Venice in 1606 to play the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic. It is on display at the International museum and library of music in Bologna. After a short time in Rome, Vicentino returned to Ferrara, and later moved to Siena. In 1563 he became maestro di cappella at Vicenza Cathedral, thus returning to his home city, but only briefly, for he accepted a position in Milan in 1565. Around 1570 he had some connection with the Bavarian court in Munich, though he may never have gone there. He died in Milan during the plague of 1575-1576, though his exact date of death is not known. Works Cathedral of Ferrara. Ferrara was the principal center of chromatic experimentation in the second half of the 16th century. While Vicentino was known as a composer, and wrote two books of madrigals and motets in a harmonically sophisticated style, it was his work as a music theorist that gained him renown. In the 1550s, in Italy, there was a surge of interest in chromatic composition, some of which was part of the movement known as musica reservata, and some of which was motivated by research into ancient Greek music, including modes and genera. Composers such as Cipriano de Rore, Orlande de Lassus and others wrote music which was impossible to sing in tune without having a system for adjusting the pitch of chromatic intervals in some way. Several theorists attacked the problem, including Vicentino. In 1555 he published his most famous work, L'antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica (ancient music adapted to modern practice), in which he fully explained his ideas linking ancient Greek musical theory and practice with contemporary works. In this work he expanded and justified many of the ideas which he first brought up in his debate with Lusitano. Whether or not Lusitano ever attempted to refute Vicentino's expanded version is not known; however, Vicentino's book was influential with the group of madrigalists working in Ferrara in the next two decades, including Luzzasco Luzzaschi and Carlo Gesualdo. Another area in which Vicentino did original work was musical dynamics. He was one of the first theorists, and perhaps the first, to mention volume as an expressive parameter. In L'antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica he mentioned that the strength of singing must respect carefully the text and passage being sung. Vicentino's most famous invention was the archicembalo, a keyboard containing thirty-one keys to the octave. Using this keyboard, it was possible to play acoustically satisfactory intervals in any key, and therefore some of the recently composed music in a chromatic style, which was only in tune when sung, could be played on the keyboard. Later he applied the same keyboard layout to the arciorgano, a microtonal keyboard for the organ.He described it briefly in a handbill named Descrizione dell'arciograno, published in Venice in 1561. This advertisement paper has been reproduced and translated in the book: Henry W. Kaufmann. The Life and Works of Nicola Vicentino. (s.l.), American Institute of Musicology, 1966, p.172. While these keyboards did not achieve wide popularity, they did offer a way of playing music in meantone temperament in all keys. The standard way to modulate through all keys on a keyboard instrument later became to divide the octave into twelve equal parts, called 12-tone equal temperament, in which the major and minor thirds are not well tuned. Vicentino's solution in effect divides the octave into 31 equal parts, with good intonation for the thirds and sixths but somewhat beating narrow fifths.

Education and appointments Brian Morris grew up in Adelaide, South Australia, where he graduated from the University of Adelaide in 1972. He then completed his PhD at Monash University and the University of Melbourne in 1975. From 1975‚Äì1978 he did postdoctoral research at the University of Missouri, and the University of California, San Francisco, first as a CJ Martin fellow, and then as an Advanced Fellow of the American Heart Association. He was then appointed as an academic at the University of Sydney in 1978, was appointed a professor in 1999, and was appointed Professor Emeritus in 2013. He retired in 2014 and the Bosch Institute of Medical Research took over his lab space. Career Morris studied the Renin‚Äìangiotensin system (RAS) for most of his career. His interest in RAS began during his undergraduate studies, when he worked for a while in the laboratory where Eugenie Lumbers had just found early clues to the existence of prorenin (the protein precursor of renin) during her PhD work. He remained interested in the field, and had the good fortune to move to the University of California, San Francisco in the mid-1970s, a center for the development of the tools of biotechnology and molecular cloning. He joined others in applying those tools to RAS, and was among the pioneers is isolating the gene for renin itself, along with the prorenin and kallikrein genes, and the cardiac myosin heavy chain gene. He and his team were among first to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of renin, as well as key molecular mechanisms in renin's transcriptional and posttranscriptional control. Taking that work further, he helped pioneer the field of genetic variation in hypertension. Morris has been active in the public debate around circumcision. He has described medical organisations, such as the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, who are not in favour of routine non-therapeutic circumcision, as like anti-vaccine advocates. He has, however, also remarked that parents should \\"weigh up all of the pros and cons for themselves and make their own best decision\\". In the 2000s, he began to study the genetics of longevity, including the roles of FOXO3 and the sirtuins. Awards and honours He was awarded the Royal Society of New South Wales' Edgeworth David Medal in 1985 and in 1993 the University of Sydney awarded him a DSc. In 2003 he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the American Heart Association Council for High Blood Pressure Research. In 2010 he gave the Lewis K. Dahl Memorial lecture, an award sponsored by the Council for High Blood Pressure Research in association with the American Heart Association. In 2014 the AHA awarded him the Irvine Page‚ÄîAlva Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the Queens Birthday Honours Awards in 2018.

Vanity Fair by Spy Life He was born in Selby, Yorkshire, of Quaker parents and educated in the local school. Then he was apprenticed for five years to Caleb Williams, an apothecary and surgeon in York. He entered St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, and became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1850 (and a fellow in 1862), and rapidly gained reputation as a skillful operator and a scientific inquirer. While a student, Hutchinson choose a career in surgery from 1854 on, under the influence and help of his mentor, Sir James Paget (1814‚Äì99). In 1851, he studied ophthalmology at Moorfields and practised it at London Ophthalmic Hospital. Other hospitals where he practised in the following years were the Lock Hospital, the City of London Chest Hospital, the London Hospital, the Metropolitan Hospitals, and the Blackfriars Hospital for Diseases of the Skin. His intense activity in so many medical specialties reflected also in his involvement with several medical societies. He was president of the Hunterian Society in 1869 and 1870, professor of surgery and pathology at the Royal College of Surgeons from 1877 to 1882, president of the Pathological Society (1879‚Äì80), of the Ophthalmological Society (1883), of the Neurological Society (1887) of the Medical Society (1890), and of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society from 1894 to 1896. In 1889, he was president of the Royal College of Surgeons. He was a member of two royal commissions, that of 1881 to inquire into the provision for smallpox and fever cases in the London hospitals, and that of 1889‚Äì96 on vaccination and leprosy. He also acted as honorary secretary to the Sydenham Society. In June 1882 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was the first orator at the York Medical Society. Hutchinson is considered the father of oral medicine by some. Works Hutchinson's activity in the cause of scientific surgery and in advancing the study of the natural sciences was unwearying. He published more than 1,200 medical articles and also produced the quarterly Archives of Surgery from 1890 to 1900, being its only contributor. His lectures on neuropathogenesis, gout, leprosy, diseases of the tongue, etc., were full of original observation; but his principal work was connected with the study of syphilis, on which he became the first living authority. He was the first to describe his triad of medical signs for congenital syphilis: notched incisor teeth, labyrinthine deafness, and interstitial keratitis, which was very useful for providing a firm diagnosis long before Treponema pallidum or the Wassermann test were discovered. By contrast, his insistence that leprosy was caused by eating decaying fish was incorrect. He was the founder of the Medical Graduates‚Äô College and Polyclinic; and both in his native town of Selby and at Haslemere, Surrey, he started (about 1890) educational museums for popular instruction in natural history. He published several volumes on his own subjects and was given an Hon. LL.D degree by both the University of Glasgow and University of Cambridge. He received a knighthood in 1908.

To capture data, a transducer is employed which converts the actual image or a sound into a digital file. The file is then stored and at a later time it can be analyzed by a computer, or compared with other files in a database to verify identity or to provide authorization to enter a secured system. Capturing of data can be done in various ways; the best method depends on application. In biometric security systems, capture is the acquisition of or the process of acquiring and identifying characteristics such as finger image, palm image, facial image, iris print or voice print which involves audio data and the rest all involves video data. Radio- frequency identification is relatively a new AIDC technology which was first developed in 1980s. The technology acts as a base in automated data collection, identification and analysis systems worldwide. RFID has found its importance in a wide range of markets, including livestock identification and Automated Vehicle Identification (AVI) systems because of its capability to track moving objects. These automated wireless AIDC systems are effective in manufacturing environments where barcode labels could not survive. Overview of automatic identification methods  Nearly all of the automatic identification technologies consist of three principal components, which also comprise the sequential steps in AIDC- 1 Data encoder . A code is a set of symbols or signals that usually represent alphanumeric characters. When data are encoded, the characters are translated into a machine readable code. A label or tag containing the encoded data is attached to the item that is to be identified. 2 Machine reader or scanner. This device reads the encoded data, converting them to alternative form, usually an electrical analog signal. 3 Data decoder. This component transforms the electrical signal into digital data and finally back into the original alphanumeric characters. Capturing data from printed documents One of the most useful application tasks of data capture is collecting information from paper documents and saving it into databases (CMS, ECM and other systems). There are several types of basic technologies used for data capture according to the data type: *OCR ‚Äì for printed text recognition *ICR ‚Äì for hand-printed text recognition *OMR ‚Äì for marks recognitionPalmer, Roger C. (1989, Sept) The Basics of Automatic Identification [Electronic version]. Canadian Datasystems, 21 (9), 30-33 *OBR ‚Äì for barcodes recognition *BCR ‚Äì for bar code recognition *DLR - for document layer recognition These basic technologies allow extracting information from paper documents for further processing it in the enterprise information systems such as ERP, CRM and others. The documents for data capture can be divided into 3 groups: structured, semi-structured and unstructured. Structured documents (questionnaires, tests, insurance forms, tax returns, ballots, etc.) have completely the same structure and appearance. It is the easiest type for data capture, because every data field is located at the same place for all documents. Semi-structured documents (invoices, purchase orders, waybills, etc.) have the same structure but their appearance depends on number of items and other parameters. Capturing data from these documents is a complex, but solvable task. Unstructured documents (letters, contracts, articles, etc.) could be flexible with structure and appearance. The Internet and the future The idea is as simple as its application is difficult. If all cans, books, shoes or parts of cars are equipped with minuscule identifying devices, daily life on our planet will undergo a transformation. Things like running out of stock or wasted products will no longer exist as we will know exactly what is being consumed on the other side of the globe. Theft will be a thing of the past as we will know where a product is at all times. Counterfeiting of critical or costly items such as drugs, repair parts, or electronic components will be reduced or eliminated because manufacturers or other supply chain entities will know where their products are at all times. Product wastage or spoilage will be reduced because environmental sensors will alert suppliers or consumers when sensitive products are exposed to excessive heat, cold, vibration, or other risks. Supply chains will operate far more efficiently because suppliers will ship only the products needed when and where they are needed. Consumer and supplier prices should also drop accordingly. The global association Auto-ID Labs was founded in 1999 and is made up of 100 of the largest companies in the world such as Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola, Gillette, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, UPS, companies working in the sector of technology such as SAP, Alien, Sun as well as five academic research centers. These are based at the following Universities; MIT in the USA, Cambridge University in the UK, the University of Adelaide in Australia, Keio University in Japan and ETH Zurich as well as the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. The Auto-ID Labs suggests a concept of a future supply chain that is based on the Internet of objects, i.e. a global application of RFID. They try to harmonize technology, processes and organization. Research is focused on miniaturization (aiming for a size of 0.3 mm/chip), reduction in the price per single device (aiming at around $0.05 per unit), the development of innovative application such as payment without any physical contact (Sony/Philips), domotics (clothes equipped with radio tags and intelligent washing machines), and sporting events (timing at the Berlin marathon). AIDC 100 AIDC 100 is a professional organization for the automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) industry. This group is composed of individuals who made substantial contributions to the advancement of the industry. Increasing business's understanding of AIDC processes and technologies are the primary goals of the organization.

It is located at 85 Albert Embankment in Vauxhall, a south western part of central London, on the bank of the River Thames beside Vauxhall Bridge. The building has been the headquarters of the SIS since 1994. History =Background= The SIS had previously been based at Century House, a 22-storey office block on Westminster Bridge Road, Lambeth, near Lambeth North and Waterloo stations. The location of the headquarters was classified information, though The Daily Telegraph reported that it was \\"London's worst-kept secret, known only to every taxi driver, tourist guide and KGB agent\\". Century House was described as \\"irredeemably insecure\\" in a 1985 National Audit Office (NAO) report with security concerns raised in a survey; the building was made largely of glass, and had a petrol station at its base. Security concerns combined with the remaining short leasehold and cost of modernising the building were important factors in moving to a new headquarters. =Design and construction= The site on which the SIS building stands had been the location of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in the 19th century. Several industrial buildings were subsequently built on the site after the demolition of the pleasure gardens in the 1850s, including a glass factory, a vinegar works and a gin distillery. Archeological excavation of the site during building found the remains of 17th-century glass kilns, as well as barge houses and an inn called The Vine. Evidence was also found for a river wall on the site. In 1983 the site was bought by property developers Regalian Properties. A competition to develop the site was won by architect Terry Farrell, with an urban village as Farrell's original proposal. A scheme of office blocks was subsequently developed for the site, with a government agency as their occupier. The building had been sold for ¬£130 million in 1989, with construction planned to take three years, built by John Laing. SIS ultimately became the occupiers of the building. Farrell's design for the building was influenced by 1930s industrial modernist architecture such as Bankside and Battersea Power Stations and Mayan and Aztec religious temples.

In 1988 Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher approved the purchase of the new building for the SIS. The NAO put the final cost at ¬£135.05 million for site purchase and the basic building or ¬£152.6 million including the service's special requirements. The site is rumoured to include a tunnel under the Thames from the building to Whitehall. The numerous layers over which the building is laid out create 60 separate roof areas. 25 different types of glass were used in the building, with of glass and aluminium used in the building's construction. The windows in the SIS building are triple glazed for security purposes. Due to the sensitive nature of MI6's work, large parts of the building are below street level, with numerous underground corridors serving the building.Mark Henderson. \\"Heavy security at ¬£75m building.\\" The Times, London, 21 September 2000 Amenities for staff include a sports hall, gymnasium, aerobics studio, a squash court and a restaurant.Francis Wheen. \\"MI6's big secret: they're useless.\\", The Guardian, 3 September, pg. 1 The building also features two moats for protection. The building was completed in April 1994 and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in July of that year.\\"Queen visits Mi6.\\", The Times, London, 15 July 1994, pg 2 =Recent history= In September 2000, the building was attacked by unapprehended forces using a Russian-built RPG-22 anti-tank rocket, causing superficial damage. The Metropolitan Police recovered the discarded rocket launcher at Spring Gardens park in Vauxhall, as well as finding remains of the rocket which had exploded against an eighth floor window. Dissident Irish Republicans were believed to have been behind the attack. Writing in The Daily Telegraph after the attack, journalist Alan Judd referred to detractors who wished a less visible physical presence for SIS; writing that \\"Both sides of the Whitehall debate might now claim vindication by the rocket attack: on the one hand, the building's profile made it an obvious target; on the other, a headquarters with expensive security protection has been shown to be necessary.\\" On 1 June 2007, the building and its curtilage were designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The effect of the act was to make it a specific criminal offence for a person to trespass onto the site. In August 2010, two men from North Wales were arrested after a parcel bomb was found at the SIS building's postal handling centre. The Queen visited Vauxhall Cross for a second time in February 2006,\\"Court Circular\\", The Times, London, 11 February 2006, pg. 78 and Charles, Prince of Wales visited in July 2008.\\"Court Circular\\", The Times, London, 9 July 2008, pg. 55. In June 2013, Prince Harry visited Vauxhall Cross and was given a briefing on intelligence by staff. During the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, part of the celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2012, the London Philharmonic Orchestra played the \\"James Bond Theme\\" as they passed the building. The Daily Telegraph wrote that \\"Even MI6 managed to join the party ‚Äì just. Its headquarters at Vauxhall sported a few discreet rows of bunting. But its balconies remained empty.\\" The building was lit with pink lights to raise awareness of breast cancer in 2013. In January 2013, the building was briefly put into a state of alert after the Vauxhall helicopter crash. Cultural influence =Architectural criticism= The SIS building was reviewed favourably by Deyan Sudjic in The Guardian in 1992; he described it as an \\"epitaph for the architecture of the eighties\\". Sudjic wrote that \\"It's a design which combines high seriousness in its classical composition with a possible unwitting sense of humour. The building could be interpreted equally plausibly as a Mayan temple or a piece of clanking art deco machinery\\", and added that the most impressive thing about Farrell's design was the way he had not \\"confined himself to a single idea\\" as the building \\"grows and develops as you move around it\\". In their 2014 Guide to London's Contemporary Architecture, Kenneth Allinson and Victoria Thornton wrote: Feargus O'Sullivan on the other hand mentioned the nickname \\"Ceau»ôescu Towers\\" for the building, referring to the oversized pompous architecture of Socialist Romania, and derided the whole neighbourhood of newly constructed buildings in Vauxhall as \\"Dubai-on-Thames\\". =James Bond films= Vauxhall Cross has featured in several recent James Bond films. The building was first featured in GoldenEye in 1995 and was depicted as having been attacked in The World Is Not Enough (1999), Skyfall (2012), and Spectre (2015). For Skyfall a model of the building was constructed at Pinewood Studios. A special premiere of Skyfall was held at Vauxhall Cross for MI6 staff, who cheered when their headquarters was destroyed in the film. Filming for the 24th Bond film, Spectre, took place on the Thames near Vauxhall Cross in May 2015.

It is situated on the western end of Long Island Sound, along the sound's northwestern shore, and is part of Pelham Bay Park in the northeastern part of the Bronx. Hunter Island initially covered and was one of the Pelham Islands, the historical name for a group of islands in western Long Island Sound that once belonged to Thomas Pell. The island is connected to another former island, Twin Island, on the northeast. The area around Hunter Island was originally settled by the Siwanoy Native Americans. One of Pell's descendants, Joshua Pell, moved onto the island in 1743. It was subsequently owned by the Hunter and Henderson families, and the island was briefly named Henderson's Island after the latter. Henderson's Island was purchased by politician John Hunter in 1804. Hunter built a mansion on the island and his family resided on the island until 1865, when it was sold to former mayor Ambrose Kingsland. Hunter Island was owned by several other people before being incorporated into Pelham Bay Park in 1888. Subsequently, the island became a vacation destination. In the 1930s, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses extended nearby Orchard Beach, to the south of the island, by connecting Hunter Island to the mainland. Hunter Island formerly contained Hunter Mansion, which Hunter had built for his family in 1811. It was located on the island's highest point and was destroyed in 1937 when Orchard Beach was expanded onto the island. A causeway connecting Hunter Island to the mainland still exists. Today the former island is part of a wildlife refuge, the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary, which was established in 1967 on the northern shores of Hunter and Twin Islands. The sanctuary includes rock outcroppings and an intertidal marine ecosystem that is not found anywhere else in New York state. Hunter Island also contains the Kazimiroff Nature Trail and Orchard Beach Environmental Center, which was established in 1986 as a tribute to Bronx preservationist Theodore Kazimiroff.  Geography  Hunter Island is located within the northeastern part of Pelham Bay Park, which is itself located in the northeast Bronx, near New York City's northern border. The island's flora largely consists of tracts of old-growth forest that existed prior to the settlement of the New York City area, as well as plants introduced by John Hunter in the 19th century. A 2005 survey by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) found 49 native species as well as four invasive species. Some of the plants found on Hunter Island, including lousewort, alum root, and broad beech fern are seldom found in other New York City parks. The island contains the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary, established in 1967, and the Kazimiroff Nature Trail and Orchard Beach Environmental Center, which opened in 1986. To the north and west of the former island is LeRoy's Bay, a lagoon nearby that separated Hunter Island from the mainland. The bay was traversed by a stone causeway to Hunter Island. Most of the lagoon was filled in during the mid-1930s reconstruction of Orchard Beach, and the bay became known as the \\"Orchard Beach Lagoon\\", or the Lagoon for short. To the north of Hunter Island is Glen Island Park, outside the city limits in Westchester County. It is separated from Hunter Island via LeRoy's Bay. Glen Island Park is operated by Westchester County, and parking and beach access are open only to Westchester residents. The eastern part of Hunter Island is adjacent to Hog Island and Cat Briar Island, two tiny islands in Pelham Bay. Hunter Island is also physically attached to Twin Island on the southeast corner. Twin Island was itself formerly two islands called East and West Twin Islands; the westernmost island was connected to Hunter Island via a man-made stone bridge, which now lies in ruins in one of the city's last remaining salt marshes. Twin Island is in turn attached to another former island called Two Trees Island. Twin and Two Trees Islands are now connected to Hunter Island and the mainland by landfill. All six landmasses form part of the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary. To the south is Orchard Beach and Pelham Bay. Orchard Beach surrounds the bay on its east in a roughly crescent shape, and the northern part of the beach connects Hunter and Twin Islands. The bay formerly adjoined the southern part of Hunter Island, but approximately one third of the original bay was filled in to create Orchard Beach from 1934 to 1938. Orchard Beach's parking lot is located on the southeast side of Hunter Island. History The Siwanoy Native Americans who originally occupied the area referred to the general vicinity around Hunter Island as \\"Laap-Ha-Wach King\\", or \\"place of stringing beads\\". One notable boulder, the \\"Gray Mare\\" at the northwestern shore of the island, is a glacial erratic where the Siwanoy would conduct ceremonies. Another boulder was the \\"Mishow\\", another important ceremonial site for the Siwanoy, as well as the burial sites of two sachems. Fishing was once conducted on Hunter Island's eastern shore (though not necessarily by the Siwanoy), and on some days, fishermen netted over a thousand pounds of fish. Sources indicate Wampage II, Siwanoy sachem and son of Wampage I, had a stockaded \\"castle\\" on Hunter Island in the late 17th century.. The earliest building to be built on the island was the Old Stone House, a small outbuilding that was believed to have been built by an unknown Huguenot prior to 1700. What was later known as Hunter Island was originally part of the Pell estate, and Joshua Pell, a descendant of Thomas Pell, took ownership of the island in 1743. According to a newspaper article from 1933, the Old Stone House was the Pells' residence. The island was subsequently owned by the Hunter and Henderson families. The island was briefly called Henderson's Island after Alexander Henderson, the third owner of the island. Upon Henderson's death in 1804, the island was offered for lease. John Hunter, a successful businessman and politician, purchased the property shortly afterward. Hunter, his wife Elizabeth, and his son Elias moved to the island in 1813. The Hunters built their own mansion on the island. The Old Stone House, which by then adjoined the mansion, was used as a barn. John Hunter lived on the estate until his death in 1852. Ownership of the mansion then passed to Elias Hunter. Upon Elias's death in 1865, his son John III was supposed to inherit the land only if he lived on it, as per the senior John Hunter's will. John III, who lived in Throggs Neck instead, sold it to Mayor Ambrose Kingsland in 1866. The land then passed in succession to Alvin Higgins, Gardiner Jorden, and Oliver Iselin. The city then bought the land in 1889 for $324,000 (). In 1892, Stephen Peabody was given the right to occupy the Hunter Mansion, paying $1,200 a year in rent, in conjunction with his new role as groundskeeper of Hunter Island. Soon afterward, the mansion became a shelter for children operated by the Society of Little Mothers. The barn adjoining the mansion burned down in a fire in approximately 1890, and was abandoned by the early 20th century. By the early 1900s, Hunter Island had become a popular summer vacation destination, and it hosted a campsite. The Hunter House had been renovated into a hotel. In 1903, due to overcrowding on Hunter Island, NYC Parks opened another campsite at Rodman's Neck on the south tip of the island, with 100 bathhouses. By 1917, Hunter Island saw half a million seasonal visitors. The park's condition started to decline in the 1920s as the surrounding areas were developed. Hunter Island became popular with European immigrants who built shelters and established summer colonies. This led to the island being closed and camping banned, but was unsuccessful at preventing the beachgoers from returning. Upon taking office in 1934, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses surveyed every park in the city. Moses devised plans for a new Orchard Beach recreation area after he saw the popularity of the Hunter Island campsite. At the time, the beach was a narrow sand bar connecting Hunter Island and Rodman's Neck. Moses canceled 625 leases for the project, and after campers unsuccessfully sued the city, the site was cleared of campers in June. Moses decided to connect Hunter Island and the Twin Islands to Rodman's Neck by filling in most of LeRoy's Bay, a lagoon located to the west of the island. The deteriorated Hunter Mansion was demolished in 1937 with the construction of the beach. The expanded Orchard Beach was opened on June 25, 1937. In the 1960s, there were plans to expand a landfill in Pelham Bay Park, which would have created the City's second- largest refuse disposal site next to Fresh Kills in Staten Island. A group of preservationists headed by Dr. Theodore Kazimiroff, a Bronx historian and head of the Bronx Historical Society, lobbied the city to create a wildlife preserve in Hunter Island, one of the sites where the landfill was proposed to be expanded. The preservation effort suffered setbacks in August 1967 when the New York City Board of Estimate voted against an initial effort to create the protected area in the proposed landfill expansion site. On October 11, 1967, Mayor John Lindsay signed a law authorizing in the creation of two wildlife refuges in Pelham Bay Park: the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary on the western side of the park, and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary on the former Hunter Island. This was followed by the Kazimiroff Nature Trail and the Pelham Bay Park Environmental Center in 1986. The trail was named after the historian Kazimiroff, who had since died. Mansion Hunter Mansion In 1811, the Hunter family built a mansion in the English Georgian style. It was described as one of the finest mansions of the period, with three stories, a large veranda, and terraced gardens leading to the island's shore. The building had a rectangular shape. The main entrance faced west, toward the mainland, and contained a grand doorway flanked by columns. A portico at the back faced the Long Island Sound. The mansion held an art collection of over 400 works from artists such as Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, and Leonardo da Vinci. The home was situated at the highest point on the island, above sea level, and had views of Long Island Sound to the east and the hills and woodlands of the Town of Pelham to the north. At the time that the mansion existed, the remainder of the island was mostly lawns, except for a few outbuildings such as the former Old Stone House, as well as a tenant's house and a garden. The mansion was demolished in 1937 after a long period of deterioration. The stone causeway connected the island to the mainland. The entrance to the causeway from Eastern Boulevard (present-day Shore Road), on the mainland, was marked by two white granite gateposts. The Hunter's Island Inn, a mansion owned by Elias Hunter's daughter Elizabeth de Lancey, was located across from the gateposts. The causeway blocked the flow of water in LeRoy's Bay. The bridge's remnants still exist . Wildlife sanctuary Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary encompasses all of Twin Islands, Cat Briar Island, Two Trees Island, and the northeastern shoreline of Hunter Island. It contains many glacial erratics, large boulders that were deposited during the last glacial period. The rocky coast of Twin Islands contains the southernmost outcropping of Hartland schist, the major bedrock component of New England coastlines, as well as granite with both migmatite dikes and veins made of quartz. The sanctuary supports a unique intertidal marine ecosystem that is rare in New York State. It holds the largest continuous oak forest in Pelham Bay Park, including white, red, and black oak, as well as black cherry, white poplar, white pines, Norway spruce, and black locust trees. One can also find grape hyacinth, periwinkle, daylily, and Tartarian honeysuckle, which were part of the Hunter Mansion's garden. Member species of the islands' salt marsh ecosystem include egrets, cormorants, fiddler crabs, horseshoe crabs, marine worms, barnacles, and oysters. Kazimiroff Nature Trail In 1983, the Theodore Kazimiroff Environmental Center was proposed for the park, alongside a nature trail that would wind through the park's terrain. It would be named out of respect to the late Kazimiroff, who had died in 1980. The Kazimiroff Nature Trail, as well as the Pelham Bay Park Environmental Center at Orchard Beach, opened in June 1986. The Kazimiroff Nature Trail traverses of Hunter Island. Much of the island's natural features are found along the trail. The trail comprises two overlapping lasso-shaped paths, the \\"red\\" and \\"blue\\" trails. The blue trail is slightly longer than the red trail. Along the shared \\"lasso spur\\" is a canal for mosquito control as well as an intersection with the old Hunter Island causeway's cobblestone approach path. Going counterclockwise from the intersection with the two \\"loops\\", the trail passes through a grove of 100 Norway spruces planted in 1918; a black locust forest from the 1970s; and a thicket of shrubs and vines. At this point, the longer blue trail diverges to the northwest and then northeast, passing the former Hunter Mansion's knoll; a forest of white pines; some mugwort and invasive Ailanthus; the Hunter Mansion's main driveway; a less dense patch of trees and burnt tree stumps, part of a forest burned by the Siwanoy; white oaks and black locusts; and lichen-covered boulders, a rare occurrence in New York City parks. The shorter red trail goes directly north through a white poplar forest; a grove scorched by an uncontrolled fire; and remnants of the former estates' stone walls. Both trails merge and loop back to the east and south, passing through glacial-erratic boulders, New England bedrock, and the island's salt marsh. The Gray Mare glacial erratic can also be seen along this stretch.

They were twin-engined locomotives, combining two diesel engines. Configuration The U50 rode on four two-axle trucks, grouped in pairs linked by span bolsters, giving a wheel arrangement of B+B-B+B. The trucks and bolsters were re-used from scrapped UP turbine locomotives built by GE during the 1950s. The U50 was built in response to the Union Pacific Railroad's requirement, issued in the early 1960s, for a 3-unit locomotive intended to replace the turbines. The design was effectively two U25B locomotives on a single frame; each diesel engine and generator powered only the two trucks at the same end. Three were delivered to the UP in October 1963, and three to the Southern Pacific Railroad in May and June 1964. Other locomotives built to this requirement were the EMD DD35A and the ALCO Century 855. The Southern Pacific kept the three but did not order any more. They were kept on the roster until the late 1970s, but were often sidelined. While the UP's units were nicknamed \\"U-Boats\\", The SP's units gained the nickname \\"Baby Hueys\\" from the cartoon character of the same name. Original numbers were #8500-8502; they were later renumbered #9550-9552 and renumbered again to #9950-9952. Southern Pacific's three units differed from the Union Pacific U50s by having a cab door and headlights in the hood beneath the front windows. The Union Pacific was more satisfied with their three, and ordered 20 more. A batch of 12 were delivered between July and September 1964, while a final eight were built May through August 1965. They were numbered #31-53. UP #52 was delivered with a Cummins PT fuel system and rated at 5600 horsepower. The #52 had a standard fuel system installed in October 1966 and was rerated to 5000 horsepower. Twenty of the Union Pacific U50s were withdrawn from service in 1973 and 1974 and traded-in to GE for U30Cs. The last three Union Pacific units remained on the roster until April 1977. The Southern Pacific's three survived in service until 1977. All of the Union Pacific \\"U-Boats\\" & Southern Pacific \\"Baby Hueys\\" were sold for scrap by 1977. The U50 is sometimes inaccurately referred to as the U50D, a back-formation from the U50C name given to the six-axle units.

Tapeworm never released any recordings, but was frequently referenced in interviews. The band started as a side-project between Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and live-band members Danny Lohner and Charlie Clouser. Through the years the group expanded and evolved numerous times to include artists such as Maynard James Keenan, Atticus Ross, and Alan Moulder, effectively turning the project into a supergroup. After many years of rumors and expected release dates, Reznor announced the end of the project in 2004. History Tapeworm's genesis occurred during Nine Inch Nails recording sessions following The Downward Spiral tours circa 1996. While working on Nine Inch Nails material, Danny Lohner and Charlie Clouser, both Nine Inch Nails live band members, would often come up with ideas that Reznor felt did not fit in with his vision for the band. Tapeworm developed as an outlet for this material‚Äîa democratic group in which Lohner and Clouser could act as equals with Reznor, as opposed to Nine Inch Nails, in which Reznor maintained sole artistic control. As time went on, Tapeworm evolved into a supergroup, with guest musicians such as Maynard James Keenan, Page Hamilton, and Phil Anselmo recording material ostensibly to be used by the group. In 1999 Lohner reported that three tracks had been completed, and described the various materials featuring Anselmo as \\"heavy NIN-meets-Pantera\\" and \\"mellow Pink Floyd The Wall-type songs\\", and the material featuring Keenan as \\"psychedelic, groove-oriented verses and anthemic choruses.\\" Tommy Victor recorded material with the band as well, and later told Rolling Stone that the continued delays on Tapeworm contributed to his decision to take a hiatus from music, as well as accusing Reznor of giving his Tapeworm guitar contribution to Marilyn Manson. In a statement issued to MTV News, Reznor reflected on his collaborations with Keenan: By 2001, long-time Nine Inch Nails collaborator Alan Moulder had tracked \\"more than an album's worth\\" of demos. Moulder further described the rough tracks as \\"very unlike The Fragile\\" and were a deviation from most Nine Inch Nails material. By 2002, Clouser had left Nine Inch Nails and was no longer associated with Tapeworm. The group, which now consisted of Reznor, Lohner, Keenan, and Atticus Ross, booked time in a recording studio in hopes of producing an album. An official website, tapeworm.net (now offline), was created to showcase pictures from various recording sessions, including images of Josh Freese behind a drum kit. In September 2003, Lohner told Kerrang! magazine that the album was \\"ready to mix\\" but had been held up by legal issues stemming from conflicts between Reznor and Keenan's record labels. The Tapeworm material was reported numerous times as completion neared, most notably by MTV News and Kerrang!, and was slated to be released on Reznor's Nothing Records label. Initial recording sessions for the band were staged in the Nothing Studios in New Orleans, though were later reported as being moved to Southern Tracks Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2004, Reznor announced that Tapeworm was \\"dead for the foreseeable future\\", citing label issues, Keenan's A Perfect Circle obligations, and Reznor's own waning enthusiasm for the project. Reznor summarized the project's demise by saying \\"the bottom line is this: if the music had been great, all of this probably could have been worked out.\\" During an interview with digg founder Kevin Rose in 2009, Reznor further commented that he thought the material was not as good as could have been given his and Keenan's respective backgrounds and it was unlikely that the material would ever surface, but went on to say that he would like for the two of them to work together again at some point in the future. Contributors Musicians who have been cited as recording material for Tapeworm, in alphabetical order: *Phil Anselmo (Pantera, Down, Superjoint Ritual) *Charlie Clouser (Nine Inch Nails) *Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle, Devo, The Vandals, Nine Inch Nails, Guns N' Roses, Ashes Divide) *Toni Halliday (Curve) *Page Hamilton (Helmet) *Maynard James Keenan (Tool, A Perfect Circle, Puscifer) *Danny Lohner (Nine Inch Nails, A Perfect Circle, Black Light Burns, Skrew) *Alan Moulder (producer) *Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails, How to Destroy Angels) *Atticus Ross (12 Rounds, Error, How to Destroy Angels, Nine Inch Nails) *Tommy Victor (Prong, Danzig, Ministry) Songs Only two songs \\"Vacant\\" and \\"Potions\\", have ever been identified as Tapeworm songs. Neither have been released, though cover versions by Maynard James Keenan's other projects have surfaced. The first, \\"Vacant\\" was initially conceived during the Tapeworm sessions; the track being written by Lohner and re-arranged by Clouser, with lyrics and melody by Keenan and chorus and backing vocals by Reznor. The song was first performed live by A Perfect Circle throughout their 2001 tour. MTV reported that Reznor was apparently not happy that Keenan performed the song: \\"I have to admit I find it mildly irritating for \\"Vacant\\" to debut in this fashion before feeling it has been properly realized,\\" Shortly after the dissolution of the Tapeworm project, Keenan released a reworked version on A Perfect Circle's 2004 cover album Emotive under the title \\"Passive\\". Another side- project of Maynard James Keenan, Puscifer, released an album titled \\"C\\" Is for (Please Insert Sophomoric Genitalia Reference HERE) with a song, \\"Potions (Deliverance Mix),\\" which had writing credits given to Trent Reznor. In response to rumors that Keenan released a Tapeworm song without any changes made, a blog was posted on the home page of the main Puscifer website on November 18, 2009 saying that: Later Keenan delved further into the issue on his Twitter account only nine hours after the initial blog had been posted. Keenan essentially confirmed the song's origins in the Tapeworm project while also confirming that the song was covered and released by Puscifer in the same fashion as A Perfect Circle did with \\"Passive,\\" saying the following: References External links *nin.com ‚àí official Nine Inch Nails website *A Perfect Circle.com ‚Äì official A Perfect Circle website American rock music groups Supergroups (music) Musical groups established in 1995 Musical groups disestablished in 2004 ","title":"Tapeworm (band)"},{"id":"1375616","text":"Hannibal Sehested may refer to: *Hannibal Sehested (governor) (1609-1666), Danish statesman and Governor of Norway *Hannibal Sehested (council president) (1842-1924), Danish Council President ","title":"Hannibal Sehested"},{"id":"1375627","text":"G√™nes was a department of the French Consulate and of the First French Empire in present-day Italy.

It is situated in the Jewish village of Hara Seghira (currently known as er-Riadh), several kilometres southwest of Houmt El Souk, the main town of Djerba. The synagogue is the oldest in Tunisia, and besides being the center of the island's Jewish life is also a site of pilgrimage, one of the legends associated with its founding claims that either a stone or a door from Solomon's Temple or the Second Temple is incorporated in the building. History Inside the synagogue Djerba is home to around 1,300 Jews, and El Ghriba is an important feature of Jewish life on the island. According to legend, the construction of the synagogue goes back to the High Priests' escape following the destruction of Solomon's Temple by the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar II in the year 586 BCE (or, alternately, the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE). The High Priests carried with them a door and a stone of the destroyed Temple. Thus the synagogue links the Jewish diaspora to the \\"sole sanctuary of Judaism\\". In modern times, the local Jews are distinguished by their dress, which includes a black band around their pants, which signifies the destruction of the Temple. Another tradition says the synagogue was built on a spot where a young girl (ghriba, \\"the isolated one\\") had lived, that had not been accepted by the others. She died, and her uncorrupted body was found by the Jews of the nearby village, and then buried in a cave which became the site of an annual pilgrimage for Lag BaOmer. In 1985, during the festivities for Simchat Torah, a local policeman responsible for the synagogue‚Äòs safety opened fire into a crowd of celebrating Jews, killing three people, among them one child, and wounding 15.Chicago Tribune 09 Oct 1985, Page 11 \\"Shots kill 3 at Tunisia synagogue\\" On April 11, 2002, a truck full of explosives was detonated close to the synagogue, killing 21 people, among whom were 14 German tourists, five Tunisians and two French nationals. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the bombing, which was found to have been masterminded by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and financed by a Pakistani resident of Spain.  Location  Entrance of the synagogue The synagogue is located in the village of Erriadh, southwestward of Houmt Essouk on the Tunisian island of Djerba. The Ghriba is the most famous of the about 20 synagogues that were being used until the 1950s in the three Jewish villages on Djerba.  Buildings  Courtyard of El Ghriba The synagogue was built at the end of the 19th century at the spot where the 6th century building had been. On the outside, the current synagogue is a modest building, whereas the interior is richly decorated. In contrast to the other synagogues of Djerba, El Ghriba consists of two covered halls. Following several structural extensions the first of the two halls was built through the roofing of a formerly open courtyard in order to increase the capacity for the number of visitors. At the entrance, there are two columns dividing the room into three areas. This hall is connected to the main hall by three vaults. At this side there are two columns, supporting a high skylight of numerous windows. Initially there were twelve windows in the hall, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. During later renovations further windows were added. The north side also was modified. The Teva (the cupboard for the Torah) is located under the skylight (at the western side of the prayer room). A third column to the east is missing. It probably never got constructed. Local tradition sees that as a reminder of the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem. Furthermore it is said that the building should remain unfinished, because \\"nothing, except for the divinity, is perfect\\". The wooden benches for the believers are situated around the Teva. The inner walls are decorated ceramic tiles with blue, white and brown ornaments that were painted in hand work. A recess underneath the holy arc marks the spot where the body of the girl is supposed to have been found: It is known as ¬´the cave of the girl¬ª. The inner courtyard is surrounded by covered loggias standing on columns. Pilgrims can use the adjacent buildings for accommodation. The oldest of them were built at the end of the nineteenth century, whereas the newer ones stem from the early 1950s.

The administration committee organizes the annual pilgrimage and distributes the pilgrimage‚Äòs revenues to the village elders.  Pilgrimage  Lag Ba'Omer procession returning to the El Ghriba synagogue, 2007 People visiting El Ghriba The pilgrimage takes place every year on the 33rd day of the Counting of the Omer, in between Pesach and Shavuot.

By constantly monitoring phosphate nucleotide levels inside the cell, ADK plays an important role in cellular energy homeostasis. PDB image 3HPQ showing the ADK enzyme skeleton in cartoon and the key residues as sticks and labeled according to their placement in E. coli, crystallized with Ap5A inhibitor. Substrate and products The reaction catalyzed is: ATP + AMP ‚áî 2 ADP The equilibrium constant varies with condition, but it is close to 1.The NIST Thermodynamics of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions database, http://xpdb.nist.gov/enzyme_thermodynamics/enzyme1.pl, , gives equilibrium constants, search for adenylate kinase under enzymes Thus, ŒîGo for this reaction is close to zero. In muscle from a variety of species of vertebrates and invertebrates, the concentration of ATP is typically 7-10 times that of ADP, and usually greater than 100 times that of AMP. The rate of oxidative phosphorylation is controlled by the availability of ADP. Thus, the mitochondrion attempts to keep ATP levels high due to the combined action of adenylate kinase and the controls on oxidative phosphorylation.  Isozymes  To date there have been nine human ADK protein isoforms identified. While some of these are ubiquitous throughout the body, some are localized into specific tissues. For example, ADK7 and ADK8 are both only found in the cytosol of cells; and ADK7 is found in skeletal muscle whereas ADK8 is not. Not only do the locations of the various isoforms within the cell vary, but the binding of substrate to the enzyme and kinetics of the phosphoryl transfer are different as well. ADK1, the most abundant cytosolic ADK isozyme, has a Km about a thousand times higher than the Km of ADK7 and 8, indicating a much weaker binding of ADK1 to AMP. Sub-cellular localization of the ADK enzymes is done by including a targeting sequence in the protein. Each isoform also has different preference for NTP's. Some will only use ATP, whereas others will accept GTP, UTP, and CTP as the phosphoryl carrier. Some of these isoforms prefer other NTP's entirely. There is a mitochondrial GTP:AMP phosphotransferase, also specific for the phosphorylation of AMP, that can only use GTP or ITP as the phosphoryl donor. ADK has also been identified in different bacterial species and in yeast. Two further enzymes are known to be related to the ADK family, i.e. yeast uridine monophosphokinase and slime mold UMP-CMP kinase. Some residues are conserved across these isoforms, indicating how essential they are for catalysis. One of the most conserved areas includes an Arg residue, whose modification inactivates the enzyme, together with an Asp that resides in the catalytic cleft of the enzyme and participates in a salt bridge.  Subfamilies  * Adenylate kinase, subfamily * UMP-CMP kinase * Adenylate kinase, isozyme 1 Mechanism Phosphoryl transfer only occurs on closing of the 'open lid'. This causes an exclusion of water molecules that brings the substrates in proximity to each other, lowering the energy barrier for the nucleophilic attack by the Œ±-phosphoryl of AMP on the Œ≥-phosphoryl group of ATP resulting in formation of ADP by transfer of the Œ≥-phosphoryl group to AMP. In the crystal structure of the ADK enzyme from E. coli with inhibitor Ap5A, the Arg88 residue binds the Ap5A at the Œ±-phosphate group. It has been shown that the mutation R88G results in 99% loss of catalytic activity of this enzyme, suggesting that this residue is intimately involved in the phosphoryl transfer. Another highly conserved residue is Arg119, which lies in the adenosine binding region of the ADK, and acts to sandwich the adenine in the active site. It has been suggested that the promiscuity of these enzymes in accepting other NTP's is due to this relatively inconsequential interactions of the base in the ATP binding pocket. A network of positive, conserved residues (Lys13, Arg123, Arg156, and Arg167 in ADK from E. coli) stabilize the buildup of negative charge on phosphoryl group during the transfer. Two distal aspartate residues bind to the arginine network, causing the enzyme to fold and reduces its flexibility. A magnesium cofactor is also required, essential for increasing the electrophilicity of the phosphate on AMP, though this magnesium ion is only held in the active pocket by electrostatic interactions and dissociates easily. Structure thumb Residues of ADKE. coli involved in substrate binding Flexibility and plasticity allow proteins to bind to ligands, form oligomers, aggregate, and perform mechanical work. Large conformational changes in proteins play an important role in cellular signaling. Adenylate Kinase is a signal transducing protein; thus, the balance between conformations regulates protein activity. ADK has a locally unfolded state that becomes depopulated upon binding. Describes the generic kinetic cycle of the ADK enzyme family. Ternary complex is labeled.A 2007 study by Whitford et al. shows the conformations of ADK when binding with ATP or AMP. The study shows that there are three relevant conformations or structures of ADK‚ÄîCORE, Open, and Closed. In ADK, there are two small domains called the LID and NMP. ATP binds in the pocket formed by the LID and CORE domains. AMP binds in the pocket formed by the NMP and CORE domains. The Whitford study also reported findings that show that localized regions of a protein unfold during conformational transitions. This mechanism reduces the strain and enhances catalytic efficiency. Local unfolding is the result of competing strain energies in the protein. The local (thermodynamic) stability of the substrate-binding domains ATPlid and AMPlid has been shown to be significantly lower when compared with the CORE domain in ADKE. coli. Furthermore, it has been shown that the two subdomains (ATPlid and AMPlid) can fold and unfold in a \\"non-cooperative manner.\\" Binding of the substrates causes preference for 'closed' conformations amongst those that are sampled by ADK. These 'closed' conformations are hypothesized to help with removal of water from the active site to avoid wasteful hydrolysis of ATP in addition to helping optimize alignment of substrates for phosphoryl-transfer. Furthermore, it has been shown that the apoenzyme will still sample the 'closed' conformations of the ATPlid and AMPlid domains in the absence of substrates. When comparing the rate of opening of the enzyme (which allows for product release) and the rate of closing that accompanies substrate binding, closing was found to be the slower process.  Function  =Metabolic monitoring= The ability for a cell to dynamically measure energetic levels provides it with a method to monitor metabolic processes. By continually monitoring and altering the levels of ATP and the other adenyl phosphates (ADP and AMP levels) adenylate kinase is an important regulator of energy expenditure at the cellular level. As energy levels change under different metabolic stresses adenylate kinase is then able to generate AMP; which itself acts as a signaling molecule in further signaling cascades. This generated AMP can, for example, stimulate various AMP-dependent receptors such as those involved in glycolytic pathways, K-ATP channels, and 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Common factors that influence adenine nucleotide levels, and therefore ADK activity are exercise, stress, changes in hormone levels, and diet. It facilitates decoding of cellular information by catalyzing nucleotide exchange in the intimate ‚Äúsensing zone‚Äù of metabolic sensors. =ADK shuttle= Adenylate kinase is present in mitochondrial and myofibrillar compartments in the cell, and it makes two high-energy phosphoryls (Œ≤ and Œ≥) of ATP available to be transferred between adenine nucleotide molecules. In essence, adenylate kinase shuttles ATP to sites of high energy consumption and removes the AMP generated over the course of those reactions. These sequential phosphotransfer relays ultimately result in propagation of the phosphoryl groups along collections of ADK molecules. This process can be thought of as a bucket brigade of ADK molecules that results in changes in local intracellular metabolic flux without apparent global changes in metabolite concentrations. This process is extremely important for overall homeostasis of the cell. Disease relevance = Nucleoside diphosphate kinase deficiency = Nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase catalyzes in vivo ATP-dependent synthesis of ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. In mutated Escherichia coli that had a disrupted nucleoside diphosphate kinase, adenylate kinase performed dual enzymatic functions. ADK complements nucleoside diphosphate kinase deficiency. = Hemolytic anemia = Adenylate kinase deficiency in the erythrocyte is associated with hemolytic anemia. This is a rare hereditary erythroenzymopathy that, in some cases, is associated with mental retardation and psychomotor impairment. At least two patients have exhibited neonatal icterus and splenomegaly and required blood transfusions due to this deficiency. In another patient, an abnormal fragment with homozygous and heterozygous A-->G substitutions at codon 164 caused severe erythrocyte ADK deficiency. Two siblings had erythrocyte ADK deficiency, but one did not have evidence of hemolysis. = AK1 and post-ischemic coronary reflow = Knock out of AK1 disrupts the synchrony between inorganic phosphate and turnover at ATP- consuming sites and ATP synthesis sites. This reduces the energetic signal communication in the post-ischemic heart and precipitates inadequate coronary reflow flowing ischemia-reperfusion. = ADK2 deficiency = Adenylate Kinase 2 (AK2) deficiency in humans causes hematopoietic defects associated with sensorineural deafness. Recticular dysgenesis is an autosomal recessive form of human combined immunodeficiency. It is also characterized by an impaired lymphoid maturation and early differentiation arrest in the myeloid lineage. AK2 deficiency results in absent or a large decrease in the expression of proteins. AK2 is specifically expressed in the stria vascularis of the inner ear which indicates why individuals with an AK2 deficiency will have sensorineural deafness. = Structural adaptations = AK1 genetic ablation decreases tolerance to metabolic stress. AK1 deficiency induces fiber-type specific variation in groups of transcripts in glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism. This supports muscle energy metabolism. Plastidial ADK deficiency in Arabidopsis thaliana Enhanced growth and elevated photosynthetic amino acid is associated with plastidial adenylate kinase deficiency in Arabidopsis thaliana.

She was first created by Quality Comics in Military Comics #1 (August 1941), and was carried over to DC Comics when they purchased Quality in the 1950s. While the original Golden Age character is in public domain, the subsequent versions created by DC Comics are not. Fall 1941 was a boom period for patriotic superheroes as the country prepared to enter World War II; during this period, comic book publishers also launched Miss Victory, the Star-Spangled Kid, U.S. Jones, the Fighting Yank, the Flag, Captain Flag and Yank and Doodle, among others. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis history= Miss America is originally Joan Dale, a courageous reporter who had a dream in which the Statue of Liberty appeared to her and, giving her the power to transmute elements, instructed her to battle evil. Joan awakes to find that she now has these powers. Adopting a patriotically-themed costume, she begins fighting evil as Miss America. She had a brief run in Military Comics #1-7, then faded into obscurity to a degree that Timely Comics (later Marvel Comics) soon felt free to create an unrelated character with the same name. Initially, Miss America did not have a superhero costume, largely using her powers surreptitiously. In later stories she wears a costume consisting of a sleeveless red blouse, a red-and-white striped skirt, and a blue cape fastened with a silver star. This costume continually changes in appearance, possibly because she uses her powers to create it. Following her initial run, later appearances of the character add a red domino mask. In the 1980s, writer Roy Thomas revived the character. She is briefly referenced in the first appearance of the Freedom Fighters in the pages of All-Star Squadron, when she is said to have been a member of that group who was thought to have had been killed when Uncle Sam attempted to prevent the attack on Pearl Harbor from occurring on Earth-X. =Post-Crisis history= In the post-Crisis on Infinite Earths continuity, in the late spring of 1941 on Liberty Island, reporter Joan Dale has a dream that the Statue of Liberty comes to life and grants her the power to alter the nature of matter. Inspired by the dream, she creates a colorful costume and becomes Miss America, one of America's first heroines. In truth, she had been abducted by the top secret government agency, Project M, and her powers were actually the result of a secret experiment. They believed the experiment to be a failure and had returned her to whence she had been taken, leaving her none the wiser.Military Comics #1 (August 1941)Secret Origins #26 (May 1988) Miss America in Secret Origins #26. Later that year, the Japanese plot their attack on Pearl Harbor. Uncle Sam learns of the attack and assembles a group of heroes called the Freedom Fighters (with Hourman, the Invisible Hood, Magno, Neon the Unknown, and the Red Torpedo) to prevent it. The mission is doomed and all but Uncle Sam seemingly perish in the fight. Sam later discovers that three of his allies had survived, Miss America among them. After the mission, she is reclaimed by Project M.All-Star Squadron #31 (March 1984) When Robotman and the Young All-Stars visit Project M, they discover that Miss America is indeed alive, albeit comatose. A battle with the Ultra-Humanite breaks out, which awakens Joan from her coma. She promptly returns to the defense of her country and in late May 1942, she joins the Justice Society of America as the group's secretary.Young All-Stars #12-14, Annual #1 (May ‚Äì July 1988) In post-Crisis continuity, the original Golden Age Wonder Woman's adventures had been erased from existence and Miss America replaces her in many of the JSA's adventures. However, following a retcon in Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #128, several months after Miss America joins the JSA, a different Wonder Woman debuts on the scene and also joins the JSA. It is still unclear how this Wonder Woman's membership affected Miss America's status with the JSA, if at all.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #130-133 (February ‚Äì May 1998) Miss America is last seen as an active heroine in a flashback in JSA, where she is once more working with the Freedom Fighters. Retirement Eventually, Joan Dale's powers fade and she retires as Miss America. She marries Admiral Derek Trevor, and eventually they become the adoptive parents of Hippolyta \\"Lyta\\" Trevor Hall, who becomes the modern-day Fury in Infinity, Inc. Lyta becomes pregnant with the child of her teammate and lover, Hector Hall; however, Hector soon dies. She moves back home with her adoptive parents, Joan and Derek Trevor, and is soon reunited with Hector, who has become the new Sandman. Learning that Hector can only exist for one hour outside the Dream Dimension, Lyta and Hector marry and Lyta joins Hector in the Dream Dimension. Joan and Derek Trevor attend the wedding. While Joan Dale does not make a present-day appearance in The Sandman comic-book series, she does appear in a photograph as Miss America in The Sandman #57. One Year Later A much older Joan Dale returns in the fifth issue of Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters (January 2007) to confront a youthful imposter bearing the mantle who has, under the orders of Father Time, managed to neutralize and capture the new team of Freedom Fighters. In issue #6, Joan reveals that she never lost her powers, but used them to create the illusion that she had aged in order to retire and live a normal life with her husband. Now that Derek Trevor has died, she lets the illusion slip and resumes her youthful, heroic guise to aid Uncle Sam and his new team. While fighting the impostor Miss America, Joan discovers that the impostor is a gynoid and destroys her. Miss Cosmos In the new 2007 Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters series, Red Bee mutated into an alien-insect creature and mind-controls Joan into absorbing Human Bomb's explosive energy and taking it into space. Joan then explodes, presumed to be dead. Unbeknownst to her allies, Joan manages to keep her consciousness alive, rebuilding a new, young body from extant space materials. Evolved into a new form of life, she discards her Miss America identity to claim her new moniker: Miss Cosmos. The New 52 Joan Dale makes her New 52 debut in Human Bomb #2. Depicted as a telepath she helps Michael Taylor to control his powers and gather information about the criminal organization C.R.O.W.N.Human Bomb #2 Powers and abilities Miss America has the powers of transmutation on a molecular level. Her own inexperience with the physical sciences initially curtailed her use of the powers early in her career, usually using it for simple changes that were not permanent. There appeared to be an upper limit to the size of matter, and the duration of its transmutation, but this was never made specific. Following her recent return, Miss America appears to have become much more proficient with her powers, claiming that she would be able to transform an enemy's organs to glass or shrink them to microscopic size. Joan grew so proficient in the use of her abilities that she could change her own age at will, from an elderly woman of considerable age to a younger one in her physical prime. The impostor version who appears in Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters #5-6 could fire energy blasts and possessed the ability to psionically neutralize the Freedom Fighters' powers. Both boasted flight powers and increased physicality but it was never clarified if these were separate aspects of it or not. Her powers grew so strong that her disembodied consciousness reconstructed a new physical body out of Star Stuff from the universe after dying from absorbing an explosive detonation. Bestowing her vast cosmic powers, enough to tear through alien warships (which seem to've faded with time) as well as hinting at an odd form of Regeneration and Immortality through her total conversion abilities. Other versions =Princess Diana= As depicted in Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #184-185, Princess Diana briefly assumes the identity of Miss America. In this storyline, Diana and her then love interest, Trevor Barnes, recently complete an adventure in Skartaris and attempt to return to their proper dimension. Instead of arriving in the present, they arrive in Virginia in early October 1943. Leaving Trevor to watch the dinosaurs and Villainy Inc. (whom they battled in Skartaris), Diana goes scouting and witnesses a battle between Queen Clea (from the 1943 time period) and Diana's mother, Queen Hippolyta. Noticing that Clea is getting the upper hand in the battle, Diana decides to intervene. To avoid damaging the timestream, she disguises herself as \\"an obscure heroine during the war\\" (Miss America), whom she remembers that Hippolyta mentioned meeting once. Together, Miss America (Diana) and Hippolyta defeat the Nazis and Clea; however, one of the Nazis escapes, finds Trevor, and takes Poseidon's Trident from him. Later that same day, Hippolyta and Diana return to Washington, D.C., where Diana sees for herself the impact her mother had on the women of the city (including Hippolyta's roommate, Diana Prince). As night falls, Hippolyta and Diana (as Miss America) go hunting for Armageddon, the leader of the saboteurs. While Hippolyta defeats Armageddon, Diana recovers Poseidon's Trident and disappears. By this time, however, Hippolyta realizes that the woman she fought alongside was not the real Miss America. Either that night or the next night, Hippolyta makes a phone call to the real Miss America (Joan Dale) and confirms her suspicions. After Diana returns to the present, she realizes that her mother must have discovered that she was impersonating the real Miss America. =Elseworlds= Outside of regular DC Comics continuity, James Robinson and Paul Smith feature Miss America in 1993's The Golden Age. Joan Dale is the girlfriend of Tex Thompson, also known as Mr. America. Later in the story, disturbed by the increasingly moody and abusive actions of her lover, Joan steals Thompson's locked journal and heads to her friend Paula Brooks, the reformed costumed thief once known as the Huntress/Tigress. Paula picks the lock and soon Joan, Paula, and Paula's lover, Lance Gallant, are made aware of the same ugly fact that Paul Kirk has finally remembered: Tex Thompson is really the Ultra-Humanite. The journal, however, holds even worse revelations, prompting Paula to call Johnny Chambers, whom the story has characterized as the one superhero that everyone else came to with their problems. In the story's final chapter, a hasty war council is convened of the few mystery-men who know Thompson's secret, and a plan is made: during the upcoming ceremony in Washington at which all of America's superheroes are supposed to swear their loyalty, another new recruit will be named to Thompson's camp, who will then expose the truth about Thompson before the superhero community and the eyes of the world. However, to withstand the strength Thompson has at his disposal, the whistle-blower has to be one of the more powerful heroes, and Rex Tyler is elected. Nearly every mystery-man and superhero turns out at the nation's capital for the ceremony, but before things can begin, Joan takes to the podium and exposes Thompson herself. However, before she can tell the entire truth, Robotman brutally murders her. In other media Joan Dale appears in Reign of the Supermen, voiced by Jennifer Hale. Here, she is depicted as a president of America.

It is one of the largest wetland areas of Europe. The city of Pinsk is one of the most important in the area.Pripet Marshes Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Overview The Pinsk Marshes mostly lie within the Polesian Lowland, hence Polesie Marshes (Woodland Marshes), and occupy most of the southern part of Belarus and the north-west of Ukraine. They cover roughly surrounding the sandy lowlands of the dense network of rivers and rivulets forming on both sides of the Pripyat River, one of the main tributaries of the Dnieper. Dense woods are interspersed with numerous marshes, moors, ponds and streams extending west to east and north to south. The marshes undergo substantial changes in size during the year, with melting snows in springtime and autumn rainfall causing extensive flooding as the river overflows.  Flora  The Pinsk swamps are home to 827 species of higher plants, of which 18 are listed as endangered in the Red Book of Belarus. For the Pinsk swamps typical alternation of open sedge-reed spaces with almost impenetrable shrub thickets. During the spring flood the swamps are almost completely covered with water, so the local population often has to cross through them in boats. Main laws of the geographical distribution of marshes On dry \\"islands\\" there are areas deciduous pine forests.  Fauna  The Northern crested newt, a salamander of the marsh of Pripiat. The Pinsk swamps are home to thousands of birds from different biotopes of the Earth (Europe, Asia, Africa, Mediterranean) some of which come to nest here during migrations, and also swamps are a wintering area for many species of migratory birds nesting in northern countries such as Scandinavia, Finland, Baltic countries and Russia. Of the 246 species of birds, which has been observed on this territory 66 species are listed in the Red Book of Belarus. The park nestles a significant number of species that are globally threatened with extinction: Ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), White-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) (just 2-3 pairs has been observed), Greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga) (4-6 pairs), Corn crake (Crex crex), Great snipe (Gallinago media). The presence of so many birds of national and international significance underscores the importance of this territory for the conservation of biodiversity of Polesie, Belarus and Europe as a whole. History The marshes in a 19th-century painting by Ivan Shishkin. Historically, for most of the year, the marshes were virtually impassable to major military forces, which influenced strategic planning of all military operations in the region. In Volume VII of Wars of Justinian, by the Roman historian Procopius, is a story that the early Slavs hid out from predators in the Pripet Marshes by breathing through reeds. Like most other wetlands in Europe, the Pinsk Marshes were once seen as an unhealthy area and a focus of sickness. Land reclamation projects of the eastern part of wetlands were started in 1872 and by the late 19th century drainage of the marshes recovered 1.5 million hectares of wetlands for use as pasture and farmland. Wetlands Under Threat. World Wide Fund For Nature Living Waters Campaign. Issues Brief 1, p. 1 = First World War = At the start of World War I, the marshes separated the Austro-Hungarian Fourth Army from the XII corps; the few roads that traversed the region were narrow and largely unimproved. That left a wide gap, and the Third Army Corps of the Imperial Russian Army poured in before the Austro-Hungarian Second Army's transfer from Serbia was complete. The Russians soon captured the valuable railhead at Lemberg (now Lviv), then in the far east of Austria-Hungary (now part of the western Ukraine), as a result. Throughout the rest of the war, the wetlands remained one of the principal geographic obstacles of the Eastern Front. = Second World War = Wounded German soldiers being evacuated on a light plane in the southern zone of the Pripet Marshes. 1944 The marshes divided the central and southern theatres of operation during World War II, and they served as a hideout for both Soviet and Polish partisans. At one stage during the war, the German administration planned to drain the marshes, 'cleanse' them of their 'degenerate' inhabitants and repopulate the area with German colonists. Konrad Meyer was the leader in command of the 'Pripet plan'. Hitler scuttled the project late in 1941, as he believed that it might entail Dust Bowl conditions.Blackbourn, David, (2006). The Conquest of Nature: Water, Landscape and the Making of Modern Germany. Jonathan Cape. German racial anthropologist Theodor Poesche had proposed, in the late 19th century, that the Aryan race evolved in the marshes because of the prevalence of albinism.Theodor Poesche: The Aryans: A contribution to historical anthropology, 1878 (p. 68) - German original In 1942, after an uprising, approximately 1,000 Jews escaped from the ≈Åachwa Ghetto, of whom about 600 were able to take refuge in the Pinsk Marshes. Known as Pripjet-S√ºmpfe by the Germans, the wetlands were dreaded by the Wehrmacht troops. During the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the Third Reich armies skirted the wetlands, passing through the north or south of it. However, after the debacle of the Eastern Front in 1944, many retreating units such as the 7th, 35th, 134th and 292nd Infantry Divisions had to cut across the marshy areas. They often needed to build tracks with logs over which they could pull light loads in horse-drawn vehicles.Pictorial History Of The Second World War; Volume III - Fighting on the Pripet Marshes = Proposed drainage in 1950s = There was a plan to drain the wetlands during 1952, when the area of the marshes was under Soviet administration.Karakov, G.

In this sense, a ground rent is created when a freehold piece of land is sold on a long lease or leases.see Department for Communities and Local Government The ground rent provides an income for the landowner.www.landlordzone: Ground rents In economics, ground rent is a form of economic rent meaning all value accruing to titleholders as a result of the exclusive ownership of title privilege to location. History In Roman law, ground rent (solarium) was an annual rent payable by the lessee of a superficies (a piece of land), or perpetual lease of building land. In early Norman England, tenants could lease their title to land so that the land- owning lords did not have any power over the sub-tenant to collect taxes. In 1290 King Edward I passed the Statute of Quia Emptores that prevented tenants from leasing their lands to others through subinfeudation. This created a system of substitution, where the tenant's full interest would be transferred to the purchaser or donee, who would pay a rentcharge. This system later passed into common law in England and was adopted by many nations which trace their legal heritage to Britain. Classical economists and Georgists quantify ground rent to investigate and capture unearned income called economic rent, as distinct from labor-made income. Valuation The value of the freehold interest comprises: * A multiple of the current annual ground rent payable, which will depend on ** the outstanding term of the lease ** any future scheduled increases in the level of ground rent ** market interest rates ** the probability of default ** if the rents for individual flats etc. are small, the cost of collection * The net present value of the reversion, i.e. at the end of the lease the freeholder (to whom the rent is paid) will probably be fully entitled to the property, so the shorter the lease the greater the reversion value. * Any attributable \\"marriage value\\" (a substantial sum designed to compensate freeholders for their loss of interest when a lease with less than 80 years to run is extended). In economics, ground rent means all economic value accruing to owners of land, regardless of whether payments are explicitly made or the rents are imputed. Various assessment methodologies are employed by real estate appraisers. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the rights of residential tenants of property subject to a long lease at a ground rent are governed by the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 for houses and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 for flats. =England and Wales= In English law, it appears that the term \\"ground rent\\" was at one time popularly used for the houses and lands out of which ground rents issue, as well as for the rents themselves.Maundy v. Maundy, 2 Strange, 1020 Lord Eldon observed in 1815 that the context in which the term occurred may materially vary its meaning.Stewart v. Alliston, I Mer. 26 The contemporary accepted meaning of ground rent is the rent at which land is let for the purpose of improvement by building: i.e. a rent charged in respect of the land only, and not in respect of the buildings to be placed thereon. It is therefore usually lower than the rent that might be achieved for a building let on the open market, and is let for a longer term ‚Äî at least 21 years, but more commonly 99 years, 125 years, or even 999 years. Inflation has eroded the value of ground rents on properties prior to 2003 often with long leases and non-rising incomes, so their value is often now small where there is no prospect of a reversion (when the ownership of the property reverts to the freeholder) within say 150 years. However developers are now exploiting ground rents on new builds, and even selling houses as leasehold to profit from the ground rent, that can be as onerous as the council tax.Ground rent scandal Guardian The Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 and The Landlord and Tenant (Notice of Rent) (England) Regulations 2004 now govern the form of notice that needs to be issued to collect ground rent. Previously there had been a problem with some landlords sending confusing or dishonest demands for payments to tenants. Under the terms of a lease agreement, the freeholder (the outright owner of the land or property) grants permission for a leaseholder to take ownership of the property for a specified period of time. This could range from 21 years to 999 years and during this time the leaseholder will pay ground rent to the freeholder. Freeholders lease property primarily for the initial premium paid by the original leaseholder for granting the lease; but in addition ground rent (often a token amount) will be payable over a long term, and this may be an attractive fixed income investment for some types of investor.Ground Rents & Ground Rent Payments. Retrieved 6 July 2010. The final sanction available to a landlord faced with a leaseholder in breach of the lease due to the failure to pay the service charges, ground rent or administration charges, is to forfeit the lease and to repossess the house or flat. To do this the landlord must first serve a valid notice under section 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925 - the Notice of Seeking Possession. However, the landlord cannot serve a section 146 notice where the amount of service charges, administration charges or ground rent owed (or a combination of all of these) unless the unpaid amount is more than ¬£350 or consists of, or includes, an amount that has been outstanding for more than three years. There are a number of companies which specialise in buying ground rents for long term investment from landlords who want to sell their ground rents. Normally they focus on purchasing reversionary ground rents, either for initial income or for the opportunity of a reversion of the underlying property at some point in the future. The value of ground rents is affected by the rent review pattern on future income increases, the value of the underlying property, the unexpired lease length and whether marriage value is applicable.\\"Buying a flat? Beware marriage values\\". Retrieved 18 April 2016.\\"Sportelli, Marriage Value and Falling Property Prices\\". Retrieved 18 April 2016. Prior to selling ground rents there is a statutory obligation incumbent on both parties that Section V notices are served on the long leaseholders. This gives them a two-month period within which to respond. Upon expiry of the notice, a transaction can proceed at the price stated on the notice or higher (but not lower) for up to 12 months subsequently. The only way this can be avoided is for exchange of contracts on the sale of the ground rent of flats to have taken place prior to 50% of the flats being sold. This then allows completion upon sale of the last flats without the need for Section V notices. Before 2003 the Land Registry recorded the ground rent, and the rent is evident from the entry that can be requested from the website. From 13 October 2003 the Land Registry changed its procedures, and there is no longer any provision for entering the rent on the register. [land registry act 2003] In the past, ground rent was usually not onerous, at typically around ¬£100 per year, and often freeholders would not request payment. But in the 2010s, developers and builders are often issuing leases for new residential units with ground rents as high as ¬£1000 per annum, with escalation clauses doubling the rent every 5 or 10 years. This can result in subsequent mortgage refusals, and make the property unsellable. Leaseholders have a right after 2 years to extend the lease and reduce ground rent to \\"peppercorn\\" or zero, but developers have responded with 999 year leases that make the valuation - based on the ground rent and term - beyond the reach of leaseholders, and sell the freehold - often before the development is finished - to exploitative offshore companies. The English \\"ground rent scandal\\" has been widely reported in the press. In 2016 MP Peter Bottomley described the scandal of ground rents as \\"legalised extortion\\". In response to questions raised by the MP communities secretary Sajid Javid said: ‚ÄúWe must make sure the kind of abuses he mentioned are stamped out and we will continue to do everything [we can]. We do work with a number of stakeholders and we can certainly see how we can do more.‚Äù In June 2018 the UK government announced that leasehold tenure would be reformed, with new long leases having zero ground rent. =Scotland= In Scots law, the term ground rent is not employed, but its place is taken, for practical purposes, by the ground annual, which bears a double meaning: * At the time of the Reformation in Scotland, the lands of the Church were parcelled out by the crown into various lordships, the grantees being called \\"Lords of Erection\\". In the 17th century these Lords of Erection resigned their superiorities to the crown, with the exception of the feu-duties, which were to be retained till a price agreed upon for their redemption had been paid. This reserved power of redemption was, however, resigned by the crown on the eve of the Union and the feu-duties became payable in perpetuity to the Lords of Erection as a ground annual. * Speculators in building ground usually grant sub-feus to builders at a high feu-duty. But where sub-feus are prohibited ‚Äî they might have been prior to the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874 ‚Äî and there is much demand for building ground, the feuars frequently stipulate that the builder pay an annual rent rather than purchase the land outright. This annual rent is called a ground annual. Interest is not due on arrears of ground annuals and, like other real burdens, ground annuals may now be freely assigned and conveyed. Feu duty in Scotland was ended by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000. =Northern Ireland= Redemption of ground rents in Northern Ireland is covered by the Ground Rents Act (Northern Ireland) 2001. Republic of Ireland In the Republic of Ireland ground rents have been a feature of urban life. While most tenancy reform legislation has been enacted for agricultural land (see Irish Land Acts), urban occupiers / tenants have been allowed to \\"buy out\\" their ground rents from landlords, and so effectively change a long lease into a freehold interest, most recently under Acts of 19781978 Irish Act and 2005.Irish Act of 2005 Notably, ground rents in Castlebar, County Mayo have been withheld following the controversial disappearance of Lord Lucan in 1974.2004 Article on Lord Lucan  Netherlands Ground leases (erfpachten) are common in the Netherlands. However most Dutch municipalities (including Rotterdam, Den Bosch, Eindhoven, Haarlem and Maastricht) are currently abandoning the system, and offering householders the right to buy their plot of land. However a number, including Amsterdam, are retaining ground leases, which ease comprehensive redevelopment, prevent land speculation and mean that the entire community benefits from any increase in value of the land. * On 1 July 2016 Amsterdam introduced the option of permanent ground leases as well as temporary and continuous ground leases. Householders had until 8 January 2020 to apply under advantageous terms to convert their ground lease to a perpetual basis, which means that it will indexed to inflation and will not rise unpredictably at the end of each term.https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/housing/ground-lease/ *Diemen, Hendrik-Ido- Ambacht, Utrecht and Vlaardingen (new rules in 2013) are also retaining ground rent. * The Hague introduced a new system of leasehold and ownership on 1 April 2008. Householders can purchase their land at 5% of 55% of the value of built-up land to convert their perpetual leasehold into ownership. For larger office buildings and industrial buildings over 100 m¬≤ and areas that do not yet have a current use, the ground lease remains in force. *In the province of Groningen a variant survives in which there is an everlasting right of leasehold, the beklemrecht (right of oppression). =Law and mortgages= In the Netherlands, ground lease is regulated by Title 7 of Book 5 of the Dutch Civil Code. In many cases, long-term leaseholds become qualified indexed loans, creating tax benefits. Since 2010, banks have been applying stricter rules when providing mortgages on residential leasehold properties. Only new indefinite leases issued from 1 January 2013 are still eligible for a mortgage. These contracts must comply with the \\"Banking Directive on financing lease rights\\" of the Dutch Banking Association. Fixed-term contracts, for example 30 or 49 years, are excluded, while existing fixed-term contracts issued before 1 January 2013 are eligible for mortgage financing, provided the conditions meet the eligibility criteria of the Dutch Banking Association. Banks have decided to do this because they fear that the landowner will implement substantial increases, which will lead to payment problems for the leaseholder. Owners of leasehold properties wishing to sell their house are increasingly confronted with this restriction. The house appears to be unsaleable in many cases because new prospective buyers cannot get the financing. United States of America The term ground rent is applied in many U.S. states to a kind of tenure created by a grant in fee simple, the grantor reserving to himself and his heirs a certain rent, which is the interest in the money value of the land. =Maryland= The State of Maryland maintains provisions for ground rents, primarily in the Baltimore area. The practice dates back to the seventeenth century, when lesserlords and serfs paid crops and livestock to feudal lords to rent the lord's land. With ground rent, homeowners only own the building itself, but they must pay a small amount to rent the land itself from its owner. Under Maryland law, if ground rent is not paid on time, the ground owner can go to court and have a lien placed against the house, effectively seizing the home from the homeowner over a relatively small amount due, sometimes as little as $24. This occurred almost 4,000 times in Baltimore City from 2000 to 2005. In addition, properties with ground rent are usually valued about $10,000 less than comparable properties without ground rent. In 2007, an emergency bill was presented by Democratic Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley to completely ban new ground rents and prevent ground owners from seizing houses from delinquent homeowners. The bill was passed by the legislature. Maryland state law required all ground owners to register the ownership of the land with the state by September 2008 or else the ground ownership is automatically extinguished. As of 2008, there were about 85,000 in Maryland. The new laws were contested in court for some ground owners, who called it an unconstitutional taking of property without fair compensation. In 2011, the law was ruled unconstitutional by the Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, to the extent that it purported to extinguish property rights of leaseholders.. New ground rent leases can no longer be created after January 22, 2007https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1000516&crid;=74ff2316-4e80-48b1-ac6c-db76b255a02c&pddocfullpath;=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fstatutes- legislation%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5PKD-0FC0-004F-01VC-00008-00&pddocid;=urn%3AcontentItem%3A5PKD-0FC0-004F-01VC-00008-00&pdcontentcomponentid;=234188&pdteaserkey;=sr0&pditab;=allpods&ecomp;=dy_fk&earg;=sr0&prid;=f7a5bcad- ec91-4188-b1bc-7321ffc4464d, and ground rent owners must register their leases with the State Department of Assessments in order to collect rents or file a lien for unpaid rentshttps://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1000516&crid;=ac117575-aaf1-4b65-87f4-7de08a1b63cc&pddocfullpath;=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fstatutes- legislation%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5PKD-0F80-004F-015V-00008-00&pdtocnodeidentifier;=ABEAAJAAIAAH&ecomp;=sfxtk&prid;=792b5bce-736a-4bc6-b3f1-bcf37507b6f1 (although failure to register no longer risks extinguishment of the property right). =Pennsylvania= Ground rents in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are considered real estate and, in cases of intestacy, go to the heirs. They are rent services and not rent charges, the statute Quia Emptores never having been in force in Pennsylvania, and are subject to all the incidents of such rents. The grantee of a ground rent may mortgage, sell, or otherwise dispose of the grant as he pleases, and while the rent is paid the land cannot be sold or the value of the improvements lost. The owner of land can occupy it, or can improve it and sell the improvements (such as structures), while retaining title to the land, and charge the buyer ground rent. A ground rent being a freehold estate, created by deed, and perpetual in duration, no presumption that it had been released could, at common law, arise from lapse of time. However, by statute (Act of 27 April 1855, s. 7), a presumption of release or extinguishment is created where no payment, claim, or demand has been made for the rent, nor any declaration or acknowledgment of its existence made or given by the owner of the premises subject to it, for a period of twenty-one years. Ground rents were formerly irredeemable after a certain time, but the creation of irredeemable ground rents is now forbidden (Pennsylvania Act 7 Assembly, 22 April 1850). =Virginia= The Commonwealth of Virginia permits residential ground rents, which are defined by statute: Code of Virginia ¬ß 55-79.01.B. (The obligor is the party obliged to pay, and the obligee the party entitled to receive, the ground rent.) The amount of a ground rent may be changed by either party once every five years, but, unless the parties agree otherwise, the amount of such a change may be no greater than the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (or other standard prescribed by statute) during the previous three years. A ground rent constitutes a lien against the real estate. The terms of the ground rent agreement may be incorporated into the deed or other instrument of transfer, according to a statutory form.

Another critically acclaimed Arthaus Music release dated April 2011, the Bach Jazz DVD brought together their ECO concert under the baton of Sir Colin Davis and the duo and trio Bach-Jazz piano concertos with Jacques Loussier. Celebrating the centurial first performance of Igor Stravinsky's ‚ÄúThe Rite of Spring‚Äù, Decca, DG and Philips released the work's most important recordings between 1913 and today, in December 2012. This CD- Box is also including the Pekinels DG recording in 1984. The 50CD-Box Set ‚Äò‚ÄôLegacy‚Äô‚Äô with works of selected artists, released by Erarto/Teldec in November 2013, is including 5 recordings by Pekinels. Their last DVD and CD with live recordings of Bartok‚Äôs Concerto and live recital recordings of Schubert, Mozart, Debussy and Infante, was released in September 2014 by Arthaus / Unitel and was nominated for the 2015 ‚Äò‚ÄôPreis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik‚Äô‚Äô. The Turkish Government awarded the title \\"Devlet Sanat√ßƒ±sƒ±\\" (literally \\"State Artist\\" or \\"National Artist\\") to the Pekinel sisters in 1991, a rare honor. G√ºher and S√ºher Pekinel are holders of honorary doctorate degrees from Boƒüazi√ßi University as well as holders of the 2013 Istanbul Culture and Arts Foundation ‚ÄúHonorary Award‚Äù for their lifetime achievements. Education projects G√ºher and S√ºher Pekinel have also pioneered three significant music education projects. Their first project aims to further professional music education in Turkey to meet international standards. Entitled ‚ÄúYoung Musicians on World Stages‚Äù, the project, sponsored by Turkish firm Ko√ß / T√úPRA≈û, supports twelve young musicians by granting them qualitatively instruments and scholarships to study with distinguished musicians and pedagogues in Europe and to participate in international music competitions. Within five years, the scholars have been awarded seven first prizes and four second prizes at international competitions. Pekinel's received the best social responsibility award for their ‚ÄúYoung Musicians on World Stages‚Äù project in 2011. Their second project was launched in 2007 by founding the G&S; Pekinel Music Department in the private boarding school TEVIT√ñL for gifted children from throughout Turkey. This scheme has achieved integration for the first time in Turkey into the standard musical curriculum and is now accepted as credit at notable universities. The third project initiated by Pekinels‚Äô concentrates on their vision to establish the globally implemented Orff Schulwerk Method at kindergartens and primary schools in Turkey to raise the creativity, self-confidence, and analytical skills of children. Since September 2010, the Ministry of National Education and Orff Schulwerk Turkey-Austria-Germany have been working within the framework of a joint protocol to ensure that this important project succeeds.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1959 to 1977, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Walter Weir. The son of William Watt and Annabelle Milliken, Watt was educated at Hillview schools, and worked as a farmer. In 1936, he married Rossie Grace Smeltz. He was an active freemason, and became deputy reeve of Pipestone municipality in 1958. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election on November 26, 1959, defeated Liberal-Progressive candidate Harry Patmore by 77 votes in the rural riding of Arthur, in the province's southwestern corner. He was re-elected over Patmore by a greater margin in the 1962 general election, and served as a backbench supporter of Dufferin Roblin's government. In the 1966 election, Watt defeated Patmore for a third time by 95 votes. Weir replaced Roblin as Premier in 1967, and Watt entered cabinet as Minister of Agriculture on September 24, 1968. His tenure in office was short-lived, as the Progressive Conservatives lost power to the New Democratic Party following the 1969 election. Watt increased his own majority in the 1969 election, as Liberal support declined throughout the province (the NDP did not have a strong support base in Arthur). He was re-elected again by a significant margin in the 1973 election, and retired in 1977. He died in Reston at the age of 71.

It was launched on April 17, 2000. Characters =Primary= * Baldomero \\"Baldo\\" Bermudez is the titular character. A Latino teenager, his primary interests are cars and girls. He is also obsessed with being cool, and is in the middle of an ongoing process to build his own lowrider. He has a job at Auto Y Rod, an auto supply shop (whose logo resembles that of Mercedes-Benz), and according to comic strips in January 2007 and August 2011, he is 15 years old. * Graciela \\"Gracie\\" Bermudez is Baldo's annoying younger sister. She is an ardent admirer of Frida Kahlo, and frequently attempts to be an activist. She is remarkably intelligent and enjoys reading, although she is a constant annoyance to her older brother. In a May 2009 strip that quotes from the Wikipedia article, Gracie declared that she wrote that article for Wikipedia in Cinco de Mayo. * Sergio \\"Papi\\" Bermudez, a widower, is the patriarch of the family, the father of Baldo and Gracie, and the owner of a small business. He is often seen by his children as being dorky, although they love him all the same. * Tia Carmen is Baldo and Gracie's ditzy great-aunt. An older woman and very devout in her religious beliefs (she has over 200 religious figurines), Carmen has a vast knowledge and love of ancient world customs, foods, and herbal remedies. An April Fools' Day gag strip in 2007 depicted her as being detained by the Department of Homeland Security, and a two-week series around the same time drawn in a photo-realistic style told of her as coming to live with the Bermudezes after Sergio's wife Rosa was killed in a drunk driving accident (see below). * Cruz is Baldo's best friend. In 2017, it was explained that Cruz is a \\"dreamer,\\" an immigrant brought to the United States as a child. Arguably similar to Hector from Zits, Cruz is often seen accompanying Baldo in the quest for coolness. =Secondary= * Nora is Gracie's Afro-Cuban best friend and confidant. She is as bright and intelligent as Gracie. * Beatriz is a young woman, formerly a co-worker at Auto Y Rod. She made a first appearance on the March 5th, 2007. Baldo liked her on a first sight, but later in the strip she told him that she has a boyfriend, although she has since broken up with him. Her appearances have become more common. On the June 17th, 2010 comic, it is revealed that her last name is Ortiz. In the strip published on Friday, August 1, 2014, she was laid off from her job. * Rayna is Cruz's girlfriend. She has a congenitally compromised immune system and can't leave her home, attending classes and dates by means of a telepresence robot. * Ralphie is a friend of Baldo's who owns a low rider with an advanced sound system. He infrequently appears in the strip. * El Cucuy is the Bermudez family's boogeyman, and is somewhat akin to the snorklewacker from Bloom County. He was forced into retirement after Baldo and Gracie stopped fearing him. * Joey was a semi-recurring white teenager and one of Baldo's former co-workers at Auto Y Rod. He had a poor work ethic and his ignorance of the Spanish language and Latino culture. Even with his bad work ethic, Joey was promoted to assistant manager, which frustrated Baldo even more, until Joey then gets fired due to his continuing dull work, and Baldo becomes the new assistant manager. * Estella Dank is Baldo's current girlfriend. She first appeared on August 23, 2011. * Britney Denise \\"Smiley\\" Rogers is Baldo's white ex-girlfriend. She was originally introduced in 2001 as Baldo's new next door neighbor, somewhat plain and tomboyish, with an interest in Latino culture, and was Baldo's girlfriend from 2003 to 2006. Shortly after the breakup, Smiley underwent a sudden makeover, joined a popular girls' clique, and started going by her middle name. * Sylvia Sanchez was considered the \\"prettiest girl in school\\" by Baldo, and the object of his eye from the earlier strips. She removed from the strip in 2003, shortly before Baldo and Smiley began dating. * Billy is an antagonistic, subtly bigoted white teen who spoke his prejudice against Latinos by accusing them of discriminating against him. Consequently he is disturbed by the emergence of Latino oriented businesses. He is generally a caricature of those who express their bigotry with arguments of reverse discrimination. During a march for immigration rights, he is seen as a counter-demonstrator telling a reporter about the dangers of illegal immigrants. * Smiley's brother is the Rogers equivalent of Gracie. For a brief time, he was Gracie's \\"boyfriend\\", but that relationship has since been dissolved. * Mr. HaroldBaldocomics.com was the Gang Activity Monitor at Baldo's school. He had a \\"tough guy\\" image, and falsely accused Baldo of being in a gang after mistaking a game of Paper Rock Scissors for gang signals. * Rosa Bermudez was Baldo and Gracie's mother, and Sergio's wife. Though she has never been seen or heard in the strip (except that her face has been shown in the form of a framed photo), it has been revealed that she had died in a car accident when Baldo was 10 years old.Baldocomics.com The April 3, 2007 strip‚Äîpart of a sequence atypically drawn in a realistic style‚Äîstated that a car driven by an inebriated motorist collided with Rosa's minivan when she drove Baldo and Gracie from a soccer game. The collision killed Rosa instantly and bruised Gracie. Baldo's soccer ball apparently saved his life in the accident. The April 4, 2007 strip shows Rosa's face, drawn realistically, in a framed photo; other strips (including May 17 & 18, 2002 and September 28, 2003) show her, again in photos, in cartoon form. * Gregorio who was introduced on the March 26, 2007 comic, is the one who Tia Carmen has been talking to about Rosa's accident and why she had come to live with Baldo and Family. They met at the tomato section of a store. * Roberto is Tia Carmen's departed husband. Sometimes his spirit visits Tia (in her imagination) for a short time. Notes Although primarily a strip focused merely on light humor, Baldo has at times delved into political and social subjects relevant to the Latino community, such as lottery scams, the 2006 United States immigration reform protests, and greater involvement in improving one's community. Baldo also allows guest artists during Hispanic Heritage Month; these guests generally depict Latinos crude stereotypes, often go on about on low rider cars and women in very revealing clothing. This has resulted in both praise and criticism from readers, whose letters have been posted on Baldo's official website and then answered (sometimes sarcastically) by the strip's creators. In 2009, the strip also dealt with Sergio developing diabetes. Gracie especially reminded Sergio of the need for proper diet and exercise to control his illness, but little mention has been made of Sergio's diabetes after the initial run of strips.

Williams is widely regarded as the defining artist of Wales during the 20th century. Personal life Williams was born in Llangefni, Anglesey, one of two sons into an old landed Anglesey family. His father was a bank manager. Williams wrote that his mother was an emotionally repressed woman who had a virulent dislike of the Welsh and the Welsh language. (Chapter three) Kyffin Williams was educated at Moreton Hall School then Shrewsbury School where he contracted polio encephalitis which lead him to develop epilepsy, a misfortune he later described as \\"my greatest fortune\\". He joined the 6th Battalion Royal Welch Fusiliers as a lieutenant in 1937. After he failed a British Army medical examination in 1941 (because of epilepsy), his doctor advised him to take up art for the sake of his health. He developed a passion for art when he discovered the works of Piero Della Francesca. Despite academic difficulties‚Äîhe was told initially by his tutor that he couldn't draw‚ÄîWilliams enrolled at London's Slade School of Fine Art in 1941 (then relocated in Oxford). When he finished his 3 years there he left with the Slade Portrait Prize. He then achieved his ambition to teach art by accepting a position at Highgate School, London, where he was senior art master from 1944 until 1973. His pupils included the historian Sir Martin Gilbert, Royal Academicians Anthony Green and Patrick Procktor and composers John Tavener and John Rutter. He painted a portrait of the school's cricket coach, former test player Albert Knight. Wales never left his consciousness or imagination, as he would return home in holidays, take his study sketches back to London and complete his canvasses. Williams' particular technique was applying thick oil paint with a palette knife. Williams was predominately a landscape painter but he also was an accomplished portraitist and something of a cartoonist. His paintings basically divide into three subjects: Venice, Patagonia and by far the largest section, Wales. In 1968 he won a scholarship (Winston Churchill Fellowship) to study and paint in Y Wladfa, the Welsh settlement in Patagonia, South America. This added a significant body of work to his oeuvre (nearly 50 Patagonia paintings) and the light in Patagonia radically changed his palette. On retiring from Highgate school Williams returned to Anglesey and spent the next 30 years painting, and promoting Welsh schools of Art and Welsh art in general. Never having married, Williams died, without heirs, on 1 September 2006, aged 88, at a nursing home at St Tysilio Nursing Home on Anglesey. He had been at the home on the outskirts of Llanfairpwll for just over a week after spending two weeks as a patient at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor.https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/kind-gentle-not- afraid-speak-2888679 He had been suffering from prostate cancer and from lung cancer, believed to be a result of working with lead-based paints. Williams was buried at St Mary's Church, Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy. Paying tribute to Williams after his death, bass-baritone singer and Williams collector Bryn Terfel said, \\"I'm deeply saddened by the passing of Wales's foremost ambassador in the visual arts. Long may his memory live on in the legacy of his numerous, wonderful paintings.\\" In 1949 Williams had his first one-man- show at a private gallery in London. His first Patagonia exhibition took place in 1971. Later in 2006, the Welsh singer and Manic Street Preachers frontman James Dean Bradfield included a track called \\"Which Way to Kyffin\\", dedicated to Williams, on his album The Great Western.Preacher man's tribute to artist; Bradfield sings solo about painter Sir Kyffin Williams at Questia Online Library As an artist Dafydd Iwan album cover based on Williams' painting Lle Cul, Patagonia (1968) His works typically drew inspiration from the Welsh landscape and farmlands. His works may be seen in a permanent exhibition in the Oriel Kyffin Williams Gallery which opened in 2008 at Oriel Ynys M√¥n in Llangefni, Anglesey, as well as at many other galleries elsewhere in Britain. He was president of the Royal Cambrian Academy and was appointed a member of the Royal Academy in 1974. In 1995 Williams received the Glynd≈µr Award for an Outstanding Contribution to the Arts in Wales during the Machynlleth Festival. He was awarded the OBE for his services to the arts in 1982 and was knighted in 1999. The Kyffin Williams Drawing Prize was established in 2009. The winning works from the 2018 prize are due to be exhibited at the Oriel Kyffin Williams Gallery. In February 2011 it was announced that Williams' paintings of Patagonia would be shown for the first time. His last passport, on show in the Oriel Ynys M√¥n gallery at Llangefni, 2004‚Äì2014, has the name Sir John Williams. Kyffin was his grandmother's maiden name. Williams was a great raconteur and also a fine writer, publishing his autobiography in \\"Across the Straits\\" and \\"A wider sky\\". The National Library of Wales was one of the first national institutions to purchase one of his works in the late forties and continue to support his work throughout his life. In acknowledgement of his gratitude for their support he bequeath them his papers and a significant body of his works to the National library. They now hold probably the largest single body of his works. Williams' works are held in many public collections, including the Government Art Collection, the Arts Council Collection and the National Museum of Wales.  Legacy  Williams' work is in the collections of a number of Welsh museums and galleries. In June 2018, he was the subject of a 50-minute BBC Television documentary, Kyffin Williams: The Man Who Painted Wales, presented by Josie d'Arby. Williams' former home, the Grade 2 listed cottage \\"Min y M√¥r\\", on the banks of the Menai Strait, was later available as a holiday let.https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/sir-kyffin- williams-anglesey- cottage-2764113#:~:text=at%20any%20time.-,THE%20former%20Anglesey%20home%20of%20the%20late%20Sir%20Kyffin%20Williams,artist's%20home%20for%2030%20years.

Life and career Kunze was born in 1872 in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota to Fred Kunze and Minnie Kunze (n√©e Krueger). He attended school in New Ulm, Minnesota before moving to the Twin Cities to attend college. After taking preparatory classes at Hamline University he transferred to the University of Minnesota where he graduated in 1897 with a degree in chemistry. Kunze worked as a teacher and school administrator for almost a decade holding positions in Lake City, Red Wing, Hastings and Saint Paul. In 1902 he married Galena Muedeking of Owatonna, Minnesota with whom he had three children. Around 1910 he turned to a career in business and found work with a heating and ventilating company in Minneapolis. In 1910 he was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives for a single term.

The pod can rotate 360 degrees allowing for rapid changes in thrust direction and thus vessel direction. This eliminates the need for a conventional rudder. The Z-drive is so named because of the appearance (in cross section) of the mechanical driveshaft or transmission configuration used to connect the mechanically supplied driving energy to the Z-Drive azimuth thruster device. This form of power transmission is called a Z-drive because the rotary motion has to make two right angle turns, thus resembling the letter \\"Z\\". This name is used to differentiate the arrangement of drive to that of the L-drive. It does not refer to an electric motor in a rotating pod. The device is different from the Voith-Schneider marine propulsion system (also mechanically linked), which can also quickly change the direction of thrust, as the Z-drive uses a shrouded conventional screw that pivots or rotates the propeller, unlike the variable-geometry blades of the Voith-Schneider. Origins The Z-drive transmission was invented in 1950 by Joseph Becker, the founder of Schottel, and used in the first azimuth thrusters built by Schottel GmbH in Germany in the 1960s under the Schottel brand name and referred to as Rudderpropeller ever since. Joseph Becker was awarded the Elmer A. Sperry Award for this invention as a major contribution to the improvement of transportation worldwide.

She first appeared in Marvel Mystery Comics #49 (Nov. 1943), and was created by writer Otto Binder and artist Al Gabriele for Timely Comics, the 1940s precursor of Marvel, in the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. Publication history As superheroes began to fade out of fashion in the post-World War II era, comic-book publishers scrambled to explore new types of stories, characters, and audiences. In an attempt to appeal to young female readers, comics companies began introducing more female superheroes, including Timely's Blonde Phantom, Golden Girl, Namora, Sun Girl, and Venus, and its teen-humor star Millie the Model; Fox Comics' revival of Quality Comics' Phantom Lady; and DC's Black Canary. Quality Comics had featured an unrelated character called Miss America in Military Comics in 1941 and 1942. In 1943, Timely Comics published Marvel Mystery Comics #49, featuring a new character by the name \\"Miss America\\". Following two appearances in Marvel Mystery, Timely's Miss America received her own book, Miss America Comics (no cover date) in early 1944. She was the third female comic book heroine to get her own solo book, after Wonder Woman and Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. Some sources list Ken Bald as the cover and interior artist, though Vincent Fago, Timely's interim editor for the drafted Stan Lee, recalled, \\"I hired a friend from the animation business, Pauline Loth, and she did the art for the first Miss America book\\". Fago has also stated, \\"I hired her at Timely when she left Fleischer's and came to New York. She did \\"Miss America\\" for us and created her costume.\\" The series changed format with its second issue to become the larger, magazine-sized Miss America, though with the conventional comic book combination of glossy covers and newsprint interior. Initiating this format as vol. 1, #2 (Nov. 1944), the publication relegated its superhero to a secondary role and began focusing on teen-romance comics stories plus articles on such topics as cooking, fashion, and makeup. This second issue‚Äîwhich featured a photo-cover of an unknown model dressed in the Miss America costume‚Äîalso introduced the long-running, teen-humor comics feature \\"Patsy Walker\\". According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, Miss America \\"fights ordinary criminals, Axis agents, Baron Shinto the Gouger, the murderous teen the Cherub, King Cobra, and the human electric eel the Shocker.\\" Together with the single superhero comic, Miss America ran 126 issues in a complicated numbering that continued through vol. 7, #50 (March 1953), the 83rd issue. It then reverted to comic book format as Miss America vol. 1, #51‚Äì93 (April 1953 ‚Äì Nov. 1958). The magazine format had used photo covers of everyday teens. In 1951, starting with vol. #7, #42 (GCD Cover Gallery showing the change), the logo changed to Patsy Walker Starring in Miss America, with covers now depicting high schooler, Patsy, boyfriend, Buzz Baxter, and romantic-rival, Hedy Wolfe, in cartoon art by, variously, Al Jaffee or Morris Weiss. The character appeared in a posthumous flashback in the Marvel Comics publication Giant-Size Avengers #1 (Aug. 1974). Fictional character biography Socially aware teenaged heiress Madeline Joyce was born in Washington, D.C., and was the niece and ward of radio mogul James Bennet, who was sponsoring a Professor Lawson, a scientist claiming to have gotten superpowers through a device that had been struck by lightning. Joyce, secretly tampering with the contraption during a thunderstorm that night, herself gained the ability to fly and great strength after lightning similarly struck, knocking her unconscious (she originally had x-ray vision, as well as other powers, but after her few early appearances they were retconned). The panicky scientist, seeing the apparently dead young woman, destroyed the device and then killed himself. Joyce survived to fight crime as the patriotically garbed Miss America, appearing regularly in Marvel Mystery Comics and All Winners Comics. Cover detail, All Winners Comics #21 (Winter 1946‚Äì47): In a superhero rarity, Miss America wears glasses. In the latter, she was a member of Timely's superhero team the All-Winners Squad, fighting alongside Captain America and Bucky, the original Human Torch and Toro, the Sub-Mariner, and the Whizzer in the group's two Golden Age adventures. In the second of these, she wore glasses, one of the extremely few superheroes to require them. Miss America made her final Golden Age appearance in Marvel Mystery Comics #85 (Feb. 1948). Joyce was later revealed to have married fellow Golden Age superhero Robert Frank (the Whizzer). Because the two had been exposed to radiation, their first child was the radioactive mutant Nuklo. However, Joyce died of complications stemming from childbirth with her second, stillborn child due to radiation poisoning from her first offspring while at Wundagore Mountain, Transia.Giant-Size Avengers #1 (Aug. 1974) It was also suggested during this time that Joyce and Frank were the parents of Avengers members Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, although this was ultimately refuted when it was revealed that Magneto and his wife Magda were those twins' biological parents. Miss America was then retconned in 1976 as a member of the World War II super-team the Liberty Legion, set between the creation of the Invaders and the post-war All-Winners Squad. As a member of the Liberty Legion, she battled the Red Skull, and alongside the Liberty Legion and Invaders she batted the Nazi super-team Super-Axis.Marvel Premiere #29‚Äì30 Miss America returned from the dead for 24 hours in the 2006 miniseries X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl, where she was revealed to be spending an eternity in Hell. However, in the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z, select entries of characters featured in that miniseries, including that of the Ancient One, state that the characters in hell were impostors. Miss America's reanimated corpse later appears as a cyborg resident of the Core, a subterranean city populated by advanced robots.Secret Avengers #23 The cyborg does battle with Miss America's former teammate, the Human Torch, and attempts to lull him into a false sense of security. The Torch however, realizes that the cyborg is not really his old friend, merely a puppet using her body.Secret Avengers #25 Powers and abilities An electrical discharge from an unknown experimental piece of equipment gave Madeline Joyce the ability to levitate herself through psionic means. By using her levitation ability in connection with carefully planned leaps, Miss America could use her power to fly. She could attain any height at which she could still breathe (approximately 20,000 feet). She could use this power for about 2 hours before mental fatigue would force her to rest. Also fatigue poisons accumulate much slower in her body than that of a normal human, giving her a heightened \\"vitality.\\" Miss America also possessed the \\"Strength of a Thousand Men\\", allowing her to lift weights far heavier than a normal human would be capable of lifting. In addition, Miss America originally possessed the power to project \\"X-Ray Vision\\". This power faded over time, leaving her with a need for glasses. Other characters named Miss America *America Chavez, another superhero using the moniker Miss America, first appeared in the 2011 limited series Vengeance by Joe Casey and Nick Dragotta. *In the Avengers: The Initiative Annual #1, a new version of the Liberty Legion, known as the Liberteens, based in Pennsylvania, debuted, one of their number calling herself Ms. America, and possessing the same powers of flight and strength as the original Miss America. In other media * Miss America was loosely adapted for the 1979 Japanese TV series Battle Fever J as part of a collaboration between Marvel Comics and the studio Toei. Despite retaining the name, the costume and character were both changed for the series. * The Madeline Joyce version of Miss America appears in the 1990s Spider-Man animated series five-part episode, \\"Six Forgotten Warriors\\", voiced by Kathy Garver. This depiction of Miss America is one of five individuals, along with the Black Marvel, the Destroyer, the Thunderer, and the Whizzer, who got their powers as the result of an attempt at recreating the process that empowered Captain America and could activate them using a special ring. * The Madeline Joyce version of Miss America makes a cameo appearance in the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"S.H.I.E.L.D.

The railway's name comes from the former Hudson's Bay Company fort, Fort Shepherd, on the bank of the Columbia River on the United States border, even though the spelling is different. The N&FS; connected the city of Nelson with the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border at Waneta, near Trail. The line was acquired by the Great Northern Railway in 1898. History The railway was built by Daniel Chase Corbin, an American financier. In 1888, he built north from Spokane, Washington with his Spokane Falls and Northern Railway (SF&N;) to Little Dalles (near modern Northport) in the United States by 1890. The British Columbia government initially resisted granting him a charter to build across the border into Canada because they were concerned the railway would only be a feeder railway to the American interests in Spokane, especially the Great Northern Railway. However, in 1891 Corbin persuaded the provincial legislature to pass a private act incorporating the Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway,An Act to incorporate the Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Company, SBC 1891, c. 58. by promising to connect the railway to the coast and by using a group of Canadian businessmen as a front for the railway. With the Columbia and Kootenay Steam Navigation Company providing boat access along the Columbia River to his railway he had indirect access to the rich mining areas of the Kootenays. Concerned with this development, the Canadian Pacific Railway reacted by building the Columbia and Kootenay Railway (C&K;) between Robson (near Castlegar) and Nelson in 1891 along the unnavigable section of the Kootenay River between Kootenay Lake and the Arrow Lakes. In 1893, Corbin received a charter from the Canadian government, declaring it to be a work for the greater advantage of Canada and transferring the railway corporation to federal jurisdiction.An Act respecting the Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Company, SC 1893, c. 57 The connection to the coast was never built but the railway did reach Nelson in 1893. With an all rail route to the United States and direct access to the Great Northern, the N&FS; could provide more direct access to markets than the CPR could with its C&K.; Legacy The railway line was operated by a variety of corporate owners following the GN acquisition in 1898. The GN was merged into the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) in 1970. The creation of the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) in 1996 saw the N&FS; receive its third change in ownership. The track was gradually abandoned south from Nelson to Salmo during the 1990s. The only significant traffic source on the line is related to the forestry industry in the form of wood products. The abandoned section from Salmo to Nelson has been acquired by the provincial government and converted to the Salmo-Troup Rail Trail. Route Map showing Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway From south to north, the railway was a branch of the Spokane Falls and Northern Railroad and started at the United States border on the Columbia River at Waneta, and crossed a 500-foot bridge over the Pend d'Oreille River that still stands. The railway climbed out of the Columbia Valley past the community of Fruitvale to Salmo. From Salmo, the railway went north up the Salmo River valley to Ymir and then began the descent to Kootenay Lake. The line passed Nelson to the east as it descends along the hillside. It reaches lake level at Troup Junction (also known as File Mile Point), about 6 km east of Nelson and returned at lake level to the city. When the Canadian Pacific Railway built along Kootenay Lake in 1900, the section between Nelson and Troup Junction was sold to the CPR and GN was given trackage rights.

The trademark owner, Don Campbell, Inc.,United States Patent and Trademark Office Trademark Application and Registration Retrieval (TARR). claims benefits far beyond improving spatio-temporal reasoning or raising intelligence, defining the mark as \\"an inclusive term signifying the transformational powers of music in health, education, and well-being.\\" The term was first coined by Alfred A. Tomatis who used Mozart's music as the listening stimulus in his work attempting to cure a variety of disorders. The approach has been popularized in Don Campbell's book, The Mozart Effect, which is based on an experiment published in Nature suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted scores on one portion of the IQ test. As a result, the United States' Governor of Georgia, Zell Miller, proposed a budget to provide every child born in Georgia with a CD of classical music. Because of bad methodology in the first experiment and lack of replication, the Mozart effect is now believed to be a myth. Alfred A. Tomatis The concept of the \\"Mozart effect\\" was described by French researcher Dr. Alfred A. Tomatis in his 1991 book Pourquoi Mozart? (Why Mozart?). He used the music of Mozart in his efforts to \\"retrain\\" the ear, and believed that listening to the music presented at differing frequencies helped the ear, and promoted healing and the development of the brain. Rauscher et al. 1993 study Frances Rauscher, Gordon Shaw, and Catherine Ky (1993) investigated the effect of listening to music by Mozart on spatial reasoning, and the results were published in Nature. They gave research participants one of three standard tests of abstract spatial reasoning after they had experienced each of three listening conditions: the Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448 by Mozart, verbal relaxation instructions, and silence. They found a temporary enhancement of spatial- reasoning, as measured by spatial-reasoning sub tasks of the Stanford-Binet IQ test. Rauscher et al. show that the enhancing effect of the music condition is only temporary: no student had effects extending beyond the 15-minute period in which they were tested. The study makes no statement of an increase in IQ in general (because IQ was never measured). Popularization While Rauscher et al. only showed an increase in \\"spatial intelligence\\", the results were popularly interpreted as an increase in general IQ. This misconception, and the fact that the music used in the study was by Mozart, had an obvious appeal to those who valued this music; the Mozart effect was thus widely reported. In 1994, New York Times music columnist Alex Ross wrote in a light-hearted article, \\"researchers [Rauscher and Shaw] have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter\\", and presented this as the final piece of evidence that Mozart has dethroned Beethoven as \\"the world's greatest composer. \\" A 1997 Boston Globe article mentioned some of the Rauscher and Shaw results. It described one study in which three- and four-year-olds who were given eight months of private piano lessons scored 30% higher on tests of spatio-temporal reasoning than control groups given computer lessons, singing lessons, and no training. The 1997 book by Don Campbell, The Mozart Effect: Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit, discusses the theory that listening to Mozart (especially the piano concertos) may temporarily increase one's IQ and produce many other beneficial effects on mental function. Campbell recommends playing specially selected classical music to infants, in the expectation that it will benefit their mental development. After The Mozart Effect, Campbell wrote a follow-up book, The Mozart Effect For Children, and created related products. Among these are collections of music that he states harness the Mozart effect to enhance \\"deep rest and rejuvenation\\", \\"intelligence and learning\\", and \\"creativity and imagination\\". Campbell defines the term as \\"an inclusive term signifying the transformational powers of music in health, education, and well-being. It represents the general use of music to reduce stress, depression, or anxiety; induce relaxation or sleep; activate the body; and improve memory or awareness. Innovative and experimental uses of music and sound can improve listening disorders, dyslexia, attention deficit disorder, autism, and other mental and physical disorders and diseases\\". These theories are controversial. The relationship of sound and music (both played and listened to) for cognitive function and various physiological metrics has been explored in studies with no definitive results. Political impact The political impact of the theory was demonstrated on January 13, 1998, when Zell Miller, governor of Georgia, announced that his proposed state budget would include $105,000 a year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. Miller stated \\"No one questions that listening to music at a very early age affects the spatial-temporal reasoning that underlies math and engineering and even chess.\\" Miller played legislators some of Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy\\" on a tape recorder and asked \\"Now, don't you feel smarter already?\\" Miller asked Yoel Levi, music director of the Atlanta Symphony, to compile a collection of classical pieces that should be included. State representative Homer DeLoach said \\"I asked about the possibility of including some Charlie Daniels or something like that, but they said they thought the classical music has a greater positive impact. Having never studied those impacts too much, I guess I'll just have to take their word for that.\\"  Subsequent research and meta-analyses  While some supportive reports have been published, studies with positive results have tended to be associated with any form of music that has energetic and positive emotional qualities. Moreover, the intellectual benefits of enhanced mood and arousal are not restricted to spatial-temporal reasoning, but extend to speed of processing and creative problem solving. Among children, some studies suggest no effect on IQ or spatial ability, whereas others suggest that the effect can be elicited with energetic popular music that the children enjoy. The weight of subsequent evidence supports either a null effect, or short-term effects related to increases in mood and arousal, with mixed results published after the initial report in Nature. In 1999 a major challenge was raised to the existence of the Mozart effect by two teams of researchers. In a pair of papers published together under the title \\"Prelude or Requiem for the 'Mozart Effect'?\\" Chabris reported a meta-analysis demonstrating that \\"any cognitive enhancement is small and does not reflect any change in IQ or reasoning ability in general, but instead derives entirely from performance on one specific type of cognitive task and has a simple neuropsychological explanation\\", called \\"enjoyment arousal\\". For example, he cites a study that found that \\"listening either to Mozart or to a passage from a Stephen King story enhanced subjects' performance in paper folding and cutting (one of the tests frequently employed by Rauscher and Shaw) but only for those who enjoyed what they heard\\". Steele et. al. found that \\"listening to Mozart produced a 3-point increase relative to silence in one experiment and a 4-point decrease in the other experiment\\". In another study, the effect was replicated with the original Mozart music, but eliminated when the tempo was slowed down and major chords were replaced by minor chords. Another meta-analysis by Pietschnig, Voracek, and Formann (2010) combined results of 39 studies to answer the question as to whether or not the Mozart Effect exists. They concluded that there is little evidence to support the Mozart effect, as shown by small effect sizes. However, the most striking finding in this meta-analysis is the significantly larger effects published in studies affiliated with Rauscher or Rideout, with effect sizes more than three times higher for published studies affiliated with these founding members of the Mozart Effect. These systematic moderating effects due to lab affiliation call into question the existence of a Mozart Effect. In addition, this study also found strong evidence supporting a confounding publication bias when effect sizes of samples who listened to Mozart are compared to samples not exposed to a stimulus. Despite implementing Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky's (1995) suggestions of three key components that must be present to replicate the Mozart Effect, McCutcheon (2000) still failed to reproduce the Mozart Effect in a study with 36 adults. These conditions were: to ensure a task that taps into spatial components of mental imagery; a research design that does not include a pretest to avoid ceiling effects; a musical composition that is complex rather than repetitive and simple. Regardless of listening to classical music, jazz or silence, the study did not yield a significant effect on spatial reasoning performance. The Mozart Effect is likely just an artifact of arousal and heightened mood. Arousal is the confounding variable that mediates the relationship between spatial ability and music that defines the Mozart Effect. The \\"neural resonance\\" theory of Rauscher and colleagues which contends that Mozart's music primes the neural pathways of spatial reasoning has been widely criticized. Government bodies also became involved in analysing the wealth (some 300+ articles as of 2005) of reports. A German report concluded, for instance, that \\"... passively listening to Mozart ‚Äî or indeed any other music you enjoy ‚Äî does not make you smarter. But more studies should be done to find out whether music lessons could raise your child's IQ in the long term\\". Popular presentations of the \\"Mozart effect\\", including Alex Ross's comment that \\"listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter\\" and Zell Miller's \\"don't you feel smarter\\" query to the Georgia legislature, almost always tie it to \\"intelligence.\\" Rauscher, one of the original researchers, has disclaimed this idea. In a 1999 reply to an article challenging the effect, published along with the article, she wrote (emphasis added): On efforts like Miller's budget proposal, and the press attention surrounding the effect, Rauscher has said, \\"I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on music education programs.\\"Goode, Erica (1999), \\"Mozart For Baby? Some Say, Maybe Not\\". The New York Times, 1999-08-03 p. f1: Rauscher, \\"the money could be better spent on music education programs.\\" Many scholars in the psychological community now view the claim that playing classical music to children can boost their intelligence to be a \\"myth.\\" Emory University psychologist Scott Lilienfeld ranks Mozart Effect as number six in his book 50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology. =Health benefits= Music has been evaluated to see if it has other properties. The April 2001 edition of Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine assessed the possible health benefits of the music of Mozart. John Jenkins played Sonata K.448 to patients with epilepsy and found a decrease in epileptiform activity. According to the British Epilepsy Organization, research has suggested that apart from Mozart's K.448 and Piano Concerto No. 23 (K. 488), only one other piece of music has been found to have a similar effect; a song by the Greek composer Yanni, entitled \\"Acroyali/Standing in Motion\\" (version from Yanni Live at the Acropolis performed at the Acropolis). It was determined to have the \\"Mozart effect\\", by the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine because it was similar to Mozart's K.448 in tempo, structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability. Other uses of Mozart's music While it is clear that exposure to Mozart does not raise IQ, studies of the effects of music have explored as diverse areas as its links to seizure onset or research in animals suggesting that even exposure in-utero in rats improves their maze learning The original claim continues to influence public life. For instance a German sewage treatment plant plays Mozart music to break down the waste faster, reports the UK Guardian. Anton Stucki, chief operator of the Treuenbrietzen plant was quoted as saying, \\"We think the secret is in the vibrations of the music, which penetrate everything‚Äîincluding the water, the sewage and the cells.\\" See also * Psychoacoustics * Baby Einstein * Significance of music education References External links *\\"\\"Mozart's music does not make you smarter, study finds\\", Science Daily, May 10, 2010 * Dowd, Will.

Lake City encompasses much of the Thornton Creek watershed, the focus of a long restoration campaign by citizens and Seattle Public Utilities staff to enhance the residential environment of Lake City.  History  Meadowbrook Pond in Lake City Lake City Mini Park at the southwest corner of Lake City Way NE and 125th Street NE preserves the entrance of a branch of Seafirst Bank (now absorbed into the Bank of America. What is now Lake City has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE--10,000 years ago).

The lake people lost their rights in 1854. The Lake City area was clearcut by crude wagon road or by using Lake Washington, from 1850 to around the start of the 20th century, more rapidly with the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (c. 1886) providing easy access along what is now the Burke-Gilman Trail adjacent to the lake. Wetlands were drained. A Little Germany neighborhood of several immigrant farmers grew up in the 1870s around where Nathan Hale High School now stands.Wilma The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway operated a passenger stop near the current location of NE 115th St called simply, \\"Lake\\". The area was dubbed Lake City by D.H. and R.H. Lee in 1906 after they purchased and platted the land. With the advent of the automobile, the area developed linearly around major roads rather than centrally around trolley stops, as in older Seattle neighborhoods. The road to Bothell and Everett was made all-weather with brick in 1918 and then the new material asphalt in 1928. The automobile relationship with Seattle would shape Lake City development and neighborhood character. Lake City would remain relatively remote and suburban from Seattle until years after WWII. Transition to a neighborhood community was marked in 1935 with the start of the Lake City Branch Library of today as a few shelves of books in part of a room in Lake City School, shared with the WPA. Sponsorship was by the Pacific Improvement Club community group. Lake City incorporated as a township in 1949 with more than 40,000 residents; rapid growth was a product of a massive influx of young suburban families after World War II. The City of Seattle annexed Lake City and other communities in 1954 when the city limits were expanded from 85th Street to 145th Street.(1) Wilma, (5 December 2002, Essay 4031) (2) Phelps, Chapter 15, \\"Annexation\\", pp. 216-224, map \\"to 1975\\" p. 224, map key table pp.222-3; as well as Wilma (Essay 3449) Scout Troop 240 and other volunteers moved thousands of books into a new library building in 1955.Wilma, (5 December 2002, Essay 4031) Lake City relies heavily on retail commerce, and business in the area has risen and fallen based on highway expansion in the Seattle area. The expansion of Aurora Avenue North to Everett, Washington cut into business in the 1920s, but Lake City revived after NE 130th Street was paved. The opening of Northgate Mall in 1950 reduced retail business in Lake City, and the area took another hit after the construction of Interstate 5 in the 1960s. Renovation of the city core along Lake City Way NE near NE 125th Street helped revive the local economy in the late 1970s.  The Jolly Roger and the Coon Chicken Inn  Ying's Drive-In on the former site of the Coon Chicken Inn, 2015. In 1916, Washington joined Prohibition, and Lake City saw an upswing in commercial activity. Unincorporated areas of King County accessible by auto became popular locations for speakeasies selling illegal liquor and purveying prostitution and gambling, often in clever guises. One remarkable structure among numerous establishments half a mile south of Lake City was the China Castle, later the Jolly Roger, having a unique tower from which a watchman signaled the approach of police, visible from miles away. In the event of a raid, patrons and employees could leave via tunnels such as one under the highway, easily dispersing via the wooded ravine on the other side. The Jolly Roger continued as a popular dancehall and restaurant. It was designated a Seattle Historic Landmark in 1979. On 19 October 1989, the restaurant, located at 8721 Lake City Way (formerly Bothell Way) burned in an arson fire. The fire was somewhat suspicious, but only relative to its storied past.Stein Police had neither motive nor suspects. Investigators were not able to determine how the arsonist got inside past a burglar alarm, with no signs of forced entry. At the time, the building had just been purchased the week before from the previous owner, with whom the buyer was entangled in legal and financial red tape. The previous owner was in the building removing his possessions the day before the fire. When firefighters arrived hours after the fire had begun in the basement, a man directed them. He seemed so sure of where the fire began that they assumed he was an employee. After the fire was extinguished, the man could not be found. The owners stated that he was not an employee.Merritt One year after the fire, preservation activists sought to have the structure rebuilt. Before their efforts got off the ground, the building was hastily demolished on 11 January 1991, obviating its appeal. A modern oil company-owned convenience store and gas station now stands on the location. Within view, slightly south of the former Jolly Roger site, on the south side of Lake City Way, Ying's Drive-In sits on the site of a former Coon Chicken Inn. For nearly three decades, beginning in 1929, the Coon Chicken Inn sold southern-style food in a restaurant whose themes drew heavily on light- hearted, overtly racist stereotypes akin to blackface or the iconic Sambo's on Aurora Avenue N. The original restaurant in Santa Barbara, remains.  Lake City today  Rekhi Building on the northeast corner of Lake City Way NE and 125th Street NE, in the heart of Lake City, 2015.

It depicts Ophelia, a character from William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, singing before she drowns in a river in Denmark. The work encountered a mixed response when first exhibited at the Royal Academy, but has since come to be admired as one of the most important works of the mid-nineteenth century for its beauty, its accurate depiction of a natural landscape, and its influence on artists from John William Waterhouse and Salvador Dal√≠ to Peter Blake and Ed Ruscha. Theme and elements The painting depicts Ophelia singing while floating in a river just before she drowns. The scene is described in Act IV, Scene VII of Hamlet in a speech by Queen Gertrude.\\"Millais Ophelia: Behind the painting\\". Retrieved on 16 January 2008. John Everett Millais in 1865, by Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) The episode depicted is not usually seen onstage, as in Shakespeare's text it exists only in Gertrude's description. Out of her mind with grief, Ophelia has been making garlands of wildflowers. She climbs into a willow tree overhanging a brook to dangle some from its branches, and a bough breaks beneath her. She lies in the water singing songs, as if unaware of her danger (\\"incapable of her own distress\\"). Her clothes, trapping air, have allowed her to temporarily stay afloat (\\"Her clothes spread wide, / And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up.\\"). But eventually, \\"her garments, heavy with their drink, / Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay\\" down \\"to muddy death\\". Ophelia's death has been praised as one of the most poetically written death scenes in literature.For one example of praise see The Works of Shakespeare, in 11 volumes (Hamlet in volume 10), edited by Henry N. Hudson, published by James Munroe and Company, 1856: ‚ÄúThis exquisite passage is deservedly celebrated. Nothing could better illustrate the Poet's power to make the description of a thing better than the thing itself, by giving us his eyes to see it with.‚Äù Ophelia's pose‚Äîher open arms and upwards gaze‚Äîalso resembles traditional portrayals of saints or martyrs, but has also been interpreted as erotic. The painting is known for its depiction of the detailed flora of the river and the riverbank, stressing the patterns of growth and decay in a natural ecosystem. Despite its nominal Danish setting, the landscape has come to be seen as quintessentially English. Ophelia was painted along the banks of the Hogsmill River in Surrey, near Tolworth. Barbara Webb, a resident of nearby Old Malden, devoted much time to finding the exact placement of the picture, and according to her research, the scene is located at Six Acre Meadow, alongside Church Road, Old Malden. For a description of Webb's findings, see . \\"Mystery of location of Millais' Ophelia solved\\", The Daily Telegraph Millais Road is now nearby. Millais' close colleague William Holman Hunt was at the time working on his The Hireling Shepherd nearby.. Study for the painting, 1852 The flowers shown floating on the river were chosen to correspond with Shakespeare's description of Ophelia's garland. They also reflect the Victorian interest in the \\"language of flowers\\", according to which each flower carries a symbolic meaning. The prominent red poppy‚Äînot mentioned by Shakespeare's description of the scene‚Äîrepresents sleep and death.Millais's Ophelia. Tate Gallery Online. Retrieved on 16 January 2007. At an early stage in the painting's creation, Millais painted a water vole‚Äîwhich an assistant had fished out of the Hogsmill‚Äîpaddling next to Ophelia. In December 1851, he showed the unfinished painting to Holman Hunt's relatives. He recorded in his diary, \\"Hunt's uncle and aunt came, both of whom understood most gratifyingly every object except my water rat. The male relation, when invited to guess at it, eagerly pronounced it to be a hare. Perceiving by our smiles that he had made a mistake, a rabbit was then hazarded. After which I have a faint recollection of a dog or a cat being mentioned.\\" Millais painted the water vole out of the final picture, although a rough sketch of it still exists in an upper corner of the canvas hidden by its frame. In keeping with the tenets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (PRB), of which he was a member, Millais used bright colours, gave high attention to detail and faithful truth to nature. This rendition of Ophelia is the epitome of the PRB style; first, because of the subject matter, depicting a woman who has lived a life awaiting happiness, only to find her destiny on the verge of death: the vulnerable woman is a popular subject among Pre-Raphaelite artists. Also, Millais utilizes bright, intense colours in the landscape to make the pale Ophelia contrast with the nature behind her. All this is evident in the vivid attention to detail in the brush and trees around Ophelia, the contouring of her face, and the intricate work Millais did on her dress. Painting process An 1854 self-portrait by Elizabeth Siddal, who acted as Millais' model for Ophelia.Elkan, Jenny. \\"Elizabeth Eleanor Siddal\\". Tate Gallery. Retrieved on 16 January 2007. Millais produced Ophelia in two separate stages: He first painted the landscape, and secondly the figure of Ophelia. Having found a suitable setting for the picture, Millais remained on the banks of the Hogsmill River in Ewell‚Äîwithin a literal stone's throw of where fellow Pre- Raphaelite William Holman Hunt painted The Light of the World‚Äîfor up to 11 hours a day, six days a week, over a five-month period in 1851. This allowed him to accurately depict the natural scene before him. Millais encountered various difficulties during the painting process. He wrote in a letter to a friend, \\"The flies of Surrey are more muscular, and have a still greater propensity for probing human flesh. I am threatened with a notice to appear before a magistrate for trespassing in a field and destroying the hay ... and am also in danger of being blown by the wind into the water. Certainly the painting of a picture under such circumstances would be greater punishment to a murderer than hanging.\\" By November 1851, the weather had turned windy and snowy. Millais oversaw the building of a hut \\"made of four hurdles,A hurdle is \\"a portable panel usually of wattled withes and stakes used especially for enclosing land or livestock\\": . like a sentry-box, covered outside with straw\\". According to Millais, sitting inside the hut made him feel like Robinson Crusoe. William Holman Hunt was so impressed by the hut that he had an identical one built for himself. Ophelia was modelled by artist and muse Elizabeth Siddal, then 19 years old. Millais had Siddal lie fully clothed in a full bathtub in his studio at 7 Gower Street in London.A blue plaque identifies the building as the place where \\"The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in 1848\\". As it was now winter, he placed oil lamps under the tub to warm the water, but was so intent on his work that he allowed them to go out. As a result, Siddal caught a severe cold, and her father later sent Millais a letter demanding ¬£50 for medical expenses. According to Millais' son, he eventually accepted a lower sum.J.G. Millais, Life and Letters of John Everett Millais, vol 1, p.154 Reception When Ophelia was first publicly exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1852, it was not universally acclaimed. A critic in The Times wrote that \\"there must be something strangely perverse in an imagination which souses Ophelia in a weedy ditch, and robs the drowning struggle of that lovelorn maiden of all pathos and beauty\\",The Times, Saturday, 1 May 1852; pg. 8; Issue 21104: Exhibition of the Royal Academy -(Private View) while a further review in the same newspaper said that \\"Mr. Millais's Ophelia in her pool ... makes us think of a dairymaid in a frolic\\". Even the great art critic John Ruskin, an avid supporter of Millais, while finding the technique of the painting \\"exquisite\\", expressed doubts about the decision to set it in a Surrey landscape and asked, \\"Why the mischief should you not paint pure nature, and not that rascally wirefenced garden-rolled- nursery-maid's paradise?\\"James, William (ed.) \\"The Order of Release: The Story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais\\". New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1947, p. 176. In the 20th century, Salvador Dal√≠ wrote glowingly in an article published in a 1936 edition of the French Surrealist journal Minotaure about the artistic movement that inspired the painting. \\"How could Salvador Dal√≠ fail to be dazzled by the flagrant surrealism of English Pre-Raphaelitism. The Pre-Raphaelite painters bring us radiant women who are, at the same time, the most desirable and most frightening that exist.\\" He later went on to re-interpret Millais' painting in a 1973 work entitled Ophelia's Death. In 1906, Japanese novelist Natsume S≈çseki called the painting \\"a thing of considerable beauty\\" in one of his novels; since then, the painting has been highly popular in Japan. It was exhibited in Tokyo in 1998 and travelled there again in 2008. Influence The painting has been widely referred to and pastiched in art, film. and photography, notably in Laurence Olivier's Hamlet where it formed the basis for the portrayal of Ophelia's death. A scene in Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left was modeled on the painting, while the video for Nick Cave's song \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow\\" depicts Kylie Minogue mimicking the pose of the image.Radenburg, Katja, Ik Ophelia, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, 2008. The artwork is also referenced in Fire With Fire, a 1986 film in which a schoolgirl is replicating the central image as the protagonists meet. The imagery of the painting is evoked in the prologue of Lars von Trier's Melancholia, where Kirsten Dunst's character Justine floats in a slow-moving stream. Provenance and valuation Ophelia was purchased from Millais on 10 December 1851 by the art dealer Henry Farrer for 300 guineas, approximately equal to ¬£40,000 in 2020. Farrer sold the painting to B.G. Windus, an avid collector of Pre-Raphaelite art, who sold it on in 1862 for 748 guineas. The painting is held at Tate Britain, London, and is valued by experts as worth at least ¬£30 million.

VisionTV is currently owned by ZoomerMedia, a company controlled by Moses Znaimer. VisionTV's funding comes from cable subscription fees, viewer donations, advertising revenues and the sale of airtime to faith groups. History and viewership Licensed in December 1987 by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the channel was launched on September 1, 1988 under the ownership of a nonprofit organization that eventually evolved into S-VOX. It was initially one of Canada's more popular cable channels. However, with the proliferation of new cable channels, it has been moved up the dial by carriers and become less available to audiences, causing a drop in its viewership. VisionTV lacked clout with cable carriers as it was then a one-channel operation owned by a not-for-profit organization rather than a large commercial entity operating many channels. Notably, Rogers Cable was criticized in 1997 for moving Vision to Channel 59 on its Toronto system, rendering it inaccessible to many apartment residents because 59 is the channel most commonly overridden by the lobby camera service in apartment buildings. After Vision protested, Rogers offered to put Vision on channel 78 as well, but Vision turned that down because many of its viewers' sets can't reach that far.Lorna Dueck, \\"Me TV Bumps God Up The Dial\\", Crossroads Christian Communications, October 1997. Network vice-president Rita Deverell, who hosted interstitial segments between programs, was the network's most prominent on-air personality from its launch until she left in 2002 to work for APTN. Some evangelical Christian denominations view the station as liberal in orientation, and thus prefer more evangelically oriented operations such as the Crossroads Television System (CTS). In June 2009, S-VOX announced it would sell its broadcasting assets to ZoomerMedia, a company controlled by Moses Znaimer.VisionTV Board agrees to ZoomerMedia purchase of television properties, VisionTV press release, June 15, 2009 The sale was approved by the CRTC on March 30, 2010.http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2010/2010-193.htm ZoomerMedia assumed control of S-VOX's broadcasting assets on June 30, 2010.ZoomerMedia Limited Completes Acquisitions and Financing In December 2010, ZoomerMedia introduced a new logo and on-air identity for the channel with the tagline, \\"Zoomer Television\\" (Zoomer being a word coined by Znaimer meaning \\"boomers with zip\\"), emphasizing its focus on more general entertainment programming for the 45 and older demographic. In August 2013, the Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) denied Vision's application to continue mandatory carriage which had required all Canadian cable systems to carry the channel. Programming 120px VisionTV's programming consists of two programming streams; Mosaic and Cornerstone. =Mosaic= Its Mosaic block consists of faith related programming representing 75 faith groups within various religious denominations, including Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus. While the station sells time to several television evangelists, most of its Christian programming tends to originate from more mainstream denominations such as the United Church of Canada and the Catholic Church - although United Church of Canada stopped producing its weekly program in 2008 due to a poor time slot, high costs of airtime and lack of viewership. =Cornerstone= VisionTV's Cornerstone programs include music, feature films, dramas, comedies, documentaries and programming on social issues that explore spirituality, morality, and cultural diversity as well as other general entertainment programming. The network also sponsors an annual Canadian drama competition, which solicits television series proposals revolving around faith and cultural diversity and then funds a pilot episode for the winning proposal. Two noted Canadian series, Lord Have Mercy! and Da Kink in My Hair, have been developed from pilots commissioned by VisionTV.

The text of the play was written as a \\"com√©die lyrique\\" in one act, February‚ÄìMarch 1913. In June of the same year Satie added the music, a set of seven little dances, originally composed for piano. The first printed edition of the text of the play in 1921 contained 3 cubist woodcut engravings by Georges Braque. The piano version of the music was first published in 1929, a few years after the composer's death. The orchestral score was not published until 40 years later. The play The comically surrealist plot involves the elderly (and very confused) Baron M√©duse (his name means Medusa in French), his daughter Frisette (to whom the Baron actually refers as his \\"fille de lait\\", which would imply that the Baron was Frisette's wet-nurse), Frisette's young suitor Astolpho, and the Baron's recalcitrant valet Polycarpe. There is also a mechanical monkey, named Jonas, dancing to the intermittent music. The nine scenes of the play develop as a funny succession of non sequiturs and misunderstandings, ending in an amicable hug of the protagonists. The play was privately staged a few months after its completion, in the salons of the parents of Roland-Manuel, who played Baron M√©duse's role. Later live performances of the play would become rare, although a notable one, in an English translation by M. C. Richards, took place in the summer of 1948 at Black Mountain College in North Carolina: John Cage suggested the project and played the music; Buckminster Fuller played the role of the Baron Medusa; Merce Cunningham danced the part of the mechanical monkey; Willem de Kooning designed the set and Elaine de Kooning played Frisette; and the play was directed by Arthur Penn. In 2005, a production using this English translation was presented in Asheville, North Carolina, in a collaboration between the Black Mountain College Museum and Arts Center and North Carolina Stage Company. A German-language adaption by Berlin State Opera artistic director J√ºrgen Flimm premiered on the workshop stage of the Schiller Theater in Berlin in 2011 under the title \\"Wissen Sie, wie man T√∂ne reinigt? Satiesfactionen.\\" Several recordings, generally in French and including the music, were published. English translations are available in print.Erik Satie, The Ruse of Medusa : round revue Several 20th century recordings of the play feature Pierre Bertin in M√©duse's role. When this actor rehearsed the 1921 first public performance of the play, Satie was upset, as he disapproved of Bertin's rendering of the play's main character with Satie's mannerisms and voice (Orledge 1995, p124). The music The musical score is a series of very short dances in popular modes (quadrille, waltz, mazurka, polka, etc.), written in Satie's most humorously straight-faced manner, and reminiscent of some of Satie's other works ‚Äì the waltz, for example, is a slightly more \\"mechanical\\" version of the music reappearing a year later in his Trois valses distingu√©es du pr√©cieux d√©gout√©. At the private premiere of the Pi√®ge, Satie, performing the music, had slid sheets of paper between the strings of the piano for a more mechanical sound. This was supposedly the first appearance of a prepared piano in the history of music. At the 1921 public premiere, Darius Milhaud conducted an orchestra composed of a small string section, some wind instruments and percussion, performing Satie's orchestral version of the music. Satie never had an easy relation towards orchestral music (at least according to his contemporaries), consequently also this orchestration was criticised for showing Satie's limitations in this medium. Satie, however, had probably the limited sound of mechanical music in mind for the seven \\"toutes petites dances\\" of the Pi√®ge. The surrealism Satie wrote his absurdist play some 15 years after Jarry's first Ubu play had been premiered in Paris. Ubu Roi was later to become the most cherished and first example of surrealism in theatre (which would develop into the Theatre of the Absurd). Apart from the Pi√®ge, Satie had contributed to that emergence of absurdist theatre by publishing a text regarding his theatrical vision as one of his M√©moires d'un amn√©sique in January 1913, in the Revue musicale SIM. The article was entitled Choses de th√©√¢tre.

New York City is seen in the distance. Berry's Creek (sometimes referred to as Berrys Creek or Berry Creek) is a tributary of the Hackensack River in the New Jersey Meadowlands in Bergen County, New Jersey. The creek watershed contains a diverse array of wetlands, marshes, and wildlife. The creek runs through a densely populated region and has been subject to extensive industrial pollution during the 19th and 20th centuries. Several companies discharged toxic chemicals into the creek in the 20th century, and these chemicals have remained in the sediment. The creek has the highest concentrations of methyl mercury of any fresh-water sediment in the world. Portions of the creek watershed are Superfund sites and cleanup projects began in the late 20th century. History The creek is named for Major John Berry, an early British settler and Deputy Governor of New Jersey. Settlement of New Jersey by European colonists began in the 17th century. Increasing settlements in the early 19th century were accompanied by human alterations to the land in the Hackensack meadowlands, such as clearing forests; building roads, railroads and ditches; and filling wetlands. The Second Industrial Revolution led to construction of heavy manufacturing, storage tanks, and chemical processing plants in the area during the late 19th & early 20th centuries. Upland areas in the Berry's Creek watershed were developed by 1900. In the 1930s municipal sewage discharges began to contribute significant amount of pollutants to the creek and the Hackensack River. (All sewage pipes to the creek were removed by the 1990s.) Urbanization in the region intensified after World War II, with the expansion of roads and highways, including the New Jersey Turnpike (1952), as well as the Meadowlands Sports Complex (1970s). Tide gates were installed in the 1960s to control flooding, and these installations altered the water levels and flows, which consequently altered the ecosystem. The filling of wetlands during the 20th century amounted to a 63% loss of wetlands in the watershed. Course Berry's Creek is largely a tidal estuary, along with the Hackensack River. It rises at the East and West Riser Ditches in Teterboro, some of which is within the bounds of Teterboro Airport. The main channel of the creek runs for , winding through Moonachie and Carlstadt. In East Rutherford, the creek forms the western boundary at Walden Marsh, of the Meadowlands Sports Complex. Additional portions of the creek are located in Wood-Ridge. Continuing under Route 3, the creek divides into the creek mainstem and Berry's Creek Canal. The canal was built in 1911, and runs in a straight line through East Rutherford to the Hackensack River. The creek mainstem enters Rutherford and then forms the boundary between Rutherford and Lyndhurst until it reaches the Hackensack. Watershed The Berry's Creek watershed is , which includes of tidal waterways and marshes and of highly-developed upland areas. Within the watershed are many commercial and light industrial sites, portions of the sports complex, several closed landfills, and many roads and highways. Walden Marsh was built in the 1980s adjacent to the sports complex, as part of environmental mitigation for flood prevention measures that were installed. By 2000, 30 such structures existed along the Hackensack confluence.ERDC, HMDC & USACE - NYD, Flood Control Survey 2000 performed by HMD.  Pollution and remediation Map of mercury concentrations in surface sediment of Berry's Creek Berry‚Äôs Creek has been subject to extensive industrial pollution during the 19th and 20th centuries. = Ventron/Velsicol site = F.W. Berk and Company, a chemical processing firm in Wood-Ridge and Carlstadt, discharged untreated waste, including mercury, into the creek between 1929 and 1960. In 1960 Berk sold its property to Wood Ridge Chemical Corporation, a subsidiary of Velsicol Chemical Corporation, and the waste discharges continued. In the 1960s the New Jersey Department of Health conducted tests of the plant effluent, although the principal focus at that time was conventional pollutants, for which there were well-established analytical testing methods. (Some wastewater samples were analyzed for mercury, however the results were negative due to the insensitivity of the test method employed.) In 1968 the plant was sold to Ventron, which continued operations, although the company also began to study the environmental impacts of its discharges. In 1970 the newly-established U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also began tests of the plant wastewater, and found there were daily discharges of two to four pounds of mercury into Berry's Creek. Neither the state nor EPA filed formal charges against the plant at that time. Plant operations ended in 1974, when Ventron sold the property to Robert M. Wolf, a real estate developer. In 1976, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP; successor to the Dept. of Health) filed a lawsuit against Ventron and other parties for violating the recently-enacted New Jersey Water Quality Improvement Act of 1971. The state enacted a new chemical spill law in 1977, the Spill Compensation and Control Act, and additional charges under this law were added to the lawsuit. In 1983 the New Jersey Supreme Court held that Ventron and Velsicol were jointly liable for the environmental damage. The creek has been measured as having the highest concentration, between 1 and 2 g per kg sample of methyl mercury of any fresh-water sediment in the world, the result being a total discharge of 268 tons of mercury-contaminated toxic waste into the creek between 1943 and 1974. Wolf had demolished the former Ventron plant in 1974, but the residual pollution remained in the creek, rendering the site still unsustainable. = EPA Superfund designations = The federal \\"Superfund\\" law was enacted by Congress in 1980 to provide for cleanup of hazardous waste sites, and was based on New Jersey‚Äôs 1977 spill cleanup law. EPA applied the new cleanup law in 1983 and 1984 as it designated the Ventron/Velsicol site and two nearby sites‚Äîthe Scientific Chemical site in Carlstadt, and the Universal Oil Products site in East Rutherford‚Äîas Superfund sites. EPA and NJDEP began detailed assessment and initial cleanup activities on these sites in the 1980s. Contaminated soil was removed and replaced at several properties in 1990, as an interim measure. but completion is projected to continue during the first quarter 21st century. In addition to mercury, all three sites are laden with PCBs. Only the Scientific Chemical site is listed as \\"under control\\" as of 2018. In October 2018 EPA announced a 5.5-year plan to remove and/or cap the toxic waste in the creek and watershed resulting from the Ventron/Velsicol site discharges. Wildlife Food web in Berry's Creek Through the early 1900s, the predominant plants in the watershed were freshwater species such as cattails and Atlantic white cedar. The plant composition began to change after construction of the Oradell Dam on the Hackensack River in 1921. The dam was built at the head of tide, which increased the salinity of Berry's Creek, and since then the marsh vegetation in has been composed predominately of Phragmites (Phragmites australis). Berry's Creek harbors the last remaining northern harrier nest site in the Meadowlands. It is heavily used by wintering raptors. \\"The marshes of the Meadowlands provide many important wetland functions. More than 265 species of birds use the area, and the Meadowlands is recognized as a major link along the Atlantic Flyway for migratory species (especially shorebirds) and an important overwintering area for a variety of waterfowl... Waterway-associated birds occurring in the region include a variety of shorebirds, wading birds, waterfowl, and gulls.\\" Significant fish species in the Meadowlands region are mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), white perch (Morone americana), Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), striped killifish (Fundulus majalis), and striped bass (Morone saxatilis). In November 1991 a water sample survey found high levels of the metallic element chromium in the hepatopancreas of the local blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) population.The data were collected at three locations on the Diamond Shamrock, Sawmill Creek, and Berry's Creek by The NJDEP has issued advisories warning against harvesting or eating blue crabs from Berry's Creek, the entire Hackensack River watershed and Newark Bay.

History pre-1900 The railway was chartered by a senior officer of the CPR and immediately leased for 999 years to the CPR. The CPR built the line to obtain mining traffic that was then being sent by boat along Kootenay Lake and south to the United States. By building along the unnavigable Kootenay River between Kootenay Lake and the Columbia River, the CPR used steamers to connect with its mainline at Revelstoke up the Arrow Lakes and the Columbia River. In 1891, the first train travelled between Nelson and Robson. Low water and ice on the Arrow Lakes made connecting route unreliable so in 1897, the CPR extended the railway up the Slocan Valley to Slocan City on the shore of Slocan Lake. Boats(?) and barges moved railway cars and goods to the north end of the lake which connected with its Nakusp and Slocan Railway which continued to Nakusp on the Arrow Lake much closer to its mainline at Revelstoke. This branch also provided a connection to the rich mining region around Sandon. History post-1900 The section of railway was later connected both east (along Kootenay Lake) and west, (via the Columbia and Western Railway) to become part of the CPR's southern mainline through British Columbia. After numerous abandonments in the region, this section of railway is active as a branch line connected at Cranbrook and terminating in Trail. The branch up the Slocan Valley was abandoned in 1993 and has been converted into a multiuse trail.

Behind the Glass was the first television reality show in Russia, where six men and women between the ages of 21 and 24 living together in a glass apartment, filmed by 26 cameras. One way mirrors allowed pedestrians to see into the bedroom, living room and bathroom. Security guards protected the glass. Fans were charged 20 roubles to look in on the show. Former NTV producer Grigory Luibomirov, producer and director of the show, created the reality series. \\"Reality TV arrived in Russia only in 2001, in the shape of the wildly popular \\"Behind the Glass\\".\\" Background According to TV-6, the original selection process for the reality show consisted of two stages. A group of psychologists, sociologists and doctors selected 12 people from several thousands, and then the audience selected the 6 winners. Six are considered \\"a reserve\\", in case one of the participants decides to leave before their time. \\"The participants that TV-6 chose for the show seem to be selected in such a way so as that no individual immediately emerges as the winner or audience favorite. One of the girls is very pretty, but highly hysterical. Another is relatively homily, but frequently goes to the shower to show her body off. The guys are pretty much the same - one is charming, but fairly nimble minded, the second guy is smart, but unattractive, and the third is attractive, but pretentious.\\" Popularity The television weekly Novaya Gazeta voted Behind the Glass the top program and top TV event of November 2001, as well as worst TV event of the month. Half of all Russian viewers watched the program. Millions of viewers logged on to the website, zasteklom.tv6.ru, which crashed frequently because of the heavy Internet traffic. First season The first season, launched on October 27, 2001, was filmed in the first floor of the Rossiya hotel in Moscow (which was torn down in March 2006). The ultra modern apartment was furnished by the show's sponsor, IKEA, a Swedish retailer, who opened its first superstore in Moscow in March 2000. During the 34-day first season, everyday around 3,000 curious Muscovites lined up to wait a half-hour to look for five minutes through the one-way mirror that opened onto the apartment. Costing over $1m, it was by far the most expensive TV show ever made in Russia. The series was so popular that TV6 aired the program three times a day, nearly doubling its network market share. Competitors could accept the highest Internet bid from viewers to oust someone from the house, one player accepted $5,400. The television show could also use their discretion to send players back into the house, even after they had been voted out. One contestant was voted out every week. The television show showed two females, Margarita and Olga naked in the shower, and two female contestants ran around the apartment semi-nude. This sparked angry letters to newspapers and heated talk show discussion. When Sasha got involved with Margarita in the shower, which took up the majority of the television episode, his girlfriend went on a talk show to voice her displeasure. Sasha left the show in an attempt to make up with his real-life girlfriend, stating that his relationship with his girlfriend was more important than winning an apartment. \\"The producers gave them each a fixed budget equivalent to an average Moscow salary, and as a group they can order groceries sent in. They have no access to television but are allowed video games and techno-rock on their headsets. Olga and Margarita dress in scanty clothes most of the time and sleep in their thong underwear, while Janna wears long-sleeved pajamas. All are required to work out once a day. They do their own cleanup when they feel like it. In the one nod to privacy, the omnipresent cameras never show them using the toilet.\\" The program season ended showing 63 seconds two contestants, Margarita and Maxim, having sex, filmed with infrared cameras. Videos of the season were on sale which showed footage that was not shown on television. The first season ended December 4, 2001. Two winners, \\"the pouty, dark-haired Janna, the one woman who refused to remove her clothes or engage in any sexual liaisons, and the proud, quiet Denis\\" received the top prizes of a year's free rent in an apartment in a prestigious Moscow district, worth around $25,000. Contenstants for season one included: * Sasha/Alexander (replaced by Anatoly) * Anatoly the circus performer; * Denis an advertising manager of Armenian descent; * Margarita a model; * Maxim a musician * Olga a 24-year-old strawberry-blond fitness instructor and lesbian; * Janna a student. Second season The second season, which began January 19, 2002, was called \\"Za Steklom: Posledny Bifsteks\\" \\"Behind the Glass: The Last Beef Steak\\". During this season TV6 was closed by Russian authorities in January 2002, but the production continued and the contestants decided to stay on, after being convinced that it wasn't a prank. The show broadcast switched to TNT channel and also continued to be broadcast over the internet. In the second season, the same week that the television station was closed down, the 12 participants opened two competing restaurants next to the apartment they were living in. Each six-member team was given 1 million rubles to start up a food business that anyone can visit for a cover charge of 300 to 500 rubles, which excludes the price of the food. A week later, viewers began to vote off participants until only one remained. The winner then got the chance to open his own restaurant. Third season From June 1, 2002 to July 6, 2002, after the TV6 staffers got a new license under the TVS logo, the third instalment of the series aired, called \\"Behind the Glass: You're in the Army Now.\\" Legal problems Endemol, the company that created the Big Brother concept demanded that TV6 pay a license fee, as do the other 20 networks around the world that air versions of Big Brother. TV-6 press representative Tatiana Blinova responded that Behind the Glass had nothing to do with Big Brother and that the idea for the show came to the director 12 years ago after reading a Russian literary classic, an anti-utopian, sci-fi novel We by Yevgeny Zamyatin in which people live in glass houses so everyone can see what everyone else is doing. Endemol then threatened to sue. Criticism Despite its popularity, Behind the Glass had its detractors. The youth group Moving Together, a Russian organization predominantly focused on clearing homes and libraries of \\"unhealthy books\\" conducted a letter-writing campaign against Behind the Glass. Russian lawmakers and veterans of the Union of Filmmakers argued the program was immoral. The Moscow Orthodox Patriarchy spokesman Father Vsevolod Chaplin wrote in an open letter to all national television networks: > \\"It is highly probable that participation in this program will have a long- > term negative impact on the personal development, family and intimate > relations of the young people who are behind the glass. The program is > rather loose, given that it is watched by children and teenagers. It has > elements that depreciate a person's privacy, erode the holiness of marriage > and the ideal of relations between men and women.\\" A survey conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Poll Center in 2005 revealed that 82 percent of Russians favored censorship on television, an increase of 19% from the same poll a year before. One in seven Russians drew attention to the nature of programs like the talk-show Windows and the reality programs Home 2 or Behind the glass.

Pinafore (D'Oyly Carte, 1960) Reed joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1951 as the understudy to Peter Pratt, who had recently become the principal comedian of the company.Stone, David. John Reed, Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 13 February 2010 At the time of his audition, he knew little or nothing about Gilbert and Sullivan, but company manager, Frederic Lloyd, assured him that the company preferred this so that they could \\"start you off in the way we mean you to go\\". The company performed 48 weeks per year, mostly on tour, usually with winter seasons in London.Joseph (1994), pp. 160 et seq. Reed appeared in the chorus and was given several smaller roles: Associate (1952‚Äì55) in Trial by Jury, Major Murgatroyd in Patience (1952‚Äì59), Second Citizen in The Yeomen of the Guard (1952‚Äì59), Annibale (1952‚Äì59) and Antonio (1953‚Äì59) in The Gondoliers (a role that took advantage of his dancing skills),Young, Robin. \\"John Reed: Comic lead of the D'Oyly Carte\\".

Gramophone, 22 February 2010 During these two decades, his parts were as follows: Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance (a role that he gave up in 1969), Bunthorne in Patience, the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe, King Gama in Princess Ida, Ko-Ko in The Mikado, Robin Oakapple/Sir Ruthven in Ruddigore, Jack Point in The Yeomen of the Guard, the Duke of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers,Rollins and Witts, pp. 183‚Äì86 and John Wellington Wells in The Sorcerer (beginning with the 1971 revival).Wilson and Lloyd, p. 182 He dropped from his repertory the role of the Judge in Trial by Jury, in 1959, briefly resuming it for the D'Oyly Carte's centenary celebrations at the Savoy Theatre in 1975.The Savoyard, September 1974, p. 3; and January 1975, p. 5 For that season, he also played Scaphio in Utopia, Limited and Grand Duke Rudolph in the company's concert of The Grand Duke.The Savoyard, January 1975, p. 5 The company had not performed these two works since the original productions in the 1890s. Reed also participated in eleven of the company's overseas tours to North America (eight times), Denmark (1970), Rome (1974) and Australasia (1979).Prestige, Colin. \\"John Reed ‚Äì Savoyard\\". Memories of the D'Oyly Carte, accessed 15 February 2010 Reed performed at a Jubilee Year Royal Command Performance at Windsor Castle in 1977 In 1977, Reed was honoured as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). He played before Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the Royal Family at least eight times, including in 1977 for the queen's Silver Jubilee Command Performance, at Windsor Castle, of H.M.S. Pinafore.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 178 Reed told interviewer Colin Prestige that \\"When the Prince of Wales, aged eleven, saw The Mikado, Ko-Ko afterwards entertained him in the dressing-room.\\" Although Reed loved the family atmosphere of the company during his nearly thirty years there, he later felt that the company's dynamic was changing. He decided to leave the company during the 1979 Australasian tour, and author Ian Bradley relates one of the incidents that served as a tipping point: \\"At the end of their first rehearsal [in Australia], conductor Fraser Goulding asked the chorus to stay on for a few minutes just to polish the act 2 finale. The Equity representative promptly stood up and said, 'You know that means we'll be going into overtime'. Reed says: ... we used to go on far into the evening working on things to get them right and never thought of overtime. I realized that was the time to go'.\\"Bradley, p. 42 =Assessment= Reed said that, of his roles, he probably loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, \\"[I]t's such fun to do ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people.\\"John Reed obituary. The Telegraph, 22 February 2010 He also commented, \\"Ko-Ko is almost me.

Memories of the D'Oyly Carte, accessed 15 February 2010 On the other hand, he said, \\"Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, and I go and hide behind my characters.\\" Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. \\"Jack Point is me in another age ‚Äì just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart\\". Reed said that every comedian savours the chance to play a role like Point in which \\"you like to see if you can make 'em cry a little\\".\\"Stage Actor Reed Enjoys Comedic Roles\\", Ocala Star-Banner, 1 February 1988, p. 7C He also noted that, generally, \\"I like anything where the dancing comes in\\". His least favourite role was Major- General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: \\"the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on\\". Of the \\"younger\\" roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, \\"I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young.\\" He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala \\"last nights\\" of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of \\"Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty.\\" In its obituary, The Guardian asserted: Reed's \\"comic timing, nimble footwork and clarity of diction made him the acknowledged master of the \\"patter\\" roles, at once the most challenging and defining of all Gilbert and Sullivan's creations. His biographer, Cynthia Morey, praised his \\"feet that hardly seemed to touch the floor as he danced across the stage; the sly glance and raised eyebrow that could bring the house down.\\"Morey, Cynthia. \\"Obituaries: John Lamb Reed OBE\\", Gilbert and Sullivan News, Spring 2010, p. 7 The Times called his stage personality \\"impish\\", writing: \\"He was, quite simply, a phenomenon. For 48 gruelling weeks of each of those 20 years he effortlessly negotiated the tongue-twisting patter songs.\\" The latter paper judged Reed a success in his desire to play pathos: \\"His Jack Point, the lovelorn jester in The Yeomen of the Guard, and the role which he dubbed 'the one apart, the Hamlet of Gilbert and Sullivan', could easily bring a tear to the eye, as did his spoken rendition of 'Iolanthe, thou livest?'\\" Of his Ko-Ko, The Times stated, \\"The brightest performance of the evening comes from Mr. John Reed, a spirited Ko- Ko with exactly the right stature and crystal clear diction\\".\\"Gilbert Taken at Funereal Pace\\", The Times, 20 December 1960 The same paper commented, regarding his Sir Joseph Porter, \\"Mr. Reed's impersonation, prim, dry, roundly articulated (and sung in tune, as some of his illustrious predecessors never attempted to do), was eminently likeable.\\"\\"Novelty and Tradition\\", The Times, 12 December 1961 Of his Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd, it said, \\"Reed, in particular, chose understatement as his main weapon, and in his dryness, at once naive and sophisticated, produced a Murgatroyd very much in the authentic D'Oyly Carte tradition.\\"Ruddigore of High Tonal Quality\\", The Times, 7 December 1965 Critic Alan Blyth commented that in his Bunthorne, \\"Reed ... remains a past master of keeping the text fresh and articulated\\".Blyth, Alan. \\"Patience: Sadler's Wells\\", The Times, 18 December 1973 Blyth also wrote that \\"The Lord Chancellor is one of John Reed's most appropriate roles, with plenty of scope for his fleet-footed clowning, and in the Nightmare-Song he gives an object-lesson in projecting one of Gilbert's most complex texts.\\"Blyth, Alan. \\"Iolanthe: Sadler's Wells Theatre\\", The Times, 23 December 1975 In The New York Times, Milton Esterow praised Reed's Lord Chancellor: \\"Not only is he light, but he virtually floats. The man is irresistibly comic. Of course in his dignified official robes he is also austere, which is what a good Lord Chancellor should be.\\"\\"D'Oyly Carte Company Presents Iolanthe\\", The New York Times, 28 November 1962, p. 42 Reed's fans eagerly anticipated his \\"business\\" in the many encores that followed some of his songs, in which \\"his antics would become ever more outrageous. ... Reed's Sir Joseph Porter would jump overboard only to re-enter clutching a rubber life-ring, while ... his Ko-Ko would be found furiously ‚Äì and anachronistically ‚Äì pedalling across the stage in a toy car.\\" On the other hand, he was sometimes criticised for these instances of dropping character and adding anachronisms. He explained, \\"An encore is a different thing - a bit of fun between me and the audience - then I come right back into character again.\\" =After the D'Oyly Carte= After he left the D'Oyly Carte organisation in 1979, Reed continued to perform in, and direct, Gilbert and Sullivan productions for the rest of his career, also occasionally appearing in other theatre. He appeared as a guest artist numerous times with D'Oyly Carte after his retirement, including their \\"last night\\" concert in 1982. The solo show A Song to Sing, O was created for and premiered by him at the Savoy Theatre in 1981. The reviewer for The Times disliked the piece, commenting, \\"The attraction is almost entirely the talented twisting of Mr. Reed's tongue around familiar patter.\\"Chaillet, Ned. \\"A Song to Sing, O: Savoy\\", The Times, 15 April 1981 Reed performed and directed, through the 1980s, with many Gilbert and Sullivan companies, both professional and amateur, flying back and forth from Europe to North America.

It was based on the GM X platform along with the Oldsmobile Omega, Chevrolet Nova, and the Pontiac Ventura. The car was named for the Greek god Apollo. It was available as a coupe, two-door hatchback, or four-door sedan. The two-door models were renamed Skylark for 1975; only the sedan carried the Apollo nameplate for that year. A total of 112,901 Apollos were built.The total does not include Buick Skylarks for 1975. The Apollo was powered by a standard Chevrolet inline six or an optional Buick V8, available with either a two- or four-barrel carburetor. A three-speed manual transmission was standard, with a three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic optional. The Oldsmobile 260 was added as the base V8 option for 1975. Standard equipment on the Apollo included a semi-closed cooling system, manual brakes with finned front drums, coil spring front suspension with stabilizer bar, extensive use of insulation and sound deadening materials, flow-through ventilation system, full-foam seats, front and rear ashtrays, reinforced front bumpers, carpeting, roof drip moldings, and front and rear wheel opening moldings. Options included variable-ratio power steering, power drum or power front disc brakes, E78x14 bias-belted tires, custom cloth interior trim, convenience center storage compartment, tilt steering wheel, climate control air conditioning with low Freon detector switch, rear window defogger (blower), tinted glass, sport mirrors with drivers remote control, bumper protective strips with white accent stripe- front and rear, bumper guards front and rear, color-coordinated body protective side moldings, deluxe wheel covers, deluxe wire wheel covers, chrome-plated styled wheels (Buick rally wheels) and a custom vinyl top. Steel-belted tires were introduced in 1975. There was no conventional antenna mounted on the body of the car. Instead, two wires were embedded in the layers of glass in the windshield. The 1974 Apollo debuted with only subtle differences. A chrome strip above the grille and roof-mounted safety restraints were added. A GSX package became available on the coupe for 1974, however, it was purely cosmetic changes, lacking the performance upgrades that distinguished it in previous years. It was available in red or white and featured a blacked-out grille, unique striping, white vinyl bucket seats with red interior accents, and wire wheel covers. The GSX was available with the straight six or either 350 V8, and could be ordered with any of the optional equipment available to other Apollo models. The 1975 Apollo was only available as a four-door sedan and adopted the redesigned X-body shell with a boxier European look which replaced the former Coke-bottle shape.

First published in 1919 for voice and piano, in 1920 a different publisher reissued the piece \\"revised and corrected\\".Wolfgang Rathert and Andreas Traub, \\"Zu einer bislang unbekannten Ausgabe des 'Socrate' von Erik Satie\\", in Die Musikforschung, Jg. 38 (1985), booklet 2, . A third version of the work exists, for small orchestra and voice, for which the manuscript has disappeared and which is available now only in print. The text is composed of excerpts of Victor Cousin's translation of Plato's dialogues, all of the chosen texts referring to Socrates. Commission ‚Äì composition Self portrait by Winnaretta Singer, Princess Edmond de Polignac (Fondation Singer-Polignac, Paris) The work was commissioned by Princess Edmond de Polignac in October 1916. The Princess had specified that female voices should be used: originally the idea had been that Satie would write incidental music to a performance where the Princess and/or some of her (female) friends would read aloud texts of the ancient Greek philosophers. As Satie, after all, was not so much in favour of melodrama-like settings, that idea was abandoned, and the text would be sung ‚Äî be it in a more or less reciting way. However, the specification remained that only female voices could be used (for texts of dialogues that were supposed to have taken place between men). Satie composed Socrate between January 1917 and the spring of 1918, with a revision of the orchestral score in October of that same year. During the first months he was working on the composition, he called it Vie de Socrate. In 1917 Satie was hampered by a lawsuit over an insulting postcard he had sent, which nearly resulted in prison time. The Princess diverted this danger by her financial intercession in the first months of 1918, after which Satie could work free of fear. The musical form First page of Satie's manuscript for Socrate Satie presents Socrate as a \\"symphonic drama in three parts\\". \\"Symphonic drama\\" appears to allude to Romeo et Juliette, a \\"dramatic symphony\\" that Hector Berlioz had written nearly eighty years earlier: and as usual, when Satie makes such allusions, the result is about the complete reversal of the former example. Where Berlioz's symphony is more than an hour and a half of expressionistic, heavily orchestrated drama, an opera forced into the form of a symphony, Satie's thirty-minute composition reveals little drama in the music: the drama is entirely concentrated in the text, which is presented in the form of recitativo-style singing to a background of sparsely orchestrated, nearly repetitive music, picturing some aspects of Socrates' life, including his final moments. As Satie apparently did not foresee an enacted or scenic representation, and also while he disconnected the male roles (according to the text) from the female voice(s) delivering these texts, keeping in mind a good understandability of the story exclusively by the words of the text, the form of the composition could rather be considered as (secular) oratorio, than opera, or (melo)drama (or symphony). It is possible to think that Satie took formally similar secular cantatas for one or two voices and a moderate accompaniment as his examples for the musical form of Socrate: nearly all Italian and German Baroque composers had written such small-scale cantatas, generally on an Italian text: Vivaldi (RV 649‚Äì686), Handel (HWV 77‚Äì177), Bach (BWV 203, 209), etc. This link is however unlikely: these older compositions all alternated recitatives with arias, further there is very little evidence Satie ever based his work directly on the examples of foreign baroque composers, and most of all, as far as the baroque composers were known in early 20th century Paris, these small secular Italian cantatas would be the least remembered works of any of these composers. The three parts of the composition are: # Portrait de Socrate (\\"Portrait of Socrates\\"), text taken from Plato's Symposium # Les bords de l'Ilissus (\\"The banks of the Ilissus\\"), text taken from Plato's Phaedrus # Mort de Socrate (\\"Death of Socrates\\"), text taken from Plato's Phaedo The music The piece is written for voice and orchestra, but also exists in a version for voice and piano. This reduction had been produced by Satie, concurrently with the orchestral version. Each speaker in the various sections is meant to be represented by a different singer (Alcibiades, Socrates, Phaedrus, Phaedo), according to Satie's indication two of these voices soprano, the two other mezzo-sopranos. Nonetheless all parts are more or less in the same range, and the work can easily be sung by a single voice, and has often been performed and recorded by a single vocalist, female as well as male. Such single vocalist performances diminish however the effect of dialogue (at least in the two first parts of the symphonic drama ‚Äì in the third part there is only Phaedo telling the story of Socrates' death). The music is characterised by simple repetitive rhythms, parallel cadences, and long ostinati. The text Although more recent translations were available, Satie preferred Victor Cousin's then antiquated French translation of Plato's texts: he found in them more clarity, simplicity and beauty. The translation of the libretto of Socrate that follows is taken from Benjamin Jowett's translations of Plato's dialogues that can be found on the Gutenberg Project website. The original French text can be found here. =Part I ‚Äì Portrait of Socrates= Marcello Bacciarelli, Alcibiades and Socrates [From Symposium, 32‚Äì33‚Äì35] ;Alcibiades:And now, my boys, I shall praise Socrates in a figure which will appear to him to be a caricature, and yet I speak, not to make fun of him, but only for the truth's sake. I say, that he is exactly like the busts of Silenus, which are set up in the statuaries' shops, holding pipes and flutes in their mouths; and they are made to open in the middle, and have images of gods inside them. I say also that he is like Marsyas the satyr. [...] And are you not a flute-player? That you are, and a performer far more wonderful than Marsyas. He indeed with instruments used to charm the souls of men by the power of his breath, and the players of his music do so still: for the melodies of Olympus are derived from Marsyas who taught them [...] But you produce the same effect with your words only, and do not require the flute: that is the difference between you and him. [...] And if I were not afraid that you would think me hopelessly drunk, I would have sworn as well as spoken to the influence which they have always had and still have over me. For my heart leaps within me more than that of any Corybantian reveller, and my eyes rain tears when I hear them. And I observe that many others are affected in the same manner. [...] And this is what I and many others have suffered from the flute-playing of this satyr. ;Socrates:[...] you praised me, and I in turn ought to praise my neighbour on the right [...] =Part II ‚Äì On the banks of the Ilissus= The ruins of ancient Athens as seen from the river Ilisos (Ilissus) in 1833. Today this river runs mostly underground. [From Phaedrus, 4‚Äì5] ;Socrates:Let us turn aside and go by the Ilissus; we will sit down at some quiet spot. ;Phaedrus:I am fortunate in not having my sandals, and as you never have any, I think that we may go along the brook and cool our feet in the water; this will be the easiest way, and at midday and in the summer is far from being unpleasant. ;Socrates:Lead on, and look out for a place in which we can sit down. ;Phaedrus:Do you see the tallest plane-tree in the distance? ;Socrates:Yes. ;Phaedrus:There are shade and gentle breezes, and grass on which we may either sit or lie down. ;Socrates:Move forward. ;Phaedrus:I should like to know, Socrates, whether the place is not somewhere here at which Boreas is said to have carried off Orithyia from the banks of the Ilissus? ;Socrates:Such is the tradition. ;Phaedrus:And is this the exact spot? The little stream is delightfully clear and bright; I can fancy that there might be maidens playing near. ;Socrates:I believe that the spot is not exactly here, but about a quarter of a mile lower down, where you cross to the temple of Artemis, and there is, I think, some sort of an altar of Boreas at the place. ;Phaedrus:I have never noticed it; but I beseech you to tell me, Socrates, do you believe this tale? ;Socrates:The wise are doubtful, and I should not be singular if, like them, I too doubted. I might have a rational explanation that Orithyia was playing with Pharmacia, when a northern gust carried her over the neighbouring rocks; and this being the manner of her death, she was said to have been carried away by Boreas. [...] according to another version of the story she was taken from Areopagus, and not from this place. [...] But let me ask you, friend: have we not reached the plane-tree to which you were conducting us? ;Phaedrus:Yes, this is the tree. ;Socrates:By Here, a fair resting-place, full of summer sounds and scents. Here is this lofty and spreading plane-tree, and the agnus castus high and clustering, in the fullest blossom and the greatest fragrance; and the stream which flows beneath the plane-tree is deliciously cold to the feet. Judging from the ornaments and images, this must be a spot sacred to Achelous and the Nymphs. How delightful is the breeze:--so very sweet; and there is a sound in the air shrill and summerlike which makes answer to the chorus of the cicadae. But the greatest charm of all is the grass, like a pillow gently sloping to the head. My dear Phaedrus, you have been an admirable guide. =Part III ‚Äì Death of Socrates= Jacques-Louis David - The Death of Socrates [From Phaedo, 3‚Äì23‚Äì25‚Äì28‚Äì65‚Äì67] ;Phaedo: As [...] Socrates lay in prison [...] we had been in the habit of assembling early in the morning at the court in which the trial took place, and which is not far from the prison. There we used to wait talking with one another until the opening of the doors (for they were not opened very early); then we went in and generally passed the day with Socrates. [...] On our arrival the jailer who answered the door, instead of admitting us, came out and told us to stay until he called us. [...] He soon returned and said that we might come in. On entering we found Socrates just released from chains, and Xanthippe, whom you know, sitting by him, and holding his child in her arms. [...] Socrates, sitting up on the couch, bent and rubbed his leg, saying, as he was rubbing: \\"How singular is the thing called pleasure, and how curiously related to pain, which might be thought to be the opposite of it; [...] Why, because each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the soul to the body [...] I am not very likely to persuade other men that I do not regard my present situation as a misfortune, if I cannot even persuade you that I am no worse off now than at any other time in my life. Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans? For they, when they perceive that they must die, having sung all their life long, do then sing more lustily than ever, rejoicing in the thought that they are about to go away to the god whose ministers they are.\\" [...] :Often, [...] I have wondered at Socrates, but never more than on that occasion. [...] I was close to him on his right hand, seated on a sort of stool, and he on a couch which was a good deal higher. He stroked my head, and pressed the hair upon my neck‚Äîhe had a way of playing with my hair; and then he said: \\"To-morrow, Phaedo, I suppose that these fair locks of yours will be severed.\\" [...] When he had spoken these words, he arose and went into a chamber to bathe; Crito followed him and told us to wait. [...] When he came out, he sat down with us again after his bath, but not much was said. Soon the jailer, who was the servant of the Eleven, entered and stood by him, saying: \\"To you, Socrates, whom I know to be the noblest and gentlest and best of all who ever came to this place, I will not impute the angry feelings of other men, who rage and swear at me, when, in obedience to the authorities, I bid them drink the poison‚Äîindeed, I am sure that you will not be angry with me; for others, as you are aware, and not I, are to blame. And so fare you well, and try to bear lightly what must needs be‚Äîyou know my errand.\\" Then bursting into tears he turned away and went out. Socrates looked at him and said: \\"I return your good wishes, and will do as you bid.\\" Then turning to us, he said: \\"How charming the man is: since I have been in prison he has always been coming to see me, and at times he would talk to me, and was as good to me as could be, and now see how generously he sorrows on my account. We must do as he says, Crito; and therefore let the cup be brought, if the poison is prepared: if not, let the attendant prepare some.\\" [...] :Crito made a sign to the servant, who was standing by; and he went out, and having been absent for some time, returned with the jailer carrying the cup of poison. Socrates said: \\"You, my good friend, who are experienced in these matters, shall give me directions how I am to proceed.\\" The man answered: \\"You have only to walk about until your legs are heavy, and then to lie down, and the poison will act.\\" At the same time he handed the cup to Socrates [...] Then raising the cup to his lips, quite readily and cheerfully he drank off the poison. And hitherto most of us had been able to control our sorrow; but now when we saw him drinking, and saw too that he had finished the draught, we could no longer forbear, and in spite of myself my own tears were flowing fast; so that I covered my face and wept, not for him, but at the thought of my own calamity in having to part from such a friend. [...] and he walked about until, as he said, his legs began to fail, and then he lay on his back, according to the directions, and the man who gave him the poison now and then looked at his feet and legs; and after a while he pressed his foot hard, and asked him if he could feel; and he said: \\"No\\"; and then his leg, and so upwards and upwards, and showed us that he was cold and stiff. And he felt them himself, and said: \\"When the poison reaches the heart, that will be the end.\\" He was beginning to grow cold about the groin, when he uncovered his face, for he had covered himself up, and said‚Äîthey were his last words‚Äîhe said: \\"Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt?\\" [...] in a minute or two a movement was heard, and the attendants uncovered him; his eyes were set, and Crito closed his eyes and mouth. Such was the end, Echecrates, of our friend; concerning whom I may truly say, that of all the men of his time whom I have known, he was the wisest and justest and best. Whiteness Satie described he meant Socrate to be white, and mentions to his friends that for achieving that whiteness, he gets himself into the right mood by eating nothing other than \\"white\\" foods. He wants Socrate to be transparent, lucid, and unimpassioned ‚Äì not so surprising as counter-reaction to the turmoil that came over him for writing an offensive postcard. He also appreciated the fragile humanity of the ancient Greek philosophers to which he was devoting his music. Reception history Some critics characterized the work as dull or featureless ‚Äì others find in it an almost superhuman tranquility and delicate beauty. =First performances= The first (private) performance of parts of the work had taken place in April 1918 with the composer at the piano and Jane Bathori singing (all the parts), in the salons of the Princess de Polignac. Several more performances of the piano version were held, public as well as private, amongst others Andr√© Gide, James Joyce and Paul Val√©ry attending. The vocal score (this is the piano version) was available in print from the end of 1919 on. It is said Gertrude Stein became an admirer of Satie hearing Virgil Thomson perform the Socrate music on his piano. In June 1920 the first public performance of the orchestral version was presented. The public thought it was hearing a new musical joke by Satie, and laughed ‚Äì Satie felt misunderstood by that behavior. The orchestral version was not printed until several decades after Satie's death. =Reception in music, theatre and art history= In 1936 Virgil Thomson asked Alexander Calder to create a stage set for Socrate. New York Times critic Robert Shattuck described the 1977 National Tribute to Alexander Calder performance, ‚ÄúI have always gone away with the feeling that Socrate creates a large space that it does not itself completely fill‚Ä¶ Here, of course, is where Calder comes in: He was commissioned to do sets for Socrate in 1936.‚Äùhttps://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07E5D61F31E135A25755C0A9679D946690D6CF In 1936 the American premiere of Socrate, with a mobile set by Alexander Calder was held at the Wadsworth Atheneum.http://thewadsworth.org/wp- content/uploads/2011/03/wama_firsts_november2014.pdf The work then traveled to the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center for the opening week of the FAC.http://www.csfineartscenter.org/about/history/birth-of-the-colorado- springs-fine-arts-center/ John Cage transcribed the music of Socrate for two pianos in 1944 for Merce Cunningham's dance, titled Idyllic Song. A later dance, Second Hand, was also based on Satie's Socrate. When in 1969 √âditions Max Eschig refused performing rights, Cage made Cheap Imitation, based on an identical rhythmic structure. In 2015, ninety years after Satie's death, Cage's 1944 setting was performed by Alexander Lubimov and Slava PopruginSlava Poprugin on Royal Conservatoire The Hague for the CD Paris joyeux & triste. The Belgian painter Jan Cox (1919‚Äì1980) made two paintings on the theme of the death of Socrates (1952 and 1979, a year before his suicide), both paintings referring to Satie's Socrate: pieces of the printed score of Satie's Socrate were glued on one of these paintings; the other has quotes of Cousin's translation of Plato on the frame. Mark Morris created a dance in 1983 to the third section of Socrate, The Death of Socrates with a set design by Robert Bordo. Morris later choreographed the entire work, which premiered in 2010 (costume design by Martin Pakledinaz, lighting design and decor by Michael Chybowski).

The name is most likely derived from Ventura, California.  1960‚Äì1970 full-sized  The Ventura was first introduced for 1960 as a new higher priced model on Pontiac's standard full-size 122-inch B-body wheelbase, shared with the Pontiac Catalina. It was available as the Vista (a four-door hardtop) and the Sports Coupe (a two-door hardtop).1960 Pontiac brochure, storm.oldcarmanualproject.com Retrieved 19 February 2018 It had unique exterior identification, deluxe wheel covers, a sport steering wheel, and distinctive tri-tone seats done in \\"Morrokide\\" (Pontiac's leather-like vinyl upholstery). The Ventura continued for 1961 as a series. Reduced to trim option With the rollout of the Pontiac Grand Prix, the rationale for the existence of the Ventura as a standalone model was eliminated. The Ventura was demoted to a trim option for 1962 through 1965 on for Catalina models. It returned for 1970, it was a custom trim option on the Catalina. The name was retired at the end of the 1970 model year, as deemed for full-size cars, being transferred to a compact based on the Chevrolet Nova that was sold by Pontiac dealers through most of the mid-70s. 1970 Pontiac Catalina Hardtop Coupe with Ventura option  1971‚Äì1977 X-body compact  In 1971, Pontiac moved the name to their new X-body entry, the Ventura II. 1971 Pontiac Ventura II Coupe Ventura II production ran from 1971 to 1977. The \\"II\\" suffix was dropped after 1972, and the Phoenix name replaced Ventura in 1978. Engine offerings for the abbreviated 1971 model year included a 250 cu in. six cylinder or 307 cu in., only the 307 was available for the Sprint option in '71. For 1972, a Pontiac- built 350 cu in. V8 with two-barrel carburetor was added to the option list and became the base V8 for 1973 and 1974. Transmission offerings consisted of a standard column-shift three-speed manual with options including a four-speed manual, two-speed automatic (with six-cylinder) or three-speed Turbo Hydra- Matic automatic (with V8s). The 1973 six-cylinder Ventura was the last Pontiac model to offer the two-speed automatic, a badge-engineered Chevrolet Powerglide, which was dropped completely from all GM cars and trucks after this model year in favor of the Turbo Hydra-Matic. 1973 Pontiac Ventura Sprint coupe A Ventura Sprint option package was offered on two-door models 1971 to 1975, including three-speed transmission with floor shift and optional 350 cu in. V8 equipped four-speed, body color mirrors, custom carpeting, all-vinyl upholstery with either the standard bench or optional Strato bucket seats, Custom Sport steering wheel, blackout-grille trim, special striping, blackout grille, and 14x6\\" (36 cm diameter, 15 cm wide) wheels. In mid-1972, Pontiac introduced the limited production Ventura SD for the Southern California market as sort of a sporty-luxury compact to counter imported luxury sedans then taking the U.S. market by storm. The SD option added the high-back Strato bucket seats from the Firebird along with a Custom Sport steering wheel, Rally II wheels, uprated suspension and other items. Some 250 Ventura SD's were built for 1972, all at the GM Nova/Ventura assembly plant in Van Nuys, California plant. In 1973, higher spec cars received a new split grille in the Firebird/GTO style. Lower grade cars retained the split level grille used in 1971 and 1972. The Ventura Custom became a separate series (2Z, versus 2Y for the regular Ventura), carrying a \\"Custom\\" script on the rear roof pillar. In addition to the two-door coupe and four-door sedan, a three-door hatchback coupe was added to the lineup. In 1974, the Pontiac GTO name moved to the Ventura from the intermediate LeMans line. The GTO package gave the basic Ventura a 350 cu in. (5.7L) engine with a four-barrel carburetor of about 200 hp (149 kW). The package also came with a functional \\"shaker\\" hood scoop, tri- color GTO decals, Rally II wheels, and special grill-mounted driving lights. The GTO package could be ordered on the hatchback Ventura as well as the base and Custom coupes. 1975 Pontiac Ventura The GTO was dropped in 1975, along with the Pontiac 350. The Ventura could be optioned with the Buick 350 V8 instead. The Ventura SJ was a new offering for 1975, when the Ventura and other GM compacts were restyled with new rooflines along with improved suspensions shared with the second generation F platform (Camaro/Firebird), plus standard front disc brakes. The Ventura SJ was marketed as an American rendition of a Euro-style luxury sport sedan that Pontiac created with the larger mid-sized Grand Am in 1973, as well as a competitor to the new-for-1975 Ford Granada and Mercury Monarch, both marketed as luxury compacts designed to compete with the more expensive imports such as Audi and Mercedes. As such the Ventura SJ included an upgraded interior with reclining bucket seats in either cloth or vinyl along with a center console, rally instrumentation and other items. 1976 Pontiac Ventura Coupe Only minor appearance changes were made to the Ventura for 1976 and 1977 including new grilles and revised taillights. 1976 saw the inclusion of the Oldsmobile 260 cubic inch V8. For 1977, the Chevy 250 six was replaced by Buick's 231 cu in V6 as the base powerplant and the Chevrolet 305 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option; the 2.5 liter \\"Iron Duke\\" 4-cylinder was also (and unusually) optional along with the 301 cu in V8. One unique feature for 1976 was the availability of a 5-speed manual transmission (Borg Warner T-50) with the 260 cubic inch V8; it was the standard transmission with the Iron Duke. Under 700 units total with this combination were built in 1976. At the beginning of the 1977 model year, the Ventura SJ was the top-line model but at mid-year was replaced by the Phoenix, which featured a distinctive center grille and rectangular headlights and the most luxurious interior available in a Pontiac X-body car. Otherwise, the Phoenix was basically a plushed up Ventura much like the Chevrolet Concours was related to the more mundane Nova. For 1978, the Ventura nameplate was retired and all X-body cars were sold under the Phoenix nameplate through that year and into 1979 with a top-line Phoenix SJ designated as the top-line series.

They form a subset of third culture kids (TCKs). The term is more specifically applied when these children return to their \\"home\\" or passport country (the country of their citizenship), and often experience various difficulties identifying with fellow citizens and integrating \\"back\\" into their \\"home\\" culture. The resulting feeling is described as \\"reverse culture shock\\". There is some confusion between the terms MK and TCK. According to the definition developed by Ruth Hill Useem, TCKs are people who have spent a significant part of their developmental years outside their parents' culture.Third Culture Kids, pp. 21‚Äì23 TCK is a broad term that encompasses all children who have grown up abroad (i.e. military kids, diplomats' kids, immigrants). Missionary kids are just one of the many categories of kids who qualify as TCKs. Therefore, while all MKs are TCKs, not all TCKs are MKs. In the past MKs usually were thought of only as American or European, but there is a growing number of MKs from other countries, especially Protestant Christian MKs from South Korea Increase of non-Western missionaries ‚Äî by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA. (accessed 2007-04-04). and from Latin America. Generally, this term applies to Protestant Christians;; however, it can be applied to any denomination of a religion. Definition =Life overseas= While MKs often identify more with the culture or country where they were raised (and this could be multiple cities, countries, or continents) than with where their parents were raised, they are not fully at home in any one culture. David C. Pollock and Van Reken attribute this feeling of displacement, or rootlessness, to a lack of emotional connection to their home culture (where they \\"should\\" feel connected).Third Culture Kids, pp. 123 Many MKs find it difficult to answer questions about where they are from or where home is as they may feel more of an emotional connection to their host culture than to their \\"home\\" culture. However, at the same time many MKs are completely aware that they can never fully fit into their host culture. This is especially obvious to MKs growing up in countries where they look different from the local population. Pollock and Van Reken developed the PolVan Cultural Identity Model to explain cultural identity in relationship to the surrounding culture. The Model names four categories into which a person can fall based on how they look and think compared to the culture around them:Third Culture Kids pp. 54‚Äì56 ;Foreigner : look different, think different ;Adopted : look different, think alike ;Hidden Immigrant : look alike, think different ;Mirror : look alike, think alike When MKs first transition to their new or \\"host\\" culture, they are in the foreigner category. As they continue the transition and begin to acclimate and feel at home in their host culture, MKs move into the adopted category, often to the point where MKs feel more at home in the host culture than in their passport culture. At this point, the host culture becomes the MK's home culture. Upon returning to their passport culture, MKs often find themselves in the hidden immigrant category. Because they look like their peers, their extended family remembers how they were prior to their international move and expect them to hold similar views and to act as a typical citizen of that passport country would act. However, as hidden immigrants, MKs look like their family and friends, but more often than not hold many differing views and opinions. Additionally, MKs may not be aware of many of the pop culture influences within their passport country, yet are aware of world and regional issues, which most citizens of their passport country are unaware of. This cultural disconnect can cause awkwardness when they return to their passport country.*Klemens & Bikos, p. 721 Children in the MKs' passport countries often find it difficult to relate to missionary children, and vice versa. While MKs may find the lives of their peers in their passport countries to be boring, sometimes creating challenging social situations, passport country kids may be intimidated by MKs' experience abroad. Cultural miscommunications are common and interesting. While MKs often find it difficult to relate to people from their home culture or target culture, they get along with other MKs very well, even those who are missionaries to (or from) a completely different country. It is the commonality of differences that draws MKs together. MKs tend to be open-minded and tolerant of many diverse cultures. They often feel more at home in culturally rich environments and can be \\"homesick\\" for their foreign home. Their knowledge of a country and its culture typically exceeds language fluency. Upon returning to their passport country, MKs possess unique skills that can be helpful to academics and governments. Because of their international experience, they often have a much broader worldview than their peers. This broader worldview can also lead to mixed emotions about their passport country and its foreign policies. =Return to passport country= Children who immigrate to the United States have similar experience to MKs when it comes to learning a new culture and making cross-cultural transitions. But according to Pollack and Van Reken, what truly distinguishes MKs from children who immigrate to the United States or other countries is \\"the full expectation that after living for a significant period of their developmental years outside their passport culture, there will come the day when TCKs make a permanent return to that country and culture.\\"Third Culture Kids p 225 MKs return to their passport country for many reasons, including the beginning of their college education, a shift in their parents' career, and even evacuation in more extreme cases. Extended family and friends's excitement at MKs' return does not usually carry over to the MK. The events surrounding an MK's return may be traumatic (such as in the event of an evacuation due to political unrest), but even under normal circumstances MKs' return to their country of citizenship is a cause of stress and grief. Anxiety and depressions are the two emotions most commonly associated with cross-cultural transitions, caused by a sense of vulnerability and loss of control.Davis, Headley, et al. p 187 To help MKs cope with the transition back to the United States, many colleges, particularly Christian colleges, have chapters of a student organization called \\"Mu Kappa International\\".Mu Kappa International website Mu Kappa aims to help MKs and other TCKs with the transition to American culture and college life. Mu Kappa was founded in 1985 at Taylor University, and has since spread to more than forty other American colleges and universities. Another frequently used method of helping MKs cope with transitioning from their foreign home to their passport culture is through transition seminars. These seminars typically take place during the summer before an MK's freshman year of college and teach MKs the basics of everyday life in America, including putting gas in a car, opening a bank account, grocery shopping, and many other every day tasks.Davis, Headley, et al. p. 188 Additionally, these seminar can help MKs understand how to deal with the grief of permanently transitioning back to their passport country in a healthy way, and how to manage the stress of a new environment and reverse culture shock.

Historically, it is defined in the zone file, an operating system text file that starts with the special DNS record type Start of Authority (SOA) and contains all records for the resources described within the zone. This format was originally used by the Berkeley Internet Name Domain Server (BIND) software package, and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035. Domains and zones Most top-level domain name registry operators offer their name spaces to the public or to entities with mandated geographic or otherwise scoped purpose for registration of second- level domains. Similarly an organization in charge of a lower level domain may operate its name space similarly and subdivide its space. Each registration or allocation of subdomain space obligates the registrant to maintain an administrative and technical infrastructure to manage the responsibility for its zone, including sub-delegation to lower-level domains. Each delegation confers essentially unrestricted technical autonomy over the allocated space. An area of one or more subdomains that has been delegated for management is called a DNS zone. A zone always starts at a domain boundary to include all leaf nodes (hosts) in the domain, or it ends at the boundary of another independently managed zone. As each domain is further divided into sub- domains, each becoming a DNS zone itself with its own set of administrators and DNS servers, the tree grows with the largest number of leaf nodes at the bottom. At this lowest level, in the end-nodes or leaves of the tree, the term DNS zone becomes essentially synonymous with the term \\"domain\\", both in terms of use and administration. The term domain is used in the business functions of the entity assigned to it and the term zone is usually used for configuration of DNS services. Forward DNS zones DNS zones contain the records for the mapping of domain names to IP addresses or other information. The resolution of a domain name to its assigned information is also referred to as forward resolution and the DNS zones associated with such processes are often referred to as forward zones.https://www.techopedia.com/definition/15671/forward-dns The term arose as the opposite of reverse zones, which are used for the reverse process: finding the DNS name associated with an IP address. Such reverse zones are maintained in the Internet Address and Routing Parameter Area (domain arpa). Another common use of the term forward zone refers to a specific configuration of DNS name servers, particularly caching name servers, in which resolution of a domain name is forwarded to another name server that is authoritative for the domain in question, rather than being answered from the established cache memory.http://www.mustbegeek.com/understanding-forward-and-reverse-lookup- zones-in-dns/#.XgjDbRdKiL4 Zones for Internet infrastructure The top-level domain arpa serves as a delegation zone for various technical infrastructure aspects of DNS and the Internet, and does not implement the registration and delegation system of the country and generic domains. The name arpa is a remnant of the ARPANET, one of the predecessor stages of the Internet. Intended as a transitional aid to the DNS system, deleting the domain arpa was later found to be impractical. Consequently, the name was officially redefined as an acronym for Address and Routing Parameter Area. It contains sub-zones used for reverse resolution of IP addresses to host names (IPv4: in-addr.arpa, IPv6: ip6.arpa), telephone number mapping (ENUM, e164.arpa), and uniform resource identifier resolution (uri.arpa, urn.arpa). Although the administrative structure of this domain and its sub-domains is different, the technical delegation into zones of responsibility is similar and the DNS tools and servers used are identical to any other zone. Sub-zones are delegated by components of the respective resources. For example, 8.8.2.5.5.2.2.0.0.8.1.e164.arpa., which might represent an E.164 telephone number in the ENUM system, might be sub-delegated at suitable boundaries of the name. An example of an IP addresses in the reverse DNS zone is 166.188.77.208.in-addr.arpa, which represents the address 208.77.188.166 and resolves to the domain name www.example.com. In the case of IP addresses, the reverse zones are delegated to the Internet service provider (ISP) to which the IP address block is assigned. When an ISP allocates a range to a customer, it usually also delegates the management of that space to the customer by insertion of name server resource records pointing to the customer's DNS facilities into their zone, or provides other management tools. Allocations of single IP addresses for networks connected through network address translation (NAT) typically do not provide such facilities. Example of zone authority in DNS queries As an example of the DNS resolving process, consider the role of a recursive DNS resolver attempting to look up the address \\"en.wikipedia.org.\\". It begins with a list of addresses for the most authoritative name servers it knows about ‚Äì the root zone name servers (indicated by the full stop or period), which contains name server information for all top-level domains (TLDs) of the Internet. When querying one of the root name servers, it is possible that the root zone will not directly contain a record for \\"en.wikipedia.org.\\", in which case it will provide a referral to the authoritative name servers for the \\"org.\\" top-level domain (TLD). The resolver is issued a referral to the authoritative name servers for the \\"org.\\" zone, which it will contact for more specific information. Again when querying one of the \\"org.\\" name servers, the resolver may be issued with another referral to the \\"wikipedia.org.\\" zone, whereupon it will again query for \\"en.wikipedia.org.\\". Since () \\"en.wikipedia.org.\\" is a CNAME to \\"text.wikimedia.org.\\" (which is in turn a CNAME to \\"text.esams.wikimedia.org.\\"), and the \\"wikipedia.org.\\" name servers also happen to contain authoritative data for the \\"wikimedia.org.\\" zone, the resolution of this particular query occurs entirely within the queried name server, and the resolver will receive the address record it requires with no further referrals. If the last name server queried did not contain authoritative data for the target of the CNAME, it would have issued the resolver with yet another referral, this time to the zone text.wikimedia.org.. However, since the resolver had previously determined the authoritative name servers for the zone org., it does not need to begin the resolution process from scratch but instead start at zone org., thus avoiding another query to the root name servers. There is no requirement that resolving should involve any referrals at all. Looking up en.wikipedia.org. on the root name servers always results in referrals, but if an alternative DNS root is used which is set up to contain a record for en.wikipedia.org., then the record is returned on the first query.

The chemical formula is . This yellow solid is the smallest peri-fused PAH (one where the rings are fused through more than one face). Pyrene forms during incomplete combustion of organic compounds. Occurrence and properties Pyrene was first isolated from coal tar, where it occurs up to 2% by weight. As a peri-fused PAH, pyrene is much more resonance-stabilized than its five-member-ring containing isomer fluoranthene. Therefore, it is produced in a wide range of combustion conditions. For example, automobiles produce about 1 Œºg/km.Senkan, Selim and Castaldi, Marco (2003) \\"Combustion\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. =Reactions= Oxidation with chromate affords perinaphthenone and then naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid. It undergoes a series of hydrogenation reactions, and it is susceptible to halogenation, Diels-Alder additions, and nitration, all with varying degrees of selectivity. Bromination occurs at one of the 3-positions. =Photophysics= Pyrene and its derivatives are used commercially to make dyes and dye precursors, for example pyranine and naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid. It has strong absorbance in UV-Vis in three sharp bands at 330 nm in DCM. The emission is close to the absorption, but moving at 375 nm. The morphology of the signals change with the solvent. Its derivatives are also valuable molecular probes via fluorescence spectroscopy, having a high quantum yield and lifetime (0.65 and 410 nanoseconds, respectively, in ethanol at 293 K). Pyrene was the first molecule for which excimer behavior was discovered. Such excimer appears around 450 nm. Theodor F√∂rster reported this in 1954. Applications Pyrene's fluorescence emission spectrum is very sensitive to solvent polarity, so pyrene has been used as a probe to determine solvent environments. This is due to its excited state having a different, non-planar structure than the ground state. Certain emission bands are unaffected, but others vary in intensity due to the strength of interaction with a solvent.Diagram showing the numbering and ring fusion locations of pyrene according to IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry. Although it is not as problematic as benzopyrene, animal studies have shown pyrene is toxic to the kidneys and liver. It is now known that pyrene affects several living functions in fish and algae. Experiments in pigs show that urinary 1-hydroxypyrene is a metabolite of pyrene, when given orally. Pyrenes are strong electron donor materials and can be combined with several materials in order to make electron donor-acceptor systems which can be used in energy conversion and light harvesting applications.

He is best known as lead guitarist of the 1960s Australian rock band The Easybeats who with fellow member George Young formed the 1970s and 1980s songwriting and record production duo Vanda & Young. Early life Vanda's family migratedhttps://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=1421902 to Australia from the Netherlands in 1963, and settled in Sydney. Vanda, who had been a guitarist with the Hague-based band The Starfighters, came to fame in 1964‚Äì65 as the lead guitarist of The Easybeats. In the same year he met rhythm guitarist George Young at the Villawood migrant hostel. In 2007, Australian Musician magazine selected this meeting as the most significant event in Australian pop and rock music history. Career In 1966, both Vanda and Young penned many of The Easybeats' later recordings, including their major international hit, \\"Friday On My Mind\\". After The Easybeats disbanded in 1970, Vanda & Young remained in the UK and continued their writing and performing partnership. In 1973, Vanda and Young returned to Australia and took over as the house producers for leading independent record production company, Albert Productions, and publisher J. Albert & Son. From 1974 onwards they enjoyed huge success in Australia and internationally, writing and producing hits for a number of popular Australian groups and solo singers, including John Paul Young, Cheetah, Stevie Wright, Ted Mulry, Rose Tattoo, The Angels, William Shakespeare, Mark Williams and, most notably, AC/DC. AC/DC included George Young's brothers, guitarists Angus and Malcolm Young. Vanda & Young produced landmark albums such as Let There Be Rock, Powerage, If You Want Blood You've Got It, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, High Voltage/TNT, amongst others. Vanda and Young also had major international success with their own studio-only project Flash and the Pan, achieving many hits round the world over a 15-year period, particularly in Europe where they had many chart topping records. Grace Jones had a hit with a cover of the Flash and the Pan song \\"Walking in the Rain\\". In 1988 Vanda was inducted, along with George Young, into the inaugural class of the ARIA Hall of Fame. By the late 1990s, Vanda and Young had left their longtime partnership with Albert Productions, and retired from the music industry. However, in 2005, Harry Vanda started Flashpoint Music in Surry Hills with his producer/engineer son, Daniel Vandenberg, setting up one of Australia's premier private studios. The studio has produced bands such as The Wrights and British India. Instruments  Vanda used a 1964 H√∂fner Verithin 1574 with Bigsby tremolo and 511 pickups, before switching in 1965 to a Gibson 345. In The Easybeats, Vanda also often played a cherry-red Maton 12-string electric guitar, which he donated to the collection of Powerhouse Museum in Sydney in 1999. In addition, Vanda owned the red Gretsch Jet Firebird double cutaway guitar that was given to George Young's younger brother Malcolm. This guitar, nicknamed \\"The Beast\\", saw numerous modifications and was Malcolm Young's primary guitar throughout his career with AC/DC.

It is situated at Northwood Headquarters in Northwood, London. The Permanent Joint Headquarters is commanded by the Chief of Joint Operations (CJO) and the current CJO is Vice Admiral Ben Key.  History  Major General Christopher Wallace led the team that began establishing the headquarters from 1994. \\"Senior officers in the Army and RAF did not welcome this initiative and Wallace had to deploy his considerable skills of advocacy to win that battle\\" (to establish the new joint headquarters). The Permanent Joint Headquarters was established on 1 April 1996 to enhance the operational effectiveness and efficiency of UK-led joint, potentially joint and multi-national operations, and to exercise operational command of UK forces assigned to multinational operations led by others. Wallace was appointed as CJO in the rank of lieutenant general. The PJHQ started to assume responsibility for military operations worldwide (fully operational) on 1 August 1996. The 35-hectare Northwood Headquarters site has belonged to the RAF since 1938. By mid-1998, a short-notice deployable headquarters commanded by a Brigadier-equivalent officer, the Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ) was being established within PJHQ. The JFHQ was an outgrowth of the PJHQ's J3 Operations staff. The JFHQ was described as 'capable of deploying into the field at very short notice,' by its first commander, Brigadier David Richards. Richards was appointed as Chief Joint Rapid Deployment Force Operations, and also to expand the concept that underpinned its creation, the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces.Anthony Stone, 'Joint approach to defence: Three into One Will Go,' Soldier magazine, May 1999, 36, and General David Richards, 'Taking Command: The Autobiography,' Headline Publishing Group, 2014, 95-97.

He was best known as the first full-time voice of baseball in Philadelphia. Early life Saam was born in Fort Worth, Texas, where he attended high school with Ben Hogan. He was the public address announcer at high school football games and began calling them on the radio even before he graduated. While at Texas Christian University (where he was a classmate of Sammy Baugh), he broadcast Southwest Conference football games, many of which aired on CBS Radio's College Football Roundup. Ted Husing, CBS's main sportscaster, heard some of Saam's work and suggested that Saam apply for a job at WCCO in Minneapolis in 1934. The station asked him to do a baseball audition. While Saam had played baseball in high school, he'd never broadcast it before. However, he did well enough to get the job and soon became the station's lead sportscaster. He called the Triple A Minneapolis Millers, re- created the 1935 World Series, and called University of Minnesota football. In Philadelphia =First year= Moving to WCAU in Philadelphia in 1937, he called Temple, University of Pennsylvania and Villanova football games. He was soon noticed by the owners of both major league ballclubs in Philadelphia, the Athletics and the Phillies. =Phillies and Athletics= In 1938, Saam became the first full-time voice of the Athletics; he added the Phillies the next year and continued this double duty for 12 seasons. This was possible since both teams shared Shibe Park and almost never played at home on the same day. For most of Saam's tenure, the A's and Phillies were also-rans; indeed, he didn't call a winning team until 1947, with the A's. He was behind the microphone for over 4,000 losses‚Äîby one estimate, the most of any baseball announcer ever. His descriptive play-by-play flair earned Saam the nickname \\"The Man of a Zillion Words.\\" Although he lived in the Delaware Valley for the rest of his life, he always spoke with a soft Texas accent. After both Philadelphia teams began airing road games live in 1950, Saam was forced to drop one team since no radio station could handle the full load. He chose to drop the Phillies, since he and Athletics owner/manager Connie Mack had been longtime friends. As luck would have it, the 1950 Phillies won their first National League pennant in 35 years, while the A's finished with the worst record in baseball. Saam and partner Claude Haring did Athletics games until the team left for Kansas City after the 1954 season. =Later years with the Phillies= After the Athletics moved to Kansas City, Saam returned to the Phillies in 1955. He was joined by Bill Campbell in 1962; the pair was joined by former Phillies outfielder Richie Ashburn a year later. Campbell left in 1970 and was replaced by Harry Kalas. They broadcast Phillies games until Saam's retirement in 1975. Ironically, the year after Saam retired, the Phillies won the National League East, their first postseason appearance of any kind since 1950‚Äîmeaning that for the second time in his career, a case of bad timing had cost Saam a chance at calling a pennant or division winner. For this reason, Kalas and Ashburn invited Saam into the booth for the division- clinching game and let him call the last half-inning. The Phillies also added him to the broadcast team during the NLCS. Ashburn later said, \\"Thirty-eight years and no winner. Damn right he deserved a title.\\" Despite having never called a pennant or division winner in Philadelphia, Saam did call 13 no- hitters, including Jim Bunning's perfect game in 1964. He also broadcast the World Series for NBC Radio in and . While most announcers of his era were unabashed \\"homers\\", Saam rarely rooted for the Phillies and A's from the booth. In a book that he started but never finished before his death, he said that he \\"never felt it would serve any constructive purpose\\" to criticize umpires, even when it was obvious they'd missed a call. Campbell recalled that Saam's philosophy in life was \\"rolling along\\"; his composure never changed during big wins or losing streaks that seemed to last forever. =Other broadcasting areas= Away from baseball, he worked games for the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL and Philadelphia Warriors of the NBA. He was one of the broadcasters during Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Saam was also the first announcer of a nationally televised NFL game on Thanksgiving: he was at the microphone in Detroit on November 26, 1953 when the Lions beat the Green Bay Packers, 34-15. The game was carried on the now-defunct DuMont Network. Saam was also called games of the Eastern Hockey League's Philadelphia Ramblers: on January 8, 1961, the Ramblers visited the New York Rovers at the Long Island Arena with Saam broadcasting the third period and overtime back to Philadelphia. Saam was known for the occasional slip-up on the air. For example, he once opened a game by saying, \\"Hello, Byrum Saam, this is everybody speaking.\\" (This goof has also been credited to other announcers, including Lindsey Nelson and Phil Rizzuto.) Prior to Game 5 of the 1959 World Series, when Mel Allen introduced the NBC Radio audience to \\"amiable, affable, able Byrum Saam\\", a distracted Saam unthinkingly replied, \\"Right you are, Mel Allen.\\" Once, Saam created a beheading when Alex Johnson, the Phillies' left fielder, chased a fly ball: \\"Alex Johnson is going back. He's going back, back. His head hits the wall. He reaches down, picks it up, and throws into second base.\\" (Jerry Coleman made a similar statement about Dave Winfield in a San Diego Padres broadcast.) Later life In , Byrum Saam was awarded the Ford Frick Award by the Baseball Hall of Fame for excellence in broadcasting. Ashburn was later honored by the Hall of Fame as a player, and Kalas won the Frick Award in 2002. By Saam was inducted into the Philadelphia Broadcast Pioneers Hall of Fame in 1993. He took classes to learn the 'Philadelphia accent.' He had three children with his wife Anne and has six grandchildren, including Byrum \\"Jake\\" Saam. Saam died in 2000 in Devon, Pennsylvania.

University of Hertfordshire Press, Hatfield. CH (9 May 187425 November 1937) was an English theatrical producer and manager. She managed the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells theatres in London and ran an opera company, which became the English National Opera (ENO); a theatre company, which evolved into the English National Theatre; and a ballet company, which eventually became The Royal Ballet. Early years Lilian Baylis was born in Marylebone, London, Englandhttp://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales- births-1837-2006?firstname=lilian&lastname;=baylis&eventyear;=1874&eventyear;_offset=0 to parents Newton Baylis and Elizabeth (Liebe) Cons. She was the eldest of six children, and grew up surrounded by music and performance. Her mother was a successful vocalist and pianist, and Baylis's education was grounded in the arts; she began performing and teaching music at an early age. She attended St. Augustine's school, Kilburn. She also took violin lessons with leading professionals, such as John Tiplady Carrodus, who was principal first violin at Covent Garden. South Africa In 1891, the Baylis family emigrated to South Africa when their performance troupe \\"The Gypsy Revellers\\" were offered a long-term contract to tour and perform there. As a teenager Lilian played violin and mandolin in \\"The Gypsy Revellers\\". She also taught her mother's music and dance students. She earned a good living and played in many concerts. When Baylis fell ill and had to have an operation on her kidneys, her family became concerned for her heath, especially as the country was in turmoil after the Jameson Raid. Baylis returned to London to recuperate and her aunt Emma Cons offered her a job at The Royal Victoria Hall and Coffee Tavern (known as \\"The Old Vic\\"), which she managed. Having spent most of her adolescent years in South Africa, Baylis left behind her family, many close friends, and a fiance.  The Old Vic  Baylis assisted Emma Cons in running the Old Vic, and gradually took on more management duties running concerts, film shows, lecture programmes and variety shows. Following Cons' death in 1912, Baylis became lessee and obtained a theatre licence for the Royal Victoria Hall to begin staging theatrical performances. Initially Baylis was interested in opera, which she preferred to every other art form. She joined forces with Charles Corri to arrange and perform operas at the Old Vic with a small orchestra and limited resources. Plays were introduced to the Old Vic by Rosina Filippi, husband and wife team, Matheson Lang and Hutin Britton, and Sir Philip Ben Greet. The plays of William Shakespeare were often performed and Baylis claimed that the Old Vic had become the London 'Home of Shakespeare'. In the run up to the 300th anniversary of the publication of the First Folio Baylis produced all of Shakespeare's plays, even the ones she knew would be unlikely to generate many ticket sales. The tradition of doing Shakespeare at the Old Vic continued for many years and performers such as John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier were willing to work for low wages if they could play the great Shakespearean roles.Findlater, Richard (1975), Lilian Baylis: The Lady of the Old Vic. London: Allen Lane.Hamilton, Cecily and Baylis, Lilian (1926), The Old Vic. London: Cape. Sadler's Wells The Old Vic Theatre from the corner of Baylis Road. In 1925, Baylis began a campaign to re-open the derelict Sadler's Wells Theatre, something she finally achieved with a gala opening on 6 January 1931 of a production of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night starring John Gielgud as Malvolio and Ralph Richardson as Toby Belch. Acquiring Sadler's Wells enabled Baylis to develop her plans for a dance company, something she had wished to do since 1928 when she hired Ninette de Valois to improve the standard of dancing in operas and plays at the Old Vic. For several years the opera, drama and ballet companies known as the \\"Vic- Wells\\" companies, moved between the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells but by 1935 the ballet company, which now included Margot Fonteyn and Robert Helpmann, with guest appearances from Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin, tended to perform at Sadler's Wells. Musical direction was by Constant Lambert, and choreography for new works by de Valois and rising star Frederick Ashton. The ballet company's descendants today are the Royal Ballet and the Birmingham Royal Ballet. Today the Sadler's Wells Theatre is primarily a dance venue. Growing stars The Vic-Wells nurtured the careers of stars such as Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Peggy Ashcroft, Sybil Thorndike, Edith Evans, Alec Guinness, Michael Redgrave, Maurice Evans and Ralph Richardson, and became famous for stylish productions under the artistic directorship of Tyrone Guthrie during the 1930s. In 1937 Guthrie's production of Hamlet played at Elsinore/Helsing√∏r in Denmark, with Olivier in the title role, and Vivien Leigh as Ophelia. Gielgud's first performance as Hamlet in 1930 became the first Old Vic production to be transferred to the West End for a run. Baylis scored a casting coup in 1933 by featuring Charles Laughton at the theatre after he had become a worldwide name in the film The Private Life of Henry VIII. To exploit the audiences' interest in the film, she cast Laughton as Shakespeare's Henry VIII. Recognition and death Baylis was awarded an honorary master's degree from Oxford University for her work in the theatre in 1924, only the fourth such honour to be given to a woman by the university. In 1929 she was made a Companion of Honour (CH) for service to the nation. In 1934 Birmingham University awarded Baylis an honorary doctorate. A Greater London Council blue plaque commemorates Baylis at her home, 27 Stockwell Park Road in Stockwell, South London. and the Lilian Baylis Technology School, Kennington is so named in her honour. After a long illness, Baylis died of a heart attack on 25 November 1937, aged 63 in Lambeth, South London,http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales- deaths-1837-2007?firstname=lilian%20m&lastname;=baylis&eventyear;=1937&eventyear;_offset=1&yearofbirth;=1874&yearofbirth;_offset=0 the night before the Old Vic was to open a production of Macbeth starring Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson.Tanitch, Robert, \\"Olivier\\". Abbeville Press She was cremated at East London Cemetery and Crematorium, where her ashes were scattered at her own request. There is a memorial plaque for Lilian Baylis at the Actors' Church, St Paul's, in the heart of Covent Garden.  Influence  In 1985, English National Opera created an education and outreach department, naming it the Baylis Programme called in Lilian Baylis's honour. The Baylis Programme (now called ENO Baylis) was led for ten years by its founder directors Rebecca Meitlis and David Sulkin. Subsequent directors included Steve Moffitt and Alice King-Farlow. In the Lilian Baylis tradition the work of ENO Baylis focusses on those who are new to opera. It involves around 12,000 people every year in a wide range of projects, events, courses and performances, with a goal of developing creative responses to opera and music theatre; making new work with communities and exploring individual creativity as a means of providing access to ENO's productions; and encouraging learning and development through participation of artists and collaboration of resources. The current Sadler's Wells Theatre contains a 200-seat theatre named after her, and the National Theatre has a Lilian Baylis Terrace. The upper circle in the Old Vic is called the Lilian Baylis Circle. A building in West Hampstead used by ENO for rehearsals and production wardrobe is called Lilian Baylis House. In Vauxhall the Lillian Baylis Secondary School is also named in her honour. There is a Lilian Baylis Rose, and the Royal Victoria Hall Foundation administers the annual Lilian Baylis Awards for promising acting students. A street alongside Waterloo station is named Baylis Road.

The label was first named as Milos Music Belgium but just one record was released on the label.

The clubs were so commercial and American music just wasn't accepted. The guys that were importing records here, they went straight into the studio and created a bad cover of it. I didn't like that. I said 'Respect the artist. License it in, and let's have the original track'.

When asked in an interview with Clash Magazine in November 2009 why the label went on hiatus, Vandepapeliere explained, \\"I've been away because I was totally bored with the business side of music.

A few days later Brainstorm responded by saying: \\"We play our music to people, not flags, and we think that culture, just like sports, should stand over politics, as it's a direct link to people in the language of the heart.\\" On 1 December, BrainStorm's new DVD ‚Äú7 soƒºi svaiga gaisa‚Äù (‚Äú7 Steps of Fresh Air‚Äù), filmed during their Riga concert, was released. It is available in DVD format and a digital HD version. On the same day, the continuation of the 2016 local summer tour was announced and the date of the next concert - to be held on 20 August 2016 in Liepaja, at the Daugava Stadium. = 2016 = ‚ÄúBrainstorm‚Äù started the New Year announcing the first dates for the \\"7 Steps of fresh air\\" Spring Concert Tour in Europe. In total, they played 7 shows - 2 in the Baltic countries (Estonia and Lithuania) and 5 cities in the United Kingdom. On 23 January, \\"BrainStorm‚Äôs\\" song ‚ÄúZiemu apƒìst‚Äù was awarded as the most valuable song of 2015 at \\"Latvian Radio 2\\" annual award ceremony ‚ÄúMuzikƒÅlƒÅ Banka‚Äù. On 13 February, the IX annual award ceremony of ‚ÄúNashe Radio‚Äù was held in Russia and BrainStorm got awarded in the category ‚ÄúLeaders of the Chart‚Äù for the song ‚ÄúEpoha‚Äù. This song has been holding in the chart ‚Äú–ß–∞—Ä—Ç–æ–≤–∞ –¥—é–∂–∏–Ω–∞‚Äù for a record-long time ‚Äì almost 4 months, during which it reached the very top twice ‚Äì in July and August. On 15 February, \\"BrainStorm\\" released the song ‚ÄúLittle Raindrops‚Äù that is the English version of the previously released ‚ÄúZiemu apƒìst‚Äù from the album ‚Äú7 Steps of fresh Air‚Äù. The first live performance of ‚ÄúLittle Raindrops‚Äù was in the final show of the Lithuanian ‚ÄúX Factor‚Äù. In the annual Latvian Music Record Awards ceremony ‚ÄúZelta Mikrofons‚Äù (‚ÄúGolden Microphone‚Äù) \\"BrainStorm\\" received an award for their live concert ‚Äú7 Steps of Fresh Air‚Äù from the tour's final concert in Riga and an award for ‚ÄúAlfa song of the year‚Äù from the ‚ÄúAlfa‚Äù shopping centre. That is the only prize where the winner is determined by a public vote and so the song ‚ÄúZiemu apƒìst‚Äù got the most votes from the listeners, which brought the band their 31st Golden Microphone award in total. In the middle of the year, the band also participated in several music festivals, such as \\"–Ø–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä–Ω—ã–π –ü–ª—è–∂\\" (Amber Beach) in Kaliningrad, the festival \\"A-Fest\\" in Minsk and \\"Weekend Festival Baltic\\" in P√§rnu. On 20 August \\"BrainStorm\\" held their only concert in Latvia - stadium \\"Daugava\\", LiepƒÅja, gathering more than 28 000 people not only from Latvia but also the Baltic Countries, as well as the United States, Canada, Australia, Russia and even Japan. Demand for concert tickets was so great that even before the start of the concert, it was declared a sold-out. At the end of the year, \\"BrainStorm\\" went to Moscow with their solo concert. In 2015 the band presented their latest album ‚Äú7 Steps of fresh air‚Äù in the capital of Russia and it was very well received. During the year the songs from the album managed to not only rank the Russian radio charts but also resound in music festivals ‚Äì such as \\"Bosco Fresh Fest\\", \\"VK Fest\\", \\"A-Fest\\", \\"–ù–∞—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ\\", where \\"BrainStorm\\" performed as headliners. The documentary ‚ÄúBrainStorm: Between shores‚Äù got awarded with National cinematography award ‚ÄúLielais Kristaps‚Äù in the category ‚ÄúBest sound engineer‚Äù as well as Delfi.lv public choice award. = 2017 = The members of BrainStorm decided not to take a break to record a new album, whose preliminary release was scheduled for spring 2018, but to create new material in a rock-‚Äôn‚Äô-roll tour environment, while travelling and discovering new territories and cities. In the summer, the artists played at the Ukrainian festival Atlas Weekend and in the autumn went on a tour in Russia, which was named \\"–ú–µ–∂–¥—É –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥–∞–º–∏\\" (‚ÄúBetween Shores\\") and included the following cities: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Ekaterinburg, Tyumen, Omsk, Perm, Nizhny Novgorod. During breaks between performances and while travelling between the cities, the musicians created material for their album, as they were accompanied by the album's Swedish sound producers, who, being excellent musicians themselves, took an active part in the onstage performances. Prior to the start of the tour, Brainstorm presented the first single from their future album - the song \\"–ö–∞–∫ —è –∏—Å–∫–∞–ª —Ç–µ–±—è\\", recorded with Marina Kravets, the only female resident of the Comedy Club. Two more singles followed - the song \\"Tevis Dƒìƒº‚Äù, released in Latvia, and the international composition \\"My Mind‚Äôs So Lost (On You)\\". Within the framework of the autumn tour, special screenings of the documentary ‚ÄùBrainstorm: Between Shores‚Äù, organised by the cinema network Karo, took place in Russian cities. The ‚ÄúBetween Shores‚Äù tour was continued in April 2018 and was completed with the release of the new record. At the very end of 2017, Brainstorm announced their first performances of 2018 - a spring series of concerts in Great Britain, Ireland and Lithuania, a summer series in Latvia and participation in the festival ‚Äú–î–∏–∫–∞—è –ú—è—Ç–∞‚Äù. = 2018 = On April 25, PrƒÅta Vƒìtra released their 13th record with the title \\"About the Boy Who Plays the Tin Drum\\". It features songs in Russian, English and Latvian. To create the artwork for the new album, BrainStorm have yet again co-worked with the legendary photographer and director Anton Corbijn. On the eve of the record release, i.e. on 12 April, Brainstorm also released two new music videos. In the Russian-speaking territory and internationally, a video clip for the song \\"Wonderful Day\\" was released, whose fragments were shot at the International Space Station by the Roscosmos cosmonaut Sergey Ryazansky (–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –†—è–∑–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π). And in Latvia, a separate premiere took place - the main track from the album's Latvian version was released \\"Par to zƒìnu, kas sit skƒÅrda bungas\\" (\\"About the boy who plays the tin drums\\"). Prior to the album's release, the musicians announced their participation in two more summer festivals - ‚Äú–°—Ç–µ—Ä–µ–æ–ª–µ—Ç–æ‚Äù in Saint Petersburg and ‚Äú–ö–∏–Ω–æ–ø—Ä–æ–±—ã‚Äù in Okulovka, as well as the date of the Moscow presentation of the \\"Wonderful Day\\" album, to be held on 13 December in the Crocus City Hall. Apart from the musical announcements, BrainStorm pleased with the news about their participation in the Russian film \\"7 —É–∂–∏–Ω–æ–≤\\" (‚Äú7 Dinners\\") by the director Kirill Pletnev (–ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª –ü–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–µ–≤), to be released in early 2019, where the musicians played themselves in the culmination scene of this romantic comedy.

It was first published in 1969, with a second, revised edition published in 1975. Summary At the base of her argument, Rand asserts that one cannot create art without infusing a given work with one's own value judgments and personal philosophy. Even if the artist attempts to withhold moral overtones, the work becomes tinged with a deterministic or naturalistic message. The next logical step of Rand's argument is that the audience of any particular work cannot help but come away with some sense of a philosophical message, colored by his or her own personal values, ingrained into their psyche by whatever degree of emotional impact the work holds for them. Rand goes on to divide artistic endeavors into \\"valid\\" and \\"invalid\\" forms. (Photography, for example, is invalid to her (qua art form) because a camera merely records the world exactly as it is and has very limited, if any, capacity to carry a moral message beyond the photographer's choice of subject matter.) Art, to her, should always strive to elevate and idealize the human spirit. She specifically attacks Naturalism and Modernism in art, while upholding Romanticism (in the artistic sense, which Rand distinguishes from the philosophy also called Romanticism, which she strongly opposed). The first eleven of the book's twelve chapters were essays originally written for periodicals and an introduction to an edition of Victor Hugo, the final chapter is a short story entitled \\"The Simplest Thing in the World\\". Publication history Most of the essays in the book originally appeared in The Objectivist, except for the \\"Introduction to Ninety-Three\\", which was an introduction for an edition of the Victor Hugo novel. The first edition of the book, published by The World Publishing Company in 1969, was Rand's first book to be published after her break with her former prot√©g√© Nathaniel Branden, and unlike her two previous essay collections it did not contain material by Branden or any other authors besides Rand. A paperback edition was published by New American Library in 1971. The revised edition in 1975 added the essay \\"Art and Cognition\\". Reception Upon its initial release, The Romantic Manifesto received only a few reviews. Most of these were brief and negative, and even the longer reviews paid little attention to the details of Rand's aesthetic theory. From then until the late 1990s, The Romantic Manifesto and Rand's aesthetic theory in general received little attention, leading Rand scholar Chris Matthew Sciabarra to refer to it as \\"a nearly forgotten book in the Randian canon\\". One of the few exceptions was a 1986 journal article by literature professor Stephen D. Cox, in which he contrasted Rand's formal aesthetic theory from the book with her own practices as an author of fiction, arguing that her practice contradicted some of her theoretical points. Another exception was a chapter on Rand's aesthetics in Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand, a detailed presentation of her ideas by her friend and heir Leonard Peikoff. Overall this period was described by one later critic as a time of \\"benign neglect\\", when even Rand's admirers wrote little about her ideas on art. Mimi Reisel Gladstein described the book as \\"perhaps the most unified and coherent of Rand's nonfiction works.\\" However, the historian James Baker contrasted the book with Rand's approach in her book Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, most of which was written as a single work. Baker described The Romantic Manifesto as lacking the \\"systematic\\" approach of the other book. Barry Vacker said that while the book \\"offers unique and valuable insights\\", it fails to \\"present a complete philosophy of fine art.\\" As of 2008, the book had sold over 350,000 copies.

Early life Vickers was born in London on 3 June 1907, the eldest daughter of (Horace) Cecil Vickers (1882-1944), a stockbroker, and his wife, Lilian Munro Lambert Grose (1880-1923), a social worker, only daughter of Woodman Cole Grose, MBE, a civil servant. Her father's family came originally from Lincolnshire and her mother's from Cornwall. Her father joined Nelke, Phillips & Bendix, a London stockbroking firm who counted Edward VII as one of their clients. He was elected to the Stock Exchange on 25 March 1904 and became one of their partners at their office at 4 Moorgate Street. At the end of the First World War, all the German stockbrokers were forced to resign. In 1917 he set up his own firm, Vickers, da Costa, which counted Sir Winston Churchill among their clients. Her brother, Ralph Vickers was later Senior Partner of the firm. Vickers was educated at St Monica's, Burgh Heath, Surrey, and in Paris. She was trained as a Norland Nurse, working in the Margaret Macdonald and Mary Middleton Hospital, Notting Hill and was active in politics in Battersea and Islington. She was presented at court by Mrs Winston Churchill in 1926. She hunted in Leicestershire, rode horses for the Irish Free State Army to ladies classes and competed in the Dublin Horse Show as a jumper. She served with the Red Cross in South East Asia and was area welfare officer of the Social Welfare Department in Malaya. She was later chairman of the Anglo- Indonesian Society. She served as a London County Councillor 1937‚Äì45 and was UK delegate to the Status of Women Commission of the United Nations. Politics Seeking a career in politics, she went to see Winston Churchill at Chartwell. He told her he deeply disapproved of women in politics but advised her to wear a pretty hat and join the London County Council. In 1936 she was elected a Member of the Ladies' Grand Council of the Primrose League. In 1937 she was elected to the London County Council, representing the Norwood division of Lambeth, and serving until 1945. In 1939 she was nominated by the British Red Cross to serve as Divisional Secretary, Lambeth Division, and in 1940 similarly for Southwark. However, during the war, she was often abroad, repatriating prisoners of war. Overseas Vickers worked for 14 months with the Red Cross in Indonesia, four years in British Malaya (now Malaysia) as a Social Welfare Area Officer in Negri Sembilan, Malacca and Johore. She was nominated a member of the Legislative Council in Negri Sembilan. She was a founder member of the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind, and started the work in Malaysia, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and Kenya. More specifically, in August 1945, she signed up to serve as Chief Welfare Officer, S.E.A.C. with the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St John. In September 1945 she arrived with six other women in Batavia, primarily to help British troops but working not only in British hospitals but also in Dutch, Indonesian and Chinese hospitals. She left in November 1946, having given great help to troops and medical units. The Dutch Red Cross were most appreciative and she was awarded the Netherlands Red Cross Order of Merit (1946). She was appointed MBE (1946). From there she went to Malaya where she served as Area Welfare Officer, Department of Social Service from January 1947 to May 1948. She visited Singapore, New Zealand and Australia in the summer of 1948. Vickers, the only known female National Liberal politician nationally, unsuccessfully contested South Poplar at the 1945 general election. At the 1955 general election she was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Plymouth Devonport, defeating the Labour candidate, Michael Foot, by 100 votes. She defeated him again in 1959 by the greatly increased majority of 6,454. Her seat was always marginal, but she held it in the 1964, 1966 and 1970 elections. She was considered a dedicated constituency MP, taking a house in Devonport, travelling to and from the constituency every weekend and holding regular surgeries. She never became a Minister, possibly because she always voted on conscience rather than following the whip. She was appointed DBE in 1964. During her years as an MP, she not only addressed numerous women's issues, but also spoke on defence issues and was a zealous supporter of the Commonwealth, always keen to entertain visiting parliamentarians, parliamentary clerks from abroad, and overseas students. She was a UK delegate to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, and the Western European Union from 1967‚Äì74. Every year she was elected by all parties to a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. She sat on the UK COSA Committee. She was a working member of the International Friendship League. In her life as an MP, she visited all the major Commonwealth countries for conferences, and most of the Caribbean countries, including Guyana and Belize, as well as Fiji, Tonga and Ceylon. She was on the committee of the London Centre, to which members came from India and Jamaica. She sat until the February 1974 general election when she was defeated by Labour's David Owen. Peerage She was created a life peer, as Baroness Vickers, of Devonport in the County of Devon on 27 January 1975.

Biography  A major \\"dualist\\" religious leader, Miles allied himself with various groups that constituted the racist and anti-Semitic political-religious movement known as Christian Identity, including Aryan Nations, founding the \\"Mountain Church\\" on his property. Miles saw Earth as the site of a battle between a true God and a false god, with Jews acting as agents of the false God against the true \\"chosen people\\" that would be \\"white Aryans\\". According to political scientist Michael Barkun, his dualistic theology was important despite its idiosyncrasies, and \\"the avuncular Miles functioned as a kind of elder statesman of the racial movement\\". In 1971, Miles, former grand dragon of the Michigan Ku Klux Klan (KKK), was arrested for conspiring to bomb school buses in an attempt to stop the forced busing in Michigan. The media billed it as a \\"Klan trial\\" even though Miles had not been associated with the KKK for some time. He was later convicted and served his sentence. Following the \\"Greensboro Massacre\\" of anti-klan communist activists in 1979, \\"a number of previously antagonistic White Supremacist groups, including the Posse Comitatus and various Neo-Nazi and Klan factions, began having discussions about how they could formulate a common ideology. These different groups also conducted joint activities and even began establishing informal means of communication including computer bulletin boards and cable TV programs. Many of these groups embraced Christian Identity. Gradually, a White racist alliance emerged. Centers of this movement included the Michigan farm of pastor and former Klan leader Robert E.

The park was located in the heart of Manchester city centre adjacent to the Granada House building. The tour attracted over 5 million visitors, but visitor numbers were waning by the late 1990s and Granada television had to prioritise other parts of its business such as the failing ONdigital (ITV Digital) service. As a result, the Granada Studios Tour closed to the general public in 1999 and for good in 2001. The Coronation Street set ‚Äì part of the original theme park ‚Äì was temporarily re-opened to the public in April 2014 for a six-month period, and its popularity meant it stayed open until December 2015. History =Proposal= The park was the brainchild of Granada producer David Plowright, who had long been interested in developing the land around the Granada Studios complex in Manchester. Much of the land that Granada owned was derelict and underused. Plowright's aim was to create a 'Hollywood-on-the-Irwell', a reference to the River Irwell which runs through Manchester. The Granada Group hierarchy which was the parent of Granada Manchester were pessimistic about Plowright's plans. Fortunately for Plowright, he gained the support of the Granada Television hierarchy, such as John Williams and commercial director Chris Mather. A key part of the tour would be for visitors to walk down Coronation Street, but the Tour would also include the former bonded warehouse adjacent to the main Granada House building. Plowright ordered the renovation of the Victorian warehouse for the Studio Tour at a cost of ¬£3m. =Opening= The Granada Studios Tour opened in July 1988 and quickly surpassed all expectations. A feasibility study prior to its opening estimated first year visitor figures of 250,000 to 275,000, but within 8 months the Tour had 600,000 visitors. Overview The exterior of the complex was a New York street setting replicating Times Square, complete with yellow cabs, large neon advertisements and entertainers role-playing police officers. This area was the site of the first exterior set of Coronation Street, used from 1968 until 1982 (chosen for the Victorian viaduct which lay behind the New York facade). The guided tour itself, which lasted around an hour, comprised various mock sets from Granada productions including a recreation of Downing Street, the Sherlock Holmes-era Baker Street backlot set from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes series, and the giant room from Return of the Antelope, where furniture was designed on a much larger scale to create the illusion of small humans. The lounge of 'Home Farm' from Emmerdale, and the caf√© from Coronation Street were also mocked up for the tour. In the early days of the Tours, a bus took visitors through a mockup of Checkpoint Charlie, and then down Baker Street towards Coronation Street, where they disembarked. This feature was later discarded, and the Baker Street set had a warehouse-style building erected around the outdoor set, creating an indoor street. The focal point of the tour was the opportunity to walk down the actual cobbled street used in Coronation Street since 1982. The tour was closed on Mondays, as this was the day that the set was used for filming at the time. Tourists outside Coronation Street Rovers Return Inn. Live action shows were performed at intervals throughout each day, including a parody of a political debate in the House of Commons chamber set used for First Among Equals. This set was often used by other television productions wanting to set scenes in the Commons chamber, such as The New Statesman, and in 2002 was purchased by the scriptwriter Paul Abbott so that it could be used in his BBC drama serial State of Play. Abbott, himself a former Granada Television staff writer, bought it personally as the set would otherwise have been destroyed and he feared it would take too long to get the necessary money from the BBC. Abbott kept the set in storage in Oxford.Abbott, Paul. Audio commentary on the DVD release of State of Play. BBC Worldwide. BBCDVD 1493. Visitors could also enjoy a drink in a replica of the Rovers Return, the pub in Coronation Street. In the adjacent cafeteria, a mockup of the bar from Emmerdale's Woolpack was also included. Other attractions included the opportunity to appear in a special Coronation Street scene in the Rovers Return with the main characters, using the chroma key process. Also, a ride named MotionMaster was developed whereby people could watch a short adventure film while being strapped into chairs which moved in synchronisation with the action on the large screen. One such film was based upon the film Aliens, when the squad entered the base in a transporter. Latterly, other rides such as a single-person monorail called a \\"Solocoaster\\", and other fairground-style rides were installed, including a 3D film show. Granada Studios Tour had also featured the shop featured in Sooty & Co.. One of the country's most famous Wurlitzer organs made regular concert appearances in an \\"old-style\\" venue, but following the closure, was sold to Folly Farm in Tenby. Bill Bryson visited the Tours and talked about it in his book Notes from a Small Island. He praises highly the House of Commons show. =Closure= The Granada Studios Tour entrance lost its colour in 2011 and now bore the ITV logo. The embossed Granada is still present, the ITV logo has since been removed As the 1990s drew to a close, the theme park gradually fell into neglect and disrepair, and visitor numbers fell. Granada was going through a period of unprecedented change, and many of the company's divisions were sold off in the wake of OnDigital's collapse. The tour complex was seen as a loss-making enterprise and plans were made to close it, unbeknownst to the public at large, who always saw the Coronation Street visit as the most important part of the whole complex. The formation of 3sixtymedia, a joint venture facilities company based primarily at Granada's Quay Street studios and co-owned by BBC Resources and Granada, spelled the final end for the Tours, as the company moved into the bonded warehouse on the site, and started using some of the other buildings (such as the Starlight Theatre) for additional studio and warehousing space. For a short while before its final, abrupt closure, the complex was open only to pre-booked parties, such as corporate events, fan club visits, and Manchester Mardi Gras' \\"Treat on the Street\\", a themed night time event during the August Bank Holiday weekend. In 2000, one year after its closure, parts of the tour were demolished allowing Granada the opportunity to expand the set of Coronation Street. Work included a new viaduct (to allow filming on Rosamund Street without exposing the Quay Street Studios which run adjacent to the rear of the set), Roy's Rolls caf√©, the renovation of the derelict Graffiti Club into a new medical centre, a new building yard, two shops joining the caf√© and a few new houses. After the closure of the tour, the exterior set was seen more often in the soap. The former Baker Street building was turned into a new studio for Coronation Street, named Stage Two, containing more studio sets. In 2008, a rumour was circulated that ITV were considering reopening the tour as well as licensing real 'Rovers Return' pubs. These reports came to nothing, as it would have involved a considerable amount of site reorganisation, at a time when Granada were discussing a move to a smaller location in Trafford Park. In March 2009, it was announced Coronation Street would stay on the Quay Street site \\"for the foreseeable future\\". Also, Granada's studios had become the home of shows displaced by the reorganisation of the Yorkshire Television studios in Leeds, including Channel 4's Countdown. However, following a change of hands at ITV management, talks between ITV and The Peel Group for the move to Trafford Park site reopened in January 2010 leading to a deal which was finally announced in December 2010, under which Granada Television would vacate the Quay Street complex by 2013, and the area be sold off. In 2012, it was reported that an application for heritage listing had been made to English Heritage on the premise that the site was important to the cultural history of the North West and nationally. The application included the Coronation Street set and Granada House building where the majority of Granada programmes have been produced since 1962. However, in June 2012, English Heritage announced that the request for Listed status had been rejected. The Coronation Street set was reopened to the public from 2014 to 2015. Demolition In August 2015, developers Allied London submitted a planning application for \\"demolition of existing buildings and structures including Stage 1, Coronation Street set and Lot, The Stables and Stage 2 Extension\\", intending to begin building work in autumn 2016. Consent was granted for the South Village project ‚Äì a new neighbourhood of workshops, \\"innovative workspace\\", independent shops, 60 apartments and green space. , the replacement outdoor set for Coronation Street at MediaCityUK is open to the public.

It has a population of 66,246 and is known as \\"the city under Marko's Towers\\" because of its proximity to the towers of Prince Marko. Name View of Prilep and the surrounding mountains The name of the city comes from the Macedonian word \\"–ü—Ä–∏–ª–µ–ø\\" (meaning \\"sticky\\") and it showcases how the buildings were first built there, being near one another next to the Marko's Towers.

The city also produces a large quantity of Macedonian Bianco Sivec (pure white marble). Tobacco is one of Prilep's traditional cash crops and prospers in the Macedonian climate. Many of the world's largest cigarette makers, such as Marlboro, West and Camel use Prilep's tobacco in their cigarettes after it is processed in local factories such as Tutunski kombinat Prilep. A Tobacco Institute is established in the city in order to produce new types of tobacco and it was the first example of applying genetics to agriculture in the Balkans.. A Gentherm production plant is located in Prilep. Demographics The overwhelming majority of the city population is Macedonian; the Macedonian population at the last census counted 64,527. There is also a Romani minority, counting some 4,421 inhabitants, also Serbs (315) and Turks (254). History Kingdom of Prilep - Realm of Prince Marko A postcard of Prilep in 1915 Photo of a panoramic view of Prilep in 1930 Near Prilep, close to the village of ƒåepigovo, are the ruins of the ancient Macedonian city of Styberra (), first a town in Macedonia and later incorporated into the Roman Empire. Styberra, though razed by the Goths in 268, remained partly inhabited. The town was first mentioned as Prilap Ioannes Scylitzes, Synopsis of Histories (Œ£œçŒΩŒøœàŒπœÇ ·ºπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπ·ø∂ŒΩ) in 1014, as the place where Bulgarian Tsar Samuil allegedly had a heart attack upon seeing thousands of his soldiers had been blinded by the Byzantines after the Battle of Kleidion. Byzantium lost it to the Second Bulgarian Empire, but later retook it. Prilep was acquired in 1334 by Serbian King Du≈°an and after 1365 the town belonged to King Vuka≈°in, co-ruler of Du≈°an's son, Tzar Stefan Uro≈° V. After the death of Vuka≈°in in 1371, Prilep was ruled by his son Marko.John Van Antwerp Fine (1994). The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest. The University of Michigan Press. . pp. 288, 380‚Äì2. In 1395 it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, of which it remained a part of until 1913, when it was occupied by the Kingdom of Serbia. Prilep was a major center of the Bulgarian national revival in Western Macedonia in the 19th century.–®–∞–ª–¥–µ–≤, –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ. –ì—Ä–∞–¥ –ü—Ä–∏–ª–µ–ø –≤ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ –≤—ä–∑—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω–µ (1838 ‚Äì 1878 –≥–æ–¥.), –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1916, —Å. 4-70. One of the largest annual fairs in Macedonia was held in Prilep in the middle of the 19th century. European consulate exhibitions of 1887 estimate the population of Prilep to approximately 6.500 individuals, of which 4.000 were Bulgarians, 2.000 were Turks and the rest were Serbs with Greeks and Aromanians.HHS, PA, XXXVIII, t. 264, Saloniki, 7 September 1887, no. 88. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Prilep was part of the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. It was occupied by Bulgaria between 17 November 1915 and 25 September 1918 during World War I. In 1918 Prilep became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and from 1929 to 1941 it was part of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. On 8 April 1941, just two days after the start of the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, Prilep was occupied by the German Army, and on 26 April 1941 by the Bulgarian Army. Together with most of Vardar Macedonia, Prilep was annexed by the Kingdom of Bulgaria from 1941 to 1944. On 9 September 1944 Prilep was briefly occupied by Yugoslav Partisans, but the German Army soon retook the town. Prilep was definitively taken by communist partisans on 3 November 1944. From 1944 to 1991 the town belonged to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as part of its constituent Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Since 1991 the town has been part of the Republic of Macedonia. Culture The mountain over Prilep -Zlatovrv Church of the Annunciation in Prilep * One of the most important institutions in the city is the Institute of Old Slavic Culture. * An art colony is hosted in the center of Prilep in the Center of Contemporary Visual Arts. The colony was founded in 1957 by the archaeologist Prof. Bo≈°ko Babiƒá, but organized by the initiative of Prof. Babiƒá and the academic painter Prof. Risto Lozanovski, making it perhaps one of the oldest colonies in southeastern Europe and the oldest one on the Balkans, for sure. It hosts painters and sculptors (working in marble, metal and wood) every year and, periodically, it hosts workshops and symposia for vitrage (glass design), mosaics, photography, graphics and clay, from countries around the world. The collection of sculptures carved in wood was acknowledged as a cultural heritage by the most relevant criticizers and opinion makers. 2007 was the 50th anniversary of the colony. * Every year in October the International Children's Music Festival \\"Asterisks\\" brings together children from all over the world. * Every year the Professional Theatre Festival of Macedonia, honouring Vojdan Chernodrinski, who was born in village Selci near Struga and Debar. * The Monastery of Zrze and the Monastery of the Holy Archangel Michael which has 12th and 14th-century frescoes are notable sites of the culture of Prilep. * Pivofest (Beer fest) is an annual four-day party held in the middle of July that attracts around 200,000 visitors to the city. There are international popular music acts performing nightly on the main stage in the square as well as at the various clubs around town. Pivofest features a growing number of foreign and domestic beers as well as an opportunity for Prilep to showcase its famous barbecue considered the best in North Macedonia. * Prochka is a centuries-old religious holiday of forgiveness and celebration that in 2001 found an organized manifestation as \\"Prilep Carnival\\" and has been a member of the Federation of European Carnival Cities since 2006. Despite the new official name, the festival is still known as Prochka by the locals and is called Prochka in the official tourist guide. The highlight of the festival is the mask parade which runs through the centre of the town and hosts participants from multiple European countries. There is a prize given for the best costume and many of the costumes are elaborate. There are also concerts, parties, and much traditional food during the festival which is held in February. Language The dialect of Prilep, in the heart of the Pelagonian plain, forms the basis for the standard Macedonian language spoken today. When the Socialist Republic of Macedonia was created in Yugoslavia in 1944 and the language nationally recognised the following year, Prilep, together with Veles, was chosen as the centre for the language because of their central position on the Macedonian map. Art and Architecture The Clock Tower in Prilep The Clock Tower in the 1920s Prilep railway station The main square in Prilep is called \\"Alexandria\\", in honor of Alexander the Great. The reconstruction of the square began in 2005 and it was completed in 2006. The reconstruction cost 700.000 Euros and its investor was the city of Prilep. During the reconstruction the monument of Alexander the Great was erected, among the other things.Square \\"Alexandria\\" on prilep.gov.mk Several ancient sites grace Prilep including one at Markovi Kuli, St. Nicola's church from the 13th century, St. Uspenie church in Bogorodica, St. Preobrazenie church and the Tomb of the Unconquered, and a memorial in honour of the victims of fascism located in Prilep's central park. A large Roman necropolis is known there and parts of numerous walls have been found; the settlement was probably the ancient CeramiaeMarijiana Ricl, \\"New Greek Inscriptions from Pelagonia and Derriopos\\" Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik 101 (1994) 151‚Äì163 mentioned in the Peutinger Table. Roman remains can also be found near the Varosh monastery, built on the steep slopes of the hill, which was later inhabited by a medieval community. Many early Roman funeral monuments, some with sculpted reliefs of the deceased or of the Thracian Rider and other inscribed monuments of an official nature, are in the courtyard of the church below the southern slope of Varosh. Some of the larger of those monuments were built into the walls of the church. The most important ancient monument is the old city of Styberra situated on Bedem hill near ƒåepigovo, in the central region of Pelagonia. As early as the time of the Roman‚ÄìMacedonian wars, this city was known as a base from which the Macedonian king Perseus of Macedon set out to conquer the Penestian cities. An important site in the area is Bela Crkva, west of Styberra, where the town of Alkomenai was probably located. It was a stronghold of the Macedonian kings after it was rebuilt in the early Roman period and was at the Pelagonian entrance to a pass leading to Illyria. Part of the city wall, a gate, and a few buildings of the Roman period were uncovered here in excavations. All recent finds from these sites are in the Museum of the City of Prilep. The Treskavec monastery, built in the 12th century in the mountains about north of Prilep under Zlatovrv peak, at the edge of a small upland plain 1100 meters above sea level. Prilep has frescoes from the 14th and 15th centuries and is probably the site of the early Roman town of Kolobaise. The name of the early town is recorded on a long inscription on stone which deals with a local cult of Ephesian Artemis.IG X,2 2 233 Northern Greece (IG X), Macedonia, Pelagonia, Kolobaise (Treskavec) The inscription was reused as a base for a cross on top of one of the church domes. Other inscriptions at Treskavec include several 1st century Roman dedications to Apollo. The old fortress was used by the Romans, and later the Byzantines. After all, even Tsar Samuil came here after the defeat at Belasica in 1014. During the Middle Ages, after 1371, Prince Marko rebuilt the citadel extensively, making it an important military stronghold. Geography Prilep covers and is located in the northern Pelagonia plain, in the southern part of North Macedonia. Prilep is the seat of the Prilep municipality and access is gained via the A3/E65. It is (as the crow flies) from the capital Skopje, from Bitola, and from Kru≈°evo.

He was best known as the lead guitarist for the celtic punk band The Pogues and as the frontman for the 1970s punk rock band The Radiators from Space. Upon his death in 2013, Chevron was regarded as one of the most influential figures in Irish punk music.https://theimmortaljukebox.com/2016/03/17/philip-chevron- the-pogues-francis-ledwidge-the-music-of-longing/ Career Chevron grew up in Santry, a suburb of Dublin. Beginning in the late 1970s, he was lead singer and co-founder of the punk rock group The Radiators from Space, receiving some critical acclaim but little widespread popularity or financial success. Following a temporary breakup of the band in 1981, he lived in London for a while, meeting and befriending Shane MacGowan through time spent working together at a record shop. Following the release of the Pogues' 1984 debut album Red Roses For Me, he was invited to join the band on a short-term basis as cover for banjo player Jem Finer's paternity leave. He took over as guitarist following MacGowan's decision to concentrate on singing‚Äîthereby becoming a full-time member of the band in time for the recording of its second album, Rum, Sodomy and the Lash. Chevron wrote the songs \\"Thousands Are Sailing\\" and \\"Lorelei\\" among others. He left The Pogues in 1994 following problems with drugs and alcohol.https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/09/philip-chevron In 2003, he reformed The Radiators (Plan 9) with ex-Pogues bassist Cait O'Riordan. They released the album Trouble Pilgrim in 2006. In later years, he became The Pogues' unofficial spokesperson and frequently visited online forums, answering questions from fans. In 2004, he oversaw the remastering and re- release of The Pogues' entire back catalogue on CD. He toured regularly with The Pogues, who reunited after a reunion tour in 2001. Personal life Chevron was openly gay and penned the anti-homophobia song \\"Under Clery's Clock\\", which was first performed in 1987 when The Radiators reformed for one gig, an AIDS benefit in Dublin, and released as a single in 1989. Illness and death In June 2007, The Pogues' website announced that Chevron had been diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. In early 2008, the website announced that Chevron had recovered, and that his hearing had returned to almost pre- treatment levels. He embarked on the March 2008 tour of the United States and sang \\"Thousands Are Sailing\\" at each performance. By 2009, Chevron was free of cancer. However, in May 2013, it was announced that the cancer had returned and Chevron was terminally ill. His last public appearance was at the Olympia Theatre for a fundraiser in August of the same year. Chevron died on 8 October 2013 in Dublin at age 56.

It came at a time of trouble and disillusion for the composer: a lawsuit, from which he was exonerated, and a reduction in salary. Dedicated to Karl von Stremayr, education minister in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the symphony has at times been nicknamed the \\"Tragic\\", the \\"Church of Faith\\" or the \\"Pizzicato\\"; Bruckner himself referred to it as the \\"Fantastic\\" without applying this or any other name formally. First performances The Fifth was first performed in public on two pianos by Joseph Schalk and Franz Zottmann on 20 April 1887 in the B√∂sendorfersaal in Vienna. The first orchestral performance ‚Äî in the inauthentic \\"Schalk version\\", with a changed orchestration in Wagnerian fashion and omitting 122 bars of the finale ‚Äî was conducted by Franz Schalk in Graz on 8 April 1894. Bruckner was sick and unable to attend. He in fact never heard this symphony performed by an orchestra.  Instrumentation  One pair each flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, with four horns, three trumpets, three trombones and one bass tuba along with timpani and strings. The tuba was added in 1878 (the same year Bruckner added one to his Fourth Symphony). See versions below. Structure The symphony is not outwardly a work of storm and stress, but it is a piece of \\"working out\\", one of Bruckner's most contrapuntally intricate works. There are four movements; the climax comes unusually late, in the chorale at the end of the last movement, posing a huge interpretive challenge: All but the third movement begin with pizzicato strings, hence the above-mentioned nickname. The pizzicato figures are symmetrical in the sense that the outer movements share one figure while the middle movements share another. =Jochum‚Äôs thoughts= Noted Bruckner conductor Eugen Jochum wrote in detail about the symphony's interpretive challenges, noting that, in contrast to the Seventh Symphony, ‚Äúthe climax‚Ä¶ is not merely in the last movement but at the very end, in the chorale.‚Ä¶ The first, second and third movements seem almost a‚Ä¶ vast preparation.‚Ä¶ The preparatory character applies especially to the first movement [whose] introduction ‚Ä¶ is a large-scale foundation‚Ä¶ destined to bear the weight of all four movements.‚ÄùEugen Jochum, trans. Mary Whittall, \\"The Interpretation of Bruckner's Symphonies\\", notes to Anton Bruckner: 9 Symphonien, Deutsche Grammophon CD 429 079 As evidence, he detailed the way... the introduction's thematic materials function in later movements, and said the interpreter ‚Äúmust direct everything towards the Finale and its ending‚Ä¶ and continually keep something in reserve for the conclusion.‚Äù Jochum also detailed tempo and its relationships and modifications as an element in achieving overall direction and unity, and regarded the quarter notes in the first-movement introduction as ‚Äúthe fundamental tempo.‚Äù Also, he wrote that in the Finale's double fugue, ‚Äúit is not enough to bring out themes as such [because] subsidiary parts would be too loud.‚Äù To get the desired contrapuntal clarity, he detailed dynamic subtleties required. =First movement= The work begins with a majestic slow introduction which, although beginning in B major, traverses several keys: : \\\\relative c { ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"pizzicato strings\\" \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Adagio\\" 2 = 20 bes8 \\\\pp ^\\"pizz.\\" r8 a8 r8 g8 r8 f8 r8  e8 r8 f8 r8 g8 r8 a8 r8  } } This is the only one of Bruckner's symphonies to begin with a slow introduction, but all the others, except Symphony No. 1, begin with sections that are like introductions in tempo, easing into the main material, like the opening of Beethoven's Ninth. It eventually leans heavily toward D major without actually tonicizing it. The introduction progresses into a main movement in sonata form. After a climax in A major, the texture is thinned until only a violin tremolo remains. This tremolo, starts on A, then moves to D, suggesting that D will become a tonal focal point. Instead, the opening theme is in B minor: : \\\\relative c' { ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Allegro\\" 2 = 55 bes2 \\\\p des4 ( -> bes8. as16 )  ges2. ^\\"gezogen\\" \\\\< f4  e2 \\\\\\\\! \\\\> f4.. ( c'16  f2 \\\\\\\\! ) -! r2  } } Like much of Bruckner's music, this movement's exposition contains three main key regions instead of the usual two. The second theme group is in F minor, and comprises a small ternary form, with sections in F minor, D major, and F minor: : \\\\relative c' { ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"pizzicato strings\\" \\\\key f \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 50 8 ^\\"pizz.\\" \\\\p r8 r4 8 r8 8 r8  8 r8 r4 8 r8 r4  8 \\\\pp r8 8 r8 8 r8 8 r8  8 r8 8 r8 8 r8 r4  } } Bruckner introduces the third theme in an unprepared tonality (D major): : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 50 2 \\\\mf ( 4 4  4 4 8 8 8 8  4 8 8 8 8 8 8  4 ) r4 r2  } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 as,,8 \\\\p des4 f4 as4 c8 ~  c8 des4 as4 f4 des8  as8 es'4 as4 c4 es8 ~  % 4 es8 as4 r8 r2  } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 des,,,4. \\\\p ( as8 g4 ) -! ges4 -!  f4 -! r4 r2  as'4.

The coda begins in B minor, but eventually shifts to the parallel major mode. =Second movement= The main material of the Adagio and Scherzo movements is similar, although heard of course at different tempos and launching different developments. The Adagio primarily relies upon the alternation of two thematic sections, the first of which contains a metrical superimposition of six against four: : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Sehr langsam\\" 2 = 22 a2 ^\\\\markup \\\\italic { \\"dolce\\" } \\\\p ( d,4 \\\\< e4  f4 \\\\\\\\! \\\\> g4 e4 ) \\\\\\\\! r4  d'4 \\\\mf ( e,4 c'4 d,8 e8  f4 \\\\> e8 d8 e4 ) \\\\\\\\! r4  } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 \\\\times 2/3 { d,4 \\\\pp ^\\"pizz.\\" -. a4 -. cis4 -. } \\\\times 2/3 { d4 -. a4 -. e'4 -. }  \\\\times 2/3 { f4 -. a,4 -. g'4 -. } \\\\times 2/3 { e4 -. a,4 -. a'4 -. }  \\\\times 2/3 { bes,4 -. a'4 -. g4 -. } \\\\times 2/3 { a,4 -. f'4 -. e4 -. }  \\\\times 2/3 { d4 -. c4 -. bes4 -. } \\\\times 2/3 { a4 -. g4 -. a4 -. }  } >> } The second features a chorale on the strings: : \\\\relative c' { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Sehr kr√§ftig, markig\\" 2 = 22 c2 \\\\f g8( a16 g16 a8 b8 )  c4.( d8 e4 ) d8( e8)  f4. g8 a4 a4  e4.( f8 e4 ) r4  } ew Staff << ew Voice { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\stemDown \\\\clef bass \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 c,2 \\\\f b2  a2 g2  f2 d2  a'2. s4  } ew Voice { \\\\stemUp c2 d2  e2 e2  a2 a2  a8 ( e8) a2 r4  } >> >> } =Third movement= The Scherzo of this symphony is unique in all of Bruckner's scherzi; the scherzo is in a three-theme sonata form instead of the usual binary form. The movement opens at a high tempo before slowing down for the second theme (note the bassline is the same as the one that opens the Adagio): : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Molto vivace (Schnell)\\" 4 = 250 R2.*2 \\\\p  d2.

After this, the scherzo goes through its development and recapitulation, setting the stage for the trio: : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Im gleichen Tempo\\" 4 = 150 R2  r4 \\\\p bes4 ~ ->  bes4 \\\\< c4 -!  d4 -! es4 -!  f4 \\\\\\\\! \\\\> ( es8 d8  c4 ) r4 \\\\\\\\!

There must be something eerie about the whole. At the second tempo marking (\\"significantly slower\\"), a really high-spirited Upper Austrian peasant dance strikes up: here the crotchets marked with an arrow-head should be rather short and playfully marked, each note given a slight accent. In the Trio, too, especially in the piano section, the accents must be brief, light, and effervescent. The arrow- heads indicate actual staccati here: the quavers [eighth notes] on flutes and first violins before Letter A must be very light, dainty, and short. On the other hand, in the cello and double bass descent directly after Letter A, the arrow-heads signify a rounded line, and the notes marked with such must sound with audible vibrato and not be too short.\\" =Fourth movement= The long Finale opens in the same way as the first movement but veers off soon to gradually introduce new material which becomes the source of the themes of the Allegro moderato, another sonata form which contains in its course fugal and chorale sections of elaborate counterpoint. The hybridization of sonata form and fugal elements is a hallmark of this movement. The first theme group is treated as a fugue exposition with the main theme of the movement as its subject: :: \\\\relative c' { ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Allegro moderato\\" 4 = 120 bes4 -! -> bes,4 -! r4 a8. -> bes16  ces4 -! -> ces'4 -! r4 es8. -> des16  ces8. as16 ges8. f16 es4 -! -> f4 -! ->  bes,4 -! -> r4 r2  } } This is followed by a non-fugal second group based on the second theme of the Scherzo which functions as an episode: : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice { \\\\stemUp \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 88 as4 ^( f'8 ) es8 -! des4. _\\\\markup { \\\\italic {cresc.} } ^( es8 )  des4 ^( c8 ) -! des8 -! as'4 ^( es8 ) r8  bes8 ^( as'8 _\\\\markup { \\\\italic {cresc.} } ges8 ) -! f8 -! es4. ges16 f16  es4 ^( d8 ) -! es8 f8 -! r8 r4  } ew Voice { \\\\stemDown r2 \\\\p des,4 _( bes'8 ) -! es,8 -!  ges4. _( f8 ) d8 _( es8 bes'8 as8 )  ges8 \\\\p r8 r4 es8 _( des'8 ces8 ) c8  f,4. _( bes8 ) bes8 s4 s8  } >> ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 des,,8 \\\\p -. c8 -. des8 -. es8 -. e8 _\\\\markup { \\\\italic { poco a poco cresc. } } -. f8 -. ges8 -. g8 -.  as8 -. g8 -. as8 -. bes8 -. b8 -. c8 -. des8 -. c8 -.  es,8 \\\\p -. d8 -. es8 -. f8 -. ges8 _\\\\markup { \\\\italic { poco a poco cresc. } } -. g8 -. as8 -. a8 -.  bes8 -. a8 -. bes8 -. c8 -. d8 -. r8 r4  } >> } The third theme features prominent descending octaves, a gesture seen in the first theme: : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key f \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 120 f8 \\\\ff ( g,8 as8 bes8 ) c8 ( des8 es8 e8 )  f8 ( g,8 as8 bes8 ) c8 ( des8 es8 e8 )  f8 _\\\\markup{ \\\\italic { marcato } } g,8 as8 bes8 c8 des8 es8 e8  f8 g,8 as8 bes8 c8 des8 es8 e8  f8 e8 es8 des8 c8 bes8 a8 ges8  f8 e8 es8 des8 c8 c'8 b8 bes8  a8 es'8 d8 c8 bes8 a8 g'8 fis8  es8 d8 a8 bes8 c8 d8 e8 fis8  g8 r8 r4 r2  } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key f \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 f,2 \\\\ff _\\\\markup { \\\\italic { sempre marcato } } -! -> f,2 -!  r2 c'4. -> c8  f2 -> -! f,2 -!  r2 c'4. -> c8  f4 -> -! f,4 r2  f'4 -> -! f,4 -! -> r2  R1*3 } >> } Closing the exposition is a chorale gesture, which recalls the Dresden Amen: : \\\\relative c' { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key ges \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 90 r2 2 \\\\ff _^  2 _^ 2 _^  4 _^ 4 _^ 4 _^ 4 _^  4 -> r4 r2  } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key ges \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 r2 2 \\\\ff _^  2 ^^ 2 ^^  4 ^^ 4 _^ 4 _^ 4 _^  4 -> r4 r2  } >> } This thematic material is subsequently exploited in the development as the basis for a second fugue subject: : \\\\relative c' { ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 90 r2 c2 (  f,2 c'2  d4 e4 f4 dis4  e4 ) r4 r2  } } By bar 270, both fugal subjects are intoned concurrently. The simultaneous presentation of the fugal subject also occurs at the beginning of the recapitulation (bar 374). When the recapitulation‚Äôs third group begins, the first theme from the first movement is also presented; the first-movement material closes the symphony, contributing greatly to its cyclic properties. Versions =1876 version= This remains unpublished. In 1997 a first attempt at reconstruction ‚Äî by including in the Finale music from the \\"1876 First Concept\\" (Ed. Carragan) ‚Äî was recorded by Shunsaku Tsutsumi with the Shunyukai Symphony Orchestra. In 2008 Takanobu Kawasaki was able to assemble the original concepts (1875‚Äì1877) of the symphony from manuscripts Mus.Hs.19.477 and Mus.Hs.3162 at the Austrian National Library; these were recorded by Akira Naito with the Tokyo New City Orchestra. In the opinion of John F. Berky, Naito's recording \\"is the best available CD to present some of Bruckner‚Äôs early thoughts for this massive symphony.‚Äù In this version the symphony is scored without a bass tuba, and more prominence is given to the string instruments. The tempo of the Adagio introductions to Movements 1 and 4, and that of Movement 2, are scored alla breve, i.e. notably faster than in 1878. =1878 version= This is the version normally performed. It exists in almost identical editions by Robert Haas (published 1935) and Leopold Nowak (1951). The Nowak has been amended twice, in 1989 (the ‚ÄúSecond Revised Edition‚Äù) and 2005 (the ‚ÄúThird Revised Edition‚Äù). All of these are under the auspices of the MWV, the Musikwissenschaftlicher Verlag der Internationalen Bruckner-Gesellschaft in Vienna. Regardless of edition, the 1878 version is sometimes redundantly called the ‚ÄúOriginal Version,‚Äù perhaps to distinguish it from the inauthentic Schalk. Schalk‚Äôs published edition, 1896 This first published edition, heard at the work's 1894 premiere, was prepared by conductor Franz Schalk. It is unknown how much of its difference from Bruckner's 1878 version reflects Bruckner and how much Schalk, but 15 to 20 minutes of music is cut, and most of the changes were unapproved by the composer. Schalk made Bruckner's music sound Wagnerian by means of re- orchestration. Obvious differences occur in the coda of the Finale, where Schalk adds triangle and cymbals and an offstage brass band.  Discography  The first recording of any part of the symphony was made by Dol Dauber with his salon orchestra in 1928 for HMV; it included only the Scherzo, in an arrangement of the Schalk edition. The first of the complete work was made by Karl B√∂hm with the Dresden Staatskapelle in 1937 using the new Haas edition. (B√∂hm never returned to this music.) Jochum, in addition to broadcasts issued on CD, made four commercial recordings: the Haas edition in 1938 with the Hamburg Philharmonic for Telefunken; and the Nowak edition in 1958 with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra for Deutsche Grammophon, in 1964 with the Concertgebouworkest for Philips, and in 1980 with the Dresden Staatskapelle for EMI.Eugen Jochum ‚Äì Central Website, Recorded Legacy All known Recordings Conductor Kenneth Woods in his essay on Jochum quotes Herbert Glass: ‚Äúthe Fifth drove [Jochum] to distraction and he would regard his every performance of it as an interpretation-in-progress. In rehearsal, such doubts could sorely test an orchestra‚Äôs patience ‚Äî this despite his courtly, respectful treatment of his players.‚ÄùKenneth Woods, \\"Eugen Jochum- musician‚Äôs musician, maestro's maestro, Icon\\", 17 November 2012, blogpost at View from the Podium Also noteworthy is Bernard Haitink, who has recorded the symphony commercially three times. In 1971 he recorded the Haas edition with the Concertgebouworkest for Philips.Ottaway, Hugh, \\"Record Reviews: Bruckner Symphony No. 5. Concertgebouw Orchestra/Haitink\\" (September 1972). The Musical Times, 113 (1555): pp. 874‚Äì875. In 1988 he returned to the Haas edition, this time with the Vienna Philharmonic. Then, in 2010 he recorded the Nowak edition with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra for BR Klassik; this recording has won particular esteem.Radio 4 (NL), Diskotabel 16 January 2011 Sergiu Celibidache, Herbert von Karajan, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, Herbert Blomstedt and Daniel Barenboim are among other noted contributors to the Bruckner Fifth discography. Takashi Asahina, Japan's most-recorded musician, recorded the Bruckner Fifth numerous times. Norman Lebrecht has singled out Georg Tintner‚Äôs recording on Naxos Records as one of the 100 best discs of the century and credits it with changing critics‚Äô attitude towards that record label: ‚ÄúIt actually sounds as if Tintner had been waiting all of his life to give this performance.‚ÄùNorman Lebrecht, \\"Masterpieces: 100 Milestones of the Recorded Century\\" The Life and Death of Classical Music. New York: Anchor Books (2007): 266 ‚Äì 267 ;Schalk edition As above-mentioned, Dol Dauber's recording was of the Scherzo alone. A few recordings of this complete edition are by Hans Knappertsbusch (twice), Takeo Noguchi, Richard Burgin, Leon Botstein and recent recordings by Warren Cohen and Hun-Joung Lim. In his recording with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra (Supraphon, 1973), Lovro von Mataƒçiƒá used a version which combined elements of the Nowak and Schalk versions. All other recordings are of 1878 version in either the Haas or one of the Nowak editions. =Selection of recordings= *Karl B√∂hm, Dresden Staatskapelle, 1937 ‚Äî Electrola DB 4486-4494 *Eugen Jochum, Hamburg Philharmonic, 1938 ‚Äî Telefunken E 2672/80 *Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Berlin Philharmonic, live 1942 ‚Äî Deutsche Grammophon 427 774-2 *Herbert von Karajan, Vienna Symphony Orchestra, live 1954 ‚Äî Orfeo C 231 901 A *Hans Knappertsbusch, Vienna Philharmonic, 1956 ‚Äî Decca SMB 25039 *Eugen Jochum, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orch., 1958 ‚Äî Deutsche Grammophon SLPM 138 004 *Eduard van Beinum, Concertgebouw Orchestra, 1959 ‚Äî Philips 456 249-2 *Hans Knappertsbusch, Munich Philharmonic, live 1959 ‚Äî Frequenz 051-038 *Eugen Jochum, Concertgebouw Orchestra, live at Ottobeuren 1964 ‚Äî Philips 6700 028 *Otto Klemperer, New Philharmonia Orchestra, 1967 ‚Äî Columbia SAX 5288/9 *Herbert von Karajan, Vienna Philharmonic, live in Salzburg 1969 ‚Äî Andante AND 2060 *Bernard Haitink, Concertgebouw Orchestra, 1971 ‚Äî Philips 6725 021 *G√ºnter Wand, K√∂lner Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester, live 1974 ‚Äî DHM 1C 153 19 9670-3 *Herbert von Karajan, Berlin Philharmonic, 1976 ‚Äî Deutsche Grammophon 2707 101 *Daniel Barenboim, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 1977 ‚Äî Deutsche Grammophon 2707 113 *Eugen Jochum, Dresden Staatskapelle, 1980 ‚Äî EMI CZS 7 62935-2 *Georg Solti, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 1980 ‚Äî Decca D221D-2 *Sergiu Celibidache, RSO Stuttgart, live 1981 ‚Äî Deutsche Grammophon 459 666-2 *Bernard Haitink, Vienna Philharmonic, 1988 ‚Äî Philips 422 342-2 *G√ºnter Wand, NDR Sinfonieorchester, live 1989 ‚Äî RCA RD 60361 *Kurt Eichhorn, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orch., live at St Florian 1990 ‚Äî Capriccio 10 609 *Daniel Barenboim, Berlin Philharmonic, 1991 ‚Äî Teldec 9031 73271-2 *Riccardo Chailly, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, 1991 ‚Äî Decca 433 819-2 *G√ºnter Wand, Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, live 1991 ‚Äî Profil H√§nssler PH 09042 *Claudio Abbado, Vienna Philharmonic, live 1993 ‚Äî Deutsche Grammophon 445 879-2 *Sergiu Celibidache, Munich Philharmonic, live 1993 ‚Äî EMI 7243 5 56691 2-4 *Takashi Asahina - Osaka Philharmonic, live 1998 - Tokyo FM - TFMC-0005 *Takeo Noguchi, Furtw√§ngler Institute Philharmonic Tokyo, live 1996 ‚Äî Wing WCD 115 *G√ºnter Wand, Berlin Philharmonic, live 1996 ‚Äî RCA 09026-68503-2 *Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, Saarbr√ºcken Radio Symphony Orchestra, 1996 ‚Äî Oehms OC 214 *Georg Tintner, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, 1996 ‚Äî Naxos 8.553452 *Leon Botstein, London Philharmonic, 1998 ‚Äî Telarc CD 80509 *Giuseppe Sinopoli, Dresden Staatskapelle, live 1999 ‚Äî Deutsche Grammophon 469 527-2 *Christian Thielemann, Munich Philharmonic, live 2004 ‚Äî Deutsche Grammophon 477 537-7 *Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Vienna Philharmonic, live 2004 ‚Äî RCA BVCC 34119 *Dennis Russell Davies, Bruckner-Orchester Linz, 2006 ‚Äî Arte Nova 88697 74977-2 *Herbert Blomstedt, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, live 2010 ‚Äî Querstand VKJK 1230 *Bernard Haitink, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, live 2010 ‚Äî BR Klassik SACD 900109 *Claudio Abbado, Lucerne Festival Orchestra, 2011 ‚Äî Accentus Video ACC 20243 *Gerd Schaller, Philharmonie Festiva, 2013 ‚Äî Profil H√§nssler PH 14020 *Christian Thielemann, Dresden Staatskapelle, 2013 ‚Äî C Major Video CME 717808 *Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, 2013 ‚Äî RCO Live Video 14103 *Stanis≈Çaw Skrowaczewski, London Philharmonic, live 2015 ‚Äî LPO 0090 *Simone Young, Hamburg Philharmonic, live 2015 ‚Äì Oehms OC 689  References   Sources  *Anton Bruckner, S√§mtliche Werke, Kritische Gesamtausgabe ‚Äì Band 5: V.

Built in 1993 by Finnyards in Rauma, Finland and operated by Arctia Offshore, she was the first Finnish icebreaker designed to be used as an escort icebreaker in the Baltic Sea during the winter months and in offshore construction projects during the open water season. Fennica has an identical sister ship, Nordica, built in 1994.  Design  = General characteristics = The maximum overall length of Fennica is and her length between perpendiculars is . The hull has a moulded breadth of and depth of . Her draught varies between as a Baltic icebreaker and in Arctic conditions and offshore work.Vapalahti, H: Finnish illustrated List of Ships 1999. Judicor Oy, 1999. The gross tonnage of Fennica is 9,392, net tonnage 2,818 and deadweight tonnage ranging between 1,650 and 4,800 tons depending on the draft. The ship weighs 7,935 tons and has a maximum displacement of 12,800 tons. Fennica is classified by Det Norske Veritas with a class notation 1A1 POLAR-10 Icebreaker Tug Supply Vessel SF HELDK EPR E0 DYNPOS-AUTR. Her ice class, POLAR-10, means that her hull is strengthened for unassisted operation in the Arctic, sub-Arctic and Antarctic regions, where the vessel can encounter winter ice with a nominal thickness of , pressure ridges, multi-year ice floes and glacial ice inclusions. The additional class notation \\"Icebreaker\\" states that she has no limitations for repeated ramming.Ships for navigation in ice, Pt.5 Ch.1 Sec.4 A303 . Det Norske Veritas, January 2005. To improve the maneuverability of the ship in ice her hull is wider at the bow than in the stern. These \\"reamers\\" increase the width of the ice channel and reduce friction between the hull and ice. The reamers are designed so that they create minimum additional resistance in the astern mode by breaking ice downwards. Soininen, H., Nyman, T., Riska, K., Lohi, P., & Harjula, A. (1993). The ice capability of the multipurpose icebreaker \\"Fennica\\" - Full scale results. In POAC 93 - The 12th International Conference on Port and Ocean Engineering under Artic Conditions: Proceedings Volume 1 (pp. 259-271). POAC Proceedings. In addition the forward part of the hull has explosion-welded stainless steel ice belt that reduces friction and protects the steel plates from abrasion. The aforementioned design with the maximum breadth in the foreship and a narrower hull aftship, provides the multipurpose vessel also good seakeeping characteristics. Traditionally icebreakers have had, due to their broad beam and relatively shallow hull, a very short roll period in waves, which makes working on board the vessel extremely difficult due to its violent motions.Tellefsen, T., Hagelstam, L. (1993). Development of multipurpose icebreaker and offshore construction vessel. In POAC 93 - The 12th International Conference on Port and Ocean Engineering under Artic Conditions: Proceedings Volume 1 (pp. 280-289). POAC Proceedings. In the design phase of the vessel, the seakeeping characteristics of the multipurpose icebreaker were defined to be at least as good as those of existing offshore vessels in the North Sea. Karppinen, T., Eronen, H., Lohi, P., Koivum√§ki, E. (1995). Seakeeping design of the new Finnish multipurpose icebreaker. In PRADS 95 - The 6th International Symposium on Practical Design of Ships and Mobile Units. Proceedings. The offshore operator set a requirement of acceptable acceleration figures at various locations of the vessel at zero speed. The vessel had to be able to operate at least 80 % of the time in the North Sea in the summer and autumn season plus have a roll period longer than 10 seconds. The solution with narrow breadth in the aftship results in a sufficiently long roll period. At the midship and aft ship area there are also exceptionally wide bilge shelves as an integral part of the hull, to further dampen the rolling. Moreover, the vessel is equipped with a U-shaped semi-active anti- rolling tank across the widest point of the bow section. The good seakeeping characteristics are an asset also in Arctic operations and long transit distances.Harjula, A., Eronen, H. (1994). MSV Fennica, new operational profile for an icebreaker. ICETECH '94, the Fifth International Conference on Ships and Marine Structures. Proceedings. For offshore construction projects Fennica is equipped with a Hydralift crane capable of lifting 30 tons at a radius of or 15 tons at . She also has a smaller MacGregor crane capable of lifting 5 tons at or 1.5 tons at . The vessel can also be equipped with a 120-ton A-frame for trenching machines and ploughs. Fennica has a helipad and can accommodate 48 workers in addition to the ship's crew. Before her helipad was rebuilt in 2012, she also had a small hangar capable of accommodating one helicopter for ice reconnaissance. Since Fennica acts as an escort icebreaker during the winter season, she is also equipped with a Aquamaster-Rauma anchor handling and towing winch, and stern notch for assisting merchant ships. The oblique bridge maximizes visibility from the starboard side steering position. = Power and propulsion = Fennica has a diesel-electric propulsion system with four main generators. She has two twelve-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ Vasa 12V32D and two sixteen-cylinder 16V32D four-stroke medium-speed diesel engines driving Str√∂mberg alternators, the former producing and the latter each. The main engines are also equipped with exhaust gas economizers. In late 2011 they were also retrofitted with catalytic converters and urea spraying systems to reduce NOx emissions in order to meet the strict EPA requirements.Significant reduction in the flue gas emissions of Fennica and Nordica . Arctia Shipping, 24 October 2011. While designed according to the power plant principle in which the main generators produce power for all shipboard consumers either directly or through a motor-generator, Fennica has one auxiliary diesel generator that can be used to produce electricity when the ship is at port. The four-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ Vasa 4R22 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engine has an output of at 1,000 rpm. In addition she has a twelve-cylinder Caterpillar 3412 DISA emergency diesel generator with an output of at 1,500 rpm. While underway, the fuel consumption of the main engines is 42 tons of heavy fuel oil or diesel per day at or 30 tons per day at , giving the vessel an operating time of 45 to 67 days depending on the speed. During dynamic positioning operations the fuel consumption is 15 tons per day and the operating time depends on the distance and speed of transit to location.Vessel specification: Fennica . Arctia Shipping. In late 2011 the fuel system was converted for the use of ultra-low-sulfur diesel. Fennica is propelled by two Aquamaster US ARC 1 Z-drive azimuth thrusters with ducted fixed-pitch stainless steel propellers. The 177-tonOjalehto, M.

This is especially useful during escort and assistance operations in difficult ice conditions when the icebreaker has to operate at close proximity to other vessels at low speeds. When delivered, she was the first large icebreaker to be equipped with such propulsion system and her maneuverability was often described to be superior to older icebreakers with traditional shaftlines and rudders.Aquamaster-Rauma To Deliver Second Set Of Azimuthing Thrusters For Finnish Icebreaker Program. Maritime Reporter, August 1992. Page 22. Kauhanen, E. J√§√§t p√§reiksi, sitten kes√§t√∂ihin . Tiede 7/2003. Together with three 1,150 kW Brunvoll FU-80 LTC-2250 variable-pitch bow thrusters the azimuth thrusters also allow dynamic positioning during offshore operations. The maximum speed of Fennica is in open water. She can maintain a speed of on level ice and operate in continuous motion in level ice up to thick. Her bollard pull is 230 tons.  History  = Development and construction = The development of the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers began in the mid-1980s when the Finnish National Board of Navigation launched a project to find secondary uses for the new vessels it was planning to build as a replacement for some of the oldest icebreakers. Until then the Finnish icebreakers had been designed solely for escort operations in ice-infested waters and their specialized hull form was not suitable for open water. As a result the existing icebreakers had an effective operational time of only three to five months per year and spent the summer season moored at Katajanokka in Helsinki. A multipurpose application of the new icebreakers would thus result in a better utilization of the vessels and, assuming they were chartered by a commercial third party during the summer, improve the economics of the state-owned fleet.Tellefsen, T.P. Development of multipurpose icebreaker and offshore construction vessel. Design and Operation of Ships and Offshore Structures - Proceedings of the 1st International Conference Vol 1, pp. 221-231. WIT Press, 1993.Lohi, P. Multipurpose icebreakers for the Finnish National Board of Navigation. Design and Operation of Ships and Offshore Structures - Proceedings of the 1st International Conference Vol 1, pp. 233-240. WIT Press, 1993. However, the concept did not become reality until the early 1990s, when the Norwegian company Ugland Offshore AS (later DSND Offshore AS) became involved in the project to develop and construct multipurpose icebreakers that could be used for offshore operations in the oil fields during the summer months. The concept was developed by the Board of Navigation together with a Finnish consulting engineering company ILS.Sj√∂str√∂m, P-E. From the North Sea to the Arctic: Finstaship combines icebreaking and offshore . Scandinavian Shipping Gazette, 18 October 2006. The summer period operational profile of the vessel was defined by the offshore markets‚Äô needs. Most of all, there was a demand for vessels that could conduct flexible pipe and cable laying and trenching and ploughing of cables and pipelines. Other defined tasks were e.g. cable repair work, anchor handling and the moving of offshore oil drilling platforms, semi-submersible units, and other offshore units, and transportation of deck cargo. The operational area was defined as worldwide service concentrating to the Northern and Arctic areas. The contract for the construction of the first vessel with an option for a sister ship was signed with Finnyards in October 1991. The second vessel was ordered in June 1992. The first Finnish multipurpose icebreaker, Fennica, was delivered in 1993 and her sister ship, Nordica, in the following year. The new vessels replaced the aging four-screw icebreakers Tarmo and Varma which were sold to Estonia and Latvia, respectively. In 1997 a third multipurpose icebreaker was ordered from Finnyards. The ship, delivered in 1998 as Botnica, was slightly smaller than the previous Finnish multipurpose icebreakers and had several other differences, such as twelve Caterpillar high-speed diesel engines instead of medium-speed units and Azipod electric azimuth thrusters instead of the ducted Z-drive Aquamasters. In 2012, Botnica was sold to Port of Tallinn, Estonia. = Career = When Fennica entered service in 1993, it was agreed that the multipurpose icebreakers would be chartered for offshore duties about 180 days per year during the ice-free season. For the winter months, they would return to Finland for escort icebreaking duties in the Baltic Sea or, if there was no need to deploy the whole state-owned icebreaker fleet during particularly mild winters, for lay-up in a Finnish port. The exclusive right to charter the multipurpose icebreakers was given to Ugland Offshore AS and later DSND Offshore AS. In 2002, Halliburton Offshore and DSND combined their resources and the exclusive charter of the multipurpose icebreakers was transferred to the new company, Subsea 7, that held it until 2004. Following the reorganization of the Finnish Maritime Administration in 2004, the ownership and management of the state-owned vessels was transferred to a newly founded state-owned enterprise, Finstaship. Later a separate company, GDV Maritime AS, was established together with Norwegian partners and handled the global marketing of the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers until 2008. During this time, the focal point in the marketing of the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers shifted more to offshore activities and the ships returned to their home waters only if they were needed for icebreaking. In 2006, Fennica was the only Finnish multipurpose icebreaker to escort merchant ships in the Finnish waters during the winter months.Vuosikertomus 2006 . Finstaship. In 2010 Arctia Shipping, a state-owned limited company, took over the operations of Finstaship. The ownership and management of the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers was transferred to a subsidiary company, Arctia Offshore.Arktisten olosuhteiden erikoisosaaja. Arctia Shipping Oy. In October 2011, Arctia Offshore and the Finnish Transport Agency signed a five-year contract with an optional two-year extension regarding the use of the multipurpose icebreakers Fennica and Nordica in the Finnish waters during the winter months. Prior to this, Arctia Icebreaking had already signed a similar contract for the conventional Finnish icebreakers. In November 2011, Shell Oil Company signed a three-year contract with Arctia Offshore and chartered the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers Fennica and Nordica to serve as primary ice management vessels in the Chukchi Sea during the summer seasons. The primary purpose of Fennica would be to protect the drillship Noble Discoverer by steering large ice floes so that they don't endanger the drilling operation.Uusi luku suomalaisten j√§√§nmurtajien tarinaan: Monitoimimurtajat Fennica ja Nordica kes√§kausiksi Alaskan √∂ljykentille . Arctia Shipping, 2011. Information Sheet - Fennica. Shell Oil Company. The decision to charter the Finnish icebreakers to support Arctic offshore drilling has been widely criticized due potential environmental damage in case of oil spill. On 16 March 2012, some 52 Greenpeace activists from five different countries boarded Fennica and Nordica at Arctech Helsinki Shipyard to protest Shell's drilling operations in Alaska.Activists protest at Shell's Finnish icebreaker rental.

In November 2012, Fennica and her sister ship became the first Finnish icebreakers to sail through the Northern Sea Route when the vessels returned to Finland for the 2012 icebreaking season. During the transit, the multipurpose icebreakers were escorted by Russian nuclear-powered icebreakers Rossiya and Vaygach.Suomalaiset j√§√§nmurtajat matkaavat l√§pi Koillisv√§yl√§n . Arctia Shipping, 31 October 2012. In 2013, Fennica and Nordica returned to Finland via the Northern Sea Route for the second time. In 2015, after the decision from Shell to stop drilling in Alaska, Fennica and Nordica returned to Europe via the Northwest Passage. This late-season eastbound unescorted transit was the first time the Finnish icebreakers have sailed through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and was claimed to save both time and money. The ships arrived to Nuuk, Greenland, on 31 October 2015.Finnish icebreakers arrive in Greenland after late-season NW Passage transit. NunatsiaqOnline, 2 November 2015. = Incidents = On 2 July 2015, while underway to the Chukchi Sea to support Shell's drilling operations, Fennica struck an uncharted rock that created a long and about two inches () wide fracture in the Port No. 4 ballast tank. When the crew noticed that water level in the tank was rising, the icebreaker turned back and returned to Dutch Harbor for investigations.Report of Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Grounding of the Fennica on 07/02/2015.

On 13 July, it was announced that Fennica would head to Vigor Industrial dry dock in Portland, Oregon, for repairs.Shell icebreaker to be repaired at Vigor's Portland shipyard. MarineLog, 13 July 2015. This was not expected to delay Shell's plans to begin drilling in Northern Alaska as the capping stack, a critical piece of safety equipment carried by Fennica for shutting off the flow of fluids from an oil well in case of a blowout, would not be needed until later when the drill reaches depths where oil and gas are expected to be found.Shell's damaged Arctic drilling support ship heads to Oregon. Reuters, 13 July 2015. In Portland, Fennica was met by protesters who opposed Shell's plan to drill oil in the Arctic waters.

While the protesters were eventually removed, allowing the icebreaker to leave, Greenpeace claimed symbolic victory after the protest had forced the icebreaker to turn back and return to the shipyard earlier that day.Greenpeace protest: Controversial ship Fennica moves through protesters on St. Johns Bridge (live updates). Oregon Live, 30 July 2015. On 9 July, the United States Coast Guard announced that a boat from NOAAS Fairweather had followed Fennicas track from Dutch Harbor and discovered a previously uncharted rocky shoal where the sea depth was shallower than what was indicated in the nautical charts and about less than the draft of the icebreaker. = Controversies = In the early 2000s the managing director Ky√∂sti Vesterinen and several other high-ranking members of the Finnish Maritime Administration were caught in a bribery scandal when it was found out that DSND Offshore, the charterer of the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers, had offered them several private trips around the world. At the same time the offshore company, which had failed to make payments for the charters in time, was forgiven 153,000 euros of penalty interests. As a result, Vesterinen and two other officials were found guilty for corruption and as a result lost their positions, were given suspended sentences of four to ten months and had to pay back the unlawfully obtained benefits.Merenkulkulaitoksen lahjussyytteet julki.

The incident ended the co-operation between DSND and the Finnish Maritime Administration and left many people suspicious about the profitability of the multipurpose icebreakers. In October 2013, the Finnish media reported that Heidi Hautala (Green League), the Minister for International Development to the Finnish government and the minister responsible for ownership steering in the Prime Minister's Office, had instructed the state-owned Arctia Shipping to withdraw criminal charges against Greenpeace whose activists had boarded the company's multipurpose icebreakers in 2012. In addition, the head of the Government Ownership Steering Department, Pekka Timonen, had threatened two top executives of the company with firing unless they complied with the request. After providing conflicting accounts of the incident, Minister Hautala announced her resignation on 11 October 2013.Hautala aims sights at Europarliament. YLE, 12 October 2013. Timonen admits threatening icebreaker bosses. YLE, 11 October 2013. Later, several prominent people such as the Finnish Minister of Transport Merja Kyll√∂nen have again questioned the profitability of using the multipurpose icebreakers in offshore business and started a discussion of the future role of the Finnish state-owned icebreaker fleet in commercial work in the Arctic.Kyll√∂nen haluaa Arctiaan erityistilintarkastuksen. Helsingin Sanomat, 14 October 2013.  Criticism  The state-owned shipping company Arctia Shipping Oy and its predecessors have been heavily criticized over the years for the financial losses from the offshore business. Due to design compromises, the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers are unable to compete with purpose-built platform supply vessels ‚Äî the open-water performance of the spoon-shaped bow is very poor due to slamming. As a result, the ships have been left without contracts and have spent long periods of time in foreign ports even during the Finnish winter navigation season, forcing the Finnish Government to hire icebreakers from the commercial market to keep the ports open.15.11.2010 MOT: Italialaista j√§√§nmurtoa, toimittaja Magnus Berglund.

Nyt kutsutaan apuun jo yksitynenkin j√§√§nmurtaja . Kauppalehti, 03.02.2010. However, according to an internal memorandum of the Finnish Maritime Administration the offshore business, while not profitable, has covered at least some of the expenses from icebreaking during the winter seasons in the late 1990s, resulting in lower overall operating costs for the multipurpose icebreakers than for traditional icebreakers.Muistio: Monitoimimurtajien kannattavuus heikko . Helsingin Sanomat, 23 August 2000. Arctia Offshore also received criticism from environmental organizations such as Greenpeace after the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers were chartered for Shell Oil Company to support exploration drilling operations in the Arctic waters off Alaska where the consequences of an oil spill would be devastating. There have also been concerns about the legal liability in case of an oil spill after a report by the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy claimed that the Finnish State could be held liable and the compensations could include the entire property of Arctia Shipping, the state-owned shipping company that owns and operates the Finnish icebreaker fleet.Liability issues verified by agreement. Arctia Shipping, 26 April 2012. The Finnish multipurpose icebreakers have also been criticized for their (alleged) lower icebreaking capability when compared to traditional, purpose-built icebreakers such as those built in the 1970s and 1980s particularly in the Bothnian Bay ice conditions. The Aquamaster thrusters also require considerably more maintenance and the ducted propellers suffer from clogging when the icebreaker is operating in brash ice channels.Voelker, R. Trip Report to Northern Europe for National Science Foundation project. US Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration, April 22, 2003.

In this episode, a man acquires a stopwatch which can stop time. Opening narration Plot Patrick McNulty is a self-important, annoying bore in his 40s. One day, he is summoned by his boss. He is delighted, believing that his frequent contributions to the suggestion box have earned him recognition. His boss, however, says that all of McNulty's suggestions deal with fields of enterprise in which the company is not involved. The boss fires McNulty for wasting his time. McNulty goes to a bar, where he drives away the other patrons with his opinions about a sporting event. The bar owner requests that McNulty patronize another establishment. McNulty ignores him and buys a drink for the sole remaining patron, a drunk, who spews various phrases from times long past (\\"54-40 or Fight\\", \\"'E pluribus unum'\\", et al.). The drunk gives McNulty his stopwatch. Thinking it an odd gift, McNulty quickly discovers that it pauses the passage of time for everyone and everything, except the watch holder. McNulty tries to show his former boss the power of the stopwatch. McNulty says it can be used to make their company the largest in the world, but forgets that he cannot be heard when time is stopped. His boss does not understand and dismisses him. Before leaving, McNulty uses the stopwatch mischievously to rearrange random things in the office. Returning to the bar, he tries to demonstrate the power of the watch to the customers, but again does it in such a way that they do not understand. Later, McNulty stops time to rob a bank, but while carting out a pile of cash he drops the watch, breaking it. Time is now permanently frozen. With no way to repair it, McNulty runs around in a panic, begging the frozen people to talk or move.

It is the capital of the Ucayali region, the Coronel Portillo Province and the Calleria District. This city is categorized as the only metropolis in Ucayali, being the largest populated center of the region. According to the Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica e Inform√°tica, it is the tenth most populated city in Peru and in 2013 housed a population of 211,611 inhabitants. Although originally located in the district of Caller√≠a, in the 1980s it formed a conurbation with the towns of Puerto Callao (district of Yarinacocha) and San Fernando (district of Manantay, created in 2000). Most of the transport to Pucallpa is done through the Ucayali River, located in the central east of Peru and which contains the second most important river port in the Amazon (behind Iquitos). The Federico Basadrees highway is the main center of land transportation and connects the northwest of the city with the Captain Rolden International Airport (Aeropuerto Internacional Capit√°n FAP David Abensur Rengifo), where flights are made to Brazil. The economy of Pucallpa is based on trade, the timber industry and tourism. Among the main attractions of the city include ecological tourism, such as the Parque Natural, or cultural tourism, in the case of shamanism. Its main economic activities are fishing, agriculture, livestock and timber extraction. In addition, a small oil refinery near the Pachitea River and a gas refinery in the Curiman√° District supply fuel to the city and the center of the country. The first human inhabitants of the region were the Pano, who inhabited the entire length of the Ucayali River and its tributaries 3 millennia before being colonized. History and transportation Pucallpa was founded in the 1840s by Franciscan missionaries who settled several families of the Shipibo-Conibo ethnic group. Alberto Tauro del Pino, Enciclopedia Ilustrada del Per√∫, vol. XIII, p. 2129. For several decades it remained a small settlement as it was isolated from the rest of the country by the Amazon Rainforest and the Andes mountain range. From the 1880s through the 1920s a railway project to connect Pucallpa with the rest of the country via the Ferrocarril Central Andino was started and dropped several times until it was finally abandoned. Pucallpa's isolation finally ended in 1945 with the completion of a highway to Lima through Tingo Maria. The highway allowed the commercialization of regional products to the rest of the country, thus improving the economic outlook of the region and its capital, Pucallpa. However, the heavy rainfalls of the Amazon Rainforest remain a problem as they erode the highway and can even undermine it by causing flash floods. Pucallpa is served by air through the Captain Rolden International Airport and by river through its port Pucallpillo near the center of the city. During the high water season, the floating ports of La Hoyada and Puerto Italia are used for riverine communications. Pucallpa is connected by road to Lima via the cities Hu√°nuco and Cerro de Pasco. The San Lorenzo Megaport Project proposes to connect Lima with the Atlantic via a rail connection to Pucallpa and the Amazon. 960px  Climate  Pucallpa has a tropical monsoon climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Am).

In this episode, a dysfunctional family's problems are made worse when the child's doll proves to be not only sentient but also evil. Opening narration Plot Annabelle buys her daughter, Christie, a wind- up doll named \\"Talky Tina\\" in order to comfort her. The doll has a catchphrase: \\"My name is Talky Tina and I love you very much.\\" Annabelle has recently remarried to an infertile man named Erich Streator. Frustrated by his inability to have his own children with Annabelle, Erich directs his hostility toward Christie. Annabelle tries to persuade him that if he gives himself the chance, he will be able to love Christie. When Erich winds up the doll, it substitutes its catchphrase with antagonisms such as \\"I don't like you\\". At first, Erich blames the doll's manufacturer. However, when the doll begins engaging him in a more elaborate conversation, he comes to the conclusion that Annabelle is playing a trick to get back at him for his treatment of Christie. He places the doll in a trash can in the garage, but then receives a phone call and hears the doll's voice threatening to kill him. Checking the trash can, he finds it empty. He confronts Annabelle, but she pleads innocence. It occurs to Erich that since his wife was upstairs putting Christie to bed, she could not possibly have made the phone ring. He runs upstairs to find the doll in bed with Christie. Erich takes the doll away against Christie's tearful protests and angrily corrects her when she addresses him as \\"Daddy\\". He attempts to destroy the doll using a vise, a blow torch and a circular saw, all to no effect. He ties the doll in a burlap sack and returns it to the trash can, weighing the lid with bricks. Annabelle begins packing to leave, unable to tolerate his hostility and irrational behavior any longer. She says that Erich should see a psychiatrist. Erich begins to question whether the doll talking to him was just his imagination, and he offers to return it to Christie if Annabelle will stay. He takes the doll out of the trash and returns it to Christie. Later that night, Erich is awakened by muffled noises. He tells Annabelle to stay in the bedroom and leaves to investigate. Christie is in bed, but Tina is gone. Going down the stairs, he trips over Tina, who is lying on one of the treads, and falls, sustaining fatal injuries. Attracted by the noise, Annabelle sees Erich lying at the base of the staircase. Frantic, she rushes down and kneels beside his body. She finds Tina next to him. When Annabelle picks up Tina, the doll opens her eyes and says, \\"My name is Talky Tina...and you'd better be nice to me!\\" Annabelle drops the doll in horror, now realizing that her husband had been telling the truth. Closing narration Cast * Telly Savalas as Erich Streator * Mary LaRoche as Annabelle Streator * Tracy Stratford as Christie Streator * June Foray as Talky Tina (voice) Episode notes The score composed by Bernard Herrmann consists of a solo bass clarinet, flourished by harps and celesta. This ensemble creates the sinister tone appropriate for the episode's mood. The house in this episode also was used in \\"Ring-a-Ding Girl\\" (1963), another Twilight Zone episode.

Acorn was started in 1993 as a spin-off community of the older, larger Twin Oaks Community. In the early 1990s the Twin Oaks population swelled to capacity, with there still being many more people who wished to join. The pressure of the large number of people desiring to live in the community encouraged Twin Oaks members to form another community nearby to accommodate more people. This effort resulted in, on a 75 acre farm 7 miles away from Twin Oaks, the formation of Acorn. Community Group meetings are held weekly and decisions are reached through consensus. Members share a strong sense of environmental awareness, therefore they strive to live lightly on the land. Although structured in areas such as membership, policies are kept to a minimum; it is preferred that a calm anarchy prevail. Of the policies that are in place, the culture encourages personal responsibility rather than supervision. The community takes on issues on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind that needs are varied amongst individuals. The population and stability of Acorn has fluctuated significantly in its relatively short history. Financial crisis and interpersonal conflict have brought the community close to an end on a number of occasions. Having survived these difficult times, Acorn is now thriving (2013) as it enjoys a full membership of 30 members (currently its self-imposed maximum number) as well as the presence and participation of provisional members, interns and guests. There is also a waiting list of people who have been approved for membership and are waiting for space to become available. Acorn supports itself through its non-GMO heirloom seed business, Southern Exposure Seed Exchange. The income from this business is held in common and used to support Acorn's members, as well as a number of other activities (such as maintenance of a fund to support the formation of other cooperative egalitarian communities). In this vein Acorn purchased a nearby property in 2013, in order to form and support the growth of a new community, which is named Sapling. All members enjoy full medical, dental and optical care, as well as a monthly stipend. Acorn has a highly flexible self-directed labor system in keeping with its philosophy of non-hierarchy and personal independence coupled with personal responsibility. The work of the seed business is done by a dynamic and flexible collection of members and guests who attend to the necessary work tasks based on the varying needs of the business as well as the abilities and inclinations of the participants. Being non-hierarchical, there are no bosses, owners, investors, managers or supervisors to direct the work. Therefore work occurs with minimal supervision. Priorities are identified, and results achieved, by the input of those participants who have the most insight into what is required for the task to be done; this is coupled with the agreement and assumption of responsibility of the other participants. Membership The farm works in large part due to the fact that the community carefully chooses who becomes a member by a process called Clearness. After spending three weeks visiting the community, prospective members get \\"clear\\" with every single member of the community by meeting individually for in depth conversations. Then all members meet to decide whether or not to accept that person as a provisional member. The decision, like all decisions at Acorn, is made through consensus. Thus, all members must agree to accept the person as a provisional member. Failing full consensus for acceptance, the applicant is not invited to join. Once accepted, a person remains a provisional member for one year and then the full members decide whether or not to accept that person into full membership. Provisional membership is a trial membership and that person remains at Acorn so long as that person has the consent of all members to be there. If at any time full consent is withdrawn that person must leave. Once that person is accepted as a full member, full consensus is required for the community to require that person to leave. Diet Members of the community rotate cooking responsibilities, though cooking is done mostly by those who are experienced in it. The generally prepared meals often offer a meat dish, a number vegetarian dishes and maybe a vegan dish if vegans are present. The community raises and cares for chickens for meat and eggs; goats for meat and milk; and pigs for pork. Two meals per day are prepared by rotating cooks from within the community and most members attend most meals. The community does not buy factory farmed meat and purchases much of its food organically. Acorn is also successful in rescuing food which was destined for dumpsters by working with the local food bank on redistributing their surplus produce and by working with food delivery services to rescue their surpluses. Community service Members of Acorn are involved in various community service activities. These include Plant a Row (which grows food for local food pantry serving local disadvantaged persons) and Food Not Bombs. Acorn has also invested some money and considerable labor by volunteering to help two new local egalitarian communities Living Energy Farm and Sapling. The community also supports members who wish to pursue activism, especially as it relates to food safety and blocking the spread of GMOs including the March Against Monsanto. Labor Acorn has a minimum work quota of 42 hours a week, which all adult members are expected to meet. This is the minimum amount of work deemed acceptable, with most members working well over this amount. This quantity of work may seem excessive to some, but Acorn is a relatively new farm based community with a substantial amount of infrastructure waiting to be built out as well as a rapidly growing business that requires increasing input to meet that growth. All work done by members is equally creditable. Almost anything that needs to be done is considered work. This includes traditionally recognized work such as office work, maintenance and farming. However, less traditionally recognized work such as childcare, cooking, cleaning and preparing for communal parties are equally labor creditable. As a result of this system, members feel they have significantly more free time than when they were working regular jobs. Based upon meeting the minimum amount of work expected, members enjoy four weeks of vacation per year. By working over the expected quota members can accumulate additional vacation time. The labor system at Acorn is quite unstructured. However, this does not mean members simply do whatever they want and call it work. Keeping in mind the needs and goals of the community, as well as engaging in group and individual conversations, members identify and decide on relevant tasks that need to be accomplished. Individuals then step forward to take on the responsibility of accomplishing the work in a timely fashion. Monsanto lawsuit Acorn, with 82 other farmers and seed businesses, preemptively sued Monsanto Corporation to protect themselves from predatory lawsuits for GMO patent infringement. This suit is between Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association and Monsanto. This class action suit was litigated by the Public Patent Foundation in response to Monsanto's multiple lawsuits against farmers who have been contaminated by their GMO seeds. Buildings Living is communal rather than individuals living in their own houses. Each member is provided with their own bedroom in one of the four living structures. A new building which will provide much needed space for Acorn's growing seed business is under construction (2013). The building has a significant number of environmentally positive features which include low impact building materials, significant southern exposure, passive ventilation for cooling, timber frame construction technique and desiccant air conditioning for maintaining stored seed temperatures. The estimated completion is Fall of 2014. Image:Heartwood.jpgHeart Wood: A 13 bedroom custom built community house.

There are also a number of outbuildings including a wood shop, an auto shop, barns, greenhouses, seed processing facilities and long term seed storage freezers.

Applicants for jobs in the competitive civil service must compete with other applicants in open competition under the merit system administered by the Office of Personnel Management, unlike applicants in the excepted service and Senior Executive Service. There are several hiring authorities for the competitive service, including \\"traditional\\" competitive examining, as well as expedited procedures such as Direct Hire Authority and the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act. Notably, the procedures for firing and demoting a member of the competitive service are considerable in order to protect the employment rights of the member, yet to provide the employer (the US government) a fair and incremental method to manage employees. A written notice of thirty days, a statement of reasons for dismissal, and a right to a hearing must be granted. In 2015, 69.9% of the federal workforce was in the competitive service.  Legislative basis  According to U.S. Code Title 5 ¬ß2102, The \\"competitive service\\" consists of: #all civil service positions in the executive branch, except‚Äî ##positions which are specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute; ##positions to which appointments are made by nomination for confirmation by the United States Senate, unless the Senate otherwise directs; and ##positions in the Senior Executive Service.  Hiring authorities  A hiring authority is the law, executive order, or regulation that allows an agency to hire a person into the federal civil service. Competitive Examining is the \\"traditional\\" competitive hiring authority. Direct Hire Authority allows an expedited process for agencies to fill certain positions that have been deemed to have a severe candidate shortage or a critical hiring need. The Veterans Employment Opportunities Act allows eligible veterans to apply for certain positions. There are also hiring authorities for reappointments of both permanent and temporary positions. The following chart shows the number of hires for each of the top-used competitive service hiring authorities in fiscal year 2014: = Competitive examining = Competitive examining is the \\"traditional\\" method for making appointments to competitive service positions. It requires adherence to the full range of procedures and protections listed in Title 5 of the United States Code. Prior to 1996, the process of examining was largely centralized in the Civil Service Commission and later the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Two amendments in that year allowed examination authority to be delegated to individual federal agencies, and allowed OPM to charge fees to agencies for staffing services. As a result, by 2001 there were nearly 700 examining units across the government with OPM periodically reviewing their activity. Prior to 2010, competitive examining was subject to the \\"rule of three\\" where hiring managers could only select from the top three rated applicants. This was replaced in 2010 with \\"category rating\\", where applicants are sorted into two or more categories, and agencies make selections from within the highest quality category regardless of the number of candidates. = Direct Hire Authority = Direct Hire Authority allows an expedited process for agencies to fill certain positions that have been deemed to have a severe candidate shortage or a critical hiring need. It is authorized by and regulations are in . OPM determines which positions are eligible for Direct Hire Authority. Government- wide Direct Hire Authority as of 2019 applies to certain medical, scientific, and cybersecurity occupations, as well as positions involved in Iraqi reconstruction efforts. Agencies may also request to OPM that additional specific positions be filled through Direct Hire Authority. Direct Hire Authority expedites the typical hiring process by eliminating formal competitive rating and ranking procedures, such as the \\"rule of three\\" where hiring managers may select from only the top three rated candidates. In addition, veterans‚Äô preference does not apply. However, public notice requirements still apply, such as posting on USAJobs, as well as the one-year probationary period; and the appointee must meet all qualification requirements. Direct Hire Authority was first authorized by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. In 2003, medical, information security, and Iraqi reconstruction positions were announced as the first eligible government-wide position types. Veterinary positions were added in 2009. In 2018, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics positions as well as additional cybersecurity positions were added to the list.

The city, which lies at an elevation of in the broad valley of the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak river, is a moderately-sized trade center and industrial city, although the economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Rail repair shops and a thriving manufacturing industry of rugs, bricks, cement, and cotton and woolen textiles form the mainstays of the city's economy. The surrounding region is a cereal-producing area with large deposits of iron ore which are worked at Divriƒüi. Sivas is also a communications hub for the north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest trade routes to Iraq and Iran, respectively. With the development of railways, the city gained new economic importance as junction of important rail lines linking the cities of Ankara, Kayseri, Samsun, and Erzurum.

In 64 BC as part of his reorganization of Asia Minor after the Third Mithridatic War, Pompey the Great founded a city on the site called \\"Megalopolis\\".A.H.M. Jones, The Cities of the Eastern Roman Provinces, 2nd ed. (Oxford University Press, 1971), 159. Numismatic evidence suggests that Megalopolis changed its name in the last years of the 1st century BC to \\"Sebaste\\", which is the feminine form of the Greek name corresponding to Augustus. The name \\"Sivas\\" is the Turkish version deriving from the name Sebasteia, as the city was known during the late Roman (Byzantine) empire. Sebasteia became the capital of the province of Armenia Minor under the emperor Diocletian, was a town of some importance in the early history of the Christian Church; in the 4th century it was the home of Saint Blaise and Saint Peter of Sebaste, bishops of the town, and of Eustathius, one of the early founders of monasticism in Asia Minor. It was also the place of martyrdom of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste, also 4th century. Justinian I had a fortified wall around it rebuilt in the 6th century. Sebasteia was the first important city to be plundered by Turkish tribes in 1059. In August of that year the troops of various emirs gathered before the unwalled city. Initially they hesitated to sack it, mistaking that the domes of the several Christian churches were tents of military camps. As soon as they realized that the city was defenceless they burned it for eight days, slaughtered a large part of its population and took many prisoners.Speros Vryonis, The Decline of Medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor and the Process of Islamization from the Eleventh through the Fifteenth Century (University of California Press, 1971), p. 155 The city came under the domain of Turkmen Danishmend dynasty (1071‚Äì1174) after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. After the death of Dani≈ümend Gazi, Sivas passed to Nizamettin Yaƒüƒ±basan who won it after a struggle with Dani≈ümend Gazi's successors. In 1174, the city was captured by Seljuk ruler Kilij Arslan II and periodically served as capital of the Seljuk empire along with Konya. Under Seljuk rule, Sivas was an important center of trade along the silk road and site of a citadel, along with mosques and madrasahs (Islamic educational institutions), four of which survive today and one of which houses the Sivas Museum. Then it passed to the Ilkhanids, Eretna and Kadƒ± Burhanettin. Pa≈üa- Mosque at Atat√ºrk-boulevard The city was acquired by Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I (1389‚Äì1402). In 1398, Tamerlane swept into the area and his forces destroyed the city in 1400, after which it was recaptured by the Ottomans in 1408.Henry Hoyle Howorth: History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century, 2008, p. 166 Under the Ottomans, Sivas served as the administrative center of the province of Rum until about the late 19th century. The Armenian Apostolic Church maintained six Armenian churches in Sivas, being the Meryemana, Surp Sarkis, Surp Minas, Surp Prgitsh, Surp Hagop, Surp Kevork, four monasteries Surp Nschan, Surp Hreshdagabed, Surp Anabad, Surp Hntragadar, an Armenian Apostolic orphanage and several schools.

The deaths resulted in the Turkish government taking a harder stance against religious fanaticism, militant Islam, and antisecularism. In late 2006, there was a campaign by the Pir Sultan Abdal Cultural Institute to convert the former hotel into a museum to commemorate the tragedy, now known as the Sivas massacre.

It may have been the inspiration for the phoenix in Greek mythology. Roles According to Egyptian mythology, the Bennu was a self-created being said to have played a role in the creation of the world. It was said to be the ba of Ra and enabled the creative actions of Atum. It was said to have flown over the waters of Nun that existed before creation, landing on a rock and issuing a call that determined the nature of creation. It was also a symbol of rebirth and was therefore associated with Osiris. Some of the titles of the Bennu bird were \\"He Who Came Into Being by Himself\\", and \\"Lord of Jubilees\\"; the latter epithet referred to the belief that the Bennu periodically renewed itself like the sun. Its name is related to the Egyptian verb wbn, meaning \\"to rise in brilliance\\" or \\"to shine\\". Depiction The Pyramid Texts refer to the yellow wagtail as a symbol of Atum, and it may have been the original form of the Bennu bird. New Kingdom artwork shows the Bennu as a grey heron with a long beak and a two-feathered crest, sometimes perched on a benben stone (representing Ra) or in a willow tree (representing Osiris). Because of its connection with Osiris, it sometimes wears the Atef crown. A large species of heron, now extinct, lived on the Arabian Peninsula in comparatively recent times. It may have been the ultimate inspiration for the Bennu. Reflecting this, the species was described as the Bennu heron (Ardea bennuides). Worship Like Atum and Ra, the Bennu was probably worshipped in their cult center at Heliopolis. It also appears on funerary scarab amulets as a symbol of rebirth. Connection with the phoenix The Greek historian Herodotus, writing about Egypt in the fifth century BC, wrote that the people at Heliopolis described the phoenix to him. They said it lived for 500 years before dying, resuscitating, building a funerary egg with myrrh for the paternal corpse, and carrying it to the temple of the Sun at Heliopolis. His description of the phoenix likens it to an eagle with red and gold plumage, reminiscent of the sun. The theme of the fire, pyre and ashes of the dying bird developed long after Herodotus. The name of the phoenix could be derived from \\"Bennu\\", and its rebirth and connections with the sun resemble those of the Bennu bird, although Egyptian sources do not mention the bird's death. Ancient Egyptian depiction of Bennu deity on papyrus, possibly based on the Bennu heron Possible inspiration Remains of a giant, human-sized heron species, thought to have gone extinct around 1500 BC, have been discovered in the United Arab Emirates. It may have been the inspiration for the Bennu, so it has been named Bennu heron (Ardea bennuides).

He was an influential early composer of opera, and wrote the earliest opera on a historical subject: Sant'Alessio (1632). Biography Landi was born in Rome, the capital of the Papal States. In 1595 he joined the Collegio Germanico in Rome as a boy soprano, and he may have studied with Asprilio Pacelli. Landi took minor orders in 1599 and began studying at the Seminario Romano in 1602. He is mentioned in the Seminary's records as being the composer and director of a Carnival pastoral in 1607; and in 1611 his name appears as an organist and a singer, though he was already maestro di cappella at S Maria della Consolazione in 1614. Agostino Agazzari was maestro di cappella at the Seminario Romano, and he may have been one of Landi's teachers as well. In 1618 he had moved to the north of Italy, and published a book of five-voice madrigals at Venice; apparently he had acquired a post as maestro di cappella at Padua. In addition he wrote his first opera in Padua, La morte d'Orfeo. Most likely it was used as part of the festivities for a wedding. His experience in Padua and Venice was essential for developing his style, since there he made contact with the work of the progressive Venetian School composers, whose music was generally avoided in conservative Rome. 400px In 1620 Landi returned to Rome, where he spent the rest of his life, where his patrons included successively the Borghese family, Cardinal Maurizio of Savoy, and the Barberini family, who were to be his major employers throughout the late 1620s and 1630s, though he joined the papal choir in 1629 on half-salary. It was for the Barberini family that he wrote the work for which he is most famous, Sant'Alessio, in 1632, which was used to open the Teatro delle Quattro Fontane. Throughout this period he was compositionally prolific, writing masses, arias, and responsories, mostly in the seconda pratica style of the early Baroque, a decision which was controversial with some of the more conservative musicians, who thought the prima pratica -- the style of Palestrina -- more appropriate for sacred music. After about 1636 he began suffering ill-health, and he died at Rome in 1639 and was buried at Santa Maria in Vallicella. Music and influence Curiously, Landi's secular music is more conservative than most of his sacred music, and his first book of madrigals, for five voices and basso continuo, is almost indistinguishable in style from many late 16th-century collections, except for the basso continuo part. His other secular music consists of strophic airs, arias, and other songs for voice and basso continuo. Landi's masses, of which there are only two, are in the simple, 16th-century style encouraged (and sometimes demanded) by the Counter-Reformation. However he uses the Venetian concertato style for some of his motets, as well as his Magnificat and Vespers psalm settings, probably as a result of the years he spent in northern Italy. By far his most famous composition, and one of the most significant operas of the early Baroque, is his setting of the life of fifth-century Saint Alexis, Il Sant'Alessio. Not only is it the first opera to be written on a historical subject, but it carefully describes the inner life of the saint, and attempts psychological characterization of a type new to opera. Most of the interspersed comic scenes, however, are anachronistically (and hilariously) drawn from contemporary life in 17th-century Rome. The part of Sant'Alessio himself is extremely high, and was meant to be sung by a castrato. At the initial performance, half of the singers were from the papal choir, and there were several soprano parts sung by other castrati. The accompanying orchestra is up-to-date, dispensing with the archaic viols and using violins, cellos, harps, lutes, theorbos, and harpsichords. The opera includes introductory canzonas which function as overtures; indeed they are the first overtures in the history of opera. Dances and comic sections mix with serious arias, recitatives, and even a madrigalian lament, for an overall dramatic variety which was extremely effective, as attested by the frequent performances of the opera at the time. Sant'Alessio was one of the first staged dramatic works successfully to mix both the monodic and polyphonic styles.

It is calculated by dividing the number of shares sold short by the average daily trading volume, generally over the last 30 trading days. The ratio is used by fundamental and technical traders to identify trends. The days-to-cover ratio can also be calculated for an entire exchange to determine the sentiment of the market as a whole. If an exchange has a high days-to-cover ratio of around five or greater, this can be taken as a bearish signal, and vice versa. The short interest ratio is not to be confused with the short interest, a similar concept whereby the number of shares sold short is divided by the number of outstanding shares. The latter concept does not take liquidity into account. Short squeeze (a.k.a. Bear Squeeze) A short squeeze can occur if the price of stock with a high short interest begins to have increased demand and a strong upward trend. To cut their losses, short sellers may add to demand by buying shares to cover short positions, causing the share price to further escalate temporarily. In markets with an active options market short sellers can hedge against the risk of a short squeeze by buying call options.

The Erie Triangle land makes up a large portion of present-day Erie County, Pennsylvania. Most of northwestern Pennsylvania came under American control following the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix with the Iroquois Confederacy. The following year, a boundary dispute between New York and Pennsylvania erupted. Following a surveying effort by Andrew Ellicott representing the Pennsylvanians and James Clinton and Simeon DeWitt representing the New Yorkers, the western edge of New York was set at 20 miles (32 km) east of Pennsylvania's Presque Isle, a small peninsula off the coast of Erie, Pennsylvania. However, this left an unclaimed area, which came to be known as the Triangle Lands. The Triangle Lands problematically fell under neither New York's nor Pennsylvania's charter, while both Connecticut and Massachusetts also spoke up with claims derived from their original colonial \\"sea to shining sea\\" grants. Of these four competing claimants (Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts), only Pennsylvania was landlocked, except for a very tiny strip of coastline. Following some pressure from the new federal government, all four states surrendered their claims to that entity, which then, in 1792, turned around and sold final rights to the 202,187 acres (818.22 km¬≤) of land to Pennsylvania for $151,640.25 (75 ¬¢/acre). The Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy released the land to Pennsylvania in January 1789 for payments of $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. The Seneca Nation separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800.Nelson's Biographical Dictionary and Historical Reference Book of Erie County, Pennsylvania, Vol I, pp 103-04 This was accomplished without the approval of the federal government and in violation of the Contract ClauseArticle I, section 10, clause 1 of the United States Constitution which reserved the right to make treaties to the federal government.Andro Linklater, \\"The Fabric of America\\" pp 86 With this access to the Great Lakes, Pennsylvania was persuaded to accept the western boundary established by the Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory following passage of the Northwest Ordinance, in 1787. Cornerstone of the Erie Triangle The Erie Triangle is often described as a \\"tab\\" or \\"chimney\\" attached to the Keystone State. The water off the coast of the Erie Triangle is known as the Graveyard of Lake Erie because of the large number of shipwrecks that occurred in the area's stormy waters in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was also the site of a preliminary battle between forces that participated in the Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812. The battle itself took place in the Lake Erie Islands, at the western end of the lake, off the coast of Ohio.

Franz Rademacher, head of the Jewish Department of the German Foreign Office, proposed the idea in June 1940, shortly before the Fall of France. The proposal called for the handing over of control of Madagascar, then a French colony, to Germany as part of the eventual peace terms. The idea of re-settling Polish Jews in Madagascar was investigated by the Polish government in 1937, but the task force sent to evaluate the island's potential determined that only 5,000 to 7,000 families could be accommodated, or even as few as 500 families by some estimates. Because efforts by the Nazis to encourage the emigration of the Jewish population of Germany before World War II were only partially successful, the idea of deporting Jews to Madagascar was revived by the Nazi government in 1940. Rademacher recommended on 3 June 1940 that Madagascar should be made available as a destination for the Jews of Europe. With Adolf Hitler's approval, Adolf Eichmann released a memorandum on 15 August 1940 calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year for four years, with the island being governed as a police state under the SS. They assumed that many Jews would succumb to its harsh conditions should the plan be implemented. The plan was not viable due to the British naval blockade. It was postponed after the Nazis lost the Battle of Britain in September 1940, and it was permanently shelved in 1942 with the commencement of the Final Solution, the policy of systematic genocide of Jews, towards which it had functioned as an important psychological step. Origins Proposed sites under the 1937 French/Polish version of the plan In the late 1800s and early 1900s there were a number of resettlement plans for European Jews that were precursors to the Madagascar Plan. Paul de Lagarde, an Orientalist scholar, first suggested evacuating the European Jews to Madagascar in his 1878 work Deutsche Schriften (\\"German Writings\\"). Members of the Zionist movement in 1904‚Äì1905 seriously debated the British Uganda Programme, by which Russian Jews, who were in immediate danger from ongoing pogroms, would be settled in what today is Kenya. The plan was later rejected as unworkable by the Zionist Congress. Adherents of territorialism split off from the main Zionist movement and continued to search for a location where Jews might settle and create a state, or at least an autonomous area. The idea of Jewish resettlement in Madagascar was promoted by British antisemites Henry Hamilton Beamish, Arnold Leese, and others. With the cooperation of the French, the Polish government commissioned a task force in 1937 to examine the possibility of settling Polish Jews in the island. The head of the commission, , felt the island could accommodate 5,000 to 7,000 families, but Jewish members of the group estimated that, because of the climate and poor infrastructure, only 500 or even fewer families could safely be accommodated. In Nazi Germany Racism and antisemitism were basic tenets of the Nazi Party and the Nazi government. Discrimination and violent attacks against Jews began immediately after the seizure of power in 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazis to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Argentina, the United Kingdom, and other countries, as well as the British Mandate of Palestine. The Nazi leadership seized on the idea of deporting the remaining German Jews overseas. Barren, unproductive lands were viewed as appropriate destinations as this would prevent the deportees from flourishing in their new location. In his May 1940 memorandum to Hitler, Concerning the Treatment of the Alien Population in the East, Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler declared that he hoped to see \\"the term 'Jew' [...] completely eliminated through the massive immigration of all Jews to Africa or some other colony\\". =Planning begins= Initial discussions began to take place in 1938 among Nazi ideologues such as Julius Streicher, Hermann G√∂ring, Alfred Rosenberg, and Joachim von Ribbentrop. Ten percent of Jews under German jurisdiction by that date were Polish nationals. J√≥zef Lipski, the Polish ambassador to Germany, expressed his country's reluctance to take them back, and the Polish government decreed that Polish passport holders would not be permitted to return except under specific conditions. When Ribbentrop raised the matter with French foreign minister Georges Bonnet in December of that year, Bonnet expressed French reluctance to receive more German Jews and inquired if measures could be taken to prevent their arrival. France itself was contemplating how to deport some 10,000 Jews and considered whether Madagascar might be an appropriate destination. Planning for German deportations to Madagascar formally began in 1940. Franz Rademacher, recently appointed head of the Jewish Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, forwarded on 3 June to his superior, the diplomat Martin Luther, a memorandum on the fate of the Jews. Rademacher said: \\"The desirable solution is: all Jews out of Europe\\". He briefly considered Palestine as a destination, but deemed it unsuitable, as he considered it undesirable that a strong Jewish state should be created in the Middle East. As well, Palestine was at the time under British control. Rademacher recommended that the French colony of Madagascar should be made available as a destination for the Jews of Europe as one of the terms of the surrender of France, which the Germans had invaded on 10 May 1940. The resettled Jews, noted Rademacher, could be used as hostages to ensure \\"future good behaviour of their racial comrades in America\\". The plan was developed by Referat D III of the Abteilung Deutschland. Luther broached the subject with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was simultaneously developing a similar scheme. By 18 June, Hitler and Ribbentrop spoke of the Plan with Italian leader Benito Mussolini as a possibility that could be pursued after the defeat of France. Once he learned of the plan, SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), insisted that Ribbentrop relinquish any future responsibility for the Plan to that office. As Heydrich had been appointed by G√∂ring in January 1939 to oversee Jewish evacuation from German-occupied territory, the Jewish question was hence under his purview. Adolf Eichmann, head of the RSHA Sub- Department IV-B4, which dealt with Jewish affairs and evacuation, soon became involved. On 15 August, he released a memorandum titled Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt (Reich Main Security Office: Madagascar Project), calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year for four years and abandoning the idea of retaining any Jews in Europe. The RSHA, he emphasized, would control all aspects of the program. While Rademacher called for the colony to be under German control but self-governing under Jewish administration, Eichmann made it plain that he intended for the SS to control and oversee every aspect of life on the island, which they would govern as a police state. France surrendered on 22 June. Most Nazi bureaus, including the Foreign Office, the Security Police, and the Generalgouvernement pinned their hopes on the plan as the last chance to \\"solve the Jewish problem\\" through emigration. In particular, Hans Frank, governor of the General Government (the occupied portion of Poland), viewed the forced resettlement to Madagascar as being preferable to the heretofore piecemeal efforts at deportation into Poland. As of 10 July, deportations into Poland were cancelled and construction of the Warsaw ghetto was halted, since it appeared to be unnecessary. =Planning continues= Rademacher envisioned the founding of a European bank that would ultimately liquidate all European Jewish assets to pay for the plan. This bank would then play an intermediary role between Madagascar and the rest of the world, as Jews would not be allowed to interact financially with outsiders. G√∂ring's office of the Four Year Plan would oversee the administration of the plan's economics. Additionally, Rademacher foresaw roles for other government agencies. Ribbentrop's Foreign Affairs Ministry would negotiate terms with the French for the handover of Madagascar to Germany. It would also play a part in crafting other treaties to deal with Europe's Jews. Its Information Department, along with Joseph Goebbels and his Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, would control the flow of information at home and abroad. Viktor Brack, a division chief in the Chancellery of the F√ºhrer, would oversee transportation. The SS would undertake the expulsion of the Jews from Europe and govern the island as a police state. The Nazis expected that after the invasion of the United Kingdom in Operation Sea Lion that they would commandeer the British merchant fleet to transport the Jews to Madagascar. The Nazis expected many deportees to perish in the harsh conditions or die at the hands of the SS. The plan has been characterised by the historian Ian Kershaw as genocide by an alternative method. =Plan abandoned= With the failure to defeat the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain, the proposed invasion of the UK was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940. This meant the British merchant fleet would not be at Germany's disposal for use in evacuations, and planning for the Madagascar proposal stalled. In late August 1940, Rademacher entreated Ribbentrop to hold a meeting at his ministry to begin drawing up a panel of experts to consolidate the plan. Ribbentrop never responded. Likewise, Eichmann's memorandum languished with Heydrich, who never approved it. Establishment of ghettos in Warsaw and other cities in Poland resumed in August 1940. The plan was officially shelved within the Foreign Office in February 1942. British forces took the island from Vichy France in the Battle of Madagascar in November 1942 and control was transferred to the Free French. Once planning for Operation Barbarossa commenced, Hitler asked Himmler to draft a new plan for the elimination of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting the entire population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. The plan hinged on the rapid defeat of the Soviet forces. Once it became apparent that the war against the Soviet Union would drag on much longer than expected, Heydrich revised his plans to concentrate on the Jewish population then under Nazi control. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.

A process is any activity or combination of activities including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling or the on-site movement of highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) as defined by OSHA and the Environmental Protection Agency. Fourteen elements of OSHA's process safety management program Definition Process safety management system is an analytical tool focused on preventing releases of any substance defined as a \\"highly hazardous chemical\\" by the EPA or OSHA. Process Safety Management (PSMS) refers to a set of interrelated approaches to managing hazards associated with the process industries and is intended to reduce the frequency and severity of incidents resulting from releases of chemicals and other energy sources (US OSHA 1999). These standards are composed of organizational and operational procedures, design guidance, audit programs, and a host of other methods. Elements of process safety management system The process safety management system program is divided into 14 elements. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 1910.119 define all 14 elements of the process safety management system plan. * Process Safety Information * Process Hazard Analysis * Operating Procedures * Training * Contractors * Mechanical Integrity * Hot Work * Management of Change * Incident Investigation * Compliance Audits * Pre startup safety review * Emergency planning & Response * Trade secrets * Employee Participation All of those elements mentioned above are interlinked and interdependent. There is a tremendous interdependency of the various elements of PSM. All elements are related and are necessary to make up the entire PSM picture. Every element either contributes information to other elements for the completion or utilizes information from other elements in order to be completed. =Process safety information= Process safety information (PSI) might be considered the keystone of a PSM Program in that it tells you what you are dealing with from both the equipment and the process standpoint. In order to be in compliance with the OSHA PSMS regulations the process safety information should include information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process and information pertaining to the equipment in the process. Information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals in the process should consist of at least the following: * Toxicity information * Permissible exposure limit * Physical data * Reactivity data * Corrosivity data * Thermal and chemical stability data * Hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foreseeably occur. Information pertaining to the technology of the process should include at least the following: * A block flow diagram or simplified process flow diagram * Process chemistry and its properties * Maximum intended inventory * Safety upper and lower limits for such items as temperatures, pressures, flows or compositions * An evaluation of the consequences of deviations, including those affecting the safety and health of the employees Information pertaining to the equipment in the process should include the following: * Materials of construction * Piping and instrument diagram (P&IDs;) * Electrical classification * Relief system design and design basis * Ventilation system design * Design codes and standards employed * Material and energy balances for processes built after May 26, 1992 * Safety system (for example, interlocks, detection or suppression systems) The employer should document that equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP). For existing equipment designed and constructed in accordance with codes, standards or practices that are no longer in general use, the employer should determine and document that the equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested and operating in a safe manner. Compliance A process includes any group of vessels which are interconnected or separate and contain Highly Hazardous Chemicals (HHCs) which could be involved in a potential release. A process safety incident is the \\"Unexpected release of toxic, reactive, or flammable liquids and gases in processes involving highly hazardous chemicals. Incidents continue to occur in various industries that use highly hazardous chemicals which exhibit toxic, reactive, flammable, or even explosive properties, or may exhibit a combination of these properties. Regardless of the industry that uses these highly hazardous chemicals, there is a potential for an accidental release any time they are not properly controlled. This, in turn, creates the possibility of disaster. To help assure safe and healthy workplaces, OSHA has issued the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation (Title 29 of CFR Section 1910.119) which contains requirements for the management of hazards associated with processes using highly hazardous chemicals.\\" Any facility that stores or uses a defined \\"highly hazardous chemical\\" must comply with OSHA's process safety management (PSM) regulations as well as the quite similar United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk management program (RMP) regulations (Title 40 CFR Part 68). The EPA has published a model RMP plan for an ammonia refrigeration facility which provides excellent guidance on how to comply with either OSHA's PSM regulations or the EPA's RMP regulations. The Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) has published a widely used book that explains various methods for identifying hazards in industrial facilities and quantifying their potential severity. Appendix D of the OSHA's PSM regulations endorses the use of the methods explained in that book. AIChE publishes additional guidelines for process safety documentation, implementing process safety management systems, and the Center for Chemical Process Safety publishes an engineering design for process safety. In Australia, consideration of process safety management is a key consideration for the management of major hazard facilities (MHFs).

Nazrul Geeti incorporate revolutionary notions as well as more spiritual, philosophical and romantic themes. Nazrul wrote and composed nearly 4,000 songs (including gramophone records), which are widely popular in Bangladesh and India. Some of the most notable Nazrul Geeti include Notuner Gaan, the national marching song of Bangladesh and O Mon Romzaner Oi Rozar Sheshe, an Islamic song on the festival of Eid-ul-Fitr. Background Nazrul showed the symptoms of keen poetic and musical talent at his tender age and started writing songs when he was a member of a Leto group (Folk Musical Group). Following Kazi Bazle Karim, his uncle and a leader of a Leto group, he became an expert in composing songs and setting them to tunes. Joining the Leto group enhanced his musical career and put a significant impact on shaping his future musical life. At a very young age he was excelled in composing songs in different languages, apart from the Bengali language. He met Satish Kanjilal, a teacher of Searsol School who had an interest in classical music and some mastery over it. Observing Nazrul's irresistible inclination to music, Mr. Kanjilal imparted him some lessons on classical music. Later Nazrul widened his knowledge on music when he was serving as a Havilder in Karachi Barrack under Bengal Regiment. He learned a great deal of Persian language, literature, and music with the help of a religious teacher from Punjab attached with the regiment. Nazrul Islam's musical style =Revolutionary Mass music= The Mass music and poems of Kazi Nazrul Islam have been widely used during the Indian Independence Movement and Bangladesh Liberation War. The music is highly motivational and revolutionary in nature with strong and powerful words and captivating tunes. It talks about the extremities of everything. The lyrics of those songs are provoking, as they talk against conservatism and about life on a broader parameter of philosophy and spirituality. The beauty of Nazrul's mass music lies in the freedom of its expression, which also drew immense criticism. However, those who understood its philosophy praised the courage and straightforwardness. Kazi Nazrul Islam playing flute in 1926, thumb =Ghazal= Nazrul's acquaintance with the tradition of Persian Ghazals, a form of love songs, was very significant in the sense that it paved the base of his successful efforts in composing Bengali Ghazals which he undertook by 1927‚Äì28. Bengali Ghazal is, it can be mentioned outright, an innovation by Kazi Nazrul Islam alone. It served as the first mass-level introduction of Islam into the mainstream tradition of Bengali music. Historical influence Nazrul used his music as a major way of disseminating his revolutionary notions, mainly by the use of strong words and powerful, but catchy, tunes. Among the revolutionary songs, Karar Oi Louho Kopat (Prison-doors of Steel) is best known and has been used in several movies, especially those made during the pre-independence period of Bangladesh.

The peninsula is separated from Kangaroo Island to the south by Investigator Strait. The most populous town in the region is Kadina. Overview Yorke Peninsula is the central, boot-shaped peninsula above the island and between the two inlets Prior to European settlement, which commenced around 1840, Yorke Peninsula was the home to the Narungga people. Today the descendants of these people still live on Yorke Peninsula, supported by the Narungga Aboriginal Progress Association in Maitland, and in the community at Point Pearce. Yorke Peninsula was named by Captain Matthew Flinders, R.N., after the Right Honourable Charles Philip Yorke (1764‚Äì1834) (later Lord Hardwicke), narrowly beating French navigator Captain Nicolas Baudin (who preferred the name 'Cambaceres Peninsula'). Principal towns include the Copper Coast towns of Kadina, Moonta and Wallaroo; farming centres of Maitland, Minlaton and Yorketown; and the port of Ardrossan. A number of smaller coastal towns are popular destinations for fishing and holidays, particularly for people from Adelaide. The south-western tip is occupied by Innes National Park.  Agriculture  Yorke Peninsula is a major producer of grain, particularly barley and the Peninsula's grain crops are worth more than $290 million annually. Historically this has been sent out by sea because there are no rail services. Most coastal towns on the peninsula have substantial jetties. In the past these were used by ketches, schooners, and later steamships, to collect the grain in bags, and deliver fertiliser and other supplies. As roads in the region improved, and freight-handling techniques changed from bags to bulk, this became obsolete. A deep-water port was opened in 1970 near the south-eastern tip at Port Giles to export grain in bulk, and almost all the other ports ceased to be used for freight in the 1950s and 1960s. The only other ports with bulk-handling facilities are Wallaroo at the north-western side, and Ardrossan at the top of Gulf St Vincent, also used to ship dolomite from a nearby mine for OneSteel. Maitland has a grain-receiving depot operated by AWB, serviced only by road. Wine production commenced on the Peninsula during the 1990s taking advantage of the rich grey, limestone-based soil. = Yorke Peninsula Field Days = Acknowledged as Australia's oldest Field Days, the Yorke Peninsula Field Days have been held since 1894. The Field Days site just outside Paskeville is a hive of agricultural activity every 2 years, at the end of September.Yorke Peninsula Field Days website, The Yorke Peninsula Field Days are acknowledged as the oldest in Australia with the first trial held near Bute, SA, on 31 July 1895. Physiography Aerial view of Yorke Peninsula, looking south from around Ardrossan. Gulf St Vincent is in the foreground, Spencer Gulf in the background. The \\"foot\\" of the \\"boot\\" can be discerned near the horizon The area is also known as the Yorke Horst, which is distinct physiographic section of the larger South Australian Shatter Belt province, which in turn is part of the larger West Australian Shield physiographic division. Along with Cape Eyre the peninsula is also part of the Eyre Yorke Block bioregion. Geography and Climate Most of Yorke Peninsula is prime agricultural land, with mostly small rolling hills and flat plains. The southern end of the Hummocks Range partially extends down the top of the Peninsula, flattening out near Clinton. The highest point [how high?] on the Peninsula is 5 km north-east of Maitland, although there is some debate as to where the Peninsula borders the Mid North, part of the steep Hummocks terrain may be considered part of the Peninsula. A series of shallow valleys line the interior of the Peninsula, with the main one called the Yorke Valley extending roughly from Sunnyvale, south of Paskeville through to Ramsey, between Minlaton and Stansbury. The predominant Yorke Valley area lies roughly in the area between Arthurton, Maitland, Ardrossan and Curramulka. Typical of the southern coastal areas of the state and influenced by the surrounding bodies of water, Yorke Peninsula has a Mediterranean climate, (Koppen: borderline Csa/Csb) with some areas bordering a Semi Arid Climate, with hot, dry summer and cool, wet winter seasons. Maximum temperatures in summer average around 30 degrees and in winter average around 12‚Äì15. Due to surrounding bodies of water, winter temperatures are moderated and milder than most of the state, with overnight temperatures rarely falling below 0, making frost relatively uncommon in the region but not unheard of. Northerly winds from the desert can bring temperatures well upwards of 40 degrees in summer and occasionally bring very warm winter days well into the 20s. Average precipitation is 4‚Äì600 mm, most of which falls from mid April through to September, though total and seasonal rainfall can vary greatly from year to year. Along with most of southern Australia, monsoonal lows from the north occasionally bring heavy storm events during spring and summer, rainfall is otherwise light and unreliable due to high pressure systems dominating the area. Transport As of 2015, a daily ferry service operates between Wallaroo and Lucky Bay, near Cowell on Eyre Peninsula.

Game components Initially, the game consisted of a timer and a plastic disc that displayed one word at a time. Later, stand-alone electronic devices with built-in random lists of word phrases were made available. Game play The game is played in two teams. The goal for each player is to get their team to say the word or word phrase displayed in the disc. One member of a team starts the timer and tries to get his or her team to guess the displayed word or phrase. A clue-giver can make any physical gesture, and can give almost any verbal clue, but may not say a word that rhymes with any of the words, give the first letter of a word, say the number of syllables, or say part of any word in the clue (e.g., \\"worry\\" for \\"worry wart\\"). When the team guesses correctly, the other team takes its turn. Play continues until the timer runs out. The team not holding the disc when time runs out scores a point. They also have one chance to guess the word or phrase, with team members allowed to confer; a correct answer earns a bonus point. The first team to score 7 points wins. Dispute Resolution: 1\\\\. If the timer runs out during the passing of the game unit before being fully in possession of the hands of the receiver, the passer is deemed still holding the unit. 2\\\\. A \\"tie\\" judgement is awarded in favor of the receiver 3\\\\. If the passer or receiver challenges a point, the oldest player in the game who is not the passer or receiver resolves the dispute. Original version The older version of the game contains discs with 72 words on each side. The word list is advanced by pressing a button on the right side of the disc apparatus. A timer beeps at an increasing rate before randomly buzzing, signalling the end of turn. A scoring sheet is provided. Electronic versions A later version, also known as Electronic Catch Phrase, is an electronic game (a device similar in appearance to the original version) with integrated phrase list, timer, and scoring. The game unit has a LCD screen to display the words and buttons to start the timer, advance play, and assign points to teams. Teams must guess the entire phrase as displayed. A second edition of the electronic game with a changed appearance has a backlit LCD screen and a visual score display rather than the auditory score system. Word list The electronic's version's word list contains 10,000 words, which are categorized: * \\"Everything\\" ‚Äì all 10,000 words in the game * \\"Tech/Inventions\\" ‚Äì Anything that has been invented through the ages, from ancient history to modern times * \\"History Buff\\" ‚Äì History, politics, wars, civics, and things in the present that will become history * \\"Entertainment\\" ‚Äì Movies, music, books, actors, singers, authors, as well as fun activities * \\"Sports/Games\\" ‚Äì Sports and games of all sorts, leisure activities * \\"Geography\\" ‚Äì Places, both geographically and answers to the question \\"where?\\"; Also things that are usually found in a particular place or region * \\"Transportation\\" ‚Äì Methods of transport, as well as things seen while travelling * \\"Around the House\\" ‚Äì Household items * \\"Food/Drink\\" ‚Äì Foods and drinks, cooking terms, ingredients, restaurants, other food items * \\"Plants/Animals\\" ‚Äì Plants, animals, items made from plants or animals * \\"Family\\" ‚Äì A subset of the words appropriate for children, no adult themes or terms Variations Advanced players and teams tend to forgo the game board. Instead, one person is assigned as the score keeper and tallies the points along the way. =Elimination Variation= A fast-paced and fun variation for large groups is to have multiple teams and play elimination style. Players split up into teams of two and are arranged in a circle, with teammates facing each other. * The team starting the round will pick a category and announce it to the group. Play starts as soon as the timer is started. The player must then get their teammate to correctly say the phrase by following the rules of normal play regarding clue-giving. * If a team guesses the phrase correctly, the device is passed to the player to the left as quickly as possible, without restarting the timer, and no point is scored. * If a team has the device when the buzzer sounds, the round is over and their team scores a point. * An answer that has started before but ends after the buzzer sounds (buzzer beaters) will count as long as it is correct. * If the buzzer sounds during a pass, neither team scores a point. A pass occurs from the time one team gets the phrase correct until the second team begins giving a clue. * When a team scores a certain number of points they are eliminated from play, and play continues until only one team is left. The number of points required to eliminate a team from play can vary depending on the size of the group. For instance, larger groups may find that the game moves faster if they play single elimination. Since teams are often passed the device with little time left they are forced to try to guess the phrase as quickly as possible as each point they earn moves them closer to elimination. This adds a frenetic pace to the game (especially when the timer starts ticking fast and you know you only have seconds left) and things can get exciting very quickly. To make things a little easier, each team may be allowed to skip one phrase per turn if they think it is too hard to describe in the time available. Each time the timer runs out, the team left holding the device can change the category if they so desire and must announce the new category to the group before starting the next round. The category cannot be changed once the timer has started. It is considered good sportsmanship for the passing team to skip to the next phrase before passing the device as quickly as possible to the next team, and to start giving clues as soon as possible after receiving the device. If a player waits an unreasonable amount of time (decided by the group as a whole each time an infraction occurs) before passing the device, or before beginning to give clues after receiving the device, that player's team will receive a point and the round ends. The game is similar to Taboo, also from Hasbro, in which a player tries to get his or her teammates to guess words without using the word in question or five related words.

ECCM is also known as electronic protective measures (EPM), chiefly in Europe. In practice, EPM often means resistance to jamming. History Ever since electronics have been used in battle in an attempt to gain superiority over the enemy, effort has been spent on techniques to reduce the effectiveness of those electronics. More recently, sensors and weapons are being modified to deal with this threat. One of the most common types of ECM is radar jamming or spoofing. This originated with the Royal Air Force's use of what they codenamed window during World War II, which is now often referred to as chaff. Jamming also may have originated with the British during World War II, when they began jamming German radio communications. In perhaps the first example of ECCM, the Germans increased their radio transmitter power in an attempt to 'burn through' or override the British jamming, which by necessity of the jammer being airborne or further away produced weaker signals. This is still one of the primary methods of ECCM today. For example, modern airborne jammers are able to identify incoming radar signals from other aircraft and send them back with random delays and other modifications in an attempt to confuse the opponent's radar set, making the 'blip' jump around wildly and be impossible to range. More powerful airborne radars means that it is possible to 'burn through' the jamming at much greater ranges by overpowering the jamming energy with the actual radar returns. The Germans were not really able to overcome the chaff spoofing very successfully and had to work around it (by guiding the aircraft to the target area and then having them visually acquire the targets). Today, more powerful electronics with smarter software for operation of the radar might be able to better discriminate between a moving target like an aircraft and an almost stationary target like a chaff bundle. With the technology going into modern sensors and seekers, it is inevitable that all successful systems have to have ECCM designed into them, lest they become useless on the battlefield. In fact, the 'electronic battlefield' is often used to refer to ECM, ECCM and ELINT activities, indicating that this has become a secondary battle in itself. Specific ECCM techniques The following are some examples of EPM (other than simply increasing the fidelity of sensors through techniques such as increasing power or improving discrimination): =ECM detection= Sensor logic may be programmed to be able to recognize attempts at spoofing (e.g., aircraft dropping chaff during terminal homing phase) and ignore them. Even more sophisticated applications of ECCM might be to recognize the type of ECM being used, and be able to cancel out the signal. =Pulse compression by \\"chirping\\", or linear frequency modulation= One of the effects of the pulse compression technique is boosting the apparent signal strength as perceived by the radar receiver. The outgoing radar pulses are chirped, that is, the frequency of the carrier is varied within the pulse, much like the sound of a cricket chirping. When the pulse reflects off a target and returns to the receiver, the signal is processed to add a delay as a function of the frequency. This has the effect of \\"stacking\\" the pulse so it seems stronger, but shorter in duration, to further processors. The effect can increase the received signal strength to above that of noise jamming. Similarly, jamming pulses (used in deception jamming) will not typically have the same chirp, so will not benefit from the increase in signal strength. =Frequency hopping= Frequency agility (\\"frequency hopping\\") may be used to rapidly switch the frequency of the transmitted energy, and receiving only that frequency during the receiving time window. This foils jammers which cannot detect this switch in frequency quickly enough or predict the next hop frequency, and switch their own jamming frequency accordingly during the receiving time window. The most advanced jamming techniques have a very wide and fast frequency range, and might possibly jam out an antijammer. This method is also useful against barrage jamming in that it forces the jammer to spread its jamming power across multiple frequencies in the jammed system's frequency range, reducing its power in the actual frequency used by the equipment at any one time. The use of spread-spectrum techniques allow signals to be spread over a wide enough spectrum to make jamming of such a wideband signal difficult. =Sidelobe blanking= Radar jamming can be effective from directions other than the direction the radar antenna is currently aimed. When jamming is strong enough, the radar receiver can detect it from a relatively low gain sidelobe. The radar, however, will process signals as if they were received in the main lobe. Therefore, jamming can be seen in directions other than where the jammer is located. To combat this, an omnidirectional antenna is used for a comparison signal. By comparing the signal strength as received by both the omnidirectional and the (directional) main antenna, signals can be identified that are not from the direction of interest. These signals are then ignored. =Polarization= Polarization can be used to filter out unwanted signals, such as jamming. If a jammer and receiver do not have the same polarization, the jamming signal will incur a loss that reduces its effectiveness. The four basic polarizations are linear horizontal, linear vertical, right-hand circular, and left-hand circular. The signal loss inherent in a cross polarized (transmitter different from receiver) pair is 3 dB for dissimilar types, and 17 dB for opposites. Aside from power loss to the jammer, radar receivers can also benefit from using two or more antennas of differing polarization and comparing the signals received on each. This effect can effectively eliminate all jamming of the wrong polarization, although enough jamming may still obscure the actual signal. =Radiation homing= Another practice of ECCM is to program sensors or seekers to detect attempts at ECM and possibly even to take advantage of them. For example, some modern fire-and-forget missiles like the Vympel R-77 and the AMRAAM are able to home in directly on sources of radar jamming if the jamming is too powerful to allow them to find and track the target normally. This mode, called \\"home-on- jam\\", actually makes the missile's job easier. Some missile seekers actually target the enemy's radiation sources, and are therefore called \\"anti-radiation missiles\\" (ARM). The jamming in this case effectively becomes a beacon announcing the presence and location of the transmitter. This makes the use of such ECM a difficult decision ‚Äì it may serve to obscure an exact location from a non-ARM missile, but in doing so it must put the jamming vehicle at risk of being targeted and hit by ARMs. See also * Jamming * Electronic warfare * Electronic warfare support measures * Wartime reserve mode  References  * Raytheon ECCM-capable radio set * Camp Evans Engineers develop World War II counter-measures with the help of Allen B.

It was founded by three German immigrants from Bavaria. John and Andrew Fuhrman started the Fuhrman Brothers meat market at 408 W. Harrison in Chicago in 1897 and invited brother-in-law George Forster to join them in 1898 creating Fuhrman Bros. and Forster Meat Markets. The name was soon changed to the Fuhrman and Forster Co. By 1902, they operated 5 meat markets in the Pilsen neighborhood area of Chicago. This neighborhood was largely populated by CzechoSlovakian and Bohemian immigrants who were very fond of Fuhrman and Forster products. Their lard was very popular with the women for baking. The company's horse-drawn delivery wagons were a common sight in the neighborhood as they delivered Fuhrman and Forster Co. products to many of the local butcher shops as well as their own stores. The horses were kept in stables behind one of the stores located at 1748 West 21st Place. By 1919, the wagons and horses were replaced by motor trucks which at one time numbered 75. The company was incorporated in 1920 and closed all retail outlets in 1923 to concentrate on pork packing and sausage manufacturing. By the 1940s the yellow and blue trucks were delivering product to customers on Chicago's west side and suburbs such as Berywn, Cicero and Riverside. Several different types of delivery trucks were used over the years with the most popular being manufactured by International and GMC. The company owned and operated their own fleet except for a few years in the late 1930s when the fleet was owned and operated by Hertz Corp. and leased back by the Fuhrman and Forster Co. The truck fleet was housed in a garage at 1647-1655 Blue Island Avenue, one block north of the main plant. There was a time when Fuhrman and Forster Company products were more popular on Chicago's south and west sides than ones from the Oscar Mayer Co. Like most companies, the Fuhrman and Forster Company fell on hard times during the Great Depression. It was particularly hard hit when the firm had to deal with the deaths of co-founders Andrew Fuhrman in 1930 and John Fuhrman in 1931. But sales were sufficient to keep the business going (everyone still had to eat) and with World War II came a temporary end to hard times. Gross sales approached $4.0 million a year. The company celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1947 and was featured in an article in the November 1st issue of the National Provisioner Magazine that year. However, depressed meat prices in the early 1950s proved too much to handle and the Fuhrman and Forster Company was closed in May 1955. An auction was held in September of that year to sell off the remaining assets with the funds distributed to the shareholders. \\"Select Brand\\" was the name under which many Fuhrman and Forster Co. products were marketed. They also manufactured house brands, the most popular was \\"Hilbran\\" marketed by the now closed Hillman's Grocery Stores in Chicago. At the time the Fuhrman and Forster Company was closed, Arthur Forster was President and Lawrence Forster was Secretary. Both were sons of co-founder George Forster. Herbert Krueger, son-in-law of co- founder John Fuhrman, was Treasurer. The main building at 1839-1855 Blue Island Ave. is gone now but the garage and a cold storage building at 1846 Loomis St. are still standing and in good condition. Part of the main building is still there at 1847 S. Blue Island.

He became well known for stints on DC Comics' Shade, the Changing Man and Neil Gaiman's two Death series. Chris has also illustrated several of Marvel Comics' X-Men-related series, including Generation X (which he co-created), X-Men Vol. 2, Uncanny X-Men, and Ultimate X-Men. Beginning in April, 2000 Chris illustrated his creator-owned series Steampunk. Biography =Early life= Artwork from Death: The Time of Your Life #1 (1993)Bachalo was born in Canada but was raised in Southern California. He has told interviewers that, as a child, he wanted to be a carpenter until he discovered he was allergic to dust. He attended the California State University at Long Beach, where he majored in graphic art and illustrated a few underground comics. =DC= After graduation, Bachalo sought work in the mainstream comic book industry. His first published assignment was The Sandman #12 (Jan. 1990), part of the \\"Doll's House\\" story arc, for DC Comics. Although before working on that issue, DC had already hired him as the regular artist for Shade, the Changing Man, an older property revived as an adult-oriented series by writer Peter Milligan. Bachalo's early work shows strong influence from Sam Kieth, Bill Sienkiewicz and Michael Golden. As his style developed, however, Bachalo's work became more idiosyncratic. His early 1990s style is minimalist with strong, thick lines, quirky characters and little concern for realism. Bachalo did not shy away from detailed landscapes but showed a rare penchant for pages with many small panels. In 1993, writer Neil Gaiman selected Bachalo for the Sandman miniseries Death: The High Cost of Living, starring the Sandman's older sister. At the time, Sandman was one of the most popular and acclaimed series in the industry and the miniseries helped boost Bachalo's visibility. The creative pair also reunited for Death: The Time of Your Life in 1996. After working at Marvel (below), Bachalo briefly returned to DC in 1999 for The Witching Hour mini-series with writer Jeph Loeb for Vertigo. =Marvel Comics= While at DC Comics, Bachalo illustrated the first issue of X-Men Unlimited, which Marvel published as an anthology X-Men comic book. Based on the success and fanfare from X-Men Unlimited #1, in 1994, Bachalo ended his stint on Shade and began working for Marvel Comics. He then illustrated the first three issues of Ghost Rider 2099, one of in a line of series reinventing popular Marvel characters in the year 2099. He also drew a cover for Runaways. However, he was soon assigned to create a new junior team of X-Men with Uncanny X-Men writer Scott Lobdell. The group Lobdell and Bachalo created, Generation X, was purposely bizarre and idiosyncratic because the two wanted to avoid the recent trend in superhero teams, where each team member represented a recognizable stock character. Generation X became a hit with the series' namesake due to Lobdell's realistically cynical and emotionally immature teen characters and Bachalo's atypical artwork. Bachalo illustrated the series through much of its first three years, taking a break in late 1995 and early 1996 to illustrate the second Death miniseries, Death: The Time of Your Life. During his time on Generation X, Bachalo's artwork underwent a change. Heavily influenced by Joe Madureira, Bachalo's characters became more cartoony and manga-like, with large eyes, heads and hands. He gravitated towards extremes in anatomy, drawing characters that were previously portrayed as bulky, short, or thin as even more so. In 1997, Bachalo left Generation X for Uncanny X-Men, arguably the comic book industry's most popular title, remaining until the end of 1998. =Steampunk= In 2000, Bachalo launched Steampunk, a comic book series inspired by the genre of fiction of the same name, which emulates early science fiction and in an alternate version of the early 1900s. The series is written by Joe Kelly and is part of Image Comics' imprint for creator-owned series, Cliffhanger. The series was criticized for Bachalo's overly detailed pencils, small panels and muddy dark coloring, which sometimes made it difficult to discern what was happening. Similarly, Joe Kelly's writing was not as straightforward as a mass audience typically preferred. Contrarily, the book's supporters praised it for those same reasons, as well as for the sheer imagination of the characters and story. The series, intended to be 25 issues, ended prematurely after the second story arc in issue #12. It is currently available in two reprinted trade paperbacks, Steampunk: Manimatron () and Steampunk: Drama Obscura (). When Richard Friend inks Chris Bachalo's pencils, the piece is signed \\"Chrisendo\\", a portmanteau of the names \\"Chris\\", \\"Friend\\", and \\"Bachalo\\". =Back with Marvel= In the early 2000s, Bachalo completed occasional work on various X-Men series, including Ultimate X-Men, Ultimate War, Grant Morrison's New X-Men (collected in New X-Men vol. 5: Assault on Weapon Plus) and the sequel to the Age of Apocalypse crossover. Bachalo was also the artist on Captain America for 6 issues (#21‚Äì26, running December 2003‚ÄìMay 2004 cover dates) pencilling a divisive run written by Robert Morales. In an attempt to humanize Steve Rogers, the pair managed to split fans' opinions fairly resoundingly, with both creators leaving the title ‚Äî Morales ten issues short of his intended contract for the series. From 2006 to 2008, Bachalo was the artist for the X-Men title along with new writer Mike Carey after completing his final story arc for Uncanny X-Men (#472‚Äì474). He was often filled-in for by artist Humberto Ramos, however. Bachalo has also pencilled (and coloured) a number of cards for the Vs. collectible card game. These have been renditions of both Marvel and DC characters. On top of his continuing work for Marvel, Bachalo finished issue #7 of Comicraft's Elephantmen, an issue 4 years in the making. The issue was done entirely in double-page spreads and marks his reunion with Steampunk writer Joe Kelly. The issue's story, \\"Captain Stoneheart and the Truth Fairy\\" also represents Bachalo's first work outside Marvel and DC since his fill-in issue of Witchblade. Bachalo has also been one of the four artists who was originally part of the Spider-Man Relaunch. Brand New Day, along with Phil Jimenez, Steve McNiven and Salvador Larroca. Starting with New Avengers #51, Bachalo provided variant covers for the creative team of Brian Michael Bendis and Billy Tan for the \\"Who will be the next Sorcerer Supreme?\\" storyline. From 2011-2012, he teamed up for multiple issues with Jason Aaron on his Wolverine and the X-Men. From 2013-2015 he returned to work with Bendis on Volume 3 of Uncanny X-Men. In 2016, he teamed up again with Jason Aaron on Dr. Strange's first solo title in 10 years, Way of the Weird. Antonio Fabela is a regular colorist of Bachalo's work.

The book became the inspiration for a genre of books known today as armchair treasure hunts. In March 1982 Williams received a letter and sketch from a man called Dugald Thomson, which he acknowledged as the first correct solution to the puzzle, meaning that Thomson had won the contest. It was later found that Thomson had not solved the puzzle and had guessed the hare's location using insider knowledge obtained from a former acquaintance of Williams. The revelation caused a minor scandal. Two British physics teachers were later acknowledged to be the first to have correctly solved the puzzle. Book In the 1970s, Williams was challenged by Tom Maschler, of the British publishing firm Jonathan Cape, to do \\"something no one has ever done before\\" with a picture book. Williams set out to create a book that readers would study carefully rather than flip through and then discard. The book's theme, a hunt for a valuable treasure, became his means to this end. Masquerade contains fifteen detailed paintings that illustrate the story of a hare named Jack Hare, who seeks to carry a treasure from the Moon (depicted as a woman) to the Sun (depicted as a man). On reaching the Sun, Jack finds that he has lost the treasure, and the reader is challenged to discover its location. Along with creating the book, Williams crafted 18-carat (75%) gold and jewels into a large filigree pendant in the shape of a hare. He sealed the hare inside a small ceramic casket, both to protect the prize from soil and to foil attempts to locate the treasure using a metal detector. The casket was inscribed with the legend \\"I am the keeper of the jewel of Masquerade, which lies waiting safe inside me for you or eternity\\". Kit Williams later said: > If I was to spend two years on the sixteen paintings for Masquerade I wanted > them to mean something. I recalled how, as a child, I had come across > \\"treasure hunts\\" in which the puzzles were not exciting nor the treasure > worth finding. So I decided to make a real treasure, of gold, bury it in the > ground and paint real puzzles to lead people to it. The key was to be > Catherine of Aragon's Cross at Ampthill, near Bedford, casting a shadow like > the pointer of a sundial. On 7 August 1979, Williams and celebrity witness Bamber Gascoigne secretly buried the hare's casket at Ampthill Park. Williams announced publicly that his forthcoming book contained all clues necessary to identify the treasure's precise location in Britain to \\"within a few inches.\\" At the time, the only additional clue he provided was that the hare was buried on public property that could be easily accessed. To ensure that readers from further afield had an equal chance of winning, Williams also announced that he would accept the first precisely correct answer sent to him by post. A modified version of the book appeared in Italian, with a treasure buried in Italy. The book was reinvented and translated by Joan Arnold and Lilli Denon with the name Il tesoro di Masquerade (Emme Edizioni). Search The book sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide, many in the United Kingdom, but some also in Australia, South Africa, West Germany, Japan (where the book was called ‰ªÆÈù¢ËàûË∏è‰ºö kamenbutoukai, meaning a masquerade ball or masked ball), France and the United States. Searchers often dug up public and private property, acting on hunches. One location in England named \\"Haresfield Beacon\\" was a popular site for searchers, and Williams paid the cost of a sign notifying searchers that the hare was not hidden nearby. Real-life locations reproduced in the paintings were searched by treasure hunters, including Sudbury Hall in Derbyshire and Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. In March 1982, Williams received a letter containing a sketch which he recognised as the first correct solution sent to him. Williams telephoned the sender, a man calling himself \\"Ken Thomas\\". Williams instructed him to dig for the hare. He realised that Thomas had not solved the puzzle in the intended manner, and it seemed that he had made a lucky guess. Soon after Thomas was formally awarded the prize, Williams received a correct solution to the puzzle, sent by physics teachers Mike Barker of William Hulme's Grammar School and John Rousseau of Rossall School. Barker and Rousseau seemed to have unearthed the prize themselves when digging at Ampthill, but had not noticed it inside its clay box; it appeared that Thomas had discovered it in the dirt piles they had left behind. Bamber Gascoigne, having been asked by Williams to witness the burial of the hare and to document the contest from beginning to end, wrote the book Quest for the Golden Hare. He summarised his experiences thus: > Tens of thousands of letters from Masqueraders have convinced me that the > human mind has an equal capacity for pattern-matching and self-deception. > While some addicts were busy cooking the riddle, others were more single- > mindedly continuing their own pursuit of the hare quite regardless of the > news that it had been found. Their own theories had come to seem so > convincing that no exterior evidence could refute them. These most > determined of Masqueraders may grudgingly have accepted that a hare of some > sort was dug up at Ampthill, but they believed there would be another hare, > or a better solution, awaiting them at their favourite spot. Kit would > expect them to continue undismayed by the much publicised diversion at > Ampthill and would be looking forward to the day when he would greet them as > the real discoverers of the real puzzle of Masquerade. Optimistic > expeditions were still setting out, with shovels and maps, throughout the > summer of 1982. Solution \\"Isaac Newton\\" painting. Newton's eyes and digits, and those of the mouse in his sleeve, point to letters of the word \\"H-O-U-R\\". Newton's rings and puppets also give the sequence for digits and animals throughout the book. Masquerade's puzzle is elaborate. The answer is hidden in the 15 painted illustrations. In each painting, a line must be drawn from each depicted creature's left eye through the longest digit on its left hand, and out to one of the letters in the page border. Then from the left eye through the longest digit on the left foot; the right eye through the longest digit on the right hand; and finally the right eye through the longest digit on the right foot. This is only done for eyes and digits that are visible in the painting. The letters indicated by these lines can be made to form words, either by treating them as anagrams or by applying the sequence of animals and digits suggested by the Isaac Newton painting (pictured). Following this method reveals fifteen words or short phrases, which together form a nineteen-word message: > CATHERINE'S LONG FINGER OVER SHADOWS EARTH BURIED YELLOW AMULET MIDDAY > POINTS THE HOUR IN LIGHT OF EQUINOX LOOK YOU The acrostic of these words and phrases reads \\"CLOSEBYAMPTHILL\\". Properly interpreted, the message tells the reader that the treasure is buried near the cross-shaped monument to Catherine of Aragon in Ampthill Park, at the precise spot touched by the tip of the monument's shadow at noon on the day of either the March or September equinox. Many additional hints and \\"confirmers\\" are scattered throughout the book. For example, in the painting depicting the Sun and the Moon dancing around the Earth, the hands of the two figures are clasped together, pointing at the date of the spring equinox. =Sunday Times clue= On December 21, 1980 the Sunday Times published an additional clue created by Kit Williams to the puzzle. This drawing needed to be cut out, folded in half and then with a light shone through a message could be read in a mirror. The message read \\"To do my work, I appointed four men from twenty, the tallest and the fattest, and the righteous follow the sinister.\\" The \\"...four men from twenty\\" refers to four fingers and toes out of twenty digits; \\"...the tallest and the fattest\\" relates to using the longest digits; \\"..the righteous follow the sinister\\" provides a clue to the decoding of the letter order (left (sinister) eyes through left finger and toe first, then the righteous (right) ones). The clue featured a self portrait of Kit Williams surrounded by fourteen animals, the first letter of each making \\"Merry Christmas\\". Scandal On 11 December 1988, The Sunday Times printed a story accusing the winner of the Masquerade contest of being a fraud. \\"Ken Thomas\\" was revealed as a pseudonym of a man called Dugald Thompson. Thomson's business partner, John Guard, was the boyfriend of Veronica Robertson, who had previously been a girlfriend of Kit Williams. Guard allegedly convinced Robertson to help him win the contest because they were both animal rights activists and he promised to donate any profits to the animal rights cause. The Sunday Times alleged that while living with Williams, Robertson had learned the approximate physical location of the hare, while remaining ignorant of the proper solution to the book's main puzzle. After supposedly finding out from Robertson that the hare was in Ampthill, Guard and two associates were said to have started searching for it using metal detectors. After searching for some time with no success, they drew a crude sketch of the location, which Thompson then submitted to Williams under the name \\"Ken Thomas\\", and it was this that Williams acknowledged as the first correct answer. Reacting to the revelations, Williams said: \\"This tarnishes Masquerade and I'm shocked by what has emerged. I feel a deep sense of responsibility to all those many people who were genuinely looking for it. Although I didn't know it, it was a skeleton in my cupboard and I'm relieved it has come out.\\" Legacy Dugald Thompson founded a software company called Haresoft, and offered the jewel as a prize to a new contest which took the form of a computer game, Hareraiser. The company and its game (which many believe to be unsolvable with only meaningless text and graphics), were unsuccessful, yielding no winner. When the company went into liquidation in 1988, the hare was sold at Sotheby's London on behalf of the liquidators, Peat Marwick, in December 1988. The hare sold for ¬£31,900 to an anonymous buyer. Williams himself went there to bid, but dropped out at ¬£6,000. The treasure's whereabouts remained unknown for over 20 years, until it came to light in 2009. The BBC Radio 4 programme The Grand Masquerade, broadcast 14 July 2009, told the story of the creation and solution of the puzzle. Williams was interviewed and presenter John O'Farrell claimed that this was the first time Williams had talked about the scandal for 20 years. During the interview Williams expressed the desire to see the hare again. Hearing this, the granddaughter of its then current owner‚Äîan anonymous purchaser \\"based in the Far East\\"‚Äîarranged for Williams to be reunited briefly with his work. This was featured in a television documentary, The Man Behind the Masquerade, which aired on BBC Four on 2 December 2009. The hare was on display at the V&A; Museum, London, as part of its \\"British Design 1948‚Äì2012\\" retrospective in 2012. Masquerade became the forerunner of an entire genre of cryptic puzzles known as armchair treasure hunts. It spawned a succession of books and games from other publishers seeking to emulate its success, including The Key To The Kingdom (Pavilion Books, 1982), The Piper Of Dreams (Hodder & Stoughton, 1982), The Secret (Bantam Books, 1982), The Golden Key (William Maclellan, 1982), Treasure: In Search of the Golden Horse (Intravision, 1984), The Merlin Mystery (Warner Books, 1998) and the French On the Trail of the Golden Owl (Manya, 1993), which is still unsolved. Forrest Fenn took this idea to the Rocky Mountains and dared to conquer the \\"armchair\\" genre with his treasure hunt The Thrill of the Chase: a Memoir (One Horse Land & Cattle Co., 2010). Kit Williams himself also created a second treasure-hunt book, The Bee on the Comb (1984). Similar hunts have continued being published in various formats. Alkemstone (Level-10, 1981), a computer game developed during the height of the Masquerade hype, is still unsolved. Many later hunts make use of technologies that were unavailable when Masquerade was published, such as the web-based homage Menagerie, the CD-ROM based Treasure Quest, and Text4Treasure, which uses SMS messaging. Others, such as Army Of Zero and West By Sea: A Treasure Hunt that Spans the Globe (Expeditionaire, 2016) follow Masquerade's use of physical media for the main puzzles, but provide additional clues online.

The weapon had a nominal yield of approximately 3 megatons. It was scaled down to 1.6 megatons for the live test.https://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/22-november-1955-rds-37  Leading to the RDS-37  The RDS-37 was a reaction to the efforts of the United States. Previously, the Soviet Union used many of their spies in the U.S. to help them generate methods and ideas for the nuclear bomb. The creation of the hydrogen bomb required less usage of this method, although they still received help from some spies, most importantly, Klaus Fuchs. In 1945, the Soviet Union reached a decision to work on a design for a \\"super bomb\\". Also in 1945, Enrico Fermi gave lectures at Los Alamos discussing the fusion process. At the end of his lecture he stated \\"so far all schemes for the initiation of the super [are] rather vague\\". In the spring of 1946, Edward Teller set up a conference to assess all the information known about the hydrogen bomb. Klaus Fuchs attended this same conference. In the same year, Teller postulated a new design for the hydrogen bomb, which he called the \\"Alarm Clock\\", which he suggested would use lithium-6 deuteride instead of pure deuterium. Klaus Fuchs had passed on information about both the nuclear bomb and the hydrogen bomb to the Soviet Union. This information resulted in the recruitment of Igor Tamm‚Äôs group, whose work helped create the hydrogen bomb. The content that Fuchs provided in 1948 was not only related to the hydrogen bomb, but also the nuclear industry as a whole. It provided detailed insight into the bomb design using a two-stage igniting block. The designs were quickly sent to Lavrentiy Beria, who had been placed in charge of the Russian bomb program by Joseph Stalin and forwarded to Igor Kurchatov, Boris Vannikov and Yulii Khariton, to validate and assess these designs. On May 5, 1948, Vannikov and Kurchatov wrote a reply, stating: > As regards the material No. 713a, the basic ideas about the role of tritium > in the transfer of explosion from a uranium-235 primer to deuterium, about > the necessity of careful selection of uranium primer power, and about the > role of particles and photons in the transfer of the explosion to deuterium > are new. These materials are valuable in that they will be helpful to Cde. > Zel‚Äôdovich in his work on the superbomb, performed under the operations > plans approved by the First Main Directorate. More effort should be put into > research in that area, and a start should be made on the work on the > practical design. Vannikov set out to study deuterium and its effects. Khariton also sent his reply on 5 May 1948, which urged the Soviet Union to set up a design group. At that time, very few people knew anything about hydrogen bomb design. The scientists in the United States also did not fully understand their own designs. The Soviet Union set up a group to work on the hydrogen bomb. In August 1948, Andrei Sakharov postulated the sloyka, or layer cake method, which consisted of alternating layers of uranium and thermonuclear fuel. In early 1949, this layer-cake design was tweaked, with lithium-6 deuteride as the thermonuclear fuel. In early 1950, Klaus Fuchs was arrested in the United Kingdom, and was unable to continue his espionage activity for the Soviet Union. The Soviet scientists had the idea to increase the deuterium density. Sakharov and his team saw the possibility of detonating a smaller nuclear bomb within the layer cake. This idea was successful, and the first implementation was used on the RDS-6s. The RDS-6s paved the way for the RDS-37. By 1952, the Soviet Union began to fully consider the two-stage bomb. However, in 1954, the plan was finally realized. Prior to 1954, the thermonuclear device was not thought to be initiated by radiation, but by a shock wave. On 1 November 1952, the United States tested their first \\"hydrogen bomb\\", codenamed Ivy Mike. The design was based on the Teller‚ÄìUlam layout. Ivy Mike was not a usable weapon. It was massive in size, weighing 82 tons. On 12 August 1953, the Soviets had tested their own \\"hydrogen bomb\\" in a test code named \\"Joe 4\\", which was based on the layer-cake design. By this time no one had created a \\"true\\" hydrogen bomb. All other tests had a kiloton yield. In the spring of 1954, the US tested a series of six nuclear devices, known as Operation Castle, with each experiment being in the megaton range. The first of these was Castle Bravo, which eventually turned out as the largest initiation by the United States ever. By spring of 1954, the Soviet scientists began to understand the possibility of releasing radiation from the nuclear-bomb trigger and using it to initiate the fusion part of the bomb. This idea parallels the Teller‚ÄìUlam design used in the Mike initiation. They subsequently abandoned the single- stage layer-cake and tube designs, and focused entirely on the two-stage bomb project. A report on the activity of the theoretical sector No. 1 published in 1954 states: > Atomic compression is being investigated theoretically in collaboration with > members of sector No. 2. The main problems associated with atomic > compression are in the developmental stage. Emission of radiation from the > atomic bomb used to compress the main body. Calculations show that for > radiation is emitted very strongly. Conversion of radiant energy into > mechanical energy to compress the main body. These principles have been > developed through the efforts of Sectors No. 2. and No. 1. On 22 November 1955, the Russians tested their first true two-stage hydrogen bomb in the megaton range, the RDS-37. This test implemented the two-stage radiation implosion. This was also the world's first air-dropped fusion-bomb test.  Foundations of RDS-37  After the Bravo Test in March 1954, Soviet scientists started to search for ways to make an effective large-yield thermonuclear bomb. After a lot of intensive research of past experience with these bombs, a new two-stage bomb was devised. The RDS-37's thermonuclear charges are founded in fundamental scientific concepts of high-energy-density physics. The principle of radiation implosion assumes three concepts. According to Ilkaev, they are: \\"the predominant proportion of the energy of the explosion of the nuclear charge (the primary module) is generated in the form of X-ray radiation; the energy of the X-ray radiation is transported to the fusion module; the implosion of the fusion module using the energy of the 'delivered' X-ray radiation\\". Hopes for a better compression of nuclear material that could be initiated had been in discussion since the early 1950s. Not long after, Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Andrei Sakharov started to work on this theory. \\"In January 1954, Ya. B. Zeldovich and A. D. Sakharov considered in detail a device layout which incorporated the principle of a two-stage nuclear charge\\". Many people questioned whether they could be successful from the very beginning. Questions concerning the two-stage nuclear charge fell into two categories. The first set of questions concerned nuclear implosion. The first module, or fission trigger, initiated \\"by compression of nuclear material or fission and fusion of materials by spherical explosion of chemical explosives, in which the spherical symmetry of the implosion was dictated by the initial spherically symmetric detonation of the explosive\\". There seemed to be no way in which \\"a heterogeneous structure composed of a primary source (or sources) and a compressible secondary module\\" could \\"maintain the spherically symmetric 'nuclear implosion\\". The following is a report by Sakharov and Romanov on 6 August, with the title \\"Atomic Compression\\". \\"Atomic Compression is being investigated theoretically in collaboration with members of sector No. 2. The main problems associated with atomic compression are in the development stage. (1) Emission of radiation from the atomic bomb used to compress main body. Calculations show that for [deleted] radiation is emitted very strongly... (2) Conversion of radiant energy into mechanical energy to compress the main body. It is postulated [deleted]. These principles have been developed through the team efforts of Sectors No. 2 and No. 1 (Ya. B. Zel‚Äôdovich, Yu. A. Trutnev, and A. D. Sakharov)...\\". This problem with a two-stage nuclear charge brings about two other problems. One, \\"what is now the carrier of the explosive energy of the original source?\\". Two, \\"how is this energy transported to the secondary module?\\". The second set of questions concerns the secondary module impacted by the nuclear implosion of the fission trigger. At first, scientist thought that the energy of a nuclear initiation of the fission trigger in a two-stage charge would be transported by the flow of the products of the initiation as the shock wave spread through the heterogeneous structure of the secondary module. Zeldovich and Sakharov \\"decided to choose an analog of the inner element of the RDS-6s charge for the basic physical element of the secondary module, i.e. the 'layered' spherical configuration of the system\\".  Factors behind the design  The Soviet Union was able to form some similar achievements to the United States without the help of outside information. \\"The active material, instead of being a solid sphere to begin with, as in the Nagasaki bomb, would be fabricated as a shell, with a 'levitated' sphere in its center. Part of the expensive plutonium was replaced with less expensive uranium-235. Levitation increased the energy yield and made it possible to reduce the size and weight of the explosive. Similar achievements were achieved without espionage by the Soviet Laboratories.\\" The initial alarm- clock method derived by Teller was assessed by Stanislaw Ulam, who decided that it would be more difficult and costlier than expected. During this time the United States were focused on the Alarm Clock, while the Soviet Union were focusing on the Sloyka method. The alarm-clock dilemma lasted until 1951, when Ulam came up with the idea of compressing a thermonuclear secondary with the hydrodynamic shock produced by a primary fission bomb. Teller agreed with this method and even altered it by using the pressure from the radiation from the primary, rather than hydrodynamic shock. After Teller had finally accepted this method, the question remained. Which thermonuclear fuel would be involved. The three main choices were lithium deuteride, deuterated ammonia and liquid deuterium. \\"Each had its advantages and disadvantages, lithium deuteride would be the simplest material to engineer because it was solid at room temperature, but breeding tritium within the bomb from lithium required a complex chain of thermonuclear reactions that involved only one of lithium‚Äôs several isotopes.\\" Deuterated ammonia could be kept in the liquid phase with moderate cooling or under mild pressure, but its physical properties were not well known at that point. The problem with liquid deuterium was the technology to transfer and store it in bulk quantities was not yet developed. The United States decided to choose liquid deuterium as their thermonuclear fuel. This was the premise behind the Ivy Mike bomb. The initiation of Ivy Mike by the United States prompted Soviet retaliation, and the Soviets quickly attempted to catch up. Although the Soviet Union had initiated their RDS-6 around that same time, the RDS-6 was initiated by high-powered explosives, while Ivy Mike was initiated by radiation method. The Soviets then abandoned their layered- cake method and focused on a two-stage bomb method. The hydrogen bomb primarily has 2 units: a nuclear bomb, which was the primary unit, and a secondary energy unit. The first stage of the hydrogen bomb resembled the layer-cake design, except the main difference is that the initiation is carried out by a nuclear device, rather than a conventional explosive. This design was initially postulated by Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller in 1941. Teller insisted that they should ignite deuterium by some fission weapon. The hydrogen bomb was a challenge, and would be more powerful and destructive than the nuclear bomb. The fusion cell itself was not very powerful, coming out to about 17.6 MeV per reaction, but the quantity of hydrogen fuel can be scaled up to make the weapon as large as desired.  Design process  Andrei Sakharov served as the leading theoretical contributor to the RDS-37 project, as he was the first to quantify the theoretical gains that could be had from a thermonuclear fuel. Sakharov developed his own compression method completely independent of the Teller-Ulam design. Sakharov's design for atomic compression utilized several tightly packed layers of either deuterium- deuterium or deuterium-tritium that would initiate inwardly, achieving an atomic compression. In theory, an atomic initiatitor would be positioned in the center of a spherical housing that was surrounded by layers of thermonuclear fuel and uranium. The entire system was to be compressed by an explosive placed all around the outside of the multi-layer sphere and initiate an implosion and ultimate initiation of the atomic initiatitor. The efficiency of this design earned Sakharov some prestige among his co-workers at Design Bureau 11. This design was referred to as the \\"Sloika\\" by Sakharov's co- workers as it resembled a traditional Russian, multi-layered cake that was tightly held together by a thick cream. The main problem with his idea was that the reaction cross sections of deuterium-deuterium and deuterium-tritium reactions were not known, and only theorized about. Design Bureau 11 (KB-11) presented the idea for the RDS-6 bomb design to USSR officials using primarily theoretical calculations. Andrei Sakharov published a paper in January 1949 where he noted that the deuterium ‚Äì tritium and deuterium ‚Äì deuterium reaction cross sections had not been studied experimentally and all assessments were conjectural. In March 1949 Khariton requested to Beria that Tamm and Kompaneets be given access to the intelligence data with the D‚ÄìT cross- sections. This was refused to minimize the access to intelligence materials but instead on 27 April D‚ÄìT cross-section measurements were sent to Tamm and Kompaneets without mentioning the origin. Ironically similar data was published in the Physical Review issue of 15 April 1949. With this information, Sakharov and Design Bureau 11 successfully implemented atomic compression in the RDS-6 tests. On 24 December 1954, the decision for implementation of the idea of atomic compression was green-lit by Soviet officials in a new project code named RDS-37. Test site preparations and other important test operations entered the preparation phase at the start of 1955. For RDS-37, a new design problem made itself known, keeping the distribution of charge from the spherical implosion symmetric. This led to the development of a canonical system in which both the primary and secondary modules were placed into the same compartment to maximize the directional scattering of X-rays. The vast amounts of energy from the initial atomic initiation were transferred in the form of X-rays, which were directed in such a way that they would provide all the required energy to initiate the thermonuclear charge. The technical specifications for the bomb design were completed by 3 February 1955 but were continuously reevaluated and improved up until RDS-37 was delivered to the test site in Semipalatinsk. It was during this time that KB-11 found that they could use lithium‚Äìdeuterium as a thermonuclear fuel to replace the deuterium‚Äìtritium fuel that was decided upon after publication of the Teller‚ÄìUlam tests. Several factors had to be overcome by Design Bureau 11 in implementing the idea of atomic compression. The main problems dealt with the massive amounts of radiation that would be emitted from the initial atomic bomb implosion. The calculated yields were large enough that there was much concern whether or not a structure could be engineered to house and hold the energy emission. The next big obstacle to overcome dealt with converting the vast amounts of radiant energy into mechanical energy that would be used to compress the main body. In a report written by Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Andrei Sakharov, it was stated that the new principle of atomic compression as seen in the RDS-37 was a \\"shining example of creative teamwork\\". The report went on further to boast enormous amounts of design-oriented, experimental, and technological efforts carried out under the supervision of Design Bureau 11's chief designer, Yulii Borisovich Khariton. The RDS-37 was assembled as an air-deliverable bomb and during testing, was dropped from an aircraft. In its initial testing phase, the bomb's energy yield was reduced out of a safety concern. The lithium deuteride fusion cell was modified to replace some fusion fuel with a passive material.  Initiation aftermath  RDS-37 was initiated at the Semipalatinsk test site on 22 November 1955. Despite this reduction in yield, much of its shock wave was focused back downward at the ground unexpectedly because the weapon initiated under an inversion layer, causing a trench to collapse on a group of soldiers, killing one. It also caused a building in Kurchatov, away, to collapse and kill a young girl. A group of forty two individuals in Kurchatov were also recorded as having been injured from glass fragments caused by the initiation. A scientist in Andre Sakharov's theoretical lab recalled the initiation in a collective book of memoirs. He witnessed the RDS-37 test from a viewing station away from the center of the initiation. As the countdown reached zero, the first impression he had \\"was of almost intolerable heat, as if [his head] had been placed into an open oven for several seconds.\\" The shock wave of dust and debris caused by the explosion could be seen and heard approaching and reached the viewing station roughly ninety seconds after the initiation of the thermonuclear unit. All viewers were forced to fall down on their faces with their feet pointed toward the explosion to help avoid injury from flying debris. After the shock wave passed, all the viewers stood up and started cheering their success, the Soviet Union became the first to successfully air deliver a two-stage thermonuclear weapon. The measured energy yield of the initiation was equivalent to that of 1.6 megatons of TNT. After the testing of the RDS-37, the commission noted three things during the meeting on 24 November 1955, \\"the design of the hydrogen bomb, based on a novel principle, has been successfully tested; it is necessary to continue detailed studies of the processes proceeding in explosions of bombs of this type; further development of hydrogen bombs should be conducted on the basis of a broad application of the principles chosen as the foundation of the RDS-37 bomb\\". The successful testing of the RDS-37 made it possible to start large-scale development of thermonuclear weapons. The charge of the RDS-37 became the prototype for all of the following two-stage thermonuclear devices in the USSR.  Delivery method  The weapon was air-dropped at Semipalatinsk Test Site, Kazakhstan, making it the first air-dropped two-stage thermonuclear test. It would become the largest initiation realized at the Semipaltinsk test site. The RDS-6s device (Joe-4) initiation in 1953 had one-stage design, and was not scalable into the megaton yield range. The RDS-37 was dropped from a Tupolev Tu-16 bomber and was used most through the late 1950s and 1960s. After a while the Soviet Union felt as if the 2.9-megaton thermonuclear bomb was excessive for some missions, so the less powerful RP-30 and RP-32 200-kiloton bombs were ready for some missions. It would take the United States until 20 May 1956, about half a year, to achieve the same results through the Cherokee nuclear weapons test.  Important factors from RDS-37  The RDS-37 tests at the Semipalatink Site proved to bring the Soviet Union back into the arms race with the United States. A large part of this was due to the fact that the Soviet Union was the first nation to successfully employ the use of lithium deuterium as a thermonuclear fuel. Another important factor to consider was the accuracy with which the Soviets were able to predict the energy yields of their bombs. The predictions for the RDS-6 tests were accurate up to 30% and the RDS-37 tests were accurate to within 10%, whereas the American counterpart energy yield predictions were off by a factor of two and a half in the Castle Bravo test. The Soviets also delivered a weapon-ready design for the RDS-37. On the American side of the arms race, the bombs being tested were remotely detonated. \\"The test was the culmination of many years of labor, a triumph that has opened the way to the development of a whole range of devices with diverse high-performance characteristics.\\" The report on the RDS-37, written by Zel'dovich and Sakharov, stated that the new principle of atomic compression as seen in the RDS-37 was a \\"shining example of creative teamwork.\\" The report boasted enormous amounts of design-oriented, experimental and technological efforts carried out under the supervision of Design Bureau 11's chief designer, Khariton. The successful initiation of the first two-stage thermonuclear weapon was a monumental moment in the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons program and helped shape the path of the program. It had shown that the gap between the United States and the Soviet Union was closing. More importantly, the nuclear yield gap had been closed. It was now a race between the nations to perfect the bomb, making it lighter, reliable, and more compact. Now, 22 November 1955, marked the date were the Soviet Union possessed a weapon that could destroy any target in the United States. The thermonuclear weapons race between the United States and the Soviet Union exceeded all expectations set out before the scientists who took part. Two countries creating thermonuclear weapons with such energy yields from two different design methods proved to be the crowning achievement for science in the 1950s. Of course, the successful and promising work from both the United States and the Soviet Union only spurred each country to push for stronger weapons, as the floodgates of thermonuclear weapon potential had been opened. This was, of course, entirely the norm at the time considering that the Cold War was in full swing. It was a significant boost to Soviet morale knowing that the Soviet Union's physicists, engineers, scientist, and great minds were able to not only compete with the Americans, but also able to outperform them in some key areas of weapon and technological development. The RDS program gave rise to the genius of Andrei Sakharov, who undoubtedly was the driving force behind the Soviet thermonuclear weapons development program. During his time at Design Bureau 11, Sakharov formulated the most critical ideas for the advancement of Soviet thermonuclear projects. RDS-37 gave Sakharov a lot of credibility and prestige among his co-workers and superiors. Following his success, he was given more autonomy in his research and made significant contributions in the realm of nuclear weaponry (and industry). His studies and theories on magnetic plasma confinement and on the magnetic thermonuclear reactor eventually led to the introduction of large electromagnetic pulse devices and laser fusion. Many of Sakharov's works and proposed ideas during his time working on the RDS projects are still on going today. Video of the RDS-37 are often confused with video of the Tsar Bomba, although they can be quite similar. RDS-37 video have the initiation moved to the center, and Tsar Bomba video have the initiation moved to the right (except for the mushroom- cloud video, which is in the center). In addition, the RDS-37 test occurred in the Semipalatinsk test area, and some of the video looks across the roofs of the secret city of Kurchatov, aka Semipalatinsk-16. The Tsar occurred over the southern half of the Arctic polar desert island of Novaya Zemlya, with no similar population centers within hundreds of kilometers at that time.

In 1271, the brothers divided their heritage and Albert became sole ruler of the Gorizia estates until his death. His descendants, known collectively as the Albertine line, ruled the County of Gorizia until the extinction of the House in 1500. Coat-of-arms of the count of Gorizia. Biography Albert was the younger son of Count Meinhard III of Gorizia, who had married Adelaide, daughter of Count Albert IV of Tyrol. As his father-in-law left no male heirs when he died in 1253, Count Meinhard III was able to unite the Gorizia and Tyrolean lands under his rule. Reigning as Meinhard I of Gorizia-Tyrol, Albert's father, however, also had entered a fierce quarrel with the Sponheim duke Bernhard of Carinthia and his son, Archbishop-elect Philip of Salzburg. Defeated by the united Carinthian and Salzburg forces, Meinhard's sons, young Albert and his elder brother Meinhard IV, from 1253 were held hostage by the Salzburg archbishop at Hohenwerfen Castle. Count Meinhard died in 1258; his sons, finally released in 1262, went on to rule their Gorizia-Tyrol heritage. In 1267 Albert participated in an expedition against the advancing Venice forces in the March of Istria alongside the Aquileia patriarch Gregorio di Montelongo, but later had him kidnapped sparking a long-time conflict. In 1271, after a lengthy inheritance dispute, Albert finally split his father's heirloom of Gorizia-Tyrol with his elder brother Meinhard. He received the County of Gorizia, i.e. the family's estates around Gorizia in the former March of Friuli, in Istria and Carniola, as well as in the Tyrolean Puster Valley up to Lienz, while Meinhard went on to rule as Count of Tyrol. While the Tyrolean branch of the Meinhardiner dynasty became extinct in the male line upon the death of Meinhard's son Henry in 1335, Albert's descendants ruled Gorizia until the death of Count Leonhard in 1500. In the war for Capodistria (1274-1279), Albert again sided for Patriarch Raimondo della Torre against Venice, receiving the fortress of Cormons in exchange. When in 1275 the armed conflict of King Ottokar II of Bohemia against the newly elected Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany broke out, Albert invaded Ottokar's lands in Carniola and the Windic March, while his brother Meinhard occupied Carinthia; later they both invaded the Duchy of Styria (1276). The conflict ended with confiscation of Ottokar's possessions by King Rudolf, although the war later resumed, ending with the death of Ottokar in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. In reward of their support, Albert's brother Meinhard was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Carinthia in 1286. In 1283 Albert and Patriarch Raimondo were again allied against Venice, this time in the war for Trieste; however, in 1289, after an unsuccessful attack against the Romagna fort in April 1289, he signed a separate peace with the Venetians. Marriage and issue Albert married Euphemia, daughter of the Piast duke Konrad I of G≈Çog√≥w and after her death in 1275 Countess Euphemia of Ortenburg. He had two sons: Henry III, born 1263, who succeeded him as Count of Gorizia from 1304 to 1323; and Albert II, Count of Gorizia from 1323 to 1325.

The undulating track is noted for its fast, sweeping bends. Opened in 1972, Dijon-Prenois hosted the Formula One French Grand Prix five times, and the Swiss Grand Prix in 1982. The non-championship 1975 Swiss Grand Prix was also held at Dijon. The circuit currently hosts the Grand Prix de l'Age d'Or, and last hosted the FFSA GT Championship in 2012. Part of the added section of Dijon-Prenois with the Parabolique corner History Planned in 1967, work commenced in December 1969. The track was part of a plan to make Dijon an automotive centre. It was the brainchild of rugby-player and wrestler Fran√ßois Chambelland (sometimes assumed to be the masked wrestler l'Ange Blanc), and was developed with the aid of racers Jean-Pierre Beltoise and Fran√ßois Cevert, as well as motoring journalist .Furet, p. 13 In spite of lack of support from the city government and a chronic lack of funds, the track was declared open on 26 May 1972, with Guy Ligier making the first timed lap around the circuit. The first race, for 2-litre prototypes, was held ten days later. Arturo Merzario was the inaugural winner. The first F1 race was run in 1974 on the circuit's original layout; with the fastest lap times under the one-minute mark, there was a major problem with congested traffic between the race leaders and the back-markers. Therefore, in 1976 an extension was added to lengthen the circuit as well as to reprofile many of its corners before the time F1 could return to Dijon in 1977. The 1979 French Grand Prix featured a memorable battle for second place in the final laps between Gilles Villeneuve's Ferrari and Ren√© Arnoux's Renault, which was finally won by Villeneuve. The race itself was won by Jean-Pierre Jabouille in the other Renault - Renault's first, and the first F1 victory for a turbocharged car. The 1982 Formula One season was not to see the French Grand Prix held at Dijon as that race was held at the Paul Ricard Circuit, located at Le Castellet in southern France. Instead, Dijon held the (as yet) last Swiss Grand Prix, despite being located in France and not Switzerland. This was due to the Swiss Government's ban on motor racing in the wake of the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans disaster in which 83 people, many of whom were spectators, and the driver Pierre Levegh, died when a car crashed at high speed and vaulted into the pit straight grandstand. 1982 Formula One World Champion Keke Rosberg, driving his Williams-Ford, won his first ever Grand Prix in the 1982 Swiss race, four seconds in front of local favourite Alain Prost driving a factory backed Renault. The French Grand Prix alternated between Paul Ricard and Dijon, until the last F1 race at Dijon took place in 1984. The race was won by McLaren's Niki Lauda, who would win his 3rd and final World Championship that year. The fastest lap of the race was set by Lauda's teammate Alain Prost (1:05.257) at an average speed of . Fittingly, the last F1 pole at Dijon was set by a French driver driving a French car, with Patrick Tambay recording a 1:02.200 in his factory Renault RE50 turbo. Tambay led the race for the first 47 laps before being passed by Lauda, the Frenchman eventually finishing 2nd, seven seconds behind the McLaren. Long-distance racing continued, with a race in the FIA GT Championship held there in 1998 for instance. Although Formula One has not returned to Dijon since 1984, the circuit continues to be used today for minor, mostly local races. These include club level events and motorcycle racing, and truck racing events have been held there since 1988. The track was renovated in 2001, when a go-cart track was also added.

Apollodotus II (Greek: ) was an Indo-Greek king who ruled in the western and eastern parts of Punjab. Bopearachchi dates him to c. 80‚Äì65 BC, and R. C. Senior to c. 85‚Äì65 BC. Apollodotos II was an important ruler who seems to have re-established the Indo-Greek kingdom to some extent of its former glory. Taxila in western Punjab was reconquered from nomad Scythian rule. Rule Apollodotus II seems to have been a member of the dynasty of Menander I, since he used their typical deity Athena Alkidemos on most of his silver, and also Menander's title Soter (Greek: , \\"the Saviour\\"), on all his coins. On some coins, he also calls himself Philopator (Greek: , \\"the father-loving\\"), which proves that his father had been king before him. R C Senior guesses that Amyntas or Epander could have been his father. Apollodotus' reign possibly began in the Punjab, when the Scythian king Maues ruled in Gandhara and its capital Taxila. What probably happened is that Apollodotus II took over Taxila after the death of Maues, though it is uncertain whether he defeated Maues or his descendants, or was allied or related to the dynasty of Maues. The late Indo-Greeks may have been rather mixed with both Indians and Scythians. R C Senior suggests that Apollodotus had struck an alliance with another Scythian king, Azes I. The Scythian hold on Gandhara loosened after the death of Maues, and petty kings of mixed or uncertain origin, like Artemidorus the son of Maues, Telephus and perhaps Menander II emerged in the area. These kings posed no threat to Apollodotus II, who on some of his coins assumed the title Basileus Megas (Greek: , \\"Great King\\"), in echo of Maues' boastful title \\"Great King of Kings\\". After the death of Apollodotus II, the Indo-Greek kingdom fragmented once more. Coins of Apollodotus II thumbupright=1.5rightIndo-Greek king Apollodotus II (80-65 BC). Obv.: Greek legend reads, \\"of Apollodotus King Great Saviour and Fatherloving\\". Rev.: Legend in Kharoshthi script Tratarasa Maharajasa Apalatasa \\"Saviour King Appolodotus\\", with goddess Athena (type of Menander I). Apollodotus II issued a large number of coins. He struck silver with a diademed portrait on the obverse and a reverse of Athena Alkidemos, and also a unique coin with the reverse of a king, possibly Alexander the Great, sitting on a horned horse similar to Alexander's Bucephalus and holding his hand in a benediction gesture. He struck bronzes with Apollo/tripod, a type introduced by his namesake Apollodotus I. The coins of Apollodotus II are of different qualities. Some still have the realistic portraits characteristic of the earlier Indo-Greek coins, and Bopearachchi attributes these series to the western part of his kingdom. Others are badly struck and/or have clumsy and distorted portraits, and these Bopearachchi interprets as belonging to newly opened mints in eastern Punjab, presumably struck by Indian celators with little knowledge of Greek engraving skills. On some of his coins there are both extra monograms in shape of Kharosthi letters. These monograms are interpreted, which was suggested already by W.W. Tarn, to have belonged to officials with Indian names. The coins therefore indicate that Apollodotus II relied more on his Indian subjects than earlier kings, and also opened new mints in eastern Punjab where Greek presence was scarce.

Hughes also produced the film, while Howard Hawks served as an uncredited co-director. The film is notable as Russell's breakthrough role, turning the young actress into a sex symbol and a Hollywood icon. Later advertising billed Russell as the sole star. Plot Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) welcomes his old friend Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) to Lincoln, New Mexico. Doc is looking for his stolen horse and finds it in the possession of Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel). Despite this, the two gunfighters take a liking to each other, much to Pat's disgust. This does not prevent Doc from trying to steal the horse back late that night, but Billy is waiting for him outside the barn. After that, Billy decides to sleep in the barn, and shots are fired at him. He overpowers his ambusher, who turns out to be curvaceous young Rio McDonald (Jane Russell), Doc's love-interest, who is out to avenge her dead brother. It is implied that he rapes her after ripping off her dress.20/20 Movie Review of The Outlaw (1943) The next day, a stranger offers to shoot Pat in the back while Billy distracts the lawman. However, he is only setting the Kid up. Billy, suspicious as always, guns him down just before being shot himself. There are no witnesses, and Pat tries to arrest Billy. Pat does not understand when Doc sides with the Kid. As the pair start to leave, Pat shoots Billy, forcing Doc to shoot the gun out of his hand and kill two of Pat's men. Doc flees with Billy to the home of Rio and her aunt, Guadalupe (Mimi Aguglia). With a posse after them, Doc rides away. Instead of killing the unconscious Kid, Rio instead nurses him to health, a process that takes a month. By the time Doc returns, Rio has fallen in love with her patient. Doc is furious that Billy has stolen his girlfriend. After Doc's anger subsides a bit, the Kid gives him a choice: the horse or Rio. To Billy's annoyance, Doc picks the horse. Angered that both men value the animal more than her, Rio fills their canteens with sand. The two ride off without noticing. On the trail, they find themselves being pursued by Pat and a posse. The pair surmise that Rio tipped the sheriff off. Doc kills a few men from long range, but leaves Pat unharmed. When Doc wakes one morning, he finds Billy gone and Pat waiting to handcuff him and take him back. Stopping at Rio's, the two men find that Billy has left Rio tied up in sight of water out of revenge. Suspecting that Billy loves Rio (even if he himself does not realize it) and will return to free her, Pat waits. Sure enough, the Kid comes back and is captured. On the way back to town, however, they find hostile Mescaleros all around. Pat reluctantly frees his prisoners and returns their revolvers after extracting a promise from Doc that he will give them back and make Billy do the same. They manage to elude the Indians, but Doc refuses to honor his word. As Doc tries to leave with his horse, Billy stops him. The two men decide to have a duel, with a pleased Pat expecting Billy to lose. However, as they await the signal (the end of a clock signalling eight o'clock), Billy realizes that Doc is a true friend, and moves his hands away from his guns. Doc tries to provoke him, inflicting minor wounds in one hand and both ears, but the Kid still will not fire. The two reconcile. Furious, Pat calls Doc out, despite not having a chance. Doc makes no attempt to shoot his friend and is fatally wounded. Pat is aghast. After Doc is buried, Pat offers to give Billy their friend's revolvers. He also persuades Billy to give him his guns, saying that he can claim that it is Billy in the grave. The Kid can leave his past behind him and have a fresh start in life. However, it is all a trick. Pat had removed the firing pins from Doc's revolvers. However, while comparing the guns, he inadvertently switched one of Doc's for his. As a result, neither his gun nor Pat's fires. Billy pulls out a second, working gun. He handcuffs Pat, judging that the lawman will still state that Billy is dead rather than admit the Kid left him helpless. As he is riding away, Billy stops and looks back; an overjoyed Rio gets on his horse.

He employed his engineering skills to design a new cantilevered underwire bra to emphasize her figure. Hughes added curved structural steel rods that were sewn into the brassiere under each breast cup and connected to the bra's shoulder straps. This arrangement allowed the breasts to be pulled upwards and made it possible to move the shoulder straps away from the neck. As a result, the design allowed for a larger amount of Russell's bosom to be exposed. Contrary to many media reports afterward, Russell did not wear the bra during filming; according to her 1988 autobiography, she said the bra was so uncomfortable that she secretly discarded it. She wrote that the \\"ridiculous\\" contraption hurt so much that she wore it for only a few minutes, and instead wore her own bra. To prevent Hughes from noticing, Russell padded the cups with tissue and tightened the shoulder straps before returning to the set. She later said \\"I never wore it in The Outlaw, and he never knew. He wasn‚Äôt going to take my clothes off to check if I had it on. I just told him I did.\\" The famed bra ended up in a Hollywood museum‚Äîa false witness to the push-up myth. Although the film was completed in February 1941, Hughes had trouble getting it approved by the Hollywood Production Code Administration due to its emphasis on and display of Russell's breasts. The Production Administration set the standards for morally acceptable content in motion pictures, and ordered cuts to the film. Hughes reluctantly removed about 40 feet, or a half-minute, of footage that prominently featured Russell's bosom. However, 20th Century Fox decided to cancel its agreement to release The Outlaw; as a result, Hughes stood to lose millions of dollars. Ever the resourceful businessman, he schemed to create a public outcry for his film to be banned. Hughes had all his managers call ministers, women's clubs and housewives, informing them about the 'lewd picture' Hughes was about to release. The public responded by protesting and trying to have the film banned, which generated the publicity Hughes needed to establish a demand for the film and get it released. The resulting controversy created enough interest to get The Outlaw into theaters for just one week in 1943, and then it was pulled due to violations of the Production Code. The film was released widely on April 23, 1946 when RKO Radio Pictures premiered the film in San Francisco, where it became a box-office hit. By the end of 1946, the film had earned $3 million in domestic rentals. Two further re- releases in 1950 and 1952 brought its lifetime rental earnings to $5.075 million. Hughes then sued Classic Film Museum, Inc. and Alan J. Taylor for unlawful distribution of Hell's Angels, Scarface, and The Outlaw. When it emerged that The Outlaw had fallen into the public domain in 1969 for lack of copyright renewal, the case was settled, with Classic Film Museum agreeing to stop distribution of the two copyrighted titles, and Hughes withdrawing his claim on The Outlaw.Court case: Agreement, Summa Corporation v. Classic Film Museum, Inc., Civil Action No. 75-81 N.D. HowarUnited Artistsd Hughes Files collection, Archives Division, Texas State Library.. See note #17. The film was later colorized twice. The first colorization was released by Hal Roach Studios in 1988. The second colorized version, produced by Legend Films, was released to DVD on June 16, 2009, featuring both the newly colorized edition and a restored black-and-white edition of the film. The DVD version also featured an audio commentary by Jane Russell and Hughes' alleged wife, actress Terry Moore. Russell approved of the colorization, stating \\"The color looked great. It was not too strong, like in many of the early colorized movies that made the films look cheap.\\" Author Robert Lang writes that the true expression of sexuality in this film comes from the relationship between Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid. He further writes that the film is about \\"the complications that arise when Doc Holliday falls in love with Billy the Kid, and Pat Garett becomes jealous of the bond that develops between the two men.\\" Hughes scholars and historians scoff at this highly subjective Hollywood interpretation and suggest that Hughes would have never allowed any form of sexuality to be expressed in his films that might take away from the impact and value of his starlet, Jane Russell.

Early years Rafael Angel Leavitt Rey, born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was the second of four siblings in his family, and was born to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother.\\"History of Puerto Rico: A Panorama of Its People \\"; by: Fernando Pico; Publisher: Markus Wiener Publishers; ; He and his brothers became orphans at an early age and were raised by their aunt in the Puerta de Tierra section of San Juan. Leavitt was able to attend a private school, Colegio San Agust√≠n, where he received his primary and secondary .[education.http://www.prpop.org/biografias/r_bios/raphy_leavitt.shtml Popular Culture] During his childhood, he was also able to take classes at The Academy of Accordions. He participated in an accordion orchestra and was named \\"premier\\" accordionist. Leavitt enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico to study Business Administration. It was during this period of his life that he debuted as a professional musician when he joined two cousins who shared Rey as last name to form the \\"Combo Los Rey\\". After four years in the university, Leavitt earned his bachelor's degree in business administration and graduated with high honors. La Selecta In 1966, Leavitt organized an orchestra which he named \\"Los Se√±oriales\\". This was the first time that he assumed the role of orchestra director. Later on, he renamed the orchestra \\"La Banda Latina\\" (Latin Band). In 1970, Leavitt organized an orchestra which was to have a different sound and style. He wanted to select the band's repertoire from songs with a particular, positive social message and philosophy, and arranged his new band's sound as to sound as raw and powerful as the typical all- trombone salsa sound in vogue at the time (made popular by Willie Col√≥n), but with the addition of trumpets to lighten up the sound melodically. He composed some of the songs of this new group, which he named \\"La Selecta\\". Ever since its beginning, La Selecta has featured Coamo-born Sammy Marrero, considered by many as a gentlemanly character in salsa, as one of its singers. Marrero, who has always been strongly influenced by jibaro music, had a chance to show his dramatic singing style in early hits such as the anthemic J√≠baro Soy, a patriotic Puerto Rican song unusual for the times, Payaso, and El Buen Pastor. However, it is the band's signature song, La Cuna Blanca, that Marrero's voice is mostly associated with.Unofficial Site - Biography, Discography, Lyrics =Van accident= On their way to a dance in Connecticut on October 28, 1972, the band's van had an accident, killing trumpet player Luis Maisonet and severely injuring Leavitt. Leavitt was in a coma, he sustained several fractures in his hip (he walks with a limp ever since), vertebrae and ribs in the accident, and was placed on intensive care. After he recovered from the coma, he had a persistent vision of an empty white crib, from which baby cries could be heard. Somehow he associated the vision with his trumpet player, unaware that he had died in the accident. Maisonet was reportedly dressed in black, and telling him: \\"Raphy, I'll help you from here\\". When fellow band members mustered the will to tell Leavitt about the player's death, Leavitt claimed that he already knew about it. After seven months of recovery, Leavitt and his band recorded the La Cuna Blanca as a tribute song, with Leavitt writing dramatic lyrics interpreted by Marrero, arranged to an upbeat, heavily contrasting cha-cha-cha beat. The bittersweet feeling evoked by the song has made it a popular farewell song at Puerto Rican funerals. Marrero's daughter's death from a stray bullet at a reggaeton club in 2005 brought the song back to light in the collective Puerto Rican conscience, and had the dramatic consequence of having Marrero sing it in a tribute concert to La Selecta the day immediately after her death.\\"La Selecta - 30 Aniversario; by:Raphie Leavitt; ASIN: B00008BRD2 In 1978, he discovered the young singer Tony Vega, who was to become a legend among salsa singers in his own right. Leavitt and La Selecta were responsible for the introduction of salsa in many countries. In the 1980s, Leavitt became an independent producer and produced two records for Bobby Valent√≠n Bronco Records. In the 1990s, He established his own record recording company, R. L. Records. The company's first production was the album titled \\"Provocame\\" (Provoke Me), which became a \\"hit\\" in Puerto Rico, United States and South America. European Tour In 1993, Leavitt and La Selecta made their European debut in Spain. During that tour, they also held concerts in Germany, Switzerland, Italy and France.

Life He was the son of Count Engelbert III of Gorizia and his wife Matilda, daughter of Berthold I of Istria and sister of the powerful Andechs duke Berthold IV of Merania. Through his mother, Meinhard inherited the County of Mittelburg in central Istria. His father died in 1220, nevertheless he did not come in control over all his family's possessions around Lienz and Gorizia upon the death of his uncle Count Meinhard the Elder. About 1237 he married Adelaide (Adelheid), one of the two daughters of Count Albert IV of Tyrol, attended with reasonable succession prospects in the Tyrolean lands. Meinhard strongly supported the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II in his fierce conflict with Pope Innocent IV and in return was appointed Imperial governor of the Duchy of Styria and the March of Carniola after the last Babenberg duke Frederick the Warlike had died without heirs in 1246. From 1250 onwards also governor in the princeless Duchy of Austria, Meinhard facing the fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty did not prevail: his rule in Carniola was challenged by the Carinthian ducal House of Sponheim, and in Austria and Styria he was expelled by the Bohemian prince Ottokar II P≈ôemysl in 1251. During the turmoil after the death of Emperor Frederick II, Count Meinhard, backed by his father-in-law Albert IV of Tyrol, tried to gain control over the Duchy of Carinthia but failed in an unsuccessful campaign against Duke Bernhard von Spanheim and his son Philip, the elected Archbishop of Salzburg. On 8 September 1252, he was finally defeated and arrested at Greifenburg. According to the Peace of Lieserhofen, concluded on 27 December 1252, he had to give his sons Meinhard IV and Albert to Archbishop Philip as hostages. Both were imprisoned at Hohenwerfen Castle in Salzburg and not released until 1258. Meinhard and Albert IV of Tyrol also had to pay a compensation and to renounce certain possessions including Mittersill, Virgen, Matrei and Oberdrauburg. Upon the death of Count Albert IV of Tyrol in 1253, Meinhard and his brother- in-law, Count Gebhard of Hirschberg, split Tyrol, of which Meinhard took the southern part with Meran, in constant quarrels with the Trento bishops. His son Meinhard II later also acquired the Hirschberg lands from Gebhard's heirs in 1284 and two years later even received Carinthia from the hands of the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany. Meinhard I died in 1258 and is buried at Tirol Castle. Marriage and children About 1237, Meinhhard married Adelaide, daughter of Albert IV, Count of Tyrol.

It was formerly broadcast in the United States until late September 2010 on This TV.  Characters  King Hugo III - King Hugo III is the king of the land of the potatoes. He is easily upset, stubborn and hates the local dragon or anyone standing in his way or stopping things from going his way, he's almost not in a good mood mostly because Dragon gives him a hard time with all his flaming whenever they meet, or if Hugo teases him and messes with his things, even when Hugo is minding his own business, and does absolutely nothing, Dragon would still flame him anyway whether he likes it or not, he mistreats everyone bossing them around so much which makes him mad, he's always getting mad at Harry and giving him a hard time whenever he fails and not do his jobs right. Voiced by Danny Wells Harry - Harry is King Hugo's torturer and right hand henchman. He tends to be absentminded and often does most of his worker's dirty work. Knights - In every episode a new knight (or lady knight for girls) that ranged from a warrior to a scientist, appears and swears to slay or snare the dragon or make it domestic in some way, generally, in return for the hand of Melody the Princess or other forms of reward. They usually end up fighting against Hugo or being chased out of the kingdom. Melody - Melody, the blonde-haired princess, loves the dragon, and if anything happens to him, her love with Riri will end, so she thwarts plans to kill the dragon. Almost all knights offer to marry her, in which she either falls into a trance of joy or acts disgusted. She wears a pink gown and a crown that is smoother than the King Hugo's, Dragon has never flamed her not even once, because they're friends. Voiced by Carrie Finlay Riri - Riri, the hero of the series, is the court jester, who loves Melody and thwarts plans to kill Dragon, he often teases Juju which makes him mad sometimes, Dragon has once flamed him by accident except he wasn't aiming for him, he was trying to aim for King Hugo and the knight. Voiced by Mark Hauser Juju - Juju is a child living in the castle who helps Riri, but is easily upset and moody, he likes pulling pranks and making fun of King Hugo just for fun, he's good friends with Dragon who he always tries helping, he teams up with Melody and Riri saving Dragon's life and avoiding King Hugo's ideas on kicking him out, Dragon has once flamed him by accident and got mad at him for ruining his favorite ball, but after while, he forgives him and they both become friends again, he knows Dragon didn't mean to hurt his feelings from before, because it happens. Voiced by Annie Bovaird Dragon - Dragon lives peacefully in the kingdom, but because he has a hatred of crowns finds himself uncontrollably willing to flame breathe Hugo into a pile of living ashes every time they meet, even when King Hugo is minding his own business, Dragon still has the plan to flame him anyway no matter what, even for nothing, whether he likes it or not, he can't talk, his voice is only heard when he's sighing, laughing, crying, yelling, screaming, and humming, his breath is always stinky whenever he spreads it around and flames someone, he would even sometimes be stinky himself. He often sometimes has a crush on a lady dragon almost known as his girlfriend, but he most likely loves being alone, he's good friends with Melody, Juju, and Riri whom he would never flame to ashes except maybe by accident, because they're all best friends and they try helping him whenever King Hugo has a plan of getting rid of him, he can even flame through pictures, ice, and the phone. Voiced by Mark Camacho Merlin - Merlin is the king's loyal practitioner of magic. This wizard's spells and potions usually don't work and they end up exploding in Hugo's face. Merlin frequently helps the princess, Riri and Juju to help save the dragon. Voiced by John Vamvas Roger the Talking Carrot - Roger is a carrot that advises the knight on how to defeat the dragon. He has no other use to the story other than revealing the dragon's weaknesses, and perhaps a tasty snack if he upsets the knight. Voiced by John Locke Plot The show generally begins with a new knight coming in to defeat the dragon, and after an amusing \\"battle\\" leaving either scared, running or happy.

Design A sectioned illustration of the Austin A40's 1200cc engine ‚Äì the direct predecessor to the B series The precursor of the \\"B\\" series engine was a 1200 cc Overhead Valve (OHV) engine which was used in the 1947-1952 Austin A40 Devon, and, in slightly modified form, in the 1953 Austin A40 Somerset. This engine had many of the same basic dimensions as one of Austin's pre-war sidevalve engines - the 1125cc engine fitted in the Austin 10 which had the 89mm (3.5in) stroke common to all later B-Series engines, allowing the use of much of the same installed equipment to produce the block and crankshaft - but to an all-new OHV design. Beyond this relationship to the pre-war Ten's engine, the lineage of the new OHV 1200cc power unit was somewhat complex - in the rest of its design it was in essence a scaled-down version of the 2199cc engine introduced in 1945 on the Austin 16 hp. The design of this unit were derived from the much larger OHV engine developed for the wartime Austin K5 military truck, which used a 3995cc straight-six engine (minus two cylinders this engine became the 2660cc four-cylinder engine used in the Austin A90 Atlantic and the Austin-Healey 100). The K5 engine was broadly an Austin version of the 3519cc engine built by Bedford for its military trucks, and in turn the Bedford engine was similar in design to the Chevrolet 235 straight- six engine - Bedford and Chevrolet both being part of General Motors. The common features found on all these engines, from the Chevrolet 235 to the Austin 1200cc, include the design of the valve gear and the cylinder head, especially the siamesed cylinder head ports. The A40 engine was originally drawn up to be produced in two capacities of 990cc and 1200cc to fall into the Eight and Ten tax horsepower classes. Before the A40 was launched, the British government removed the tax horsepower system in favour of a flat tax rate making the smaller capacity redundant. Therefore only the 1200cc version was built but could not be increased in capacity any further since it was already nearly at the maximum bore and stroke dimensions permitted by the design of the block casting. Austin realised that eventually they would need an engine that could power many of its forthcoming medium-sized cars, and this would require an engine of at least 1500 cc capacity. Since the A40 Devon engine could not have its capacity enlarged, a new engine needed to be designed and built. The design of this new engine commenced around January 1952, and was designated as the \\"B\\" series. The first production version of the B series retained the same 1200cc capacity as the A40 engine and, superficially, appeared to be identical, with the same valve gear, same cylinder head design, same positioning of its ancillary parts (many of which were interchangeable with the older engine) and so on. But the B-series block and head were slightly larger in both length and width and the block had thicker cylinder wall castings making the new engine heavier than the A40 motor. This was to allow room for enlargement of the cylinder bore to provide the larger capacities foreseen by BMC. The stroke was retained at and was never altered. Originally of approximately 1.2 Litre capacity, later displacements ranged widely from 1.2 L to 2.4 L, the latter being an Australia only production six- cylinder variant. The most common engine sizes were 1.5 L and 1.8 L and saw service in a number of vehicles. This included a version of the engine built under license in India by Hindustan Motors for its Ambassador series of cars.Hindustan Ambassador. (webpage) Retrieved on 2 January 2016 from http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_hindustan_ambassador.php Petrol versions were produced in the greatest numbers, but diesel versions exist for both cars and marine applications. Construction The engine was of conventional construction with a one-piece crankcase and cylinder block in cast iron with the crankcase extending down to the lowest level of the main bearing caps; with a cylinder head, also usually in cast iron, and a sump made from pressed steel for rear-wheel drive vehicles. Early engines used a three- bearing crankshaft, but later engines used five bearings. On all except the rare twin overhead camshaft variant, the camshaft ‚Äî which was chain driven and mounted low in the block ‚Äî operated the overhead valves via pushrods and rocker arms. The two inlet ports in the non-crossflow cylinder head were shared between cylinders 1 + 2 and 3 + 4 and the three exhaust ports between cylinder 1, 2 + 3 and 4. Valve clearance was adjustable by screws and locknuts on the rocker arms.Austin Motor Company. Austin A40 Models Service Manual. Austin, Birmingham, UK. Another unconventional characteristic of the engine is that the bore spacing is not constant between all four bores. The distance from cylinder 1 to 2 is 3.4375\\"; 2 to 3 =3.875\\" ;and 3 to 4 =3.4375\\". The B series shares many design features (such as the heart-shaped combustion chambers and siamese inlet ports designed by Harry Weslake), as well as its basic layout and general appearance, with the smaller BMC A-series engine. However another difference was its block's full-depth skirt which provided excellent bottom-end strength. This made the engine highly durable and suitable for developing into diesel versions in later years. Engine types = litre engines= The version was the first version of the engine.

Output was at 6700 rpm in the high-compression (9.9:1) version and in the optional low- compression (8.3:1) version. The engine block was cast iron, but the crossflow eight-port cylinder head was of aluminium alloy. Drive to the twin camshafts was by chain from a gear-driven, half-speed shaft running in the space that would have been occupied by the conventional camshaft. This engine gained a reputation for being unreliable in service, especially in the high-compression version which needed high-octane fuel, but this has now been largely overcome. The piston burning habits ‚Äî thought to be the result of ignition timing ‚Äî was later discovered to be due to a vibration induced lean burn situation involving the float bowls, easily correctable by flexibly mounting the carburettors. A total of 2,111 cars were built, in both coup√© and roadster versions. A very few engines with the special displacement of were produced for racing purposes.

He was the son of Duke Louis V of Bavaria with Countess Margaret of Tyrol and as such also the last descendant of the Tyrolean branch of the House of Gorizia (Meinhardiner dynasty). Biography Meinhard was born in Landshut during the reign of his Wittelsbach grandfather, Emperor Louis IV, who had prevailed against his Habsburg rival Frederick the Fair. His father Louis V, the eldest son of the emperor, in 1323 was enfeoffed with the Margraviate of Brandenburg upon the extinction of the Ascanian margraves. He did however concentrate on his Bavarian heritage and in 1342 married Countess Margaret of Tyrol, whose first matrimony with John Henry of Luxembourg was not yet divorced. This marriage earned the couple not only the enmity of the House of Luxembourg, but also the excommunication by Pope Clement VI. When Emperor Louis IV died in 1347, his son was not able to obtain the Imperial Crown, which passed from the Wittelsbach dynasty to the Luxembourg scion Charles IV. In the course of a rapprochement between the Wittelsbach and Habsburg families, Louis' son Meinhard was raised at the Habsburg court in Vienna and when he came of age, he was married to Margaret of Austria (1346‚Äì1366) on 4 September 1359 in Passau. Margaret was a daughter of his father's ally, the Habsburg duke Albert II of Austria, and on this occasion his parents were absolved from the excommunication. After the sudden death of Louis V in 1361, his seventeen-year-old son ascended to rule in Upper Bavaria and in the County of Tyrol, in which he was strongly influenced by the Bavarian nobility. Meinhard also had to fend off attacks by his Wittelsbach uncle Duke Stephen II of Bavaria-Landshut and his Palatinate cousins. He fled to the court of the Prince-Bishop of Eichst√§tt, was temporarily arrested in Munich and finally retired to the Tyrolean home lands of his mother, possibly with the help of the Habsburg duke Rudolf IV of Austria. Meinhard III died at Tirol Castle near Meran in 1363. His early death induced his mother Margaret to deny the inheritance claims raised by Count Meinhard VI of Gorizia and the House of Wittelsbach, when she ceded Tyrol to Duke Rudolf IV of Austria. Therefore, Meinhard's uncle Stephen II of Bavaria-Landshut, who had succeeded him in Upper Bavaria, invaded Tyrol but finally released the county in 1369, in return for a huge financial compensation.

Etymology  The term is probably related to bole, meaning a tree trunk.New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993 The earliest citation given by the Oxford English Dictionary (referring to a maritime bollard) dates from 1844, although a reference in the Caledonian Mercury in 1817 describes bollards as huge posts. Previously, simpler terms such as \\"post\\" appear to have been used. The Norman-French name boulard (still often found in Normandy) and Dutch bolder may be related.  History  East India House, Leadenhall Street, London: an engraving of 1766. Six bollards stand in front of the building. The Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome, painted by Canaletto in 1742. Five bollards stand beyond the arch, apparently placed to protect it from vehicle damage. From the 17th and 18th centuries, old cannon were often used as bollards on quaysides to help moor ships alongside. The cannon would be buried in the ground muzzle-first to approximately half or two-thirds of their length, leaving the breech (rear end) projecting above ground for attaching ropes. Such cannon can still occasionally be found. Bollards from the 19th century were purpose-made, but often inherited a very similar \\"cannon\\" shape. Wooden posts were used for basic traffic management from at least the beginning of the 18th century. An early well-documented case is that of the \\"two oak-posts\\" set up next to the medieval Eleanor cross at Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, in 1721, at the expense of the Society of Antiquaries of London, \\"to secure Waltham Cross from injury by Carriages\\". Similar posts can be seen in many historic paintings and engravings. In the Netherlands, the Amsterdammertjes of Amsterdam were first erected in the 19th century. They became popular symbols of the city, but they are now gradually being removed and replaced with elevated sidewalks.  Types  = Maritime= Utrecht, Netherlands features bollards made from cannons In the maritime contexts in which the term originates, a bollard is either a wooden or iron post found as a deck-fitting on a ship or boat, and used to secure ropes for towing, mooring and other purposes; or its counterpart on land, a short wooden, iron or stone post on a quayside to which craft can be moored. The Sailor's Word-Book of 1867 defines a bollard in a more specific context as \\"a thick piece of wood on the head of a whale-boat, round which the harpooner gives the line a turn, in order to veer it steadily, and check the animal's velocity\\".Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press, 2006 () Bollards on ships, when arranged in pairs, may also be referred to as \\"bitts\\". Mooring bollards are seldom exactly cylindrical, but typically have a larger diameter near the top to discourage mooring warps (docklines) from coming loose. Single bollards sometimes include a cross rod to allow the mooring lines to be bent into a figure eight. Small mushroom- bollards are found on lock approaches for advancing boats waiting for lock access. A conventional measure of the pulling or towing power of a watercraft is known as bollard pull, and is defined as the measured force exerted by a vessel under full power on a shore-mounted bollard through a tow-line. = Road traffic =  Roadside bollards  City of London colours Bollards can be used either to control traffic intake size by limiting movements, or to control traffic speed by narrowing the available space. Israel's Transportation Research Institute found that putting bollards at highway exits to control traffic also reduced accidents.Driver behaviour and accident records at unsignalized urban intersections. Abishai Polusa, Department of Civil Engineering & Transportation Research Institute, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel. June 1984. Available online 4 July 2002. Bollards used to protect a buildingPermanent bollards can be used for traffic-control or terrorist prevention purposes. They may be mounted near enough to each other that they block ordinary cars/trucks, for instance, but spaced widely enough to permit special-purpose vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians to pass through. Bollards may also be used to enclose car-free zones. Bollards and other street furniture can also be used to control overspill parking onto sidewalks and verges. Bollards can be temporary and portable, such as this traffic control bollard separating the road from the worksite. Tall (1.15 meter/4 foot) slim (10 cm/4 inch) fluorescent red or orange plastic bollards with reflective tape and removable heavy rubber bases are frequently used in road traffic control where traffic cones would be inappropriate due to their width and ease of movement. Also referred to as \\"delineators\\", the bases are usually made from recycled rubber, and can be easily glued to the road surface to resist movement following minor impacts from passing traffic. The term \\"T-top bollards\\" refers to the T-bar moulded into the top for tying tape. Bollards are regarded as an economical and safe delineation system for motorways and busy arterial roads; and, in conjunction with plastic tape, for pedestrian control. Traffic bollards used in the US are very similar to devices found throughout the UK, with the following exceptions: *The traffic bollard shell displays the MUTCD (Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices) \\"Keep Right\\" symbol (R4-7). In addition, the traffic bollard also has a yellow diamond below the \\"Keep Right\\" symbol instead of a yellow shield. *Unlike many existing traffic bollards found in the UK, most new modern traffic bollards installed along roadways today are made of materials that make them completely collapsible. When struck by a vehicle at low or high speed, the traffic bollard shell reverts to its original position with minimal to no damage to the unit.  Traffic-island bollards  1980s traffic bollard in Prague, Czechia Traffic bollards are used to highlight traffic islands. They are primarily used at intersections within the splitter islands (a raised or painted area on the approach of a roundabout used to separate entering from exiting traffic, deflect and slow entering traffic, and provide a stopping place for pedestrians crossing the road in two stages)U.S. Department of Transportation: \\"Roundabouts:An Informational Guide\\", FHWA- RD-00-067, 2000 and at the ends of pedestrian refuge islands, typically located at mid-block pedestrian crosswalks. Illuminated bollards are also used to supplement street signs and street lighting to provide a visual cue to approaching drivers that an obstacle exists ahead during hours of darkness and during periods of low visibility:\\"Road Traffic Signs and Internally Illuminated Bollards. Specification for Internally Illuminated Bollards\\", British Standards Institution, 1980Philip Weber, Scott Ritchie: \\"Internationally Recognized Roundabout Signs\\", Paper for the Transportation Research Board National Roundabout Conference, 2005 (fog, rain, snow, haze, etc.) and to indicate that braking may be required. Illuminated bollards are also used in Hong Kong, a former British colony. Internally illuminated traffic bollards have been in existence throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland since the 1930s, although the term \\"bollard\\" only seems to have been in common use since the late 1940s. An illuminated bollard has a recessed base light unit in the foundation which illuminates the traffic bollard from all angles.Simmonsigns, Simbol Product Specifications, 2006 The main components are housed below the road or pedestrian surface (typically a concrete surface). Therefore, if a vehicle strikes the traffic bollard, the units below the surface are not damaged. Reflective bollards may also be used; they need no power or maintenance, and can be built to recover to their normal position after being struck. Internally illuminated traffic bollards direct vehicles to the appropriate side of an island in the United Kingdom.  Bell  A bell bollard is especially useful to deflect heavy vehicles. A bell bollard is a style of bollard designed to deflect vehicle tires. The wheel mounts the lower part of the bollard and is deflected by its increasing slope. Such bollards are effective against heavy goods vehicles that may damage or destroy conventional bollards or other types of street furniture. A variant on the bell bollard is the \\"Martello bollard\\", its sloped shape inspired by the profile of historic Martello towers.  Removable  Bollards may be hinged at ground level, allowing them to be folded flat to permit vehicles to drive over them. In such cases they are generally fitted with padlocks at the base, to prevent being lowered without proper authorization. Rising bollards can be retracted into the roadway to allow traffic to pass, or deployed to stop it. Removable bollards may be fitted into a permanent metal ground socket, from which they can be removed entirely to allow traffic to pass. A polypropylene ground socket is also available that protects the paving and foundations from damage when the bollard is struck. This design uses a self- locking taper to enable bollards to be easily removed and relocated. Retractable or \\"rising\\" bollards can be lowered entirely below the road surface (generally using an electric or hydraulic mechanism) to enable traffic to pass, or raised to block traffic. Rising bollards are used to secure sensitive areas from attack, or to enforce traffic rules that are time related, or to restrict access to particular classes of traffic. Manually retractable bollards (lowered by a key mechanism) are found useful in some cases since they do not require retrofitting into existing landscapes, or any electrical hookups or hydraulic systems. The term \\"robotic bollards\\" has been applied to traffic barricades capable of moving themselves into position on a roadway. Self-righting or self-recovering bollards can take a nudge from a vehicle and return to the upright position without causing damage to the bollard or vehicle. They are popular in car park buildings and other areas of high vehicle usage.  Flexible  Flexible bollards are bollards designed to bend when struck by vehicles. They are typically made from synthetic plastic or rubber that is stiff on its own, but pliable under the weight of a car or truck. When struck, flexible bollards give way to some extent, reducing damage to vehicles and surrounding surfaces, and return to their original, upright position. Some flexible bollards do not provide physical protection from vehicles; rather they offer clear visual guidance for drivers. Other flexible bollards have been designed to provide physical protection as well as reduced damage by incorporating strong elastic materials. These can be all plastic or plastic/steel hybrids but combine varying degrees of stopping power and flexibility.  Racing  Some forms of motorsport use removable, high-visibility bollards on road courses and street courses to mark the apex of certain corners. They are used to deter cutting a corner too tightly and violating track limits: in most racing series, drivers may incur a penalty for colliding with or driving inside these bollards. Racing bollards are very lightweight and built to break off at the base when hit so as to not damage the vehicle; this feature of bollards makes them favored over \\"sausage kerbs\\"‚Äîalso used to prevent cutting corners‚Äîwhich are elevated rigid structures that run along the inside of a turn. In contrast to bollards, sausage kerbs are much more unforgiving, and vehicles that hit them can be severely damaged or launched airborne upon contact.  Covers  A more recent development in bollard technology are bollard covers. They are used by many industries and communities as a cost-effective way to increase safety and refresh old and worn-out-looking bollards without having to completely replace the original bollard. They slip over the existing bollard and can come in a variety of shapes and styles. Because they are easily removable, they can be replaced quickly, and depending on their material they may never need painting and are resistant to scratching and other wear and tear. Traffic bollard covers are typically made of tough recycled plastic and have high-visibility colours to ensure motorists see them. Decorative bollards are used in street areas to enhance display and may come with LED lights to increase visibility and safety at night. = Protective = ram-raiders A planter provides protection in Washington, DC Bollards are used by government agencies and private businesses to protect public spaces, buildings, and the people in them from car ramming attacks. They usually consist of a simple steel post either anchored to concrete, cored into a hard surface, buried in the ground or secured on a self-locking taper or impact recovery system to protect the surrounding foundations when a bollard is struck. These bollards protect utilities, electronics, machinery, buildings, or pedestrians from accidental collisions by vehicles, including passenger vehicles, transport trucking, and fork lifts. As collisions can cause damage to vehicles, operators, or the bollards themselves, new bollards have been developed that absorb some of the impact energy, lessening the violence of the collision. Some are made of forgiving plastics while others are made of steel but fitted with an elastomer to absorb the impact energy. Bollards are widely used to contribute to safety and security. The American Bar Association (ABA) states that bollards are used to contribute to homeland security.Ernest B. Abbott and Otto J. Hetzel, \\"Homeland Security Begins at Home: Local Planning and Regulatory Review to Improve Security\\", in Rufus Calhoun Young, Jr. and Dwight H. Merriam, A Legal Guide to Homeland Security and Emergency Management for State and Local Governments, American Bar Association, 2006 The American National Institute of Building Sciences site‚Äîthe Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG)‚Äîrecommends in its Design Guidance that open spaces surrounding and contiguous to buildings be included as integral parts of a security design. There are two main kinds of security-related bollard: *non-crash-resistant bollards *crash- and attack- resistant bollards, a hardened barrier systems used to protect military, governmental and other buildings or compounds of higher security levels.Security for Building Occupants and Assets, Whole Building Design Guide , 14 December 2010. They are often used by retailers to prevent \\"ram-raiding\\" burglaries. Large concrete planters are a decorative alternative to traditional bollards. According to the National Institute of Building Sciences, non-crash-resistant bollards are \\"perceived impediments to access\\" and address the actions of two groups. *Law-abiding persons who comply with civil prescriptions of behavior as defined by the manner in which bollards are put to use; *Potentially threatening and disruptive persons for whom bollard applications are proscriptive by announcing their behavior is anticipated, and that additional levels of security await them. Rising bollards are increasingly common around the world to hinder vehicle-based terrorist actions from achieving close proximity to buildings, and are also used to prevent terrorist vehicle-ramming attacks such as the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack. They are also useful in mixed-use public spaces, which support both pedestrian use and emergency or service vehicle use. These bollards are usually priced between $11,000 to $100,000 depending on their ability to resist ramming vehicles, based on speed and size of the vehicle. The most expensive bollards can stop vehicles at speeds of about . High security bollards are impact-tested in accordance with one or more of three major crash test ratings for vehicle barriers. These are PAS 68 (UK), IWA-14 (International) and ASTM (US). Such bollards are used for hostile vehicle mitigation and are designed to protect against potential vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED) and vehicle as a weapon (VAW) attacks such as those seen in the Nice attack in 2016 and the Westminster Bridge attack in 2017. Bollard sleeves in various alloys or finishes are designed to cover security bollards to enhance their visual attractiveness. U-shaped bollards are typically used for the protection of equipment and are very common in areas that need coverage over a wider area than of a normal bollard, such as fuel stations and bike lanes. = Dragon's teeth = Large concrete structures called dragon's teeth were invented during World War II to slow down, stop or channel enemy tanks. = Lights = Lighting bollard in St David's, Pembrokeshire Bollard lights are a type of architectural outdoor lighting fixture comprising short, upright ground-mounted units, typically giving off light from the top or the sides, and used to illuminate walkways, steps or pathways. Solar bollards store energy during daylight hours in order to illuminate during night. They use either a photocell or algorithms that determine whether the solar cells are receiving light to determine when to illuminate. = Other applications = The National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities (NCEF), managed by the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS), cited three dozen applications of bollards. The following list of open areas is encompassed by the ABA, NCEF and WBDG recommendations: *Playgrounds *Trails/Trailheads *Roadways *Leisure Parks *Fire Access Lanes *Building Setbacks *Sports Field *Malls *Traffic Gates *Landscapes *Pathways *Site Utilities *Bus Em/Debarkation *Toll Booth *Bicycle Lane *Traffic Medians *Site Perimeters *Intersections *Store Fronts *Building Hardening *Vehicle Parking *Site Access Control *Site Surveillance *Vehicle Pick-Up  In fire emergencies  According to the International Fire Code (IFC-2009) and the American National Fire Protection Association Fire Code 1 (NFPA-1) all new buildings or renovated buildings must have fire access roadways to accommodate fire apparatus and crews and other first responders. Thus the choice of bollard styles must apply to the NFPA's Code 1710. Bollards are now designed in terms of how long it takes to remove or collapse them to allow first responders entry to the access roadway.Transportation Alternatives: Rethinking Bollards‚ÄìHow Bollards Can Save Lives, Prevent Injuries and Relieve Traffic Congestion in New York City.

Artwork  Figurative bollard sculptures in Geelong, Victoria Ex libris bollard outside Cambridge University Library, by Harry Gray In Geelong, Victoria, Australia, decorative bollards, sculpted and painted by Jan Mitchell, are placed around the city to enhance the landscape as a form of outdoor public sculpture. Usually they are made of timber, minimally modified from the traditionally cylindrical, wooden, maritime bollard shape, but brightly painted to resemble human figures. Such figures ‚Äì which may be historical or contemporary, particular or generic ‚Äì are sited singly or in clusters along the waterfront and in other areas where people gather. Decorative bollards have become a well-known feature of the city of Geelong and reflect its history as a major Australian port. In Antwerp, Belgium, artist Eddy Gabriel transformed a bollard to look like a toadstool in 1993. This example was followed by other artists, turning the quayside of the river Scheldt into a street art gallery. In Norwich, England, a set of 21 bollards was installed in 2008 in the Lanes area north of City Hall, designed by artist Oliver Creed and commissioned by the City Council as part of a regeneration programme. They are coloured \\"madder red\\", in reference to the red dye extracted from the madder plant and used for dying cloth, one of the city's major industries during the 16th century; and they bear bronze finials also alluding to local history. 10 of these depict the madder plant, while the other 11 have unique designs, usually relevant to the specific location in which the bollard is placed, including a scene of sheep-shearing, a Green Man, a swan's head in Swan Lane, and so on. On the forecourt of Cambridge University Library, England, a line of 14 bronze bollards made to resemble piles of books was installed in 2009. This work, Ex Libris, was created by sculptor Harry Gray. The ten outer bollards are static, but the \\"books\\" making up the four central bollards can be swivelled, so that the lettering on their spines aligns to form the Latin phrase Ex Libris (\\"from/out of the books\\"), commonly used on bookplates. Many other towns, such as Winchester, England and Pristina, Kosovo, have painted ordinary bollards in unusual decorative patterns.

Catarina made landfall on South Brazil at peak intensity, with the equivalent of Category 2 hurricane-force sustained winds, on March 28, 2004. The storm developed out of a stationary cold-core upper-level trough on March 12\\\\. Almost a week later, on March 19, a disturbance developed along the trough and traveled towards the east-southeast until March 22 when a ridge stopped the forward motion of the disturbance. The disturbance was in an unusually favorable environment with a slightly below-average wind shear and above-average sea surface temperatures. The combination of the two led to a slow transition from an extratropical cyclone to a subtropical cyclone by March 24\\\\. The storm continued to obtain tropical characteristics and became a tropical storm the next day while the winds steadily increased. The storm attained wind speeds of ‚Äîequivalent to a low-end Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale‚Äîon March 26\\\\. At that time, it was unofficially named Catarina and was also the first hurricane-strength tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Unusually favorable conditions persisted and Catarina continued to intensify, and was estimated to have peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of on March 28\\\\. The center of the storm made landfall between the cities of Passo de Torres and Balne√°rio Gaivota, Santa Catarina soon afterward. Catarina rapidly weakened upon landfall and dissipated later that day. Catarina was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in Brazil since the beginning of reliable records; hence, the infrastructure and population were not specifically prepared for it, which led to severe damage. Although the storm was an unprecedented event, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions and warned the public about the approaching storm. Residents heeded the warnings and prepared for the storm by either evacuating or by riding it out in their homes. Catarina ended up destroying 1,500 homes and damaging around 40,000 others. Agricultural products were severely damaged: 85% of the banana crops and 40% of the rice crops were lost in the storm. Three people were confirmed to have perished in the storm and 185 others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to US$350 million (value in 2004).  Meteorological history  On March 12, a cold-core stationary upper-level trough became established offshore of southern Brazil. A disturbance formed within the trough on the March 19, and moved east-southeastward until March 22, when a ridge to its southeast kept it stationary. With exceptionally favorable upper level winds and slightly below average wind shear, as well as marginally warm, water temperatures from , it gradually developed tropical characteristics, resembling a subtropical storm by the March 24\\\\. Located east-southeast of Florian√≥polis, it headed slowly westward, and appeared to become a tropical storm on March 25. A compact storm, the cyclone continued westward while steadily intensifying. The structure of the storm continued to improve, and due to a definite eye feature showing on satellites, the storm was determined to have become a hurricane- equivalent cyclone on March 26. The storm attained wind speeds of ‚Äîequivalent to a low-end Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale‚Äîon March 26, making the cyclone the first hurricane-strength tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Around this time, a Brazilian newspaper had a headline \\"Furac√£o Catarina\\" (i.e. \\"hurricane [threatening the state of Santa] Catarina\\"). Partly because of this headline, the storm was unofficially named Catarina. Unusually favorable conditions persisted and Catarina continued to intensify, and Catarina was estimated to have peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of on March 28\\\\. Catarina continued to encounter favorable conditions and reached its peak intensity on early March 28, with a minimum central pressure of and estimated 1-minute sustained winds of , which made the storm the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. Wind gusts peaked at around . Soon afterward, the hurricane made landfall on the southern coast of Santa Catarina and northeastern Rio Grande do Sul, with winds up to overnight. After making landfall, Catarina rapidly weakened over land, in the normal manner of a tropical cyclone, dissipating later that day.  Naming  Hurricane Catarina as seen from the International Space Station on March 26, 2004 Brazilian meteorologists named the storm Catarina for its proximity to (and eventual landfall near) the state of Santa Catarina, although government forecasters initially denied that the storm, which clearly had an open eye and various other tropical morphologies, was a hurricane at all. More than a year after the storm made landfall, Brazilian meteorologists finally classified the storm as a tropical cyclone. North American forecasters, however surprised as they were, considered this storm a hurricane immediately upon reviewing the satellite-derived evidence. Since Catarina had a clear eyewall structure bounded by deep convective, dense central overcast, well-defined spiral outer bands and outflow structure, warm water temperatures of , little shear, a warm core low, overall tropical characteristics, and occurred in March (equivalent to September in the Northern Hemisphere, the peak of hurricane season), it was considered to be a hurricane by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in the United States. Though it is most commonly known as Catarina, all names for this storm are \\"unofficial,\\" in that no World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-affiliated meteorological agency that monitors hurricanes named it. (Tropical cyclone names are predetermined by an international committee of the WMO.) It has also been unofficially called \\"Aldon√ßa\\", and the advisory names for it were \\"01T-ALPHA\\" from the United Kingdom's Met Office, and \\"50L-NONAME\\" from the United States' National Hurricane Center, which keeps it well outside normal designation, which start at 01L for named storms and use 90L to 99L for invests.  Rare formation  Typically, tropical cyclones do not form in the South Atlantic Ocean, due to strong upper level shear, cool water temperatures, and the lack of a convergence zone of convection. Occasionally though, as seen in 1991 and early 2004, conditions can become slightly more favorable. For Catarina, it was a combination of climatic and atmospheric anomalies. Water temperatures on Catarina's path ranged from , slightly less than the temperature of a normal tropical cyclone, but sufficient for a storm of baroclinic origin. Catarina remains the only hurricane strength tropical cyclone ever observed in the South Atlantic Ocean (reliable continuous and relatively comprehensive records only began with the satellite era beginning about 1970). Other systems have been observed in this region; however, none have reached hurricane strength, and no eyes were seen on satellite imagery or radar. While Catarina formed in an unusual area, its relation to global warming or any other type of global climatic change is still up for debate. The attributed it to \\"climatic changes and atmospheric anomalies,\\" while other researchers have indicated that it could be the result of the Southern Annular Mode or other seasonal variations in weather within the Southern Hemisphere, again linked to global changes in climate. However, more research in the area is still needed to make a conclusion.  Impact  Hurricane Catarina at landfall NOAA satellite loop of Hurricane Catarina Like normal tropical cyclones, Catarina brought heavy flooding with it. Despite the uncertainty in the future of the storm, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the residents who lived along the coastline. A successful evacuation was executed for numerous residents along the coast, though some people decided to ride out the storm in their own homes. The storm damaged around 40,000 homes and destroyed 1,500; 40% of the rice crop were also lost. Total damages were estimated at $350 million (2004 USD). It also killed at least three and injured at least 75. At least 2,000 people were left homeless following the storm. At Passo de Torres, many shipyards were destroyed, as they were not designed to withstand the pressure differentials caused by Catarina's winds; widespread roof damage was reported at this municipality as well. Near the Mampituba River, a house was blown about upstream, literally landing in another state: it originally was built in the Torres municipality of Rio Grande do Sul, yet it ended up in Passo de Torres, within Santa Catarina. In rural areas, the corn, banana, and rice fields received the most damage, although rice farmers were able to partially recoup their losses, as they had harvested before Catarina made landfall. Overall, almost 36,000 residences were damaged as a result of Catarina's onslaught; of those, 993 collapsed completely. The commercial sector fared slightly better, as only 2,274 buildings were damaged and 472 collapsed. Finally, 397 public buildings were damaged and three were destroyed. These account for 26% of the total buildings in the region, which amounted to property damage of US$25.6 million (value in 2004). Four-fifths of the damaged houses had some sort of roof failure or collapse. Most of the damage was blamed on the low quality of the construction; brick residences typically lacked plaster, beams, or columns, for example. The areas affected the most were those inhabited by low-income families, usually with annual family salaries of less than US$400.

September/October 2011 Main characters *Craig Thompson: Craig is the main character, who is depicted from childhood to young adulthood. Craig is a talented artist and devout Christian. At a Baptist Christian winter camp he meets a girl from a similar background named Raina who becomes his first love. *Phil: Craig's younger brother. Like Craig, he likes to draw, and the first portion of the story details their childhood together, though they later drift apart. Their adventures are also recalled at least once in each chapter throughout the book. *Raina: Craig's first love, a fellow Christian whom Craig first meets at a church camp. Like Craig, her family is not well-off financially, and her parents' divorce causes her stress. She also takes care of her mentally disabled sister and brother. Although she believes in God, she does not believe as strongly as Craig does. *Craig's parents: Craig's parents are strict, devoutly religious Christians who are not very tolerant of liberal Christianity. *Raina's father: Raina's father is a man who is loyal to his own beliefs and is hoping to salvage his relationship with his wife. *Raina's mother: Raina's mother has no interest in repairing her relationship with her husband, and is trying to move on. Both she and her husband leave Raina to take care of her adopted siblings, as well as her niece. After being away from the home all day and upon returning, she frequented the medicine cabinet for some prescription drugs to retreat to her bedroom alone. *Laura and Ben: Raina's adopted sister and brother, both of whom are mentally disabled. Ben is a far more quiet and collected person, whereas Laura is far more energetic. *Julie and Dave: Raina's sister and brother in law. Synopsis Childhood scene in Blankets in which Craig and Phil find a pair of animal skulls. Blankets chronicles Craig's adolescence and young adulthood, his childhood relationship with his younger brother, and the conflicts he experiences regarding Christianity and his first love. Though written chronologically, Thompson uses flashbacks as a literary and artistic device in order to parallel young adult experience with past childhood experience. Major literary themes of the work include: first love, child and adult sexuality, spirituality, sibling relationships, and coming of age. Craig begins by describing his relationship with his brother during their childhood in Wisconsin. They have devoutly religious parents. Thompson also depicts a male babysitter sexually abusing both Craig and his younger brother, Phil. Craig suffers harassment from bullies at school and at church. Through his teen years, he continues to find it hard to fit in with his peers, but at Bible camp one winter, he comes to associate with a group of outcast teens which includes a girl named Raina, who develops an interest in Craig. The two become inseparable, and continue their relationship through letters and phone calls. They arrange to spend two weeks together at Raina's home in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Craig arrives and meets Raina‚Äôs family, which includes her two adopted siblings, Ben and Laura, her older biological sister Julie, and her parents, who are undergoing a divorce. Raina feels responsible for taking care of Ben and Laura, who are mentally handicapped, as well as Julie‚Äôs newborn daughter. Despite growing closer during the visit, the two return to their separate lives, but Raina eventually decides to break off the relationship. They maintain a friendship for a time, talking on the phone with diminishing frequency (and increasing inanity). Ultimately, Craig tells Raina that their friendship, too, is over. Craig then destroys everything Raina had ever given to him, and every memento of their relationship, except for the quilt she made. He stores it in the attic of his childhood home, and moves out to start his own life elsewhere. Craig comes to terms with religion and his spiritual identity while away from his family, and confides in his brother that he is no longer a Christian, but still believes in God and the teachings of Jesus. He returns to his childhood home after several years, seemingly a different person. Reception Craig Thompson sketches Raina in a copy of the book at a September 20, 2011 book signing at Midtown Comics in Manhattan. Blankets received considerable attention in the comics and mainstream book press; it was extremely well received and eventually won numerous awards (see below). Most critics considered it a milestone in the progress of the American graphic novel, not only in length but also in visual grace and technique. Critics have further hailed it as one of the best graphic novels in recent years, claiming that the book will be remembered for its superb execution a decade after publication. The Bloomsbury Review called it \\"a superb example of the art of cartooning: the blending of word and picture to achieve an effect that neither is capable of without the other.\\" Time stated that Thompson's work \\"has set new bars for the medium not just in length, but breadth\\" and listed it as #1 in its 2003 Best Comics of the Year list,Arnold, Andrew.

Another Pulitzer Prize-winning comic author, Jules Feiffer, wrote that Thompson's \\"expert blending of words and pictures and resonant silences makes for a transcendent kind of story-telling that grabs you as you read it and stays with you after you put it down\\". Alan Moore praised the book in interviews as \\"an incredibly heartwarming human document\\" adding that he found it \\"touching and engrossing\\", and publicly defended it when it was attacked as pornography (see below).COMICS, SEXUALITY, AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY Neil Gaiman wrote, \\"I thought it was moving, tender, beautifully drawn, painfully honest, and probably the most important graphic novel since Jimmy Corrigan\\". Thompson said that he believes Blankets was a success because he was \\"reacting against all of the over-the-top, explosive action genre [in alternative comics, and] I also didn‚Äôt want to do anything cynical and nihilistic, which is the standard for a lot of alternative comics.\\" Despite the praise heaped upon the book, it resulted in tension between Thompson and his parents for a couple of years after they read it. In October 2006, a resident of Marshall, Missouri, attempted to have Blankets and Fun Home by Alison Bechdel removed from the city's public library. Supporters of the books' removal characterized them as \\"pornography\\" and expressed concern that they would be read by children. Marshall Public Library Director Amy Crump defended the books as having been well-reviewed in \\"reputable, professional book review journals,\\" and characterized the removal attempt as a step towards \\"the slippery slope of censorship\\". On October 11, 2006, the library's board appointed a committee to create a materials selection policy, and removed Blankets and Fun Home from circulation until the new policy was approved. The committee \\"decided not to assign a prejudicial label or segregate [the books] by a prejudicial system\\", and presented a materials selection policy to the board. On March 14, 2007, the Marshall Public Library Board of Trustees voted to return both Blankets and Fun Home to the library's shelves. =Awards= * 2004 Harvey Award for Best Artist\\"2004 Harvey Award Winners\\" .

It is the capital of the Camag√ºey Province. It was founded as Santa Mar√≠a del Puerto del Pr√≠ncipe in 1514, by Spanish colonists on the northern coast and moved inland in 1528, to the site of a Taino village named Camag√ºey. It was one of the seven original settlements (villas) founded in Cuba by the Spanish. After Henry Morgan burned the city in the 17th century, it was redesigned like a maze so attackers would find it hard to move around inside the city. The symbol of the city of Camag√ºey is the clay pot or tinaj√≥n, used to capture rain water and keep it fresh. Camag√ºey is also the birthplace of Ignacio Agramonte (1841), an important figure of the Ten Years' War against Spain. A monument by Italian sculptor Salvatore Buemi, erected in the center of the area to Ignacio Agramonte, was unveiled by his wife in 1912. It is composed of an equestrian statue, reliefs in bronze that reveal fragments of the life of Agramonte, and a sculpture of a woman that symbolizes the motherland. In July 2008, the old town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History Camag√ºey was founded as Santa Mar√≠a del Puerto del Pr√≠ncipe in 1514, by Spanish colonists led by Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar at a location now known as Nuevitas on the northern coast. It was one of the seven original settlements (villas) founded in Cuba by the Spanish. The settlement was moved inland in 1528 to the site of a Ta√≠no village named Camag√ºey. Between 1747 and 1753 Luis de Unzaga, then Captain Governor of Puerto Principe, rehabilitated the town, which was very deteriorated in the War of Jenkins' Ear, and Unzaga rebuilt the church of La Merced Cazorla, Frank , G.

It was in 1898 when it received the current name of Camag√ºey, as a result of the Spain's independence. The indigenous name was already used to refer to the region \\"El Camag√ºey\\" in reference to the local chief ('Cacique') Camag√ºebax, who exercised his command between the T√≠nima and Hatibonico rivers and was approved on that date for both the city and the province that had been created in 1878 as a military region for the republic in arms. The new city was built with a confusing lay-out of winding alleys. There are many blind alleys and forked streets that lead to squares of different sizes. One explanation is that this was done by design, to make the city easier to defend from any raiders; by the same version, the reason that there is only one exit from the city was that should pirates ever return and succeed in entering the city, it would be possible for local inhabitants to entrap and kill them. However, locals dispute this reasoning as a myth, asserting that in truth the city developed without planning, and that winding streets developed out of everybody wanting to stay close to their local church (the city has 15 of them). Geography Located on a plain in the middle of its province, the municipality borders with Vertientes, Florida, Esmeralda, Sierra de Cubitas, Minas, Sibanic√∫ and Jimaguay√∫. Demographics In 2004, the municipality of Camag√ºey had a population of 324,921. With a total area of , it has a population density of . Culture The clay pots in Camag√ºey The symbol of the city of Camag√ºey is the clay pot or tinaj√≥n, used to capture rain water to be used later, keeping it fresh. Clay pots are everywhere, some as small as a hand, some large enough for two people to stand up in, either as monuments or for real use. A local legend is that if you drink water from a \\"tinajon\\", you will stay in Camag√ºey (\\"Quien tome agua del tinaj√≥n, en Camag√ºey se queda\\"), meaning that if you meet a Camag√ºayense girl, you will fall in love with her and never leave. The main secondary education institutions are the University of Camag√ºey and the Instituto Pedag√≥gico de Camag√ºey. In July 2008, the old town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Infrastructure ;Street layout The old city layout resembles a real maze, with narrow, short streets always turning in one direction or another. After Henry Morgan burned the city in the 17th century, it was designed like a maze so attackers would find it hard to move around inside the city. =Transport= Camag√ºey counts an important railway station on the main Havana-Santiago line with connections to minor lines. The station lies in the central \\"Avenida Van Horne\\", at the corner with \\"Avenida Finlay\\". The city is crossed by the Carretera Central highway and counts a beltway. The A1 motorway, that will link Havana to Guant√°namo, and partly built, is in project phase in the city area. ;Airports Camag√ºey has its own international airport, Ignacio Agramonte International Airport located in the north-eastern suburb. Most tourists going to or leaving the Beach of Santa Luc√≠a do so through this airport. Climate According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Camag√ºey has a tropical savanna climate, abbreviated \\"Aw\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Camag√ºey, Cuba Since Cuba is a hotspot for tropical cyclones, it has been affected many times, like in 1932, with the 1932 Cuba hurricane.  Sport  The local baseball club is Camag√ºey, nicknamed Alfareros, and its home ground is the Estadio C√°ndido Gonz√°lez. The association football club is FC Camag√ºey and its home ground is the Estadio Patricio Lumumba.

The size of the institution qualifies it as a \\"learning city\\". This center is homologous to others existing in the rest of the country's provinces. Students usually form close bonds and lasting friendships while at the institution, but family bonds sometimes suffer and \\"traditional\\" moral attitudes tend to shift as teenagers spend weeks away from their family. To be admitted into the IPVCE, students must take an entrance exam after completing the preparation of the Basic Secondary Education (7th to 9th grade). During the following three years they receive intensive preparation in order to gain acceptance to college. =Other high schools= What we know in United States as High Schools (9-12 grade), in Cuba is called Secundaria from (7-9 grade) and Pre-Universitario from (10-12 grade).

Notable residents Camag√ºey is the birthplace of professional boxer Luis Ortiz (1979). The statue of Ignacio Agramonte Camag√ºey is also the birthplace of Ignacio Agramonte (1841), an important figure of the Ten Years' War against Spain between 1868 and 1878. Agramonte drafted the first Cuban Constitution in 1869, and later, as a Major General, formed the fearsome Camag√ºey cavalry corps that had the Spaniards on the run. He died in combat on May 11, 1873; his body was burned in the city because the Spanish feared the rebels would attack the city to recover his body. The outline of Ignacio Agramonte's horseback statue in the Park that bears his name is a symbol of Camag√ºey. It was set there in 1911, uncovered by his widow, Amalia Simoni. Artists include Jos√© Iraola, a contemporary painter who was born in Camag√ºey, on September 19, 1961, and sculptor Roberto Estopi√±√°n, born in Camag√ºey, in 1921. Poets and writers include Br√≠gida Ag√ºero y Ag√ºero (1837-1866) and Domitila Garc√≠a Dom√©nico de Coronado (1847-1938). A street in the city has been named for Ag√ºero.

Father Jos√© Olallo Vald√©s worked there, and was beatified in the city on November 29, 2008. Olympic champion amateur boxer at 75 kg in Sydney 2000 was Jorge Guti√©rrez Espinosa, born on 18 September 1975 in Camag√ºey. It is the birthplace of the Cuban writer Severo Sarduy, a member of the European intellectual community that consolidated in the 1960s behind Tel Quel, a journal of critical thought. Sarduy, censored in Cuba throughout the 20th century, lived in Paris as an exile from 1960 until his death in 1993. He holds the position within literary history of having reformulated the transatlantic reconfigurations of the Hispanic Baroque aesthetic under the term \\"Neobaroque\\".

He was commissioned in the United States Volunteers in 1898 and served in the Quartermaster Corps during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He gained notice for his work in logistics and animal husbandry, and received a commission in the regular United States Army in 1901.

Butt attended various local schools while growing up, including Summerville Academy.\\"Archibald W. Butt\\", in Butt, Both Sides of the Shield, p. xiii. Butt's father died when he was 14 years old, and Butt went to work to support his mother, sister, and younger brother. Pamela Butt wished for her son to enter the clergy. With the financial help of the Reverend Edwin G. Weed (who later became the Episcopal Bishop of Florida), Butt attended the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. His mother worked as a librarian at the university, where she lived rent-free in an apartment in the library.Abbott, p. xiii. While in college, he became interested in journalism and eventually was named editor of the college newspaper. Butt became acquainted with John Breckinridge Castleman, a former CSA major and guerrilla fighter during the American Civil War and who was, by 1883, Adjutant General of the Kentucky Militia. He joined the Delta Tau Delta fraternity,Macfarland, p. 67. and graduated in 1888.\\"Butt, Archibald Willingham DeGraffenreid\\", in The Encyclopedia of Louisville, p. 150. After taking graduate level courses in Greek and Latin, Butt traveled to Louisville, Kentucky, to meet with Castleman. While in that city, he met Henry Watterson, founder of the Louisville Courier-Journal. Watterson hired him as a reporter, and Butt remained in Louisville for three years. Butt left the Courier-Journal and worked for the Macon Telegraph for a year before moving to Washington, D.C.\\"Archibald W. Butt\\", in Butt, Both Sides of the Shield, p. xiv.

Although Butt's literary career was taking off, his family's long involvement with the military and his desire to represent his family in the army led him to enlist.\\"Archibald W.

But he found the price of feed and stables so high and the quarters for the animals so poor that he disobeyed orders and continued on to the Philippines.

Butt remained in the Philippines until 1904, writing numerous treatises on the care of animals in the tropics and on military transportation and logistics. His reports won him significant praise by military officials.\\"Archibald W. Butt\\", in Butt, Both Sides of the Shield, pp. xv‚Äìxvi. On June 30, 1901, Butt was discharged from the Volunteers and received a commission as a captain in the Regular Army retroactive to February 2, 1901.Butt's personal papers and memoirs claim the commission was made on January 2, 1900, which was the date of his commission in the Volunteers. But the commission was recommended by William Howard Taft, who was chairman of the Second Philippine Commission‚Äîthe body which was organizing a civilian government in the Philippines in the wake of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the first battles of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Taft made the recommendation that Butt receive a commission in the Army to Secretary of War Elihu Root on January 7, 1901. In this matter it is important distinguish between a commission in the United States Volunteers and the Regular Army. See: Bromley, p. 52. Butt's social activities continued while he was in the Philippines. He was secretary of the Army and Navy Club, and had a major role in founding the Military Order of the Carabao (a tongue- in-cheek spoof of military fraternal organizations that still exists ).Roth, p. 256. In 1904, Butt was ordered to return to Washington, D.C., where he was appointed depot quartermaster. He was the lowest-ranking officer ever to hold this important position within the Quartermaster Corps.Bromley, p. 52. In 1906, when a revolution against Tom√°s Estrada Palma broke out in Cuba, Butt was hurriedly assigned to lead U.S. Army logistical operations there. On just two days' notice, he established a well-organized supply depot. He was named Depot Quartermaster in Havana.\\"Archibald W. Butt\\", in Butt, Both Sides of the Shield, p. xvii. Service to two presidents Butt (left, in uniform) on the White House portico with Robert Baden-Powell, President Taft, and British ambassador Lord Bryce in February 1912. Butt was recalled to Washington in March 1908. President Theodore Roosevelt asked him to serve as his military aide in April 1908Gould, p. 208.‚Äîjust a month after Butt's return to the United States. There were several reasons why Roosevelt chose Butt. Among them were that Roosevelt had become acquainted with Butt's organizational skills in the Philippines and was impressed by his hard work and thoughtfulness. The other was that Taft recommended Butt, whom he knew well from their time together overseas. Butt became one of Roosevelt's closest companions.Morris, p. 529. Although Butt was stout, he and Roosevelt were constantly going climbing, hiking, horseback riding, running, swimming, and playing tennis.Watterson, p. 388. Butt also quickly organized the chaotic White House receptions, transforming them from exhausting, hours-long events fraught with social missteps into efficient, orderly events.Davenport-Hines, Richard. \\"The History Page: Unsinkable Love.\\" The Daily. March 20, 2012. Accessed 2012-05-18. When William Howard Taft became president in March 1909, he asked Butt to stay on as military aide. Butt continued to serve as a social functionary for Taft, but he also proved to have strong negotiating skills and a good head for numbers, which enabled him to become Taft's de facto chief negotiator on federal budget issues. Butt accompanied President Taft when he threw out the first ball at the first home game of Major League Baseball's Washington Senators in 1910 and 1911.\\"Taft Tosses Ball.\\" Washington Post April 15, 1910; \\"Nationals Win, 8 to 5, as 16,000 Cheer Them.\\" Washington Post.

By 1912, Taft's first term was coming to an end. Roosevelt, who had fallen out with Taft, was known to be considering a run for president against him. Close to both men and fiercely loyal, Butt began to suffer from depression and exhaustion.Abbott, pp. xi‚Äìx. Butt's housemate and friend Francis Davis Millet (himself one of Taft's circle) asked Taft to give him a leave of absence to recuperate before the presidential primaries began. Taft agreed and ordered Butt to go on vacation.Garrison, p. 89. Butt was on no official business, but anti-Catholic newspapers and politicians accused Butt of being on a secret mission to win the support of Pope Pius X in the upcoming election. Butt did intend to meet with Pius, and he carried with him a personal letter from Taft. But the letter merely thanked the pope for elevating three Americans to the rank of cardinal, and asked what the social protocol was for greeting them at functions.Bromley, p. 326. Sinking of the Titanic Butt left on a six-week vacation in Europe on March 1, 1912, accompanied by Millet.\\"Major Butt on Sick Leave.\\" New York Times. March 1, 1912. Butt booked passage on the RMS Titanic to return to the United States. He boarded the ship at Southampton, in England on April 10, 1912; Millet boarded the ship at Cherbourg, France, later that same day. Butt was playing cards on the night of April 14 in the first-class smoking room when the Titanic struck an iceberg.Lynch, p. 84. The ship sank two and a half hours later, with a loss of over 1,500 lives. Butt's actions while the ship sank are largely unverified, but many accounts of a sensationalist nature were published by newspapers immediately after the disaster. One account had the ship's captain, Edward J. Smith, telling Butt that the ship was doomed, after which Butt began to act like a ship's officer and supervised the loading and lowering of lifeboats.Caplan, pp. 55‚Äì57. The New York Times also claimed that Butt herded women and children into lifeboats.\\"The Tragedy of the Titanic‚ÄîA Complete Story.\\" New York Times. April 28, 1912. Another account said that Butt, a gun in his hand, prevented panicked male passengers from storming the lifeboats.Caplan, p. 55. Yet another version of events said Butt yanked a man out of one of the lifeboats so that a woman could board. In this story, Butt declared, \\"Sorry, women will be attended to first or I'll break every damned bone in your body!\\" One account tells of Butt preventing desperate steerage passengers from breaking into the first class areas in an attempt to escape the sinking ship. Walter Lord's book A Night to Remember disagrees with claims that Butt acted like an officer. Lord says Butt most likely observed the ship's evacuation quietly.Lord, p. 78. Many newspapers repeated a story allegedly told by Marie Young. This tale says that Butt helped her into Lifeboat No. 8, tucked a blanket about her, and said, \\"Goodbye, Miss Young. Luck is with you. Will you kindly remember me to all the folks back home?\\" Young later wrote to President Taft denying she ever told such a story.Bromley, pp. 329‚Äì330. Clarence Moore\\" Even Butt's final moments remain in dispute. Dr. Washington Dodge says he saw John Jacob Astor and Butt standing near the bridge as the ship went down.Mowbray, p. 113. Dodge's account is highly unlikely, as his lifeboat was more than away from the ship at the time it sank.Barczewski, p. 60. Other eyewitnesses say they saw him standing calmly on deckSpignesi, p. 42. or standing side by side with Astor waving goodbye.Hines, p. 145. Several accounts had Butt returning to the smoking room, where he stood quietly or resumed his card game.Barczewski, p. 27. But these accounts have been disputed by author John Maxtone- Graham.Maxtone-Graham notes that if the eyewitnesses had been where they claimed, they would have had to travel aft and down a deck to loop through the smoking room, a highly improbable journey if they were seeking to abandon ship. See: Maxtone-Graham, p. 76. Butt died in Titanic's sinking; his body was never recovered.Schemmel, p. 148. Funerals, memorials, and papers On May 2, 1912, a memorial service was held in the Butt family home with 1,500 mourners, including President Taft, attending. Taft spoke at the service, saying:Quote in Mowbray, p. xvi. At a second ceremony, held in Washington, D.C., on May 5, Taft broke down and wept, bringing his eulogy to an abrupt end.\\"Taft in Tears as He Lauds Major Butt.\\" New York Times.

Sculptor Jorgen Dreyer was awarded a commission to create a sculpture to commemorate Butt. The commissioned piece, which Dreyer completed on 15 June 1912, was a bust of Butt situated on a base representing a ship on the ocean. The work was entitled \\"The Message\\".

These letters are a key source of information on the more private events of these two presidencies and provide insights into the respective characters of Roosevelt and Taft.Gould, p. 224. Donald E. Wilkes Jr., professor of law at the University of Georgia School of Law, has concluded, \\"All definitive biographies of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft necessarily rely on information in Archie's letters.\\"Wilkes, Jr., Donald E. \\"On the Titanic: Archie Butt\\" The Athens Observer April 28-May 4, 1994, p. 6.] Accessed 2012-05-18. These letters (which overlap somewhat) have been published twice. The first collection, The Letters of Archie Butt, Personal Aide to President Roosevelt, was issued in 1924.O'Toole, p. 408. A second set of letters, Taft and Roosevelt: The Intimate Letters of Archie Butt, Military Aide, was published in two volumes in 1930 after Taft's death.Graff, p. 363.

They were known for throwing spartan but large parties that were attended by members of Congress, justices of the Supreme Court, and President Taft himself. A wide range of reasons were given why Butt never seemed interested in women. Chief among these was that Butt loved his own mother so much that there was little room for anyone else. Even Taft thought this explanation was true.Taft, p. viii. At the time of Butt's death, rumors swirled that he was about to lose his lifelong bachelor status. News accounts said he had a teenage mistress who either was carrying their unborn child or who had already given birth to a baby, or that Butt was engaged to a Colorado woman. None of these rumors were true.Anthony, p. 484.\\"Archibald C. Butt Was to Have Been Married This Fall.\\" Denver Post April 18, 1912. Some speculation exists that Butt was a homosexual. Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony has written that Taft's explanation only \\"vaguely addressed\\" the real reason Butt failed to marry.Anthony, p. 484. Davenport-Hines, however, believes Butt and Millet were gay lovers. He wrote in 2012: Historian James Gifford tentatively agrees. He points out that there is clear documentary evidence that Millet had at least one homosexual affair previously in his life (with the American writer Charles Warren Stoddard).Prior, Will. \\"Historian Says Famous Titanic Passengers Were Gay.\\" Gay Star News.

Memberships In 1911 Butt became a member of the Georgia Society of the Cincinnati by right of his descent from his great-grandfather Lieutenant Robert Moseley, a veteran of the American Revolution.Thomas, 1929, p. 37. Butt was also a member of the Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C., the District of Columbia Society of Colonial Wars (number 3541), the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution (national number 16,412) and was a founding member of the Military Order of the Carabao.General Society of Colonial Wars, p. 108; National Sons of the American Revolution, p. 16. Military awards *Philippine Campaign Medal *Army of Cuban Pacification Medal In fiction Butt appears and plays a significant role in Jack Finney's time travel novel, From Time to Time. In this novel, Butt is sent to Europe by President Taft and former President Roosevelt in an effort to stave off World War I. In Europe, he apparently gets the necessary assurances to make a European war impossible. However, even when informed of the ship's approaching sinking by the time traveling protagonist, he refuses to save himself and his mission when women and children will perish. His mission fails with his death. James Walker's 1998 novel, Murder on the Titanic, includes Butt as a minor character. Michael Bockman's 2012 novel, The Titanic Plan, features Archibald Butt as the major character in a historical-based novel involving leading industrialists and banking magnates of the day, and their plan to establish an illegal national commerce monopoly that would yield massive power and political influence to a few super-wealthy men. Butt appears in the 2014 novel The Great Abraham Lincoln Pocket Watch Conspiracy by Jacopo della Quercia, where he is depicted as President Taft's closest friend and companion aboard a fictitious presidential dirigible \\"Airship One\\", which Butt pilots. The book uses period newspaper articles to report Butt's promotion from captain to major and even makes use of his letters to his sister Clara. Butt plays a major role in the story. His death is depicted as a climactic showdown between the United States and King Leopold II of Belgium aboard the Titanic. References Bibliography * Butt, Archibald W.

The facility was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981, with a decrease in its boundaries in 1986. The facility was closed in 1997 and demolished in 2000. History In 1873, to alleviate the overcrowding at the Kalamazoo psychiatric hospital, the Michigan state legislature appropriated $400,000 for the construction of a second hospital in eastern Michigan. Cities in the area were requested to bid for the project, and Pontiac won out over Detroit and other cities. The architect for the original main hospital was Elijah E. Myers, who also served as the architect for the current Michigan State Capitol in Lansing. The asylum opened its doors five years later, on August 1, 1878, and began treating 222 patients. The original superintendent, Henry Mills Hurd, introduced multiple innovations in psychiatric care, including discouraging restraints, occupational therapy, and recreational activities. Both the campus size and number of patients slowly grew, as the hospital was repeatedly enlarged between 1882 and 1895 (also designed by Myers), with more additions in 1906, 1914, and 1938. In 1911, the hospital changed its name to Pontiac State Hospital. During the 1950s, the hospital experienced its peak of approximately 3,100 residing patients. The facility was renamed the Clinton Valley Center in 1973, and by the later 1970s the number of patients had declined to around 800. Due to a decreasing number of patients, the facility was closed in 1997 by the State of Michigan with only 200 patients. The facility was demolished in 2000; a subdivision now stands on the site of the old hospital. Description Eastern Michigan Asylum, c. 1876 The campus of the Clinton Valley Center contained 44 structures, many of which were extensions of the original 1878 hospital. The 1878 structure was a 3-1/2 story red brick structure with a center building for offices and staff, and two wings for male and female patients. The building had a steeply pitched slate roof with multiple towers, and wood and metal cornices. The building resembled a typical Kirkbride model. The 1882 additions were designed by Charles Anderson to match the original construction. The 1906 and 1914 additions were brick hipped-roof structures, and the 1938 construction added a Tudor designed building onto the front of the structure. Apart from the main hospital, other structures on the campus included the Vinton Building (1893), the Sawyer Building (1917), the Italian Renaissance chapel (1907) designed by the Detroit firm of Smith, Hinchman and Grylls.

Early life and ministry Kucera was born in a Czech family in Chicago, Illinois, on May 7, 1923, and given the name William. His parents were Joseph F. and Lillian (Petrzelka) Kucera. Kucera was educated at St. Procopius College (now known as Benedictine University) in Lisle, Illinois. He took the religious name of Daniel when he professed religious vows June 16, 1944, at St. Procopius Abbey in the Order of Saint Benedict. On May 26, 1949, he was ordained a priest. Kucera earned a doctorate in education from The Catholic University of America in 1954. His background in education has led Vatican officials ‚Äî including the Pope ‚Äî to ask his advice on educational matters. He served in various administrative positions at St. Procopius College until he was named the college's president. On July 8, 1964, he was elected Abbot of St. Procopius Abbey and received his abbatial blessing on August 19, 1964. He served as abbot until June 1, 1971, when he resigned to become the college's president again. On June 6, 1977, Pope Paul VI named Kucera Titular Bishop of Natchesium and Auxiliary Bishop of Joliet. He was consecrated by Bishop Romeo Roy Blanchette of Joliet. Bishops Andrew Grutka of Gary and Raymond Vonesh, auxiliary bishop of Joliet, served as primary co-consecrators. Bishop of Salina On March 5, 1980, Pope John Paul II appointed Kucera as the eighth bishop of Salina, in the state of Kansas. He was formally installed in Sacred Heart Cathedral on May 7, 1980, by Archbishop Ignatius J. Strecker of Kansas City in Kansas. During his three years as bishop of the diocese the Diocesan Office of Planning, the Bishop's Council for Catholic Education and the Office of Youth Ministries were established. The diocese hired a business manager, and the chancery and other administrative offices of the diocese were moved to a larger building downtown. Marymount College in Salina became a diocesan institution after the Sisters of St. Joseph of Concordia decided they were no longer able to continue ownership. The college closed in 1989. Archbishop of Dubuque On December 20, 1983, Pope John Paul II appointed Kucera as the tenth bishop and eighth archbishop of Dubuque. He was installed as archbishop on February 23, 1984, at the Five Flags Civic Center in Dubuque. One of the first decisions he made was to sell the old episcopal residence and move to a more modest house in Dubuque. Kucera set about reorganizing the archdiocese. This was accomplished by reorganizing or creating archdiocesan boards, and established the first Archbishop's Cabinet to coordinate the running of the archdiocese. The archdiocese was divided into three regions: Dubuque, Cedar Rapids and Waterloo with a bishop in each region. The number of deaneries were reduced from 16 to 14. Kucera appointed a woman religious chancellor, and two lay people were named to archdiocesan offices. He also had revised guidelines for the Sacrament of Confirmation published in 1986. On November 30, 1986, Kucera issued a proclamation announcing the 150th anniversary of the archdiocese's founding. Various celebrations were held throughout the following year including a large scale liturgy at the Five Flags Center celebrated by Archbishop Pio Laghi, the Papal Pro-Nuncio to the United States. He also approved a controversial renovation of St. Raphael's Cathedral. In 1994, he requested the appointment of a coadjutor. Bishop Jerome Hanus of Saint Cloud was assigned as Coadjutor Archbishop of Dubuque. On October 16, 1995, Pope John Paul II accepted Kucera's resignation, and he was named archbishop emeritus. Later life and death By 2013 Kucera had moved back to Dubuque after living in Aurora, Colorado, for a number of years. On May 31, 2017, church officials confirmed that Kucera had died at Stonehill Care Center in Dubuque on May 30, 2017, at the age of 94. His funeral was held at St. Raphael's Cathedral in Dubuque, and he was interred in the cemetery of St. Procopius Abbey in Lisle.

Early life Born in Nadiad, in the Indian state of Gujarat, Vithalbhai Jhaverbhai Patel was the third of five Patel brothers, two years elder to Vallabhbhai Patel, raised in the village of Karamsad. According to Gordhanbhai Patel, a mistake on Vitalbhai's birthdate has crept into many modern accounts. His birthdate is clearly stated as 27 September 1873 on his last passport but the confusion arose from obituary notices after his death listing it incorrectly as 18 February 1871. Based on that, he is only two years elder to his younger brother Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.Patel, p. 3 He was son of Jhaverbhai and Ladbai Patel, who were both devout followers of the Swaminarayan sect of Vaisnava Hinduism, a sect which emphasizes the purity of personal life as essential to the life of devotion. The rare idealism the religion impressed on his parents likely had a significant impact on the minds of Vithalbhai and his renowned brother Vallabhai Patel. Vithalbhai educated himself in Nadiad and in Bombay, and worked as a pleader (a junior lawyer) in the courts of Godhra and Borsad. At a very young age, he was married to a girl from another village, Diwaliba.Vithalbhai Patel. sardarpateltrust.org His younger brother, Vallabhbhai Patel, had similarly studied by himself and worked as a pleader. Studying in England was a dream for both men. Vallabhbhai had saved enough money and ordered his passport and travel tickets, when the postman delivered them to Vithalbhai, it having been addressed to a Mr. V.J. Patel, Pleader. Vithalbhai insisted on traveling on those documents actually meant for Vallabhbhai, pointing out that it would be socially criticized that an older brother followed the lead of the younger. Respecting his brother despite the obvious cruelty of fate on his own hard work, Vallabhbhai allowed him to proceed to England, and even paid for his stay. Vithalbhai entered the Middle Temple Inn in London, and completed the 36-month course in 30, emerging at the top of his class. Returning to Gujarat in 1913, Vithalbhai became an important barrister in the courts of Bombay and Ahmedabad. However, his wife died in 1915, and he remained a widower. Political career Although never truly accepting the philosophy and leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, Patel joined the Congress and the struggle for freedom. He had no regional base of support, yet he was an influential leader who expanded the struggle through fiery speeches and articles published. When Mahatma Gandhi aborted the struggle in 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, Patel left the Congress to form the Swaraj Party with Chittaranjan Das and Motilal Nehru, which would seek to foil the Raj by sabotaging the government after gaining entry in the councils. The Swaraj Party became the largest single party in the Central Legislature, and in most provincial legislative assemblies. Vithalbhai Patel himself was elected President (the equivalent of Speaker) of India's Central Legislative Assembly, and helped put in place many legislative procedures that still exist today. Patel and others were important voices who rebelled against the leadership of Gandhi when the nation anguished over the abortion of the Non- Cooperation Movement Patel grew popular and respected by his oratorical and witty mastery and belittling of the Raj's officials, winning many a battle of wit. In 1914, Vithalbhai played a prominent role in two bills on the Bombay provincial legislative council, \\"the Bombay District Municipal Act Amendment Bill\\" and \\"The Town Planning Bill\\" in 1914.Patel, p. 87 His most well known proposal for which he received praise was for the extension of primary education to municipal districts in the Bombay presidency outside of the city of Bombay in 1917. After a long battle, the bill was passed after several amendments and modifications.Patel, p. 146 Throughout his time on the legislative council, he passed and fought for several bills and amendments on medical practice. In a 1912 amendment to the Bombay medical act, he sought to register doctors for disciplinary action for malpractice. This amendment did not include ayurvedic physicians.Patel, pp. 149‚Äì152 In 1923 he was elected to the Central Legislative Assembly, a chamber of elected and appointed Indian and British representatives with limited legislative powers, and in 1925 became the Assembly's president, or speaker. As the President of the Assembly, Patel laid down the practices and procedures for the business of the Assembly. In 1928, he created a separate office for the Assembly, independent of the administration of the Government of India. He established the convention of neutrality of the President in debates, except to use a casting vote in favour of the status quo.Ajita Ranjan Mukherjea (1983) Parliamentary Procedure in India.

The Mayors of important cities such as New York, Boston, Worcester, Ann Arbor, Chicago, San Francisco and Sacramento officially received him. He was also welcomed officially by the Governors of states like Pennsylvania and Maryland. He also addressed each of the two houses of California's legislature for half an hour. While Vithalbhai was in London, the relationship between the British Empire and Ireland began to deteriorate. The outlaw Eamon De Valera came into power and refused to pay the annuity. The British cabinet was interested in devising ways to protect Ireland from slipping out of British hands. De Valera wanted Vithalbhai to act as an arbitrator between the British Empire and Ireland in the dispute on the Irish Question. Patel's health worsened in Europe. As his last political act, Patel signed a statement written by Bose which proclaimed Gandhi as a failed leader and called for a militant form of non-cooperation. On his deathbed he left a will of sorts, bequeathing three-quarters of his money to Bose to use in promoting India‚Äôs cause in other countries. When Vallabhbhai Patel saw a copy of the letter in which his brother had left a majority of his estate to Bose, he asked a series of questions: Why was the letter not attested by a doctor? Had the original paper been preserved? Why were the witnesses to that letter all men from Bengal and none of the many other veteran freedom activists and supporters of the Congress who had been present at Geneva where Vithalbhai had died? Patel may even have doubted the veracity of the signature on the document. The case went to court and after a legal battle that lasted more than a year, the courts judged that Vithalbhai‚Äôs estate could only be inherited by his legal heirs, that is, his family. Patel promptly handed the money over to the Vithalbhai Memorial Trust Vitthalbhai died in Geneva, Switzerland, on 22 October 1933. His body was embalmbed in Geneva and transported to Bombay on S. S Narkunda. and was cremated in Bombay on 10 November in front of a crowd of over 3 lakh people.

Just as in Lamport timestamps, interprocess messages contain the state of the sending process's logical clock. A vector clock of a system of N processes is an array/vector of N logical clocks, one clock per process; a local \\"smallest possible values\\" copy of the global clock-array is kept in each process, with the following rules for clock updates: Example of a system of vector clocks. Events in the blue region are the causes leading to event B4, whereas those in the red region are the effects of event B5 * Initially all clocks are zero. * Each time a process experiences an internal event, it increments its own logical clock in the vector by one. * Each time a process sends a message, it increments its own logical clock in the vector by one (as in the bullet above, but not twice for the same event) and then sends a copy of its own vector. * Each time a process receives a message, it increments its own logical clock in the vector by one and updates each element in its vector by taking the maximum of the value in its own vector clock and the value in the vector in the received message (for every element). History Without using the specific name \\"vector clock\\", the concept of a vector clock was first mentionedThe reference to this paper was discovered by Prof Lindsey Kuper and described in lecture 23 of her YouTube video lecture series on Distributed Systems in a 1986 paper by Rivka Ladin and Barbara Liskov where they use the term \\"multipart timestamp\\". To quote from page 31 of the Liskov/Ladin paper: > We solve this problem by using _multipart timestamps_ , where there is one > part for each replica. Thus, if there are n replicas, a timestamp t is \`t = > \` where each part is a positive integer. Since there will typically be a > small number of replicas (e.g., 3 to 7), using such a timestamp is > practical. The term \\"vector clock\\" was first used independently by Colin Fidge and Friedemann Mattern in 1988. Partial ordering property Vector clocks allow for the partial causal ordering of events. Defining the following: * VC(x) denotes the vector clock of event x, and VC(x)_z denotes the component of that clock for process z. * VC(x) < VC(y) \\\\iff \\\\forall z [VC(x)_z \\\\le VC(y)_z] \\\\land \\\\exists z' [ VC(x)_{z'} < VC(y)_{z'} ] ** In English: VC(x) is less than VC(y), if and only if VC(x)_z is less than or equal to VC(y)_z for all process indices z, and at least one of those relationships is strictly smaller (that is, VC(x)_{z'} < VC(y)_{z'}). * x \\\\to y\\\\; denotes that event x happened before event y. It is defined as: if x \\\\to y\\\\;, then VC(x) < VC(y) Properties: * Antisymmetry: if VC(a) < VC(b), then ¬¨(VC(b) < VC(a)) * Transitivity: if VC(a) < VC(b) and VC(b) < VC(c), then VC(a) < VC(c) or if a \\\\to b\\\\; and b \\\\to c\\\\;, then a \\\\to c\\\\; Relation with other orders: * Let RT(x) be the real time when event x occurs. If VC(a) < VC(b), then RT(a) < RT(b) * Let C(x) be the Lamport timestamp of event x. If VC(a) < VC(b), then C(a) < C(b) Other mechanisms * In 1999, Torres-Rojas and Ahamad developed Plausible Clocks, a mechanism that takes less space than vector clocks but that, in some cases, will totally order events that are causally concurrent. * In 2008, Almeida et al. introduced Interval Tree Clocks. This mechanism generalizes Vector Clocks and allows operation in dynamic environments when the identities and number of processes in the computation is not known in advance. * In 2019, Lum Ramabaja developed Bloom Clocks, a probabilistic data structure whose space complexity does not depend on the number of nodes in a system. If two clocks are not comparable, the bloom clock can always deduce it, i.e. false negatives are not possible. If two clocks are comparable, the bloom clock can calculate the confidence of that statement, i.e. it can compute the false positive rate between comparable pairs of clocks.

Eastern Passage has historically been tied to the fishing industry. Its waterfront has several small wharves and piers. The construction of CFB Shearwater, a military air base, at the northern boundary of the community during World War I, and the construction of the Imperial Oil (later Esso), Texaco (later Ultramar) oil refineries, the Volvo Halifax Assembly plant and automobile import/export facility following World War II redefined the local economy. New highway connections have resulted in the majority of area residents commuting to Downtown Halifax or Dartmouth. Geography Located at the southeastern edge of Halifax Harbour, fronting the Atlantic Ocean, Eastern Passage derives its name from the narrow strait separating the mainland from McNabs Island and Lawlor Island, both of which lie several hundred metres west of the community. This \\"Eastern Passage\\" into the harbour is not the main shipping channel due to its shallow depths; the main shipping channel lies west of McNabs Island. The Eastern Passage is largely used by small recreational boats and fishing vessels during inclement weather as the island affords shelter from prevailing winds. History Prior to the European settlers, Eastern Passage was a season home to the Mi'kmaq for thousands of years. Europeans began seasonal use of the channel starting about 1712 while the Mi'kmaq shifted to McNab's island. The Eastern Passage area was granted to ranger Joseph Gorham, but he did not settle the passage and the land was regranted in 1798 to Jacob Horn, the first recorded settler who was soon followed by other families.Alfreda Withrow, One City, Many Communities, Nimbus Publishing, 1999, pp. 21‚Äì23. The first European settlers who moved there were mainly German, French, Irish and English. These ethnic groups continue to make up a large portion of the population of Eastern Passage. Fort Clarence (formerly the Eastern Battery), a large gun battery was constructed beside Eastern Passage in 1754 at the beginning of the French and Indian War. Built to defend the harbour, the battery provided a cross fire with batteries on Georges Island and McNabs Island. In the late 1790s a Martello Tower was built at each of the three sites. During the American Civil War, The iron Confederate naval cruiser Tallahassee sailed into Halifax Harbour on August 18, 1864 to take on bunker coal and water and then used the Eastern Passage channel to escape, for it was believed that Union naval forces were waiting at the main harbour entrance. An American naval air station was constructed at Eastern Passage during World War I to patrol against German submarines. It was taken over by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1920s and became a large air base during World War II. In the 1920s and 1930s, a number of Eastern Passage residents from the Hartlan and Henneberry families proved important sources of Canadian folk songs and stories to Nova Scotia folklorist Helen Creighton. Serious reductions to the CFB Shearwater base in the 1990s and the shutdown of the Ultramar Refinery challenged the economy of Eastern Passage in the 1990s. One response was the redevelopment of the small craft harbour, long known as \\"the Crick\\" or \\"the cove\\" but rechristened in 1996 as \\"Fisherman's Cove\\", a tourist attraction which combines a working fishing harbour with gift shops and restaurants. In 1996 Fishermans Cove opened as a tourist attraction. The attraction had things such as shops and restaurants. In the summer of 2003, the fourth season of Trailer Park Boys was filmed in Eastern Passage. It was the last season of the show filmed in a privately held park.

A large serviced beach (MacDonald Beach) is located between Eastern Passage and Cole Harbour. There is also a smaller beach located down the road from MacDonald Beach. =Youth sports= Eastern Passage hosts a variety of youth sport programs, including soccer, basketball, baseball, and softball. Eastern Passage Soccer is organized by Soccer Nova Scotia and features both mini and youth leagues. Mini soccer includes Under-6, U-8 and U-10 teams, which are composed of both boys and girls. Youth soccer is divided by gender; it includes U-12, U-14, U-16 and U-18 teams. Registration for soccer starts in February and is open until June for both mini and youth leagues, and the soccer season ends in August. Towards the end 2016 Eastern Passage Soccer and Cole Harbour Soccer merged to form CHEP. 2017 commenced and finished votes on an even bigger merge, including Dartmouth United, Dartmouth FC, and the previously merged Cole Harbour and Eastern Passage soccer clubs. It was ultimately decided all 4 clubs would conjoin to create United DFC. Eastern Passage Soccer has hosted the Dartmouth region‚Äôs year-end mini festival, which is called Soccer By The Sea, for years. Since the merge of the 4 clubs, the newly formed United DFC hosts the beloved year-end event. The tournament celebrated its 19th year in 2010, and has seen well over 1500 players over the two-and-a-half-day event.

The film stars Russell Crowe, Daniel Pollock, Jacqueline McKenzie and Tony Lee. The film tells the story of the exploits and downfall of a neo-Nazi group in blue-collar suburban Melbourne. The film was released on 12 November 1992. Plot A gang of violent young neo-Nazi skinheads from Footscray, Victoria, Australia attack three Vietnamese Australian teenagers in a tunnel at Footscray Station, brutally beating two of them. The gang is led by Hando, a violent, reckless, and unpredictable psychopath with strong white nationalist beliefs and homicidal tendencies, with his friend and second-in-command, the quiet, reserved, but similarly violent Davey. At their local pub, Hando and Davey meet Gabrielle, a drug addict who suffers from random seizures, the day after her sexually abusive, affluent father Martin has her junkie boyfriend arrested. Gabrielle begins a romantic relationship with Hando, which, despite a strong start, quickly becomes dysfunctional as he becomes increasingly abusive towards her. After the gang vandalizes a shopping mall, friends of the gang visit from Canberra, one of whom has joined the Royal Australian Navy. A party at the warehouse follows. The next day two boys go to the pub, which has just been sold to a Vietnamese businessman by the owner. Upon seeing the new owner and his sons, they inform Hando, who arrives with his gang, and they savagely beat two of the new owner's sons, while the third son escapes and calls for help. Fed up with the gang's antagonism and violence, a large mob of armed and angry Vietnamese men, led by Tiger, arrive and descend upon the skinheads. The Vietnamese outnumber the skinheads by droves, and in the ensuing brawl and chase, several skinheads are beaten by the angry mob, among them Magoo, Luke, Champ, and Brent. The rest of the gang is chased back to their rented warehouse, from which they narrowly escape as the Vietnamese mob breaks in and ransacks the building before burning it down. The skinheads soon find a new base at a nearby warehouse, after evicting a pair of squatters, and plan retaliation against the Vietnamese. When the gang agrees to acquire firearms, two female friends of the gang depart in disgust. Gabrielle suggests the gang burgle her father's mansion for the guns. After beating and tying up Martin, the gang ransacks the house, smashes one of his cars, and raids his wine collection. The youngest skinhead, Bubs, steals a deactivated revolver from the house during the burglary. Gabrielle tells Martin the burglary is revenge for his years of abuse, then reveals to Davey her plan to take Hando away from his violent life. Martin eventually frees himself and uses a handgun to scare away the gang, who flee in the trashed vehicle and leave behind most of the stolen goods. Due to this incident, Davey begins to question his violent lifestyle. Agitated by Gabrielle's criticism of the poor outcome of the robbery and their living conditions, Hando abruptly hits, berates, dumps, and then evicts her. Davey, unable to tolerate the excess violence and Hando's cruel and unpredictable nature any further, declares his departure from the gang and gives Gabrielle his German grandmother's address, where he will be staying. Gabrielle informs the police of the gang's location and spends the night with Davey, where they confess their feelings for each other. Davey also reveals his doubts about his violent lifestyle to Gabrielle, having removed the racist patches from his flight jacket out of concern for his grandmother. The morning after, the police raid the warehouse where the skinhead gang is hiding. Bubs is shot in the head after pointing the stolen deactivated gun at the police, and what remains of the gang is beaten and arrested. Hando, who was returning to the warehouse and fled when he spotted the police, successfully evades capture as the last remaining member of his gang. Arriving at Davey's granny-flat, Hando finds his friend in bed with Gabrielle. Hando accuses her of informing the police, but Davey says they were together the whole time since leaving the squat. Hando convinces Davey and Gabrielle to come with him by claiming the police will soon raid the residence, and the trio go on the run. They rob a service station, where Hando strangles the Asian attendant to death; and, after driving all night, they stop at a beach the next morning. There, Gabrielle overhears a conversation wherein Hando tries to convince Davey to abandon her. Feeling betrayed, Gabrielle sets their car on fire and admits to tipping the police off about the gang's whereabouts. Hando, infuriated beyond sense, immediately attacks her and attempts to asphyxiate her multiple times, first by strangling her and then by drowning her in the surf. Davey attempts to fight Hando several times and successfully disrupts each attempt on Gabrielle's life, but he is quickly fought off and beaten down each time. Eventually, Hando attempts to smother Gabrielle in the sand, and Davey, desperate to save Gabrielle, stabs Hando in the neck with his Hitler Youth knife, who staggers away before finally collapsing. As a busload of Japanese tourists looks on, a weeping Davey attempts to comfort a petrified Gabrielle as Hando's bloody corpse gazes lifelessly out at the ocean.

Wright contacted Sweetman via mail in 1991, to request an interview. Sweetman was at that time in the process of serving a life sentence in Pentridge Prison for murder. The interview could not be arranged in a timely manner due to prison regulations, so the two men commenced correspondence, and Sweetman furnished Wright with a transcript of his murder trial, from which Wright drew influence. This influence is most clearly seen in the line delivered by Hando when scaring off squatters from the warehouse: \\"I'll chop your legs off\\". It is a direct reference to Sweetman's having cut off the legs of his victim. That was one of many aspects of the film that mirrored Sweetman's life. A further example is the characters Gabrielle, Davey, and the punk girls were all based on associates of Sweetman. Sweetman's name was conspicuously absent in the end credits, however. This issue was raised in the Australian media during the publicity phase of promoting the film. Russell Crowe acknowledged the origin of his character during an interview on Tonight Live with Steve Vizard in 1992. Wright has also cited Sweetman as an inspiration on the film's characters. The film was financed by the Australian Film Commission with Film Victoria. Soundtrack The film's score was released by Picture This Records. It included the orchestral music and the energetic punk rock music similar to the Oi! genre (recorded by studio musicians). White Power labels have bootlegged the RAC tracks and released them on a 7\\" many times since the soundtrack's release. In 2011, a Russian WP label released the whole soundtrack on a 12\\". The RAC songs are often misattributed to real RAC bands on peer to peer sites, with Skrewdriver being used often. The band is also often called \\"Master Race\\" due to Peter Pales's German-language monologue in the beginning of \\"Pulling on the Boots\\". Some people have also considered the Australian punk band the Bastard Squad to have done the soundtrack, due to the line \\"Jason from the Bastard Squad\\" being in the thank you section at the movie's end credits. The actual versions of the RAC songs used in the film are earlier versions to what ended up on the commercial CD‚Äîmost obvious being \\"Fuhrer Fuhrer\\", which plays in the scene after Hando is notified about Vietnamese being at the Railway Hotel‚ÄîClifford-White's intonation is slightly different and there are no backing vocals in the chorus. In 2014, bassist Chris Pettifer was interviewed for Vice Magazine about the soundtrack, in which he expressed his disappointment about how genuine neo-Nazi groups had embraced the Oi! songs.\\"Is the Romper Stomper Soundtrack the Best Racist Punk Rock Ever Performed by Non-Racist Session Musicians?\\".

Box office and reception Romper Stomper grossed $3.2 million at the box office in Australia. The film has an approval rating of 79% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.29/10. David Stratton of SBS The Movie Show praised the acting style in the film but was appalled at the level of violence, and as a consequence refused to give it a rating while fellow Movie Show critic Margaret Pomeranz gave it four-and-a-half stars. Stratton also described the film in Variety as \\"A Clockwork Orange without the intellect\\". Wright was so upset by Stratton's rating that he later poured a glass of wine on Stratton during a chance meeting at the 1994 Venice Film Festival. Stratton would many years later clarify his rating stating: \\"I think Romper Stomper was a very well-made film and an extremely well-acted film, and I thought Geoffrey Wright had a lot of talent. What troubled me about Romper Stomper was that it was made in a time, I think 1992, when there had been some racial problems with young Vietnamese people, particularly in Melbourne, and...I thought the film could stir up more violence...\\" Influence The film was highly controversial because of its violent content. In March 2000, British prisoner Robert Stewart bludgeoned his cellmate, Zahid Mubarek, to death with a wooden table leg at the Feltham Young Offenders' Institution. In 2004, Stewart was found guilty of the racially motivated murder of Mubarek and was jailed for life. Stewart compared himself to Hando in Romper Stomper as well as Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange. An inquiry heard that Stewart had watched Romper Stomper two days before the killing. A member of the inquiry team said he was a prolific letter writer, and much of his correspondence contained racist and violent content: \\"He sees himself in the correspondence starring in the film Romper Stomper as a racist thug attacking gooks,\\" the inquiry was told. The Anti-Nazi League protested against the film's London premiere.Romper Stomper moved racist to kill The Age (Melbourne). 2004-11-21. Retrieved 20 June 2011. Dylann Roof, the perpetrator of the Charleston church shooting, had an image of Hando dying on the homepage of his personal website. Television series In August 2017, Australian video streaming service Stan announced that it was producing Romper Stomper, a six-part television series, as a sequel to the film. The film's director, Geoffrey Wright, will direct two episodes, alongside fellow directors Daina Reid and James Napier Robertson.

He was shifted to center field in 1957 to allow rookie Eddie Kasko to break in at third, and led all NL outfielders in fielding percentage, but returned to third base in 1958, winning the first of four consecutive Gold Gloves and again collecting 90 RBI while batting .307 and scoring 100 runs for the first time. That year he also became the Cardinals' regular cleanup hitter, a role he would hold regularly for the remainder of his time with the club. His 41 double plays in 1958 equalled the second-highest total in NL history to that point, and fell just two short of Hank Thompson's 1950 league mark; he also led the league in putouts (156). Boyer in 1955 He became the Cardinal team captain in 1959, and compiled a 29-game hitting streak from August 10 to September 12 of that year, during which he batted .350 with eight home runs and 23 RBI; it was the longest hitting streak in the major leagues since Musial's 30-game run in 1950. Boyer finished 10th in the MVP voting that season after batting .309 with 28 home runs and 94 RBI, and began a run of six consecutive All-Star selections, starting the second of the two 1959 games; he again led the NL with 32 double plays. In 1960‚Äì61 Boyer led the Cardinals in batting average (.304 and .329), home runs (32 and 24), runs (95 and 109), RBI (97 and 95) and total bases (310 and 314), and finished 6th and 7th in the MVP voting. He led the league with 37 double plays in 1960, and with 346 assists in 1961. He was also named the NL's Player of the Month for September 1960 after batting .385. He hit for the cycle, with an additional single, in the second game of a doubleheader on September 14, 1961, against the Cubs, becoming the first player in history to complete the cycle with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th inning for a 6-5 victory; his RBI double in the 9th inning had tied the game. In that game he also joined Musial as the only Cardinals to hit two walk-off home runs in a season in two different years; Boyer also had two walk-off homers in 1958 (May 31 and June 11; he was the fourth Cardinal to hit two extra-inning walk-off homers in a season, with both leading off the bottom of the 12th inning) and a previous one in 1961 on August 8. On September 19, 1962, Boyer broke Rogers Hornsby's team record for home runs by a right-handed hitter with his 194th career round-tripper, a 2-run shot off Billy O'Dell in the first inning of a 7-4 loss to the San Francisco Giants. He finished the season with 98 RBI, equaling his career best to that point, and started both All-Star games, also leading the league in double plays for the last time with 34. On June 7, 1963, Boyer became the second Cardinal to hit 200 career homers, connecting off Al Jackson in the 4th inning of a 3-2 road loss to the New York Mets. He was again named to the NL All-Star starting lineup, increased his RBI season total to 111 that year, and won his fifth Gold Glove award. Boyer had his best season in 1964, keeping the Cardinals alive for much of the season as he batted .350 in May and .342 in July, and starting for the NL in his last All-Star appearance. On June 16, he became the 19th player in major league history to hit for the cycle twice, and the seventh to hit for a natural cycle, in a 7-1 road victory against the Houston Colt .45s. Boyer's productivity early in the season kept the team in contention, although they were still only 54-51 and tied for fifth place on August 4; they fell 11 games out of first place by August 23, but mounted one of the great comebacks in history, overtaking the Philadelphia Phillies in the final weeks to win the NL pennant by a single game; Boyer batted .400 in five September games against the Phillies. He enjoyed his career highlight against the New York Yankees in the 1964 World Series, hitting a grand slam in Game 4 off pitcher Al Downing to give the Cardinals a 4‚Äì3 victory; the home run came after Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson misplayed Dick Groat's double play ground ball, which would have ended the inning without any damage done. His brother Clete, playing in his fifth consecutive Series with the Yankees, later conceded that he was privately thrilled for his brother because it was Ken's first Series. Then, in the decisive Game 7, he collected three hits (including a double and a home run), and scored three runs as St. Louis clinched the World Championship 7‚Äì5, their first title since 1946. Clete also homered in that game, the only time in World Series history that brothers have homered in the same game. Boyer earned National League MVP honors after hitting .295 with 24 home runs and leading the league with 119 RBI, becoming the first NL third baseman to do so since Heinie Zimmerman in ; he was also honored as The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year, and received the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award for character and integrity. It was also his seventh consecutive season of 90 or more RBI, tying Pie Traynor's major league record for third basemen. Boyer hit exactly 24 home runs in each of 4 consecutive years (1961‚Äì1964) (32 homers in 1960 and 13 homers in 1965) to set a record for most consecutive years with the same home run total and at least 20 home runs; the record was tied by Fred Lynn of the California Angels and Baltimore Orioles (23 each year from 1984 to 1987). On July 10, 1965, Boyer hit his 250th home run off Dick Ellsworth in the 9th inning of a 5-3 road loss to the Cubs, and on September 28 he became the fifth Cardinal to drive in 1,000 runs, in the 9th inning of a 9-1 road win against the Giants. After 11 years with the Cardinals, Boyer began to suffer back problems in 1965, but still led the league in fielding percentage (.968) for the only time in his career; after batting just .260 with 13 homers and 75 RBI. New York Mets In October 1965, Boyer was traded to the New York Mets for Al Jackson and third baseman Charley Smith. With the downtrodden Mets, he was stuck on a losing team but managed to achieve several more career milestones. On May 13, 1966, he scored his 1,000th run in a 5-4 17-inning loss to the Giants; he ended the year batting .266 with 14 home runs and 61 RBI. On May 10, 1967, he collected his 2,000th career hit, a single off Milt Pappas in the 4th inning of a 7-4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, and on May 20 he hit his 300th career double off Nelson Briles in an 11-9 loss to the Cardinals. Chicago White Sox On July 27, 1967, with Boyer batting .235, the Mets traded him to the Chicago White Sox along with second baseman Sandy Alomar, in exchange for third baseman Bill Southworth, whose career ended after he spent the remainder of the year in the minors, and catcher J. C. Martin. Boyer hit .261 over the rest of the season, but the White Sox released him on May 2, 1968, after he batted only .125 in 10 games. Los Angeles Dodgers Boyer signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 10, 1968. He hit .271 in his return to the NL, and he appeared in his 2,000th game on September 7 in a 4-2 loss at Cincinnati. Boyer returned to the Dodgers in 1969, but he was used almost exclusively as a pinch hitter. He appeared in his last game on August 9, 1969, a 4-0 loss to the Cubs, grounding out as a pinch hitter in the 9th inning. After batting just .206 in 25 games that season, Boyer felt that his playing career was over and he wanted to become a coach. The Dodgers encouraged him to return as a player for the 1970 season, feeling that young players would be more likely to listen to him as a veteran player than as a coach, but Boyer chose to retire. In his 15-year MLB career, Boyer was a .287 hitter with 2,143 hits, 282 home runs and 1,141 RBI, 1,104 runs scored, 318 doubles, 68 triples and 105 stolen bases in 2,034 games played; he also batted .348 with two home runs in his seven All- Star and ten All-Star Game appearances (played in 7/8 games in 1959‚Äì62).Donnelly, Patrick.

His career slugging average of .462 ranked third among players with at least 1,000 games at third base, behind Eddie Mathews (.509) and Ron Santo (then at .478), and among NL players he trailed only Mathews in assists and double plays at third base. Upon Clete's retirement in 1971, the Boyers' 444 career home runs (282 by Ken, 162 by Clete) were the fourth most in major league history by two brothers, behind Hank and Tommie Aaron (768) and the separate pairings of Joe DiMaggio with his brothers Vince (486) and Dom (448).Spatz, p. 175. Boyer's 12 career walk-off hits for the Cardinals remain a record for any player since 1950, equaled only by Lou Brock and Albert Pujols. On April 28, 2007, Pujols broke his Cardinals record for right-handed hitters with his 256th career home run, in an 8-1 loss to the Cubs; he had tied the mark six days earlier with a 3-run homer in the 12th inning at Chicago. Post-playing career Boyer became a manager in the Cardinals' minor league system, first leading the Arkansas Travelers of the Texas League in 1970. He returned to the Cardinals as a coach under former teammate Red Schoendienst in 1971‚Äì72, then went back to managing in the minors, leading the Gulf Coast League Cardinals (1973), Tulsa Oilers of the American Association (1974‚Äì76), and Rochester Red Wings of the International League (1977‚Äì78); he won a league title with Tulsa in 1974. Among the players he developed in the minors were Keith Hernandez, Garry Templeton, Mike Easler, Tito Landrum, and Larry Herndon. Boyer was named manager of the Cardinals in early 1978, after Vern Rapp was fired with the team at 6-11 (Jack Krol served as interim manager for two games), and posted a 62-81 record. The following year St. Louis finished in third place at 86-76, but Boyer was dismissed 51 games into the 1980 season with a record of 18-33; Krol again served a game as interim manager before Whitey Herzog took over the reins. Boyer finished with a 166‚Äì190 record in three seasons. He was scheduled to return to Rochester for the 1981 season, but lung cancer forced him to give up the job. Hall of Fame candidacy =BBWAA= Boyer became eligible for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975, at a time when the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) had only elected one third baseman in thirty elections (Traynor in 1948); despite his 512 home runs, Mathews had received just 32% of the vote in 1974. Boyer fared no better in the voting than most other star third basemen, and received less than 5% of the vote every year before being dropped from consideration after the 1979 vote. After several years of complaints about overlooked candidates, Boyer was one of three players restored to the ballot in 1985, along with Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood and fellow third baseman Ron Santo - who had himself received less than 4% of the vote in his only year on the ballot in 1980. For four years, Boyer outpaced Santo in the voting, peaking at 25.5% of the vote in 1988; but popular support for Santo grew afterward, and he outdrew Boyer every year afterward until Boyer's eligibility expired after the 1994 vote. Santo received 43% of the vote in his final year in 1998. =Veterans Committee= Boyer has since been a candidate on the Veterans Committee ballot in 2003, 2005, and 2007. =Golden Era Committee= Boyer appeared again on the Golden Era Committee (replaced the Veterans Committee in 2010 and votes every 3 years) ballot of 10 candidates from the 1947‚Äì1972 era, in 2011 and 2014. Ron Santo's nomination (the only candidate elected in 2011) in 2012 has led to suggestions that Boyer's chances of election to the Hall of Fame have increased, but in each of the two elections, Boyer fell short by 9 of the 12 required votes for Hall of Fame election. None of the 10 candidates (three of the nine player candidates including Boyer were MVP winners) were elected by the Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee in 2014. Honors Boyer was inducted into the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame in 2012. His number 14, which he wore throughout his career with the Cardinals, was retired by the team on Sunday May 20, 1984. In 2014, the Cardinals announced Boyer among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014. Personal life Ken Boyer married Kathleen Oliver in April 1952. The couple had four children - Susie, David (born December 28, 1955), Danny, and Janie - but eventually divorced; David was drafted by the Cardinals in 1974 and played in their farm system until 1978. Boyer died from cancer in St. Louis on Tuesday September 7, 1982, at the age of 51; he had undergone laetrile treatments in Mexico in an attempt to fight the disease. He was buried in Friends Cemetery in Purcell, Missouri. He was survived by 12 of his 13 siblings, and by his four children.

The film features Michael Caine as secret agent Harry Palmer, the anti-hero protagonist. The \\"brain\\" of the title is a sophisticated computerThe computer consoles in the film are Honeywell 200 mainframe consoles. with which an anti- communist organisation controls its worldwide anti-Soviet spy network. Billion Dollar Brain is the third of the Harry Palmer film series, preceded by The Ipcress File (1965) and Funeral in Berlin (1966). It is the only film in which Ken Russell worked as a mainstream 'director-for-hire', and the last film of Fran√ßoise Dorl√©ac. A fourth film in the series, an adaptation of Horse Under Water, also to be released by United Artists, was tentatively planned but never made. Caine played Palmer in two later films, Bullet to Beijing and Midnight in Saint Petersburg. Plot Harry Palmer (Michael Caine), who has left MI5 to work as a private investigator, is told by a mechanical voice on the phone to take a package to Helsinki. The package contains six virus-laden eggs that have been stolen from the British government's research facility at Porton Down. In Helsinki, he is met by Anya (Fran√ßoise Dorl√©ac), who takes him to meet her handler, Harry's old friend Leo Newbigen (Karl Malden). Leo is in love with Anya, but Harry sees that she is only pretending to reciprocate. Leo takes Harry to a secret room where a computer issues daily instructions to Leo and Anya, speaking in the same voice that summoned Harry to Helsinki. After determining that he cannot trust either Leo or Anya, Harry is abducted by his former MI5 superior, Colonel Ross (Guy Doleman), who coerces him into working once more for the British government in pursuing the conspiracy. Harry is ordered to Latvia, in the USSR, where he embeds with some rebels to obtain intelligence. After being captured and left for dead, Harry is set free by Colonel Stok (Oskar Homolka), an old acquaintance from the KGB. Back in Helsinki, Anya tries to kill Harry while seducing him, then confesses that the computer told her to kill him. Harry locks her in a room and waits for Leo at the computer. Leo offers to pay off Harry for his trouble, but Harry insists on half of the money Leo is getting from whatever the conspiracy is all about. The pair go to Texas, where Harry meets oil tycoon General Midwinter (Ed Begley). Midwinter proudly displays his billion-dollar \\"brain\\", a room full of computers dispensing orders to his agents around the world. The General is in the midst of planning a rebellion in Latvia, which he thinks will trigger the fall of Communism worldwide. He thinks Leo has hired hundreds of Latvian agents, but actually there are only a handful, as Leo is pocketing the money. The General plans to begin a rebellion using these agents while his own private army invades to back them, and simultaneously infect the Red Army with the viruses. Meanwhile, Leo subverts Midwinter's computer orders and escapes with the eggs. Midwinter realises Harry is a double agent, but Harry tells him what Leo is doing and convinces him that he can track Leo down. Back in Helsinki, Leo and Anya board a train for Moscow with the eggs, but Harry, accompanied by two of Midwinter's men, chases the train in a car, intercepts it, and escorts Leo off the train with the eggs. Anya shoots Harry's bodyguards as the train pulls away from a station near the border. Leo runs after the train with the eggs. Anya takes them, but pushes him off the train. \\"She used me\\", Leo tells Harry. He then offers to help Harry stop Midwinter's insane plan, which could trigger World War III. In personnel carriers disguised as his company's oil tanker trucks, Midwinter leads his private army across the frozen Baltic Sea into Latvia. Harry and Leo attempt to catch up with the General, but he orders their car to be fired upon and Leo is killed. Meanwhile, Stok is fully aware of the invasion and orders bombers to intercept the convoy. Rather than bombing it directly, they simply drop the bombs on the ice in its path. The entire convoy plunges through the ice into the freezing water, and all the vehicles and soldiers‚Äîincluding General Midwinter himself‚Äîsink to a cold, watery Baltic grave. Harry awakes alone on an ice floe. Stok arrives in a helicopter with Anya, introducing her as his agent. He gives the eggs to Harry, explaining, \\"We don't need them; we have our own ideas.\\" Back in London, Harry delivers the eggs to Ross, who agrees to reward Harry with a promotion. However, when he opens the package to inspect the eggs, he finds it is now full of baby chicks.

It is unclear whether or not her voice was dubbed by another actress, due to her death. Location filming for Billion Dollar Brain took place in Helsinki and other parts of Finland, including Turku. The Riga scenes were filmed in Porvoo, also in Finland. Scenes involving \\"The Brain\\" were filmed in Honeywell facilities and featured a Honeywell 200 mini-computer. The remainder of the film was shot in the United Kingdom. Scenes on the ice were filmed on a disused airfield which was covered with a layer of salt. All other scenes were shot at Pinewood Studios, including the scene where Midwinter's convoy falls through the broken ice - this was done in a giant tank with slabs of polystyrene used to represent the ice itself. The large size of the tank was deemed necessary because of the decision to use real vehicles instead of miniatures. Otto Heller ‚Äì who had photographed the first two Harry Palmer films ‚Äì was supposed to shoot the film but would not submit to a medical examination and so the production could not hire him.

To create a relentless, harsh mood, he left out sweet-sounding instruments like violins and flutes and relied mainly on brass and percussionInterview on Film Score Monthly, quoted in including three pianos, which are featured prominently in the main theme, and later, together with the percussion, create sonorities similar to Stravinsky's Les Noces. The score is basically monothematic, constantly varying the main theme. For more romantic moods, it features the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument, played by its most prominent soloist, Jeanne Loriod. Thus, even the tender moments have an eerie undertone. Later on, Harry Palmer attends the end of a symphony concert, which is supposed to feature Dmitri Shostakovich's \\"Leningrad\\" Symphony, written in 1941 during the siege of Leningrad. What we hear, however, is the end of Shostakovich's 11th Symphony \\"The Year 1905\\". Yet, music from the \\"Leningrad\\" symphony is featured later on during Midwinter's speech to his soldiers in Finland and during the final battle on the ice. Reception =Critical= The film has a 50% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 6 reviews with an average rating of 5.9/10.

Laminate flooring simulates wood (or sometimes stone) with a photographic applique layer under a clear protective layer. The inner core layer is usually composed of melamine resin and fiber board materials. There is a European Standard No. EN 13329:2000 specifying laminate floor covering requirements and testing methods. Laminate flooring has grown significantly in popularity, perhaps because it may be easier to install and maintain than more traditional surfaces such as hardwood flooring. It may also have the advantages of costing less and requiring less skill to install than alternative flooring materials. It is reasonably durable, hygienic (several brands contain an antimicrobial resin), and relatively easy to maintain. Installation Laminate floors are reasonably easy for a DIY homeowner to install. Laminate flooring is packaged as a number of tongue and groove planks, which can be clicked into one another. Sometimes a glue backing is provided for ease of installation. Installed laminate floors typically \\"float\\" over the sub-floor on top of a foam/film underlayment, which provides moisture- and sound-reducing properties. A small () gap is required between the flooring and any immovable object such as walls, this allows the flooring to expand without being obstructed. Baseboards (skirting boards) can be removed and then reinstalled after laying of the flooring is complete for a neater finish, or the baseboard can be left in place with the flooring butted into it, then small beading trims such as shoe moulding or the larger quarter- round moulding can be fitted to the bottoms of the baseboards. Saw cuts on the planks are usually required at edges and around cupboard and door entrances, but professional installers typically use door jamb undercut saws to cut out a space to a height that allows the flooring to go under the door jamb & casing for a cleaner look. Improper installation can result in peaking, in which adjacent boards form a V shape projecting from the floor, or gaps, in which two adjacent boards are separated from each other. Installation of laminate flooring - note underlay to allow for contraction, expansion, and moisture control and method for squaring and distancing from wall.Fitting individual laminate planks.Secure tongue-and-groove connections create floor that is both tight and flexible. Care It is important to keep laminate clean, as dust, dirt, and sand particles may scratch the surface over time in high-traffic areas. It is also important to keep laminate relatively dry, since sitting water/moisture can cause the planks to swell, warp, etc., though some brands are equipped with water-resistant coatings. Water spills aren't a problem if they're wiped up quickly, and not allowed to sit for a prolonged period of time. Adhesive felt pads are often placed on the feet of furniture on laminate floors to prevent scratching. Inferior glueless laminate floors may gradually become separated, creating visible gaps between planks. It is important to \\"tap\\" the planks back together using the appropriate tool as gaps are noticed in order to prevent dirt filling the gaps, thus making it more difficult to put into place. Quality glueless laminate floors use joining mechanisms which hold the planks together under constant tension which prevent dirt entering the joints and do not need \\"tapping\\" back together periodically. Advocacy The North American Laminate Flooring Association (NALFA) is a trade association of laminate flooring manufacturers and laminate flooring manufacturer suppliers in the United States and Canada. It is a standards developing organization accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to develop voluntary consensus standards for laminate flooring materials, and it has established testing and performance criteria that are used in North America. NALFA issues a certification mark named the NALFA Certification Seal which signifies that the product has passed 10 performance tests, has been proven to meet these standards by an independent, third-party testing lab, and has been manufactured in North America. The certification review includes: # Static Load ‚Äì Measures the ability of laminate flooring to resist residual indentation resulting from a static load. # Thickness Swell ‚Äì Measures the ability of laminate flooring to resist increase in thickness after being exposed to water. # Light Resistance ‚Äì Measures the ability of laminate flooring to retain its color when exposed to a light source having a frequency range approximating sunlight through window glass. It is not intended to show the resistance to continuous exposure to outdoor weathering conditions. # Cleanability and Stain Resistance ‚Äì Measures both the ease of cleanability and stain resistance of laminate flooring to common household substances. # Large Ball Resistance ‚Äì Measures the ability of laminate flooring to resist fracture due to impact by a large diameter ball. # Small Ball Resistance ‚Äì Measures the ability of laminate flooring to resist fracture due to impact by a small diameter ball. # Water Resistance ‚Äì Measures the ability of the surface of laminate flooring to resist abrasive wear through the d√©cor layer. # Dimension Tolerance ‚Äì Measures the dimensional variance between tiles of laminate flooring in a manufactured free standing (unrestricted) shape in respect to thickness, length, width, straightness and squareness. # Caster Chair Resistance ‚Äì Specifies a method for determining the change of appearance and stability of a laminate floor, including joints, under the movement of a caster chair. # Surface Bond ‚Äì Measures the force required to delaminate or split away the surface of laminate flooring plank or tile. Potential health effects and LEED status Laminate flooring is often made of melamine resin, a compound made with formaldehyde. The formaldehyde is more tightly bound in Melamine formaldehyde (MF) than it is in Urea- Formaldehyde (UF), reducing emissions and potential health effects. Thus LEED v2.2's EQ Credit 4.4 precludes the use of UF, but allows the use of MF. Laminated flooring is commonly used in LEED residential and commercial applications. History Laminate flooring was invented in 1977 by the Swedish company , and sold under the brand name Pergo. They had been making floor surfaces since 1923. The company first marketed its product to Europe in 1984, and later to the United States in 1994. Perstorp spun off its flooring division as the separate company named Pergo, now a subsidiary of Mohawk Industries. Pergo is the most widely known laminate flooring manufacturer, but the trademark PERGO is not synonymous for all laminate floors. Glueless laminate flooring was invented in 1996 by the Swedish company V√§linge Aluminium (now V√§linge Innovation) and sold under the names of Alloc and Fiboloc. However, a system for holding flooring panels together was also developed in parallel by the Belgian company Unilin released in 1997 and sold under the name of . The two companies have been in a great number of legal conflicts over the years, and today most, if not all glueless locking flooring is made under license from either V√§linge, Unilin, or even a combination of both.

Early life Born in Jacksonville, Florida, he was forced to leave school at a young age to support his mother and younger brother. After a series of odd-jobs and a brief stint in his own band, Tuttle moved to Los Angeles in 1930 and began taking art classes at the University of Southern California, where he would meet his future collaborator Charles Schram. Around the same time, he began working as a page at Fox Studios. Career Tuttle began working under makeup artist Jack Dawn at Twentieth Century Pictures. In 1934, Tuttle and Dawn moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Working as Dawn's assistant, Tuttle supervised the makeup work in such movies as The Wizard of Oz and Father of the Bride. Tuttle created makeup for many of Hollywood's biggest stars, among them Judy Garland (‚ÄúSummer Stock‚Äù, 1950); Gene Kelly (‚ÄúSingin‚Äô in the Rain‚Äù, 1952); Katharine Hepburn (‚ÄúPat and Mike‚Äù, 1952) and Esther Williams (‚ÄúMillion Dollar Mermaid‚Äù, 1952). Eventually, he worked his way up to head of the studio's makeup department. In the 1950s, he would be responsible for the makeup in Singin' in the Rain, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, Forbidden Planet, North by Northwest and The Time Machine. He reused pieces he first created for The Time Machine in \\"Eye of the Beholder\\", one of his many Twilight Zone contributions. In 1965, Tuttle received a special Oscar for his work on George Pal's 7 Faces of Dr. Lao; this was 17 years before makeup became an official Oscar category. Later work included Logan's Run and Young Frankenstein. Tuttle is the subject of the 1968 MGM short The King of the Duplicators where he demonstrated some of his work. He also appeared as himself in the documentary film The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal (1985), produced and directed by Arnold Leibovit. Later in life, Tuttle managed his company known as Custom Color Cosmetics. Personal life Tuttle was married five times. He was the first husband of Oscar-winning film and television star Donna Reed.

The company also operates in the lodging, sporting, airport, gambling and entertainment industries. The company employs over 55,000 people worldwide and has over $3.2 billion in annual revenues. History Delaware North began as Jacobs Brothers, founded in Buffalo, New York, in 1915 by brothers Marvin, Charles and Louis Jacobs.Schwartz, Jason. \\"Jeremy Jacobs Looks Like a Saint Compared To His Father,\\" Boston (magazine), March 27, 2013. Retrieved August 25, 2018 Its name was changed first to Emprise Corp.and then Sportsystems Inc. before adopting its current one in 1980.\\"TW Services loses bid for Yosemite, Sportservice wins concessions contract,\\" GoUpstate.com, Friday, December 18, 1992. Retrieved August 25, 2018 The company remains family-owned and operated by Jeremy Jacobs, who also owns the Boston Bruins. The arena in which the Bruins play, the TD Garden, is owned by Delaware North. Jacobs is also a member of the U.S. Department of Commerce Travel and Tourism Board. Jacobs Brothers initially operated theater concessions. When the establishments closed down in the hot summer months, the three men turned their attention to ballparks, the first being Offermann Stadium, and the creation of the sports concession industry. Sportservice was created in 1926 following contracts with minor-league ballparks in Buffalo and Syracuse, New York. Sportservice is Delaware North's largest operating company. In 1930, the company entered into its first major-league deal by signing an agreement with the Detroit Tigers to handle food service at Navin Field. The Jacobs brothers expanded their business in 1939 by acquiring a racetrack, marking the beginning of Delaware North Companies Gaming & Entertainment. In 1941, the company entered the airport arena with a contract to provide food service in Washington National Airport. Delaware North Companies Travel Hospitality Services operates in more than 30 major airports worldwide. Upon the death of his father, founder Louis M. Jacobs in 1968, Jeremy M. Jacobs began leading the company, then called Emprise, at the age of 28. The years that followed were characterized by unprecedented growth and diversification. In 1972, after negative press over alleged connections to organized crime in Sports Illustrated and the Arizona Republic, the Emprise company was convicted of federal racketeering charges over the purchase of the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas with members of the Mob. Jeremy dissolved Emprise and reorganized his family's holdings under a new company, Delaware North (named after the intersection of Delaware Avenue and North Street in Buffalo where the company was headquartered at the time), with a public emphasis on operating a clean, separate organization with no connection to Emprise. Delaware North acquired the Boston Garden in 1975 while Jeremy Jacobs purchased the Boston Bruins, one of the original six franchises of the National Hockey League. In 1987, the company acquired Sky Chefs, (now LSG Sky Chefs) a move that bolstered its airport business. The company obtained the contract to provide visitor services in Yosemite National Park in 1993. under the terms of the largest concessions contract in the U.S. National Park Service. The award sowed the seeds of a new line of business: Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts. In 1995, Delaware North won the contract to run the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. In the late 1990s, the company worked toward becoming the largest racino operator in North America by adding gambling to some of its racetrack properties. The company moved its World Headquarters from the Main Court Building to the Key Center South Tower in 1999. The company became the first U.S. hospitality company in the world to have its GreenPath environmental management system registered to the guidelines put forth by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14001) in 1991. In the early 2000s, the company became a hotel owner by purchasing Tenaya Lodge at the entrance to Yosemite and Harrison Hot Springs Resort & Spa in British Columbia, and by building a hotel at its gambling and racing destination resort in Wheeling, West Virginia. 2004 saw the company beginning GuestPath, its companywide continuous improvement process. The company entered the European market with a contract at Wembley Stadium, followed by one at Emirates Stadium in 2006 and 2007. In 2008, the company signed a 10-year contract at Pride Park Stadium, Derby. In 2008/2009, Delaware North got a contract to operate a 4,500 slot machine racino at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, New York. It lost the contract in 2009 when it could not make a $370 million upfront payment to the state of New York. The company was hired by Garrison Investments in 2009 to operate the RMS Queen Mary in Long Beach CA. This partnership ended in April 2011. In 2010, the company acquired Jumer's Casino & Hotel located in Rock Island, Illinois. Thereafter, the company entered the European travel hospitality market opening outlets at Gatwick, Heathrow, and Edinburgh Airports, and the Euston Railway Station. It also acquired the Australian Resorts at Lizard Island, Heron Island, and Wilson Island on the Great Barrier Reef and King's Canyon in the Red Centre of Australia. In 2014, Delaware North launched a new global brand identity as the company prepared to celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2015. The company is now known just as \\"Delaware North\\" ‚Äì no longer as \\"Delaware North Companies\\" ‚Äì and ended the use of the abbreviation \\"DNC\\" in its logo. The majority of its operating companies, which previously had been identified as \\"Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts,\\" for example, are now called \\"Delaware North.\\" The only exceptions are Delaware North Sportservice ‚Äì given its historical importance as the company's original operating company and brand recognition in the sports industry ‚Äì and Delaware North's most recent acquisition, Patina Restaurant Group. In 2014, Delaware North issued a letter to the U.S. National Park Service, asserting various intellectual property rights, including such names as Ahwahnee, Curry Village, Wawona and other historic names it acquired when it purchased the Yosemite Park & Curry Company in 1993 with NPS approval. The letter estimated the value of those names at $51 million,http://www.buffalonews.com/business/delaware-north-loses-contract-for- hospitality-at-yosemite-20150618 while NPS estimated it at $3.5 million. A breach of contract lawsuit to determine their value was resolved in July 2019 with Delaware North receiving a $12 million settlement, the majority of which was paid by new Yosemite concessionaire Aramark, and the original place names being restored by NPS and Aramark. On January 6, 2015, Delaware North Chairman Jeremy Jacobs relinquished the title of CEO and named Jerry Jacobs Jr. and Louis Jacobs Co-CEO's. He also named Charlie Jacobs CEO of Delaware North's Boston Holdings. In 2015, Delaware North moved its corporate offices to the Delaware North Building in Buffalo, returning the company's headquarters to the namesake avenue after nearly 25 years.

Controversies Delaware North Companies, having lost the contract to run the concessions at Yosemite to Aramark in 2015, claimed that the names of many historic sites within Yosemite actually belong to them, and not to the United States Government. The site names include Curry Village, Ahwahnee Lodge, Wawona Hotel, Half Dome, and the name of the park itself, Yosemite National Park. The result has been a public relations nightmare for DNC, including calls for boycott of its concessions at other sites. Delaware North sued the National Park Service in the United States Court of Claims for breach of contract. The lawsuit was settled in July 2019, with Aramark and the Park Service paying Delaware North a total of $12 million in exchange for the trademarks and tangible assets. In 2020, Delaware North placed Vice President of Development Nate McMurray on unpaid leave without explanation. McMurray was running for Congress against Chris Jacobs, a member of the family that owns the company. McMurray viewed the move as retaliation for running against Jacobs. Awards and recognition Five Delaware North chefs competed in the 2008 Culinary Olympics in Erfurt, Germany. Delaware North's corporate chef and chief culinary ambassador Roland Henin coached the group. Each chef earned an award for their efforts. Executive sous chef Ambarish Lulay and executive chef Scott Green earned silver medals. Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts won the Space Foundation's Douglas S.

The technique involves making repeated web site requests using a fake referrer URL to the site the spammer wishes to advertise. Sites that publish their access logs, including referrer statistics, will then inadvertently link back to the spammer's site. These links will be indexed by search engines as they crawl the access logs, improving the spammer's search engine ranking. Except for polluting their statistics, the technique does not harm the affected sites. At least since 2014, a new variation of this form of spam occurs on Google Analytics. Spammers send fake visits to Google Analytics, often without ever accessing the affected site. The technique is used to have the spammers' URLs appear in the site statistics, inducing the site owner to visit the spam URLs. When the spammer never visited the affected site, the fake visits are also called Ghost Spam. Technical solutions As with e-mail spam, referrer spam may be filtered or blocked. A website operator may mitigate referrer spam by preventing search engine spiders from crawling the site logs by moving them to a non-public area such as a password-protected area, by using a robot exclusion file, or by appending the nofollow value to the links. Spammers that target third party analytics directly can pollute statistics, but do not consume the affected site's resources. Filtering referrer spam from analytics tools will hide it from reports. However, spammers that do visit the affected site will consume server bandwidth. To prevent this misuse, they can be blocked using various techniques, such as by blacklisting a list of IP addresses. Non-technical solutions Because the \`.htaccess\` solutions require technical expertise, several developers have created tools for non- technical people to block the spam more automatically, specifically for Google Analytics.

Hans Julius Zassenhaus (28 May 1912 ‚Äì 21 November 1991) was a German mathematician, known for work in many parts of abstract algebra, and as a pioneer of computer algebra. Biography He was born in Koblenz in 1912. His father was a historian and advocate for Reverence for Life as expressed by Albert Schweitzer. Hans had two brothers, Guenther and Wilfred, and sister Hiltgunt, who wrote an autobiography in 1974. According to her, their father lost his position as school principal due to his philosophy. She wrote:Hiltgunt Zassenhaus (1974) Walls: Resisting the Third Reich, Beacon Press :Hans, my eldest brother, studied mathematics. My brothers Guenther and Wilfred were in medical school. ... only students who participated in Nazi activities would get scholarships. That left us out. Together we made an all-out effort. ... soon our house became a beehive. Day in and day out for the next four years a small army of children of all ages would arrive to be tutored. At the University of Hamburg Zassenhaus came under the influence of Emil Artin. As he wrote later: :His introductory course in analysis that I attended at the age of 17 converted me from a theoretical physicist to a mathematician. When just 21, Zassenhaus was studying composition series in group theory. He proved his butterfly lemma that provides a refinement of two normal chains to isomorphic central chains. Inspired by Artin, Zassenhaus wrote a textbook Lehrbuch der Gruppentheorie that was later translated as Theory of Groups. His thesis was on doubly transitive permutation groups with Frobenius groups as stabilizers. These groups are now called Zassenhaus groups. They have had a deep impact on the classification of finite simple groups. He obtained his doctorate in June 1934, and took the teachers‚Äô exam the next May. He became a scientific assistant at University of Rostock. In 1936 he became assistant to Artin back in Hamburg, but Artin departed for the USA the following year. Zassenhaus gave his Habilitation in 1938. According to his sister Hiltgunt, Hans was \\"called up as a research scientist at a weather station\\" for his part in the German war effort. Zassenhaus married Lieselotte Lohmann in 1942. The couple raised three children: Michael (born 1943), Angela (born 1947), and Peter (born 1949). In 1943 Zassenhaus became extraordinary professor. He became Managing Director of the Hamburg Mathematical Seminar. After the war, and as a fellow of the British Council, Zassenhaus visited the University of Glasgow in 1948. There he was given an honorary Master of Arts degree. The following year he joined the faculty of McGill University where the endowments of Peter Redpath financed a professorship. He was at McGill for a decade with leaves of absence to the Institute for Advanced Study (1955/6) and California Institute of Technology (1958/9). There he was using computers to advance number theory. In 1959 Zassenhaus began teaching at University of Notre Dame and became director of its computing center in 1964. Zassenhaus was a Mershon visiting professor at Ohio State University in the fall of 1963. In 1965 he came to Ohio State permanently. The mathematics department was led by Arnold Ross; Zassenhaus found a home there until his retirement in 1982. Nonetheless, he continued to take leaves of absence for visits to G√∂ttingen (summer 1967), Heidelberg (summer 1969), UCLA (fall 1970), Warwick (fall 1972), CIT (1974/75), U Montreal (1977/78), Saarbr√ºcken (1979/80). He served as editor in chief of the Journal of Number Theory from its first issue in 1967. He won a Lester R. Ford Award in 1968. Hans Zassenhaus died in Columbus, Ohio on November 21, 1991. His doctoral students include Joachim Lambek.

A genuine all-rounder, Bravo bats right-handed and bowls right-arm medium-fast pace. He is particularly known for his aggressive batting in the middle order, and for his \\"at the death\\" bowling. He is also known for his variety of lengths he can bowl at. He also performs as a singer. Since 2004, Bravo has played 40 Test matches, 164 One Day Internationals and 66 Twenty20 Internationals for the West Indies. He was a key member of the West Indies team that won the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2016 ICC World Twenty20 titles. In domestic cricket, Bravo has played for his native Trinidad and Tobago since 2002. He has also played for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League, the Lahore Qalanders and Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Super League, the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League, the Chittagong Kings in the Bangladesh Premier League, and Kent and Essex in English county cricket. In 2013, he was named as a franchise player at the launch of the Caribbean Premier League After initially announcing his retirement from international cricket in October 2018, Bravo came out of retirement in December 2019 in preparation for the 2020 T20 World Cup. Early career Bravo made his first-class debut for Trinidad and Tobago against Barbados in 2002, opening the innings and scoring 15 and 16 but not bowling. He scored his maiden first-class century a month later and was included in the West Indies A squad for their tour of England in 2002. In early 2003 he scored another century but it was a spell of bowling in which he took 6‚Äì11 against the Windward Islands that brought him to prominence as an all-rounder. International career Bravo made his One Day International debut against England in their 2003/04 tour of the Caribbean, in a match in which he failed to bat but took 2‚Äì31 with the ball. In the West Indies tour of England in 2004 Bravo made his Test debut when he was selected for the First Test at Lord's in which he scored 44 and 10 and took three wickets. He finished the Test series with 16 wickets and a total of 220 runs with his most impressive performance at Old Trafford in a match in which he was the top scorer in the first innings with 77 followed by an 6 for 55 performance with the ball. The latter remains his best bowling figures in Test cricket. During a Test series against South Africa in 2005, Bravo scored his maiden century ‚Äì 107 before getting out to Mark Boucher ‚Äì in the fourth Test in Antigua, but that was overshadowed when he accused South African Graeme Smith of directing a racist comment at him. At the subsequent hearing no evidence could be found and charges were dropped against Smith, who immediately demanded an apology from Bravo. Bravo, backed by the West Indies Cricket Board, refused to do so and received a hail of criticism from an indignant South African press while finding support at home as a human rights campaigner. =Years through injuries= On the West Indies tour of Australia in 2005, Bravo was controversially not picked for the first Test at Brisbane in which the West Indies were beaten convincingly. He was recalled for the second Test in Hobart and made a superb 113, after coming in at a very difficult stage for the West Indies. His innings lifted the West Indies and helped them regain some pride, forcing the Australians to bat for a second time in the match. In the third and final match of the series at Adelaide, he bowled a superb spell in the Australians first innings taking 6 for 84. In West Indies tour of New Zealand in early 2006 Bravo strained his left side in the Twenty20 game at the start of the tour and was unable to bowl but still played in all three tests as a specialist batsman. His selection showed how far he had come in the previous two years and how crucial he had become to the West Indies team. =Comeback in 2006= After a disappointing series in India Bravo returned to top form in the ICC Champions Trophy 2006 when he took 7 wickets at an average of 27.57 and scored 164 runs at an average of 41 although most of the runs were scored in a dead rubber match with England in which he made his first ever ODI century scoring a majestic 112 not out as part of a second wicket stand of 174 with Chris Gayle. His bowling contained some lethal slower-paced yorkers with which he dismissed Michael Clarke and Chris Read. During the Third Test against England at Old Trafford on 9 June 2007, Bravo acted as an emergency wicket-keeper in place of Denesh Ramdin who had gone off for treatment after being hit on the head with the ball. In the same Test he took the wicket of England batsman Kevin Pietersen with a bouncer which struck the batsman's helmet knocking the helmet off of his head onto the stumps and dislodging the bails causing Pietersen to be given out hit wicket. =ICC Campaigns= Bravo played in all of West Indies games at the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies. He had a disappointing World Cup scoring 129 runs at an average of 21.50 and although he took 13 wickets at 27.76 his economy rate was 5.56. Against South Africa he conceded 69 runs off 7 overs including 18 off his first over. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' by Cricinfo for the 2009 T20I World Cup. He was ruled out from the 2011 Cricket World Cup in India due to the knee injury when he slipped at the wicket while bowling to South African batsman on 24 February at Delhi. He was rested for four weeks and could not participate further in the tournament. He played in all of West Indies games at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, which the West Indies won. He played most of the tournament as a batsman as injury prevented him from bowling. For his performances in 2012, he was named in the T20I XI of the year by Cricinfo. In 2014, during a tour of India, Bravo was spokesman for the players during players strike which resulted in the tour being cancelled half way. He was later omitted from the West Indies World Cup squad for the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. The West Indies struggled in his absence, especially in the bowling department. He then played in all of West Indies games at the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India, which the West Indies won. His high quality death bowling is considered to be one of the main reasons that the West Indies won the title. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' by Cricbuzz. =2019 Cricket World Cup= In May 2019, Cricket West Indies (CWI) named him as one of ten reserve players in the West Indies' squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. =Retirement= On 31 January 2015, Bravo announced his retirement from Test cricket. In October 2018, he announced his retirement from international cricket in all formats but will continue to play franchise T20 cricket. In December 2019, Bravo came out of international retirement in preparation for the 2020 T20 World Cup. T20 franchise career =Indian Premier League= Dwayne Bravo played for the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League for the first three seasons. He was picked up by the Chennai Super Kings during 2011 IPL Auctions. He was one of the top performing players in the 2012 IPL playing for Chennai Super Kings scoring 461 runs at an average of 57 with a strike rate of 178. He also performed well in the 2013 IPL playing for Chennai Super Kings, taking 32 wickets at an average of 9.15 to win the Purple Cap and overthrow Albie Morkel to become Chennai Super Kings's leading wicket taker. During IPL 2014 he sustained a shoulder injury in the first match against Kings XI Punjab and was subsequently ruled out of the remaining matches. He launched his music single \\"Chalo Chalo\\" in Chennai on 3 May 2015. He performed well in the 2015 IPL playing for Chennai Super Kings, taking 26 wickets and winning the purple cap for a second time. He is the one of the two men who have won 2 purple caps. On the occasion of the 10-year anniversary of IPL, he was also named in the all- time Cricinfo IPL XI After the suspension of Chennai Super Kings for 2 years, he was bought by Gujarat Lions. Later in 2018 IPL he was retained for 64.0 million by Chennai Super Kings again. In 2019 IPL too, he was again retained by Chennai Super Kings. He didn't put up a very good performance that year, but he impressed with his tight bowling in the death overs. =Pakistan Super League= In 2016 PSL draft, Bravo was picked by Lahore Qalandars in 2016 draft for US$70,000. His team finished last and were disqualified. He also captained the side in the absence of regular captain Azhar Ali. He was retained by Qalandars for 2017 Season but he didn't play in the 2nd season. Dwayne Bravo signed with Peshawar Zalmi in 2018 draft. In 2019 draft he signed with Quetta Gladiators. His team won the tournament for the first time, defeating Peshawar Zalmi in the final. =Other T20 franchises= In May 2018, he was named as one of the ten marquee players for the first edition of the Global T20 Canada cricket tournament. On 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Winnipeg Hawks in the players' draft for the inaugural edition of the tournament. In October 2018, he was named in Paarl Rocks' squad for the first edition of the Mzansi Super League T20 tournament. He was the joint-leading wicket-taker for the team in the tournament, with ten dismissals in six matches. In June 2019, he was selected to play for the Winnipeg Hawks franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. In July 2020, he was named in the Trinbago Knight Riders squad for the 2020 Caribbean Premier League. On 26 August 2020, in the match against the St Lucia Zouks, Bravo became the first bowler to take 500 wickets in T20 cricket, and the first bowler to take 100 wickets in the CPL. Other work In 2016, Bravo released his first single Champion to commemorate West Indies winning the 2016 World T20.http://www.forbesindia.com/article/recliner/champion-dwayne-bravo-packs-a- caribbean-punch/43167/1 The single became a runaway hit in India, topping charts. http://www.forbesindia.com/article/recliner/champion-dwayne-bravo- packs-a-caribbean-punch/43167/1 The release led to rumours of Bravo acting in Bollywood. He responded by saying, \\"Jashoda Madhavji from my team is working on it and given her expertise, a film may just happen. I have been getting offers, but I need to find something that brings out the actor in me and fans can relate to Bravo, the actor, just as they have related to Bravo, the singer.\\"https://indianewengland.com/2016/08/dont-need-actor-now-belong- bollywood-dwayne-bravo/ Records * Along with Jerome Taylor, he set the record (66 runs) for the highest ever 9th wicket partnership in T20Is. *He is one of three players to have scored 1000 runs and taken 50 wickets in each format of the game.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 21, 2002. Set in a retro-futuristic 31st century, the series follows the adventures of the employees of Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company. In this episode, the Planet Express team and most of the main cast of Star Trek: The Original Series face a court-martial after visiting the forbidden planet Omega 3. An existing idea to feature the cast of Star Trek: The Original Series was scrapped and replaced with a new script written by David A. Goodman, after the newly hired writer was identified as the biggest Star Trek fan on the staff. All of the main cast of The Original Series agreed to appear, with the exception of DeForest Kelley - who had died in 1999, although \\"Dr. McCoy\\" did appear, without speaking - and James Doohan, resulting in the creation of a new character called \\"Welshie\\". \\"Where No Fan Has Gone Before\\" was received positively by critics, with praise directed at the various Star Trek homages. The script was nominated for a Nebula Award, losing to The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Plot Philip J. Fry learns that the Star Trek franchise has been forbidden since the series became a worldwide religion in the 2200s; all of its fans were killed during the Star Trek WarsAs opposed to the Star Wars Trek, the \\"vast migration of Star Wars fans\\" and the \\"sacred\\" tapes of its 79 episodesWith only 30 good ones, according to Fry and six movies were burned, with the remaining copies sent to the forbidden planet Omega 3. Outraged, Fry takes Leonard Nimoy's head from the Head Museum and convinces Bender and Leela to join him in a mission to recover the tapes. On Omega 3, they find several original sets from Star Trek, and most of the original cast with new bodies and eternal youth. An energy being named Melllvar explains that he became a Trekkie after watching the discarded tapes over and over again. Melllvar gives Nimoy a body, and orders the actors and the Planet Express crew to participate in a Star Trek convention until the end of time, killing Welshie, a supporting character, to ensure their obedience. While Melllvar forces the cast to perform his fan script, Bender, Leela and Fry escape in the Planet Express Ship. Fry convinces the crew to attack Melllvar to save the actors, but Melllvar destroys the ship's engine as he drags it back to the planet. After seeing the Planet Express crew's attempt to defeat him, Melllvar wonders if they are more worthy of his adoration than the Star Trek cast, and decides to force them to battle to the death. After several minutes of fighting, Melllvar's mother appears and makes him come home for dinner. While he is gone, the two groups combine the engine of the cast's ship with the hull of the Planet Express Ship to escape. To lose enough weight to lift off, the cast jettison their bodies. Melllvar follows the crew into space in a Klingon Bird of Prey. Zapp Brannigan boards the Planet Express Ship and holds a court- martial of the occupants for trespassing on Omega 3. Leela points out that while the court-martial is in progress, Melllvar is still chasing them. Fry convinces Melllvar that he cannot spend his life watching Star Trek, and Melllvar agrees to end the chase, allowing the crew and cast return to Earth. Production William Shatner (pictured left) and Leonard Nimoy (pictured right) recorded their voice work for this episode together. The writer for this episode, David A. Goodman, said that making this episode was a \\"dream come true\\" for many members of the crew including himself. At the time he was hired onto the staff, they were already talking about creating a Star Trek- centric episode. The initial idea was to have a giant Kirk and Spock fighting over New York-New York Hotel and Casino. Executive producer David X. Cohen assigned the writing task to Goodman, as they agreed he was the biggest Trek fan of the group. They agreed to drop the story idea with the giant characters and gave him two weeks to write the script. The deadline was complicated as Goodman had to spend the first week on jury duty, and then broke his ankle. Despite this, he described \\"Where No Fan Has Gone Before\\" as the most fun he has ever had writing a script. After working on Futurama, including this episode, David A. Goodman wrote for Star Trek: Enterprise. Series creator Matt Groening stated that while he is a fan of the Star Trek franchise, he has never seen an episode of The Original Series in its entirety, but has seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Director Pat Shinagawa said that there was a certain amount of jealousy among the crew that she got to work on the episode. All of the living members of the original Star Trek cast agreed to appear in the episode with the exception of James Doohan, whose agent replied, \\"No way.\\" Because of this, the episode's working title was jokingly named \\"We got everybody but Scotty\\" and so Scotty was replaced with \\"Welshie\\". DeForest Kelley was physically portrayed but had no lines due to his death in 1999. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy recorded their lines together, which was unusual as actors usually record solo. Goodman later joined the writing staff of Star Trek: Enterprise. Several designs for the energy being were considered for this episode; however, the final version was decided upon due to a desire to keep the design simple. Shinagawa noted that even so, the final design for Melllvar is more sophisticated than some energy beings featured in the original series. =Cultural references= This episode contains many story elements based on episodes of Star Trek. In the DVD audio commentary, Goodman noted his pride in having included a large number of quotations from The Original Series, particularly those items which he claims \\"the people on the internet\\" had not found on their own. He noted that in \\"Shatner's Log\\", based on Star Treks \\"Captain's log\\", the line \\"The impossible has happened\\" quotes the opening log in \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\". Broadcast and reception Although the episode was not the last episode produced for season four, it was used as the season finale for the fourth broadcast season, being broadcast on April 21, 2002, on Fox in the United States. The episode was subsequently nominated for a Nebula Award in 2004 for best script, but lost to the film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002). Prior to the broadcast, Dusty Saunders previewed the episode for Rocky Mountain News, calling Futurama \\"under-appreciated\\" and that this episode had \\"Lots of fun and fantasy at the expense of the noted sci-fi series.\\" Zack Handlen, while writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode an 'A' grade. He said that the storyline could have been seen as \\"pretty mean-spirited if there wasn't such a clear thread of Trek love running through the episode\\". He felt that having the framing device set during the event rather than afterwards as \\"delightful\\", and that the Star Trek references were both \\"relevant to the story and funny in their own right\\". Andy Wilson reviewed the episode for BigShinyRobot, calling it the \\"greatest animated homage to Trek ever\\" and \\"one of the best episodes of Futurama\\". IGN ranked the episode in tenth place in their list of the top 25 episodes of the series in 2006, calling it \\"ultimate fan service episode\\", but \\"one that any sci-fi fan, Trekker or otherwise, can still enjoy\\". The popularity of this episode combined with the large volume of Star Trek references has made this episode a touchstone among Trekkies according to Chris Baker at Wired.com. This episode, along with \\"Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles\\", was the great moments of the fourth season by David Hofstede in his book 5000 Episodes and No Commercials: The Ultimate Guide to TV Shows on DVD.Hofstede (2006): p. 120 \\"Where No Fan Has Gone Before\\" was included in the Volume 4 release on DVD, including several deleted scenes, which was first released on August 24, 2004, in the United States.

Normally, the lender will set a limit on how much risk it is prepared to take and will set a limit on how much leverage it will permit, and would require the acquired asset to be provided as collateral security for the loan. Leveraging enables gains to be multiplied.Brigham, Eugene F., Fundamentals of Financial Management (1995). On the other hand, losses are also multiplied, and there is a risk that leveraging will result in a loss if financing costs exceed the income from the asset, or the value of the asset falls. Sources Leverage can arise in a number of situations, such as: * securities like options and futures are effectively bets between parties where the principal is implicitly borrowed/lent at interest rates of very short treasury bills.Mock, E. J., R. E. Schultz, R. G. Schultz, and D. H. Shuckett, Basic Financial Management (1968). * equity owners of businesses leverage their investment by having the business borrow a portion of its needed financing. The more it borrows, the less equity it needs, so any profits or losses are shared among a smaller base and are proportionately larger as a result.Grunewald, Adolph E. and Erwin E. Nemmers, Basic Managerial Finance (1970). * businesses leverage their operations by using fixed cost inputs when revenues are expected to be variable. An increase in revenue will result in a larger increase in operating profit. * hedge funds may leverage their assets by financing a portion of their portfolios with the cash proceeds from the short sale of other positions. Risk While leverage magnifies profits when the returns from the asset more than offset the costs of borrowing, leverage may also magnify losses. A corporation that borrows too much money might face bankruptcy or default during a business downturn, while a less-leveraged corporation might survive. An investor who buys a stock on 50% margin will lose 40% if the stock declines 20%.; also in this case the involved subject might be unable to refund the incurred significant total loss. Risk may depend on the volatility in value of collateral assets. Brokers may demand additional funds when the value of securities held declines. Banks may decline to renew mortgages when the value of real estate declines below the debt's principal. Even if cash flows and profits are sufficient to maintain the ongoing borrowing costs, loans may be called-in. This may happen exactly at a time when there is little market liquidity, i.e. a paucity of buyers, and sales by others are depressing prices. It means that as market price falls, leverage goes up in relation to the revised equity value, multiplying losses as prices continue to go down. This can lead to rapid ruin, for even if the underlying asset value decline is mild or temporary the debt-financing may be only short- term, and thus due for immediate repayment. The risk can be mitigated by negotiating the terms of leverage, by maintaining unused capacity for additional borrowing, and by leveraging only liquid assets which may rapidly be converted to cash. There is an implicit assumption in that account, however, which is that the underlying leveraged asset is the same as the unleveraged one. If a company borrows money to modernize, add to its product line or expand internationally, the extra trading profit from the additional diversification might more than offset the additional risk from leverage. Or if an investor uses a fraction of his or her portfolio to margin stock index futures (high risk) and puts the rest in a low-risk money-market fund, he or she might have the same volatility and expected return as an investor in an unlevered low-risk equity-index fund. Or if both long and short positions are held by a pairs-trading stock strategy the matching and off-setting economic leverage may lower overall risk levels. So while adding leverage to a given asset always adds risk, it is not the case that a levered company or investment is always riskier than an unlevered one. In fact, many highly levered hedge funds have less return volatility than unlevered bond funds, and normally heavily indebted low-risk public utilities are usually less risky stocks than unlevered high-risk technology companies. Measuring A good deal of confusion arises in discussions among people who use different definitions of leverage. The term is used differently in investments and corporate finance, and has multiple definitions in each field. =Investments= Accounting leverage is total assets divided by the total assets minus total liabilities.Weston, J. Fred and Eugene F. Brigham, Managerial Finance (1969). Notional leverage is total notional amount of assets plus total notional amount of liabilities divided by equity. Economic leverage is volatility of equity divided by volatility of an unlevered investment in the same assets. To understand the differences, consider the following positions, all funded with $100 of cash equity:Bodie, Zvi, Alex Kane and Alan J. Marcus, Investments, McGraw-Hill/Irwin (June 18, 2008) * Buy $100 of crude oil with money out of pocket. Assets are $100 ($100 of oil), there are no liabilities, and assets minus liabilities equals owners' equity. Accounting leverage is 1 to 1. The notional amount is $100 ($100 of oil), there are no liabilities, and there is $100 of equity, so notional leverage is 1 to 1. The volatility of the equity is equal to the volatility of oil, since oil is the only asset and you own the same amount as your equity, so economic leverage is 1 to 1. * Borrow $100 and buy $200 of crude oil. Assets are $200, liabilities are $100 so accounting leverage is 2 to 1. The notional amount is $200 and equity is $100, so notional leverage is 2 to 1. The volatility of the position is twice the volatility of an unlevered position in the same assets, so economic leverage is 2 to 1. * Buy $100 of a 10-year fixed-rate treasury bond, and enter into a fixed-for-floating 10-year interest rate swap to convert the payments to floating rate. The derivative is off-balance sheet, so it is ignored for accounting leverage. Accounting leverage is therefore 1 to 1. The notional amount of the swap does count for notional leverage, so notional leverage is 2 to 1. The swap removes most of the economic risk of the treasury bond, so economic leverage is near zero. =Abbreviations= * EBIT means Earnings before interest and taxes. * DOL is Degree of Operating Leverage * DFL is Degree of Financial Leverage * DCL is Degree of Combined Leverage * ROE is Return on equity * ROA is Return on assets =Corporate finance= : \\\\mathrm{DOL} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{EBIT\\\\;+\\\\;Fixed\\\\;Costs}}{\\\\mathrm{EBIT}} : \\\\mathrm{DFL} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{EBIT}}{\\\\mathrm{EBIT} - \\\\text{Total Interest Expense}} : \\\\mathrm{DCL} = \\\\text{DOL} \\\\times \\\\text{DFL} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{EBIT} + \\\\text{Fixed Costs}}{\\\\mathrm{EBIT} - \\\\text{Total Interest Expense}} Accounting leverage has the same definition as in investments.Weston, J. Fred and Eugene F. Brigham, Managerial Finance (2010). There are several ways to define operating leverage, the most common.Brigham, Eugene F., Fundamentals of Financial Management (1995) is: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Operating leverage} & = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Revenue} - \\\\text{Variable Cost}}{\\\\text{Revenue} - \\\\text{Variable Cost} - \\\\text{Fixed Cost}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Revenue} - \\\\text{Variable Cost}}{\\\\text{Operating Income}} \\\\end{align} Financial leverage is usually defined as: : \\\\text{Financial leverage}= \\\\frac{\\\\text{Total Debt}}{\\\\text{Shareholders' Equity}} For outsiders, it is hard to calculate operating leverage as fixed and variable costs are usually not disclosed. In an attempt to estimate operating leverage, one can use the percentage change in operating income for a one-percent change in revenue.Damodaran (2011), Applied Corporate Finance, 3rd ed., pp. 132‚Äì133> The product of the two is called Total leverage,Li, Rong-Jen and Glenn V. Henderson, Jr., \\"Combined Leverage and Stock Risk,\\" Quarterly Journal of Business & Finance (Winter 1991), pp. 18‚Äì39. and estimates the percentage change in net income for a one- percent change in revenue.Huffman, Stephen P., \\"The Impact of Degrees of Operating and Financial Leverage on the Systematic Risk of Common Stock: Another Look,\\" Quarterly Journal of Business & Economics (Winter 1989), pp. 83‚Äì100. There are several variants of each of these definitions,Dugan, Michael T., Donald Minyard, and Keith A. Shriver, \\"A Re-examination of the Operating Leverage-Financial Leverage Tradeoff,\\" Quarterly Review of Economics & Finance (Fall 1994), pp. 327‚Äì334. and the financial statements are usually adjusted before the values are computed. Moreover, there are industry-specific conventions that differ somewhat from the treatment above.Darrat, Ali F.d and Tarun K. Mukherjee, \\"Inter-Industry Differences and the Impact of Operating and Financial Leverages on Equity Risk,\\" Review of Financial Economics (Spring 1995), pp. 141‚Äì155. Bank regulation Before the 1980s, quantitative limits on bank leverage were rare. Banks in most countries had a reserve requirement, a fraction of deposits that was required to be held in liquid form, generally precious metals or government notes or deposits. This does not limit leverage. A capital requirement is a fraction of assets that is required to be funded in the form of equity or equity-like securities. Although these two are often confused, they are in fact opposite. A reserve requirement is a fraction of certain liabilities (from the right hand side of the balance sheet) that must be held as a certain kind of asset (from the left hand side of the balance sheet). A capital requirement is a fraction of assets (from the left hand side of the balance sheet) that must be held as a certain kind of liability or equity (from the right hand side of the balance sheet). Before the 1980s, regulators typically imposed judgmental capital requirements, a bank was supposed to be \\"adequately capitalized,\\" but these were not objective rules.Ong, Michael K., The Basel Handbook: A Guide for Financial Practitioners, Risk Books (December 2003) National regulators began imposing formal capital requirements in the 1980s, and by 1988 most large multinational banks were held to the Basel I standard. Basel I categorized assets into five risk buckets, and mandated minimum capital requirements for each. This limits accounting leverage. If a bank is required to hold 8% capital against an asset, that is the same as an accounting leverage limit of 1/.08 or 12.5 to 1.Saita, Francesco, Value at Risk and Bank Capital Management: Risk Adjusted Performances, Capital Management and Capital Allocation Decision Making, Academic Press (February 3, 2007) While Basel I is generally credited with improving bank risk management it suffered from two main defects. It did not require capital for all off-balance sheet risks (there was a clumsy provisions for derivatives, but not for certain other off-balance sheet exposures) and it encouraged banks to pick the riskiest assets in each bucket (for example, the capital requirement was the same for all corporate loans, whether to solid companies or ones near bankruptcy, and the requirement for government loans was zero). Work on Basel II began in the early 1990s and it was implemented in stages beginning in 2005. Basel II attempted to limit economic leverage rather than accounting leverage. It required advanced banks to estimate the risk of their positions and allocate capital accordingly. While this is much more rational in theory, it is more subject to estimation error, both honest and opportunitistic. The poor performance of many banks during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2009 led to calls to reimpose leverage limits, by which most people meant accounting leverage limits, if they understood the distinction at all. However, in view of the problems with Basel I, it seems likely that some hybrid of accounting and notional leverage will be used, and the leverage limits will be imposed in addition to, not instead of, Basel II economic leverage limits.Tarullo, Daniel K., Banking on Basel: The Future of International Financial Regulation, Peterson Institute for International Economics (September 30, 2008) Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 The financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, like many previous financial crises, was blamed in part on \\"excessive leverage\\". * Consumers in the United States and many other developed countries had high levels of debt relative to their wages, and relative to the value of collateral assets. When home prices fell, and debt interest rates reset higher, and business laid off employees, borrowers could no longer afford debt payments, and lenders could not recover their principal by selling collateral. * Financial institutions were highly levered. Lehman Brothers, for example, in its last annual financial statements, showed accounting leverage of 31.4 times ($691 billion in assets divided by $22 billion in stockholders‚Äô equity).Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc Annual Report for year ended November 30, 2007 Bankruptcy examiner Anton R. Valukas determined that the true accounting leverage was higher: it had been understated due to dubious accounting treatments including the so-called repo 105 (allowed by Ernst & Young).Report of Anton R. Valukas, Examiner, to the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, Chapter 11 Case No. 08-13555 (JMP). * Banks' notional leverage was more than twice as high, due to off-balance sheet transactions. At the end of 2007, Lehman had $738 billion of notional derivatives in addition to the assets above, plus significant off-balance sheet exposures to special purpose entities, structured investment vehicles and conduits, plus various lending commitments, contractual payments and contingent obligations. * On the other hand, almost half of Lehman's balance sheet consisted of closely offsetting positions and very-low-risk assets, such as regulatory deposits. The company emphasized \\"net leverage\\", which excluded these assets. On that basis, Lehman held $373 billion of \\"net assets\\" and a \\"net leverage ratio\\" of 16.1. This is not a standardized computation, but it probably corresponds more closely to what most people think of when they hear of a leverage ratio. Use of language Levering has come to be known as \\"leveraging\\", in financial communities; this may have originally been a slang adaptation, since leverage was a noun. However, modern dictionaries (such as Random House Dictionary and Merriam- Webster's Dictionary of Law) refer to its use as a verb, as well.\\"leverage.\\" Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law.

It is the first feature film by the music video directing team The Malloys, after co-directing the surfing documentary Thicker than Water (2000) with musician Jack Johnson. The film presents itself as a parody of 1990s \\"ski school\\" movies and makes a number of references to the film Casablanca. A number of elements of the latter, including plot and famous lines, were incorporated into Out Cold.  Plot  Rick Rambis, best friend Luke, and other friends Anthony, \\"Pig Pen\\", Jenny, Lance and Stumpy, all live and work at a ski resort on Bull Mountain in Alaska. The mountain and resort were founded by Herbert \\"Papa\\" Muntz who loved to drink and ski at the same time until he died doing so. His son, Ted, took over the mountain and plans to sell it to wealthy Colorado ski resort tycoon, John Majors. In addition to being friends, Rick has romantic designs on Jenny, but is held back as he is still getting over his ex, Anna, who mysteriously disappeared after 3 weeks of summer love in Mexico. After arriving at the mountain, John Majors plans to change the mountain name and turn the ski village into a first class resort but seeks Rick's help in getting his rowdy friends in line so as not to scare off his investors. John brings with him to the mountain his daughters, Inga, a Swiss ski bunny, and Anna, Rick's summer fling. After Anna's arrival, Rick then gets drunk and misses his date with Jenny. Later, Anna explains she left Rick in Mexico because she was already engaged and that Rick was the other man. Majors begins to make major changes to the town and mountain, such as changing the dive bar to an upscale club and removing the statue of Papa Muntz from the center of the town. Majors offers Rick a contract to be his new manager and Rick agrees on the condition that his friends all get to stay, but Majors secretly has Ted fire them behind his back. Rick finds out about the firing of his friends and quits his job and races to stop his friends from leaving. Rick gives an inspirational speech about how the mountain is their home and not letting Majors ruin the memory of Papa Muntz, they all grab their snowboards and head for the mountain. The group of friends and Inga then cause bedlam at the festivities and Major is outraged at Rick's betrayal. Rick frees Anna from her father and takes her to an airstrip where Barry, her fianc√©, waits in his plane. He tells Anna what they had in Mexico was special but that he realized she belongs with Barry and Rick watches Anna fly away. The friends defeat Majors and Ted decides he is no longer selling the mountain. Rick asks Jenny out again after revealing he no longer thinks of Anna.  Cast  * Jason London as Rick Rambis * A. J.

This is done by both individual households and by governments and institutions. De-icing and anti-icing Salt brine sprayed and dried on a road surface for anti-icing before a snow storm De-icing is defined as removal of existing snow, ice or frost from a roadway, airport runway, or other surface. It includes both mechanical means, such as plowing or scraping, and chemical means, such as application of salt or other ice-melting chemicals. Anti-icing is treatment with ice-melting chemicals before or during the onset of a storm in order to prevent or delay the formation and adhesion of ice and snow to the surface. Brine, or wetted salt, is usually applied shortly before the beginning of a snowstorm. When properly performed, anti-icing can significantly reduce the amount of salt required and allow easier removal by mechanical methods, including plowing.Cornell Local Roads Program, Snow and Ice Control Operations for Local Highway Officials The de-icing of roads has historically been accomplished by snowplows or specially-designed dump trucks that spread salt, often mixed with sand and gravel, onto slick roads. Rock salt is normally used because it is inexpensive and readily available in large quantities. However, brine freezes at ‚àí18 ¬∞C (0 ¬∞F), and so it is ineffective at these low temperatures. It also has a strong tendency to cause corrosion, rusting the steel used in most vehicles and the rebar in concrete bridges. More recent snowmelters use other salts, such as calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, which not only decrease the freezing point of water to a much lower temperature but also produce an exothermic reaction, whose dissipated heat further aids in melting. In addition, they are somewhat safer for concrete sidewalks, but excess should still be removed. Recently, organic compounds have been developed that reduce the environmental impact associated with salts and that have longer residual effects when spread on roadways, usually in conjunction with salt brines or solids. These compounds are generated as byproducts of agricultural operations, such as sugar beet refining or ethanol distillation.Better Roads- dead link pending resolution with Better Roads magazine A mixture of some selection of these organic compounds with a combination of salts results in a substance that is both more easily spread and more effective at lower temperatures (‚àí34 ¬∞C or ‚àí30 ¬∞F). Since the 1990s, use of liquid chemical melters has been increasing, sprayed on roads by nozzles instead of a spinning spreader used with salts. Liquid melters are more effective at preventing the ice from bonding to the surface than melting through existing ice. Several proprietary products incorporate anti-icing chemicals into the pavement. Verglimit incorporates calcium chloride granules into asphalt pavement. The granules are continually exposed by traffic wear, and release calcium chloride onto the surface. This prevents snow and ice from sticking to the pavement Verglimit SA, Capabilities of Verglimit, http://www.verglimit.eu/en_capabilities.php, Sep 20, 2010, retrieved 12/14/2010 Cargill SafeLane is a proprietary pavement surface treatment that absorbs anti-icing brines, to be released during a storm or other icing event. It also provides a high-friction surface, increasing traction.Cargill, Inc., SafeLane Surface Overlay, http://www.cargillsafelane.com/, retrieved 12/14/2010 A Japanese road sprinkler system. This system combines the mechanical action of the water to remove the snow and the > zero temperature of the water to melt the snow. This system can only be used where ground temperatures do not regularly drop below zero, otherwise sheet ice formation could result (although a continuous water flow would act as an impediment to this). In Niigata, Japan, relatively inexpensive hot water bubbles up through holes in the pavement to melt snow, though this solution is only practical within a city or town. Some individual buildings may melt snow and ice with electric heating elements buried in the pavement, or even on a roof to prevent ice dams on the shingles, or to keep massive chunks of snow and dangerous icicles from collapsing on anyone below. Small areas of pavement can be kept ice-free by circulating heated liquids in embedded piping systems. Clearing by individuals Manual snow removalSnow removal two days after a record- breaking 45 cm of snow falls in Montreal. Most snow removal by individuals is clearance of driveways and walkways. After heavy snowfalls, snow may be removed from roofs to reduce the risk of structural damage due to the weight. In places with light snow, brooms or other light instruments can be used to brush off snow from walks and other surfaces. In regions with more precipitation, snow is commonly removed with snow shovels, a large lightweight shovel used to push snow and lift it, and snow scoops or sleigh shovels, a large and deep hopper-like implement fitted with a wide handle and designed to scoop up a load of snow and slide it on any slippery surface to another location without lifting. Other tools include snow pushers and shovels with one or more wheels. Shovelling entails a considerable amount of physical effort and can strain the back and the heart. Each year many senior citizens and middle aged persons die from heart attacks while shovelling snow.Dangers of Shoveling Snow Snow blowers are often used by people unwilling or unable to perform this labour, people with large driveways or other substantial surfaces and people who live in areas with long lasting winters with large amounts of snowfall. Others may hire a contractor with a plow bearing truck or a shovel.Snow slams area: Slick roads lead to travel troubles - News - Daily Review After a large snowfall, businessmen with plow trucks often drive through cities offering to plow for money. Removing ice is more difficult. Snow blowers are usually ineffective at clearing ice. Picks are sometimes used, but a solid spade can break through most ice. There is always the risk of damaging the pavement with these instruments. Icy areas can be covered with salt or some other substance, bags of which are widely available. A recent technological advance is the snowmelt system that heats the pavement from below and melts snow and ice after a period of time. Such systems are expensive to install and operate and they are not cost effective in areas with very low winter temperatures and large snowfalls. Some governments offer free snow clearing for the elderly and others in need. In some cities, snow clearing for elder and handicapped residents counts towards community service hours assigned as a punishment for minor offences.FHWA Domestic Pedestrian Safety Scanning Tour http://www.cdtcmpo.org/bike/pedsafety.pdf, Sep. 2005, retrieved Dec. 2010 In some places, laws require homeowners to clear snow from the public sidewalk in front of their house, as well as a pathway on their own property to their mailbox. Those who fail to do so, depending on the jurisdiction's laws, may experience fines and may be civilly liable for injuries suffered by another on a surface that they were required to clear. In some jurisdictions, such as New York, private home owners who shovel are held civilly liable for others' injuries incurred by falling in areas that have been shovelled. Cleaning off and freeing one's vehicle is another matter. Some people who need their vehicles will only do barely what is necessary in order to drive the vehicle and remove it from its space. Failure to clear all the snow and ice from a vehicle causes hazards by impairing the driver's visibility, and ice from the roofs of driven vehicles can cause crashes.The rare but deadly danger of flying ice, Minneapolis St. Paul Star Tribune, January 16, 2009, http://www.startribune.com/local/37747909.html?page=1&c;=y In some jurisdictions, motorists who fail to clear snow from their vehicle entirely may be fined.A clean car is safe √ê and legal - NJ.com Others may be more thorough in this process. In some urban residential areas with curbside parking, residents use objects to mark the spaces they dug out so they can reclaim their space upon their return. Some people use a leaf blower to blow off light powder snow from their car. Also, some people use a leaf blower to blow off light powder snow from their driveway, walks and decks. Only works well for very light powder snow.  Clearing by the owners of contiguous lands or buildings  A snow grooming machine at Perisher Ski Resort, Australia In some countries, keeping sidewalks clear and safe in winter is a duty of the owner of the contiguous land or building. The owner can be an individual inhabitant, in case of a family house, but also the municipality, municipal district or their specific organization or a housing co-operative or some other company (especially if some office or industrial object is concerned). Owners of large buildings or building complexes generally have mechanized snow-removal equipment, but individual house owners mostly clean the sidewalk with hand tools. One example of the longstanding debate over the obligation of snow removal comes from the Czech Republic. In Prague, evidence of such a duty is documented since 1838.Pavel Fastr: Z√°kon o pozemn√≠ch komunikac√≠ch s koment√°≈ôem a vyhl√°≈°kou., Praha, Linde, repeated editions since 1997 The decree of the government of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia No. 1/1943 Sb. said that sidewalk cleaning in residential areas of municipalities with more than 5000 inhabitants, of district cities and of other specified municipalities is a duty of the owner or user of the contiguous land. The municipality was empowered to undertake this duty at the expense of the contiguous land owner. The Czechoslovak Road Act No. 135/1961 Sb. (¬ß23) adopted such legal regulations for all municipalities, but municipality offices could modify them. The new Road Act of the Czech Republic, No. 13/1997 Sb. (¬ß9 art. 4) left this enactment in place and stated that maintenance of a road, path, track etc. is an obligation of its owner without any exception. Despite this, ¬ß27 art. 4 attached to the owner of contiguous land the liability for harm caused by defects of cleaning. In its 2002 and 2003 annual reports, the Czech Public Defender of Rights made a claim for there being a discrepancy between the theoretical and the practical interpretations of the act and recommended that an unequivocal formulation be enacted. This discrepancy was repeatedly handled by the courts, and the Supreme Administrative Court on 27 June 2005 and the Constitutional Court on 3 January 2007 each stated that the cleaning duty results indirectly from the stated liability for harm. Those who impugn the duty argued that it is a residue of feudal corv√©e or of the totalitarian Nazi and communist regimes, that nowadays, compulsory labour mandated by law is in conflict with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms and that systematic municipal cleaning is more effective than cleaning by individuals. On 6 December 2007, the Senate of the Czech Republic proposed at the instance of its Constitutional Committee to remove the controversial article from ¬ß27 of the Road Act of 1997. The Czech Government gave support to it by a narrow majority. In a previous vote and after heated debate, the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic had sanctioned this change by a margin of 116 to 31 amongst the 190 members present. Since 16 April 2009, the changes made by Act No. 97/2009 Sb. mandate that sidewalk cleaning is an obligation only of the owner of the walkway or road, i.e. generally the municipality. Despite the abolition of the duty, many people, including its opponents, declared that they will continue the winter cleaning of municipal sidewalks and paths, but instead will do so voluntarily and on their own behalf. As was mentioned during the discussion in the Czech Parliament in a statement by the Czech Association of Cities and Municipalities, a similar duty belongs to owners of contiguous land exists in many other modern countries, e.g. Austria, France, the United States and some cities in Bavaria. Clearing by contractors Clearing a residential driveway in Incline Village, Nevada Hiring a contractor with a winter service vehicle or a shovel. In many high elevation or heavy snow accumulating areas, companies with snow removal equipment offer to provide services to remove the snow. Contractors may work on a per-time basis, full season contract, or will- call status. Per-time service (or per-push) is usually invoiced monthly and customers will be charged for each time services are provided. Some companies will charge per-time and per-inch where the depth of the snow is even taken into account. A full season contract is quoted and paid upfront at the start of the season and services will be provided automatically according to the contracted terms. Terms may sometimes differ between companies. For example, some full season contracts will expire after a certain amount of trips where others are unlimited. And finally, will-call service is where the client makes contact with the snow removal company to initiate a single clearing. This is not an automatic service and charges are usually higher for will-call jobs. Snow removal services may include driveway and parking area snow removal, walkway and deck handwork, and occasionally roof clearing. Contractors use hand shovels, walk behind snowblowers (or snow throwers), truck plows, skid- steers, light-weight tractors, and heavy front-end loaders. Many times, these machines will require use of tire chains to perform their tasks. Snow may be pushed by plowing methods or blown to an area of the property by snowblowers. Contractors may apply sand or salt in some locations to help melt ice accumulations. Many snow removal contractors will require installation of snow poles or snow staking along the driveway. This is to keep equipment out of the landscaping and to help identify the perimeter of an area. Clearing by municipalities Line of horse-drawn wagons hauling snow in New York City, 1908. Cities clear snow on a much larger scale than individuals. Most cities in areas that get regular snowfall maintain a fleet of snow clearing vehicles. The first to be dispatched are gritters who do some plowing but also salt the road. The salt, via freezing point depression, helps melt the snow and ice and also gives vehicles more traction. Later, usually when the snow has ceased falling, snow plows, front end loaders with snowplow attachments, and graders cover every street pushing snow to the side of the road. Salt trucks often then return to deal with any remaining ice and snow. The trucks generally travel much faster than the plows, averaging between 30 and 40 kilometers per hour. Most cities thus have at least twice as many plows as trucks. Smaller narrow body plows, with Caterpillar tracks or huge snow tires salt and clear sidewalks in some cities, but in many others with less snowfall and/or less pedestrian traffic individuals are tasked with clearing the sidewalk in front of their homes. Ecological movements often oppose this use of salt because of the damage it does when it eventually washes off the roads and spreads to the environment in general. Credit for the concept that municipalities should remove snow from public roadways usually goes to Edward N. Hines, a celebrated early 20th century transportation thinker who also was the first to put a painted center line stripe on an automobile-era road. In cities where snow steadily accumulates over the winter it is also necessary to remove the piles of snow that build up on the side of the roads known as windrows or snowbanks. There are a number of methods of doing this. Pulling snow is done when temperatures rise high enough for traffic to melt snow. The windrows are then broken up and spread over the road. Casting is the moving of snow by means of a shovel or plow to nearby public lands. On boulevards or highways winging back is done, which consists of pushing the snow banks further from the road. The most expensive option, but necessary when there are no nearby places to dump the snow, is to haul it away. This is most often done by large self- propelled snowblowers that gather the piles of snow at the side of the road and load it into dump trucks. The snow is then dumped on the outskirts of town, or in a nearby lake, river or harbor. (Some jurisdictions have banned dumping snow into local bodies of water for environmental reasons - modern roads can be contaminated with melting salt, motor oil, and other substances.) Snow melting machines may be cheaper than moving snow, depending on the cost of fuel and the ambient temperature.City of Toronto: Transportation Services - Snow management The windrows created by the plows in residential areas often block driveways and imprison parked cars. The snow pushed there by any plow is a dense, packed version of \\"normal\\" fallen snow. When the temperatures are significantly below freezing this packed snow takes some of the characteristics of solid ice. Its removal is nearly impossible without mechanical means. Recently, windrows created in residential neighborhoods by city operated snow plows have resulted in the snow plow operators being assaulted by angry homeowners. A street plow in Quebec City, Canada The largest roads and highways are the first to be cleared; roads with steep hills or other dangers are also often a priority. Streets used by buses and other mass transit are also often given higher priorities. It often takes many hours, or even days, to cover every street in a city. In some places, a snow emergency will be declared, where automobile owners are instructed to remove their vehicles from the street (or one side of a street). If cars are in the way when the plows come around, they may be hauled away by tow trucks. Some communities have standing snow emergency rules in winter, in which vehicles may not be parked on streets overnight, whether it snows or not. After smaller snow storms only main roads are cleared while residential ones are left to be melted by passing traffic. Decisions on immediate removal versus \\"natural melting\\" can be hard to make because the inconvenience to citizens and the economy in general must be weighed against the immediate effect on the snow removal budget at that particular moment in the season. In large cities with heavy snowfalls like Montreal and Ottawa, the snow clearing expense for each season is an important part of the seasonal public works budget and each snow storm provokes a major logistical operation involving thousands of employees working in shifts 24 hours a day. The effort can vary greatly depending on the amount of snow. Montreal gets about 225 cm of snow each winter and spends more than $158 million Canadian (2013)Montreal 2013 Budget each year to remove it. Toronto, with about 50 per cent more population and 28 per cent more road surface, gets only 125 cm of snow a year and spends about half that.Cost of Snow (December 24, 2004) The higher cost in Montreal is due to the need to perform \\"snow removal\\" as opposed to simple \\"snow clearing\\" necessitated by both the high snowfall amounts and fewer melting days. In Helsinki, Finland, the amount of snow transported from streets and properties to snow dump sites during the winter of 2009‚Äì2010 was 210,000 truckloads, equaling over 3 million cubic meters. Snow removal impacts the design of city infrastructure. Where possible, street boulevards are wider to accommodate the windrows and sidewalks are not right next to the street. Fire hydrants will have tall flags to locate them under the windrows. Reflective traffic lane markers embedded in the roadbed is not possible (or much harder) due to risk of damage by plows. Access to snow dumping locations (e.g. ravines) by heavy equipment is also planned. It is estimated that Canada spends $1 billion annually on snow removal.Ice The employees who do this work are generally the same workers who do road maintenance work during the summer months, but in some US cities garbage trucks are also equipped with plows and used for snow removal. Many smaller US communities sign contracts with insurance companies, under which the insurance company assumes the risk of a heavy winter. The insurance company of course sets the rates such that averaged over time they will make a profit; the town is willing to overpay for snow removal in mild winters in order to avoid the risk of running dramatically over budget in the occasional severe winter. Large organizations such as universities and airports also often have their own mechanized snow clearing force. Public transit systems generally clear bus stops while post offices clear around mail boxes. Railroads have their own snow clearing devices such as rotary snowplows. Airports, with their associated runways, taxiways and ramp areas are an exception to the use of salt, as the metals used in aircraft construction will corrode causing safety issues. Snow dump sites Snow in Helsinki being loaded on truck for transportation to a snow dump site Snow dump site in Tampere. Melting has already begun and mostly sand and dirt is visible. A snow dump site is a location where snow is dumped as a part of the snow removal process. Designated sites are sometimes required to prevent water and ground pollution because the snow collected on roads typically contain a variety of grit, de-icing chemicals, vehicle fluids, engine emissions, and litter. Some pollutants become diluted and wash away with the melt-water and some concentrate at the dump site.\\"Evaluation of Snow Disposal into Near Shore Marine Environments\\" Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. June 2006. https://dec.alaska.gov/water/wnpspc/stormwater/docs/adec_snow_disposal_evaluation..htm.pdf Dumping into fresh water is \\"...almost universally prohibited due to the serious impact that deicer salts can have on freshwater aquatic life.\\" In the United States dumping snow into water bodies is not specifically prohibited by the Clean Water Act or the Ocean Dumping Act. The states and local governments determine their own dumping policies. Snow dump site selection is based on the availability of suitable land and pollution prevention factors that may include distances from lakes and streams, installation of silt fences, soil and aquifer type, and other factors. Some sites may use filters and settling ponds to help prevent the pollution from spreading. Occasionally an excessive amount of snow must be dumped and is sometimes allowed to be legally dumped into water bodies on an \\"emergency only\\" basis. Surface treatments The surface is treated primarily by snow removal. Roads are also treated by spreading various materials on the surface. These materials generally fall into two categories: chemical and inert. Chemical (including salt) distribution induces freezing-point depression, causing ice and snow to melt at a lower temperature. Chemical treatment can be applied as a preventive measure and/or after snowfall. Inert materials (i.e. sand, brash, slag) make the surface irregular to improve traction. Both types can be applied together, but the inert materials tend to lower traction once the snow and ice has melted. Chemical treatment materials include: * Sodium chloride (common table salt, NaCl) * Calcium chloride (CaCl2) * Potassium chloride (KCl) * Magnesium chloride (MgCl2) * Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) * Ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2SO4] * Potassium acetate (CH3COOK) * Urea [(NH2)2CO] * Propylene glycol (C3H8O2) * Calcium magnesium acetate (C4H6O2Ca and C4H6O2Mg) * Sodium ferrocyanide (hydrous, Na4Fe(CN)6‚Ä¢10H2O) * Methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside (C7H14O6) Wrightwood Forumalpha-D-Methylglucoside - 97-30-3 - Catalog of Chemical Suppliers In the European Union, 98% of chemical treatment materials used in 2000 were sodium chloride in various forms. It is effective down to ‚àí5 ¬∞C, at the most ‚àí7 ¬∞C. For colder temperatures, calcium chloride (CaCl2) is added to NaCl in some countries, but deployment is limited as it costs about 6 times as much as sodium chloride. Other substances were used rarely and experimentally. Alternative substances (urea, alcohols, glycols) are often used at airports.Karel Melcher: Posypov√© materi√°ly pro zimn√≠ √∫dr≈æbu komunikac√≠ v ƒåR a v zem√≠ch EU (Winter road maintenance spreadings in the Czech Republic and in EU countries), Ekolist.cz, 3. 12. 2001 In recent years, Geomelt, a combination of salt brine and beet juice that is otherwise considered a waste product has been used for pretreatment. In Wisconsin, USA, surplus brine from cheese making has been used for this purpose. Inert spreadings can be: * sand * brash, rubble, crushed slag, etc. * slag * wood ash (for household use only) * sawdust The choice of treatment may include consideration of the effect on vegetation, pets and other animals, the local watershed, and effectiveness with regard to speed and temperature. Some chemicals can degrade concrete, metals, and other materials. The resulting meltwater and slush can cause frost heaving if it re-freezes, which can also damage pavement. Inert materials can damage vehicles and create dust. As an example, in the Czech Republic during the winter season of 2000/2001, net material expenditure for road treatment was: 168 000 tonnes of salt (mostly NaCl), 348 000 tonnes of sand and crushed stone and 91 000 tonnes of other materials like slag. In Ireland, the annual expenditure of salt was 30 000 tonnes. Switzerland reports their annual expenditure as 600 grammes of salt to every square metre of roads on average. =Side effects= De-icing chemicals and inert materials need to be selected and applied with care. Chemicals may react with infrastructure, the environment, and vehicles. Chlorides corrode steel and aluminum in reinforced concrete, structures and vehicles. Acetates can cause asphalt stripping, weakening the bond between asphalt binder and aggregate. Sand and grit can clog pavement joints and cracks, preventing pavement from expanding in the summer and increasing stress in the pavement. Salts can be toxic to plants and aquatic life, including the trees lining the side of the roads. Sand can alter aquatic habitats where roads are near streams and lakes. Acetates can reduce oxygen levels in smaller water bodies, stressing aquatic animal life. Sand can be ground by tires into very fine particulate matter and become airborne, contributing to air pollution.

A naval aviator, he held important aviation- related commands both at sea and on shore from the 1920s onward. He also served as Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy. Early life and career Fitch was born in Saint Ignace, Michigan, on June 11, 1883. He entered the U.S. Naval Academy in the summer of 1902 and graduated on February 12, 1906. After serving the two years of sea duty then required by law before being commissioned in the armored cruiser and the torpedo boat Fitch became as ensign on February 13, 1908 and served afloat in and before receiving instruction in torpedoes at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island, in the school conducted on board the old cruiser . Upon completion of the torpedo course, Fitch helped to fit out the battleship , which commissioned on April 4, 1910 before returning to Annapolis for consecutive tours of duty at the Naval Academy, first as assistant discipline officer between 1911 and 1912 and later as an instructor of physical training from 1912 to 1913. Service in the destroyers and followed before he received his first sea command, the destroyer , with the 2nd Division, Reserve Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet. After serving on the staff of the Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, Fitch assumed command of the yacht in January 1915, with additional duty as aide to the Commander in Chief. World War I and afterward Relieved of command of Yankton shortly after the United States entered World War I in the spring of 1917, Fitch continued his staff duties for another five months before joining to serve as her gunnery officer for the remainder of hostilities, as that dreadnought operated with the 6th Battle Squadron, Grand Fleet. After the armistice, Fitch again served at the Naval Academy once more before becoming, concurrently, inspector of ordnance in charge of the Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot in Hingham, MA, and naval inspector of ordnance in charge at the Naval Coaling Station, Frenchman Bay, Maine. From August 1920, Fitch commanded a division of fast minelayers, while also commanding in turn and . Detached from Mahan in December 1922, Fitch served at Rio de Janeiro until March 1927 as a member of the United States mission to Brazil before reporting back to the Navy Department for a brief tour of duty in Washington, D.C. Going to sea as executive officer of in May 1927, Fitch assumed command of (a type of ship sometimes known uncomplimentarily as a \\"beef boat\\") in November of that year. Aviation He reported for aviation instruction at the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, in June 1929 and there won his wings as a naval aviator on February 4, 1930. Following brief duty at NAS San Diego, California, Fitch assumed command of the USS in the spring of 1930. Relieved from that billet a little over a year later (July 1931), he then began a year as commanding officer of the Navy's first aircraft carrier, . After commanding NAS Hampton Roads, Virginia, until June 1935 Fitch reported as chief of staff to Commander, Aircraft, Battle Force, and remained in that billet until assuming command of in April 1936. Subsequently, attending the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island, from June 1937 to May 1938, Fitch completed the senior course there before assuming command of NAS Pensacola, in June 1938. In the spring of 1940, he took over the reins of Patrol Wing 2, based at Pearl Harbor, and seven months later, broke his flag in as Commander, Carrier Division 1. The outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific in December 1941 thus found Fitch one of the most experienced carrier commanders afloat. World War II Fitch's flagship, Saratoga, figured prominently in the abortive attempt to reinforce Wake Island in December 1941 and was later torpedoed off Oahu in late January 1942, seriously cutting American carrier strength in the Pacific at a critical period. Rear Admiral Fitch relieved Vice Admiral Wilson Brown on April 3, 1942, breaking his flag in Lexington, his former command. During the Battle of the Coral Sea, Fitch served as the Commander Task Group 17.5, consisting of \\"Lady Lex\\" and the , and was named Officer in Tactical Command (O.T.C.) by Task Force commander Admiral Frank J. Fletcher. That engagement, the first in history where neither side came within surface gun range of the other, effectively stopped the Japanese thrust at the strategic Port Moresby, but resulted in the first loss of an American aircraft carrier in the war-- the USS Lexington, sunk on May 8, 1942. The admiral then shifted his flag to , which was also flagship of Task Force 17 (TF 17). Fitch together with Captain Frederick C. Sherman and the Lexington's executive officer, Commander Morton T. Seligman, visited \\"Lady Lex\\"'s wounded in Minneapolis' sickbay--an action that \\"contributed in no small measure to the patients' well-being.\\" For the leadership he exhibited during the Battle of the Coral Sea, Fitch was awarded his first Distinguished Service Medal. He again broke his flag in his former flagship, Saratoga, but the task group formed around that ship arrived too late to take part in the pivotal Battle of Midway. Vice Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch, USN, Commander, Aircraft, South Pacific Force, boards a PBY-5A aircraft at Guadalcanal (right). c.1943 On September 20, 1942, six weeks after the first American amphibious operation of the war got underway at Guadalcanal, Fitch assumed command of Aircraft, South Pacific Force. Not a desk-bound admiral, he carried out numerous, hazardous flights into the combat zones, inspecting air activities incident to the selection of bases for projected operations. For these, he received a Distinguished Flying Cross. Under Fitch's command, AirSoPac--ultimately encompassing not only Navy but Army, Marine Corps, and Royal New Zealand air units--achieved great success in aiding the Allied campaign in the South Pacific. Fitch's planes protected Allied shipping, providing vital air cover that strongly assisted the Allies in challenging, and ultimately defeating, the Japanese in the Solomons. In addition, his aircraft performed essential reconnaissance missions, spotting enemy warships prior to the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands in October 1942 and during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942. Later, Fitch oversaw the early experiments in conducting night bombing utilizing radar (a concept which paid great dividends in interdicting Japanese shipping) and encouraged the use of specially modified aircraft to obtain photographic intelligence. In addition, for his skillful coordination of the Allied air effort in that area of the world Fitch received a gold star in lieu of a second Distinguished Service Medal. Fitch returned to Washington in the summer of 1944 and became the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air). He skillfully and efficiently directed the aeronautical organization of the Navy, oversaw efforts to assure the readiness and deployment of air units, and planned all of the related logistics measures. For these efforts he received the Legion of Merit. Post- war service Vice Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch, USN, Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy; With Mrs. Gwyneth Fitch, in the Superintendent's House, Annapolis, Maryland, October 1945. After V-J Day, Vice Admiral Fitch assumed duty as the Superintendent of the Naval Academy on August 16, 1945 and held that post until January 15, 1947, with collateral duty as Commandant, Severn River Command. The first aviator to head the Naval Academy, Fitch was instrumental in establishing the Department of Aeronautics, authorized by the Navy on November 28, 1945. Subsequent to heading the Academy, Fitch served briefly in the Office of the Undersecretary of the Navy before becoming the senior member of the Naval Clemency and Prison Inspection Board in March 1947. He was so serving when he retired from the Navy and was relieved of all active duty on July 1, 1947. Admiral Fitch died due to a heart ailment combined with a bout with pneumonia in Newcastle, Maine his adopted state, on May 22, 1978 shortly before his 95th birthday. Namesake In 1981, the U.S. Navy guided- missile frigate was named in Admiral Fitchs honor. The main road to the former NAS Brunswick, is named Admiral Fitch Avenue in his honor.

August 1909 Providence and Worcester GE Locomotive #4006 seen in Plainfield, CT The P&W; was incorporated in Massachusetts as the Providence and Worcester Railway on March 12, 1844, and as the Providence and Worcester Railroad in Rhode Island in May 1844. The two companies were merged November 25, 1845 as the Providence and Worcester Railroad. The company bought the Blackstone Canal, also running between Providence and Worcester, and began construction, partly on its banks, in 1845.PW history The line opened in two sections, the part south of Millville on September 27, 1847, and the rest on October 20. The line from Providence to Central Falls was shared with the Boston and Providence Railroad, which at the same time built a connection from its old line (ending in East Providence) over to the P&W.; On July 1, 1892, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NH) leased the P&W; for 99 years. Long distance passenger trains, pooled by the NH and the Boston and Maine Railroad, the Bar Harbor Express and the State of Maine Express, bound for Maine on Boston-bypassing routes, traveled on the line until 1960.Ronald Dale Karr, 'The Rail Lines of Southern New England,' Pepperell Massachusetts, 2005, pp. 140-41 The New Haven merged into Penn Central on January 1, 1969. On April 6, 1970, the P&W; announced its intention to separate from the merger. After a legal battle, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the request on August 25, 1972, and, on November 2, Penn Central signed the agreement, effective December 30. The P&W; cancelled the lease on February 3, 1973. Since then, the P&W; has taken over many other lines from the former Penn Central in addition to several from the Boston and Maine Railroad. On March 17, 2013, a freight derailed in New Haven, Connecticut, blocking Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. On August 15, 2016, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (G&W;) announced that it will buy Providence and Worcester Railroad Company for $25.00 per share, or approximately $126 Million. The acquisition was completed on November 1, 2016, and the Surface Transportation Board approved the acquisition on December 16, 2016.STB approves G&W;'s acquisition of Providence & Worcester =Branches= The East Providence Branch Railroad was the only branch built by the P&W.; Chartered in 1874 and opened in 1875, it split from the main line at Valley Falls and ran southeast and south, clipping the corner of Attleboro, Massachusetts and running through Pawtucket, and East Providence crossing both the Boston and Providence Railroad and the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad, and ending at the Wilkes-Barre Pier. The East Providence Branch was also the P&W;'s only branch when it was leased to the NYNH&H;, but previously it had leased several other railroads. The Milford and Woonsocket Railroad was incorporated in 1855 and opened in 1868 from Milford to Bellingham. Soon after, the P&W; leased it, despite it not being connected directly to the P&W.; The Hopkinton Railway was leased in 1870 and opened in 1872, continuing the M&W; north from Milford to Ashland. It too was leased to the P&W;, on completion. Both leases expired in 1883 and were not renewed. The M&W; bought the Hopkinton in 1884, and in 1897 the New England Railroad leased them, with a direct connection at Milford.

Miller, Dan Bornstein, and others at Electric Communities in 1997. E is mainly descended from the concurrent language Joule and from Original-E, a set of extensions to Java for secure distributed programming. E combines message-based computation with Java-like syntax. A concurrency model based on event loops and promises ensures that deadlock can never occur. Philosophy The E language is designed with secure computing in mind; this is accomplished chiefly by strict adherence to the object-oriented computing model, which in its pure form has properties that support secure computing. The E language and its standard library employ a capability-based design philosophy throughout in order to help programmers build secure software and to enable software components to co-operate even if they don't fully trust each other. In E, object references serve as capabilities, hence capabilities add no computational or conceptual overhead costs. The language syntax is designed to be easy for people to audit for security flaws. For example, lexical scoping limits the amount of code that has to be examined for its effects on a given variable. As another example, the language uses the  operator for comparison and the := operator for assignment; to avoid the possibility of confusion, there is no = operator. Computational model In E, all values are objects and computation is performed by sending messages to objects. Each object belongs to a vat (analogous to a process). Each vat has a single thread of execution, a stack frame, and an event queue. Distributed programming is just a matter of sending messages to remote objects (objects in other vats). All communication with remote parties is encrypted by the E runtime. Arriving messages are placed into the vat's event queue; the vat's event loop processes the incoming messages one by one in order of arrival. E has two ways of sending messages: the immediate call and the eventual send. An immediate call is just like a typical function or method call in a non- concurrent language: the sender waits until the receiver finishes and returns a value. An eventual send sends the message while producing a placeholder for the result called a promise. The sender proceeds immediately with the promise. Later, when the receiver finishes and yields a result, the promise resolves to the result. Since only eventual sends are allowed when communicating with remote objects, deadlocks cannot happen. In distributed systems, the promise mechanism also minimizes delays caused by network latency. Syntax and examples E's syntax is most similar to Java, though it also bears some resemblance to Python and Pascal. Variables are dynamically typed and lexically scoped. Unlike Java or Python, however, E is composed entirely of expressions. Here is an extremely simple E program: println(\\"Hello, world!\\") Here is a recursive function for computing the factorial of a number, written in E. Functions are defined using the def keyword. def factorial(n :int) :int { if (n  1) { return 1 } else if (n > 0) { return n * factorial(n-1) } else { throw(\\"invalid argument to factorial: \\"+n) } } In the first line, :int is a guard that constrains the argument and result of the function. A guard is not quite the same thing as a type declaration; guards are optional and can specify constraints. The first :int ensures that the body of the function will only have to handle an integer argument. Without the second :int above, the function would not be able to return a value. Being able to see up front that information escapes out of the function is helpful for security auditing. Since E is intended to support secure co-operation, the canonical example for E programs is the mint, a simple electronic money system in just a few lines of E. The following code defines a function that makes mints, where each mint has its own currency. Each mint can make purses that hold its currency, and any holder of two purses of the same currency can securely transfer money between the purses. By quick examination of the source code, an E programmer can easily verify that only mints may change the amount of money in circulation, that money can only be created and not destroyed, that mints can only create money of their own currency, and that only the holder of a purse can change its balance. def makeMint(name) :any { def [sealer, unsealer] := makeBrandPair(name) def mint { to makePurse(var balance :(int >= 0)) :any { def decr(amount :(0..balance)) :void { balance -= amount } def purse { to getBalance() :int { return balance } to sprout() :any { return mint.makePurse(0) } to getDecr() :any { return sealer.seal(decr) } to deposit(amount :int, src) :void { unsealer.unseal(src.getDecr())(amount) balance += amount } } return purse } } return mint } Objects in E are defined with the def keyword, and within the object definition, the to keyword begins each method. The guard expressions in this example illustrate how to specify a value constraint (as in :(int >= 0) or :(0..balance)). The mint example makes use of a built-in mechanism called a sealer. The function makeBrandPair creates two associated objects, a sealer and an unsealer, such that the sealer can seal an object in a box and the unsealer is the only object that can retrieve the contents of the box. See the E website for a more detailed explanation of this money example.

It is filled by water flowing in from the larger Lake Alexandrina at its mouth near Narrung. It is separated on the south by the Narrung Peninsula from the salt- water Coorong. The only major town on the lake is Meningie. Lakes Alexandrina and Albert are together known as the Lower Lakes. Naming of lake The lake was named after Prince Albert, the Consort of Queen Victoria, by George Gawler, the Governor of South Australia. Tourism Two pelicans on Lake Albert at Meningie Lake Albert is visited regularly by people travelling to and from Melbourne, the Limestone Coast, the Coorong National Park, Tailem Bend, Murray Bridge, and Adelaide. Visitors enjoy fishing, camping, bushwalking, 4WD tracks, bird watching and water sports. Water problems Because there are no significant tributaries and a high evaporation rate, Lake Albert is saltier than Lake Alexandrina. It is also smaller and not as deep, but it is more protected from the elements. In 2008, water levels in Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert became so low that large quantities of acid sulphate soils started to form. The possibility of flooding the lake with seawater to prevent acidification was raised, and tension remains between South Australia and the upstream states over how to share the dwindling supply of water. To this day the lake remains at significant risk of water loss and high salinity. Flora and fauna =Birds= Lake Albert supports critically endangered orange-bellied parrots, endangered Australasian bitterns, vulnerable fairy terns, as well as over 1% of the world populations of Cape Barren geese, Australian shelducks, great cormorants and sharp-tailed sandpipers.

It was built by the Herschell-Spillman Company of Tonawanda, New York in 1911, and it is one of the few antique carousels left in the United States. Before arriving at Tilden in 1948, the carousel had seen service at amusement parks in San Bernardino, Ocean Beach, and Los Angeles.http://www.cruise- addicts.com/forums/f26/fun-after-brunch-97-yr-old-carousel-pics-134204/ It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Merry-Go-Round is owned by the East Bay Regional Park District.  History  The Tilden Park Merry-Go-Round originally operated from 1912-1916 at a trolley park at Urbita Springs, a lake that no longer exists in San Bernardino. The ride operated for a short time in San Diego County before being placed in storage. From 1935-1937 it operated at Griffith Park in Los Angeles before being replaced with the current Griffith Park Merry-Go-Round. In 1947, East Bay Regional Park District General Manager Richard Walpole visited Griffith Park and was impressed with their revenue producing concessions, including the Merry-Go- Round. The Merry-Go-Round operators in Griffith Park, the Davis family, were convinced by Walpole to move the ride that had been in storage and open it in Tilden Park. Ross Davis and his son John opened the Merry-Go-Round on May 29, 1948 at its current location. In 1950, the Merry-Go-Round was expanded from a three-row machine to its current configuration as a four-row machine. The inside row of horses are all cast aluminum figures in contrast to the hand- carved poplar figures on the rest of the Merry-Go-Round. At the time of the reconfiguration, the original rounding boards were replaced with the white rounding boards seen today. The vignette paintings on the rounding boards were also painted in 1950. While major mechanical overhauls have taken place over the years, including in 2008, much of the original machine remains intact. The machine is still operated using a trolley car throttle and a manual handbrake system. The original 7-1/2 horsepower Westinghouse electric motor still drives the Merry-Go-Round.  Current Operations  The Merry-Go-Round is generally open weekends year-round and weekdays from Memorial Day to Labor Day along with Spring Break. Hours are normally 11am-5pm except summer weekends when the ride closes at 6pm. Additionally, the Merry-Go-Round is open for a night time Christmas event from Thanksgiving to Christmas. A food concession stand operates adjacent to the Merry-Go-Round selling drinks, lunch items, ice cream, cotton candy, and popcorn among other items. The Merry-Go-Round is accessible on weekends by AC Transit bus line 67, Lake Anza/Merry-Go-Round stop.  Restoration  The Tilden Park Merry-Go-Round sea monster after being repainted in November 2015. Upon acquiring the Merry-Go-Round in the 1970s, the East Bay Regional Park District hired a team of artists to restore the animals, spinning tub, and chariots. The ride was painted in the color palette that exists today, taking cues from the surrounding parklands. In 2008, the Merry-Go-Round was closed for an extensive mechanical overhaul that included the remodeling of the building to add weather proof doors and windows. The aging wooden platform deck was replaced with a custom milled, vertical grain platform deck that is treated with a clear protective coat. A full overhaul of the North Tonawanda Band Organ at the center of the Merry-Go-Round was performed, however the band organ was not yet operating as of March 2016. The full project cost $700,000. In November 2015, all Merry-Go-Round animals, spinning tub, and chariots were repainted in the 1970s color palette, the project included artists from the 1970s restoration. The 2015 project was a collaboration of Hawk's Eye Studio, Sycamore Concessions, and the East Bay Regional Park District.  Filmography  Before being relocated to Tilden Park, the carousel was in So Ends Our Night (1941). The Merry-Go-Round was used as a film location for Remember Me (2016) featuring Rita Moreno and Steve Goldbloom.

The company designs, markets, and licenses many product lines worldwide, including products sold, and sometimes licensed, under the brand name G Clef, an homage to Emerson's logo. History =1915‚Äì1920= Emerson Radio Corp. was incorporated in 1915 as Emerson Phonograph Co. (NAICS: 421620 Consumer Electronics Wholesaling), based in New York City, by an early recording engineer and executive, Victor Hugo Emerson, who was at one time employed by Columbia Records. The first factories were opened in Chicago and Boston in 1920. In December of that year, the company fell victim to the sales slump which affected the entire phonograph industry caused by the post-World War I recession and the growth of the rapidly expanding commercial radio industry in the early 1920s. The company quickly went from the self-claimed third largest US record manufacturer into receivership. =1921‚Äì1940= In 1922 Emerson Phonograph Co. passed into the hands of Benjamin Abrams \\"The Business Biography of Benjamin Abrams\\" and Rudolph Kanarak. Abrams, a phonograph and record salesman, along with his two brothers, ran the company and renamed it Emerson Radio & Phonograph Corp in 1924 after entering the radio business. The company's phonograph record interests were subsequently sold. Although Emerson introduced the first radio-phonograph combination sold in the United States, the company remained relatively obscure until 1932, when, during the Great Depression, it introduced the \\"peewee\\" radio (see \\"Historical Products\\" below).\\"The Baby Radio,\\" Fortune, July 1933, pp. 64‚Äì65. =1941‚Äì1950= Emerson Radio & Phonograph converted to military production for World War II in 1942, when it held one-sixth of the U.S. radio market. In 1943, it became a public corporation, when it offered over 40 percent of its stock to the public for $12 a share. In 1947, among its first post-war products, Emerson offered a television set with a 10-inch tube.\\"Steady Expansion Seen in Television,\\" New York Times, July 11, 1947, p. 23. Although its ending retail price was nearly equal to a month's salary for the average working American, it put Emerson at the lower end of the market. However, between fiscal 1948 and 1950, the high demand for television allowed Emerson to more than double its sales. Its net income reached a record of $6.5 million in fiscal 1950, with sales of $74.2 million. =1951‚Äì1960= In 1953 Emerson Radio and Phonograph purchased Quiet Heet Corp., which entered the company into air conditioning. Although radio represented only 15 percent of Emerson's revenue by 1954,\\"In Tune with Emerson,\\" Forbes, June 15, 1954, pp. 22‚Äì23. the company credited itself as creating the firsts of the clock radio, self- powered radio, and transistorized pocket radio; production of tape recorders began in 1955. Emerson Radio and Phonograph paid $6 million to purchase the consumer products division of DuMont Laboratories in 1958.\\"Emerson Radio to Buy DuMont Laboratories Consumer Products Unit\\", Wall Street Journal, July 7, 1958, p. 13 With this acquisition, a higher-priced line of television sets, phonographs and high-fidelity and stereo instruments, along with the DuMont trademark was added to Emerson's products. However, by this time, the US television market was saturated, and many customers who were in need of another set were waiting for color television instead of buying a replacement. Sales fell from $87.4 million in fiscal 1955 to $73.9 million in fiscal 1956, when the company earned only $84,852. A cost-cutting campaign by Abrams rebounded net income which reached $2.7 million in fiscal 1959 on sales of $67.4 million. In fiscal 1964 (Emerson's last full year of independent operation) it earned $2.1 million on sales of $68.2 million.Zipser, Alfred R., \\"Salesman Turns to Cost Cutting,\\" New York Times, May 10, 1959, Sec. 3, p. 25. =1961‚Äì1980= In 1965 the company acquired the Pilot Radio Corp. from Jerrold Corp. Later in 1965 Emerson Radio and Phonograph was purchased for approximately $62 million in cash and stock by National Union Electric Corp., a diversified manufacturer. Its line of Quiet Kool air conditioners became a separate National Union Electric division. This company continued to produce radios, television sets and phonographs distributed under the Emerson and DuMont names and hi-fi equipment under the Pilot name.Smith, Gene, \\"Personality: Expansion Through Mergers,\\" New York Times, July 3, 1966, Sec. 3, p. 3. Between 1967 and 1971 the National Union Electric division lost about $27 million due to too little volume to cover costs. The division contracted out the manufacturing of television sets and some other home entertainment products to Admiral Corp., and laid-off 1,800 employees. In addition to importing some of its home entertainment products from the Far East, Emerson continued to be responsible for design, engineering, and marketing. In late 1972 National Union Electric announced that Emerson was discontinuing distribution of television sets and other home entertainment products. In 1973 Emerson sold its license for marketing products under the Emerson name to Major Electronics Corp. Founded in 1948 by Melvin Lane and incorporated in 1956, this Brooklyn-based company originally made children's phonographs.\\"Emerson and DuMont Will Phase-Out Home Electronics,\\" Merchandising Week, January 1, 1973, p. 15. The company later diversified into the production and sale of a broad line of low-priced home entertainment products that included stereos, radios, and clock radios. In 1971 Major also began importing low-cost radios. By 1975 the company was only manufacturing portable phonographs. In 1976 the company moved its headquarters to Secaucus, New Jersey, and changed its name to Emerson Radio Corp. in 1977. Sales rose from $11.5 million in fiscal 1975 to $49.2 million in fiscal 1978, the year in which phonographs, radios, tape recorders and players, compact stereos, digital clock radios, and other low to medium-priced electronic equipment was being imported, assembled, and marketed, primarily under the Emerson name. Approximately 60 percent of its components were being imported from the Far East and 20 percent from each Great Britain and domestically, and assembled in either Secaucus or Sun Valley, California. In 1979, Emerson began selling Heart Aid, after purchasing a large portion of Cardiac Resuscitator Corp., a near-bankrupt company. Emerson spent heavily to develop and produce both an improved Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and a pacemaker. In addition, the company took an 18 percent share in a developer of Computerized Axial Tomographic (CAT) scanners. Because this line of products never made money, Emerson disposed of its holdings in them between 1987-88. Emerson Radio dropped its last U.S.-made product, the phonograph line, in 1980 because it became unprofitable due to rising labor costs. Despite harsh competition, Emerson Radio raised its sales and earnings in fiscal 1980 to $81.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Their plan was to have their suppliers (mainly in Taiwan and South Korea) imitate Sony and Panasonic audio/video products and then sell them at a lower price. =1981‚Äì1990= Sales increased from $94.8 million in fiscal 1983 to $181.6 million in fiscal 1984, when net income came to $9.1 millionMonte, Stevens R., \\"Emerson Radio Corporation,\\" Wall Street Transcript, July 2, 1984, p. 74,453, and September 10, 1984, pp. 75,197-98. because of the company's reintroduction of television sets in 1983. Emerson purchased sets from Goldstar Electric Co. (AKA LG Electronics), a South Korean company, but sold them at a higher price point. In 1984, Emerson signed a 10-year contract with Orion Electric to produce a line of VCRs to its existing product lineup.Mehler, Mark, \\"Every Which Way Is Up for Emerson,\\" Financial World, November 14‚Äì27, 1984, pp. 86‚Äì87. In 1985, a compact disc player and microwave oven were introduced causing sales to once again double in fiscal 1985 to $357.5 million, and net income rose to $13.3 million. TV sets and VCR's accounted for two-thirds of sales that year.Roberts, Johnnie L., \\"Emerson Radio, After a Timely Entry into Video, Basks in Electronics Boom,\\" Wall Street Journal, June 11, 1985, p. 16. Later that year, Emerson Radio moved its headquarters to North Bergen, New Jersey, and acquired H. H. Scott, Inc., a company that manufactured high-fidelity audio and visual equipment. Products were sold under the Scott name until 1991, the year the line was discontinued. In 1986 Emerson began importing and marketing compact refrigerators and Hi-Fi stereo VHS VCRs. Camcorders, telephones, and answering machines were added to its product line in fiscal 1988. In 1990 personal computers and facsimile machines were added for a major roll-out to more than 500 Wal-Mart stores.Gault, Ylonda, \\"Besieged Emerson Tuning New Markets,\\" Crain's New York Business, September 10, 1990, p. 6. In 1992 sales reached a peak of $891.4 million, but net income was only $10.4 million. Emerson's addition of personal computers resulted in a $150 million loss for the company. That coupled with the recession that began in 1990 brought the company's total loss to $37.5 million in the last nine months of the year. Shares of stock fell as low as $2, compared to the high of $12.75 in 1987. Several shareholder lawsuits charged some Emerson directors and officials with breach of fiduciary duty and self-dealing. Emerson also fell into technical default on its long-term debt of $55.4 million at the end of the year. In 1988, Emerson Radio was sold to Panasonic. =1991‚Äì2000= The Emerson Radio logo that was used prior to 2006. The current logo now uses a futuristic version with a slanted G clef logo and \\"Emerson\\" in an electrified, neon-type font (as seen on the website). Fidenas Investment Ltd., a Swiss firm based in the Bahamas, began purchasing shares of Emerson Radio stock in 1989. It held a 20 percent stake (more than that held by Stephen and William Lane) by 1992, when they began a takeover attempt. The Lane brothers were seeking to restructure $180 million in debt, but conceded defeat in June 1992.\\"Emerson Radio's Plan Would Give Control to a Swiss Company,\\" Wall Street Journal, October 4, 1993, p. A9A. Emerson's financial situation worsened, and in fiscal 1993 the company incurred a loss of $56 million on sales of $741.4 million. When the company filed for bankruptcy in October 1993, Emerson had been in default on $223 million in debt for the previous two years.Bergman, Robert J., \\"Emerson Radio Cedes Control, Ends Bitter Proxy Fight,\\" Wall Street Journal, June 26, 1992, p. B4. In 1994, the company emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization and with $75 million in financing arranged by Fidenas, which had assumed a 90 percent stake in Emerson.Revamping at Emerson - New York Times It then issued 30 million shares, some of which were claimed by creditors. Legal battles ensued and continued until mid-August 2001. In early 1995, in an effort to cut costs, Emerson Radio licensed the manufacture of certain video products under the Emerson and G Clef trademarks for a three- year period to Otake Trading Co. Ltd. The company also licensed the sale of these products in the United States and Canada for the same period to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. As a result, Emerson's net sales fell from $654.7 million in fiscal 1995 to $245.7 million in fiscal 1996, with the licensing agreement only providing about $4 million a year in royalty income. Also in 1995, Emerson Radio entered the home theater and car audio fields, and the $900-million-a-year home and personal security market with a carbon monoxide detector. The company planned to eventually lend its name to burglar alarms, motion detectors, personal alarms, smoke detectors, and safety lights; however, the company left this field in fiscal 1997. Additionally, Emerson announced it would license the Emerson name to more than 250 audio and video accessories made by Jasco Products Co., an Oklahoma firm selling cables, remote controls, and appliance cleaning devices.\\"Emerson Turns to New Products,\\" Record-Bergen County, December 10, 1995, p. B1.Ryan, Ken, \\"Home Theater for the Masses,\\" HFN/Home Furnishings News, September 30, 1996, pp. 93, 100. The company took a 27 percent stake in Sport Supply Group, Inc., the largest direct-mail distributor of sporting goods equipment and supplies to the U.S. institutional market, for $11.5 million in late 1996. Subsequent to a net income of $7.4 million in fiscal 1995, Emerson dropped into the red again the following three years. They lost $13.4 million, $24 million, and $1.4 million in fiscal 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively, with net revenues of $245.7 million, $178.7 million, and $162.7 million. Emerson Radio Corp. announced in November 1998 that it had entered into an exclusive agreement with Team Products International, Inc. of Boonton, N.J., a distributor of audio, video and other consumer electronic product accessories in the United States and Canada. They promoted the sale of a wide variety of Emerson branded consumer electronic products and accessories.Emerson Radio Chooses Team Products for Audio Video and Consumer Electronics Accessory License Agreement  Business Wire  Find Articles at BNET.com The owner of Fidenas's, Geoffrey P. Jurick, had assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company in 1992 and in 1998 he added the titles of President and Chairman of the Board. In December 1998 he held 60 percent of Emerson's common stock. Kenneth S. Grossman, a private investor, along with Oaktree Capital Management, a Los Angeles-based investment firm that held a smaller stake in Emerson Radio, proposed to buy Jurick's holdings in the company for more than $14.6 million. The offer was rejected as \\"inadequate.\\"\\"Emerson Rejects As Inadequate Investment Group's Buy-Out Bid,\\" Twice, January 7, 1999, p. 5. Emerson announced in August 1999 that it planned to sell to Oaktree for $28.9 million. On the day the licensing agreement with Otake expired, Emerson replaced the company with Daewoo Electronics Co. Ltd., which entered into a four-year agreement with Emerson to manufacture and sell television and video products bearing the Emerson and G Clef trademark to U.S. retailers. In 1999, Emerson also signed five-year license and supply agreements with Cargil International covering the Caribbean and Central and South American markets, along with WW Mexicana for certain consumer products to be sold in Mexico. They also had a licensing agreement with Telesound Electronics for telephones, answering machines, and caller ID products in the United States and Canada. Net income for Emerson was only $289,000 on net revenues of $158.7 million in fiscal 1999 with a long-term debt of $20.8 million at the end of the fiscal year. Nearly 84 percent of its merchandise that year was imported, primarily from China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand. Tonic Electronics (32 percent), Daewoo (22 percent), and Imarflex (12 percent) were its main suppliers. The company depended heavily on Wal-Mart Stores, which took about 52 percent of its goods in fiscal 1999, and Target Stores, Inc., which took about 24 percent. =2001‚Äìpresent= In 2001, Emerson exited the video electronics business (TVs, DVD players, VCRs) and handed 100% of the manufacturing operations to Funai, which continued to make and market Emerson consumer video products for Wal-Mart. In January 2003, Emerson announced it had entered into a letter of intent naming Sanlian Group of Shandong, China the exclusive distributor of Emerson branded products through its subsidiary, Sanlian Household Electric Appliance Company (SHEAC).Emerson Radio Announces Letter of Intent Finalization With Sanlian Group, One of the Largest Retailers of Electronic Products in China  Business Wire  Find Articles at BNET.com The agreement contemplated the supply and distribution of Emerson originated product categories through SHEAC's 200 retail stores and maintenance service centers as well as its extensive BtoB and BtoC e-commerce network. Sanlian was to license the Emerson brand for additional product categories it finds suitable for China-wide distribution and cooperate with Emerson in the design, development and sourcing for such.

Historical products In 1915, at the company's inception, Emerson's main product was the Universal Cut Records, capable of being played laterally or vertically. Music offered included a wide variety of popular, band, opera, classical, religious, and folk music. Also during their first years, Emerson offered one of the last of the external-horn phonographs, which sold for only $3. Emerson Model 400-3 \\"Patriot\\" (1940) radio, made of Catalin The \\"peewee\\" radio was introduced December 1932. Measuring about 8¬Ω inches long and 6¬º inches wide, approximately 60 percent of all radios sold between early December 1932 and late May 1933 were peewees, half of which were manufactured by Emerson. The Universal Compact line was priced from $17.95 to $32.50. Emerson led the production and sale of this class of radio until 1938, having by then sold more than a million. In 1947 Emerson offered a television set with a 10-inch tube, which retailed for $375. It was among Emerson's first postwar products. They dropped the price to $269.50 by June 1948, when the newly developed television industry had sold 375,000 sets. In 1953, Emerson Radio and Phonograph purchased Quiet Heet Corp., which entered the company into air conditioning. Although radio represented only 15 percent of Emerson's revenue by 1954, the company credited itself as creating the first clock radio, self-powered radio, and transistorized pocket radio. Production of tape recorders began in 1955. When Emerson purchased Allen B. DuMont Laboratories, Inc. in 1958, a higher-priced line of television sets, phonographs and high- fidelity and stereo instruments, along with the DuMont trademark was added to Emerson's products. In 1979, Emerson began selling Heart Aide, after purchasing a large portion of Cardiac Resuscitator Corp. The company spent heavily to develop and produce both an improved implantable cardioverter- defibrillator and a pacemaker. In addition, the company took an 18 percent share in a developer of computerized axial tomographic (CAT) scanners. As this line of products never made money, Emerson disposed of its holdings in them between 1987-88. In 1982, Emerson manufactured the Arcadia 2001, the most well-known of the \\"Emerson Arcadia 2001\\" second-generation 8-bit game console variations. Although, considerably more powerful than the then-dominant Atari 2600, the Arcadia 2001 wasn't released until just before the more-advanced Atari 5200 and the ColecoVision, in mid-1982. It was successful in other countries, however, because Atari had exclusive rights to many games, it was nearly impossible for Emerson to market in the United States due to the lack of popular game titles. In 1983, Emerson began selling re-branded Goldstar televisions at inflated prices for a substantial profit. The compact disc player and microwave oven were introduced in 1985 doubling sales. In 1986 Emerson began importing and marketing compact refrigerators. Camcorders, telephones, and answering machines were added to its product line in fiscal 1988. Personal computers and facsimile machines were added in 1990. In 1995, Emerson Radio entered the home theater and car audio fields, and the $900-million-a-year home and personal security market with a carbon monoxide detector, however, they left this field in 1997. Also in 1995, Emerson announced it would license its name to more than 250 audio and video accessories made by Jasco Products Co., a firm selling cables, remote controls, and appliance cleaning devices. Emerson began manufacturing and selling television and video products bearing the Emerson and G Clef trademark to U.S. retailers in 1999. They also had a licensing agreement with Telesound Electronics for telephones, answering machines, and caller ID products in the United States and Canada.

It was home to the Spanish Grand Prix nine times between 1968 and 1981, and the Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix 15 times between 1969 and 1988. Designed by John Hugenholtz (who also created Suzuka), the circuit was built by Alessandro Rocci in 1967 on arid scrub land. It has a short main straight and most of the course consisted of tight, twisty corners so overtaking was extremely difficult. An example of this came when Gilles Villeneuve successfully defended his lead throughout the 1981 Spanish Grand Prix, despite a tail of four potentially faster cars. Villeneuve's turbocharged Ferrari 126CK, while powerful and fast on the straight, did not have as efficient ground effect aerodynamics as his pursuers - Jacques Laffite (V12 Ligier-Matra), John Watson (McLaren-Ford), Carlos Reutemann (Williams- Ford), and Elio de Angelis (Lotus-Ford) and was slower through the turns. This victory was to be the last one of Villeneuve's career. Jarama hosted its last Formula One race in 1981 when it was deemed too narrow for modern racing. It still holds sports car, touring car and motorcycle races. The circuit was lengthened in 1991, and then upgraded in 2015. In 1987, Jarama hosted Round 2 of the inaugural World Touring Car Championship for Group A cars, the 1987 Jarama 4 Hours. The race was won by Roberto Ravaglia and Emanuele Pirro driving a Schnitzer Motorsport BMW M3. Pole position for the race had been taken by triple Le Mans 24 Hour winner Klaus Ludwig in a Ford Sierra RS Cosworth turbo with a time of 1:31.434, while the fastest lap was by England's Andy Rouse (also in a Sierra Cosworth) with a time of 1:33.710.

H√ºrriyet / 05.03.2000 He quickly rose to prominence in the Turkish film industry. Many of his works were devoted to the plight of ordinary, working class people in Turkey. G√ºney won the Palme d'Or with the film Yol he co-produced with ≈ûerif G√∂ren at Cannes Film Festival in 1982. He was at constant odds with the Turkish government because of his portrayals of Kurdish culture, people and language in his movies. After killing a judge, something Yƒ±lmaz claimed to be innocent of, and being convicted in a trial in 1974, he fled the country and later lost his citizenship. Background Yƒ±lmaz G√ºney was born in 1937 in the Yenice county of Adana. His father was from Siverek in ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province and his mother was from Varto in Mu≈ü Province. His parents migrated to Adana to work as cotton field laborers. As a result of his family background, young Yƒ±lmaz grew among the working class. This was a strong background for his future works which generally focused on a realistic portrayal of downtrodden and marginalized strata of the population in the country. G√ºney studied law and economics at the universities of Ankara and Istanbul, but by the age of 21 he found himself actively involved in film- making. Career in Turkey As Ye≈üil√ßam, the Turkish studio system, a handful of directors, including Atƒ±f Yƒ±lmaz, began to use cinema as a means of addressing the problems of the people. State-sanctioned melodramas, war films, and play adaptations had mostly previously been played in Turkish theaters. These new filmmakers began to shoot and screen more realistic pictures of Kurdish and Turkish life. Yƒ±lmaz G√ºney was one of the most popular names to emerge from this trend, a gruff-looking young actor who earned the moniker √áirkin Kral (\\"the Ugly King\\" in Turkish) or \\"pa≈üay na≈üir√Æn\\" in Kurdish. After working as an apprentice screenwriter for and assistant to Atƒ±f Yƒ±lmaz, G√ºney soon began appearing in as many as 20 films a year and became Turkey's one of the most popular actors. The early 1960s brought restricted freedom to Turkey, and G√ºney was imprisoned from 1960 to 1962. In prison he wrote what some labeled a \\"communist\\" novel, They Died with Their Heads Bowed. The country's political situation and G√ºney's relationship with the authorities became even more tense in the ensuing years. Not content with his star status atop the Turkish film industry, G√ºney began directing his own pictures in 1965. By 1968 he had formed his own production company, G√ºney Filmcilik. Over the next few years, the titles of his films mirrored the feelings of the people of Turkey: Umut (Hope, 1970); Aƒüƒ±t (Elegy, 1972); Acƒ± (Pain, 1971); The Hopeless (1971). Umut is considered to be the first realistic film of Turkish Cinema, the American director Elia Kazan was among the first to praise the film; ‚ÄúUmut is a poetic film, completely native, not an imitation of Hollywood or any of the European masters, it had risen out of a village environment‚Äù. After the military coup in March 1971, he was in pretrail for weeks, and he decided to leave Istanbul to evade further trouble with the authorities. Arrested for harboring anarchist students, G√ºney was jailed in 1972 during preproduction of Zavallƒ±lar (The Miserable, 1975), and before completing Endi≈üe (Worry, 1974), which was finished in 1974 by G√ºney's assistant, ≈ûerif G√∂ren. This was a role that G√∂ren would repeat over the next dozen years, directing several scripts that G√ºney wrote in prison. Released from prison in 1974 as part of a general amnesty, G√ºney was re-arrested that same year for shooting Sefa Mutlu, the public prosecutor of Yumurtalƒ±k district in Adana Province, to death in a night club as a result of a drunken rowTurkish Daily H√ºrriyet Account of the eye witness Mehmet Uyulhas and given a prison sentence of 19 years. G√ºney has always declared his innocence. During this stretch of incarceration, his most successful screenplays were S√ºr√º (The Herd, 1978) and D√º≈üman (The Enemy, 1979), both directed by Zeki √ñkten. D√º≈üman won an Honourable Mention at the 30th Berlin International Film Festival in 1980. G√ºney's first marriage was with fellow Turkish actress and Miss Turkey, Nebahat √áehre, who co-starred alongside G√ºney in several films. Their relationship began in 1964 and they married in 1967. Prior to his marriage, G√ºney fathered a daughter, Elif G√ºney P√ºt√ºn, from his relationship with Birsen Can √únal. Despite G√ºney and Nebahat √áehre's divorce in 1968, many of those closest to G√ºney have always regarded √áehre to have been the love of his life. Later, G√ºney married Jale Fatma S√ºleymangil, more commonly known as Fato≈ü G√ºney, in 1970. Together, they had a son, Remzi Yƒ±lmaz P√ºt√ºn. Exile and death Grave of Yƒ±lmaz G√ºney at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris In September 1980, G√ºney's works were banned by the new military junta. G√ºney declared, ‚ÄúThere are only two possibilities: to fight or to give up, I chose to fight‚Äù. After escaping from prison in 1981 and fleeing to France, G√ºney won the Palme d'Or at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival for his film Yol, whose director in the field was once again ≈ûerif G√∂ren. It was not until 1983 that G√ºney resumed directing, telling a brutal tale of imprisoned children in his final film, Duvar (The Wall, 1983), made in France with the cooperation of the French government. Meanwhile, Turkey's government revoked his citizenship and a court sentenced him to twenty-two extra years in jail.New York Times, 10 September 1984, Yilmaz Guney Is Dead;Turkish Film Director Yƒ±lmaz G√ºney died of gastric cancer on September 9, 1984, in Paris, France.

She emigrated from London in 1968 and became one of Australia's significant sex symbols of the early-1970s. Abigail was educated in France, and came to Australia when she was given the chance to appear as the female lead in a local theatre production in Perth of the British comedy There's a Girl in My Soup. She is best known for her roles in two prominent Australian soap operas, where she became known simply as Abigail. She first became best known to Australians as a sex symbol in Number 96, as the first actress to play Bev Houghton; and then for her role as conniving Caroline Morrell in Sons and Daughters. She subsequently appeared in numerous other soap opera roles including Neighbours, Family and Friends and Chances Personal life Abigail was twice married; first to her manager actor Mark Hashfield (who also appeared on Number 96 as Alan Cotterill) and then to actor Adrian Wright. Early career Abigail began her career in show business in her native UK, appearing in the TV shows Robin Hood and Continental Theatre. After arriving in Perth, Australia in 1968, she originally studied civil engineering at university and acted on the side, she made her major entry in to show business when she was given the female lead in a theatrical production of the British comedy There's a Girl in My Soup. She then moved from Perth to Sydney, New South Wales and appeared in a television advertisement with Phil Silvers and the TV series Delta. Number 96 In 1972 Abigail shot to fame appearing in the Network Ten sexed-up soap opera Number 96 as Bev Houghton. She was promoted as a sex symbol and became \\"Australia's undisputed number 1 female sex symbol in the early 1970s\\" through her role in Number 96, which provided fleeting nude glimpses.Atterton, Margot. (Ed.) The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Australian Showbiz, Sunshine Books, 1984. p 11 As the show's most famous sex symbol many people assume that Abigail was the first woman to appear topless on Australian television; however, that credit belongs to fellow cast member Vivienne Garrett in the same series.Mercado, Andrew. Super Aussie Soaps, Pluto Press Australia, 2004. pp 44‚Äì45 To the surprise of her television fans, Abigail left the cast of Number 96 in mid-1973, and her character of Bev Houghton was recast to Victoria Raymond (a.k.a. Victoria Resch), who had been written into the series shortly before Abigail's departure and also presented as a sex symbol. Publishing and music In 1973, after leaving Number 96, she published her autobiography, Call Me Abigail which sold 150,000 copies in its first two weeks of sale. Also in 1973, Abigail made an attempt, one of the first soap stars to do so prior to Kylie Minogue) at a popular music career and scored a hit with a cover of Serge Gainsbourg's \\"Je t'aime... moi non plus\\", which reached the top 10 in Australia. Although this debut was a success, follow- ups, including a comedic release with ventriloquist Chris Kirby, were not. Film and other During this period she appeared in a series of brief cameo roles in a string of sex comedy films such as Alvin Purple (1973), and its 1974 sequel Alvin Rides Again. In 1974, Abigail would perform a striptease in the burlesque comedy \\"The Legend of San Peel\\" in The Barrel Theatre, a well- known strip palace in Kings Cross, while struggling to find serious acting jobs. In 1975, in a brief return to television she appeared in Class of '75 for three weeks as a prim French Senior Mistress in a black wig and frumpy spectacles. Also in 1975 she played Esmerelda in The True Story of Eskimo Nell and in 1976 appeared in another bawdy comedy Eliza Fraser. Abigail returned to Number 96 in November 1976. Her new comedy character, the oft-divorced Eve, would potentially appear in a spinoff series, Fair Game, with Elaine Lee and Lynette Curran. It did not eventuate, although the completed pilot was divided up to create segments of three episodes of Number 96 (Episodes 1079-1081).TV Week magazine, Southdown Press, 6 November 1976, \\"Sydney Viewing, Monday 8 - Tuesday 9\\". Abigail also appeared in a recurring sketch in comedy series The Norman Gunston Show called \\"The Checkout Chicks\\". This sketch, a send-up of melodramatic soap operas set in a supermarket, mostly featured other former Number 96 actors - Vivienne Garrett, Candy Raymond, Philippa Baker, Judy Lynne and Anne Louise Lambert. The show was finally cancelled in July 1977. Soap opera post-96 In 1977, Abigail appeared in the hospital-based series The Young Doctors as super-efficient secretary Hilary Templeton who worked for Philip Winter (Noel Trevarthen), a celebrity patient of the hospital. In the show, Winter is murdered and she leaves the storyline, only to later return with her character now running the company of her former boss. Also in 1977 she had a cameo role in the film Summer City, which is notable for being the first to have Mel Gibson in a major role. Abigail had some success in the theatre, specialising in comedy roles. She toured New South Wales and Queensland with the stage farce A Bedfull of Foreigners in 1983.

In 1990 she appeared in Sher Mountain Killings Mystery and was a regular cast member of the short-lived soap opera Family and Friends and in 1991 appeared in another soap Chances. In 1994 she presented a prime-time repeat of the 1977 Number 96 retrospective, And They Said It Couldn't Last. Retirement from acting Her last television appearance was in 2002, when she briefly became a spokesperson for weight-loss company Jenny Craig. She claimed to have lost 17 kilograms in seven weeks. Abigail was interviewed on Sydney radio station 2GB on her 60th birthday in 2006. At that time she was living on the Gold Coast, Queensland. In March 2011, Australian current affairs program Today Tonight produced a story on Abigail, claiming that she had fallen on hard times, and claiming she was living as a squatter in a derelict church. A rebuttal story was aired the following evening by rival current affairs program, A Current Affair. In fact she had been living there with permission, with her husband, as her home had been partially destroyed by floods. Her damaged home was being prepared for rebuilding. The Today Tonight story captured some hidden camera footage of Abigail. She did not appear on camera consensually.

The Royal Mail postcode begins LL75. The community population taken at the 2011 census was 1,178. The village itself having a population of 557. Its Welsh name means at the end of (or head of) a beach, and it is located near Traeth Coch (Red Wharf Bay). There is a small river, Afon Nodwydd which runs through it. The village's ancient name was Llanfair Betws Geraint. In 1170 it was the site of a battle when Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd landed with an army raised in Ireland in an attempt to claim a share of the kingdom of Gwynedd following the death of his father Owain Gwynedd. He was defeated and killed here by the forces of his half-brothers Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd and Rhodri. In 1859, Charles Dickens stayed in the village on his trip, as a journalist for The Times, to visit the wreck of the Royal Charter in Moelfre. Between 1908 and 1950 it was served by Pentraeth railway station, on the Red Wharf Bay branch line. The village has a football side, Pentraeth F.C., who play in the Welsh Alliance Division 2, the fourth tier of Welsh football. The centre of the village is The Square. It is bounded by St. Mary's Church and the Panton Arms public house as well as a row of shops called Cloth Hall. This was founded in the 19th century by Benjamin Thomas as a general store. It continued as a grocery store into the 1990s, and is now occupied by a carpet shop as well as a bakery and party-ware hire shop. The community includes Rhos Cefn Hir. St Mary's Church St Mary's Church is the village church. The date of construction is unknown, but is probably from some time between the 12th to 14th centuries. Some medieval stonework remains in three walls of the building. A chapel was added to the south side in the 16th or 17th century, and the church was altered and refurbished during the 19th century. The church is still in use, as part of the Church in Wales, and is one of five churches in a combined parish. It is a Grade II listed building, a designation given to \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\", in particular because of the retention of medieval fabric in a predominately 19th-century building, and its \\"fine\\" memorials.

Hecataeus of Abdera or of Teos (), was a Greek historian and Pyrrhonist philosopher who flourished in the 4th century BC. Life Diogenes La√´rtius (ix.61) relates that he was a student of Pyrrho, along with Timon of Phlius and Nausiphanes of Teos, and includes him among the Pyrrhoneans. Diodorus Siculus (i.46.8) tells us that Hecataeus visited Thebes in the times of Ptolemy I Soter, and composed a history of Egypt. Diodorus supplies the comment that many additional Greeks went to and wrote about Egypt in the same period. The Suda gives him the nickname, 'critic grammarian' and says that he lived in the time of the successors to Alexander.Klaus Meister \\"Hecataeus\\" (2) of Abdera in Oxford Classical Dictionary 3rd. ed. Oxford; Oxford University Press 1999 p.671 Works No complete works of Hecataeus have survived, and our knowledge of his writing exists only in fragments located in various ancient Greek and Latin authors' works, primarily in Diodorus Siculus, whose ethnography of Egypt (Bibliotheca historica, Book I) represents by far the largest amount. Diodorus mostly paraphrases Hecataeus, thus it is difficult to extract Hecataeus' actual writings. (as in Karl Wilhelm Ludwig M√ºller's Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum). Hecataeus wrote the work AegyptiacaWachsmuth (1895), Tr√ºdinger (1918), Burton (1972) or On the Egyptians (the same title of Manetho's later work),Jacoby (1943), Murray (1970), Fraser (1972) both suggestions are based on known titles of other ethnographic works, an account of Egypt‚Äôs customs, beliefs and geography, and the single largest fragment from this lost work is held to be Diodorus' account of the Ramesseum, tomb of Osymandyas (i.47-50). Diodorus (ii.47.1-2) and Apollonius of Rhodes tell of another work by Hecataeus, On the Hyperboreans. According to the Suda, the 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia, he wrote a treatise on the poetry of Hesiod and Homer, but nothing of them has survived.Suda online His digression on the Jews in Aegiptica was the first mention of them in Greek literature. It was subsequently paraphrased in Diodorus Siculus 40.3.8.

In trimorphic plants there are three forms, differing in the lengths of their pistils and stamens, in size and color of their pollen grains, and in some other respects; and, as in each of the three forms there are two sets of stamens, the three forms possess altogether six sets of stamens and three kinds of pistils. These organs are so proportioned in length to each other that half the stamens in two of the forms stand on a level with the stigma of the third form. To obtain full fertility with these plants, it is necessary that the stigma of the one should be fertilized by pollen taken from the stamens of corresponding height in another form. Hence six unions are legitimate, that is, fully fertile, and 12 are illegitimate, or more or less unfertile. Wallace has shown that the females of certain butterflies from the Malay Archipelago appear in three conspicuously distinct forms without intermediate links.

It was originally published in the October 1966 issue (Issue 107, Vol 16, No 10) of Worlds of If. It was later reprinted in the collection of the same nameNew York: Ballantine, 1968, pp. 9-28, and Crashlander.New York: Ballantine, 1994, pp. 8-28, The story is set in Niven's fictional Known Space universe. It is notable for including a neutron star before their (then hypothetical) existence was widely known. \\"Neutron Star\\" is the first to feature Beowulf Shaeffer, the ex-pilot and reluctant hero of many of Niven's Known Space stories. It also marked the first appearance of the nearly indestructible General Products starship hull, as well as its creators, the Pierson's Puppeteers. The star itself, BVS-1, is featured in the novel Protector (1973), where it is named \\"Phssthpok's Star\\". A prelude to the story is also included in the novel Juggler of Worlds. Plot summary Beowulf Shaeffer, a native of the planet We Made It and unemployed for the last eight months due to a stock market crash, is contracted by a Pierson's Puppeteer, the Regional President of General Products on We Made It, to pilot a General Products-hulled starship, in a close approach about neutron star BVS-1. The Puppeteers want to determine why two previous researchers, Peter and Sonya Laskin, were killed during the previous attempt on a similar mission. Shaeffer has no intention of even attempting the dangerous mission, but agrees anyway ‚Äì he has other plans. He has the Puppeteers construct what he dubs the Skydiver to his precise specifications, supposedly to ensure he survives to return with the relevant data. It includes an advanced sensor package, a high-powered thruster, and a high-powered laser. It is thus the only warship ever constructed by the cowardly and paranoid alien race ‚Äì a prize beyond value and a perfect means of escape. Desiring to maintain human-puppeteer relations, an operative of the U.N.'s Bureau of Alien Affairs, Sigmund Ausfaller, explains the situation to them, and has them install a bomb on the ship. Ausfaller informs Shaeffer that if he does not attempt the mission he will be sent to debtors prison, and that if he attempts to escape in the ship the bomb will be detonated within a week ‚Äì well before he could even reach another planet, let alone find a buyer for the ship. Shaeffer, realizing he is trapped, agrees to fly the mission. The Skydiver reaches the neutron star, and the ship's autopilot puts the Skydiver into a hyperbolic orbit that will take 24 hours to reach periapsis with BVS-1, passing a mile above its surface. During the descent Schaeffer notices many unusual things: the stars ahead of him began to turn blue from Doppler shift as his speed increases enormously; the stars behind him, rather than being red-shifted, were blue too as their light accelerated with him into the gravity well of the neutron star. The nose of the ship is pulled towards the neutron star even when he tries to move the ship to view his surroundings. As the mysterious pull exceeds one Earth gravity, Shaeffer accelerates the Skydiver to compensate for the unknown X-force until he is in free fall (though the accelerometer registers 1.2 gees). Shaeffer eventually realizes what the X-force is: the tidal force. The strong tidal pull of the neutron star is trying to force the ends of the ship (and Shaeffer himself) into two separate orbits. Shaeffer programs the autopilot in a thrust pattern that allows him to reach the center of mass of the ship in effective free-fall, though he nearly fails to do so. The ship reaches periapsis where tidal forces nearly pull Shaeffer apart anyway, but he manages to hold himself in the access space at the ship's center of mass and survives. After returning to We Made It, Shaeffer is hospitalized (he has received a sunburn by starlight blue-shifted into the ultraviolet) for observation at the Puppeteer's insistence. While explaining tidal forces to the Puppeteer, Schaeffer realizes the alien had no knowledge of tides, something that would be elementary for a sentient species living on a world with a moon. The Puppeteers are extremely cautious when dealing with other races, and keep all details about their homeworld secret. When Schaeffer mentions that he can tell reporters the fact that the Puppeteer's world has no moon, the Puppeteer agrees to give Shaeffer a million stars (a fortune in galactic currency) in return for his silence. Shaeffer asks the alien how he likes being blackmailed for a change. Notes *In the story \\"Ghost\\", including as framing story for the Crashlander collection, Schaeffer is told that the Puppeteers were well aware of the tidal effect. The actual motive for them paying for Shaeffer's silence was that if they did not, he would realize this. By paying him, they could both shut him up and disseminate false information about the Puppeteer homeworld. *In the \\"Afterthoughts\\" section of the Tales of Known Space collection, Niven writes: \\"I keep meeting people who have done mathematical treatments of the problem raised in the short story 'Neutron Star', .... Alas and dammit, Shaeffer can't survive. It turns out that his ship leaves the star spinning, and keeps the spin.\\" Reception \\"Neutron Star\\" won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story and ranked #30 in the LOCUS Magazine Readers Poll, All-time Best Novellette. Carl Sagan criticized \\"Neutron Star\\" for assuming that tidal forces produced by gravity would be forgotten, and that an unmanned probe would not be the first to explore a neutron star. Reviewing the collection Neutron Star, Algis Budrys said that the story was \\"in itself worth the paperback price of admission\\".

The oasis is located about inland from the Persian Gulf. All urban areas are located in the traditional oasis of Al-Hasa. In addition to the oasis, the county also includes the giant Empty Quarter desert, making it the largest governorate in Saudi Arabia in terms of area. The Empty Quarter has the world's largest oil fields, and connects Saudi Arabia to Qatar, the UAE, and Oman. The Governorate's population is over 1,100,000 (). In the past, Al-Ahsa belonged to the historical region known as Bahrain, along with Qatif and the present-day Bahrain islands. One campus of a major Saudi university, King Faisal University, founded in 1975, is located in Al-Ahsa with the faculties of agriculture, veterinary medicine and animal resources. The Hofuf campus also has facilities where Saudi women can study medicine, dentistry and home economics. A large branch of the private Arab Open University is also located in Al-Ahsa.

(This is recognised in the Treaty of S√®vres signed in 1920 with the other official partitionings of the Ottoman Empire.) 1932: Al-Ahsa becomes part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, under the King Abdulaziz. 1930s: Huge petroleum deposits are discovered near Dammam, resulting in rapid modernization for the region. Jabal Qara is located 16 km (9.9 mi) east of Hofuf City Early 1960s: The oil fields in Al-Ahsa reach the production level of 1 million barrels per day.  Population and economy According to 2005 estimate, Al-Ahsa has over 908,000 people. All are Muslims. Over the centuries, residents of the oasis have included the Banu Abdul Qays, the Banu Uqayl, and the Bani Khalid. Oil production and agriculture are the two main economic activities of the Al- Ahsa. Al-Ahsa is the home of some of the richest oil fields in the world. Natural fresh-water springs have surfaced in the region for millennia, encouraging human habitation and agricultural efforts (date palm cultivation especially) since prehistoric times. The Saudi Ministry of Agriculture established a factory to process its rich date harvest at the rate of five tons daily. Other components of its agricultural output include rice, corn, citrus, and other fruits. In addition, intensive livestock raising, involving thousands of sheep, goats, cattle and camels and more than 15 major poultry farms producing more than 100 million eggs a year, make Al-Ahsa one of the major food producers for the kingdom. Manufacturing‚Äîboth the traditional small-scale cottage industry kind (e.g. the traditional mantle and pottery) and large-scale industries such as cement and plastics‚Äîhas also been strongly encouraged.

It is believed that it was bigger in the past. *Al-Dalwah *Al- Shahareen *Al-Sabat *Abu Thor *Al-Turaibil *Al-Tuhaimiyah *Al-Mizawi *Al- Jeshah (+29,000) *Al-Jubail (+10,000) =Northern villages= Here is an incomplete list: *Al-Gherain *Al-Mutairfi (+29,000) which is well known for its natural springs *Al-Julaijlah *Al-Marah *Al-Garn *Al-Shigaig *Al-Wazziyah. =Associated small villages= Here is an incomplete list: *Al Hafayer *Yabrin  Climate  Al-Ahsa has a dry, tropical climate, with a five-month summer and a relatively cold winter. It enjoys the benefit of copious reserves of underground water which has allowed the area to develop its agricultural potential. Nevertheless, Al-Ahsa has to deal with tons of sand which the wind carries and deposits over the land. To counter this problem, the Kingdom has planted large barriers of trees to prevent the wind-borne sand from damaging inhabited and agricultural areas.  Historical and recreation sites  Jawatha Mosque One of the oldest mosques in Islam, Jawatha Mosque, is reputed to be found here, as well, and several historic remnants of Ottoman Turkish influence can be seen in buildings such as Qasr Ibrahim and the Qasr Sahood. Many pictures of old Al-Ahsa and the Eastern Province were taken by the Danish explorer and convert to Islam Knud Holmboe (1902‚Äì1931) in his travels through the Middle East. Here is a list of some historical and recreation sites: *Jawatha Mosque *Uqair: Seaport is situated on the Persian Gulf in eastern Al- Ahsa. It has lost its focal role as a fishing and transport site, and is now an outing place for people of the region. *Qa·π£r IbrƒÅhƒ´m () is a castle built during Ottoman rule. It is located prominently in Al-Hofuf city. *Natural Springs like those in Umm Sabaa provides curative mineral water at a steady rate. *Jabl Al-Garah is a hill (locally called a mountain) in Al-Garah a village of the same name offers visitors cool air in the summer months. * Qasr Sahood () is a Palace built during Ottoman rule in the city of Al-Mubarraz. * Salwa Beach () is sandy beach about from Al-Hofuf. * Al-Shu øbah Mountain (). * Jabl Al-Arba ø () are sandy hills about from Al-Hofuf, on the way to Qatar . * Al-Ahsa National Museum. * Al-Ahsa National Park, located at Al-Omran town.

Rivest. It provides worst-case O(log n) lookup time, and O(log n) amortized insertion and deletion time. Unlike most other self-balancing binary search trees which provide worst case O(log n) lookup time, scapegoat trees have no additional per-node memory overhead compared to a regular binary search tree: a node stores only a key and two pointers to the child nodes. This makes scapegoat trees easier to implement and, due to data structure alignment, can reduce node overhead by up to one-third. Instead of the small incremental rebalancing operations used by most balanced tree algorithms, scapegoat trees rarely but expensively choose a \\"scapegoat\\" and completely rebuild the subtree rooted at the scapegoat into a complete binary tree. Thus, scapegoat trees have O(n) worst-case update performance. Theory A binary search tree is said to be weight-balanced if half the nodes are on the left of the root, and half on the right. An Œ±-weight-balanced node is defined as meeting a relaxed weight balance criterion: size(left) ‚â§ Œ±*size(node) size(right) ‚â§ Œ±*size(node) Where size can be defined recursively as: function size(node) is if node = nil then return 0 else return size(node->left) + size(node->right) + 1 end if end function Even a degenerate tree (linked list) satisfies this condition if Œ±=1, whereas an Œ±=0.5 would only match almost complete binary trees. A binary search tree that is Œ±-weight-balanced must also be Œ±-height-balanced, that is height(tree) ‚â§ By contraposition, a tree that is not Œ±-height-balanced is not Œ±-weight-balanced. Scapegoat trees are not guaranteed to keep Œ±-weight-balance at all times, but are always loosely Œ±-height-balanced in that height(scapegoat tree) ‚â§ + 1. Violations of this height balance condition can be detected at insertion time, and imply that a violation of the weight balance condition must exist. This makes scapegoat trees similar to red-black trees in that they both have restrictions on their height. They differ greatly though in their implementations of determining where the rotations (or in the case of scapegoat trees, rebalances) take place. Whereas red-black trees store additional 'color' information in each node to determine the location, scapegoat trees find a scapegoat which isn't Œ±-weight-balanced to perform the rebalance operation on. This is loosely similar to AVL trees, in that the actual rotations depend on 'balances' of nodes, but the means of determining the balance differs greatly. Since AVL trees check the balance value on every insertion/deletion, it is typically stored in each node; scapegoat trees are able to calculate it only as needed, which is only when a scapegoat needs to be found. Unlike most other self-balancing search trees, scapegoat trees are entirely flexible as to their balancing. They support any Œ± such that 0.5 < Œ± < 1\\\\. A high Œ± value results in fewer balances, making insertion quicker but lookups and deletions slower, and vice versa for a low Œ±. Therefore in practical applications, an Œ± can be chosen depending on how frequently these actions should be performed. Operations =Lookup= Lookup is not modified from a standard binary search tree, and has a worst-case time of O(log n). This is in contrast to splay trees which have a worst-case time of O(n). The reduced node memory overhead compared to other self-balancing binary search trees can further improve locality of reference and caching. =Insertion= Insertion is implemented with the same basic ideas as an unbalanced binary search tree, however with a few significant changes. When finding the insertion point, the depth of the new node must also be recorded. This is implemented via a simple counter that gets incremented during each iteration of the lookup, effectively counting the number of edges between the root and the inserted node. If this node violates the Œ±-height-balance property (defined above), a rebalance is required. To rebalance, an entire subtree rooted at a scapegoat undergoes a balancing operation. The scapegoat is defined as being an ancestor of the inserted node which isn't Œ±-weight- balanced. There will always be at least one such ancestor. Rebalancing any of them will restore the Œ±-height-balanced property. One way of finding a scapegoat, is to climb from the new node back up to the root and select the first node that isn't Œ±-weight-balanced. Climbing back up to the root requires O(log n) storage space, usually allocated on the stack, or parent pointers. This can actually be avoided by pointing each child at its parent as you go down, and repairing on the walk back up. To determine whether a potential node is a viable scapegoat, we need to check its Œ±-weight-balanced property. To do this we can go back to the definition: size(left) ‚â§ Œ±*size(node) size(right) ‚â§ Œ±*size(node) However a large optimisation can be made by realising that we already know two of the three sizes, leaving only the third to be calculated. Consider the following example to demonstrate this. Assuming that we're climbing back up to the root: size(parent) = size(node) + size(sibling) + 1 But as: size(inserted node) = 1. The case is trivialized down to: size[x+1] = size[x] + size(sibling) + 1 Where x = this node, x + 1 = parent and size(sibling) is the only function call actually required. Once the scapegoat is found, the subtree rooted at the scapegoat is completely rebuilt to be perfectly balanced. This can be done in O(n) time by traversing the nodes of the subtree to find their values in sorted order and recursively choosing the median as the root of the subtree. As rebalance operations take O(n) time (dependent on the number of nodes of the subtree), insertion has a worst-case performance of O(n) time. However, because these worst-case scenarios are spread out, insertion takes O(log n) amortized time. Sketch of proof for cost of insertion Define the Imbalance of a node v to be the absolute value of the difference in size between its left node and right node minus 1, or 0, whichever is greater. In other words: I(v) = \\\\operatorname{max}(\\\\operatorname{left}(v) - \\\\operatorname{right}(v) - 1, 0) Immediately after rebuilding a subtree rooted at v, I(v) = 0. Lemma: Immediately before rebuilding the subtree rooted at v, I(v) \\\\in \\\\Omega (v) (\\\\Omega is Big Omega Notation.) Proof of lemma: Let v_0 be the root of a subtree immediately after rebuilding. h(v_0) = \\\\log(v_0 + 1) . If there are \\\\Omega (v_0) degenerate insertions (that is, where each inserted node increases the height by 1), then I(v) \\\\in \\\\Omega (v_0) , h(v) = h(v_0) + \\\\Omega (v_0) and \\\\log(v) \\\\le \\\\log(v_0 + 1) + 1 . Since I(v) \\\\in \\\\Omega (v) before rebuilding, there were \\\\Omega (v) insertions into the subtree rooted at v that did not result in rebuilding. Each of these insertions can be performed in O(\\\\log n) time. The final insertion that causes rebuilding costs O(v). Using aggregate analysis it becomes clear that the amortized cost of an insertion is O(\\\\log n): {\\\\Omega (v) O(\\\\log{n}) + O(v) \\\\over \\\\Omega (v)} = O(\\\\log{n}) =Deletion= Scapegoat trees are unusual in that deletion is easier than insertion. To enable deletion, scapegoat trees need to store an additional value with the tree data structure. This property, which we will call MaxNodeCount simply represents the highest achieved NodeCount. It is set to NodeCount whenever the entire tree is rebalanced, and after insertion is set to max(MaxNodeCount, NodeCount). To perform a deletion, we simply remove the node as you would in a simple binary search tree, but if NodeCount ‚â§ Œ±*MaxNodeCount then we rebalance the entire tree about the root, remembering to set MaxNodeCount to NodeCount. This gives deletion its worst-case performance of O(n) time; however, it is amortized to O(log n) average time. Sketch of proof for cost of deletion Suppose the scapegoat tree has n elements and has just been rebuilt (in other words, it is a complete binary tree). At most n/2 - 1 deletions can be performed before the tree must be rebuilt. Each of these deletions take O(\\\\log{n}) time (the amount of time to search for the element and flag it as deleted). The n/2 deletion causes the tree to be rebuilt and takes O(\\\\log{n}) + O(n) (or just O(n)) time. Using aggregate analysis it becomes clear that the amortized cost of a deletion is O(\\\\log{n}): {\\\\sum_{1}^ O(\\\\log{n}) + O(n) \\\\over {n \\\\over 2}} = {{n \\\\over 2}O(\\\\log{n}) + O(n) \\\\over {n \\\\over 2}} = O(\\\\log{n}) \\\\ Etymology The name Scapegoat tree \\"[...] is based on the common wisdom that, when something goes wrong, the first thing people tend to do is find someone to blame (the scapegoat).\\" In the Bible, a scapegoat is an animal that is ritually burdened with the sins of others, and then driven away.

It is a generalization of the maximum modulus principle, which is only applicable to bounded domains. Background In the theory of complex functions, it is known that the modulus (absolute value) of a holomorphic (complex differentiable) function in the interior of a bounded region is bounded by its modulus on the boundary of the region. More precisely, if a non-constant function f:\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{C} is holomorphic in a bounded regionThe term region is not uniformly employed in the literature; here, a region is taken to mean a nonempty connected open subset of the complex plane. \\\\Omega and continuous on its closure \\\\overline{\\\\Omega}=\\\\Omega\\\\cup\\\\partial \\\\Omega, then f(z_0)<\\\\sup_{z\\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega} f(z) for all z_0\\\\in \\\\Omega. This is known as the maximum modulus principle. (In fact, since \\\\overline{\\\\Omega} is compact and f is continuous, there actually exists some w_0\\\\in\\\\partial \\\\Omega such that f(w_0)=\\\\sup_{z\\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega} f(z).) The maximum modulus principle is generally used to conclude that a holomorphic function is bounded in a region after showing that it is bounded on its boundary. However, the maximum modulus principle cannot be applied to an unbounded region of the complex plane. As a concrete example, let us examine the behavior of the holomorphic function f(z) = \\\\exp(\\\\exp(z)) in the unbounded strip :S = \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{z:\\\\Im(z)\\\\in \\\\big(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2},\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\big)\\\\Big\\\\\\\\}. Although f(x\\\\pm \\\\pi i/2)=1, so that f is bounded on boundary \\\\partial S, f grows rapidly without bound when z\\\\to\\\\infty along the positive real axis. The difficulty here stems from the extremely fast growth of f along the positive real axis. If the growth rate of f is guaranteed to not be \\"too fast,\\" as specified by an appropriate growth condition, the Phragm√©n‚ÄìLindel√∂f principle can be applied to show that boundedness of f on the region's boundary implies that f is in fact bounded in the whole region, effectively extending the maximum modulus principle to unbounded regions.  Outline of the technique  Suppose we are given a holomorphic function f and an unbounded region S, and we want to show that f\\\\leq M on S. In a typical Phragm√©n‚ÄìLindel√∂f argument, we introduce a certain multiplicative factor h_\\\\epsilon satisfying \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon \\\\to 0} h_\\\\epsilon= 1 to \\"subdue\\" the growth of f. In particular, h_\\\\epsilon is chosen such that (i): fh_\\\\epsilon is holomorphic for all \\\\epsilon>0 and fh_\\\\epsilon\\\\leq M on the boundary \\\\partial S_{\\\\mathrm{bdd}} of an appropriate bounded subregion S_{\\\\mathrm{bdd}}\\\\subset S; and (ii): the asymptotic behavior of fh_\\\\epsilon allows us to establish that fh_\\\\epsilon\\\\leq M for z\\\\in S\\\\setminus \\\\overline{S_{\\\\mathrm{bdd}}} (i.e., the unbounded part of S outside the closure of the bounded subregion). This allows us to apply the maximum modulus principle to first conclude that fh_\\\\epsilon\\\\leq M on \\\\overline{S_{\\\\mathrm{bdd}}} and then extend the conclusion to all z\\\\in S. Finally, we let \\\\epsilon\\\\to 0 so that f(z)h_\\\\epsilon(z)\\\\to f(z) for every z\\\\in S in order to conclude that f\\\\leq M on S. In the literature of complex analysis, there are many examples of the Phragm√©n‚ÄìLindel√∂f principle applied to unbounded regions of differing types, and also a version of this principle may be applied in a similar fashion to subharmonic and superharmonic functions.  Example of application  To continue the example above, we can impose a growth condition on a holomorphic function f that prevents it from \\"blowing up\\" and allows the Phragm√©n‚ÄìLindel√∂f principle to be applied. To this end, we now include the condition that :f(z)<\\\\exp\\\\big(A\\\\exp(c\\\\cdot\\\\Re(z))\\\\big) for some real constants c<1 and A<\\\\infty, for all z\\\\in S. It can then be shown that f(z)\\\\leq 1 for all z\\\\in\\\\partial S implies that f(z)\\\\leq 1 in fact holds for all z\\\\in S. Thus, we have the following proposition: Proposition. Let :S=\\\\Big\\\\\\\\{z:\\\\Im(z)\\\\in \\\\big(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2},\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\big)\\\\Big\\\\\\\\},\\\\quad \\\\overline{S}=\\\\Big\\\\\\\\{z:\\\\Im(z)\\\\in \\\\big[-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2},\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\big]\\\\Big\\\\\\\\}. Let f be holomorphic on S and continuous on \\\\overline{S}, and suppose there exist real constants c<1,\\\\ A<\\\\infty such that :f(z)<\\\\exp\\\\big(A\\\\exp(c\\\\cdot\\\\Re(z))\\\\big) for all z\\\\in S and f(z)\\\\leq 1 for all z\\\\in\\\\overline{S}\\\\setminus S=\\\\partial S. Then f(z)\\\\leq 1 for all z\\\\in S. Note that this conclusion fails when c=1, precisely as the motivating counterexample in the previous section demonstrates. The proof of this statement employs a typical Phragm√©n‚ÄìLindel√∂f argument: Proof: (Sketch) We fix b\\\\in(c,1) and define for each \\\\epsilon>0 the auxiliary function h_\\\\epsilon by h_\\\\epsilon(z)=e^{-\\\\epsilon(e^{b z}+e^{-b z})}. Moreover, for a given a>0, we define S_{a} to be the open rectangle in the complex plane enclosed within the vertices \\\\\\\\{a\\\\pm i\\\\pi/2,-a\\\\pm i\\\\pi/2\\\\\\\\}. Now, fix \\\\epsilon>0 and consider the function fh_\\\\epsilon. It can be shown that f(z)h_\\\\epsilon(z)\\\\to 0 as \\\\Re(z)\\\\to\\\\infty. This allows us to find an x_0 such that f(z)h_\\\\epsilon(z)\\\\leq1 whenever z\\\\in\\\\overline{S} and \\\\Re(z)\\\\geq x_0. Because S_{x_0} is a bounded region, and f(z)h_\\\\epsilon(z)\\\\leq 1 for all z\\\\in\\\\partial S_{x_0}, the maximum modulus principle implies that f(z)h_\\\\epsilon(z)\\\\leq 1 for all z\\\\in \\\\overline{S_{x_0}}. Since f(z)h_\\\\epsilon(z)\\\\leq1 whenever z\\\\in S and \\\\Re(z)> x_0, f(z)h_\\\\epsilon(z)\\\\leq1 in fact holds for all z\\\\in S. Finally, because fh_\\\\epsilon\\\\to f as \\\\epsilon\\\\to 0, we conclude that f(z)\\\\leq 1 for all z\\\\in S. ‚àé  Phragm√©n‚ÄìLindel√∂f principle for a sector in the complex plane  A particularly useful statement proved using the Phragm√©n‚ÄìLindel√∂f principle bounds holomorphic functions on a sector of the complex plane if it is bounded on its boundary. This statement can be used to give a complex analytic proof of the Hardy's uncertainty principle, which states that a function and its Fourier transform cannot both decay faster than exponentially. Proposition. Let F be a function that is holomorphic in a sector : S = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ z \\\\, \\\\big \\\\, \\\\alpha < \\\\arg z < \\\\beta \\\\right\\\\\\\\} of central angle \\\\beta-\\\\alpha=\\\\pi/\\\\lambda, and continuous on its boundary.

Special cases  In practice the point 0 is often transformed into the point ‚àû of the Riemann sphere. This gives a version of the principle that applies to strips, for example bounded by two lines of constant real part in the complex plane. This special case is sometimes known as Lindel√∂f's theorem. Carlson's theorem is an application of the principle to functions bounded on the imaginary axis.

Lochia discharge typically continues for four to six weeks after childbirth, a time known as the postpartum period or puerperium. A 2016 review ties this \\"lochial period\\" to worldwide customs of postpartum confinement, a time for the new mother and baby to bond.Sharma S, van Teijlingen E, Hundley V, Angell C, Simkhada P. Dirty and 40 days in the wilderness: Eliciting childbirth and postnatal cultural practices and beliefs in Nepal. BMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2016;16(1):147. Published July 5 2016. Lochia is sterile for the first two days, but not so by the third or fourth day, as the uterus begins to be colonized by vaginal commensals such as non-hemolytic streptococci and E. coli. Stages It progresses through three stages: #Lochia rubra (or cruenta) is the first discharge, Composed of blood, shreds of fetal membranes, decidua, vernix caseosa, lanugo and membranes. It is red in color because of the large amount of blood it contains. It lasts 1 to 4 days after birth, before easing to light \\"spotting\\". #Lochia serosa is the term for lochia that has thinned and turned brownish or pink in color. It contains serous exudate, erythrocytes, leukocytes, cervical mucus and microorganisms. This stage continues until around the tenth day after delivery. Lochia serosa which persists to some weeks after birth can indicate late postpartum hemorrhaging, and should be reported to a physician. #Lochia alba (or purulenta) is the name for lochia once it has turned whitish or yellowish-white. It typically lasts from the second through the third to sixth weeks after delivery. It contains fewer red blood cells and is mainly made up of leukocytes, epithelial cells, cholesterol, fat, mucus and microorganisms. Continuation beyond a few weeks can indicate a genital lesion, which should be reported to a physician. Complications In general, lochia has an odor similar to that of normal menstrual fluid. Any offensive odor or change to a greenish color indicates contamination by organisms such as chlamydia or saprophytic. Lochia that is retained within the uterus is known as lochiostasis or lochioschesis, and can result in lochiometra (distention of the uterus - pushing it out of shape). Lochiorrhea describes an excessive flow of lochia and can indicate infection.

Mavers was the songwriter, singer and rhythm guitarist in The La's and is best known for the hit \\"There She Goes\\" from October 1990. Mavers was originally the bassist for the Liverpool group Neuklon circa 1980 to 1984. Mavers is a passionate supporter of Everton Football Club. He is the older brother of actor Gary Mavers. The La's Mavers gained a reputation for perfectionism and eccentricity in the music press for his famed scrapping of multiple versions of the band's debut album, and often came across as dry, acerbic and stubborn in interviews, although with a clearly defined notion of music as he thought it should be: genuine, rootsy and authentic. In earlier press interviews, however, Mavers was often enthusiastic, witty, driven and informed, but he eventually became more withdrawn and caustic before choosing to drop out of the limelight altogether. This wilful shunning of the limelight has led some to portray him as a \\"recluse\\". Obsessing over the group's troubled recording efforts between 1987 and 1992, Mavers eventually retreated back to his Liverpool home after the release of the La's' eponymous debut album, his perception of the music industry soured by the fact the release was not a version of the album he wished to be made public. Mavers performing with the La's, Club Quatro, Japan 1991 More silence in the music press followed, barring one 1995 NME interview. Mavers was at this point occasionally playing with other Liverpool musicians. Mavers actively disavowed the album in print while struggling to maintain his artistic integrity. In late 2003 a book about Mavers and his band was released, In Search of the La's: A Secret Liverpool which did contain a 2000 dated interview with Mavers discussing his band and what he intends to do with his music. While providing insight into Mavers' personality, the book ends on an ambiguous note concerning his return to music. In March 2005 the La's announced dates in Britain and Ireland, their first in a decade, along with festivals sets such as Glastonbury and the Summer Sonic festival in Japan, with the line-up of Lee Mavers (vocals, guitar), John Power (bass), Jay Lewis of the band Cracatilla (guitar) and Nick Miniski (drums). The set generally consisted of old songs, including the perennial favourite \\"There She Goes\\", with new songs performed as encores. The drummer was quickly replaced by Mavers' old schoolfriend Ian Jasper, and live reviews have generally been favourable. The La's' return may have been surprising, but Mavers' attitude being completely unchanged perhaps less so ‚Äì the band are yet to conduct any interviews or features with the music press. New songs that would have featured, or will feature, on the 2nd album include \\"I Am the Key\\", \\"Fishing Net\\" A.K.A. \\"Something I Said\\", \\"Raindance\\" and \\"The Human Race\\". In March 2009, Mavers made a surprise appearance in Birmingham, joining Pete Doherty on stage to play \\"Son of a Gun\\" and \\"There She Goes\\". On 19 June 2011, Mavers made a rare outing, doing a secret acoustic set at the Deaf Institute, Manchester under the name of Lee Rude & the Velcro Underpants (a play on the names of Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground): this featured Mavers playing with Gary Murphy of defunct Liverpool band the Bandits. Mavers and Murphy continued impromptu gigs in Sunderland, Glasgow and London, before heading abroad to Amsterdam and later to the Rock En Seine Festival in Paris and at UK festivals Kendal Calling and Bestival, before bringing the 'stripped back' sets to a close at a homecoming show at Liverpool's O2 Academy after announcing they were set to return soon after recruiting a full band. An interview with Mavers also appears in the 2013 music interview book, Isle of Noises: Conversations with Great British Songwriters, by Daniel Rachel. Within the interview, Mavers discusses the themes of certain songs and his songwriting craft (essentially describing himself as a conduit rather than author), again decries the sole released LP by The La's, and also explains he has a \\"great patience\\" for the music to happen.

Biography Isshin Chiba was born in Kesennuma, Miyagi, Japan. He graduated from Miyagi Prefecture Kesennuma High School. After graduating from high school, he had the idea to become a stage actor. However, because he had no experience in such extracurricular activities in particular, he attended Katsuma Voice Actor's Academy in Tokyo. He started his career as a voice actor at age 22 in 1990. In 1997, he landed the role for which he is best known, the role of Jin Kazama from the Tekken fighting game series. Starting from Tekken 3, he voiced Jin in all other Tekken games, including crossovers Namco √ó Capcom, Street Fighter X Tekken, Project X Zone, Project X Zone 2 and adaptations Tekken: Blood Vengeance and the Japanese dub of the live-action Tekken film.

The ship was named for Sonarman Third Class Franklin Alexander McGinty, who was killed aboard the gunboat on 5 August 1943. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism without regard for his own safety. McGintys keel was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation of Orange, Texas on 3 May 1944. She was launched on 5 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Perrillah Atkinson Malone and commissioned at Orange on 25 September 1944, with Lieutenant Commander William H. Harrison in command. History =World War II= After a shakedown cruise off Bermuda and training along the US east coast, McGinty departed Norfolk, Virginia on 4 December 1944 for escort duty in the western Pacific. As flagship for Escort Division 86, she touched at San Diego, California, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii before reaching Eniwetok on 16 January 1945. Later that day, she continued on to Guam as convoy escort duty. During the next 3 months, she escorted ships from Eniwetok to Guam and Ulithi. She completed three round trips between Eniwetok and Guam and two between Eniwetok and Ulithi, escorting tankers, transports, escort carriers, and merchant ships. McGinty arrived at Ulithi on 27 April and served there as patrol ship until 15 June. After a run to Guam and back, she sailed in convoy for Okinawa, Japan on 1 July. She returned to Ulithi via Saipan on 12th, and completed a similar run to the Palau Islands and back on 23 July. She departed on a second Okinawa run on 4 August and returned to Ulithi on V-J Day. Thence, between 22 and 26 August, she sailed to Okinawa for duty with the 5th Fleet. On 9 September, McGinty sailed in the screen of a minesweeping and evacuation force bound for Japan. She arrived in Wakayama, Honsh≈´, on the 11th and supported the evacuation of POWs before sailing for Okinawa on 18 September. She returned to Wakayama a week later and resumed her support of occupation operations along the Honsh≈´ coast. During the next two months, she escorted ships between the Inland Sea and Tokyo Bay, served as a harbor entrance control ship in the swept channel of Bungo Suido, and made courier runs out of Wakayama. Departing Japan on 2 January 1946, McGinty sailed via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor to San Francisco, California, where she arrived on 22 January. She steamed to San Diego 23 and 24 March, was decommissioned there on 15 January 1947, and was berthed in the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. =Korean War= Following the outbreak of Communist aggression in South Korea, McGinty was recommissioned at San Diego on 28 March 1951, with Lieutenant Commander Frederick W. Pennoyer in command. She carried out intensive training along the west coast and at Pearl Harbor. Then, as flagship of Escort Squadron 11, she sailed east on 29 October. Arriving in Korean waters on 21 November, she began blockade and patrol duty in Wonsan Harbor and in a naval-gunfire role, conducted numerous shore bombardments of Communist-held positions. She returned to Japan in mid- December, and joined the 7th Fleet patrols of the Straits of Formosa on 6 January 1952. She returned to the east coast of the war-torn Korean Peninsula, and between 5 March and 29 April, she carried out two more blockade and bombardment deployments at Wonsan. She departed Japan on 15 May and returned to her home port at Pearl Harbor on 24 May. During the next year, McGinty prepared for additional western Pacific duty. After arriving in Sasebo, Japan on 20 May 1953, she resumed patrol duty along the east coast of Korea and screened ships during at-sea replenishment operations. Following the cessation of hostilities, she continued peacekeeping patrols and took part in anti- submarine warfare exercises. Once done, she departed Korean waters. =Cold War= On 17 November 1954 McGinty sailed on her third Cold War deployment to the Far East. During the remainder of the year, she patrolled the Sea of Japan off Korea, and on 1 January 1955, she transferred this peacekeeping duty to ships of the Republic of Korea‚Äôs Navy in a ceremony at Pusan. She continued to support ‚Äúkeeping the peace‚Äù missions of the 7th Fleet. In February 1955, she served in the screen for the Mobile Replenishment Group, which supported the 7th Fleet during the timely and successful evacuation of the Tachen Islands. This display of U.S. seapower permitted the removal of Chinese Nationalists from an untenable position on the coastal islands along the mainland of China, and was called ‚Äúthe most forthright U.S. action against communism since the Korean War.‚Äù McGinty returned to Pearl Harbor from the western Pacific on 23 May and conducted type and squadron operations from Pearl Harbor during the remainder of 1955. Between April and July 1956, she supported United States nuclear testing programs in the Marshall Islands, serving both as a survey and a search and rescue ship. She then returned to Pearl Harbor for duty in the Hawaiian area until 17 June 1957, when she sailed to rejoin the 7th Fleet. For more than four months, she ranged the western Pacific from the Marianas and the Philippines to Australia and Japan. She arrived back at Pearl Harbor on 5 November. On 7 June 1958 McGinty began her fifth Far East deployment of the decade. While operating in the Marianas, she joined Escort Squadron 7 on 1 July. Between 15 September and 12 October, she patrolled the northern station of the Taiwan Strait with other ships of the 7th Fleet. This timely demonstration thwarted the possible Communist invasion of the Chinese Nationalist islands of Quemoy and Matsu. McGinty steamed to Seattle, Washington from 3 to 9 January 1959. She was decommissioned at Portland, Oregon, on 19 September 1959 and was assigned to ResCortDiv 13. She was placed in service as a Group II selected reserve destroyer escort. Manned by a reserve crew, she performed vital training duty for Naval Reserves. In response to overt Communist pressures by East Germany against West Berlin, McGinty was mobilized by Presidential order on 25 August 1961, and recommissioned on 2 October 1961, with Commander Jerome E. Aakhus in command. McGinty sailed to Pearl Harbor, and as flagship for Escort Squadron 7, trained in Hawaiian waters until departing for the western Pacific on 10 February 1962. She bolstered the peacekeeping efforts of the versatile 7th Fleet while cruising the Far East from the South China Sea to the Sea of Japan. She returned to Portland on 17 July, decommissioned on 1 August 1962, and resumed in service duty as a training ship for Naval Reserves. Operating out of Portland, McGinty provided valuable service as a training ground to maintain the operational and combat readiness of reservists. In addition, she took part in summer training exercises in Hawaiian waters and along the west coast. While remaining ready to meet the threats to world peace from Communist aggression and subversion, she also responded promptly to the menace of natural disasters. During a flood which affected much of Oregon and portions of northern California in late December 1964, she provided material assistance to emergency teams and lifesaving missions in the stricken areas. =Decommissioning= McGinty was transferred to the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Bremerton, Washington, on 23 September 1968. Her name was struck from the Navy List the same day, and she was sold for scrap on 27 October 1969. Honors McGinty received three battle stars for her Korean War service.

It is in Ban Chang District of Rayong Province. It also serves as the U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, home of the Royal Thai Navy First Air Wing. U-Tapao is the home of a large Thai Airways maintenance facility, servicing that airline's aircraft as well as those of other customers. Due to the blockade of Bangkok's airports by opposition protesters, U-Tapao briefly became the main air gateway to Thailand between 26 November and 5 December 2008. As both of Bangkok's international airports essential to the country's tourist boom are operating beyond capacity as of 2015, U-Tapao in particular has been eyed as an alternate international gateway due to its relative proximity to the capital. Location U-Tapao lies approximately southeast of Bangkok, south of Sukhumvit Road at Km. 189, near Sattahip on the Gulf of Thailand, about a 45-minute drive from Pattaya (Thailand's most popular beach resort). History =Vietnam War= U-Tapao was built by the United States to accommodate B-52 bombers for missions in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia during the Vietnam War. Construction began on 15 October 1965 and was completed on 2 June 1966. U-Tapao was the primary Southeast Asian airfield for US Air Force B-52 Stratofortress bombers, called \\"Bee-hasip-sawng\\" (B-52) by the local Thais. U-Tapao was a front-line base along with the other US bases at Korat, Udon, Ubon, Nakhon Phanom, and Takhli. The USAF B-52s made regular sorties over North Vietnam and North Vietnamese-controlled areas in Laos, carrying an average of 108 500-pound and 750-pound bombs per mission. U-Tapao was a regular stop on Bob Hope's Christmas shows for the troops. =November 2008 protests in Bangkok= With the temporary closure of Suvarnabhumi Airport and Don Mueang Airport in late November 2008 because they had been occupied by anti-government protestors, U-Tapao became for a time Thailand's main supplementary international gateway. Many airlines arranged special flights to and from U-Tapao to ferry international passengers stranded by the closure of the Suvarnabhumi Airport.Page 6, South China Morning Post, 30 November 2008. Several governments including Italy, Macau and Spain also sent chartered flights to evacuate residents. As many as 100,000 passengers were stranded in Thailand until early December. Although its runway can accommodate large aircraft, U-Tapao's terminals are not designed to handle more than a few flights a day. Travellers were subject to many hardships, and as the security was not up-to-date, some US-bound flights were diverted to Japan and their passengers required to go through a supplementary security check before continuing. =Airport expansion= As Bangkok's two international airports are operating beyond capacity, the government intends to turn U-Tapao into a third major destination for airlines. A new second terminal, which will increase airport capacity from 800,000 to three million persons per year. Terminal 2 was partially opened in November 2018 and was officially opened in February 2019. There are also 41 direct flights landing from China weeklyhttp://www.utapao.com/ with more airlines scheduled to announce soon. Airport director, Rear Adm Worapol Tongpricha, said the 620 million baht terminal is the start of a three-year, first-phase development. In the second phase, the government will boost the capacity further to 15 million people. Concessions In late-2018, King Power was awarded a ten-year contract to operate U-Tapao duty-free shops. A partnership between Thai retailer Central Department Store Company (Central Group) and DFS Group will manage retail shops and services, mainly food and beverage, also for 10 years.

From the very outset, a special dedication to the mystery of the Holy Trinity has been a constitutive element of the order's life. Papal documents refer to the founder only as Brother John, but tradition identifies him as Saint John de Matha, whose feast day is celebrated on 17 December. The founding-intention for the order was the ransom of Christians held captive by Muslims, a consequence of crusading and of pirating along the Mediterranean coast of Europe. The Order has the initials \\"O.SS.T.\\" Its distinctive cross of red and blue can be traced to its beginnings. Background 14th century Trinitarian cross at St Robert's Church, Pannal Between the eighth and the fifteenth centuries medieval Europe was in a state of intermittent warfare between the Christian kingdoms of southern Europe and the Muslim polities of North Africa, Southern France, Sicily and portions of Spain. According to James W. Brodman, the threat of capture, whether by pirates or coastal raiders, or during one of the region's intermittent wars, was a continuous threat to residents of Catalonia, Languedoc, and the other coastal provinces of medieval Christian Europe.Brodman, James William, Ransoming Captives in Crusader Spain:The Order of Merced on the Christian-Islamic Frontier, 1986 Raids by militias, bands, and armies from both sides was an almost annual occurrence.Ibn Khaldun, Histoire des Berb√®res et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique septentrionale, ed. Paul Casanova and Henri P√©r√®s, trans. William MacGuckin, baron de Slane (Paris, 1925-56), 3: 116-17 The redemption of captives is listed among the corporal works of mercy. The period of the Crusades, when so many Christians were in danger of falling into the hands of Muslims, witnessed the rise of religious orders vowed exclusively to this pious work. History Juan Carre√±o de Miranda. Founding of Trinitarian Order (Mass of St John of Matha) The Order of the Trinitarians (Order of the Holy Trinity and Captives) was founded by St. John de Matha after his vision of Christ with two captives around 1193.Henry Charles Lea, 2002, A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church, Adamant Media Corp. page 497The Order of the Holy Trinity and Captives: Andrew Witko 2008 Pope Innocent III granted the order and its rule approval with his letter Operante divine dispositionis clementia, issued on 17 December 1198. Soon after papal approbation, the Trinitarian ministry to Christian captives was incorporated into the Order's title: Order of the Holy Trinity and of Captives. In addition to the Order's purpose of ransoming Christian captives, each local community of Trinitarians served the people of its area. And so, their ministry included hospitality, care of the sick and poor, churches, education, etc. Eventually, the Trinitarians also assumed the work of evangelization. Brother John's founding intention expanded quickly beyond the three initial foundations (Cerfroid, Planels, Bourg-la-Reine) into a considerable network of houses committed to the ransom of Christian captives and the works of mercy conducted in their locales. Trinitarian tradition considers St. Felix of Valois co-founder of the Order and companion of John of Matha at Cerfroid, near Paris. In Cerfroid the first Trinitarian community was established and it is considered the mother house of the whole Order. The first generation of Trinitarians could count some fifty foundations. In northern France, the Trinitarians were known as ‚ÄúMathurins‚Äù because they were based in the church of Saint-Mathurin in Paris from 1228 onwards.Alban Butler, Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000), 5. Ransoming captives required economic resources. Fundraising and economic expertise constituted important aspects of the Order's life. The Rule's requirement of \\"the tertia pars\\", or setting aside one-third of all income for the ransom of Christian captives, became a noted characteristic of the Order. Louis IX installed a house of their order in his ch√¢teau of Fontainebleau. He chose Trinitarians as his chaplains, and was accompanied by them on his crusades. The Master of the Trinity was taken captive together with Saint Louis after the Battle of Al Mansurah.Jean de Joinville Memoirs of Louis IX Throughout the centuries, the Trinitarian Rule underwent several revisions, notably in 1267 and in 1631. It has been complemented by statutes and constitutions. The thirteenth century was a time of vitality, whereas the following centuries brought periods of difficulty and even decline in some areas. The Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563) was a major turning-point in the life of the Church. Its twenty-fifth session dealt with regulars and nuns and the reform of religious orders. Reforming interests and energies manifested themselves among Trinitarians in France with the foundation at Pontoise, north of Paris, during the last quarter of the sixteenth century. Reform-minded Trinitarians in Spain first established the movement known as the Recollection and then, under the leadership of St. John Baptist of the Conception, a movement at Valdepe√±as (Ciudad Real) known as the Spanish Discalced Trinitarians at the very end of the sixteenth century. Far- reaching periods of growth and development followed this rebirth. Stone shield of the Trinitarian Order on the fa√ßade of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (1638-1641) in Rome. In succeeding centuries, European events such as revolution, government suppression and civil war had very serious consequences for the Trinitarian Order and it declined significantly. During the last decades of the nineteenth century, the Trinitarians began to grow slowly in Italy and Spain. Its members dedicated themselves to fostering and promoting devotion to the Holy Trinity, evangelising non-Christians, assisting immigrants, educating the young, and to parish work. The Trinitarian Family Today the Trinitarian family is composed of priests, brothers, women (cloistered nuns and active sisters) as well as committed laity. Members of the Trinitarian family include the Trinitarian religious; the Trinitarian contemplative nuns; the Trinitarian Sisters of Valence; the Trinitarian Sisters of Rome, Valencia, Madrid, Mallorca, and Seville; the Oblates of the Most Holy Trinity; the Third Order Secular (tertiaries) and other Trinitarian laity. All are distinguished by the cross of red and blue which dates from the origins of the Order. Trinitarians are found throughout Europe and in the Americas as well as in Africa, India, Korea and the Philippines. In 2000 the Vatican Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life approved ‚ÄúThe Trinitarian Way‚Äù rule of life which would guide all the lay groups associated with the Trinitarians: the Third Order Secular, the Trinitarian Movement, Confraternities, etc. Like the Jesuits, Trinitarians also pledge not to seek promotion within the Church hierarchy. If promotion is offered, however, it is accepted. Charism The Glory of the Most Holy Trinity and the ransom of Christian Captives. Along with the Order‚Äôs mission of ransoming Christian captives, each Trinitarian Community served the people of its area by performing works of mercy; redemption and mercy are at the center of the Trinitarian charism. Our Lady of Good Remedy Our Lady of Good Remedy is the patroness of the Order of the Most Holy Trinity. Devotion to Mary under this ancient title is widely known in Europe and Latin America. Her feast day is celebrated on 8 October. Scapular of the Most Blessed Trinity The Scapular of the Holy Trinity is a devotional scapular associated with the Confraternity of The Holy Trinity and the Third Order Secular of the Most Holy Trinity. It is a white scapular with a cross of which the transverse shaft is blue and the longitudinal shaft red. It is worn by Tertiaries as well as members of the Confraternity of the Blessed Trinity (or other Trinitarian associations that make use of the scapular) after investment with this scapular. It is a sign of consecration to the Holy Trinity and of fraternity.

It is bounded on the east by Spencer Gulf, the west by the Great Australian Bight, and the north by the Gawler Ranges. It is named after explorer Edward John Eyre who explored parts of the peninsula in 1839-1841. The coastline was first charted by the expeditions of Matthew Flinders in 1801-1802 and French explorer Nicolas Baudin around the same time. The peninsula's economy is primarily agricultural, with growing aquaculture, mining and tourism sectors. The main townships are Port Lincoln in the south, Whyalla and Port Augusta in the north east, and Ceduna in the northwest.  Naming and extent  The peninsula was named after explorer Edward John Eyre on 7 November 1839 by George Gawler, second Governor of South Australia. The peninsula's coastline boundary was defined in 1839 as ‚ÄúSpencer's Gulf in its whole length, to the southern ocean from Cape Catastrophe to the western point of Denial Bay.‚Äù Its northern boundary was described in 1978 as follows: ‚Äúno official boundary [has] ever [been] proclaimed but the common sense choice would be to draw a straight line from Yorkey Crossing to the northernmost point of Denial Bay.‚Äô‚Äô  Population  As at 30 June 2010, the peninsula had a population of 58,700 people. The peninsula is home to 3.6% of South Australia's population. 2,500 people, 4.4% of the population, is estimated to be indigenous.\\"Regional Development Australia Whyalla & Eyre Peninsula Fact Sheet\\" South Australian Centre for Economic Studies, South Australia (2012). Eyre Peninsula towns and cities with a population of more than 500 (Australian census 2011) Economy =Primary industries= The major industry is farming - cereal crops, sheep, and cattle in the drier north and more water-intensive activities such as dairy farming and a growing wine industry in the south. Many coastal towns have commercial fishing fleets, the largest being located at Port Lincoln. The town has previously harbored a large tuna-fishing fleet, which is gradually transforming its practice to fish farming with the growth of sea cage aquaculture. Oyster farming was established in the 1980s and occurs in several sheltered bays including Franklin Harbour (near Cowell in Spencer Gulf) and Smoky Bay off the west coast. =Mining= Banded iron formation, South Middleback Range, Eyre Peninsula. Orangish-brown = quartz mixed with limonite. Silvery-gray = hematite. Iron ore is mined by Arrium in the Middleback Range near Iron Knob, inland from Whyalla. Some of the product is smelted to produce feedstock for the Whyalla Steelworks. Increasing volumes of iron ore are also being exported from Whyalla directly to customers in Asia.

The peninsula has many small inactive mines and quarries, and is considered prospective for a variety of minerals, including graphite, coal and uranium with many deposits being proven in recent years. The 2000s saw increased mineral exploration activity on the peninsula. In 2013, some of the more advanced mine development projects included: Ironclad Mining Ltd's Wilcherry Hill, Centrex Metals Ltd's Fusion Magnetite Project and Iron Road Ltd's Central Eyre Iron Project. Shortfalls in existing rail, power and water supply infrastructure continue to hamper new project development. =Tourism= Tourists can cage-dive with great white sharks off Eyre Peninsula. Murphy's Haystacks are a unique geological feature. The Eyre Peninsula is promoted by Regional Development Australia Whyalla and Eyre Peninsula as the 'Seafood Frontier' due to the variety of seafood species found in the region, both farmed and wild-caught. Key species are the southern bluefin tuna and yellowtail kingfish, which are farmed in Port Lincoln and Arno Bay, and Pacific oysters, which are grown in Coffin Bay, Cowell, Denial Bay, Smoky Bay and Streaky Bay. Other seafood offerings include abalone, King George whiting, mussels, western king prawns and blue swimmer crabs. Many natural heritage attractions can be found in the peninsula's three national parks, in numerous conservation parks, and along the peninsula's extensive coastline. Ecotourism operators offer visitors opportunities to experience many of the peninsula's iconic marine species either in or on the water. From Whyalla, visitors can snorkel or dive off Point Lowly to witness the mass breeding aggregation of giant Australian cuttlefish which occurs there from May to August each year. From Port Lincoln, tourists can swim in a cage with southern bluefin tuna, with a colony of Australian sea lions, or enter a shark cage to observe great white sharks offshore near the Neptune Islands. Ceduna lies to the east of the Nullarbor Plain, which is crossed by a stretch of the Eyre Highway running parallel to the Great Australian Bight. Oyster farm tours can be experienced at Smoky Bay allowing visitors to see where oysters are grown. Recreational fishing for species such as King George whiting and blue swimmer crabs does not require a licence, although size, bag, and boat limits may apply.Recreational fishing, South Australian Department of Primary Industries and Regions (PIRSA). Retrieved 15 September 2020. On the west coast, tourists can snorkel with Australian sea lions and bottlenose dolphins in the sheltered waters of Baird Bay, and observe southern right whales (and occasionally humpback whales) from the shore or by boat from Fowler's Bay from May to October. Murphy's Haystacks are a unique geographical feature, located between Streaky Bay and Port Kenny. Artefacts from the Peninsula's pioneer and, to a lesser extent, indigenous heritage can be seen at a network of museums operated by the National Trust of South Australia, which include the Mount Laura Homestead Museum in Whyalla, the Tumby Bay National Trust Museum and the Koppio Smithy Museum. The Whyalla Maritime Museum has a nautical theme which commemorates the former Whyalla shipyards. Its displays include the World War II corvette , which sits in dry- dock and is visible from the Lincoln Highway. Fishing charters are offered departing from many coastal towns, including Whyalla, Cowell, Tumby Bay and Port Lincoln.  Transport  =Road= Highway map of South Australia including highways on the Eyre Peninsula identified by their route number Major population centres on the peninsula are connected by a network of highways. The Eyre Highway (Route number A1) runs east‚Äìwest across the north side of the peninsula, while the Flinders Highway (Route number B100) and Lincoln Highway (Route number A100) follow the west and east coasts, meeting at Port Lincoln in the south. The Tod Highway (Route number B90) bisects the peninsula, running south‚Äìnorth from Port Lincoln through the town of Lock to meet the Eyre Highway at Kyancutta. The Birdseye Highway (Route number B91) bisects the peninsula from Elliston on the west coast and Flinders Highway through Lock and Cleve to the Lincoln Highway near Cowell. =Rail= The peninsula is served by the isolated Eyre Peninsula Railway. Peaking at 777 kilometres in 1950 radiating out from the ports at Port Lincoln and Thevenard, today only one 60 kilometre section remains open. It is operated by Genesee & Wyoming Australia. It has always been isolated from the main network.

Presently, water is pumped several hundred kilometres from the Murray River to the town of Whyalla through the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline. Underground water resources are suffering from gradually increasing salinity. The only reliable surface flows are from the Tod River and its main tributary, Pillaworta Creek, which are captured by the Tod Reservoir. The reservoir was built to augment the groundwater supply of Port Lincoln and was constructed in the early 1920s. It was taken offline in the early 2000s due to concerns over rising salinity and contamination from agricultural chemicals. SA Water has investigated potential locations for seawater desalination plants to address future water security problems. As of January 2014, no plants are proposed to be built for domestic or agricultural supply, though one currently exists and two have been proposed to serve the mining industry exclusively. The existing plant is located at Whyalla and is operated by Arrium and plants are proposed for Point Lowly and Lipson Cove to serve BHP Billiton and Centrex Metals respectively. Administrative divisions =Local government areas= The peninsula includes the local government areas of Ceduna, Cleve, Elliston, Franklin Harbour, Kimba, Lower Eyre Peninsula, Port Lincoln, Streaky Bay, Tumby Bay, Wudinna and Whyalla, as well as the western portion of the City of Port Augusta. The area at the northern end of the peninsula is within the Pastoral Unincorporated Area of South Australia where municipal services are provided by the Outback Communities Authority to communities, including Iron Knob. =State and federal electorates= The peninsula is within the boundaries of the federal division of Grey and the state electoral districts of Flinders and Giles. =Regions= The peninsula is within the extent of the following two South Australian government regions - the Eyre Western and the Far North.

Among the most famous composers of the era, he was influential in developing the musical form of the suite of dances in his keyboard works. His harpsichord pieces are highly idiomatic and programmatic. Only two of Froberger's many compositions were published during his lifetime. Froberger forbade publication of his manuscripts, restricting access to his noble patrons and friends, particularly the W√ºrttembergs and Habsburgs who had the power to enforce these restrictions. After his death the manuscripts went to his patroness Sibylla, Duchess of W√ºrttemberg (1620‚Äì1707) and the music library of the W√ºrttemberg family estate.  Life  = 1616‚Äì1634: Early years in Stuttgart = Johann Jakob Froberger was baptized on 19 May 1616 in Stuttgart. The exact date of his birth is unknown. His family came from Halle, where his grandfather Simon livedSchott, Grove and his father Basilius (1575‚Äì1637) was born. In 1599 Basilius moved to Stuttgart and became a tenor in the W√ºrttemberg court chapel. At some point before 1605 he married Anna Schmid (1577‚Äì1637), who came from a Schwabian family living in Stuttgart. By the time Johann Jakob was born, his father's career was already flourishing, and in 1621 Basilius became court Kapellmeister. Of his eleven children with Anna, four became musicians (Johann Jakob, Johann Christoph, Johann Georg and Isaac; all but Johann Jakob served at the W√ºrttemberg court in StuttgartSee J. Sittard: \\"Zur Geschichte der Musik und des Theaters am W—årttembergischen Hofe\\" (Stuttgart, 1890‚Äì91/R)), and so it is likely that Johann Jakob received his first music lessons from his father. Although the Thirty Years' War which started in 1618 undoubtedly made life in Stuttgart somewhat more difficult, the city's musical life was rich and varied, influenced by musicians from all over Europe, so already at the very beginning of his life Froberger must have been exposed to a wide variety of musical traditions. Little is known about his actual education, though. His teachers possibly included Johann Ulrich Steigleder, and he might have met Samuel Scheidt during the latter's visit to Stuttgart in 1627; it is possible that Froberger sang in the court chapel, but there is no direct evidence to that; and court archives indicate that one of the English lutenists employed by the court, Andrew Borell, taught lute to one of Basilius Froberger's sons in 1621‚Äì22 ‚Äì it is not known whether this son was Johann Jakob, but if so, it would explain his later interest in French lute music. Basilius Froberger's music library probably also helped in Johann Jakob's education. It contained more than a hundred volumes of music, including works by Josquin des Prez,G. B. Sharp. \\"J. J. Froberger: 1614‚Äì1667: A Link between the Renaissance and the Baroque\\". The Musical Times, Vol. 108, No. 1498 (Dec., 1967), pp. 1093-1095+1097 Samuel Scheidt and Michael Praetorius, as well as pieces by the lesser known Johann Staden, founder of the Nuremberg school, and Giovanni Valentini, the then-famous Viennese Kapellmeister who later taught Johann Kaspar Kerll.Siedentopf Henning. \\"Johan Jakob Froberger\\". Stuttgarter Verlagkontor, Stuttgart 1977, p. 26-30. See for a complete list. = 1634‚Äì1649: Court service in Vienna and voyages to Italy = The Hofkapelle Stuttgart was disbanded in 1634 in the wake of the Protestants' defeat in the Battle of N√∂rdlingen. In Grundlage einer Ehrenpforte (1740) Mattheson writes that a certain Swedish ambassador was so impressed with Froberger's musical skills that he took the 18-year-old musician to Vienna and presumably recommended him to the imperial court. This seems unlikely, however, because at the time Sweden was allied with Lutheran W√ºrttemberg against the imperial forces; so exactly why Froberger left for Vienna at around 1634 and how he managed to find employment as a singer in the imperial chapel, remains a mystery. In 1637 Basilius Froberger, his wife and one of his daughters died of plague. Johann Jakob and his brother Isaac sold their father's music library to the W√ºrttemberg court (this is how the contents of Basilius' library became known ‚Äì through the court archives); the same year Johann Jakob became court organist in Vienna, assisting Wolfgang Ebner. In June he was granted a leave and a stipend to go to Rome to study under Frescobaldi. Froberger spent the next three years in Italy and, like many other musicians who went to study there, apparently converted to Catholicism. He returned to Vienna in 1641 and served as organist and chamber musician until the fall of 1645, when he took a second trip to Italy. It was previously thought that Froberger went to study under Giacomo Carissimi, but recent research shows that he most probably studied with Athanasius Kircher in Rome.C. Annibaldi: ‚ÄòFroberger in Rome: from Frescobaldi‚Äôs Craftsmanship to Kircher‚Äôs Compositional Secrets‚Äô, CMc, no.58 (1995), 5‚Äì27 If so, Froberger's intention must have been acquiring mastery of vocal composition of the prima pratica (Frescobaldi, who taught him instrumental writing, died in 1643). Sometime during 1648‚Äì49 Froberger might have met Johann Kaspar Kerll, and possibly taught him. In 1649 Froberger travelled back to Austria. On his way back he stopped in Florence and Mantua to show the arca musurgica, a powerful compositional device Kircher taught him, to some of the Italian princes. In September he arrived in Vienna and demonstrated the arca musurgica to the Emperor, an avid amateur musician; he also presented him with Libro Secondo, a collection of his own compositions (the Libro Primo is now lost). Also in September, Froberger played before William Swann, an English diplomat. Through Swann he got to know Constantijn Huygens, who became Froberger's lifelong friend and introduced the composer to works by contemporary French masters ‚Äì Jacques Champion de Chambonni√®res, Denis Gaultier and Ennemond Gaultier. = 1649‚Äì1653: Years of travels = Following the Empress Maria Leopoldine's death in August the court's musical activities were suspended. Froberger left the city and travelled widely for the next four years, likely entrusted by the Emperor with some extra-musical duties in the fields of diplomacy and possibly espionage (as for example John Dowland and Peter Paul Rubens were doing during their travels). Not much is known about these voyages. Dresden was probably one of the first cities Froberger visited: he played before the electoral court of John George I and presented the Elector with a collection of his works. He also met Matthias Weckmann while in Dresden, and this encounter turned to another lifelong friendship; the two continued to exchange letters and Froberger even sent some of his music to Weckmann to illustrate his style. According to a pupil, after Dresden Froberger visited Cologne, D√ºsseldorf, Zeeland, Brabant and Antwerp; we also know that he also visited Brussels at least two times (in 1650 and 1652), London (after a disastrous voyage during which Froberger got robbed, an event he described musically in Plainte faite √† Londres pour passer la m√©lancholie) and, most importantly, Paris (at least once, in 1652). In Paris Froberger most probably became acquainted with many major French composers of the era, including Chambonni√®res, Louis Couperin, Denis Gaultier and possibly Fran√ßois Dufault. The latter two were famous lutenists writing in the characteristic French idiom of style bris√©, which influenced Froberger's later harpsichord suites. In turn, Louis Couperin was profoundly influenced by Froberger's style; one of his unmeasured preludes even bears the subtitle \\"√† l'imitation de Mr. Froberger\\". In November 1652 Froberger witnessed the death of the famed lutenist Blancrocher (who was his friend and reportedly died in his arms). Although Blancrocher himself was not an important composer,Bruce K. Burchmore. \\"Fleury, Charles, Sieur de Blancrocher [Blanrocher, Blancheroche], Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy\\" his death left a mark on the history of music, as Couperin, Gaultier, Dufaut and Froberger all wrote tombeaux lamenting the event. = 1653‚Äì1667: Last years in Vienna, retirement and death = In 1653 Froberger passed through Heidelberg, Nuremberg and Regensburg before returning to Vienna in April. He remained with the Viennese court during the next four years, producing at least one more collection of music, the Libro Quarto of 1656 (Libro Terzo is now lost). Froberger was apparently deeply saddened by Emperor Ferdinand III's death on 2 April 1657 and wrote a lamentation dedicated to the memory of the Emperor. His relationship with Ferdinand's successor, Leopold I, was strained for a number of political reasons (numerous forces were opposed to Leopold's election, and among them were the Jesuit order and Johann Philipp von Sch√∂nborn, Elector-Archbishop of Mainz; Froberger's mentor and friend Kircher was an important figure in the former, and Froberger had strong ties with the court of the latter. Froberger did, however, dedicate a new volume of his works to Leopold), and on June 30, 1657 Froberger received his last salary as a member of the imperial chapel. Little is known about Froberger's last 10 years. Most of the information comes from the letter exchange between Constantijn Huygens and the dowager Duchess of Montb√©liard, Sybilla (1620‚Äì1707). Since the death of her husband L√©opold- Fr√©d√©ric of W√ºrttemberg-Montb√©liard in 1662 the Duchess lived in H√©ricourt (near Montb√©liard, then territory of the house of W√ºrttemberg; now d√©partement Doubs), and Froberger became her music teacher at around the same time (this indicates that Froberger must have maintained a link with the ducal family of W√ºrttemberg since his Stuttgart years). He lived in Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôH√©ricourt, the dower house of Duchess Sibylla. The Huygens-Sybilla letters indicate that in 1665 Froberger travelled to Mainz, where he performed at the court of the Elector-Archbishop of Mainz and met Huygens in person for the first time; and at a certain point in 1666 the composer had plans to return to the imperial court in Vienna. As far as is known, though, he never did, and lived in H√©ricourt until his death on 6 or 7 May 1667. Froberger apparently knew that he was going to die soon, as he made all necessary preparations a day before he died. Works =General information= The fourth suite from one of the Vienna manuscripts. Only two compositions by Froberger were published during his lifetime: the Hexachord Fantasia, published by Kircher in 1650 in Rome, and a piece in Fran√ßois Roberday's Fugues et caprices (1660, Paris). In addition to these, a comparatively large number of works are preserved in authenticated manuscripts. The three principal sources for Froberger's music are the following manuscripts: * Libro Secundo (1649) and Libro Quarto (1656), two richly decorated volumes dedicated to Ferdinand III. Both were found in Vienna; the decorations and calligraphy are by Johann Friedrich Sautter, Froberger's friend from his Stuttgart years. Each book has four chapters and contains 24 pieces. Both include six toccatas and six suites; Libro Secundo adds 6 fantasias and 6 canzonas, whereas Libro Quarto instead has 6 ricercars and 6 capriccios. * Libro di capricci e ricercate (c. 1658). 6 capriccios and 6 ricercars. Also, in 2006 an autograph manuscript was discovered (and subsequently sold at Sotheby's to an anonymus bidder), reportedly containing 35 pieces of music, 18 of which were previously unknown and remain unedited. The manuscript dates from Froberger's final years and may contain his last compositions., , Three toccatas in Ms. Chigi Q.IV.25 very likely are early Froberger compositions while he studied with Frescobaldi, as Bob van Asperen has argued in 2009.Bob van Asperen: >Drei Toccaten< in der Handschrift Chigi Q.IV.25, in: Concerto 224, K√∂ln 2009, pp.34-41 Other than these, numerous manuscripts of various origin contain Froberger's music. These include the well-known Bauyn manuscript, and a very large number of less known sources, some reliable (such as the only unbowdlerized text for M√©ditation sur ma mort future, presumably in Weckmann's hand, or the Strasbourg manuscript of some couple of dozen of suites, possibly compiled by Michael Bulyowsky) and some not very much so. Problems arise with many of the newly discovered copies: either Froberger was constantly reworking his compositions, or the scribes were not attentive enough, but many works exist in several variants, some of which even have whole movements changed. Two standard numbering systems are used to identify Froberger's works. These are: * the numbers used in the early 20th century Denkm√§ler der Tonkunst in √ñsterreich series and the Guido Adler edition; commonly referred to as the DT√ñ numbers or the Adler numbers. This catalogue has separate numbering for different genres, with pieces identified as Toccata No. 4, Ricercare No. 2, Suite No. 20, etc. The DT√ñ contains a few compositions falsely attributed to Froberger, and some identical ones. * FbWV numbers from the Siegbert Rampe catalogue compiled in the early 1990s. Rampe's catalogue is more complete and includes newly discovered pieces as well as pieces whose authorship is questioned. The Adler numbers are incorporated, for example all Toccatas are numbered 1xx, hence Adler Toccata No. 1 has the Rampe number FbWV 101. For more information, see List of compositions by Johann Jakob Froberger. =Harpsichord suites and programmatic pieces= One of the toccatas from the Vienna manuscripts. Froberger is usually credited as the creator of the Baroque suite. While this may be misleading, French composers of the time did group dance pieces by tonality above all,Alexander Silbiger. \\"Keyboard Music to 1700\\". Routledge 2004, second edition, p. 189 and while other composers such as Kindermann did try to invent some kind of organisation, their dances did not attain as high a degree of artistic merit as seen in Froberger's suites. The typical Froberger suite established allemande, courante, sarabande and gigue as the obligatory parts of a suite. However, there is some controversy surrounding the placement of the gigue. In Froberger's earliest authenticated autograph, Libro Secondo, five out of six suites are in three movements, without the gigue. A single suite, no. 2, has a gigue added as a 4th movement (and a later copy adds gigues to suites nos. 3 and 5). The suites of Libro Quarto all have gigues as the 2nd movement. The order that became the standard after Froberger's death, with the gigue being the last movement, first appeared in a 1690s print of Froberger's works by the Amsterdam publisher Mortier. All Froberger's dances are composed of two repeated sections, but they are very rarely in the standard 8+8 bars scheme. When symmetrical structure is employed, it may be 7+7 bars or 11+11 bars; more frequently one of the sections is longer or shorter than the other (more often the second is shorter than the first). This irregularity may be employed by Froberger in any dance, whereas in Chambonni√®res, who used similarly irregular patterns, the sarabande is always composed in the 8+16 fashion. Froberger's keyboard adaptation of the French lute style bris√© almost invariably shows itself in most pieces written during and after his Paris visit. Froberger's allemandes abandon the original dance's rhythmic scheme almost completely, abounding in short gestures, figures, ornaments and runs typical of style bris√©. Like Chambonni√®res, Froberger avoids emphasizing internal cadences, or indeed anything that would hint at any sort of regularity;Apel, 557 unlike him, Froberger tends to use faster sixteenth-note figurations and melodies. Most of the courantes are in 6/4 time with occasional hemiolas and the eighth- note motion typical of the courante. Some of the others, however, are in 3/2 time, twice slower and moving in quarter notes. Still others are in 3/4 time and closely resemble the Italian corrente of the time. The sarabandes are mostly in 3/2 time and employ a 1+1/2 rhythm pattern, rather than the standard sarabande rhythm with the accent on the second beat. The gigues are almost invariably fugal, either in compound (6/8) or triple (3/4) meter; different sections may use different motifs, and occasionally the first section's subject is inverted for another section. Bizarrely, a few gigues use dotted rhythms in 4/4 time, and a couple feature exquisite rhapsodic 4/4 endings. Some of the works feature written indications such as \\"f\\" and \\"piano\\" (to notate an echo effect), \\"doucement\\" (\\"gently\\") an \\"avec discr√©tion\\" (expressive rubato). In some of the sources such markings are particularly abundant, and the newly (2004) discovered Berlin Sing-Akademie SA 4450 manuscript adds similar indications to free sections in organ toccatas.Johann Jakob Froberger, Toccaten, Suiten, Lamenti: Die Handschrift SA 4450 der Sing- Akademie zu Berlin, Faksimile und √úbertragung, ed. Peter Wollny (Kassel: B√§renreiter 2004) Some suites feature doubles; in a few, the courante is a derivative of the allemande (although this is rare; more often Froberger unites the two dances by giving them somewhat similar beginnings, but keeps the rest of the material different). Suite no. 6 from Libro Secondo is actually a set of variations subtitled Auff der Mayerin, and one of the more popular Froberger works, although it is clearly an early work and not comparable to the late suites either in technique or in expression. Apart from the suites, Froberger also wrote titled, descriptive pieces for the harpsichord (some of the suites incorporate such works as their first movement). He was one of the earliest composers to produce such programmatic pieces. Nearly all of them are very personal; the style resembles Froberger's allemandes in its irregularity and style bris√© features. Such pieces include the following (in alphabetical order): Allemande faite en passant le Rhin dans une barque en grand p√©ril. Note the 26 numbered passages with explanations of each. * Allemande, faite en passant le Rhin dans une barque en grand p√©ril * Lamentation faite sur la mort tr√®s douloureuse de Sa Majest√© Imp√©riale, Ferdinand le troisi√®me, An. 1657 * Lamentation sur ce que j'ay √©t√© vol√© et se jo√ºe √† la discretion et encore mieux que les soldats m'ont trait√© * Lamento sopra la dolorosa perdita della Real Maest√† di Ferdinando IV R√® de Romani * M√©ditation sur ma mort future * Plainte faite √† Londres pour passer la melancholie * Tombeau fait √† Paris sur la mort de Monsieur Blancrocher These works frequently feature musical metaphors: in the lamentations on the deaths of the lutenist Blancrocher and Ferdinand IV, Froberger represents Blancrocher's fatal fall down a flight of stairs with a descending scale, and Ferdinand's ascent into heaven with an ascending one; in the Ferdinand III lamentation he ends the piece with a single voice repeating an F three times. Froberger would often supply such works with an explanation, sometimes very detailed (see illustration), of the events that led to the composition of the piece. For instance, the Allemande, faite en passat le Rhin contains 26 numbered passages with explanation for each; the Blancrocher tombeau features a written preface in which the circumstances of the lutenist's death are recounted, etc. The structure and style of Froberger's programmatic works, as well as his allemandes, contributed to the development of the unmeasured prelude through the efforts of Louis Couperin. =Polyphonic keyboard works= The rest of Froberger's keyboard works may be performed on any keyboard instrument, including the organ. The toccatas are the only ones to employ free writing to some degree; the majority are strictly polyphonic. In terms of organisation, Froberger's toccatas are reminiscent of those by Michelangelo Rossi, also a student of Frescobaldi; instead of being composed of numerous brief parts, they feature a few tightly woven sections, alternating between strict polyphony and free, improvisational passages. They are usually of moderate length and the harmonic content is not dissimilar to Frescobaldi's, although Froberger's harmony favors softer, more pleasing turnsApel, 553 (not without some notable exceptions, particularly in the two Da sonarsi alla Levatione works), and his toccatas are always more focused on the original tonality, unlike those by either Frescobaldi or Rossi. The fugal sections are present in most toccatas and are quasi-imitative and are not as strict as later 17th century fugues; when a toccata features several fugal inserts, a single motif may be used for all of them, varied rhythmically. Whereas in Frescobaldi's oeuvre the fantasia and the ricercare are markedly different genres (the fantasia being a relatively simple contrapuntal composition that expands, as it progresses, into a flurry of intense, rhythmically complex counterpoint; the ricercare being essentially a very strict contrapuntal piece with easily audible lines and somewhat archaic in terms of structure), Froberger's are practically similar. A typical Froberger ricercare or fantasia uses a single subject (with different rhythmic variations for different sections) throughout the whole piece, and the counterpoint adheres almost flawlessly to the 16th century prima pratica. Any of the standard contrapuntal devices may be used; the main subject is sometimes paired with another theme for a section or two, and there is usually a marked contrast between sections and much variety inside a single piece. Froberger's canzonas and capriccios are similarly conservative in terms of technique, and they too are essentially the same even though Frescobaldi distinguished between the genres. Froberger follows Frescobaldi's example in constructing these pieces as variation sets in several sections (usually three in canzonas and any number ‚Äì as many as six ‚Äì in capriccios). The subjects are always faster, much more lively that those of ricercares and fantasias. A characteristic feature is the economy of themes: the episodes, which are somewhat rare, are almost invariably based on the material from the subject, somewhat like those in JS Bach's work some 60‚Äì70 years later. The counterpoint and harmony are very similar to the ricercares and fantasias; however, occasionally scale degrees other than 1 and 5 are used. =Other works= The only surviving non-keyboard works by Froberger are two motets, Alleluia! Absorpta es mors and Apparuerunt apostolis. They are found in the so-called D√ºben collection, compiled by Gustaf D√ºben, a famous Swedish collector and composer. The manuscript is kept in the Uppsala University library. These motets are quite similar in style: both are scored for a three-voice (STB) choir, two violins and organ (which is given a single melodic line, not polyphony, as was common in Italian motets of the time), and cast in the early 17th century Venetian stile concertante,Yves Ruggeri. Preface to \\"Johann Jakob Froberger: Alleluia, absorpta est mors; Apparuerunt apostolis\\", √âditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre, Monaco, 1990. in marked contrast with Froberger's preference for older techniques in his polyphonic keyboard works. Another connection to contemporary practice is that the small ensemble is almost identical to one used by Heinrich Sch√ºtz in the second volume of Symphoniae sacrae published in 1647. Posthumous influence Although only two of Froberger's works were published during his lifetime, his music was widely spread in Europe in hand-written copies, and he was one of the most famous composers of the era (although he studied in Italy and obviously had friends and former mentors there, no Italian sources of his music were found). Because of his travels and his ability to absorb various national styles and incorporate them into his music, Froberger, along with other cosmopolitan composers such as Johann Kaspar Kerll and Georg Muffat, contributed greatly to the exchange of musical traditions in Europe. Finally, he was among the first major keyboard composers in history and the first to focus equally on both harpsichord/clavichord and organ. Froberger's compositions were known to and studied by, among many others, Johann Pachelbel, Dieterich Buxtehude, Georg Muffat and his son Gottlieb Muffat, Johann Caspar Kerll, Matthias Weckmann, Louis Couperin, Johann Kirnberger, Johann Nikolaus Forkel, Georg B√∂hm, George Handel and Johann Sebastian Bach. Furthermore, copies in Mozart's hand of the Hexachord Fantasia survive, and even Beethoven knew Froberger's work through Albrechtsberger's teachings. The profound influence on Louis Couperin made Froberger partially responsible for the change Couperin brought into the French organ tradition (as well as for the development of the unmeasured prelude, which Couperin cultivated). Although the polyphonic pieces were highly esteemed in the 17th and 18th centuries, today Froberger is chiefly remembered for his contribution to the development of the keyboard suite. Indeed, he established the form almost single-handedly and, through innovative and imaginative treatment of standard dance forms of the time, paved the way for Johann Sebastian Bach's elaborate contributions to the genre (not to mention almost every major composer in Europe, since the vast majority composed suites and were influenced by the \\"French style\\" exemplified by Froberger).

Historically, it was the center of the Kilwa Sultanate, a medieval sultanate whose authority at its height in the 13th-15th centuries stretched the entire length of the Swahili Coast. Kilwa Kisiwani has been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site along with the nearby stonetown Songo Mnara. History and archaeology Kilwa Kisiwani is an archaeological city-state site located along the Swahili Coast on the Kilwa archipelago. It was occupied from at least the 8th century CE and became one of the most powerful settlements along the coast. The seasonal wind reversals would affect trade circulations. Trade connections with the Arabian Peninsula as well as India and China influenced the growth and development of Kilwa, and, though there are Islamic words and customs that have been adapted to the culture, the origins are African. Many of the Swahili settlements showed complex layouts that reflected social relations between groups, however at Kilwa, there are many questions still left unanswered about the town layout. The cemeteries were located on the edge of the town, which was common for the region, and large, open spaces were likely used for social gatherings. An important city for trade, around the 13th century there were increased fortifications and a greater flow of goods. For these to take place, there would need to be a form of political administration overseeing the city, controlling the movement of goods. Much of the trade networks was with the Arabian peninsula. Kilwa Kisiwani reached its highest point in wealth and commerce between 13th and 15th centuries CE. Evidence of growth in wealth can be seen with the appearance of stone buildings around the 13th century CE, before which all of the buildings were wattle-and-daub. The socio-economic status of the individuals residing there could be clearly seen in the type of structure they were living in. Among Kilwa's exports were spices, tortoiseshell, coconut oil, ivory, and aromatic gums, as well as gold. At around this time, Kilwa had seized control over the trade of gold at Sofala. The wealthy also possessed more commercial goods than the individuals who were of the lower class did. Luxury cloths and foreign ceramics were among a few of the items they would have owned, though some items, such as luxury clothes, do not preserve in the archaeological record. For approximately 500 years, Kilwa was minting coins. This lasted from about 1100-1600 CE and the coins have been found across the region, including Great Zimbabwe. Marine resources were abundant and utilized for food. Food sources would also come from the surrounding land. But because of the huge impact the sea, with all of the resources and trade opportunities, had on Kilwa, the archaeological investigation of the harbors and ports is considered to be quite important. The soil at Kilwa that was found over the limestone was of poor quality, so the land food sources came from the areas of higher ground. However, the soil in the Kilwa region would have been suitable for growing cotton, which could be used in sail manufacturing. 12th century spindle whorls have been found, indicating that cotton was used and processed in this area. =Ceramics= At first, most of the focus was placed on the archaeology of Kilwa's ports and harbors, however, more and more emphasis is being placed on Kilwa's hinterlands. Ceramic artifacts are plentiful at the site and can be divided into two groups: regional and coastal. All of the ceramics with regional distribution were locally produced, but the area of distribution is limited. These unglazed ceramics were referred to as Kitchen Wares, though their uses were not necessarily just as cooking vessels. All of the varieties of locally produced pottery found in the region were also uncovered at the site of Kilwa itself. While the Kitchen Wares could be seen throughout the region, there were ceramics that were mostly seen within Kilwa itself. These included modeled forms and red-burnished wares. The distribution pattern of the red- burnished wares was coastal. Other ceramic types that were seemingly restricted to town were the imported ceramic vessels from the Arabian peninsula and China. Imported ceramic materials are not found in rural areas. They were used as a sign of social status by the elite. They were kept in wall niches made just for the purpose of displaying them. These imported ceramics played important symbolic roles along the Swahili Coast. The symbolism attached to the imported ceramics was so strong that it carried on to modern Swahili culture. The lack of imported goods in the hinterlands indicates that, while Kilwa was undergoing a process of urbanization, the local communities did not undergo a dramatic transformation. =Preservation= In 2004, Kilwa Kisiwani was inscribed on UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger. There is a serious rapid deterioration of the archaeological and monumental heritage of these two islands due to various agents like erosion and vegetation. The eastern section of the Palace of Husuni Kubwa, for example, is progressively disappearing. The damage to the soil caused by rainwater wash is accentuating the risks of the collapse of the remaining structures on the edge of the cliff. The vegetation that proliferates on the cliff has limited the progression of the rain-wash effect but causes the break-up of the masonry structures. The World Monuments Fund included Kilwa on its 2008 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites, and since 2008 has been supporting conservation work on various buildings. Notable features =Great Mosque= The Great Mosque of Kilwa is a congregational mosque on the island of Kilwa Kisiwani, in Tanzania. It was likely founded in the tenth century, but the two major stages of construction date to the 12th or twelfth and thirteenth century, respectively. It is one of the earliest surviving mosques on the Swahili Coast. The smaller northern prayer hall dates to the first phase of construction. It contained a total of 16 bays supported by nine pillars, which were originally carved from coral but later replaced by timber. The structure was entirely roofed, and was perhaps one of the first mosques in the area to have been built without a courtyard. In the early fourteenth century, Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman, who also built the nearby Palace of Husuni Kubwa, added a southern extension which included a great dome. This dome was described by Ibn Battuta after he visited Kilwa in 1331. You can view a 3D model of the Great Mosque here =Palace of Husuni Kubwa= The fort (Gereza) on the banks of Kilwa Kisiwani. View a 3D model here. Husuni Kubwa (the \\"Great Fort\\"), situated outside the town, was an early 14th-century sultan's palace and emporium. Other defining features include causeways and platforms at the entrance of the Harbour made from blocks of reef and coral nearly a meter high. These act as breakwaters, allowing mangroves to grow which is one of the ways the breakwater can be spotted from a distance. Some parts of the causeway are made from the bedrock, but usually the bedrock was used as a base. Coral stone was used to build up the causeways with sand and lime being used to cement the cobbles together. Some of the stones were left loose. The Palace of Husuni Kubwa is a ruined structure on the island of Kilwa Kisiwani, in Tanzania. The majority of the palace was erected in the 14th century by Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman, who also built an extension to the nearby Great Mosque of Kilwa, although portions may date back to the 13th century. The palace was inhabited only for a brief period of time, and abandoned before its completion. The structure was built out of coral stone on a high bluff overlooking the Indian Ocean. It consists of three major elements: a south court, used primarily for commerce; a residential complex including over one hundred individual rooms; and a wide stairway leading down to a mosque on the beach. Other notable features include a pavilion, which likely served as a reception hall, and an octagonal swimming pool. All of Husuni Kubwa spans across approximately two acres. The coral rag was set in limestone mortar and cut stone was used for decorative pieces, door jams, and vaults. The rooms were about 3 meters tall. The roof was made from cut limestone blocks laid across cut timbers and the floors were white plaster. The main entrance to Husuni Kubwa is from the shore. Most of the imported glazed pottery recovered at the site was Chinese celadon, though there were a few Ying Ch'ing stoneware sherds present, and a Yuan dynasty flask dated to about 1300 CE. Neither the Kilwa Chronicle nor any other Portuguese accounts describe a building comparable to Husuni Kubwa. =Husuni Ndogo= Husuni Ndogo (\\"Little Fort\\") is built from coral rubble and limestone mortar. The rectangular enclosure wall surrounds the complex and at each corner stands a tower. The foundations extend two meters below ground level. It appears to have been built as a fort, but the exact purposes and uses are somewhat unknown. There is some evidence that it, for at least a time, was used as a mosque. Architecturally, it appears to be different from other buildings along the coast, resembling buildings constructed under the Caliphs of the Umayyad at around 661-750 CE. However, whether or not the structure is related or even dates to the Arabic buildings remains uncertain, though it seems unlikely. Outside influence A 1572 depiction of the city of Kilwa from Georg Braun and Frans Hogenberg's atlas Civitates orbis terrarum. German East Africa colony stamp used in 1898. A document written around 1200 CE called al-Maqama al Kilwiyya, discovered in Oman, gives details of a mission to reconvert Kilwa to Ibadism, as it had recently been affected by the Ghurabiyya Shia doctrine from southern Iraq. According to local oral tradition, in the 11th century the island of Kilwa Kisiwani was sold to Ali bin Hasan, son of the \\"King\\" of Shiraz, in Persia. Another tradition relates that his mother was Somali. Ali bin Al-Hasan is credited with founding the island city and with marrying the daughter of the local king. Though he was credited with the founding, he had arrived at an already inhabited area. He did, however, come to power and is credited with fortifying the city and increasing trade. Tradition also relates that it was the child of this union who founded the Kilwa Sultanate. Archaeological and documentary research has revealed that over the next few centuries, Kilwa grew to be a substantial city and the leading commercial entrep√¥t on the southern half of the Swahili Coast (roughly from the present Tanzanian-Kenya border southward to the mouth of the Zambezi River), trading extensively with states of the Southeast African hinterland as far as Zimbabwe. Trade was mainly in gold, iron, ivory and other animal products of the interior for beads, textiles, jewelry, porcelain and spices from Asia. By the 12th century, under the rule of the Abu'-Mawahib dynasty, Kilwa had become the most powerful city on the Swahili Coast. At the zenith of its power in the 15th century, the Kilwa Sultanate claimed authority over the city-states of Malindi, Mvita (Mombasa), Pemba Island, Zanzibar, Mafia Island, Comoro, Sofala and the trading posts across the channel on Madagascar. Ibn Battuta recorded his visit to the city around 1331, and commented favorably on the generosity, humility, and religion of its ruler, Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman. Ibn Battuta also describes how the sultan would go into the interior and raid the people taking slaves and other forms of wealth. He was also particularly impressed by the planning of the city and believed that it was the reason for Kilwa's success along the coast. From this period date the construction of the Palace of Husuni Kubwa and a significant extension to the Great Mosque of Kilwa, which was made of coral stones‚Äîthe largest mosque of its kind. Kilwa was an important and also wealthy city for the trade of gold, because of this some of the people who lived in Kilwa had a higher standard of living, but many others were also poor. The wealthy enjoyed indoor plumbing in their stone homes and the poor lived in mud huts with thatched roofs.The Travels of Ibn Battuta In the early 16th century, Vasco da Gama extorted tribute from the wealthy Islamic state. In 1505 another Portuguese force commanded by D. Francisco de Almeida took control of the island after besieging it. It remained in Portuguese hands until 1512, when an Arab mercenary captured Kilwa after the Portuguese abandoned their outpost. The city regained some of its earlier prosperity, but in 1784 was conquered by the Omani rulers of Zanzibar. After the Omani conquest, the French built and manned a fort at the northern tip of the island, but the city itself was abandoned in the 1840s. It was later part of the colony of German East Africa from 1886 to 1918.  Documentation with 3D Laser Scanners  Between 2005 and 2009, the Zamani Project documented some of the Swahili ruins on Kilwa Kisiwani with terrestrial 3D laser scanning . The structures documented include: the Gereza (prison); the Great Mosque; the Husuni Kubwa; the Makutani Building and the Malindi Mosque. Some of the 3D models, a panorama tour, elevations, sections and plans are available on www.zamaniproject.org. Tourism The town is located within the Kilwa District of the Lindi Region. It is possible to visit the island of Kilwa Kisiwani and most people base themselves in Kilwa Masoko. The town Kilwa Masoko can be reached by bus from Dar es Salaam (leaving Mbagala bus stop), and is served by Coastal Aviation. There are numerous basic guesthouses and a handful of tourist hotels, mostly spread along Jimbiza beach and the beautiful and highly regarded Masoko Pwani. A permit is needed to visit the ruins of Kisiwani itself, and can be easily obtained from the local government building on the main road in Kilwa Masoko. Once the permit has been obtained it is easy to arrange dhow transport over the narrow channel to Kisiwani. Notes Further reading *. Volume 1: History and archaeology; Volume 2: The finds.

Biography Hasso was born in the Kungsholmen parish of Stockholm, Sweden in 1915.1915 Birth Record for Kungsholms Parish and its Record of baptisms, p. 91 [1915-√•rs F√∂delsebok f√∂r Kungsholms f√∂rsamling och dess Dopbok, sid. 91] Her father and grandfather died when she was four, and her mother, grandmother, two siblings, and she shared a single room. Her mother, a former aspiring actress herself, worked as a waffle cook. Her acting career began by accident. When a young actress fell ill, her mother was asked if she knew of any little girl who could act. Signe Hasso later recalled, \\"I was 12 then and didn't want to go and neither did my sister, so my mother flipped a coin. I lost.\\" Her audition for a Moli√®re play was successful, and she started earning money as an actress. She performed in Royal Dramatic Theatre productions, beginning in 1927 at the age of 12, and enrolled as the youngest acting student in its history at the age of 16. She performed on stage and in film in Sweden. In 1933, she made her first film, Tystnadens hus, with German film director/cameraman Harry Hasso, whom she married the same year. They had a son by the time she was 19. They divorced in 1941. In 1940, she moved to the United States, where she signed a contract with RKO Pictures, who promoted her as \\"the next Garbo\\". With few RKO roles forthcoming, she turned to the stage to make a living. According to the Internet Broadway Database, she appeared in five Broadway productions, beginning with Golden Wings (1941). In the mid-1940s, she signed with Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer. Her first role of note was in Heaven Can Wait (1943). During the 1940s, she appeared in The Seventh Cross (1944), Johnny Angel (1945), The House on 92nd Street (1945), A Scandal in Paris (1946), and A Double Life (1947). Her favorite role was as the ex-wife of an actor driven mad, played by Ronald Colman, in A Double Life. By the 1950s, her Hollywood career had stalled. In 1957, her son and only child was killed in a car accident. From then on, she divided her time between making films in Sweden and acting on stage in New York City until she returned to Hollywood in the 1960s. She also acted on television, making guest appearances in several popular TV series, including Route 66, Bonanza, The Outer Limits, The Green Hornet, Cannon, Starsky and Hutch, The Streets of San Francisco, Quincy, M.E., Magnum, P.I., Trapper John, M.D., and Hart to Hart. In her later years, Hasso worked as a songwriter and writer and translated Swedish folk songs into English. Her debut novel, Momo (1977), depicts her childhood in interwar Stockholm. Hasso's second album, Where the Sun Meets the Moon (1979), consists of her own versions of Swedish folk tunes. In a 1995 interview, she stated she wanted to be remembered for her writing, not her acting. She continued to act until late in her life, her last film being One Hell of a Guy (2000). Death She died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California in 2002, aged 86, of pneumonia and cancer. Hasso adhered to Lutheranism.Morning News, January 10, 1948, Who Was Who in America (Vol. 2) Awards In 1935, she received the Theatre League's De Wahl-stipendium and in 1939 the first Nordic nordiska G√∂sta Ekmanpriset. In 1972, King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden named her Member 1st Class of the Royal Order of Vasa. In 1989, the Vasa Order of America named her Swedish-American of the Year. Hasso has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to motion pictures, at 7080 Hollywood Boulevard.

Biography He is said to have been clerk to an attorney, and was certainly self-educated. In 1744, he succeeded Samuel Johnson as compiler of the parliamentary debates for the Gentleman's Magazine, and from 1741 to 1749 he contributed poems signed Greville, or H Greville, to that journal. In company with Johnson and others he started a periodical called The Adventurer, which ran to 140 issues, of which 70 were from the pen of Hawkesworth himself. Portrait of Hawkesworth On account of what was regarded as his powerful defence of morality and religion, Hawkesworth was rewarded by the archbishop of Canterbury with the degree of LL.D, In 1754‚Äì1755 he published an edition (12 vols) of Swift's works, with a life prefixed which Johnson praised in his Lives of the Poets. A larger edition (27 vols) appeared in 1766‚Äì1779. He adapted Dryden's Amphitryon for the Drury Lane stage in 1756, and Southerne's Oronooko in 1759. He wrote the libretto of an oratorio Zimri in 1760, and the next year Edgar and Emmeline: a Fairy Tale was produced at Drury Lane. His Almoran and Hamet (1761) was first drafted as a play , and a tragedy based on it by S J Pratt, The Fair Circassian (1781), met with some success. He was commissioned by the Admiralty to edit Captain James Cook's papers relative to his first voyage. For this work, An Account of the Voyages undertaken ... for making discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere and performed by Commodore Byrone John Byron, Captain Wallis, Captain Carteret and Captain Cook (from 1702 to 1771) drawn up from the Journals ... (3 vols, 1773) Hawkesworth is said to have received from the publishers the sum of ¬£6000. His descriptions of the manners and customs of the South Seas were, however, regarded by many critics as inexact and hurtful to the interests of morality, and the severity of their strictures is said to have hastened his death. He was buried in the parish church at Bromley, Kent, where he and his wife had kept a school. Hawkesworth was a close imitator of Johnson both in style and thought, and was at one time on very friendly terms with him. It is said that he presumed on his success, and lost Johnson's friendship as early as 1756.

It offers a variety of card and board games like First Class Solitaire and Monopoly to puzzle, sports and word games like Scrabble. It is owned by Electronic Arts and is based in Redwood Shores, California. The website is free due to advertising sponsorships but during a game, it produces commercials that can last up to 20 seconds. Players are strongly encouraged to sign up for Club Pogo, a subscription service. The enticement to do so is the offer of premium benefits and the omission of the advertisements that would otherwise interrupt the games. Games are played in a browser with the Java-plugin, Flash and more recently HTML5. Flash games are being slowly discontinued through 2020. Games load in a \\"room\\" allowing other players to join and chat. Players can win jackpot prizes (discontinued in 2019) and tokens from playing the games on Pogo.com. Tokens are no longer used in sweepstakes drawings as of December 2010 (discontinued in 2019). Players can place bets of tokens on some games, such as Texas hold 'em poker and High Stakes poker. Cash (in the form of pre-paid credit cards) and merchandise prizes are available to U.S. and Canadian residents, excluding Quebec. Pogo also offers downloadable games, often \\"deluxe\\" or \\"to go\\" versions of already- released games, which can be bought and played while offline. Some of these downloadable games include chat and tokens, similar to the original games. Since 2006, Pogo.com has consistently been a top-10 Internet site for U.S. visitors when measured by time spent online.  Corporate history  = Creation = Optigon Interactive launched a beta of the \\"Total Entertainment Network\\" in 1994. The T.E. Network, Inc, which became Pogo.com was created in 1995 from the merger of two predecessor companies, Optigon Interactive (founded by Daniel Goldman and Janice Linden-Reed) and Outland (founded by Dave King, Bill Lipa, and Alex Beltramo), in conjunction with investment from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers led by partner Vinod Khosla. The original grand vision of the company was to become a hip, young version of CompuServe - a dial-up service for the MTV generation. Optigon had already launched a beta dial-in service along these lines with some simple games but also with other content. Much of the early hiring was therefore focused on editorial staff for content such as comics and music designed to appeal to that demographic and this was reflected in the grandiose name \\"Total Entertainment Network.\\" The first major strategic change to come from the merger was not the decision to focus on games exclusively or even low latency games but rather the decision to abandon the dial-in model which was so successful for AOL and instead to create an internet-based service available to anyone with a TCP/IP connection. This was a dramatic step to take given that Windows95 was just about to be introduced which would have built-in support for IP as opposed to earlier Microsoft operating systems where you had to get and install your own add-on IP stack and also given that the vast majority of \\"internet\\" access at the time was still via AOL. = Total Entertainment Network 1995‚Äì1998 = T.E. Network's first major service was a newly designed version of the Total Entertainment Network (TEN), which it launched in 1996. While the brand remained the same, the feature set was a subset of Optigon's version of TEN, with the addition of features related to low latency game play. T.E. Network entered additional partnerships with major game developers, and offered gamers a way to play their favorite games with other people across the country. TEN was an immediate success among the hardcore gaming community. The service's initial flagship game was Duke Nukem, and SSI's DarkSun RPG found a solid following on TEN. Ultimately the most popular title would be NASCAR Racing Online, with peak simultaneous usage of about 1700 people. After the success of Blizzard's free Battle.net service for Diablo and their claim that offering online play as a feature of the game boosted retail sales by 10%, PC game publishers started following Blizzard's lead and offering free online game play and/or building matchmaking functions directly into the game (e.g. Quake II). This undermined the subscription business model of TEN and its strategy to be the exclusive place to play popular PC games online. In addition, TEN's revenue model suffered from the fact that its largest direct competitor Mplayer.com decided to abandon paid subscriptions and moved to a purely ad- supported free play model. With the failure of TEN to reach a critical mass of players, the company needed a new business model and offering to survive. = Pogo.com 1998‚Äìpresent = The company found success with its second major service: a web offering that would become pogo.com. As Internet advertising was starting to gain traction, the company decided to focus on easy-to-access and easy-to-play browser-based games that would appeal to a broad audience and attract enough unique users to drive an advertising-based business model. The corporate strategy shifted from acquiring exclusive game content to securing exclusive distribution relationship, while the client platform changed from a Windows executable to a browser-based java applet. Excite was their first partner. T.E. Network acquired Michael Riccio's WebDeck service, which offered Java-based versions of Euchre, Spades, and Hearts that ran in the popular web browsers circa 1998, to accelerate this transition. In July 1998, the company launched this web-based offering as \\"Excite Games by TEN\\" and built a large audience by offering co-branded browser-based games to many of the portals available in 1998. The Pogo.com brand was launched on September 1, 1999, and the company renamed itself to Pogo.com. Pogo grew quickly, eventually outpacing its competition to become the \\"stickiest game site on the Internet.\\" according to a company press release. Although the site was popular by late 2000, the Dot-Com bubble was bursting for most startup companies, and cash was very tight. Pogo.com entered into a deal to be purchased by then popular web portal Excite@Home Network, also a Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers/Vinod Khosla investment. However Excite was having problems of its own and heading for bankruptcy. When AT&T; took control of the Excite@Home board, they aborted the acquisition. = The Electronic Arts acquisition = In March 2001, a Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers investment from the early 1980s, Electronic Arts (EA) purchased Pogo.com for approximately $40 million. Some of their distributions partners included Excite, WebCrawler, Netscape's Netcenter, Prodigy, Geocities, CNET, Snap.com, Road Runner, Go, @Home Network, AltaVista, Sony Station, XOOM, and iVillage. Pogo.com's games and community were considered by some to be very engaging, and Pogo.com became the stickiest site among the top-100 websites.  Club Pogo  Launched in 2003, Club Pogo is Pogo.com's premium subscription-based service. Perks to subscribers include exclusive members-only rooms (discontinued), no ad interruptions, graphic emoticons (smileys) (discontinued), private chat (discontinued), \\"Pogo Minis\\" (avatars) (which later became available to free Pogo members), double jackpot spins (discontinued), and access to full content in-game. Exclusive Club Pogo games include Jungle Gin, Canasta, Bookworm, Pogo Addiction Solitaire, Tri- Peaks Solitaire and Crazy Cakes 2. Club Pogo members can also earn Badges by completing challenges in various games. There are several types of badges, including weekly badges, personal challenges and Premium badges (that can be purchased for an additional cost). In addition to this, subscribers also get access to site wide events and the new Seasons that grant you Pogis (points) for the specific challenges you complete. Most of the new games Pogo features require players to buy (with gems purchased with the player's money) powerups in order to progress faster. = Club Pogo UK = On September 25, 2007, Pogo launched Club Pogo UK. Pogo members in the UK are now able to purchase Pogo Gems, Mix-n-Match badges and Premium Mini items and win other prizes in British currency (¬£), whereas previously they were unobtainable, though this fact was never made clear by Pogo games until now. UK players are still unable to gain access to some parts of Pogo, such as Scrabble for example. Members of Club Pogo in the UK have become part of the Founders Club on the launch date and were able to claim a new Founders Club badge as well as a surprise gift. Two days after the launch on September 27, several new Pogo Mini items were released with a British theme. On September 25, 2008, on the first anniversary of club Pogo UK, the winning entry in a competition to design a Mini item was released: The very 'English Seaside' attire of 'Rolled-up Trousers' and 'Knotted Hanky'. P.O.G.O UK was closed down on the 21st of May 2013.  Jackpot Prizes  As of February 8, 2011 Pogo.com switched to a new prize format with the removal of all in game jackpots. Pogo now awards individual prizes that vary based on cash amount or prize items such as video games, coffee mugs, etc. Jackpot prizes were discontinued in 2019.  Other Platforms  = Facebook = The Pogo Games Facebook application beta was released in March 2010. The application features 20+ Pogo titles that can be played within Facebook and includes features such as challenges, leaderboards and achievements. Like Pogo.com, the Facebook App is free to play with advertisements. Club Pogo members play without advertisements and receive additional bonus and features. = iPhone/iPod Touch = On December 7, 2010 Pogo launched the Pogo Games application for iPhone and iPod touch. The app reached number one in free games immediately following its release. The Pogo Games app contains mobile versions of five Pogo games at launch: Poppit!, Word Whomp, Sweet Tooth 2, Mahjong Safari and Turbo 21. A sixth game, Phlinx was added with the version 1.1 update in February 2011. World Class Solitaire was added in May 2011 with a UI refresh on all the games. The Application is free to play with advertisements. Club Pogo members can sign in and play without ads, and an ads-free version of the application can be unlocked with a purchase of $20.99. = iPad = Pogo released CLUE: Secrets and Spies, a hidden object game for the iPad in November 2010. = Android = Pogo Games App has been released for Android devices with some differences. Mahjong Safari and Phlinx are not available for play, while jackpot spins have been disabled. World Class Solitaire can only be played when logged into a Club Pogo account. There is also no one-time fee to remove ads, you either sign-in as a Club Pogo member (Internet connection required) or play free with ads.

He was sometimes called the fastest pitcher in baseball history and had a fastball that probably exceeded . Some experts believed it went as fast as , others that his pitches traveled at less than that speed. As no radar gun or other device was available at games to measure the speed of his pitches precisely, the actual top speed of his pitches remains unknown. Regardless of its actual speed, his fastball earned him the nickname \\"White Lightning\\". Such was his reputation that despite never reaching the major leagues, and finishing his minor league years in class-B ball, the 1966 Sporting News item about the end of his career was headlined \\"Living Legend Released.\\" Dalkowski was also famous for his unpredictable performance and inability to control his pitches. His alcoholism and violent behavior off the field caused him problems during his career and after his retirement. After he retired from baseball, he spent many years as an alcoholic, making a meager living as a manual laborer. He recovered in the 1990s, but his alcoholism left him with dementia and he had difficulty remembering his life after the mid-1960s. Screenwriter and film director Ron Shelton played in the Baltimore Orioles minor league organization soon after Dalkowski. His 1988 film Bull Durham features a character named \\"Nuke\\" LaLoosh (played by Tim Robbins) who is based loosely on the tales Shelton was told about Dalkowski. Brendan Fraser's character in the film The Scout is loosely based on him. In 1970, Sports Illustrated's Pat Jordan wrote, \\"Inevitably, the stories outgrew the man, until it was no longer possible to distinguish fact from fiction. But, no matter how embellished, one fact always remained: Dalkowski struck out more batters and walked more batters per nine-inning game than any professional pitcher in baseball history.\\" Baseball career Dalkowski was born in New Britain, Connecticut, the son of Adele Zaleski, who worked in a ball bearing factory, and Stephen Dalkowski, a tool and die maker.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/obituaries/steve-dalkowski-dead.html He began playing baseball in high school, and also played football as a quarterback for New Britain High School. During his time with the football team, they won the division championship twice, in 1955 and 1956. However, he excelled the most in baseball, and still holds a Connecticut state record for striking out 24 batters in a single game. After graduating from high school in 1957, Dalkowski signed with the Baltimore Orioles for a $4,000 signing bonus, and initially played for their class-D minor league affiliate in Kingsport, Tennessee. He spent his entire career in the minor leagues, playing in nine different leagues during his nine-year career. His only appearance at the Orioles' Memorial Stadium was during an exhibition game in 1959, when he struck out the opposing side. Dalkowski's claim to fame was the high velocity of his fastball. Accurate measurements at the time were difficult to make, but the consensus is that Dalkowski regularly threw well above . Dalkowski's raw speed was aided by his highly flexible left (pitching) arm, and by his unusual \\"buggy-whip\\" pitching motion, which ended in a cross-body arm swing. \\"I hit my left elbow on my right knee so often, they finally made me a pad to wear\\", recalled Dalkowski. Dalkowski often had extreme difficulty controlling his pitches. He often walked more batters than he struck out, and many times his pitches would go wild ‚Äî sometimes so wild that they ended up in the stands. Batters found the combination of extreme velocity and lack of control intimidating. Oriole Paul Blair stated that \\"He threw the hardest I ever saw. He was the wildest I ever saw\\". During a typical season in 1960, while pitching in the California League, Dalkowski struck out 262 batters and walked 262 in 170 innings. Dalkowski for 1960 thus figures at both 13.81 K/9IP and 13.81 BB/9IP (see lifetime statistics below). In comparison, Randy Johnson currently holds the major league record for strikeouts per nine innings in a season with 13.41. In separate games, Dalkowski struck out 21 batters, and walked 21 batters. Because a pitcher is generally considered wild if he averages four walks per nine innings, a pitcher of average repertoire who consistently walked as many as nine men per nine innings would not normally be considered a prospect. But such was the allure of Dalkowski's explosive arm that the Orioles gave him chance after chance to harness his \\"stuff\\", knowing that if he ever managed to control it, he would be a great weapon. Pitching for the Kingsport (Tennessee) Orioles on August 31, 1957 in Bluefield, West Virginia, Dalkowski struck out 24 Bluefield hitters in a single minor league game, yet issued 18 walks, and threw six wild pitches.Kingsport Times News, Sept 1, 1957, page 9 Dalkowski pitched a total of 62 innings in 1957, struck out 121 (averaging 18 strikeouts per game), but won only once because he walked 129 and threw 39 wild pitches. Moving to the Northern League in 1958‚Äì59, he threw a one-hitter but lost 9‚Äì8 on the strength of 17 walks. In 1957‚Äì58, Dalkowski either struck out or walked almost three out of every four batters he faced. Earl Weaver managed Dalkowski with the Aberdeen Pheasants in 1959 and for several years with the Elmira Pioneers. During the 1960s under Earl Weaver, then the manager for the Orioles' double-A affiliate in Elmira, New York, Dalkowski's game began to show improvement. Weaver had given all of the players an IQ test and discovered that Dalkowski had a lower than normal IQ. Weaver believed that Dalkowski had experienced such difficulty keeping his game under control because he did not have the mental capacity. Weaver kept things simple for Dalkowski, telling him to only throw the fastball and a slider, and to just aim the fastball down the middle of the plate. This allowed Dalkowski to concentrate on just throwing the ball for strikes. Weaver knew that Dalkowski's fastball was practically unhittable no matter where it was in the strike zone, and if Dalkowski missed his target, he might end up throwing it on the corners for a strike anyway. Under Weaver's stewardship, Dalkowski had his best season in 1962, posting personal bests in complete games and earned run average (ERA), and walking less than a batter an inning for the first time in his career. In an extra-inning game, Dalkowski recorded 27 strikeouts (while walking 16 and throwing 283 pitches). Dalkowski was invited to major league spring training in 1963, and the Orioles expected to call him up to the majors. On March 23, Dalkowski was used as a relief pitcher during a game against the New York Yankees. Most sources say that while throwing a slider to Phil Linz, he felt something pop in his left elbow, which turned out to be a severe muscle strain. Some uncertainty over the cause of his injury exists, however, with other sources contending that he damaged his elbow while throwing to first after fielding a bunt from Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton. Either way, his arm never fully recovered. When he returned in 1964, Dalkowski's fastball had dropped to , and midway through the season he was released by the Orioles. He played for two more seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Los Angeles Angels organizations before returning briefly to the Orioles farm system but was unable to regain his form before retiring in 1966. Dalkowski had a lifetime win-loss record of 46‚Äì80 and an ERA of 5.57 in nine minor league seasons, striking out 1,396 and walking 1,354 in 995 innings. =Pitching speed= Dalkowski's wildness frightened even the bravest of hitters. Ted Williams faced Dalkowski once in a spring training game. \\"Fastest ever\\", said Williams. \\"I never want to face him again.\\" Longtime umpire Doug Harvey also cited Dalkowski as the fastest pitcher he had seen: \\"Nobody could bring it like he could.\\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Jy4DAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA40&lpg;=PA40&dq;=dalkowski+etchebarren&source;=bl&ots;=sl6qHyVDAs&sig;=UH7sCvqRfxi3pIMrmC7tQ54rS-k&hl;=en&ei;=ikCETZe3DtKN0QHwwZzPCA&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=1&sqi;=2&ved;=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;=dalkowski%20etchebarren&f;=false Estimates of Dalkowski's top pitching speed abound. Cal Ripken Sr. guessed that he threw up to . Most observers agree that he routinely threw well over , and sometimes reached . Radar guns, which were used for many years in professional baseball, did not exist when Dalkowski was playing, so the only evidence supporting this level of velocity is anecdotal. It is certain that with his high speed and penchant for throwing wild pitches, he would have been an intimidating opponent for any batter who faced him. Andy Etchebarren, a catcher for Dalkowski at Elmira, described his fastball as \\"light\\" and fairly easy to catch. According to Etchebarren his wilder pitches usually went high, sometimes low; \\"Dalkowski would throw a fastball that looked like it was coming in at knee level, only to see it sail past the batter's eyes\\". Dalkowski's greatest legacy may be the number of anecdotes (some more believable than others) surrounding his pitching ability. He was said to have thrown a pitch that tore off part of a batter's ear. Some observers believed that this incident made Dalkowski even more nervous and contributed further to his wildness. Another story says that in 1960 at Stockton, California, he threw a pitch that broke umpire Doug Harvey's mask in three places, knocking him back and sending him to a hospital for three days with a concussion. Dalkowski once won a $5 bet with teammate Herm Starrette who said that he could not throw a baseball through a wall. Dalkowski warmed up and then moved away from the wooden outfield fence. His first pitch went right through the boards. On another bet, Dalkowski threw a ball over a fence away. The only recorded evidence of his pitching speed stems from 1958, when Dalkowski was sent by the Orioles to Aberdeen Proving Ground, a military installation. Here, using a radar machine, he was clocked at , a fast but not outstanding speed for a professional pitcher. However, several factors worked against Dalkowski: he had pitched a game the day before, he was throwing from a flat surface instead of from a pitcher's mound, and he had to throw pitches for 40 minutes at a small target before the machine could capture an accurate measurement. Further, the device measured speed from a few feet away from the plate, instead of 10 feet from release as in modern times. This cost Dalkowski approximately , not even considering the other factors. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the current record holder for fastest pitch is Nolan Ryan, with a pitch clocked at in 1974, though the record has not been updated in many years and several pitchers have recorded faster pitches since then. That seems to be because Ryan's speed was recorded from the plate, unlike 10 feet from release as today, costing him up to .https://web.archive.org/web/20151001161925/http://www.efastball.com/baseball/stats/fastest- pitch-speed-in-major-leagues/ Earl Weaver, who had years of exposure to both pitchers, said, \\"[Dalkowski] threw a lot faster than Ryan.\\" The hardest thrower in baseball currently is recognized as Aroldis Chapman, who has been clocked with the fastest pitch on record at . Scientists contend that the theoretical maximum speed that a pitcher can throw is slightly above . Beyond that the pitcher would cause himself a serious injury. Life after baseball In 1965, Dalkowski married schoolteacher Linda Moore in Bakersfield, but they divorced two years later. Unable to find any gainful employment, he became a migrant worker. Dalkowski experienced problems with alcohol abuse. He drank heavily as a player and his drinking escalated after the end of his career. He received help from the Association of Professional Ball Players of America (APBPA) periodically from 1974 to 1992 and went through rehabilitation. He was able to find a job and stay sober for several months but soon went back to drinking. The APBPA stopped providing financial assistance to him because he was using the funds to purchase alcohol. Poor health in the 1980s prevented Dalkowski from working altogether, and by the end of the decade he was living in a small apartment in California, penniless and suffering from alcohol- induced dementia. At some point during this time, Dalkowski married a motel clerk named Virginia, who moved him to Oklahoma City in 1993. She died of a brain aneurysm in 1994. Dalkowski had lived at a long-term care facility in New Britain for several years. In a 2003 interview, Dalkowski said that he was unable to remember life events that occurred from 1964 to 1994. For his contributions to baseball lore, Dalkowski was inducted into the Shrine of the Eternals on July 19, 2009. Sports Illustrated's 1970 profile of Dalkowski concluded, \\"His failure was not one of deficiency, but rather of excess. He was too fast. His ball moved too much. His talent was too superhuman... It mattered only that once, just once, Steve Dalkowski threw a fastball so hard that Ted Williams never even saw it. No one else could claim that.\\" Death With complications from dementia, Steve Dalkowski died in New Britain, Connecticut on April 19, 2020 from COVID-19, one of the many nursing home victims that succumbed to the coronavirus pandemic of 2020.

It is often abbreviated as CP and houses the headquarters of several noted Indian firms and is a major shopping, nightlife and tourist destination in New Delhi. It was designed by Robert Tor Russell. As of July 2018, Connaught Place was the ninth most expensive office location in the world with an annual rent of US$153 per sq ft. The main commercial area of the new city, New Delhi, occupies a place of pride in the city and are counted among the top heritage structures in New Delhi. It was developed as a showpiece of Lutyens' Delhi with a prominent Central Business District (Delhi). Named after Prince Arthur, 1st Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, construction work began in 1929 and was completed in 1933. The area today falls under the jurisdiction of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and is therefore allotted a high priority in term of funds for maintenance and upkeep. New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA) is the association of establishments (like retails stores, restaurants, cinema halls, offices) in Connaught Place. NDTA also plays a major role in liaising with government bodies like NDMC in order to represent the commercial interests and maintenance issues of Connaught Place establishments. A metro railway station built under it is named Rajiv Chowk (after Rajiv Gandhi). History Prior to the construction of Connaught Place, the area was a ridge, covered with kikar trees and populated with jackals and wild pigs. Residents of the Kashmere Gate, Civil Lines area visited during the weekends for partridge hunting. The Hanuman Temple attracted many visitors from the old walled city, who came only on Tuesdays and Saturdays and before sunset, as the return trip was considered dangerous. Residents of villages including Madhoganj, Jaisingh Pura and Raja ka Bazaar were evicted to clear the area for the construction of Connaught Place and the development of its nearby areas. The villages were once situated along the historic Qutb Road, the main road connecting Shahjahanabad, the walled city of Delhi (now known as Old Delhi) to Qutb Minar in south Delhi since the Mughal era. The displaced people were relocated in Karol Bagh to the west, a rocky area populated only by trees and wild bushes. However, three structures were spared demolition. These were Hanuman temple, a Jain temple in Jaisinghpura and the Jantar Mantar. =Construction= left Plans to have a central business district were developed as the construction of the new capital of Imperial India began to take shape. Headed by W.H. Nicholls, the chief architect to the Government of India, the plans featured a central plaza based on the European Renaissance and in the Classical style. However Nicholls left India in 1917, and with Lutyens and Baker busy working on larger buildings in the capital, design of the plaza eventually fell to Robert Tor Russell, chief architect to the Public Works Department (PWD), Government of India. Named after Prince Arthur, 1st Duke of Connaught (1850‚Äì1942), third son of Queen Victoria and uncle of King George VI of England, who visited India in 1921 and laid the foundation of the Council House (now Sansad Bhavan, or Parliament House). Connaught Place's Georgian architecture is modelled after the Royal Crescent in Bath, designed by the architect John Wood the Younger and built between 1767 and 1774. While the Royal Crescent is semi-circular and a three storied residential structure, Connaught Place had only two floors, which made almost a complete circle intended to house commercial establishments on the ground with residential space on the first floor. The circle was eventually designed with two concentric circles, creating an Inner Circle, Middle Circle and the Outer Circle with seven roads radiating from a circular central park known as Radial Roads. As per the original plan, the different blocks of Connaught Place were to be joined from above, employing archways, with radial roads below them. However, the circle was 'broken up' to give it a grander scale. Even the blocks were originally planned to be in height but later reduced to the present two-storied structure with an open colonnade. Government plans to have New Delhi Railway Station built inside Central Park were rejected by railway authorities as they found the idea impractical, and instead chose the nearby Paharganj area. Finally construction work began in 1929, with the construction of the Viceroy House (present Rashtrapati Bhavan), Secretariat Building, Parliament House, and All-India War Memorial, India Gate were completed by 1933, long after the inauguration of the city in 1931. =Early years= alt=Early commercial establishments belonged to traders from the Kashmere Gate area: Kanter's, Galgotia and Snowhite. Some of the other oldest and still existing establishments include Ram Chandra & Sons (since 1935), Novex (since 1937), Dhoomi Mal Gallery (since 1936), Vaish at Rivoli (since 1939), Indian Arts Palace (since 1935), Mahatta & Company (since 1947). Most of the rulers of the Indian princely states had their local homes in the nearby areas around King's way (modern-day Rajpath), and would frequent shops for designer clothes, artefacts, shoes, and pianos. Regal cinema, the first cinema in Connaught Place, opened around this time and went on to host popular concerts, theatre groups, and ballet performances. The Odeon and Rivoli followed the Regal, while the Indian Talkie House opened in 1938. Initially only Indian snacks were available in the area, but gradually restaurants opened in the plaza, with names like Kwality, United Coffee House and others offering Continental and Mughlai cuisines. Wenger's, the confectioners, was one of the first shops in Connaught Place, the firm also owned the largest restaurant in New Delhi on the first floor of their present A-Block outlet. Originally established in 1926 as Spencers in Kashmere Gate, Wenger's was owned by a Swiss couple and introduced Delhi to pastries and homemade Swiss chocolates, though in its early years it too was patronised mostly by British officers, Indian royalty and some foreign-returned businessmen, for Delhi was still the city of classical taste within the walled city. Over the years Wenger's started another shop right beside their previous one in Connaught Place's A Block, which earlier belonged to Harnarains, a Pickle brand that has been in existence since 1860s. Harnarains currently operates under the name Harnarains International. Davico's across Connaught Plaza, and the Standard restaurant was popular for decades before fading away. Another old timer, the Embassy Restaurant, opened in 1948. The Imperial, New Delhi's first luxury hotel opened in 1931 on Queen's Way, (modern-day Janpath) and eventually became a haunt for the royalty and a place for political discussions. It was here that Jawaharlal Nehru, Mohandas K. Gandhi, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Lord Mountbatten met to discuss the Partition of India and the birth of Pakistan.The Imperial, New Delhi The New York TimesFamous Hotels: Imperial New Delhi ‚Äì the making of By Andreas Augustin. 4hoteliers.com. 11 December 2006. LIC building, Connaught Place, Outer Circle, built in 1986 Residents gradually moved into first floor quarters, which were almost full by 1938, but it was another decade before the plaza became the busy marketplace that it became later, as World War II started and the Independence movement reached a feverish pitch. Markets experienced dwindling sales, but post- independence business began to increase in the 1950s. =Post-independence= Until the 1980s, a Phatphat Sewa, a Harley Davidson rickshaw service, took visitors from Connaught Place to the Red Fort and Chandani Chowk, before it was stopped due to pollution concerns. The empty block of the Inner Circle came into use in the late 1970s with the construction of an underground market, the first in Delhi, Palika Bazaar at the junction point. Stretching up to the Outer Circle, it also came with an adjoining underground parking lot. Also in the 1970s, the State Emporiums on Baba Karak Singh Marg radial emerged. However, a major alteration in the skyline was the addition of red sandstone (inspired by the historic Red Fort) and glass skyscraper, the Jeevan Bharti building (LIC building), designed by architect Charles Correa. In 1986, it towered over the low-lying and predominantly white Connaught Place and was criticised for being too futuristic, but gradually as other skyscrapers were built on the periphery, the debate faded away. Cinemas Regal cinema, Connaught Place's first theatre, opened in 1932, built by Sir Sobha Singh, designed by Walter Sykes George.After the introduction of talkies to Indian cinema in 1931, the new medium became a craze and in the 1930s and the 40s, four theatres opened within Connaught Place Plaza: Regal, Rivoli, Odeon and a short-lived \\"Indian Talkie House\\" that opened in 1938. Connaught Place became the entertainment hub of New Delhi. The Regal, the first theatre in the area, was opened in 1932 by Sir Sobha Singh. It was designed by architect Walter Sykes George and mainly hosted stage performances. In the coming years it hosted Western Classical music artists, Russian ballet and British theatre groups, and soon started morning and afternoon movie shows. The next theatre to be built was the Plaza in 1940, designed by Sir Robert Tor Russell, the architect of Connaught Place itself. It was owned by director and actor Sohrab Modi until the early 1950s. The Odeon was built in 1945 and had the city's second 70mm screen after the \\"Shiela Cinema\\" in Paharganj. The Rivoli, close to the Regal, was the smallest theatre in the area. Half a century later most of the theatres were still running, although most had changed ownership. The Plaza and Rivoli are now owned by a multiplex giant PVR Cinemas, while the Odeon is a joint venture with Reliance Big Pictures. Today Entrance of the underground shopping complex, Palika Bazaar, in Connaught Place, built in the 1970s Connaught Place on a busy weekend The area is instantly recognisable on any map of Delhi as a big circle in the middle with radial roads spreading out in all directions. Eight separate roads lead out from Connaught Places's inner circle, named Parliament Street and Radial Roads 1 through 7. Twelve different roads lead out from Connaught Circus, the outer ring. The best known of these is Janpath, the continuation of Radial Road 1. It is a logically planned area and houses one of India's first underground markets, the Palika Bazaar (Municipal Market), named after nagarpalika. The Outer Circle is known as the Connaught Circus (officially Indira Chowk), having rows of restaurants, shops and hotels, and on 1 December 2017, The Regal Building was reopened as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, the very first in India. The Middle Circle has offices, Banks, Exchange houses such as Thomascook, Atwexchange, PVR cinema and eating outlets. = Central Park = Connaught Place's central park has long been a venue for cultural events and is a popular hangout for locals. In 2005‚Äì06, it was rebuilt after the construction of the Delhi Metro station below it. That station, Rajiv Chowk, is the interchange for the Yellow and Blue lines of the Metro and one of the largest and busiest stations in the network. Connaught Place hosts various cultural events in the central park area such as the Urdu Heritage Festival, One Billion Rising demonstrations, Delhi Government's Youth Festival, Awam Ki Awaz (Voices of People) concert and many others. =National flag at Central Park= National Flag of India at Central Park, Connaught Place The first known Indian to hoist the tricolour flag at Connaught Place is Padma Shri Mir Mushtaq Ahmad, the first Chief Executive Councillor of Delhi. Prior to independence, when Connaught Place was considered the heart of imperial British India, he would hoist the tricolour at the bandstand in Central Park each year on 26 January. On 7 March 2014, the largest known Indian national tricolour at that time (now second largest) was hoisted at the centre of Central Park, measuring . The pole on which it is hoisted measures . Delhi blasts Two of the five terrorist blasts that occurred during the 13 September 2008 Delhi bombings were in Connaught Place. Ten people were injured after police and witnesses said that the bombs went off in garbage cans in and around Connaught Place. There was also one bomb blast in nearby Central Park. Authorities also discovered two undetonated bombs in Delhi, one located at the Regal cinema complex in Connaught Place. As a response, all rubbish bins were removed from the area for security reasons. Redevelopment plans By the late 2000s, Connaught Place had lost much of its old glory, although the charm of the market continued to attract foot traffic. As a part of its 'Return to Heritage Project', the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) prepared a plan to revamp and redevelop this Delhi landmark. The plan included the provision of heritage sensitive signage, engineering improvements of roads, drainage sewerage, water supply and substations, development of a traffic management plan, provisions of street furniture including adequate parking, walkways etc. and enhancing the structural stability of all buildings including retrofitting for earthquake resistance. All these components have been identified based on studies conducted by various reputed agencies such as SPA, RITES, CMCCC and NTPAC, etc. Connaught Place commercial area at Night The redevelopment work was slated to be completed in time for the 2010 Commonwealth Games held at Delhi, but due to huge cost overruns and undue delays, this deadline was not met. The Performance Audit Report prepared by Controller and Auditor General, India, on the Commonwealth Games 2010 concluded that there were \\"significant deficiencies in contract management, with consequent avoidable expenditure\\". Moreover, the mis-management and delays caused great inconvenience to shoppers and shop-owners alike, and led to a decline in trade. Many store-owners complained of erratic power supplies and lost air-conditioning in their shops during the renovation work. Work on the renovation was resumed soon after the Commonwealth Games, and is currently scheduled to meet the new deadline of December 2012. Till 2016 only the first phase for renovating blocks A & B has taken place. By 2020 all the six blocks of Connaught Place would be renovated and brought to their original glory. The art project United Buddy Bears was presented in Connaught Place during the summer of 2012. On 5 January 2017, the Union Urban Development Ministry announced a plan to convert the middle and inner circles of Connaught Place, into an exclusive pedestrian zone, starting February 2017. As a result, people driving into the area will now have to park their vehicles at designated parking slots like Shivaji Stadium, Palika Bazaar and then either walk to Connaught Place or use the shuttle bus service. However, Bicycles will be allowed in the pedestrian zones. This move however does not have any planning as of 24 January 2017 and may be totally scrapped as the current infrastructure is insufficient to support the pedestrianisation of Connaught Place, Naresh Kumar Chairman of NDMC Reported Hindustan Times. Films Over the years, Connaught Place has been location many films including sequences in Dil Se.. (1998), Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi (2003), Pyaar Ke Side Effects (2006), 3 Idiots (2009), Aisha (2010), Delhi Belly (2011), Rockstar (2011), Ahista Ahista (2006), Agent Vinod, Vicky Donor (2012), Hate Story (2011), Special 26 (2013), A Wednesday (2008), Rang De Basanti (2006), PK (2014) and 2 States (2014).

The Griffon Bruxellois may refer to three different breeds, the Griffon Bruxellois, the Griffon Belge and the Petit Braban√ßon. Identical in standard except for coat and colour differences, in some standards they are considered varieties of the same breed, much like Belgian Shepherd Dogs. History Shorthaired Petit Braban√ßon The three variations of this dog, the Brussels Griffon (Griffon Bruxellois), the Belgian Griffon (Griffon Belge), and the Petit Braban√ßon, all descend from dog called a Smousje, a rough coated, small terrier-like dog kept in stables to eliminate rodents, similar to the Dutch Smoushond. The little coarse-haired dog in the foreground of the Jan van Eyck painting The Arnolfini Marriage is thought to be an early form of this breed. In Belgium coachmen were fond of their alert little Griffons d‚ÄôEcurie (wiry coated stable dogs) and in the 19th century, they bred their Griffons with imported toy dogs. Breeding with the Pug and King Charles Spaniel brought about the current breed type, but also brought the short black coat that led to the Petits Braban√ßon, which was originally a fault in the breed. The spaniels also brought the rich red and black and tan colour of the modern Griffon Bruxellois and Griffon Belge. The Griffon Bruxellois grew in popularity in the late 19th century with both workers and noblemen in Belgium. The first Griffon Bruxellois was registered in 1883 in the first volume Belgium's kennel club studbook, the Livre des Origines Saint- Hubert (LOSH). The popularity of the breed was increased by the interest of Queen Marie Henriette, a dog enthusiast who visited the annual dog shows in Belgium religiously, often with her daughter, and became a breeder and booster of Griffon Bruxellois, giving them international fame and popularity. Many dogs were exported to other countries, leading to Griffon Bruxellois clubs in England (1897) and Brussels Griffon clubs in the U.S. (1945.) The First World War and Second World War proved to be a disastrous time for the breed. War time is difficult on any dog breed, and the recovering numbers after the First World War were set back by increased vigilance in breeding away from faults such as webbed toes. By the end of the Second World War, Belgium had almost no native Griffon Bruxellois left, and it was only through the vigilance of dedicated breeders (in the U.K. particularly) that the breed survived at all. The breed has never been numerous or popular, but had a brief vogue in the late 1950s, and now is generally an uncommon breed. There has been a recent increase in interest in the United States due to the appearance of a Griffon in the movie, As Good as It Gets, and also because of a general increase in interest in toy dogs.  Description  The Brussels Griffon is typically a small breed with a sturdy frame. The average adult Griffon stands from tall, and weighs . They have domed heads, short noses, and an underbite. Their human-like facial features are often likened to that of an Ewok. The Griffon comes in two coat variants, wiry/rough and smooth coat. Their hair (not fur) can be red, black and tan, or black and reddish in color. The short hair Griffon requires little grooming while the wiry/rough coat Griffon requires weekly grooming attention. Generally, breeders will dock tails and crop ears on puppies for sale. This practice is illegal in most of Europe and increasingly frowned on in the United States, but still practiced in some places. =Temperament= The Griffon Bruxellois is known to have a huge heart, and a strong desire to snuggle and be with its master. They display a visible air of self-importance. A Griffon should not be shy or aggressive, but they are very emotionally sensitive, and because of this, should be socialized carefully at a young age. Griffons should also be alert, inquisitive and interested in their surroundings. Griffons tend to bond with one human more than others. In fact, Griffons are very good with children provided they are not teased. They are not very patient but do love to play. Griffons tend to get along well with other animals in the house, including cats, ferrets, and other dogs. However, they can get into trouble because they have no concept of their own relative size and may attempt to dominate dogs much larger than themselves.

Cayafa's Celebrity.jpgBrussels Griffon Health Griffon Bruxellois Petit Braban√ßon puppy Despite being a Toy dog, the breed is very active. A Petit Braban√ßon Griffons have relatively few inherited health problems, but should still be tested for congenital defects, the most serious of which are Syringomyelia (SM) and Chiari-like malformation (CM). The typical life span of a Griffon is somewhere in the range of 10 to 15 years. =Birthing= A Griffon puppy Griffons usually have no trouble whelping on their own, but sometimes complications can necessitate a Caesarean section. The size of a litter is typically 1-3 puppies. The size of the litter often determines the extent of these complications. Litters of six are not unheard of. When they are born, the puppies only weigh a few ounces (about 100 grams) and are small enough to fit in the palm of an adult's hand. They can get leg and heart problems from an early age. =Cleft palate= One issue that is typically fatal for the puppies is having a cleft palate. It results in the puppy not receiving nourishment from the mother and eventually starvation. It is uncommon but, depending on the size of the cleft, it is possible for the puppy to survive, when it becomes older surgery can be done to close the hole. =Eyes= Most have large eyes that may require rechecks from a veterinarian. *Lacerations - Lacerations are a common issue amongst the breed. Because the Griffons have such large eyes and a short snout, there is very little there to protect their vision from foreign bodies. If a laceration is left untreated it can result in blindness. *Cataracts - As with most breeds, cataracts are a common problem as the dog ages. For many breeders it is a disappointment that the cataracts typically develop long after the dog has already been bred. *Lens Luxations - Lens luxations can be fairly common in the breed and result in secondary glaucoma *Glaucoma - Glaucoma can also be a common issue amongst Griffons owing to the breed's facial features and eye size. =Heat stroke= Although Griffons have a shortened snout, heat stroke is not a major concern for them as it is with other flat-faced breeds. The breed's shortened muzzle may cause respiratory problems in extreme heat, but overall they tolerate both hot and cold weather well. As with any breed, owners must use common sense and not leave them outdoors without protection from the elements or subject them to rigorous exercise during extreme temperatures, so let them in your house for cool air and some water. =Syringomyelia= Syringomyelia (SM) is a condition affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. Syringomyelia is characterised by fluid filled cavities within the spinal cord. SM occurs secondary to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) especially if that obstruction is at the foramen magnum. To date the condition has been also reported in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, King Charles Spaniels, Yorkshire Terriers, Maltese Terriers, Chihuahuas, Miniature Dachshunds, Miniature/Toy Poodles, Bichon Fris√©, Pugs, Shih Tzus, Pomeranians, Boston Terriers, French Bulldogs, a Pekingese, a Miniature Pinscher, mixbreeds, and a couple of cats. Not all dogs with SM have clinical signs. The presence of signs is correlated to the width of the syrinx and extent of spinal cord dorsal horn damage. Syrinxes can progressively expand and a dog which is asymptomatic in early life may eventually experience pain.

He had enlisted the help of the two heroes, Krishna and Arjuna. Arjuna was one of the best and greatest archers of all time and demanded from Agni a bow that would suit his strength, skill and the power of celestial weapons.

Set in early 19th-century Paris, it tells the story of a young man who finds a magic piece of shagreen that fulfills his every desire. For each wish granted, however, the skin shrinks and consumes a portion of his physical energy. La Peau de chagrin belongs to the √âtudes philosophiques group of Balzac's sequence of novels, La Com√©die humaine. Before the book was completed, Balzac created excitement about it by publishing a series of articles and story fragments in several Parisian journals. Although he was five months late in delivering the manuscript, he succeeded in generating sufficient interest that the novel sold out instantly upon its publication. A second edition, which included a series of twelve other \\"philosophical tales\\", was released one month later. Although the novel uses fantastic elements, its main focus is a realistic portrayal of the excesses of bourgeois materialism. Balzac's renowned attention to detail is used to describe a gambling house, an antique shop, a royal banquet, and other locales. He also includes details from his own life as a struggling writer, placing the main character in a home similar to the one he occupied at the start of his literary career. The central theme of La Peau de chagrin is the conflict between desire and longevity. The magic skin represents the owner's life-force, which is depleted through every expression of will, especially when it is employed for the acquisition of power. Ignoring a caution from the shopkeeper who offers him the skin, the protagonist greedily surrounds himself with wealth, only to find himself miserable and decrepit at the story's end. La Peau de chagrin firmly established Balzac as a writer of significance in France. His social circle widened significantly, and he was sought eagerly by publishers for future projects. The book served as the catalyst for a series of letters he exchanged with a Polish baroness named Ewelina Ha≈Ñska, who later became his wife. It also inspired Giselher Klebe's opera Die t√∂dlichen W√ºnsche. Background Honor√© de Balzac spent ten years failing as an author before he wrote La Peau de chagrin. In 1830 Honor√© de Balzac had only begun to achieve recognition as a writer. Although his parents had persuaded him to make his profession the law, he announced in 1819 that he wanted to become an author. His mother was distraught, but she and his father agreed to give him a small income, on the condition that he dedicate himself to writing, and deliver to them half of his gross income from any published work.Robb, pp. 52‚Äì53; Gerson, p. 29; Maurois, pp. 51‚Äì54. The amount he received from his parents is disputed; Gerson says it was 750 francs per year; Maurois indicates 1500. Robb writes that his parents supported his new career \\"quite generously\\". After moving into a tiny room near the Biblioth√®que de l'Arsenal in Paris, Balzac wrote for one year, without success. Frustrated, he moved back to his family in the suburb of Villeparisis and borrowed money from his parents to pursue his literary ambitions further. He spent the next several years writing simple potboiler novels, which he published under a variety of pseudonyms. He shared some of his income from these with his parents, but by 1828 he still owed them 50,000 francs.Maurois, pp. 72‚Äì128; Gerson, pp. 52‚Äì83. He published for the first time under his own name in 1829. Les Chouans, a novel about royalist forces in Brittany, did not succeed commercially, but it made Balzac known in literary circles.Gerson, pp. 90‚Äì92; Maurois, pp. 142‚Äì144. He achieved a major success later the same year when he published La Physiologie du mariage, a treatise on the institution of marriage. Bolstered by its popularity, he added to his fame by publishing a variety of short stories and essays in the magazines Revue de Paris, La Caricature, and La Mode. He thus made connections in the publishing industry that later helped him to obtain reviews of his novels.Robb, pp. 162‚Äì167; Gerson, p. 92; Maurois, pp. 155‚Äì156; Bellos, pp. 5‚Äì6. At the time, French literary appetites for fantastic stories had been whetted by the 1829 translation of German writer E. T. A. Hoffmann's collection Fantastic Tales; the gothic fiction of England's Ann Radcliffe; and French author Jules Janin's 1829 novel L'√Çne Mort et la Femme Guillotin√©e (The Dead Donkey and the Guillotined Woman).Bertault, pp. 59‚Äì60; Pritchett, p. 108. Although he planned a novel in the same tradition, Balzac disliked the term \\"fantastic\\", referring to it once as \\"the vulgar program of a genre in its first flush of newness, to be sure, but already too much worn by the mere abuse of the word\\".Quoted in Bertault, p. 60. The politics and culture of France, meanwhile, were in upheaval. After reigning for six controversial years, King Charles X was forced to abdicate during the July Revolution of 1830. He was replaced by Louis-Philippe, who named himself \\"King of the French\\" (rather than the usual \\"King of France\\") in an attempt to distance himself from the Ancien R√©gime. The July Monarchy brought an entrenchment of bourgeois attitudes, in which Balzac saw disorganization and weak leadership.Robb, pp. 177‚Äì178; Gerson, pp. 98‚Äì99; Maurois, pp. 192‚Äì193. Writing and publication Balzac publicized the novel he was writing in the Parisian journal La Caricature. The title La Peau de chagrin first appeared in print on 9 December 1830, as a passing mention in an article Balzac wrote for La Caricature under the pseudonym Alfred Coudreux. His scrapbook includes the following note, probably written at the same time: \\"L'invention d'une peau qui repr√©sente la vie. Conte oriental.\\" (\\"The invention of a skin that represents life. Oriental story.\\")Millott, p. 68. One week later, he published a story fragment called \\"Le Dernier Napol√©on\\" in La Caricature, under the name \\"Henri B...\\". In it, a young man loses his last Napoleon coin at a Parisian gambling house, then continues to the Pont Royal to drown himself. During this early stage, Balzac did not think much of the project. He referred to it as \\"a piece of thorough nonsense in the literary sense, but in which [the author] has sought to introduce certain of the situations in this hard life through which men of genius have passed before achieving anything\\".Quoted in Maurois, p. 174. Before long, though, his opinion of the story improved. By January 1831 Balzac had generated enough interest in his idea to secure a contract with publishers Charles Gosselin and Urbain Canel. They agreed on 750 copies of an octavo edition, with a fee of 1,125 francs paid to the author upon receipt of the manuscript ‚Äì by mid- February. Balzac delivered the novel in July.Millott, pp. 68‚Äì69; Robb, p. 179; Gerson, p. 103; Maurois, p. 175. The exact amount of the fee is disputed: Millott and Robb list 1,125 francs; Maurois lists 1,135; and Gerson writes: \\"Canel paid him an advance royalty of two thousand francs for the work.\\" Balzac's friend George Sand was among the first to read the manuscript as it neared completion. During the intervening months, however, he provided glimpses of his erratic progress. Two additional fragments appeared in May, part of a scheme to promote the book before its publication. \\"Une D√©bauche\\", published in the Revue des deux mondes, describes an orgiastic feast that features constant bantering and discussion from its bourgeois participants. The other fragment, \\"Le Suicide d'un po√®te\\", was printed in the Revue de Paris; it concerns the difficulties of a would-be poet as he tries to compensate for his lack of funds. Although the three fragments were not connected into a coherent narrative, Balzac was excerpting characters and scenes from his novel-in-progress.Millott, pp. 69‚Äì71. The novel's delayed publication was a result of Balzac's active social life. He spent many nights dining at the homes of friends, including novelist Eug√®ne Sue and his mistress Olympe P√©lissier, as well as the feminist writer George Sand and her lover Jules Sandeau. Balzac and P√©lissier had a brief affair, and she became the first lover with whom he appeared in public. Eventually he removed himself from Paris by staying with friends in the suburbs, where he committed himself to finishing the work. In late spring he allowed Sand to read a nearly- finished manuscript; she enjoyed it and predicted it would do well.Gerson, pp. 103‚Äì104; Maurois, pp. 175‚Äì176. Finally, in August 1831, La Peau de chagrin: Conte philosophique was published in two volumes. It was a commercial success, and Balzac used his connections in the world of Parisian periodicals to have it reviewed widely. The book sold quickly, and by the end of the month another contract had been signed: Balzac would receive 4,000 francs to publish 1,200 additional copies. This second edition included a series of twelve other stories with fantastic elements, and was released under the title Romans et contes philosophiques (Philosophical Novels and Stories). A third edition, rearranged to fill four volumes, appeared in March 1833.Millott, pp. 70‚Äì71; Maurois, pp. 180‚Äì181. Synopsis La Peau de chagrin consists of three sections: \\"Le Talisman\\" (\\"The Talisman\\"), \\"La Femme sans c≈ìur\\" (\\"The Woman without a Heart\\"), and \\"L'Agonie\\" (\\"The Agony\\"). The first edition contained a \\"Preface\\" and a \\"Moralit√©\\", which were excised from subsequent versions. A two-page Epilogue appears at the end of the final section. Arabic writing engraved into the shagreen promises that the owner \\"shal[l] possess all things\\".The full translation in the book is as follows: \\"Possessing me thou shalt possess all things. / But thy life is mine, for God has so willed it. / Wish, and thy wishes shall be fulfilled; / but measure thy desires, according / to the life that is in thee. / This is thy life, / with each wish I must shrink / even as thy own days. / Wilt thou have me? Take me. / God will hearken unto thee. / So be it!\\" Balzac, p. 30. (\\"Amen\\" may be a more accurate translation of the final line.) \\"Le Talisman\\" begins with the plot of \\"Le Dernier Napol√©on\\": A young man named Rapha√´l de Valentin wagers his last coin and loses, then proceeds to the river Seine to drown himself. On the way, however, he decides to enter an unusual shop and finds it filled with curiosities from around the world. The elderly shopkeeper leads him to a piece of shagreen hanging on the wall. It is inscribed with \\"Oriental\\" writing; the old man calls it \\"Sanskrit\\", but it is imprecise Arabic.Todd, Jane Marie. \\"Balzac's Shaggy Dog Story\\". Comparative Literature. 44.3 (Summer 1993): 268‚Äì279. The skin promises to fulfill any wish of its owner, shrinking slightly upon the fulfillment of each desire. The shopkeeper is willing to let Valentin take it without charge, but urges him not to accept the offer. Valentin waves away the shopkeeper's warnings and takes the skin, wishing for a royal banquet, filled with wine, women, and friends. He is immediately met by acquaintances who invite him to such an event; they spend hours eating, drinking, and talking. Part two, \\"La Femme sans c≈ìur\\", is narrated as a flashback from Valentin's point of view. He complains to his friend √âmile about his early days as a scholar, living in poverty with an elderly landlord and her daughter Pauline, while trying fruitlessly to win the heart of a beautiful but aloof woman named Foedora. Along the way he is tutored by an older man named Eug√®ne de Rastignac, who encourages him to immerse himself in the world of high society. Benefiting from the kindness of his landladies, Valentin maneuvers his way into Foedora's circle of friends. Unable to win her affection, however, he becomes the miserable and destitute man found at the start of \\"Le Talisman\\". \\"L'Agonie\\" begins several years after the feast of parts one and two. Valentin, having used the talisman to secure a large income, finds both the skin and his health dwindling. He tries to break the curse by getting rid of the skin, but fails. The situation causes him to panic, horrified that further desires will hasten the end of his life. He organizes his home to avoid the possibility of wishing for anything: his servant, Jonathan, arranges food, clothing, and visitors with precise regularity. Events beyond his control cause him to wish for various things, however, and the skin continues to recede. Desperate, the sickly Valentin tries to find some way of stretching the skin, and takes a trip to the spa town of Aix-les-Bains in the hope of recovering his vitality. With the skin no larger than a periwinkle leaf, he is visited by Pauline in his room; she expresses her love for him. When she learns the truth about the shagreen and her role in Rapha√´l's demise, she is horrified. Rapha√´l cannot control his desire for her and she rushes into an adjoining room to escape him and so save his life. He pounds on the door and declares both his love and his desire to die in her arms. She, meanwhile, is trying to kill herself to free him from his desire. He breaks down the door, they consummate their love in a fiery moment of passion, and he dies. Style Although he preferred the term \\"philosophical\\", Balzac's novel is based upon a fantastic premise. The skin grants a world of possibility to Valentin, and he uses it to satisfy many desires. Pressured into a duel, for example, he explains how he need neither avoid his opponent's gunshot nor aim his own weapon; the outcome is inevitable. He fires without care, and kills the other man instantly.Balzac, p. 250. Elsewhere, the supernatural qualities of the skin are demonstrated when it resists the efforts of a chemist and a physicist to stretch it.Balzac, pp. 210‚Äì221. This inclusion of the fantastic, however, is mostly a framework by which the author discusses human nature and society. One critic suggests that \\"the story would be much the same without it\\".Oliver, p. 82. Balzac had used supernatural elements in the potboiler novels he published under noms de plume, but their presence in Peau de chagrin signaled a turning point in his approach to the use of symbolism. Whereas he had used fantastic objects and events in earlier works, they were mostly simple plot points or uncomplicated devices for suspense. With La Peau de chagrin, on the other hand, the talisman represents Valentin's soul; at the same time, his demise is symbolic of a greater social decline.Dedinsky, p. 36. Balzac's real foci in the 1831 novel are the power of human desire and the nature of society after the July Revolution.Hunt, p. 39; Bertault, p. 61; Millott, p. 74; Affron, p. 84; Pritchett, p. 108. French writer and critic F√©licien Marceau even suggests that the symbolism in the novel allows a purer analysis than the individual case studies of other Balzac novels; by removing the analysis to an abstract level, it becomes less complicated by variations of individual personality. As an everyman, Valentin displays the essential characteristics of human nature, not a particular person's approach to the dilemma offered by the skin.Marceau, pp. 37‚Äì38. In his Preface to the novel's first edition, Balzac meditates on the usefulness of fantastic elements: \\"[Writers] invent the true, by analogy, or they see the object to be described, whether the object comes to them or they go toward the object ... Have men the power to bring the universe into their brain, or is their brain a talisman with which they abolish the laws of time and space?\\"Quoted in Bertault, p. 45. Original emphasis. Critics agree that Balzac's goal in La Peau de chagrin was the former. realist approach to storytelling. =Realism= The novel is widely cited as an important early example of the realism for which Balzac became famous. Descriptions of Paris are one example: the novel is filled with actual locations, including the Palais Royal and the Notre Dame Cathedral. The narration and characters allude repeatedly to art and culture, from Gioachino Rossini's opera Tancredi to the statue of Venus de Milo.Millott, pp. 74‚Äì75. The book's third paragraph contains a long description of the process and purpose behind the ritual in gambling houses whereby \\"the law despoils you of your hat at the outset.\\"Balzac, p. 2. The atmosphere of the establishment is described in precise detail, from the faces of the players to the \\"greasy\\" wallpaper and the tablecloth \\"worn by the friction of gold\\".Balzac, p. 4. The emphasis on money evoked in the first pages ‚Äì and its contrast with the decrepit surroundings ‚Äì mirrors the novel's themes of social organization and economic materialism.Millott, pp. 75‚Äì76. The confluence of realist detail with symbolic meaning continues when Valentin enters the antique shop; the store represents the planet itself. As he wanders about, he tours the world through the relics of its various epochs: \\"Every land of earth seemed to have contributed some stray fragment of its learning, some example of its art.\\" The shop contains a painting of Napoleon; a Moorish yataghan; an idol of the Tartars; portraits of Dutch burgomasters; a bust of Cicero; an Ancient Egyptian mummy; an Etruscan vase; a Chinese dragon; and hundreds of other objects.Balzac, pp. 14‚Äì17. The panorama of human activity reaches a moral fork in the road when the shopkeeper leads Valentin to Raphael's portrait of Jesus Christ. It does not deter him from his goal, however; only when he finds the skin does Valentin decide to abort his suicidal mission. In doing so, he demonstrates humanity favoring ego over divine salvation.Pasco, p. 131. =Opening image= The curvy line from Volume IX, Chapter IV of Laurence Sterne's 1759 novel Tristram Shandy is reprinted at the start of Balzac's novel.Sterne, Laurence. Tristram Shandy. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1980. . p. 426. The image in Balzac's novel is a mirror image of the original. At the start of the novel, Balzac includes an image from Laurence Sterne's 1759 novel Tristram Shandy: a curvy line drawn in the air by a character seeking to express the freedom enjoyed \\"whilst a man is free\\". Balzac never explained his purpose behind the use of the symbol, and its significance to La Peau de chagrin is the subject of debate. In his comprehensive review of La Com√©die humaine, Herbert J. Hunt connects the \\"serpentine squiggle\\" to the \\"sinuous design\\" of Balzac's novel.Hunt, p. 39. Critic Martin Kanes, however, suggests that the image symbolizes the impossibility of language to express an idea fully. This dilemma, he proposes, is directly related to the conflict between will and knowledge indicated by the shopkeeper at the start of the novel.Kanes, pp. 82‚Äì84. Themes =Autobiography= Balzac mined his own life for details in the first parts of La Peau de Chagrin, and he likely modeled the protagonist Rapha√´l de Valentin on himself. Details recounted by Valentin of his impoverished living quarters are autobiographical allusions to Balzac's earliest days as an author: \\"Nothing could be uglier than this garret, awaiting its scholar, with its dingy yellow walls and odor of poverty. The roofing fell in a steep slope, and the sky was visible through chinks in the tiles. There was room for a bed, a table, and a few chairs, and beneath the highest point of the roof my piano could stand.\\"Balzac, p. 87. Although they allow for a degree of embellishment, biographers and critics agree that Balzac was drawing from his own experience.Hunt, p. 40; Bertault, p. viii; Gerson, pp. 29‚Äì30; Maurois, p. 178. Gerson writes: \\"those who saw the garret, his sisters and Dr. Nacquart among them, agreed that he did not exaggerate.\\" On the other hand, Balzac's most recent biographer, Graham Robb, suggests on pp. 54‚Äì56 that Balzac exaggerated the place's squalor in order to represent a home worthy of a struggling poet. Other parts of the story also derive from the author's life: Balzac once attended a feast held by the Marquis de Las Marismas, who planned to launch a newspaper ‚Äì the same situation in which Valentin finds himself after expressing his first wish to the talisman.Robb, p. 182. Later, Valentin visits the opera armed with a powerful set of glasses that allow him to observe every flaw in the women on stage (to guard against desire). These may also have been drawn from Balzac's experience, as he once wrote in a letter about a set of \\"divine\\" opera glasses he ordered from the Paris Observatory.Robb, p. 183. Similarities exist between Olympe P√©lissier and the novel's \\"Woman without a Heart\\", but critics and biographers agree that the character is a composite of women from Balzac's life. More significant is the connection between the women in the novel and the women in Balzac's life. Some critics have noted important similarities between Valentin's efforts to win the heart of Foedora and Balzac's infatuation with Olympe P√©lissier.Oliver, p. 85; Gerson, p. 103; Robb, p. 182. A scene in which Valentin hides in Foedora's bedroom to watch her undress is said to come from a similar situation wherein Balzac secretly observed P√©lissier.Robb, p. 182; Maurois, p. 179. Robb notes that the rumor first appeared in a review that Balzac \\"had an opportunity to correct\\" ‚Äì thus proving either its veracity or a mutual agreement that it was a satisfying lie. He adds that \\"it is hard to imagine Balzac standing still behind a curtain for several hours.\\" It's probable that P√©lissier was not the model for Foedora, however, since she accepted Balzac's advances and wrote him friendly letters; Foedora, by contrast, declares herself outside the reach of any interested lover. Critics agree that the \\"Woman without a Heart\\" described in the novel is a composite of other women Balzac knew.Robb, p. 182; Maurois, p. 179; Oliver, p. 85; Hunt, p. 46; Pritchett, p. 108. Maurois insists: \\"[T]hat warm-hearted trollop bore no resemblance to the brilliant, mocking phantom of the story ... Foedora was certainly not Olympe P√©lissier.\\" The character of Pauline, meanwhile, was likely influenced by another of Balzac's mistresses, Laure de Berny.Hunt, p. 46; Oliver, p. 85. =Vouloir, pouvoir, and savoir= At the start of the book, the shopkeeper discusses with Valentin \\"the great secret of human life\\".Balzac, p. 31. They consist of three words, which Balzac renders in capital letters: VOULOIR (\\"to will\\"), POUVOIR (\\"to be able\\"), and SAVOIR (\\"to know\\"). Will, he explains, consumes us; power (or, in one translation, \\"to have your will\\") destroys us; and knowledge soothes us. These three concepts form the philosophical foundation of the novel.Hunt, pp. 42‚Äì43; Robb, p. 178; Bertault, p. 62; Raffini, pp. 217‚Äì218; Maurois, p. 174; Pasco, pp. 127‚Äì128; Kanes, pp. 66‚Äì67. The talisman connects these precepts to the theory of vitalism; it physically represents the life force of its owner, and is reduced with each exercise of the will. The shopkeeper tries to warn Valentin that the wisest path lies not in exercising his will or securing power, but in developing the mind. \\"What is folly\\", he asks Valentin, \\"if not an excess of will and power?\\"Balzac, p. 33. Overcome with the possibilities offered by the skin, however, the young man throws caution to the wind and embraces his desire.Robb, pp. 178‚Äì179; Hunt, p. 43‚Äì44. Upon grabbing the talisman, he declares: \\"I want to live with excess.\\" Only when his life force is nearly depleted does he recognize his mistake: \\"It suddenly struck him that the possession of power, no matter how enormous, did not bring with it the knowledge of how to use it ... [he] had had everything in his power, and he had done nothing.\\" The will, Balzac cautions, is a destructive force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development as an alternative to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own.Hunt, pp. 43‚Äì44. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret ‚Äì lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him ‚Äì underscores the irony of his misery at the end of the book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.Bertault, p. 62; Maurois, pp. 174‚Äì175; Pasco, pp. 127‚Äì128. =Society= Raphael's painting The Transfiguration comforts the novel's protagonist; the face of Jesus Christ is able to \\"cease the burning torment that consumed the marrow of his bones\\".Balzac, p. 26. The novel extrapolates Balzac's analysis of desire from the individual to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.Marceau, p. 93; Hunt, pp. 44‚Äì45; Millott, p. 77. Science offers no panacea. In one scene, a group of doctors offer a range of quickly formulated opinions as to the cause of Valentin's feebleness. In another, a physicist and a chemist admit defeat after employing a range of tactics designed to stretch the skin. All of these scientific approaches lack an understanding of the true crisis, and are therefore doomed to fail. Although it is only shown in glimpses ‚Äì the image of Christ, for example, painted by Valentin's namesake, the Renaissance artist Raphael ‚Äì Balzac wished to remind readers that Christianity offered the potential to temper deadly excess.Maurois, p. 183; Bertault, p. 92. After failing in their efforts to stretch the skin, the chemist declares: \\"I believe in the devil\\"; \\"And I in God\\", replies the physicist.Balzac, p. 221. The corruption of excess is related to social disorganization in a description at the start of the final section. Physically feeble though living in absolute luxury, Rapha√´l de Valentin is described as retaining in his eyes \\"an extraordinary intelligence\\" with which he is able to see \\"everything at once\\": > That expression was painful to see ... It was the inscrutable glance of > helplessness that must perforce consign its desires to the depths of its own > heart; or of a miser enjoying in imagination all the pleasures that his > money could procure for him, while he declines to lessen his hoard; the look > of a bound Prometheus, of the fallen Napoleon of 1815, when he learned at > the Elysee the strategical blunder that his enemies had made, and asked for > twenty-four hours of command in vain ...Balzac, p. 181. Reception and legacy Balzac's friend Th√©ophile Gautier paid tribute to Balzac's novel in his 1833 story collection Les Jeunes-France. The novel sold out immediately after going on sale, and was reviewed in every major Parisian newspaper and magazine. In some cases Balzac wrote the reviews himself; using the name \\"Comte Alex de B‚Äî\\", he announced that the book proved he had achieved \\"the stature of genius\\".Quoted in Maurois, p. 180. Independent reviews were less sweeping, but also very positive. Poet √âmile Deschamps praised the rhythm of the novel, and the religious commentator Charles Forbes Ren√© de Montalembert indicated approvingly that it highlighted the need for more spirituality in society as a whole.Bellos, p. 6. Although some critics chastised Balzac for reveling in negativity, others felt it simply reflected the condition of French society. German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe declared it a shining example of the \\"incurable corruption of the French nation\\". Critics argue about whether Goethe's comments were praise for the novel or not.Quoted in Robb, p. 181. This storm of publicity caused a flurry of activity as readers around France scrambled to obtain the novel. Balzac's friend and La Caricature editor Charles Philipon wrote to the author one week after publication: \\"there is no getting hold of La Peau de chagrin. Grandville had to stop everything to read it, because the librarian sent round every half-hour to ask if he had finished.\\" Friends near and far wrote to Balzac indicating their similar difficulties in locating copies.Maurois, p. 180. The second edition was released one month later, and it was followed by parodies and derivative works from other writers. Balzac's friend Th√©ophile Gautier included a comical homage in his 1833 story collection Les Jeunes-France when, during a recreation of the feast from Balzac's novel, a character says: \\"This is the point at which I'm supposed to pour wine down my waistcoat ... It says so in black and white on page 171 of La Peau de chagrin ... And this is where I have to toss a 100-sou coin in the air to see whether or not there's a God.\\" The novel established Balzac as a prominent figure in the world of French literature. Publishers fought among themselves to publish his future work, and he became a mainstay on the list of invitation for social functions around Paris.Gerson, pp. 105‚Äì106; Maurois, pp. 180‚Äì181. Balzac took pride in his novel's success, and declared to the editor of the journal L'Avenir that \\"Elle est donc le point de d√©part de mon ouvrage\\" (\\"This is the point of departure for my body of work\\").Quoted in Dedinsky, p. 37. Original emphasis Consistently popular even after his death, La Peau de chagrin was republished nineteen times between 1850 and 1880.Bellos, p. 92. When he developed his scheme for organizing all of his novels and stories into a single sequence called La Com√©die humaine, Balzac placed La Peau de chagrin at the start of the section called √âtudes philosophiques (\\"Philosophical Studies\\"). Like the other works in this category ‚Äì including the similarly autobiographical Louis Lambert (1832) ‚Äì it deals with philosophy and the supernatural. But it also provides a bridge to the realism of the √âtudes des m≈ìurs (\\"Study of Manners\\"), where the majority of his novels were located.Oliver, p. 84. =L'√âtrang√®re= Polish baroness Ewelina Ha≈Ñska wrote to Balzac after reading La Peau de chagrin, signing her letter L'√âtrang√®re (\\"The Stranger\\", \\"The Foreigner\\"). They married in 1850. The popularity of the novel extended to Ukraine, where a baroness named Ewelina Ha≈Ñska read about Balzac's novels in newspapers she received from Paris. Intrigued, she ordered copies of his work, and she read them with her cousins and friends around Volhynia. They were impressed by the understanding he showed toward women in La Physiologie du mariage, but felt that La Peau de chagrin portrayed them in a cruel and unforgiving light. Ha≈Ñska wrote a letter to Balzac, signed it as L'√âtrang√®re (\\"The Stranger\\"), and mailed it from Odessa on 28 February 1832.Robb. pp. 223‚Äì224; Gerson, pp. 154‚Äì155. Ha≈Ñska's signature L'√âtrangere is sometimes translated as \\"The Unknown\\" or \\"The Foreigner\\". With no return address, Balzac was left to reply in the Gazette de France, with the hope that she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: \\"Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its philosophical concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'\\"Quoted in Gerson, p. 155, and Maurois, p. 218. Eventually she revealed herself to him, and they began a correspondence that lasted for fifteen years. Although she remained faithful to her husband Wac≈Çaw, Mme. Ha≈Ñska and Balzac enjoyed an emotional intimacy through their letters. When the baron died in 1841, the French author began to pursue the relationship outside the written page. They wed in the town of Berdychiv on 14 March 1850, five months before he died.Robb, pp. 223‚Äì230 and 403. =Recurring characters= Because it was among the first novels he released under his own name, Balzac did not use characters in La Peau de chagrin from previous works. He did, however, introduce several individuals who resurfaced in later stories. Most significant of these is Eug√®ne de Rastignac, the older gentleman who tutors Valentin in the vicious ways of high society. Thirty pages into the writing of his 1834 novel Le P√®re Goriot, Balzac suddenly crossed out the name he had been using for a character ‚Äì Massiac ‚Äì and used Rastignac instead. The relationship between teacher and student in La Peau de chagrin is mirrored in Le P√®re Goriot, when the young Rastignac is guided in the ways of social realpolitik by the incognito criminal Vautrin.Dargan, p. 19. La Peau de chagrin is one of nearly 100 stories in Balzac's collection La Com√©die humaine. Balzac used the character Foedora in three other stories, but eventually wrote her out of them after deciding on other models for social femininity. In later editions of La Peau de chagrin, he changed the text to name one of the bankers \\"Taillefer\\", whom he had introduced in L'Auberge rouge (1831).Dunn, pp. 379‚Äì380. He also used the name Horace Bianchon for one of the doctors, thus connecting the book to the famous physician who appears in thirty-one stories in La Com√©die humaine. So vividly had the doctor been rendered that Balzac himself called out for Bianchon while lying on his deathbed.Robb, pp. 255 and 409. The use of recurring characters lends Balzac's work a cohesion and atmosphere unlike any other series of novels. It enables a depth of characterization that goes beyond simple narration or dialogue. \\"When the characters reappear\\", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, \\"they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see.\\"Rogers, p. 182. Although the complexity of these characters' lives inevitably led Balzac to make errors of chronology and consistency, the mistakes are considered minor in the overall scope of the project.Robb, p. 254. Readers are more often troubled by the sheer number of people in Balzac's world, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he \\"did not know where to begin\\".Quoted in Robb, p. 254; see generally Pugh. =Influence= Balzac's novel was adapted for the libretto of Giselher Klebe's 1959 opera Die t√∂dlichen W√ºnsche (The Deadly Wishes).\\"Klebe, Giselher ‚Äì Die t√∂dlichen W√ºnsche\\". Boosey & Hawkes. Retrieved 26 May 2008. 1977‚Äì1978 the German composer Fritz Gei√üler composed Das Chagrinleder after a libretto by G√ºnther Deicke. In 1989‚Äì1990 the Russian composer Yuri Khanon wrote the ballet L‚ÄôOs de chagrin (The Shagreen Bone), based on Balzac's text, which included an opera-interlude of the same name.Etv.net.ca, Os de Chagrin In 1992 a biographic pseudo-documentary in the form of an opera-film based on his opera L'os de Chagrin (¬´Chagrenevaia Kost¬ª,ru) was released. The novel has also been cited as a possible influence on Oscar Wilde for his 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, although this hypothesis is rejected by most scholars. The protagonist, Dorian Gray, acquires a magical portrait that ages while he remains forever youthful.Nickerson, Charles C. \\"Vivien Grey and Dorian Gray\\" .

Originally the ASU athletic teams' mascot was an owl, then became a \\"Normal\\" (because ASU was founded as a normal school). It was later changed to a bulldog in an attempt to make the school ‚Äì Arizona State Teacher's College at the time ‚Äì appear more in line with Yale and other universities that held a higher level of respect. The State Press, the student newspaper, ran frequent appeals during the fall of 1946, urging the Bulldog to be replaced by the new Sun Devil. On November 8, 1946, the student body voted 819 to 196 to make the change. On November 20, as reported by the Arizona Republic, the student council made it official. The following day, the first Arizona State team played as the Sun Devils. Two years later, alumnus and Disney illustrator Bert Anthony designed \\"Sparky\\", a devil holding a trident (colloquially referred to as a pitchfork). Anthony is rumored to have based Sparky's facial features on that of his former boss, Walt Disney. Sparky is officially known as a \\"mischievous imp\\", with no other backstory than that. Trademark In the 1970s and early 1980s, Orange Julius beverage stands used the image of a devil with a pitchfork around an orange. The company later dropped the logo after threats of a lawsuit from the alumni association. Redesign On March 1, 2013, Arizona State announced they were joining forces with the Walt Disney Company to redesign the mascot costume, as part of an effort to modernize the character, and planned to use the character in comic books, children books and animated features. The school also announced that they planned to continue using the iconic mark in various ways, including marketing and selling apparel alongside the new version of the character.http://www.thesundevils.com/genrel/030113aaa.html This change was met with backlash from students, alumni, and fans. Arizona State University President Michael Crow indicated that officials were meeting with student leaders to discuss the issue; afterwards, Sparky's new look was scrapped on March 19, 2013. The school later announced that it had created a program for members of the ASU community to vote on Sparky's redesign in which users were able to choose between different features for the mascot. The most popular features were used for a new look that will be fully unveiled at the first football game in the fall of 2013. His updated look includes many of the same features of the older mascot but with different material that is easier to clean. Unlike the more cartoon-like Sparky designed with Disney, the newest version is viewed as more representative of the historical drawing. It received 55% of the vote among 4 choices. A giant Sparky is used in the \\"Stomp the Bus\\" entrance video for the Sun Devils football team. =Pitchfork and Traditions= The hand gesture \\"The Pitchfork\\", which is widely used by those associated with Arizona State, is an extension of the pitchfork that Sparky carries during football games. On football game days, Sparky will do push-ups after every ASU score to match the total of points they have in the game. When ASU travels on the road for football, Sparky will do push-ups on his pitchfork supported by the ASU Spirit Squad.  Controversy  In September 2015, the Arizona State Sun Devils football team played a game against the University of New Mexico. At halftime, there was a ceremony that included many city officials for a ceremony to go along with the City of Tempe Night at the stadium. As the city officials were lined up on the sideline of the field, Sparky Sun Devil leaped on councilman David Schapira's back. What Sparky did not know, was that Schapira was still recovering from a back operation from July. Schapira filed a claim against the university over the injuries he suffered during the halftime ceremony. The university owed Schapira over $100,000.

That is to say, they contain a free, rhapsodic (though restrained) opening section that foreshadows the stylus phantasticus style of German composers later in the century (notably Dieterich Buxtehude), followed by an imitative, fugal section that strictly adheres to traditional contrapuntal rules.

Equity issuance can involve a private sale, in which the transaction between investors and the firm takes place directly, or publicly, in which case the firm has to register the securities with the authorities and the sale takes place in an organized market, open to any registered investor, a process more akin to an auction. Two common types of public equity issuance are initial public offerings (IPOs) and Secondary equity offerings (SEOs or FO). This is one of the ways firms finance themselves, that is, they obtain funds from investors in order to engage in business. Role of investment banks Investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are frequently intermediaries in the equity issue process, and for some of these firms the fees associated with IPOs are a substantial part of their income. The role of these banks is to study the characteristics and business plans of the firm which is issuing equity and then recommend a minimum purchase price to investors. On the other hand, they are in charge of convincing investors that the purchase is a good opportunity and therefore the success of IPO placement partly hinges on the reputation of the investment bank that is doing it.

After the death of Azes II, the rule of the Indo-Scythians in northwestern India and Pakistan finally crumbled with the conquest of the Kushans, one of the five tribes of the Yuezhi who had lived in Bactria for more than a century, and who were then expanding into India to create a Kushan Empire. Soon after, the Parthians invaded from the west. Their leader Gondophares temporarily displaced the Kushans and founded the Indo-Parthian Kingdom that was to last until the middle of the 1st century CE.

Azes II is also connected to the Bimaran casket, one of the earliest representations of the Buddha. The casket was part of the deposit of Stupa 2 in Bimaran, near Jalalabad in Afghanistan, and placed inside the stupa with several coins of Azes II. This event may have happened during the reign of Azes (35‚Äì12 BCE), or slightly later. The Indo-Scythians are otherwise connected with Buddhism (see Mathura lion capital and the multiple Buddhist dedications of the Apracas), and it is indeed possible they would have commended the work. However it now thought that a later king, issuing coins in the name of Azes, such as Kharahostes, made the dedication. =Butkhara stupa= A coin of Azes II was found under a pillar with an Indo-Corinthian capital and sculpture of a Buddhist devotee in the Butkara Stupa, suggesting the involvement of Azes II in Buddhist dedications, and a datation for the sculpture corresponding to the reign of Azes II.Handbuch der Orientalistik, Kurt A.

A novel difference of the Indo-Scythians was to show the king on a horse, rather than his bust in profile as did the Greeks. Other coins of Azes depict the Buddhist lion and the Brahmanic cow of Shiva, suggesting religious tolerance towards his subjects.

In 1990, he resigned his seat in order to allow newly elected Liberal leader Jean Chr√©tien to enter the House of Commons through a by-election. Robichaud served as Special Assistant to the Leader of the Opposition until returning to the House in the 1993 election. With the election of Chr√©tien as Prime Minister, Robichaud became Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs. In 1994, he was appointed Secretary of State for Agriculture and Agri-Food, Fisheries, and Oceans.

Each rectangle's height and width is a Fibonacci number. The vertical bands have width 10. In mathematics, Zeckendorf's theorem, named after Belgian mathematician Edouard Zeckendorf, is a theorem about the representation of integers as sums of Fibonacci numbers. Zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be represented uniquely as the sum of one or more distinct Fibonacci numbers in such a way that the sum does not include any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers. More precisely, if is any positive integer, there exist positive integers , with , such that :N = \\\\sum_{i = 0}^k F_{c_i}, where is the th Fibonacci number. Such a sum is called the Zeckendorf representation of . The Fibonacci coding of can be derived from its Zeckendorf representation. For example, the Zeckendorf representation of 64 is :. There are other ways of representing 64 as the sum of Fibonacci numbers ‚Äì for example : : but these are not Zeckendorf representations because 34 and 21 are consecutive Fibonacci numbers, as are 5 and 3. For any given positive integer, its Zeckendorf representation can be found by using a greedy algorithm, choosing the largest possible Fibonacci number at each stage. History While the theorem is named after the eponymous author who published his paper in 1972, the same result had been published 20 years earlier by Gerrit Lekkerkerker.Historical note on the name Zeckendorf Representation by R Knott, University of Surrey As such, the theorem is an example of Stigler's Law of Eponymy. Proof Zeckendorf's theorem has two parts: #Existence: every positive integer has a Zeckendorf representation. #Uniqueness: no positive integer has two different Zeckendorf representations. The first part of Zeckendorf's theorem (existence) can be proven by induction. For it is clearly true (as these are Fibonacci numbers), for we have . If is a Fibonacci number then we're done. Else there exists such that . Now suppose each has a Zeckendorf representation (induction hypothesis) and consider . Since , has a Zeckendorf representation. At the same time, , so the Zeckendorf representation of does not contain . As a result, can be represented as the sum of and the Zeckendorf representation of . The second part of Zeckendorf's theorem (uniqueness) requires the following lemma: :Lemma: The sum of any non-empty set of distinct, non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers whose largest member is is strictly less than the next larger Fibonacci number . The lemma can be proven by induction on . Now take two non- empty sets of distinct non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers and which have the same sum. Consider sets and which are equal to and from which the common elements have been removed (i.e. and ). Since and had equal sum, and we have removed exactly the elements from \\\\cap from both sets, and must have the same sum as well. Now we will show by contradiction that at least one of and is empty. Assume the contrary, i.e. that and are both non-empty and let the largest member of be and the largest member of be . Because and contain no common elements, . Without loss of generality, suppose . Then by the lemma, the sum of is strictly less than and so is strictly less than , whereas the sum of is clearly at least . This contradicts the fact that and have the same sum, and we can conclude that either or must be empty. Now assume (again without loss of generality) that is empty. Then has sum 0, and so must . But since can only contain positive integers, it must be empty too. To conclude: ‚àÖ which implies , proving that each Zeckendorf representation is unique. Fibonacci multiplication One can define the following operation a\\\\circ b on natural numbers , : given the Zeckendorf representations a=\\\\sum_{i=0}^kF_{c_i}\\\\;(c_i\\\\ge2) and b=\\\\sum_{j=0}^lF_{d_j}\\\\;(d_j\\\\ge2) we define the Fibonacci product a\\\\circ b=\\\\sum_{i=0}^k\\\\sum_{j=0}^lF_{c_i+d_j}. For example, the Zeckendorf representation of 2 is F_3, and the Zeckendorf representation of 4 is F_4 + F_2 (F_1 is disallowed from representations), so 2 \\\\circ 4 = F_{3+4} + F_{3+2} = 13 + 5 = 18. (The product is not always in Zeckendorf form. For example, 4 \\\\circ 4 = (F_4 + F_2) \\\\circ (F_4 + F_2) = F_{4+4} + 2F_{4+2} + F_{2+2} = 21 + 2\\\\cdot 8 + 3 = 40 = F_9 + F_5 + F_2.) A simple rearrangement of sums shows that this is a commutative operation; however, Donald Knuth proved the surprising fact that this operation is also associative. Representation with negafibonacci numbers The Fibonacci sequence can be extended to negative index using the rearranged recurrence relation :F_{n-2} = F_n - F_{n-1}, which yields the sequence of \\"negafibonacci\\" numbers satisfying :F_{-n} = (-1)^{n+1} F_n. Any integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of negafibonacci numbers in which no two consecutive negafibonacci numbers are used. For example:  * 0 is represented by the empty sum. , for example, so the uniqueness of the representation does depend on the condition that no two consecutive negafibonacci numbers are used. This gives a system of coding integers, similar to the representation of Zeckendorf's theorem. In the string representing the integer , the th digit is 1 if appears in the sum that represents ; that digit is 0 otherwise. For example, 24 may be represented by the string 100101001, which has the digit 1 in places 9, 6, 4, and 1, because . The integer is represented by a string of odd length if and only if .

It is a simulation and role-playing video game series dealing with sailing and trading, themed around the Age of Discovery. In the games, the player takes up the role of a captain (or commodore in some translations) and manages a seagoing fleet to participate in trades, privateering, treasure hunting, exploration, and plain piracy. Even though the series is largely open-ended, there is still a loose plot which requires the player to follow certain paths, and deviating from these paths may stall the progress of the story. In East Asia, the series has a large cult following, but it has not received much recognition outside the region. However, it has been compared to the earlier Sid Meier's Pirates! in gameplay and theme. Historical background In Japan, the term \\"daikoukai jidai\\" refers to the Age of Discovery, the period between the 15th century and the 17th century when European explorers sailed the seas to open new alternative ways to Asia when the Ottoman Empire blocked the land routes. This period was characterized by the rivalry between Spain and Portugal, the advent of colonization, and general exploration. In later games, other countries are also involved. Some historical events during the Age of Discovery, like the Treaty of Tordesillas, were mentioned. The game series makes many references to the historical background, although much like Pirates!, the more treacherous details of the era are idealized to create an adventurous and exciting mood.  Titles  =Uncharted Waters= In the first game of the series, the player assumes the role of Leon Franco, the young, ambitious son of a noble family fallen on hard times in Portugal. The goal of the game is to restore the family's former glory and achieve Leon's dreams. Only three nations are represented, Portugal, Spain and the Ottoman Empire, although there are many neutral ports around the world that the player can \\"invest\\" in and thus make part of Portugal's sphere of influence. This, as well as discovering ports and defeating other merchants and pirates in sea battles, increases Leon's fame. With increased fame, Leon can complete tasks for the King of Portugal and gain higher titles of nobility. The story is set in the early 16th century. It was released on MSX and NES in 1991, and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES in 1992; the SNES version was originally titled Super Daikoukai Jidai in Japan, as with many SNES ports of Koei games. The English versions were also released in the same years respectively. The game was ported to PC and Macintosh, as well. =Uncharted Waters: New Horizons= Also set in the 16th century, this game is a sequel to the first title and was released for NEC PC-98, SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive and PC in 1994. It also saw releases in 1996 on Sega Saturn and PlayStation in Japan exclusively. The SNES version was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console in Japan on March 17, 2009 and in North America on April 6, 2009 for the Wii. It was later released for the Wii U in Japan on October 30, 2013, in North America on November 14, 2013 and for the first time in Europe on November 28, 2013. In this game, there are six protagonists to choose from, each of them representing a different path or career featured in the game: * Jo√£o Franco: Son of Leon from the first game, a Portuguese explorer sent by his father to follow the family's footsteps and discover the secrets of the lost continent of Atlantis. * Catalina Erantzo: Former Spanish naval officer turned pirate, she avenges the loss of her brother and her fiance√© and suspects that the Franco family is behind this scheme. She is loosely based upon the historical character of Catalina de Erauso, the Lieutenant Nun. * Otto Baynes: English naval officer, a privateer sent by Henry VIII in a secret mission to defeat the Spanish Armada and prevent Spanish hegemony in the European continent. * Ernst von Bohr: Dutch teacher and cartographer, he is set to make a journey to far lands and with this experience create a map of the entire world. * Pietro Conti: Italian treasure hunter, he inherited a huge debt from his father and is set to travel for treasures and other secrets in order to cover the debt. * Ali Vezas: Turkish merchant, he grew up as an orphan in extreme poverty. With the help of his friend, he decides to become a trade merchant and find his lost sister. While the game is more or less open-ended, developing the character's career is necessary to advance the plot. At the time of release, the SNES version of the game is noted to contain superior music to the other ports of the game, as the game took advantage of the SNES' Nintendo S-SMP chip and used high quality instrument samples. On the other hand, the other console ports of the game at that time were released on consoles that used an OPL2 family chipset for music. While the PC could support high quality samples via the Sound Blaster AWE32 or Gravis Ultrasound family of cards, the PC port game did not take advantage of those advanced solutions, instead choosing to only be optimized for AdLib music cards, which used an OPL2 chip for music. The Saturn and PlayStation version contained enhanced FMV opening cutscenes. Reviewing the Genesis version, GamePro deemed the game an acquired taste due to the bare bones presentation and frequent money-managing, and concluded \\"If you have an interest in four masted voyages of European discovery, you could read a history book or play this game - the excitement levels are about the same.\\" Mobile Daikoukai Jidai 2 It is a mobile phone version of Daikoukai Jidai II series. Changes include: *Limiting character selection in a campaign game to 2 within the first month of subscription *Port interface is streamlined to eliminate moving player character within port. =Daikoukai Jidai III: Costa del Sol= Released in 1996 on PC, this title was the first to depart from the formula and engine of the series. The traditional focus on story was removed in this game, and some character customization is possible, if only purely decorative. There are two player characters from Portugal and Spain. Although the differences between them are mainly mechanical, the role- playing element was greatly reduced. The theme of exploration is heavily emphasized, as land travel is now possible, and there is a lot more to be explored and discovered overall, compared to the early titles. The game starts in the mid fifteenth century and allows for the player to make historical discoveries such as the New World or a route to India as well as conquer civilizations like the Aztec and Inca Empire. Also, the game experiments with the concept of language in a video game, a feature uncommon in the industry, and necessitating the hiring of translators and teachers. The player can also continue the game by marrying bar-girls and having children, who in turn can continue the seafaring tradition and even take on part of his father's skills and inventory. Perhaps it is due to these dramatic changes that Daikoukai Jidai 3 left players uncomfortable and failed to achieve much popularity even within Japan. At its initial release, this title caused some controversy for allowing slave trade in the game. The feature is disabled in later updates. Unlike most games in the series, this game was never released for consoles; it was only released for PC, working under Windows 2000. =Daikoukai Jidai Gaiden= Released in 1997 on PlayStation and Sega Saturn, the game uses the same engine as the II, and focuses on the story of two characters instead, further expounding upon the loose plot that ties the series together. The two protagonists are as follows: * Miranda Verte: Genoese adventurer who mistakenly thought the treasure hunter, Pietro Conti, had asked for her hand in marriage, and sets off to find him. Her quest eventually leads to a plot relating to an ancient civilization in South America, which were touched on by Pietro's previous adventure. * Salvador Reis: Pirate and adopted son of Hayreddin Reis (aka Khayr ad-Din). His adventure involves rising to fame as one of the Algerian pirates, compete for domination with enemy pirate clans and also struggle for power within his own clan. =Daikoukai Jidai IV: Porto Estado= The fourth game in the series was released for both PlayStation and PC under Windows 2000 and XP. This game returns to the previous formula, although its open-endedness has decreased and the engine has been updated. This title is plot-wise unrelated to the series that ended in Gaiden. Porto Estado is known for its fine art and high-quality illustrations. The story evolves on the search of the seven Proof of the Conqueror, which are seven ancient artifacts, in seven areas around the world (Northern Europe, Mediterranean, Africa, New World, Indian Ocean, South Asia and East Asia). It is said that having these proofs proves that the sailor is the champion of all sailors. Four sailors (plus another three in expansion) unwittingly involved in the struggle of the quest of the search of the Proof of the Conqueror. It is interesting that not all sailors are from Europe: two of the seven characters are from Asia (one from East Asia and another from southeast Asia), one from the Caribbean and another one from the Middle East. There are many significant changes in this game. For example, the game no longer has the concept of years and the result is that characters in this game will not age. The player can also set up regional fleets and these regional fleets are valuable financial resources. In combat, naval battle is now fought in real time. The country boundaries have disappeared. Each character is only represented by their own guild and their home country is not important in gameplay. Ports in this game also have a market share rating in a percentage scale. Players can trade in a port only when his guild has some market share in that port, which can be gained by signing a contract with the local governor. Native Windows 2000 and XP support are introduced in Koei rerelease and Sourcenext release for the Windows game. Daikoukai Jidai IV Porto Estado Powerup Kit This version adds the following: *3 new player characters and the associated scenario games. In those scenarios, players start at earlier time, and the game item locations and marine influences are also changed. *Accepting quests from guilds *Every January, first-class goods sold within markets controlled by player's shares can be branded. Player can earn shares for the surplus in branded goods for sales of the goods. *Introduction of mini-games in player selection? *Viewing bonus graphics when loading games. *Ability to view character profiles. *In Sourcenext version, native Windows 2000/XP support. Daikoukai Jidai IV Rota Nova Rota Nova was released by KOEI on March 23, 2006, for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS. This is a remake of Porto Estado for handhelds: * The PSP version includes a ship race function. * The DS version includes use of the stylus and map. Mobile Daikoukai Jidai 4 It is a mobile phone version of Daikoukai Jidai IV series. =Daikoukai Jidai V: Road to Zipang= It is a free to play web browser game, sequel to Daikoukai Jidai IV series. It is also available on Google Play and App Store (iOS). Daikoukai Jidai V Special Pack This version includes Sonia de la Cruz SR card (adds skill female intuition Lv.1), Rank X merchant vessel Black Herring (herring buss?), Scout Ticket Gold++, 1 million gold coins at start of game, 5000NP scouting points (adds 50 free scoutings).Â§ßËà™Êµ∑ÊôÇ‰ª£V „Çπ„Éö„Ç∑„É£„É´„Éë„ÉÉ„ÇØ =Uncharted Waters Online= Uncharted Waters Online offers much of the same gameplay experience seen in the single player games in a multiplayer environment. Players of the single player series will be well aware of similar concepts such as Missions, Adjutants, Investment, and National & Pirate NPC fleets. Country boundaries have reappeared, with more countries (Spain, Portugal, Venice, Ottoman Empire, France, England, and The Netherlands), however the concept of time is non- existent. The storyline is important to unlocking new areas in the game. The player now receives fame from activities such as battling, trading, discovering, and sailing.

Soundtracks The soundtracks for both Uncharted Waters and New Horizons were composed by Yoko Kanno. The soundtrack for Uncharted Waters Online is based in part on those works.Setting Sail Into 'Uncharted Waters', \\"Korean Times\\", July 28, 2005. Retrieved on December 27, 2007. Reception Dave Arneson in Computer Gaming World in 1992 criticized the first Uncharted Waters inaccurate history and geography, flawed and repetitive game play (\\"those who are looking for variety and surprises should weigh anchor and sail for another game\\"), and \\"one-dimensional\\" NPCs unlike those in other Koei games. He concluded, \\"when compared to what it could have been, it is more than mildly disappointing\\". In a 1993 survey of pre 20th- century strategy games the magazine gave the game zero stars out of five, stating that while its geography was inaccurate and user interface \\"could bear improvement\\", \\"Game play can be interesting\\".

It has a shorter effective range and lower engagement altitude than either of its predecessors and also flies slower, but due to its two-stage design it is more effective against more maneuverable targets. It is also able to engage lower flying targets than the previous systems, and being more modern it is much more resistant to ECM than the S-75. The 5V24 (V-600) missiles reach around Mach 3 to 3.5 in flight, both stages powered by solid fuel rocket motors. The S-125, like the S-75, uses radio command guidance. The naval version of this system has the NATO reporting name SA-N-1 Goa and original designation M-1 Volna (Russian –í–æ–ª–Ω–∞ ‚Äì wave). Operational history =Soviet Union= A pair of S-125 missiles in transit. Abandoned Soviet S-125 missile near Saare, Saaremaa, Estonia. The S-125 was first deployed between 1961 and 1964 around Moscow, augmenting the S-25 and S-75 sites already ringing the city, as well as in other parts of the USSR. In 1964, an upgraded version of the system, the S-125M \\"Neva-M\\" and later S-125M1 \\"Neva-M1\\" was developed. The original version was designated SA-3A by the US DoD and the new Neva-M named SA-3B and (naval) SA-N-1B. The Neva-M introduced a redesigned booster and an improved guidance system. The S-125 was not used against U.S. forces in Vietnam, because the Soviets feared that China (after the souring of Sino-Soviet relations in 1960), through which most, if not all of the equipment meant for North Vietnam had to travel, would try to copy the missile. =Angola= The FAPA-DAA acquired a significant number of S-125s, and these were encountered during the first strike flown by SAAF Mirage F.1s against targets in Angola ever - in June 1980. While the SAAF reported two aircraft were damaged by SAMs during this action, Angola claimed to have shot down four. On 7 June 1980, while attacking SWAPO's Tobias Haneko Training Camp during Operation Sceptic (Smokeshell), SAAF Major Frans Pretorius and Captain IC du Plessis, both flying Mirage F.1s, were hit by S-125s. Pretorius's aircraft was hit in a fuel line and he had to perform a deadstick landing at AFB Ondangwa. Du Plessis's aircraft sustained heavier damage and had to divert to Ruacana forward airstrip, where he landed with only the main undercarriage extended. Both aircraft were repaired and returned to service. =Middle East= S-125 on ZIL-131 transporter vehicle (9T911), Batey Ha-Osef Museum The Soviets supplied several S-125s to the Arab states in the late 1960s and 1970s, most notably Egypt and Syria. The S-125 saw extensive action during the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War. During the latter, the S-125, along with the S-75 Dvina and 2K12 Kub, formed the backbone of the Egyptian air defence network. In Egypt, March‚ÄìJuly 1970 Soviet battalions of S-125 17 Shooting (35 missiles) shot down nine Israeli and one Egyptian planes. General Muhammed Ali Hafez (Air defense forces commander in the Egyptian Army) was the first man in the world to reuse the launched missiles in creating new ones .–ó–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–Ω—ã–µ —Ä–∞–∫–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –≤–æ–π—Å–∫–∞ –≤ –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞—Ö –≤–æ –í—å–µ—Ç–Ω–∞–º–µ –∏ –Ω–∞ –ë–ª–∏–∂–Ω–µ–º –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–µ (–≤ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ 1965‚Äî1973 –≥–≥.). –ú.: –í–æ–µ–Ω–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç, 1980. –°. 215 Israel recognized the 5 F-4 Phantoms in 1970 (1 more was W/ORussia vs Israel) and in 1973 another 6 =Iraq= Remains of F-16C 87-257 as found by US ground forces in Iraq during Desert Storm. The canopy was recovered by US forces in the 2003 invasion. Still photograph from a videotape of an Iraqi surface-to-air missile, believed to be a S-125, launched at a coalition aircraft in July 2001. A USAF F-16 (serial 87-257) was shot down on January 19, 1991, during Operation Desert Storm. The aircraft was struck by a S-125 just south of Baghdad. The pilot, Major Jeffrey Scott Tice, ejected safely but became a POW as the ejection took place over Iraq. It was the 8th combat loss and the first daylight raid over Baghdad. On the opening night of Desert Storm, on 17 January 1991, a B-52G was damaged by a missile. Different versions of this engagement are told. It could have been a S-125 or a 2K12 Kub while other versions report a MiG-29 allegedly fired a Vympel R-27R missile and damaged the B-52G.Lake 2004, p. 48. However, the U.S. Air Force disputes these claims, stating the bomber was actually hit by friendly fire, an AGM-88 High-speed, Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) that homed on the fire-control radar of the B-52's tail gun; the jet was subsequently renamed In HARM's Way.Lake 2004, pp. 47‚Äì48. Shortly following this incident, General George Lee Butler announced that the gunner position on B-52 crews would be eliminated, and the gun turrets permanently deactivated, commencing on 1 October 1991.Condor 1994, p. 44. =FR Yugoslavia= A Yugoslav Army 250th Air Defense Missile Brigade 3rd battery equipped with S-125 system managed to shoot down an F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft on March 27, 1999 during the Kosovo War (the only recorded downing of a stealth aircraft) near village Budjanovci, about 45 km from Belgrade. The pilot LT.COL. Darrell Patrick Zelko managed to eject and was later found by US search & rescue forces. It was also used to shoot down a NATO F-16 fighter on May 2 (its pilot; Lt. Col David L. Goldfein, the commander of 555th Fighter Squadron, managed to eject and was later rescued by a combat search-and-rescue (CSAR) mission).Roberts, Chris. \\"Holloman commander recalls being shot down in Serbia\\" .

During the war, different Yugoslav SAM sites and possibly the S-125 also shot down some NATO UAVs. =Syrian Civil War= On 17 March 2015, a US MQ-1 Predator drone was shot down by a Syrian Air Defense Force S-125 missile while on intelligence flight near the coastal town of Latakia. In December 2016, ISIS forces captured three S-125 launchers after they retook Palmyra from Syrian government troops. On April 14, 2018, American, British, and French forces launched a barrage of 103 air-to-surface and cruise missiles targeting eight sites in Syria. The Russian military claimed that thirteen S-125 missiles launched in response destroyed five incoming missiles. However, the American Department of Defense stated no Allied missiles were shot down. Description The S-125 is somewhat mobile, an improvement over the S-75 system. The missiles are typically deployed on fixed turrets containing two or four but can be carried ready-to-fire on ZIL trucks in pairs. Reloading the fixed launchers takes a few minutes. =Missile= The S-125 system uses two different missile versions and variants. *V-600 (or 5V24) has the smallest warhead with 60 kg of high explosive. It has a range of about 15 km. *V-601 (or 5V27): the upgraded S-125M (1970) system uses the 5V27 missile, with a length of 6.09 m, a wing span of 2.2 m and a body diameter of 0.375 m. This missile weighs 953 kg at launch, and has a 70 kg warhead containing 33 kg of HE and 4,500 fragments. The minimum range is 3.5 km, and the maximum is 35 km (with the Pechora 2A). The intercept altitudes are between 100 m and 18 km. Other sources claim the intercept altitudes between 20 m and 14 km. The minimum range is 2.5 km, and the maximum is 22 km *5V27D: the S-125M1 (1978) system uses the 5V27D missile. In the early 1980s, each system used one or two radar simulators to survive antiradar missiles. =Radars= The launchers are accompanied by a command building or truck and three primary radar systems: * P-15 \\"Flat Face\\" or P-15M(2) \\"Squat Eye\\" 380 kW C-band target acquisition radar (also used by the SA-6 and SA-8, range 250 km/155 miles) * SNR-125 \\"Low Blow\\" 250 kW I/D-band tracking, fire control and guidance radar (range 40 km/25 miles, second mode 80 km/50 miles) * PRV-11 \\"Side Net\\" E-band height finder (also used by SA-2, SA-4 and SA-5, range 28 km/17 miles, max height 32 km/105,000 ft) \\"Flat Face\\"/\\"Squat Eye\\" is mounted on a van (\\"Squat Eye\\" on a taller mast for better performance against low-altitude targets also an IFF [Identifies Friend or Foe]), \\"Low Blow\\" on a trailer and \\"Side Net\\" on a box- bodied trailer. Variants and upgrades =Naval version= ZIF-101 launcher of Volna system on the Kashin class destroyer Strogiy. Work on a naval version M-1 Volna (SA-N-1) started in 1956, along with work on a land version. It was first mounted on a rebuilt Kotlin class destroyer (Project 56K) Bravyi and tested in 1962. In the same year, the system was accepted. The basic missile was a V-600 (or 4K90) (range: from 4 to 15 km, altitude: from 0.1 to 10 km). Fire control and guidance is carried out by 4R90 Yatagan radar, with five parabolic antennas on a common head. Only one target can be engaged at a time (or two, for ships fitted with two Volna systems). In case of emergency, Volna could be also used against naval targets, due to short response time. The first launcher type was the two-missile ZIF-101, with a magazine for 16 missiles. In 1963 an improved two-missile launcher, ZIF-102, with a magazine for 32 missiles, was introduced to new ship classes. In 1967 Volna systems were upgraded to Volna-M (SA-N-1B) with V-601 (4K91) missiles (range: 4‚Äì22 km, altitude: 0.1‚Äì14 km). In 1974 - 1976 some systems were modernized to Volna-P standard, with an additional TV target tracking channel and better resistance to jamming. Later, improved V-601M missiles were introduced, with lower minimal attack altitude against aerial targets (system Volna-N). Some Indian frigates also carry the M-1 Volna system. =Modern upgrades= Two S-125 dual missile launcher trailers. Newa SC Since Russia replaced all of its S-125 sites with SA-10 and SA-12 systems, they decided to upgrade the S-125 systems being removed from service to make them more attractive to export customers. * Released in 2000, the Pechora-2 version features better range, multiple target engagement ability and a higher probability of kill (PK). The launcher is moved onto a truck allowing much shorter relocation times. * It is also possible to fire the Pechora-2M system against cruise missiles. Deployment time 25 minutes, protected from the active interference, and anti-radiation missiles (total in practical shooting) Early warning radar is replaced by anti-stealth radar Kasta 2E2, target distance at 2.5‚Äì32 km, target altitude - 0.02‚Äì20 km, missile launchers can be positioned at up to 10 kilometers away from the control center. Speed up to 1000 m/s (target), Used rocket 5V27DE, by weight the warhead + 50% range of flight splinters + 350%. Probability of hitting the target 1st rocket: at a distance up to 25 km - 0,72-0,99, detection range with the radar cross section = 2 sq meters about 100 km, with RCS = 0.15 sq m - about 50 km, with no interference. When using active jamming - 40 km. ADMS \\"Pechora-2M\\" has the ability to interfacing with higher level command post and radar remote using telecode channels. Is equally effective at any time during the day and at night (optical location, daytime and nighttime, and also thermal imager) was awarded a contract to overhaul Egypt's S-125 SAM system. These refurbished weapons have been reintroduced as the S-125 Pechora 2M. * In 2001, Poland began offering an upgrade to the S-125 known as the Newa SC. This replaced many analogue components with digital ones for improved reliability and accuracy. This upgrade also involves mounting the missile launcher on a WZT-1 tank chassis (a TEL), greatly improving mobility and also adds IFF capability and data links. Radar is mounted on an 8-wheeled heavy truck chassis (formerly used for Scud launchers). Serbian modifications include terminal/camera homing from radar base. Cuba also developed a similar upgrade to the Polish one, which was displayed in La Habana in 2006. * Later the same year, the Russian version was upgraded again to the Pechora-M which upgraded almost all aspects of the system - the rocket motor, radar, guidance, warhead, fuse and electronics. There is an added laser/infra-red tracking device to allow launching of missiles without the use of the radar. There is also a version of the S-125 available from Russia with the warhead replaced with telemetry instrumentation, for use as target drones. * In October 2010, Ukrainian Aerotechnica announced a modernized version of S-125 named S-125-2D Pechora. As of 2018 according to the UkrOboronProm, the S-125 surface-to-air missile underwent an integrated modification of all elements, including modernization of missiles, as well as the use of a new radar station built on solid-state elements. At more than 40 km, the Ukrainian S-125 modernization's engagement area is better than that of the Russian one.

Closely related to leveraging, the ratio is also known as risk, gearing or leverage. The two components are often taken from the firm's balance sheet or statement of financial position (so-called book value), but the ratio may also be calculated using market values for both, if the company's debt and equity are publicly traded, or using a combination of book value for debt and market value for equity financially. Usage Preferred stock can be considered part of debt or equity. Attributing preferred shares to one or the other is partially a subjective decision but will also take into account the specific features of the preferred shares. When used to calculate a company's financial leverage, the debt usually includes only the Long Term Debt (LTD). Quoted ratios can even exclude the current portion of the LTD. The composition of equity and debt and its influence on the value of the firm is much debated and also described in the Modigliani‚ÄìMiller theorem. Financial economists and academic papers will usually refer to all liabilities as debt, and the statement that equity plus liabilities equals assets is therefore an accounting identity (it is, by definition, true). Other definitions of debt to equity may not respect this accounting identity, and should be carefully compared. Generally speaking, a high ratio may indicate that the company is much resourced with (outside) borrowing as compared to funding from shareholders. Formula In a general sense, the ratio is simply debt divided by equity. However, what is classified as debt can differ depending on the interpretation used. Thus, the ratio can take on a number of forms including: *Debt / Equity *Long-term Debt / Equity *Total Liabilities / Equity In a basic sense, Total Debt / Equity is a measure of all of a company's future obligations on the balance sheet relative to equity. However, the ratio can be more discerning as to what is actually a borrowing, as opposed to other types of obligations that might exist on the balance sheet under the liabilities section. For example, often only the liabilities accounts that are actually labelled as \\"debt\\" on the balance sheet are used in the numerator, instead of the broader category of \\"total liabilities\\". In other words, actual borrowings like bank loans and interest-bearing debt securities are used, as opposed to the broadly inclusive category of total liabilities which, in addition to debt-labelled accounts, can include accrual accounts like unearned revenue. Another popular iteration of the ratio is the long-term-debt-to-equity ratio which uses only long-term debt in the numerator instead of total debt or total liabilities. Total debt includes both long-term debt and short-term debt which is made up of actual short-term debt that has actual short-term maturities and also the portion of long-term debt that has become short-term in the current period because it is now nearing maturity. This second classification of short-term debt is carved out of long-term debt and is reclassified as a current liability called current portion of long-term debt (or a similar name). The remaining long-term debt is used in the numerator of the long-term- debt-to-equity ratio. A similar ratio is debt-to-capital (D/C), where capital is the sum of debt and equity: :D/C = total liabilities / total capital = debt / (debt + equity) The relationship between D/E and D/C is: :D/C = D/(D+E) = D/E / (1 + D/E) The debt-to-total assets (D/A) is defined as :D/A = total liabilities / total assets = debt / (debt + equity + non-financial liabilities) It is a problematic measure of leverage, because an increase in non-financial liabilities reduces this ratio. Nevertheless, it is in common use. In the financial industry (particularly banking), a similar concept is equity to total assets (or equity to risk-weighted assets), otherwise known as capital adequacy. Background On a balance sheet, the formal definition is that debt (liabilities) plus equity equals assets, or any equivalent reformulation. Both the formulas below are therefore identical: :A = D + E :E = A ‚Äì D or D = A ‚Äì E. Debt to equity can also be reformulated in terms of assets or debt: :D/E = D /(A ‚Äì D) = (A ‚Äì E) / E. Example General Electric Co. () *Debt / equity: 4.304 (total debt / stockholder equity) (340/79). Note: This is often presented in percentage form, for instance 430.4. *Other equity / shareholder equity: 7.177 (568,303,000/79,180,000) *Equity ratio: 12% (shareholder equity / all equity) (79,180,000/647,483,000) See also *Financial ratio *Debt-to-capital ratio References External links Financial ratios ","title":"Debt-to-equity ratio"},{"id":"1377460","title":"Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)"},{"id":"1377468","text":"Adrian, also spelled Hadrian (born before 637, died 710), was an African scholar in Anglo-Saxon England and the abbot of Saint Peter's and Saint Paul's in Canterbury. He was a noted teacher and commentator of the Bible. Adrian was born between 630 and 637. According to Bede, he was a Berber native of North Africa, and abbot of a monastery near Naples, called Monasterium Niridanum (perhaps a mistake for Nisidanum, as being situated on the island of Nisida). Canterbury He was twice offered the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury, by Pope Vitalian, but modestly declined the appointment. He first recommended that it should be given to Andrew, a monk belonging to a neighbouring monastery ('), who also declined on the plea of advanced years. Then, when the offer was again made to Adrian, he introduced to the pontiff his friend Theodore of Tarsus, who then chanced to be at Rome, and who consented to undertake the charge. Vitalian, however, stipulated that Adrian should accompany the new archbishop to Britain. He gave as his reasons that Adrian, having twice before made a journey into Gaul, knew the road and the mode of travelling. The two set out from Rome on 27 May 668, and proceeding by sea to Marseille, crossed the country to Arles, where they remained with John, the archbishop, till they got passports from Ebroin, who ruled that part of Gaul as Mayor of the Palace, for the minor king Clotaire III. Having then made their way together to the north of France, they parted company, and went severally to reside for the winter, Theodore with Agilbert, bishop of Paris, Adrian first with Emmon, bishop of Sens, and afterwards with Faro, bishop of Meaux. Theodore, being sent for in the following spring by King Ecgberht of Kent, was allowed to take his departure, and he reached England at the end of May 669; but Adrian was detained by order of Ebroin, who is said to have suspected him of being an emissary of the Greek emperor sent to stir up troubles against the kingdom of the Franks. At length, however, the tyrant became convinced that there was no ground for this notion, and Adrian was permitted to proceed to England, where, immediately on his arrival, he was made abbot of the monastery of Saints Peter and Paul (afterwards called Saint Augustine's) at Canterbury, an appointment which was in conformity with instructions given by the pope to Theodore. Such is the account given in the Ecclesiastical History (iv. 1.). Adrian was known to be a man learned in the Bible, as well as in Greek and Latin, and an excellent administrator. Under his direction the abbey came to have substantial, far-reaching influence. In another account, also attributed to Bede, in his Lives of the Abbots of Wearmouth, it is stated that Adrian was not made abbot till after the resignation of Benedict Biscop, who is made to have accompanied Theodore all the way from Rome, and to have been immediately on their arrival appointed to this place, which he appears to have held for about two years. The facts in the two relations are not perhaps absolutely irreconcilable; but they are strangely dissimilar in manner, and in the circumstances which they respectively notice, to have come from the same pen. Bede describes Adrian (or Hadrian, as he calls him in the Ecclesiastical History), as not only a distinguished theologian, but eminently accomplished in secular learning; he and Theodore, we are told, traversing all parts of the island, gathered multitudes of scholars around them wherever they appeared, and employed themselves daily with equal diligence and success in instructing those who flocked to them not only in the truths of religion but in the several branches of science and literature then cultivated. Bede particularly mentions the metrical art, astronomy, and arithmetic (which may be considered as representing what we should now call rhetoric and the belles lettres, physical science, and mathematics); and he adds, that while he wrote (in the early part of the eighth century), there still remained some of the pupils of Theodore and Adrian, who spoke the Greek and Latin languages as readily as their native tongue. A record of the teaching of Theodore and Adrian is preserved in the Leiden Glossary. To the flourishing state of learning thus introduced into England, and for a short time maintained, King Alfred appears to allude in the preface to his translation of Pope Gregory I's Liber Pastoralis Curae, in the latter part of the ninth century, where he says that it often came into his mind what wise men there were in the country, both laymen and ecclesiastics, in a former age; how the clergy in those happy times were diligent both to teach and to study, and how foreigners then came hither to acquire learning and wisdom; whereas now, in his own day, if any Englishman desired to make himself a scholar, he was obliged to go abroad for instruction. Death Adrian, long surviving his friend the archbishop, is said to have lived for 39 years after he came to England, continuing till his death to preside over the monastery at Canterbury. (Bede, Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum iv. 1, 2.; and Vita Abbatum Wiramuth., in Smith's Beda, p. 293.; W. Malmes. De Pontif. p. 340.) He died in 709 and was buried in his monastery. He came to regarded as a saint and his relics were re-deposited in the new monastery on 9 January 1091, which is now his feast day.

The term is also used by antinatalists to pejoratively refer to anyone who has procreated, an act which they consider immoral. The use of \\"breeder\\" in this way is not new. It appears, for example, in Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal, widely acknowledged as the preeminent English satirical essay, in which Swift repeatedly uses the term. Some parents resent being referred to as \\"breeders\\", and feel that the word unduly reduces the process of child-raising to animal husbandry.  Usage in the LGBT community  The term was part of a 2006 controversy in the heavily gay resort town of Provincetown, Massachusetts, when petitioners against same-sex marriage whose identity was published complained of having been called \\"breeders\\". The San Francisco Chronicle described the term as \\"a joking or derogatory slur used by gays to describe heterosexuals\\". While using the term \\"breeder\\" as a descriptive term is not new, the term has increased in use within the last decade mainly due its acceptance by pop culture and specifically youth pop culture. Some heterosexuals have said that the term \\"breeder\\" is offensive to straight people and associated it with \\"heterophobia\\" or degrading heterosexual lifestyles. However, heterosexuals who do not have children can also be referred to as breeders, simply because they are heterosexual. The term \\"breeder\\" has also been used to describe lesbian parents that partake in reproduction. The idea of gay parenting has led some to say that the line between \\"breeders\\" and otherwise is less clear, with the idea of LGBT families beginning to \\"breed\\". The term's connotation is a point of contention within the LGBT community. The expansion of the term to include parents within the community has created a divide on its meaning. There has been debate over its acceptability, inside and outside of LGBT circles, and whether it is a slur.

It is self-funded, largely through listener subscription and fund-raising events; however, it does carry some \\"advertising material\\" (called sponsorship with all community broadcasters in Australia) at a maximum of 5 mins per hour. It broadcasts 24 hours a day, on 92.1 in the FM band. The name RTRFM is a contraction of \\"aRTy Radio\\". An estimated 103,000 listeners over the age of 15 regularly listen to RTRFM (approximately 8% of the 15+ population). The programming on RTRFM is diverse and broad, providing air time for local music, dance music, jazz, electronica, blues, classic rock, metal, indie, GLBTIQ news, current affairs and more.  History  The station that became RTRFM started off at the University of Western Australia. It was started on 1 April 1977, broadcasting with the callsign 6UWA. Shortly afterwards, Murdoch University got involved and the station's callsign was changed to 6UVS. In November 1990, the UWA Senate decided to close down the radio station and transmission was terminated that night. 6UVS was off air for six months while negotiations between the University, volunteers at the station and the Australian Broadcasting Authority were carried out. A public hearing was held and it was determined that Universities Radio Ltd. (a joint company of UWA and Murdoch University) could become Arts Radio Ltd. with the callsign of 6RTR. The station remained based at UWA. Murdoch remained involved through the program Murdoch Magazine (later to become Morning Magazine and now The Mag). In 2005, RTRFM moved from its old home in the Sanders Building at the University of Western Australia to its own premises on Beaufort Street in Mount Lawley, which is where it is located today. In 2017, RTRFM celebrated its fortieth anniversary with an exhibition at the State Library, a birthday celebration Neon Picnic, a donor drive and a concert at the Perth Concert Hall in November.  Programming  RTRFM has a diverse range of programs. Programming consists of 50 different programs which cover a host of issues and music genres including indie rock, indigenous music and current affairs, music of the 1960s and 70s, experimental music, punk and hardcore, dance and electronic music, chill wave and many more. Daily programs include Breakfast with Taylah (hosted by Taylah Strano), Out to Lunch, Full Frequency and Drivetime. The Sunday Morning Coming Down program has a weekly feature album which is given away on the shows to subscribers. A local independent feature album and RTRFM feature album are also chosen to feature across all relevant RTRFM programming.

It is part of the greater Toukola region. The City of Helsinki requires all developers in the Arabianranta area to use 1-2% of the building investments of individual sites for works of art. This rule has been followed since the launching of development in the area 2000. Therefore, works of arts are visible around the district. Artists, designers and craftsmen put their stamp on buildings, objects and a communal spirit that gives energy. The district is mainly divided into three hubs. The H√§meentie Factory District is the heart of the Arabia region where you can find an unbroken tradition of design. At the southern end of Arabia, there is the Toukolanranta (swe. Majstranden), which translates into English as May Beach. The present showcases of functional buildings were constructed in an area that was originally wasteland. Artist Johanna Hyrk√§s has designed an art trail which combines the buildings and the art gardens. The district is easily accessible by bus and trams, it takes around 15 minutes to get to the city centre. History The Swedish King Gustav Vasa founded Helsinki on the mouth of the Vantaa River in 1550. The Annala Gardens on the west side of H√§meentie was founded in the 1820s. One of the most important factories located in this neighbourhood is that of Arabia ceramics. This company was once the biggest ceramics factory in all of Europe. The building complex houses facilities for the Helsinki University of Art and Design as well as an interesting museum which is part of the Helsinki Design Museum. Although many people think that Arabianranta (the coast or shoreline of Arabia) derives its name from the famous Arabia ceramics and glassware factory, the name Arabia or rather ‚ÄúArabian ja Kaanaan maa‚Äù (the land of Arabia and Canaan) is already found in documents dated back to the 18th century whereas the Arabia factory wasn't founded until the 1870s. The modern buildings of Arabiaranta have been built on the principle of art, where 1-2% of construction costs have been dedicated for art. In the Arabia region, the works of art reflect the history, nature and the unique tradition of Finnish design. The price of properties in this district of Helsinki are higher than average in Helsinki due to its proximity to nature and modern infrastructure. Arabianranta's residents have free internet (10Mbit/s) due to the district's comprehensive fiber optic network for residential building in this area. The network has been assembled, so that it is as reliable as electricity, water, heating and all the other basic services Description Arabianranta is a home for 10,000 people, a workplace for 5,000 and a campus for 6,000 students and know-how professionals. As a residential district, Arabianranta is heterogenic, with different types of housing: modern loft buildings, city villas, and the Plus Koti (Plus Home) concept and homes for groups with special needs such as Loppukiri (community housing for active elderly people), K√§pytikka (residence for mentally disabled juvenile) and MS-Talo (MS House) (for people with MS). The Arabianranta district has formed a ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù for housing and since 2007 there has been testing for services and products called \\"Helsinki Living Lab\\" together with the residents. Besides the local information network, one of the most important services for the residents is the housing association‚Äôs own web site, which is being updated by a named moderator from each association. Arabianranta is a home to over 300 enterprises and 4,000 employees. In the field of creative industries, the businesses are normally small or medium-sized enterprises. After the educational institutes, the biggest private sector employers are the Iittala Group and Digia Oyj. The future objective is to attract more and more businesses in the field of creative industries to join the Arabianranta community and operate and develop together with the local educational institutes. The enterprises also find new business partners and customers via the association's web site. The unified campus area of Arabianranta consists of 6 educational institutes, with 6,000 students and about 1,500 know-how professionals. The universities are the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture, Arcada University of Applied Sciences and Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. The upper secondary vocational institutions are Swedish Prakticum and Finnish Heltech. In the Helsinki Pop & jazz Conservatory almost 1,000 students study rhythm music. Educational institutions and students can use and benefit from this platform in their own research projects, one example of this is Helsinki Living Lab project sponsored by TEKES. =Art and Design= Cor-huset The Art and Design City Helsinki Ltd was founded to manage the project and its role became to develop the information network structure and Helsinki Virtual Village services, also the basis for this particular site. ‚ÄúArt and Design‚Äù (unique artworks) can be seen in the built environment, in buildings, public yards and premises. The arts and culture are actively introduced to people of Arabianranta by educational institutes such as the performance art of Metropolia, The University of Art and Design and Helsinki Pop & Jazz Conservatory. The educational institutes offer The Masters of Arts Festival, which has become the biggest single event in the area. A park named after the designer Tapio Wirkkala is in the centre of Arabianranta. The park, which was opened in 2012, was designed by the American theatre director and artist Robert Wilson. Advanced and modern projects and experiments in apartment building design and business operations are typical for the Arabia district. =Facilities= Arabia Museum The Arabia Museum is part of the Design Museum, Helsinki, with a comprehensive overview of the products and rich history of the Arabia factory. The gallery houses temporary exhibitions. Museum of Technology The Museum of Technology is situated on the historic Kuninkaankartanonsaari and it is the only museum that is specialized in general technology in Finland. The Museum of Technology is located on the premises of the former water works. The museum stores, studies and explains through the medium of seasonal exhibitions the story of the diverse techniques, innovations and developments of industrial production in Finland as well as their impact on society and people's daily lives. The Power Station Museum The Power Station Museum is situated on the west bank of the Old Town Rapids and includes the former turbine pumping station, water works and steam power station. The Power Station Museum still produces so- called environmental penny power for urban use. Together the Power Station Museum and the Museum of Technology form a unique historical industrial surrounding.

The Asian Tigers also inspired other economies later on; the Anatolian Tigers (certain cities in Turkey) in the 1980s, the Gulf Tiger (Dubai) in the 1990s, the Celtic Tiger (Republic of Ireland) in 1995‚Äì2000, the Baltic tigers (Baltic states) in 2000‚Äì2007, and the Tatra Tiger (Slovakia) in 2002‚Äì2007.See this essay by Michal Hvoreck√Ω for an example of the term applied to Slovakia - The End of the Economic Miracle In the 1960s, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Myanmar were billed as the next East Asian Tiger Economies as all three countries were experiencing high growth. Internal issues however led to the economies of all three countries to falter. Israel's rapid economic growth in the 1990s, and again in the 2000s and 2010s following a brief recession, earned it a reputation as a tiger economy, and the term \\"Hebrew tiger\\" was dubbed in one newspaper.Jones, Clive and Murphy, Emma: Israel: Challenges to Identity, Democracy, and the State, p. 3 Bangladesh has been described as an emerging \\"Asian tiger\\" in recent years due to its high economic growth and industralisation which bear many similarities to the way the Four Asian Tigers industralised between the 1960s and 1990s. Similar In Latin America, the fast-growing & emerging economies, oriented to free trade and free market development are called the Pacific Pumas of which consist of Mexico, Chile, Peru & Colombia. For emerging economies in Africa, the term lion economy is used as an analogy. Countries considered to be \\"lion economies\\" are South Africa, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Botswana, Egypt, Mauritius, and Tunisia.

Together with some surrounding unpopulated small islands, Lauttasaari is also a district of Helsinki. With 23,226 residents as of 2017, the island is Finland's second largest by population, after Fasta √Öland. Its land area is 3.85 km. Lauttasaari is primarily a residential area but also contains services, including several marinas and canoe clubs. Although close to the city centre, Lauttasaari has not been entirely built up. Notably, almost the entire shoreline remains in public use, with footpaths, beaches, playgrounds, patches of forest, and rocky outcrops. The name Lauttasaari literally means \\"ferry island\\", although nowadays, the island is connected to the rest of Helsinki and to the city of Espoo by bridges, causeways, and the Helsinki metro, which has two stations in the district. The island has two postal codes: 00200 and 00210. 300px  History  Mutteri caf√© in Lauttasaari. Lauttasaari was a largely undeveloped part of the municipality of Huopalahti (Hoplax), which was annexed to the city of Helsinki on 1 January 1946.  Transportation  = Public transport =  Metro  The Helsinki metro has two stations in the district, the Lauttasaari and the Koivusaari stations. The Lauttasaari metro station is served by two entrances: one in the Lauttis shopping centre, and one on Gyldenintie.  Bus  All the internal bus routes ‚Äî 20, 21, and 21B ‚Äî connect with at least one of the metro stations, and the routes 20 and 21 continue to the city centre. The bus routes 115A and 555 start at the centre of the island. Route 115A runs via Tapiola to Mankkaa in Espoo, and route 555 runs via Espoo to Martinlaakso in the city of Vantaa. Lauttasaari is also served by night bus routes 20N and 112N from the city centre. = Car = The L√§nsiv√§yl√§ motorway that links central Helsinki with Espoo passes through Lauttasaari, and has two interchanges on the island.  Lauttasaarentie and Lauttis  Lauttasaarentie is the main thoroughfare in Lauttasaari, home to many residents, and the location of the shopping mall Lauttis, which also serves as one of the entrances to the Lauttasaari metro station. The shopping mall is the commercial centre of the island, and near its geographical centre.  Subdistricts  The district of Lauttasaari is divided into four subdistricts. = Koivusaari = The subdistrict of Koivusaari is a separate island, separated from Lauttasaari by a narrow channel. It had no residents as of 2017. Its postal code is 00200. The Koivusaari metro station was built in anticipation of extending the island by land fill and constructing residential buildings on it. = Kotkavuori = The subdistrict of Kotkavuori comprises the northeastern part of the island, nearest Helsinki city centre. The housing is mainly apartment buildings. The subdistrict has one of the two main hills of the island, where the iconic Lauttasaari water tower was located in 1958‚Äì2015. Kotkavuori had 8,117 residents as of 2017. Its postal code is 00200. = Myllykallio = The subdistrict of Myllykallio comprises the western part of the island. The housing is mainly apartment buildings. The subdistrict has one of the two main hills of the island. The area of Katajaharju is the part of Myllykallio on the north side of L√§nsiv√§yl√§ motorway. The housing is mainly private residential houses. Myllykallio had 7,066 residents as of 2017. Its postal code is 00200. = Vattuniemi = The subdistrict of Vattuniemi comprises the southern part of the island. The area was built up in the 1950s as an industrial zone. Since 2000, there has been a significant change in the makeup of the area, and several office and industrial facilities have been demolished, with apartments being built to replace them. Currently, the median price of residential property is relatively high, causing the residential makeup to consist of the young and affluent. The main streets are S√§rkiniementie on the western side of the area, and Vattuniemenkatu on the eastern side. Vattuniemi had 8,043 residents as of 2017. Its postal code is 00210.  Public buildings  The Lauttasaari church, the Myllykallio school, and the old Management Studies Institute building are amongst the examples of 1950s construction for public spaces on the island. The church was inaugurated in 1958, and was designed by professor Keijo Pet√§j√§, who himself was a resident of Lauttasaari. The church steeple was placed into service in the autumn of 1957.

Directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese, the cartoon is the first in Jones' \\"hunting trilogy\\"‚Äîthe other two cartoons following it being Rabbit Seasoning and Duck! Rabbit, Duck! It is also the first cartoon to feature a feud between Bugs and Daffy. Produced by Edward Selzer for Warner Bros. Cartoons, Inc., the short was released to theaters on May 19, 1951 by Warner Bros. Pictures and is often considered among Jones' best and most important films. The film marks a significant shift in Daffy's personality, going from being the insane \\"screwball\\" character who (like Bugs) overwhelmed his adversaries, to being a much more flawed individual, full of greed and vanity and desiring for attention under the spotlight. This personality change, which was previously explored by Jones in You Were Never Duckier and Daffy Dilly, and even earlier in Friz Freleng's You Ought to Be in Pictures, was done in order for Daffy to better serve as Bugs' foil. This was fueled by Bugs' popularity surpassing Daffy's quickly over the years, increasing the desire of the studio's animators to pair the two together. However, Daffy was returned to his original screwball personality in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Looney Tunes: Back in Action (in which Daffy got both personalities), Daffy's Rhapsody, New Looney Tunes, and Looney Tunes Cartoons. Plot Daffy Duck lures Elmer Fudd to Bugs Bunny's burrow with fake rabbit footprints, calls down to the rabbit that a \\"friend\\" is here to see him, then watches from behind a tree as Elmer shoots at the emerged Bugs - parting his ears. As Elmer prepares to shoot again, Bugs informs him that it is not rabbit season, but rather duck season. Daffy storms out, irate, and attempts to convince Elmer that Bugs is lying. Their conversation breaks down into Bugs engaging Daffy in a verbal play, which results in Daffy saying it is duck season. Once he says this, he tells Elmer to fire, which he does. After Daffy's beak spins back into place, he tries the verbal game again, this time starting first. It ends the same way. When Daffy is shot for the third time, he walks away, his head now upside down. Elmer goes to shoot him, but it appears the gun is out of bullets. Bugs relays this apparent fact to Daffy and, thrilled, Daffy comes back. He grabs Elmer's gun to make sure, only to be shot with the last bullet. Daffy then sees a sign that Bugs has nailed to a tree saying, \\"Duck Season Open\\". As he sees Elmer approaching, he disguises himself as Bugs, and reminds him that it is duck season. Bugs then appears, disguised as Daffy, complete with webbed feet and fake bill, and asks Daffy why he thinks it is duck season. Daffy points at the tree; however, Bugs has switched the sign to \\"Rabbit Season Open\\". Elmer, of course, shoots Daffy. After Daffy gets blasted, the two shed their costumes as Daffy rants to Bugs how despicable he is. Ignoring Daffy, Bugs then begins to read duck recipes from a cookbook that he pulls from his rabbit hole, and Daffy does the same with a rabbit recipe cookbook that he also pulls from the hole. Elmer tells them that he is a vegetarian and only hunts for the sport of it (although, in previous appearances, it has been stated that he was hunting Bugs for rabbit stew or the like). Outraged, Bugs gets in Elmer's face and claims there are other sports besides hunting. When Daffy then offers to play tennis, Elmer blasts him again, tells Bugs that he is next, and then begins shooting and chases both of them all the way to the rabbit hole, into which both Daffy and Bugs jump. Bugs comes out to accuse Elmer of hunting rabbits with an elephant gun, suggesting that Elmer shoot an elephant instead. Just as Elmer considers it, a huge elephant appears from behind him, threatens him in a Joe Besser voice, and preemptively pounds him into the ground before striding off. Elmer finally loses patience and decides to take out both Bugs and Daffy. Daffy comes into the scene, disguised as a hunting dog and Bugs comes in as a lady hunter. Elmer is smitten by \\"lady\\" Bugs until \\"dog\\" Daffy bites Elmer on the ankle, causing him to scream. Elmer then recognizes both of them after one of Bugs' ears pops out from under his disguise and decides to finally finish them both off. Daffy and Bugs dash to a tree, where they begin alternately tearing off an endless row of \\"Rabbit Season\\" and \\"Duck Season\\" signs, until they hit a final one proclaiming it to be \\"Elmer Season\\". They both then turn to Elmer with devious grins on their faces. The tables having now turned, Elmer gets a taste of his own medicine and starts running, avoiding gunshots whilst Bugs and Daffy, dressed as hunters, stalk him. Voice cast *Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elephant *Arthur Q. Bryan as Elmer Fudd (uncredited) Reaction Rabbit Fire is generally considered among Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese's best works, and is noted for its use of dialogue gags in lieu of the physical gags more typical in animation. Besides the two sequels to this film, a number of other Jones shorts, including Beanstalk Bunny and Ali Baba Bunny, paired quick-witted Bugs and self-serving Daffy with (or rather against) each other. It is also worth noting that in this episode, Mel Blanc showcased his ability to make one character imitate another character's voice, in this case, Daffy Duck impersonating Bugs Bunny and vice versa. Actor and voice actor Hank Azaria pointed out that as a voice actor, it is almost impossible to accomplish. At one point, he tried to do that in The Simpsons, along with the other cast members, but none of them could do it. The \\"rabbit season/duck season\\" argument from this short became one of the references in the Looney Tunes franchise to have been analyzed both by scholars and by Jones himself (although this gag was actually used by Daffy against Porky six years earlier in the cartoon Duck Soup to Nuts). According to an essay by Darragh O'Donoghue, Rabbit Fire \\"stands in close relation to human experience, striving and generally failing to grasp an elusive quarry or goal.\\"Darragh O'Donoghue's review of What's Opera, Doc?, Rabbit Fire, and Feline Frameup. sensesofcinema.com Richard Thompson said that in the film, there is \\"the clearest definition of character roles: Elmer never knows what's going on; Bugs always knows what's going on and is in control of things; Daffy is bright enough to understand how to be in control, but never quite makes it.\\" Jones himself refers to Rabbit Fire as a \\"corner\\" picture, among his works that, \\"as in turning a corner in a strange city, reveal new and enchanting vistas.\\" The short earned an honorable mention for animation historian Jerry Beck's list of The Fifty Greatest Cartoons: As Selected by 1000 Animation Professionals. Its 1952 sequel, Rabbit Seasoning, made the actual list at number 30. The style, setup, and plot of Rabbit Fire were adapted into the opening sequence of Warner Bros.' 2003 film Looney Tunes: Back in Action. The non sequitur elephant character based on Joe Besser was the inspiration for Horatio the Elephant, a recurring character on PBS' Sesame Street. The Elephant from The Major Lied 'Til Dawn reappeared, but redesigned. Production details * In two interviews conducted years after this cartoon was first released, director Chuck Jones fondly recalled voice artist Mel Blanc improvising hilariously as Daffy when he was trying to think of another word besides \\"despicable\\". However, in the finished film, only the words from the original dialogue script actually appear. Historians believe that Blanc did indeed improvise, as Jones remembered, but then Jones had decided instead to use what was originally written.\\"You're Despicable!\\" ‚Äì michaelbarrier.com. Retrieved 2008-01-16. * Rabbit Fire and its two sequels often have two characters in the same frame for some length of time ‚Äî an atypical aspect of the \\"Hunting\\" trilogy. In order to keep budgets under control, most Warner Bros. cartoons would cut back and forth between characters, rather than put two or more in the same shot. Or, at least, both characters might be in the same shot, but only one would actually be animated.Michael Barrier's audio commentary for Disc One of Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1 (2005). * Although the film is introduced by the Looney Tunes music The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down, the opening card indicates a Merrie Melodies \\"Blue Ribbon\\" release from 1960, and the end card is Merrie Melodies, replacing the original orange-red Looney Tunes title sequences. * It marked the first cartoon where Bugs and Daffy starred and appeared together. While Bugs had made a cameo in Porky Pig's Feat (which co-starred Daffy and Porky Pig), this was the first where both were the stars. * Although this is the first cartoon with Daffy's selfish side replacing his screwball side, he still hollers \\"hoo-hoo\\", catchphrase from his screwball personality.

It is considered a capital expenditure when the asset is newly purchased or when money is used towards extending the useful life of an existing asset, such as repairing the roof. Capital expenditures contrast with operating expenses (opex), which are ongoing expenses that are inherent to the operation of the asset. Opex includes items like electricity or cleaning. The difference between opex and capex may not be immediately obvious for some expenses; for instance, repaving the parking lot may be thought of inherent to the operation of a shopping mall. The dividing line for items like these is that the expense is considered capex if the financial benefit of the expenditure extends beyond the current fiscal year. Usage Capital expenditures are the funds used to acquire or upgrade a company's fixed assets, such as expenditures towards property, plant, or equipment (PP&E;). In the case when a capital expenditure constitutes a major financial decision for a company, the expenditure must be formalized at an annual shareholders meeting or a special meeting of the Board of Directors. In accounting, a capital expenditure is added to an asset account, thus increasing the asset's basis (the cost or value of an asset adjusted for tax purposes). Capex is commonly found on the cash flow statement under \\"Investment in Plant, Property, and Equipment\\" or something similar in the Investing subsection. Accounting rules For tax purposes, capex is a cost that cannot be deducted in the year in which it is paid or incurred and must be capitalized. The general rule is that if the acquired property's useful life is longer than the taxable year, then the cost must be capitalized. The capital expenditure costs are then amortized or depreciated over the life of the asset in question. Further to the above, capex creates or adds basis to the asset or property, which once adjusted, will determine tax liability in the event of sale or transfer. In the US, Internal Revenue Code ¬ß¬ß263 and 263A deal extensively with capitalization requirements and exceptions.Donaldson, Samuel A. Federal Income Taxation Of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials (2nd ed.). St. Paul: Thomson West, 2007. pg. 173 Included in capital expenditures are amounts spent on: # acquiring fixed, and in some cases, intangible assets # repairing an existing asset so as to improve its useful life # upgrading an existing asset if it results in a superior fixture # preparing an asset to be used in business # restoring property or adapting it to a new or different use # starting or acquiring a new business An ongoing question for the accounting of any company is whether certain costs incurred should be capitalized or expensed. Costs which are expensed in a particular month simply appear on the financial statement as a cost incurred that month. Costs that are capitalized, however, are amortized or depreciated over multiple years. Capitalized expenditures show up on the balance sheet. Most ordinary business costs are either expensable or capitalizable, but some costs could be treated either way, according to the preference of the company. Capitalized interest if applicable is also spread out over the life of the asset. Sometimes an organization needs to apply for a line of credit to build another asset, it can capitalize the related interest cost. Accounting Rules spreads out a couple of stipulations for capitalizing interest cost. Organizations can possibly capitalize the interest given that they are building the asset themselves; they can't capitalize interest on an advance to buy the asset or pay another person to develop it. Organizations can just perceive interest cost as they acquire costs to develop the asset. The counterpart of capital expenditure is operating expense or operational cost (opex).

American actor. He is best known for having played characters of handsome, narcissistic young men, most notably Dorian Gray in the film The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945). Early life Hatfield was born in New York City to William Henry Hatfield (died 1954), an attorney who served as deputy attorney general for New York, and his wife, Adele (n√©e McGuire). He was educated at Columbia University, then moved to London, England where he studied drama and began acting in theatre. Acting career He returned to America for his film debut in Dragon Seed (1944), in which he and his co-stars (Katharine Hepburn, Akim Tamiroff, Aline MacMahon, Turhan Bey) portrayed Chinese peasants, some more convincingly than others. Hatfield's second film, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945), made him a star. As Oscar Wilde's ageless anti-hero, Hatfield received widespread acclaim for his dark good looks as much as for his acting ability. However, the actor was ambivalent about the role and his performance. \\"The film didn't make me popular in Hollywood,\\" he commented later. \\"It was too odd, too avant-garde, too ahead of its time. The decadence, the hints of bisexuality and so on, made me a leper! Nobody knew I had a sense of humour, and people wouldn't even have lunch with me.\\" His follow-up films, The Diary of a Chambermaid (1946), The Beginning or the End (1947), and The Unsuspected (1947), were successful, but Joan of Arc (1948) was a critical and financial failure. Hatfield's film career began to lose momentum very quickly in the 1950s, and he returned to the stage. His subsequent movies included supporting roles in The Left Handed Gun (1958), King of Kings (as Pontius Pilate) (1961), El Cid (1961), Harlow (1965) (as Paul Bern), and The Boston Strangler (1968). He cut back on performing in the 1970s. His later movies included King David (1985) and Her Alibi (1989). He appeared frequently on television and received an Emmy Award nomination for the Hallmark Hall of Fame videotaped play The Invincible Mr. Disraeli (1963). In 1957, he appeared in Beyond This Place, directed by Sidney Lumet. Hatfield's other television credits include three guest appearances on Murder, She Wrote opposite his Picture of Dorian Gray costar Angela Lansbury, who had become a lifelong friend, and who had a home in County Cork. He also appeared as the villain in the second episode of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, titled \\"The City Beneath the Sea\\". He appeared in Alfred Hitchcock Presents in \\"None Are So Blind\\", which first aired October 28, 1956. In 1952, Hatfield appeared as Joseph in Westinghouse Studio One's The Nativity. This was a rare commercial network staging of a 14th-century mystery play, adapted from the York and Chester plays. In 1966, he appeared on the television series The Wild Wild West in an episode titled \\"The Night of the Man-Eating House\\". In a twist on his Dorian role, his character starts as an old man who, upon entering a house inhabited by the ghost of his mother, is turned back into a youthful Confederate soldier. A second appearance in the third season episode \\"The Night of the Undead\\" had him portray the vengeful and mad Dr. Articulus. According to the magazine Films in Review, Hatfield was ambivalent about having played Dorian Gray, feeling that it had typecast him. \\"You know, I was never a great beauty in Gray...and I never understood why I got the part and have spent my career regretting it\\", he is reported to have said. Personal life and death Having been introduced to Ireland by actress and former co-star Angela Lansbury, Hatfield lived at Ballinterry House, Rathcormac, County Cork from the early 1970s. He purchased the structure to save it from demolition and he spent 24 years restoring and renovating it. A keen collector of antiques and art, he referred to Ballinterry House as a painting which he never would finish. He died in his sleep of a heart attack at a friend's home, aged 81, after celebrating Christmas dinner. Hatfield never married. His long-time close friend and colleague Maggie Williams was heir of both Ballinterry House and his collection. She maintained the historic Irish country home exactly as it was at the time of Hatfield's death. The house was sold in late 2006, and the entire contents of the Hurd Hatfield Collection were sold at an auction on the premises by Country House Antique & Fine Art Auction in March 2007. At the time of his death, Hatfield was writing his autobiography. He was cremated, and his ashes scattered. Hatfield was a Democrat, supporting Adlai Stevenson's campaign during the 1952 presidential election.Motion Picture and Television Magazine, November 1952, page 33, Ideal Publishers He performed several times in the Soviet Union and developed a deep interest in Russian culture and religion. His interest ran so deep that on his deathbed, a Russian Orthodox priest attended him and officiated at his funeral.

The magnitude of the minority interest in the subsidiary company is generally less than 50% of outstanding shares, or the corporation would generally cease to be a subsidiary of the parent.http://www.groco.com/readingroom/bus_dloc_mid.aspx. The Minority Interest Discount It is, however, possible (such as through special voting rights) for a controlling interest requiring consolidation to be achieved without exceeding 50% ownership, depending on the accounting standards being employed. Minority interest belongs to other investors and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet of the owning company to reflect the claim on assets belonging to other, non-controlling shareholders. Also, minority interest is reported on the consolidated income statement as a share of profit belonging to minority shareholders. The reporting of 'minority interest' is a consequence of the requirement by accounting standards to 'fully' consolidate partly owned subsidiaries. Full consolidation, as opposed to partial consolidation, results in financial statements that are constructed as if the parent corporation fully owns these partly owned subsidiaries; except for two line items that reflect partial ownership of subsidiaries: net income to common shareholders and common equity. The two minority interest line items are the net difference between what would have been the common equity and net income to common, if all subsidiaries were fully owned, and the actual ownership of the group. All the other line items in the financial statements assume a fictitious 100% ownership. Some investors have expressed concern that the minority interest line items cause significant uncertainty for the assessment of value, leverage and liquidity.http://eumedion.nl/en/public/knowledgenetwork/position- papers/position_paper_full_consolidation_of_partly_owned_subsidiaries_requires_additional_disclosure.pdf. Position paper by corporate governance forum 'Eumedion' A key concern of investors is that they cannot be sure what part of the reported cash position is owned by a 100% subsidiary and what part is owned by a 51% subsidiary. Minority interest is an integral part of the enterprise value of a company. The converse concept is an associate company. Accounting treatment Under the International Financial Reporting Standards, the non-controlling interest is reported in accordance with IFRS 5 and is shown at the very bottom of the Equity section on the consolidated balance sheet and subsequently on the statement of changes in equity. Under US GAAP minority interest can be reported either in the liabilities section, the equity section or, preceding changes to acceptable accounting standards, the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The mezzanine section is located between liabilities and equity. FASB FAS 160 and FAS 141r significantly alter the way a parent company accounts for non-controlling interest (NCI) in a subsidiary. It is no longer acceptable to report minority interest in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet.

It has several tourist sites, including a \\"drive-in\\" volcano, the Diamond Botanical Gardens with waterfall (briefly featured in Superman II) and historic mineral baths, plus the nearby beaches of Anse Chastanet to the north and Malgretout to the south. The nearby plantation at Anse Mamin, formerly Malmaison, was at one time owned by Gaspard-Joseph Tascher de La Pagerie father of Josephine de Beauharnais. Although the exact locale of her birth has been the subject of dispute by historians -notable figures such as Henry H Breen, Mayor of Castries and Mme. Darlas Delomel, her childhood friend claim she was born in St Lucia, then baptized at five weeks in Martinique- it is certain that the Empress spent much of her childhood on her father's plantation.

He became well known due to a long stint as a panelist on The McLaughlin Group. Kondracke worked for several major publications, serving for twenty years as executive editor and columnist for the non-partisan Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. He was also co-host of The Beltway Boys of Fox News Channel and was a regular nightly contributor to Special Report with Brit Hume and Special Report with Bret Baier. Professional career Kondracke was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Genevieve Marta (n√©e Abrams) and Matthew Kondracke. His father was of Polish descent, while his maternal grandfather was from a Jewish family. Kondracke graduated from Joliet Township High School in 1956, and from Dartmouth College in 1960. While at Dartmouth, he majored in English and was president of The Dartmouth newspaper. Kondracke was a board member of the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine and served as his class secretary. Later he received the Daniel Webster Award for Public Service from the Dartmouth Club of Washington. After college, Kondracke joined the U.S. Army and served in Washington, DC in the Counter Intelligence Corps while pursuing graduate work at Georgetown University and working part-time for the Washington Star newspaper. After quitting the Army in 1963, Kondracke joined the staff of the Chicago Sun- Times, transferring to the paper's Washington bureau in 1968, eventually becoming White House correspondent in 1974. In that role, his name was on the master list of Nixon political opponents. He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1973‚Äì74. Kondracke left the Sun-Times in 1977 to become executive editor of the news magazine The New Republic. He worked there until 1985, when he left to become Washington bureau chief for Newsweek magazine. In the meantime, his increased profile led to commentary positions at National Public Radio, This Week with David Brinkley and The Wall Street Journal. In 1982, he joined The McLaughlin Group as one of the original panelists, a position he held for 16 years. Moderator John McLaughlin consistently teased him by pronouncing his name \\"more-TAHN\\", emphasizing the second syllable, and when guest panelist Mortimer Zuckerman appeared with Kondracke on the show as he did several times, McLaughlin would claim to be \\"MORT-ified\\". In 1984, he was a panelist for the second televised debate (on foreign policy) between President Ronald Reagan and Democratic challenger Walter Mondale. In 1991, Kondracke began serving as executive editor of Roll Call, retiring in 2011. During this time he wrote a twice-weekly column in Roll Call (\\"Pennsylvania Avenue\\") that was syndicated by Newspaper Enterprise Association, part of United Media. After stepping down as executive editor he remained with Roll Call as contributing editor. In October 1998, Kondracke began co-hosting his own television series, The Beltway Boys, with Fred Barnes, on the Fox News Channel. He was also a regular nightly contributor to Special Report with Brit Hume on the same network. In 2010, he became the main interviewer for the Jack Kemp Foundation's Oral History Project, performing more than 100 interviews with teammates, colleagues, staff members and family of the late Representative, presidential and vice-presidential candidate and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Kondracke held the Jack Kemp Chair in Political Economy in the John W. Kluge Center at the Library of Congress from September 2011 to June 2012, where he researched and wrote about \\"the late Jack Kemp's congressional career, his leadership role during the Reagan Era, his presidential campaign and his influence on the Republican Party and the nation\\". In the 1996 science fiction film Independence Day, Kondracke appears at the beginning of the movie on The McLaughlin Group, speaking about the ineffectual leadership of President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and saying, \\"Leadership as a pilot in the Gulf War has no relationship to political leadership. It's a different animal.\\" Kondracke also appeared in the 1993 film Dave. For his correct prediction of the Democratic takeover of Congress he won The Washington Post‚Äôs Crystal Ball Tournament of Champions Award in 2006. Kondracke appeared on C-SPAN in July 2017, calling for a revival of the \\"political center\\" in America.Mort Kondracke on the Current Political Climate: Morton Kondracke talks about his recent RealClearPolitics column in which he calls for a revival of the ‚Ä≥political center‚Ä≥ in America Personal life In 1967, Kondracke married Millicent Martinez, a half Jewish, half Mexican liberal activist. They had two daughters, movie-maker Alexandra and medical doctor Andrea. Kondracke struggled with alcoholism during the 1980s, and he credits Millicent for helping him end his addiction by 1987. In 1988, Millicent was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Her long struggle with the disease caused Kondracke to become an advocate for Parkinson's disease research and for increased government spending on medical research. Millicent Kondracke grew increasingly incapacitated by the disease and died on July 22, 2004. Kondracke detailed his family's struggle with Parkinson's in a 2001 book called Saving Milly: Love, Politics, and Parkinson's Disease (). The book was the basis of a CBS television movie called Saving Milly, starring Madeleine Stowe and Bruce Greenwood, which was broadcast on March 13, 2005.

Early life Born Dixie Wanda Hendrix in Jacksonville, Florida, Hendrix was performing in her local amateur theater when she was seen by a talent agent who signed her to a Hollywood contract. Career and marriages She made her first film, Confidential Agent, in 1945 at the age of 16 and for the first few years of her career was consistently cast in \\"B\\" pictures. By the late 1940s, she was being included in more prestigious films, such as Ride the Pink Horse (1947) and Miss Tatlock's Millions (1948). She starred with Tyrone Power in Prince of Foxes (1949). In 1946, Audie Murphy saw Hendrix on the cover of Coronet magazine and arranged to meet her. The two were married on February 8, 1949, making the film Sierra (1950) together, but the marriage was short-lived; they divorced on April 14, 1950. Hendrix later said that Murphy had wanted her to give up her career, but more significantly, he was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder from his service in World War II and during \\"flashback\\" episodes he would turn on her, once holding her at gunpoint. In her later years, Hendrix spoke of Murphy's condition with sympathy. Hendrix resumed her career, but found it difficult to obtain good roles. On June 26, 1954, she married wealthy sportsman James Langford Stack, Jr., the brother of actor Robert Stack, and essentially retired from films, though she worked in live television dramatic anthology shows such as Pulitzer Prize Playhouse, Robert Montgomery Presents, The Plymouth Playhouse, The Ford Television Theatre, The Revlon Mirror Theater, and Schlitz Playhouse, and occasionally appeared in later series such as Bat Masterson, My Three Sons, Wagon Train and Bewitched. The couple divorced on November 3, 1958. She married Italian financier and oil company executive Steven LaMonte (born 14 August 1942) on June 7, 1969. They divorced on November 17, 1980. Death She died in 1981, in Burbank, California from pleural pneumonia at the age of 52, and was interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery.

This is the most widely distributed shrew in North America, where it is also known as the common shrew.  Description  It is grey-brown in colour with a light grey underside and a pointed snout. It has a long tail that is brown on top and pale underneath with a dark tip. Its body is about 9 cm in length including a 4 cm long tail. It weighs about 5 g. It has darker colouring than other shrews. Masked shrews can live up to two years, but, on average, only survive eighteen months. In a long-term study done in Alaska, Yom-Tov and colleagues (2005) found that the masked shrew's body size contradicts Bergmann's Rule. The study, done on 650 specimens and spanning from 1950 to 2003, examined body size in relation to ambient temperature. Measurements of body weight and the length of the tail, ear, hind foot, and body were taken. Results yielded that the masked shrew's body size decreased with high latitudes and with lower mean January temperatures, a trend that opposed Bergmann's Rule. It was suggested that this may be a coping mechanism to limit total energy requirements due to decreased food availability in winter months. Additionally, it was shown that body and tail length increased with rising temperatures during the second half of the twentieth century. This may be due to higher temperatures increasing the availability of the shrew's main diet.  Distribution  The masked shrew is the most widely distributed shrew (Merritt 1995). Its range covers most of northern North America extending south as far down to Maryland, along the Rocky Mountains in the west, and to the Appalachians in the east. This species was introduced into Newfoundland in the late 1950s. It can be found in many types of habitat like arid grasslands, moist areas, woodland, and tundra. The masked shrew mostly lives in humid areas and with high levels of vegetation to hide in. Moisture determines the abundance of this shrew.  Predation and parasitism  Predators include larger shrews, hawks, owls, shrikes, snakes, herons, foxes, leopard frogs, bluebirds, brown trouts, and weasels. Masked shrews are susceptible to many types of parasites, like fleas and tapeworms (Cowan 2007). Cowan and colleagues (2007) found that the high volume of food masked shrews consume causes them to be more susceptible to parasitism. Since males have larger ranges, they have a higher exposure to parasites (Cowan 2007). Diet and prey Masked shrews are opportunistic generalists. They eat insects, worms, snails, small rodents, salamanders, and seeds. Due to its high metabolism, the masked shrew can eat three times its weight a day (Whitaker 2004). The shrew has to eat almost constantly, because they can only survive a few hours without food (Whitaker 2004). Their metabolism drops when they are at rest. McCay and colleagues (1997) found a higher abundance of masked shrews in non-irrigated forests due to a higher availability of larval insects, which is the preferred food source of the masked shrew. Masked shrews chose Lepidoptera larva over other food sources (McCay 1997).  Behavior  This animal is active day and night year-round. Masked shrews can be nocturnal or diurnal depending on the weather. Doucet and colleagues (1974) showed that rain increases the nocturnal activity of the masked shrew, while cloud cover increases day and night activity. It digs tunnels but also uses tunnels created by other small mammals. It uses dry grass to make nests in these tunnels. It can make high frequency pulses and has lateral scent glands. The home range of the masked shrew depends on availability of food, but it is on average 0.55 hectare. It has a low tolerance for other shrews in its home range. Merritt and colleagues (1995) found that its mass declined by half from summer to winter and non-shivering heat production, energy conservation, and reduced body mass. Reproduction A litter of four newborn masked shrews. Masked shrews living at high latitudes are born in late spring and summer, reach adult size by the time they leave their nests, and complete their life cycle within a year (Yom-Tov 2005). They are born during spring or summer, remain immature in winter, and breed the following spring (Merritt 1995). Masked shrews breed from May to September. Females have one litter of 6 to 7 young during the breeding season. The young are born hairless and clawless and have translucent abdominal walls (Whitaker 2004). Body mass increases and peaks at twenty days, then decreases when the young leave the nest after about 27 days. Masked shrews have a high chance of mortality during their first two months of life and most die during the first year. Masked shrews become sexually mature at two months, but wait until their first spring to breed. References Cowan, K. M., Shutler, D., Herman, T. B., & Stewart, D. T. (2007).

The term is broad and refers to many different kinds of systems. The one common theme that unites all knowledge based systems is an attempt to represent knowledge explicitly and a reasoning system that allows it to derive new knowledge. Thus, a knowledge-based system has two distinguishing features: a knowledge base and an inference engine. The first part, the knowledge base, represents facts about the world, often in some form of subsumption ontology (rather than implicitly embedded in procedural code, in the way a conventional computer program does). Other common approaches in addition to a subsumption ontology include frames, conceptual graphs, and logical assertions. The second part, the inference engine, allows new knowledge to be inferred. Most commonly, it can take the form of IF-THEN rules coupled with forward or backward chaining approaches. Other approaches include the use of automated theorem provers, logic programming, blackboard systems, and term rewriting systems such as CHR (Constraint Handling Rules). These more formal approaches are covered in detail in the Wikipedia article on knowledge representation and reasoning. Overview Knowledge-based systems were first developed by artificial intelligence researchers. These early knowledge-based systems were primarily expert systems ‚Äì in fact, the term is often used interchangeably with expert systems, although there is a difference. The difference is in the view taken to describe the system: * \\"expert system\\" refers to the type of task the system is trying to assist with ‚Äì to replace or aid a human expert in a complex task typically viewed as requiring expert knowledge * \\"knowledge-based system\\" refers to the architecture of the system ‚Äì that it represents knowledge explicitly, rather than as procedural code. While the earliest knowledge-based systems were almost all expert systems, the same tools and architectures can and have since been used for a whole host of other types of systems. Virtually all expert systems are knowledge-based systems, but many knowledge-based systems are not expert systems. The first knowledge-based systems were rule based expert systems. One of the most famous was Mycin, a program for medical diagnosis. These early expert systems represented facts about the world as simple assertions in a flat database, and used rules to reason about (and as a result add to) these assertions. Representing knowledge explicitly via rules had several advantages: # Acquisition and maintenance. Using rules meant that domain experts could often define and maintain the rules themselves rather than via a programmer. # Explanation. Representing knowledge explicitly allowed systems to reason about how they came to a conclusion and use this information to explain results to users. For example, to follow the chain of inferences that led to a diagnosis and use these facts to explain the diagnosis. # Reasoning. Decoupling the knowledge from the processing of that knowledge enabled general purpose inference engines to be developed. These systems could develop conclusions that followed from a data set that the initial developers may not have even been aware of. Later architectures for knowledge-based reasoning, such as the BB1 blackboard architecture (a blackboard system), allowed the reasoning process itself to be affected by new inferences, providing meta-level reasoning. BB1 allowed the problem-solving process itself to be monitored. Different kinds of problem- solving (e.g., top-down, bottom-up, and opportunistic problem-solving) could be selectively mixed based on the current state of problem solving. Essentially, the problem-solver was being used both to solve a domain-level problem along with its own control problem, which could depend on the former. Other examples of knowledge-based system architectures supporting meta-level reasoning are MRS and SOAR. In addition to expert systems, other applications of knowledge-based systems include real-time process control, intelligent tutoring systems, and problem-solvers for specific domains such as protein structure analysis, construction-site layout, and computer system fault diagnosis. As knowledge-based systems became more complex, the techniques used to represent the knowledge base became more sophisticated and included logic, term-rewriting systems, conceptual graphs, and frames. Consider frames as an example. Rather than representing facts as assertions about data, the knowledge-base has become more structured. Frames can be thought of as representing world knowledge using analogous techniques to object-oriented programming, specifically the use of hierarchies of classes and subclasses, relations between classes, and behavior of objects. As the knowledge base became more structured, reasoning could occur both by independent rules, logical inference, and by interactions within the knowledge base itself. For example, procedures stored as daemons on objects could fire and could replicate the chaining behavior of rules. Another advancement was the development of special purpose automated reasoning systems called classifiers. Rather than statically declare the subsumption relations in a knowledge-base, a classifier allows the developer to simply declare facts about the world and let the classifier deduce the relations. In this way a classifier also can play the role of an inference engine. The most recent advancement of knowledge-based systems has been to adopt the technologies, especially a kind of logic called description logic, for the development of systems that use the internet. The internet often has to deal with complex, unstructured data that cannot be relied on to fit a specific data model. The technology of knowledge- based systems, and especially the ability to classify objects on demand, is ideal for such systems. The model for these kinds of knowledge-based Internet systems is known as the Semantic Web.

NS 93 train on an elevated portion of the line 5 of the Santiago Metro. Two Wuppertal Schwebebahn trains meet above the street An elevated railway (also known as an El train or simply an El for short) is a rapid transit railway with the tracks above street level on a viaduct or other elevated structure (usually constructed from steel, cast iron, concrete, or bricks). The railway may be broad-gauge, standard-gauge or narrow-gauge railway, light rail, monorail, or a suspension railway. Elevated railways are normally found in urban areas where there would otherwise be multiple level crossings. Usually, the tracks of elevated railways that run on steel viaducts can be seen from street level. History The earliest elevated railway was the London and Greenwich Railway on a brick viaduct of 878 arches, built between 1836 and 1838. The first of the London and Blackwall Railway (1840) was also built on a viaduct. During the 1840s there were other plans for elevated railways in London that never came to fruition.Jack Simmons and Gordon Biddle, The Oxford Companion to British Railway History, Oxford University Press, (1997), p.360. From the late 1860s onward elevated railways became popular in US cities. The New York West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway operated with cable cars from 1868 to 1870, thereafter locomotive-hauled. This was followed by the Manhattan Railway in 1875, the South Side Elevated Railroad, Chicago (1892‚Äì), and the elevated lines of the Boston Elevated Railway (1901‚Äì). The Chicago transit system itself is known as \\"L\\", short for \\"elevated\\". The Berlin Stadtbahn (1882) and the Vienna Stadtbahn (1898) are also mainly elevated. The first electric elevated railway was the Liverpool Overhead Railway, which operated through Liverpool docks from 1893 until 1956. In London, the Docklands Light Railway is a modern elevated railway that opened in 1987 and, since, has expanded.\\"DLR History Timeline\\". Transport for London.

Many maglev railways are also elevated. =Suspension railways= H-Bahn Dortmund, a monorail suspension people mover During the 1890s there was some interest in suspension railways, particularly in Germany, with the Schwebebahn Dresden, (1891‚Äì) and the Wuppertal Schwebebahn (1901). H-Bahn suspension railways were built in Dortmund and D√ºsseldorf airport, 1975. The Memphis Suspension Railway opened in 1982. Suspension railways are usually monorail; Shonan Monorail and Chiba Urban Monorail in Japan, despite their names, are suspension railways. =People mover systems= People mover or automated people mover (APM) is a type of driverless grade-separated, mass-transit system. The term is generally used only to describe systems that serve as loops or feeder systems, but is sometimes applied to considerably more complex automated systems. Similar to monorails, Bombardier Innovia APM technology uses only one rail to guide the vehicle along the guideway.

The studio is owned by The Walt Disney Studios and was opened in May 1998. It is one of the three film studios in Australia, the others being Village Roadshow Studios and Docklands Studios Melbourne. Occupying a 32-acre-site, and 15 minutes from the Sydney CBD, the movie studio features eight sound stages, several production offices, workshops and around 60 independent entertainment industry businesses. The studio has been involved in the production of a number of blockbusters, including The Matrix, Moulin Rouge!, Mission: Impossible 2, Star Wars Episodes II and III, and Superman Returns. Site history Prior to 1998, the Studio's site was host to Sydney's Royal Easter Show ‚Äì the largest event held in Australia, and the sixth largest in the world. In 1881, the New South Wales Government provided land for the Royal Agricultural Society at Moore Park where the show was held for 116 years. From 1902 to 1919, the site expanded to the south and from 1920 to 1937, the Moore Park Showground expanded to the north. In 1998, the Show moved to a new showground and the former Sydney Showground at Moore Park became the home to Fox Studios Australia. Features The area includes southern hemisphere's largest sound stage. The history of the site provides an eclectic mix of new and old buildings, and landscapes. Located twenty minutes by foot from the Sydney city centre, the 132,000 square metre (32 acre) site includes eight stages, production offices and heavy industrial workshops, and a community of over 60 independent businesses. These businesses provide services such as equipment hire, travel and freight, casting, postproduction, and explosives/pyrotechnic factory, adjoining residential properties. Fox Lighting is Australia's leading supplier for major motion film lighting. Fox Studios Australia houses post-production specialists in film editing, sound re-recording and sound. Walking distance away is Trackdown's 100 seat orchestral recording soundstage based at the neighbouring Entertainment Quarter. Fox Studios Australia also has several facilities; including shops, cinemas, cafes, restaurants, parks, major sporting facilities and entertainment venues. Fox Studios Australia catering facilities opened in the area in 1998. Backlot Theme Park Fox Studios Backlot was purportedly based on Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal Studios Florida, and Disney's Hollywood Studios. The $261 million park opened on 7 November 1999. An adjacent precinct provides restaurants and cafes, a retail complex, parklands, entertainment venues, and sporting facilities. The adjacent precinct was previously known as simply 'Fox Studios Entertainment Precinct'. The backlot closed down in 2001. Ownership Fox Studios Australia is owned by the media conglomerate The Walt Disney Company, under the terms of a 99-year lease from the New South Wales State Government. The decision by the Carr Government in 1995 to allow News Corporation, predecessor of 21st Century Fox, to take over the site was controversial and attracted criticism from sections of the media such as The Sydney Morning Herald and independent MP Clover Moore. It was alleged that a secret deal took place between the NSW Government and the largest shareholder and Chairman/CEO of News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch, involving the donation of $25 million in taxpayers' money for the new site. On 20 March 2019, The Walt Disney Company completed its acquisition of 21st Century Fox, and now owns the studio, as well as 20th Century Fox and other studios.

Background  The Talamasca Caste (or Order of the Talamasca or simply Talamasca) is described as a secret society set up to watch over and keep track of the paranormal, in particular, witches, spirits, werewolves and vampires. Rice describes them as \\"psychic detectives\\". In the novel Prince Lestat it is revealed to the vampire Pandora and Arjun that the founder of the Talamasca is the spirit Pandora had encountered upon the death of Cassiodorus. The spirit is named Gremt Stryker Knollys and was touched by what Pandora had said to him upon their first meeting. This touched him to create the Talamasca in the year 748 along with the Vampire who created Marius and another ghost who was the spirit of a just killed Vampire named Hesketh. Some information of the origins of the Talamasca is mentioned by David Talbot in the book Merrick, where it is written: \\"A humming sound distracted me somewhat, because I was afraid that it came from bees. I have a very great fear of bees, and like many members of the Talamasca, I fear some secret regarding bees which has to do with our origins, but there is not room enough to explain here.\\" This can earlier be connected to the being that Pandora meets in the book Pandora, where in the ending Pandora meets a being described to have come to exist in the following way: \\"Thus force rose out of the very bees themselves, out of their intricate knowledge and their countless sublime patterns, as though they had somehow accidentally evolved it, or empowered it with consciousness through the means of their endless creativity, meticoulousness and endurance.\\" This force is then transferred to a scarecrow. Pandora speaks some about the century that this happened as follows: \\"Once in the sixth Century - that is, five hundred years after the birth of Christ and three hundred years since I had left Marius\\" Through this we can make out that this being came to life 500 years after Christ's birth; thereby, the Talamascan was created sometime after this. The word Talamasca comes from Latin meaning \\"animal mask\\". It was also an old term to describe a witch or a shaman. The Talamasca's motto is: \\"We watch. And we are always there.\\" (Queen of the Damned, Witching Hour, and The Vampire Companion) The Talamasca itself was described in Rice's novels as having \\"motherhouses\\" or bases in London, Amsterdam, Rome and other various parts of the world. The organization is said to have existed since the 1st Century (Rice states in 'The Witching Hour' that it was formally formed in the 11th Century, but existed before that). The organization itself was described as having many influences in the suppression of paranormal information, namely the existence of vampires as is the case with Lestat, hoarding most of his diaries and other expository items that may have revealed the existence and nature of vampires in its vaults below the main motherhouse in London, England. Beneath the building are a number of museums in which the Talamasca house a substantial collection of artifacts, all connected with the supernatural in some way. Vaults accessible only by the eldest members of the order house paraphernalia connected with vampires. The Talamasca also housed several paintings of Marius's \\"The Temptation of Amadeo\\", and other artifacts from vampires such as Pandora, Armand, Louis, Lestat de Lioncourt, and Claudia. The organization is also responsible for the suppression and cover-up regarding the Mayfair family's fiasco concerning the Taltos birth anomaly. It may also have been responsible for covering the burning of the Th√©√¢tre des Vampires. Many vampiric characters from Rice's novels once belonged to the Talamasca before accepting the \\"dark gift\\". Jesse Reeves, David and Merrick Mayfair, are the most popular of Rice's ex-Talamasca characters. The Talamasca Order also appear in Anne Rice's The Lives of the Mayfair Witches, the Mayfair Witches trilogy. The Talamasca has become the focus of several websites and role-playing games, as have many of Rice's characters. A similar secret society appears in the Highlander: The Series and Buffy the Vampire Slayer - the Watchers' Council or Watchers - an ancient organization based in Great Britain and with much the same principles: to track and observe immortals.

Oximes are drugs known for their ability to reverse the binding of organophosphorus compounds to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). AChE is an enzyme that removes acetylcholine from the synapse after it creates the required stimulation on the next nerve cell. If it gets inhibited, acetylcholine is not removed after the stimulation and multiple stimulations are made, resulting in muscle contractions and paralysis. Organophosphates (such as nerve gases) are well-known inhibitors of AChE. They bind to a specific place on the enzyme and prevent it from functioning normally by changing the OH group on the serine residue and by protonating (quaternary nitrogen, R4N+) the nearby nitrogen atom located in the histidine residue. Function Oximes such as obidoxime, pralidoxime and asoxime (HI-6) are used to restore enzyme functionality. They have greater affinity for the organic phosphate residue than the enzyme and they remove the phosphate group, restore the OH to serine and turn nitrogen from histidine back into its R3N form (tertiary nitrogen). This results in full enzyme recovery and the phosphate- oxime compound is eliminated from the organism via urine. Obidoxime is more potent than pralidoxime and diacetyl-monoxime. Side effects Oximes like these do have side effects and they include liver damage, kidney damage, nausea, vomiting, but they are very efficient antidotes to nerve gas poisoning. Usually treatment of poisoning includes the use of atropine, which can slow down the action of the poison, giving more time to apply the oxime.

The shock had a moment magnitude of 8.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). It resulted in 165‚Äì173 casualties and over $26 million in damage. The seafloor along the fault was elevated, triggering a Pacific-wide tsunami with multiple destructive waves at heights ranging from 45‚Äì130 ft. The tsunami obliterated the Scotch Cap Lighthouse on Unimak Island, Alaska among others, and killed all five lighthouse keepers. Despite the destruction to the Aleutian Island Unimak, the tsunami had almost an imperceptible effect on the Alaskan mainland. Waves reportedly traveled across the ocean at 500 miles an hour and measured 55 feet high, crest to trough, according to the USGS. The wave reached Kauai, Hawaii 4.5 hours after the quake, and Hilo, Hawaii 4.9 hours later. In Hilo, the death toll was high: 173 were killed, 163 injured, 488 buildings were demolished and 936 more were damaged. Witnesses told of waves inundating streets, homes, and storefronts. Many victims were swept out to sea by receding water. The tsunami caused much damage in Maui as well. Waves there demolished 77 homes and many other buildings.https://www.civilbeat.org/2011/03/9558-a-history-of-tsunamis-in- hawaii/ The residents of these islands were caught off-guard by the onset of the tsunami due to the inability to transmit warnings from the destroyed posts at Scotch Cap, and the tsunami is known as the April Fools' Day Tsunami in Hawaii because it happened on April 1 and many thought it to be an April Fool's Day prank. The effects of the tsunami also reached Washington, Oregon, and California. The tsunami was unusually powerful for the size of the earthquake. The event was classified as a tsunami earthquake due to the discrepancy between the size of the tsunami and the relatively low surface wave magnitude. The large-scale destruction prompted the creation of the Seismic Sea Wave Warning System, which became the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in 1949.

Fipke is credited as a co-discoverer of the mine, and retained a 10% interest until 2014, which made him a very wealthy man. Charles Edgar \\"Chuck\\" Fipke (born 1946) is a Canadian geologist and prospector who discovered the existence of diamonds around Lac de Gras in Canada's Northwest Territories. He is now a multimillionaire involved in geological explorations around the world. Fipke is also a prominent owner and breeder in North American thoroughbred horse racing. Background Charles E. Fipke Centre for Innovative Research at University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus. Fipke was born in Edmonton, Alberta. Growing up, he was sometimes assumed to be stupid because of his \\"frantic stop-start mind\\". His nicknames include Captain Chaos and Stumpy. He occasionally stammers and is known for his use of the word \\"hey\\" at the end of sentences. In 1970, he graduated from University of British Columbia (UBC) with a bachelor of science degree in geology. Fipke received an honorary doctorate from Okanagan University College in 1998. In 2006, Fipke donated to UBC to support the creation of the Charles Fipke Centre for Innovative Research. In 2012, the Fipke Laboratory for Trace Element Research (FiLTER) opened, with Fipke funding the purchase of imaging equipment including a scanning electron microscope. \\"To graduate excellent scientists, a university needs to have the best technology available,\\" said Fipke. \\"My goal is to help UBC's Okanagan campus reach the leading edges of science, in order to recruit the top students and faculty from around the world.\\" Fipke has also donated substantially to Alzheimer's research at UBC. Fipke was divorced by his wife Marlene in 2000, who had been with him since he began searching for the diamonds. At the time, the divorce settlement was the largest in Canadian history, with her portion of the assets estimated to be approximately . Career  Upon graduation, Fipke worked for companies such as Kennecott Copper and Cominco, performing mineral explorations in locations such as Papua New Guinea, South Africa and Brazil. He became an expert in the study of indicator minerals to identify potential strikes, the key to his later success. \\"Everyone now knows that G-10 garnets with low calcium might lead you to diamonds, hey,\\" he said in 2011. \\"But how do you distinguish between a group 1 eclogitic garnet that grew with a diamond and a group 2 eclogitic garnet that didn't? They look the same.\\" Fipke uses custom software to help determine the difference. \\"No one else out there can distinguish between these similar tiny particles of minerals that grow with a diamond and ones that don't.\\" In 1977, Fipke founded CF Mineral Research, a heavy mineral and diamond exploration research laboratory. In 1983, he founded Dia Met Minerals, which became listed on the Vancouver Stock Exchange in 1984. Dia Met was sold to BHP Billiton in 2001. In 1988, Fipke and partner Stu Blusson began a systematic search for diamonds in the Northwest Territories, leading to the discovery of the first diamond pipe in North America in November 1991 near Lac de Gras. The Ekati Diamond Mine is now located there. Fipke maintained a 10% interest in Ekati until 2014, when he sold his share to Dominion Diamond Corp. for . \\"I'm not really a miner,\\" he said. \\"I'm an exploration geologist. This sale gives me more ability to do exploration.\\" Fipke is currently involved in multiple greenfield projects, involving searches for diamonds in Ontario with Metalex Ventures, for gold in the Yukon, Nevada and Yemen with Cantex Mine Development and for uranium along the Manitoba‚ÄìSaskatchewan border with Northern Uranium. Horse racing  Fipke bought his first thoroughbred racehorse in 1981 and has subsequently become a significant owner and breeder.

History Inside of the ASICS store on Newbury Street, in the Back Bay section of Boston ASICS in Vaughan Mills An ASICS shop on Albion Street, Leeds ASICS Ltd. began as Onitsuka Co., Ltd on September 1, 1949. Its founder, Kihachiro Onitsuka, began manufacturing basketball shoes in his home town of Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. Soon after the range of sports activities widened to a variety of Olympic styles used throughout the '50s, '60s and '70s by athletes worldwide. Onitsuka became particularly renowned for the Mexico 66Mexico 66, Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66, Onitsuka Mexico 66  Tiger Central design, in which the distinctive crossed stripes, now synonymous with the company brand, were featured for the first time. Martial arts star Bruce Lee was the first known celebrity to popularize this design. In 1977, Onitsuka Tiger merged with GTO and JELENK to form ASICS Corporation. Despite the name change, a vintage range of ASICS shoes are still produced and sold internationally under the Onitsuka Tiger label. In its 2006 fiscal year, ASICS generated 171 billion yen in net sales and 13 billion yen in net income. Sixty-six percent of the company's income came from the sale of sports shoes, 24% from sportswear, and 10% from sports equipment. Forty-nine percent of the company's sales were in Japan, 28% in North America, and 19% in Europe. On July 12, 2010, ASICS bought the Swedish outdoor brand Hagl√∂fs, for SEK1,000,000,000 ($128.7 million). On October 4, 2011, it was announced that ASICS would be the new official kit manufacturer for the Australian Cricket Team, replacing German manufacturer Adidas. Relationship with Nike Nike, Inc., originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports, was founded to sell Onitsuka Tiger shoes in the US. When Phil Knight visited Japan in 1963 shortly after he graduated from Stanford University, he was impressed by Onitsuka Tiger shoes with their high quality but reasonable prices. He immediately visited the Onitsuka Tiger office and asked to be their sales agent in the USA. After a number of years, their relationship crumbled and both companies sued each other, with Nike retaining the naming rights to several shoes.

At Disneyland, this is particularly true during the 4:00pm to 8:00pm dinner rush. Reservations one week in advance are advisable, but are able to be made up to two months in advance for the entire dining period. The restaurant is built within the same show building that houses part of the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction, with parts of the ride even taking place beneath the restaurant. Although seated in a large, enclosed building, diners experience the illusion of eating in an outdoor restaurant at nighttime. This effect is achieved through the use of a dark and distant ceiling, air conditioning, and carefully coordinated lighting. The theming is intensified by the sounds of crickets and frogs, the meandering glow of fireflies, and projection effects above that imitate the night sky. The restaurant is also popular for offering a view of the beginning portion of Pirates of the Caribbean.

The only complete surviving figure of a larger arrangement of figures. This is the earliest three dimensional representation of the bull leap. It is assumed that thin gold pins were used to suspend the figure over a bull. Bull-leaping (, The name of a ritual bull-fight held on occasion of a festival in Thessaly (scholion to Pindar, Pythian Odes 2.78), at Smyrna (CIG 3212) and at Sinope (CIG 4157).) is a form of non-violent bull fighting based on an ancient ritual involving an acrobat leaping over the back of a charging bull (or cow). The sport survives in modern France, usually with cows rather than bulls, as ; in Spain, with bulls, as and in Tamil Nadu, India with bulls as Jallikattu. Ritual leaping over bulls is a motif of Middle Bronze Age figurative art, notably of Minoan Crete, but also found in Hittite Anatolia, the Levant, Bactria and the Indus Valley.One argument for the association of Minoan Crete with the Bronze Age culture of the Indus Valley by H. Mode (Indische Fr√ºhkulturen und ihre Beziehungen zum Westen, Basel, 1944); since the 1940s, further bull-leaping motives have been discovered in 2nd millennium BC contexts in Bactria and northern Anatolia. It is often interpreted as a depiction of a rite performed in connection with bull worship. Iconography Bull-leaping scene in H√ºseyindede vases belongs to Early Hittites, approximately 1650 BC. Younger (1995) classifies bull-leaping depictions as follows: * Type I: the acrobat approaches the bull from the front, grabs the horns, and somersaults backwards * Type II: the acrobat approaches the bull from the front, dives over the horns without touching them and pushes himself with his hands from the bull's back into a backward somersault * Type III: the acrobat is depicted in mid-air over the bull's back, facing the same way as the animal The Type III depictions are often found in Late Minoan IIIB artwork (14th to 13th centuries BC). Frescoes in Tell el-Dab'a (Avaris, Egypt) dating to the 18th dynasty (16th to 14th centuries BC) show similar designs besides genuinely Egyptian motifs, for which reason they have usually been ascribed to Minoan-taught Egyptian craftsmen (rather than to Minoan ones directly). They could also have been included as palace decorations because the palace was built for an Aegean princess diplomatically married to a Hyksos pharaoh.Rohl, David, The Lords of Avaris, Random House, 2007. Other examples of bull-leaping scenes have been found in Syria, such as a cylinder seal impression found in level VII at Alalakh (Old Babylonian period, 19th or 18th century BC) showing two acrobats performing handstands on the back of a bull, with an ankh sign placed between them, another seal belonging to a servant of Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1800 BC), besides other Syrian examples. Furthermore, a relief vase was discovered in H√ºseyindede in 1997, dating to the Hittite Old Kingdom (18th to 15th centuries BC). Minoan Crete The Minoan Bull-leaper sculpture at the British Museum. Bull-leaping is thought to have been a key ritual in the religion of the Minoan civilization in Bronze Age Crete. As in the case of other Mediterranean civilizations, the bull was the subject of veneration and worship. Representation of the Bull at the palace of Knossos is a widespread symbol in the art and decoration of this archaeological site. The assumption, widely debated by scholars, is that the iconography represents a ritual sport and/or performance in which human athletesboth male and femaleliterally vaulted over bulls as part of a ceremonial rite. This ritual is hypothesized to have consisted of an acrobatic leap over a bull, such that when the leaper grasped the bull's horns, the bull would violently jerk its neck upwards, giving the leaper the momentum necessary to perform somersaults and other acrobatic tricks or stunts. Barbara Olsen, associate professor of Greek and Roman Studies at Vassar College, adds that the sport was probably not especially dangerous for participants. \\"From the images it looks like they [leaped over the bulls] successfully‚Äîthe Minoans tend not to give us too much violent imagery, so the bull-leaping usually ends pretty well.\\" Contemporary bull-leaping Francisco de Goya. A youth trying to take control of a bull in jallikattu at Alanganallur. A \\"leaper\\" in 2006 Bull-leaping is still practiced in southwestern France, where it is traditionally known as the , although usually aggressive cows are used instead of bulls. They are the female stock of the fighting bulls bred for the in Spain. However, once per year bulls are used, in the Festival of Art and Courage. The town of Mont-de- Marsan in Gascony is renowned for its fine or 'leapers' and ('dodgers') dressed in brocaded waistcoats. They compete in teams, attempting to use their repertoire evasions and acrobatic leaps to avoid the cow's charges. The cow is typically guided by the use of a long rope attached to its horns, so that it runs directly at the performers and is restrained from trampling or goring them should they miss a trick. Although there is little to no risk to the cow in this form of contest, it is a highly dangerous sport for the human participants; a prominent one from Montois, Jean-Pierre Rachou, was killed in 2001 when he fell on his head after being hit by a cow. The are held from March to October on the occasion of festivals in many cities and villages, including Nogaro, Mont-de-Marsan, Dax, Castelnau-d'Auzan, and many other places. There are also national championships. Bull-leaping is also practised in Tamil Nadu state of India by the Tamil people, and is called jallikattu, sallikkattu, eru thazhuvuthal and manju virattu. It is a traditional spectacle in which a bull, such as the Pulikulam or Kangayam breeds, is released into a crowd of people, and multiple human participants attempt to grab the large hump on the bull's back with both arms and hang on to it while the bull attempts to escape. Participants hold the hump for as long as possible, attempting to bring the bull to a stop. In some cases, participants must ride long enough to remove flags on the bull's horns. Jallikattu is typically practised in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu as a part of Pongal celebrations on Mattu Pongal day, which occurs annually in January. As there were incidents of injury and death associated with the sport, both to the participants and to the animals forced into it, animal rights organizations have called for a ban to the sport, resulting in the court banning it several times over the past years. However, with protest from the people against the ban, a new ordinance was made in 2017 to continue the sport. A similar but even more dangerous tradition of non-violent bull-leaping, , is practiced in some parts of Spain. Specialists (bullfighters), known as , compete at dodging and leaping over bulls without the use of the cape or sword. Some use a long pole to literally pole-vault over the charging animal, which is both larger than the type used in the French sport, and unrestrained by any guiding rope or similar safety device.

It is an important traffic junction located both on the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway line and at the Tauern Autobahn, a major highway route crossing the main chain of the Alps. Geography Bischofshofen is situated within the Northern Limestone Alps, in the valley of the Salzach river, about south of the state capital Salzburg. It is surrounded by the Hochk√∂nig massif in the west, part of the Berchtesgaden Alps, the Tennen Mountains in the northeast, and the Salzburg Slate Alps in the southeast. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of Bischofshofen proper, Buchberg, Haidberg, and Winkl. =Villages in Bischofshofen and population= * Alpfahrt - 149 * Bischofshofen - 7.134 * Buchberg - 440 * Gainfeld - 109 * Haidberg - 98 * Kreuzberg - 263 * Laideregg - 488 * Mitterbergh√ºtten - 1.323 * Winkl - 83 * Asten - 50 History St Maximilian's Church In Neolithic times local Celtic tribes mined copper and salt in the nearby hills. Later, the Celts were conquered by or assimilated into the expanding Roman Empire, when the area was incorporated into the Noricum province. In the 3rd/4th century, a Roman road led from the Salzach valley to Radstadt on the Enns river. In the 8th century, Bavarian tribes settled the region, promoted by the Agilolfing dukes and Bishop Rupert of Salzburg. The Pongau (pongowe) area was first mentioned in a 711 deed, when a monastery (Cella Maximiliana) was founded through the graces of the Salzburg archbishops and a noble family from Oberalm. Slavic tribes later destroyed this monastery. The village of Hoven itself first appeared in 1151. In the 12th century, the Archbishop of Salzburg gifted the present-day St. Maxmillian's church with the gold- and gem-encrusted relic St. Rubert's crucifix.Czerniewicz-Umer, et al.

It declined through the turbulent 16th century with its natural disasters, economic decline and religious warfare, culminating in the German Peasants' War of 1525‚Äì26. More than two thirds of the local population were expelled during the Counter-Reformation measures instigated by Prince-archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian from 1731 onwards. Many of the Salzburg Protestants found a new home in East Prussia. Finally Bischofshofen re-emerged as a railway hub with the building of the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway line in the late 19th century.Visit Salzburg. http://www.visit-salzburg.net/surroundings/bischofshofen.htm It was elevated to the status of a market town in 1900 and received town privileges on 24 September 2000.

Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Brooks products are available in 60 countries worldwide. It is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. Brooks, founded in 1914, originally manufactured shoes for a broad range of sports. \\"White hot\\" in the mid-70s, the company faltered in the latter part of the decade, and filed for bankruptcy protection in 1981. In 2001, the product line was cut by more than 50% to focus the brand solely on running, and its concentration on performance technology was increased. Brooks Running became the top selling brand in the specialty running shoe market in 2011, and remained so through 2017 with a 25% market share. Brooks shoes have been named \\"Best Running Shoe\\" by publications including Runner's World and Sports Illustrated. The company has been recognized for environmental sustainability programs and technical innovation. History =Early history: Founding, Bruxshu Gymnasium Shoes, Carmen Manufacturing= 1920 ad for Bruxshu Gymnasium Shoes Brooks Sports, Inc. was founded in 1914 by John Brooks Goldenberg, following his purchase of the Quaker Shoe Company, a manufacturer of bathing shoes and ballet slippers. Based in Philadelphia, it operated as a partnership between John Goldenberg and his brothers, Michael and Frank. By 1920, Quaker Shoes had been renamed Brooks Shoe Manufacturing Co., Inc., and its shoes were sold under the brand name Bruxshu. In addition to bathing shoes and ballet slippers, it sold a gymnasium shoe, Ironclad Gyms. The company's innovations included the 1938 introduction of orthopedic shoes for children, Pedicraft, and rubber brakes for roller skates (then known as \\"quick stops\\"), patented in 1944. In 1938, the Goldenbergs bought the Carmen Shoe Manufacturing Company in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Until 1957 a better grade leather was purchased, cut, stitched and fit in Philadelphia, while the same procedure in Hanover used lower grade materials. Both shoes were sold in Philadelphia under the Brooks name, and ranged from inexpensive to high- priced. In 1956, after a series of operational changes, John notified his brother that he would not renew their partnership agreement, and Michael discussed expanding Carmen with his nephew, Frank's son Barton. In 1957, following the dissolution of the partnership, the existence of Brooks Shoe Manufacturing Company was terminated, and Michael and Barton each acquired 50% of Carmen. In 1958, Michael purchased Barton's interest in the company, and as the sole owner, he renamed Carmen the Brooks Manufacturing Company. =1970s: Introduction of EVA, the Vantage, Runner's World #1 running shoe= In 1975, Brooks worked with elite runners, including Marty Liquori, a former Olympian, to design a running shoe. The collaboration produced the Villanova, Brook's first high-performance running shoe. It was the first running shoe to use EVA, an air-infused foam that was quickly adopted by other athletic brands. Brooks followed the Villanova with the Vantage, a running shoe constructed with a wedge to address overpronation. In 1977, based on newly developed measurements of cushioning, flexibility, and durability, the Vantage was ranked at #1 in the annual Runner's World running guide. Runners embraced Brooks' technology, and the demand \\"exploded.\\" Towards the end of the decade Brooks was among the top three selling brands in the US. The Vanguard was another running shoe which appeared in this decade. =1980s: Bankruptcy, the Chariot, Brooks for Women= In 1980, as a result of production issues with Brooks' manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico, defective shoes began to arrive at sporting goods stores. Nearly 30 percent of the shoes were returned, and Brooks scrapped 50,000 pairs. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and was purchased at auction by footwear manufacturer Wolverine World Wide in 1981. In 1982, stability became the top priority for runners, and Brooks introduced the Chariot, a medial post shoe that featured an angled wedge of harder-density foam in the midsole. Thicker on the inside of the shoe and tapered toward the outside, the Chariot represented a ‚Äúsea change‚Äù in running-shoe design. In 1987, with Brooks for Women, it launched an anatomically adjusted line of shoes designed for women. =1990s: The Beast, Adrenaline, ownership changes, apparel, Run Happy= Brooks Adrenaline GTS 18 In 1992, Brooks launched the Beast, a motion control shoe that integrated diagonal rollbar technology. In 1994, the Adrenaline GTS‚Äîan abbreviation for go-to shoe‚Äîwas released. With a firmer midsole density, the Adrenaline GTS was built on a semi-curve, an accommodation for runners with a high arch and wide forefoot. The Beast became a best seller, and the Adrenaline GTS went on to become one of the best- selling running shoes of all time. Wolverine moved Brooks away from the niche running market to a generalist athletic brand. The \\"class to mass\\" strategy was unsuccessful, and Brooks was sold to Norwegian private equity company The Rokke Group for $21 million in 1993. Brooks moved to Rokke's Seattle location following its acquisition. In 1998, Rokke sold a majority interest in Brooks to J.H. Whitney & Co., a Connecticut private equity firm. Brooks introduced a full-line of technical running and fitness apparel for women and men in the spring of 1997. It also expanded into the walking category with the introduction of performance walking shoes. Brooks' Run Happy tag line first appeared in print advertising in 1999. Rather than depicting running as a grueling pursuit, as competitive brands did, Run Happy was based on the idea that runners love running, and suggested that Brooks products allowed \\"runners to have the running experience they were looking for.\\" =2000s: Jim Weber, Berkshire Hathaway, BioMoGo= In 2001, Jim Weber, a former Brooks board member, was named president and CEO of the company. At the time, the company's market share was low, and bankruptcy had again become a concern. Weber cut lower-priced footwear from the Brooks product line, added an on-site lab and staff engineers, and focused the company on technical-performance running shoes. As the brand was rebuilt, its annual revenue fell to $20 million. Three years later, it was $69 million. Brooks was acquired by Russell Athletic in 2004. In 2006, Russell was purchased by Fruit of the Loom and Brooks became a subsidiary of Fruit of the Loom's parent company, Berkshire Hathaway. It became an independent subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway in 2011. In the mid-2000s, Brooks introduced High Performance Green Rubber, a material it developed for outsoles that used sand rather than petrolium. It subsequently developed BioMoGo, the first biodegradable mid-sole for running shoes. It used a non-toxic, natural additive that increased the rate of biodegradation by encouraging microbes in the soil to break the material down into nutrients that could be used by plants and animals, biodegrading approximately 20 times faster than traditional soles. By using BioMoGo, Brooks estimated that it would cut more than 30 million pounds of landfill waste over a 20-year period. The BioMoGo technology was open source. =2010s: DNA, $500 million milestone, Brooks Heritage, 2017 awards, FitStation = Brooks DNA (and later Super DNA) was released in 2013. It provided customized cushioning, and adapted to the user's gender, weight and pace. Engineered from non-Newtonian liquid, it was another of Brooks' technological \\"firsts.\\" In 2011, Brooks became the leading running shoe in the specialty market. On its 100-year anniversary, with a 29% market share, Brooks revenue hit $500 million. Weber stated that based on the company's year-over-year growth, investments from Berkshire Hathaway and the support of its CEO, Warren Buffett, Brooks would become a billion dollar brand. The Brooks Heritage Collection was launched in 2016, returning the Vanguard, the Chariot, and the Beast to the market. Only the technology was updated; the details of the original shoes, including the colorways, were replicated. Brooks introduced the first customized performance running shoe based on personal biomechanics in the United States in December 2017. An instore station that combines 3D foot scanning with gait analysis and pressure mapping, it was developed in partnership with HP and Superfeet. In 2017, Brooks shoes were named Best Running Shoe (The Glycerine and the Launch, Sports Illustrated); Editor's Top Choice (The Adrenaline GTS 18, Runner's World); and Ten Best Running Shoes (The Levitate, Men's Fitness). Sustainability and social responsibility Brooks Running has implemented environmentally conscious practices into their business and manufacturing practices. Several models of their shoes have High Performance Rubber Green (HPR Green) outsoles that are made with sand instead of petroleum. The company says that it uses recycled materials to make other parts of their shoes ‚Äúwhenever possible,‚Äù including laces, fabrics, hangtags and packaging. In 2014, the company partnered with Bluesign Technologies (stylized as bluesign technologies) to evaluate, manage, and eliminate priority chemicals used in the process of manufacturing apparel. Manufacturers that become Bluesign system partners are required to establish management systems for improving resource productivity, consumer safety, water emissions, air emissions, and occupational health and safety. Brooks is also a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, a global trade organization that works to reduce the environmental and social impact of apparel and footwear products. With the some collections, Brooks offers vegan products. Built in 2014, the Brooks headquarters meet the environmental standards of Seattle's Deep Green Pilot Program. The building captures and reuses at least 50 percent of storm water on the site and uses 75 percent less energy than a typical commercial building in the city. As of 2016, it was \\"one of the greenest buildings in the world.\\" Brooks provides paid time annually to employees to volunteer for community organizations. Among other causes, Brooks employees have supported ConservationNEXT's Seattle Backyard Collective, Habitat for Humanity, Northwest Harvest, the Seattle Ronald McDonald House and the 2018 Special Olympic Games. \\"Run B'Cause\\" product donation grants are given annually to organizations who support a \\"healthier, Run Happier world.\\" It was announced in June 2017 that Brooks Running would partner with the 2018 Special Olympics USA Games to create limited-edition co-branded running shoes and apparel, with a portion of the proceeds benefiting the games, and provide free running shoes to athletes participating in the Special Olympics Healthy Athletes Fit Feet program, which offers athletes free podiatric screenings.

The pistol was produced strictly for military use and was introduced into service with the Italian Armed Forces and security forces as the Modello 1951 (M1951), replacing the Modello 1934 pistol, chambered for the 9√ó17mm Short (.380 ACP) cartridge.Wo≈∫niak, Ryszard. Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej - tom 3 M-P. Bellona. 2002. pp106-107. History The pistol was Beretta's first locked- breech design on the market (previous Beretta semi-automatic pistols, were all blowback-operated) and was in limited production circa 1953 and in full-scale production in 1956 until 1980. The initial production batch featured a lightweight alloy frame, which proved to be unable to withstand the shock of the relatively high-powered 9√ó19mm Parabellum round in the long run. This was replaced around 1955 by the 'second series' model with a steel frame that proved to be totally adequate in endurance. The steel-framed version was nearly 250 grams heavier than the alloy version, but the balance was improved. In 1975-76 a small number of alloy frame pistols were made once again using the new alloy developed for the soon to be released Beretta 92 pistols. A special version of this second series (the \\"Egyptian Contract\\" model 951) was modified according to the wishes of the military of the Egyptian Arab Republic. Approximately 50,000 Egyptian Contract 951s were produced. Its particular modifications included larger sights, a simplified, narrower grip and external \\"thumb-spring\\" magazine release, rather than the push-button release in the lower-right grip of all other 951 versions. Beretta was in competition with Tokarev to become the primary supplier of sidearms to the new Egyptian republic. Despite intense pressure and incentives from the Soviet bloc, the Egyptians appreciated the 9√ó19mm Beretta's accuracy, power and uncanny reliability in desert conditions, and consequently, the Hungarian \\"Tokagypt\\" was produced in comparatively small quantities. The \\"third series\\" of the model 951 was the definitive production version. Its lengthened slide further improved the pistol's balance. The relatively large sights of the Egyptian Contract version were replaced - even on the Maadi-made Helwan 951 - by the original smaller, unobtrusive sights which were less likely to snag on a holster. Serial production of this definitive version initiated in Italy 1955, and in Egypt in the early 1960s. The M1951 is no longer produced in Italy and was never adopted by the Italian Army. The Italian Army instead opted to keep the .380 ACP Beretta M1934 in service until the adoption of the 9√ó19mm Beretta 92; the M1951 was instead adopted by the Italian Navy, the Carabinieri and the Italian national Traffic Police, but has since been replaced in all services with the above-mentioned Beretta 92, in 1977. Other military forces to have adopted the M1951 include Egypt (where it has been produced by the local firm Maadi as the \\"Helwan\\"), Israel, Iraq (license-built as the \\"Tariq\\"), Nigeria, Libya and Tunisia; in most of these countries, the pistol is now out of service. The pistol is known as the M951 \\"Brigadier\\" on the civilian market. After 1968, in the United States, it was briefly referred to as the 104 in promotional literature. Design details The M1951 is a short recoil-operated, locked breech pistol with a vertically falling locking piece and an open top slide (the locking mechanism design was influenced by the Walther P38 pistol). The locking piece, located under the barrel, is unlocked by a sliding pin and locked back into battery by a beveled surface on the pistol's frame. The locking piece features two locking lugs that engage appropriate recesses cut into the slide's internal side surfaces. When the pistol is fired, the locking piece, integral with the slide, goes back together with the barrel which is locked to the slide. After a brief period of unrestricted travel of approx. the unlocking pin on the rear barrel lug strikes the receiver and stops. As the barrel and slide continue back, the locking piece strikes the stationary plunger and is forced down into recesses in the slide. The barrel comes to rest but the slide continues rearward for a further . Upon forward return, the slide picks up the barrel and the locking piece on the barrel lug is lifted up by the receiver cam to lock the barrel to the slide. The spring-loaded extractor is integrated into the slide, and the fixed-type ejector is integral to the pistol's frame. The pistol has a hammer striking mechanism (with an exposed hammer) and a single-action trigger with a disconnector, which enables semi-automatic fire only. A cross-bolt safety mounted on the weapon's frame (beneath the hammer) provides safe operation with a cartridge introduced into the chamber. In the ‚Äúweapon safe‚Äù position (the safety's button pushed in to the left) the slide catch is disabled. The M1951 is fed from an 8-round detachable box magazine. A hold open device will keep the slide locked open after discharging the last cartridge from the magazine. The slide can then be released by depressing the slide release lever located on the left side of the frame. The pistol uses fixed iron sights set for engaging targets at 50 m. These consist of a forward blade and rear notch. The pistol's barrel has a rifled bore with 6 right-hand grooves and a 1 in 254 mm (1:10 in) twist rate. The M1951 pistol is chambered for the 9√ó19mm Parabellum cartridge. Variants The Modello 952 is a commercial version of the M1951 chambered in 7.65√ó21mm Parabellum. Produced for sales to sport shooters in Italy in order to comply with restrictions forbidding ownership of military caliber pistols. This model was available in two variants: the ‚ÄúTarget‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpecial‚Äù models. The \\"Target\\" version of the 952 incorporated modifications to the grips, sights and barrel that had originally been introduced on the \\"Berhama\\" target-shooting model of the 9mm 951 made specially for the Egyptians. The M951R is a select fire version of the M1951 chambered in 9 mm Parabellum. The \\"R\\" stands for Raffica, which is Italian for \\"volley\\", \\"flurry\\", or \\"burst\\" (sometimes spoken \\"R\\" as \\"Rapid\\" in English), which was designed and produced during the 1960s in response to a request made by the Italian special forces. The primary difference between the M951R and the original M1951 lied in the fire selector lever mounted on the right side of the weapon‚Äôs frame, enabling either semi-automatic or continuous fire - labelled \\"SEM\\" and \\"AUT\\", respectively. Additionally, the weapon has a heavier slide, a folding wooden forward grip, the barrel was extended, and so was the magazine, increasing capacity to 10 rounds. The M951R had a rate of fire of approximately 1000 rounds/min. The M951R was issued to several Italian special forces and to a lesser extent to the Carabinieri and the Polizia di Stato all along the 1960s; it had poor success and quickly went out of production, as it was plagued by several defects: the ammunition capacity was low compared to the rate of fire and, with the selector on the \\"AUT\\" position, the M951R fired in full-automatic mode rather than by three-rounds bursts as other similar products of the following years; this produced high recoil and resulted in poor controllability and scarce accuracy. Furthermore, with such a high rate of fire, even with extensive training it was impossible for the shooter to produce short and controlled bursts, and as reported by many users the shortest burst one could achieve was five-rounds.

Her presence, and a previous similar arrangement for another mistress in the royal houses, was also noted by the Spanish ambassador Pedro de Ayala.Dickson, Thomas, ed., Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1877), pp. cxxii-cxxxiv. Ayala later wrote of James IV: > \\"When I arrived, he was keeping a lady with great state in a castle. He > visited her from time to time. Afterwards he sent her to the house of her > father, who is a knight, and married her [to a third party]. He did the same > with another lady, by whom he had had a son.\\"Bergenroth, G., ed. & trans., > Calendar of State Papers, Spain, vol. 1 (London, 1862), no. 210. However, the king had a number of mistresses in his time, and this relationship seems to have been shorter than those he had with either Marion Boyd or Janet Kennedy. Family Margaret and James IV had a daughter, Margaret Stewart, known as \\"Lady Margaret\\". As a child she lived at Edinburgh Castle in the care of Sir Patrick Crichton and his wife, Katrine Turing, where one of her attendants was Ellen More.Miranda Kaufmann, Black Tudors (London, 2017), pp. 17-18: Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. li, 330, 478: Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1901), lxxxv, 114, 155, 172, 175, 310-11, 321-2, 336, 361, 371, 387: Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1902), pp. 339, 324, 401, 404. In February 1505 she started dancing lessons with a drummer called Guilliam.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1901), pp. 117, 129. There are records of her clothing, including, in June 1506; a gown of brown or russet cloth bordered with velvet, with velvet sleeves lined with taffeta, a satin kirtle or skirt, a hat and a tippet, a veil of \\"crisp\\", and ribbons for her hair.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1901), pp. 114-115. She married firstly John Gordon, Lord Gordon, and secondly Sir John Drummond of Innerpeffray. Brass plaque at Dunblane Cathedral commemorating Margaret Drummond and her sisters. Circumstances of death It is definitely known that in 1501 she died of food poisoning, along with her sisters Eupheme and Sibylla, while staying at Drummond Castle. As a general rule, claims of poisoning made in relation to a historical figure who died after a sudden illness should be treated with caution, but in this case, with three people who presumably died shortly after eating the same meal, the contemporary judgement should be accepted. The three sisters are buried together in Dunblane Cathedral, their graves can still be seen in front of the altar. This did not cause a great deal of suspicion at the time; standards of food hygiene are unlikely to have been very good then, and cases of accidental food poisoning have happened in any period. After her death the king paid for masses to be said for her soul, and continued to support their daughter. Murder theories It has been widely suggested in more recent years that Margaret Drummond was murdered, either by English agents or by pro-English elements in the Scottish nobility. Many believe that James IV was planning to or had already secretly married Drummond, and her death was necessary in order to allow or force the King to marry the English princess Margaret Tudor, daughter of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York. The (comparatively recent) plaque on her grave in Dunblane Cathedral claims that she was commonly believed to be \\"privately married\\" to the king, and that she was murdered by Scottish nobles who supported the English marriage. Furthermore, the \\"Marriage of the Rose and Thistle\\", as the poet William Dunbar described it, brought about the Union of the Crowns exactly 100 years later, as it enabled their great-grandson James VI of Scotland to claim the English throne upon the death of Elizabeth I through his descent from Henry VII. Had James IV married Margaret Drummond instead of Margaret Tudor, the Union of the Crowns might never have taken place and Scotland might have remained an independent country. This idea has been the theme of numerous historical novels and popular histories. Serious historians are skeptical of the theory. It is not supported by the contemporary evidence, and originates in a history of the Drummond family written by Viscount Strathallan in 1681. Her death was probably a case of accidental food poisoning, a common cause of death at that time. The idea that James had to be pressured to marry Margaret Tudor is dubious. As Scotland was the less important and poorer country, it is more likely that James IV pressured Henry VII to give him his daughter. It is also clear that negotiations for the marriage had been taking place before Margaret Drummond died.

Mal is played by actor Nathan Fillion in the 2002 TV series Firefly and the 2005 film Serenity. In the series, Mal is a former Browncoat sergeant and the captain of the \\"Firefly-class\\" spaceship Serenity. The character was named #18 in TV Guide Greatest Sci-Fi Legends list in 2004. Production details Conceived by Joss Whedon, the character Malcolm Reynolds was the only definite character he had in mind when formulating the ensemble cast. He wanted a hero, but not a hero in the classic sense; someone that is \\"everything that a hero is not.\\" In the proposed pilot, Mal was much darker and considerably more closed-off. Fox network executives objected, and asked that Mal be \\"lightened up\\". For the second episode (\\"The Train Job\\"), Whedon created a more \\"jolly\\" Mal Reynolds.Whedon, Train Job: Director's Commentary, Track 1 Fillion shares his view on the motivations of the character he portrayed. Mal has lost so much that each character in the crew he has gathered on Serenity represents an aspect of himself he no longer has. \\"In Wash, he has a lust for life and a sense of humor he's lost. In Jayne, he has selfishness. In Book, he has spirituality. In Kaylee, he has innocence. Everybody represents a facet of himself that he has lost and that's why he keeps them close and safe, and yet at arm's length.\\" =Casting= The role was originally written for Buffy the Vampire Slayer co-star Nicholas Brendon (who played Xander Harris);Q&A; with Nicholas Brendan ‚Äî Supanova Convention in Sydney, Australia - 13 October 2007, also Q&A; with Nicholas Brendan - Armageddon Expo in Melbourne, Australia - 23 October 2011. however, the shooting schedule conflicted with his commitment to Buffy. Whedon approached Nathan Fillion to play the lead, and after explaining the premise and showing Fillion the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role. Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that \\"It was really thrilling. It was my first lead and I was pretty nervous, but I really wanted that part and I wanted to tell those stories.\\"Whedon, Firefly Companion, Vol 1, p.26. =Costume design= Los Angeles prop shop Applied Effects was approached by Randy Erikson to create Mal's main gun, a \\"Moses Brothers Self-Defense Engine Frontier Model B\\", and gave them a week and a half. Erikson provided a foamcore conceptual mockup and the base guns, one of which was a five-shot .38 caliber Taurus Model 85 revolver. Erikson researched American Civil War-era revolvers for inspiration and the final mockup had a brass or bronze look, with the revolver a little elongated. The biggest challenge was masking the shape of the original revolver and still keeping it operable.Whedon, Firefly Companion, Vol 1, pp.79-80. On the TV series Firefly, a cast bronze pistol was used, but for the film Serenity, a more detailed replica was created which had moving action and a blank pistol hidden inside, so that it could be fired in close-ups. Since this version was quite heavy, a resin replica was also constructed, which in addition to being less tiring for the actors to carry, could be thrown or dropped with less fear of injury. Nonfunctional replicas of the gun are commercially available for fans and collectors. GBB Custom Gunleather was tasked with creating Mal's gun holster, which was made out of oak-tanned carving leather.Whedon, Firefly Companion, Vol 1, p.81. The character's coat, a relic of his time as a Browncoat, was a collaboration between Firefly costume designer Shawna Trpcic and Jonathan A. Logan, a leather artist. Trpcic sketched her idea and a cloth mockup was created before the final was made with domestic-farmed deerskin. The cuffs are actually the sleeves folded back, evoking the style of Oriental robes with their silk linings. Two coats were made for the character, one called \\"Number 1\\" coat and another called \\"The Hero\\" coat. The Number 1 coat's bullet hole is drawn in, while The Hero version has a detailed cut and sewn repair.Whedon, Firefly Companion, Vol 1, p.83. As with the gun, replicas of Malcolm Reynolds' coat have also been made available commercially for fans. Character biography Malcolm's main mission is to keep his crew alive and to keep his ship flying. As Firefly writer Tim Minear stated in an interview: \\"It's just about getting by. That's always been the mission statement of what the show is ‚Äî getting by.\\" In Serenity, Mal says of himself: \\"[If the] Wind blows Northerly, I go North.\\"Whedon, Serenity, DVD. Mal was raised by his mother and \\"about 40 hands\\" on a ranch on the planet Shadow.Whedon, Firefly: the complete series: \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\" Though Mal usually seems more practical than intellectual, he occasionally surprises his friends by displaying familiarity with disparate literature varying from the works of Xiang YuWhedon, Firefly: the complete series: \\"War Stories\\" to poems by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, though he has no idea \\"who\\" Mona Lisa is. Mal volunteered for the Independents army during the Unification War against the Alliance, gaining the rank of sergeant during that time. His loyal second-in-command Zoe was by his side for most of the war, surviving many dangerous conflicts with him. The show mentions three such battles, including the Battle of Du-Khang in 2510 (featured in \\"The Message\\") and a long winter campaign in New Kashmir (as told by Zoe in \\"War Stories\\") where he commanded a platoon. Mal was also involved in the ground campaign during the Battle of Sturges (as seen in the comic book Serenity: Those Left Behind), which according to Badger was the \\"bloodiest and shortest battle in all the war\\", although Mal considers it a distant second. Mal fought in many more battles, but the turning point for him and the Independents came with their physical and emotional defeat at the Battle of Serenity Valley on the planet Hera. On-screen information in Serenity shows him to have been attached to the 57th Overlanders Brigade; in the series pilot, Badger calls it the \\"Balls and Bayonets Brigade\\", though it is unclear whether this was a disparaging nickname coined by Badger himself or the actual unit sobriquet (a deleted scene in Serenity marks it as the actual unit nickname. It is unknown if the deleted scene can be considered canon or not). After the war, Mal acquired his own ship, a derelict 03-K64 Firefly-class transport. Mal named the ship Serenity after the Battle of Serenity Valley, the decisive battle of the Unification War. Reception Fillion won the \\"Cinescape Genre Face of the Future Award ‚Äî Male\\" award by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA for his role as Malcolm Reynolds. Fillion also won the SyFy Genre Awards in 2006 for Best Actor/Television and was runner-up for Best Actor/Movie. The character was named #18 in TV Guide's \\"Greatest Sci-fi legends\\" list in 2004. In 2008, Empire ranked Mal as #34 on their list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters. In 2011, SFX Magazine voted Mal Reynolds #1 on their Top 100 Sci-Fi icons of the century. In her review of the film Serenity for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis had this to say about the character and Nathan Fillion: \\"Mal is no Neo redux; he's closer to Indiana Jones, if absent Harrison Ford's rakishly handsome looks and star magnetism. Like the rest of the cast, Mr. Fillion is a charming performer, but he borrows rather than owns the screen, which dovetails with Mr. Whedon's modest aspirations for this film.\\" Notes References  Firefly (TV series) characters Science fiction film characters Fictional ship captains Fictional mercenaries Fictional sergeants Fictional smugglers Space pirates Western (genre) characters Television characters introduced in 2002 Atheism in television Male characters in television ","title":"Malcolm Reynolds"},{"id":"1377720","text":"This is a list of Italian sail frigates of the period 1640-1840: Venice: *Cavalier Angelo *Pallade *Venere *Minerva - Wrecked c. 1792 *Brillante 40? - Captured by France 1797 and renamed Montenotte, BU c. 1801 *Bellona - Captured by Austria 1798 *Medusa 40? - Captured by France 1797 and renamed Leoben, captured by Britain 1801 *? - Captured by France 1797, renamed Muiron *Carr√®re - Captured by France 1797 *Palma 40? - Captured by France 1797 and renamed Lonato *Cerere 40? - Captured by France 1797 and renamed Mantoue, captured by Turkey 1801 *(6 frigates) - Captured and scuttled by France, 1797 *Bellona 32 - Captured by Britain in the Battle of Lissa, 1811, and renamed Dover *Corona 40 - Captured by Britain in the Battle of Lissa, 1811, and renamed Daedalus *Carolina 32 - Took part in the Battle of Lissa, 1811 Naples: *Pallade 40 - Scuttled 1799 *Minerva 40 *Sibilla 40 *Sirena 40 *Aretusa 40 *Leone (?) *Partenope 36 (1834) *Regina 50 (1840) Sardinia: *San Michele 66 (1841) Frigates, sail Italian sailing ","title":"List of Italian sailing frigates"},{"id":"1377724","text":"Dunblane Cathedral is the larger of the two Church of Scotland parish churches serving Dunblane, near the city of Stirling, in central Scotland. The lower half of the tower is pre-Romanesque from the 11th century, and was originally free-standing, with an upper part added in the 15th century. Most of the rest of the building is Gothic, from the 13th century. The building was restored by Rowand Anderson from 1889‚Äì93. History The Cathedral was once the seat of the bishops of Dunblane (also sometimes called 'of Strathearn'), until the abolition of bishops after the Glorious Revolution in 1689. There are remains of the vaults of the episcopal palace to the south of the cathedral. Technically, it is no longer a cathedral, as there are no bishops in the Church of Scotland, which is a Presbyterian denomination. After the abolition of prelacy, the choir became the parish church but the nave fell out of use, and its roof had fallen in by about 1600. It contains the graves of Margaret Drummond of Stobhall, a mistress of King James IV of Scotland and her two sisters, all said to have been poisoned. Unusually, the building is owned by the Crown, and is looked after by Historic Scotland rather than the church governance; there is no entrance charge. The building is largely 13th century in date, though it incorporates an originally freestanding bell-tower (like the example at Muthill) of 11th century date on its south side. This tower was increased in height in the 15th century, a change clearly visible in the colour of the stonework, and in the late Gothic style of the upper storey's windows. The choir is unaisled, but has a long vaulted chamber which served as chapter house and sacristy on its north side. The choir contains the mural tomb of the Cathedral's founder, Bishop Clement. Many of the 15th century choir stalls, which have carved misericords (including one with an unusual depiction of a bat) are preserved within the choir. Further, more elaborate, canopied stalls are preserved at the west end of the nave. Dunblane has the largest surviving collection of medieval Scottish ecclesiastical woodwork after King's College Chapel, Aberdeen. Some detached fragments are displayed in the town's museum. The cathedral was restored in the late 19th century under the control of Rev Alexander Ritchie DD, who commissioned architect Robert Rowand Anderson to oversee the works, with these works completed by Sir Robert Lorimer in 1912.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer Burials Preserved within the arcaded nave are two early Christian stones, a cross-slab and a possible architectural frieze, survivals from an early medieval church on the same site, founded by or dedicated to the 'Blane' whose name is commemorated in the name of the town. Dunblane Cathedral churchyard contains two war graves, including that of William Stirling, a gunner in the Royal Marine Artillery during World War I.

H. Auden (\\"We are linked as children in a circle dancing\\"). Other churches in Dunblane Dunblane Cathedral is one of at least seven churches in the town. The others are St Blane's (another Church of Scotland congregation, named after the town's founder), St Mary's (a Scottish Episcopal Church congregation), the Roman Catholic Church dedicated to the Holy Family, the Quaker Meeting House, the (independent Evangelical) Dunblane Christian Fellowship, and the Eastern Orthodox parish dedicated to Saint Nicholas; unusually, this Orthodox community is Old Calendarist and thus comes directly under the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarchate rather than the nearest Orthodox bishop.

The town is a tourist destination known as \\"Zell am See-Kaprun\\" with the neighbouring Zell am See and known for the glacier Kitzsteinhorn. Geography It is located in the Pinzgau region on the northern slopes of the Alpine Glockner Group with Mt. Gro√ües Wiesbachhorn, , part of the Hohe Tauern range, forming the border of Salzburg with Carinthia. At the foot of the Kitzsteinhorn Glacier, Kaprun is a year-round sports centre. The Kapruner Ache creek joins the Salzach River south of the settlement. The Mooserboden hydroelectric plant uses water from two reservoirs held back by some of Austria's largest dam walls. The reservoir area has become a tourist attraction, with views over the towns of Kaprun and Zell am See. The visitors centre gives guided tours of the area. Tauern Spa World was completed in November 2010, and is the second largest spa complex in Austria. It is a two- hour transfer to resort from Salzburg Airport.

Chaprunne Castle was acquired by the Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg in 1287 and enfeoffed to the Lords of Felben in 1338. Seat of a Salzburg burgrave from 1480, it was devastated during the 1526 German Peasants' War. In 1606 Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau had the local burgrave beheaded for siding with local insurgents. In the early 20th century the castle was a possession of Prince Johann II of Liechtenstein, who sold it in 1921. In the late 1920s the German AEG company and the Salzburg state government developed plans for a Hohe Tauern hydroelectricity power plant, including two reservoirs in the Kaprun Valley. Planning was discontinued during the Great Depression and was not resumed until the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938. Commanded by Hermann G√∂ring, construction began during World War II using prisoners of war from Belgium and other occupied countries and Jewish and Soviet forced labourers. The inhumane conditions were depicted by Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek in her 2003 play Das Werk. Construction stopped in 1942/43, and was restarted after the war by Allied-occupied Austria from 1947. Built with Bucyrus equipment and massive help from the Marshall Plan European Recovery Program, the power plant became an icon of post-war reconstruction. The topping out ceremony was held on 23 September 1955, a few months after the signing of the Austrian State Treaty. Gletscherbahnen The Kitzsteinhorn is accessed by the Gletscherbahn 1, an aerial lift in three sections, opened on 12 December 1965 to develop the area for glacier skiing. The lowest section, running from Kapruner Thoerl up to the Salzburg Hut, is 2028 metres long and climbs 970 metres in altitude. The second section, to the Krefeld Hut, climbs 554 metres. The third section, from the Krefeld Hut, is long and climbs 575 metres. This section includes the world's tallest aerial lift pylon, a steel framework construction 113.9 metres (originally 106 meters) high. This pillar was built in 1966 and has of a pipe of diameter in the center, in which a ladder and a maintenance elevator are installed. Gletscherbahn 2 was a funicular railway with two carriages running from Kaprun to the Kitzsteinhorn, opened on 23 March 1974. This railway had the unusual track gauge of , and a length of , of which was through a tunnel. On 11 November 2000, it was the site of the Kaprun disaster, in which 149 skiers lost their lives in a tunnel fire. Six more deaths occurred indirectly. Three died in the shop and restaurant because of smoke. The attendant in the burning train died with the 149 skiers. The smoke killed the attendant and the only passenger in the other identical train. Only 12 people survived the burning train. The tunnel and the funicular railway has remained closed since then.

The Azes Era Azes's most lasting legacy was the foundation of the Azes era. It was widely believed that the era was begun by Azes's successors by simply continuing the counting of his regnal years. However, Prof. Harry Falk has recently presented an inscription at several conferences which dates to Azes's reign, and suggests that the era may have been begun by Azes himself. Most popular historians date the start of the Azes era to 58 BC and believe it is the same as the later era known as the Malwa or Vikrama era. However, a recently discovered inscription, the Bajaur reliquary inscription, dated in both the Azes and the Greek era suggests that actually this is not the case. The inscription gives the relationship Azes = Greek + 128. It is believed that the Greek era may have begun in 173 BCE, exactly 300 years before the first year of the Era of Kanishka.

Historically, the expectations of staging/blocking have changed substantially over time in Western theater. Prior to the movements toward \\"realism\\" that occurred in the 19th century, most staging used a \\"tableau\\" approach, in which a stage picture was established whenever characters entered or left the stage, ensuring that leading performers were always shown to their best advantage. In more recent times while nothing has changed about showing leading performers to best advantage there have been changing cultural expectations that have made blocking/staging more complicated. There are also artistic reasons why blocking can be crucial. Through careful use of positioning on the stage, a director or performer can establish or change the significance of a scene. Different artistic principles can inform blocking, including minimalism and naturalism. Etymology Both \\"blocking\\" and \\"block\\" were applied to stage and theater from as early as 1961. The term derives from the practice of 19th- century theatre directors such as Sir W. S. Gilbert who worked out the staging of a scene on a miniature stage using blocks to represent each of the actors. Gilbert's practice is depicted in Mike Leigh's 1999 film Topsy-Turvy. Blocking in theater and film In contemporary theater, the director usually determines blocking during rehearsal, telling actors where they should move for the proper dramatic effect, ensure sight lines for the audience and work with the lighting design of the scene. Each scene in a play is usually \\"blocked\\" as a unit, after which the director will move on to the next scene. The positioning of actors on stage in one scene will usually affect the possibilities for subsequent positioning unless the stage is cleared between scenes. During the blocking rehearsal, the assistant director, stage manager or director take notes about where actors are positioned and their movements on stage. It is especially important for the stage manager to note the actors' positions, as a director is not usually present for each performance, and it becomes the stage manager's job to ensure that actors follow the assigned blocking from night to night. In film, the term is sometimes used to speak of the arrangement of actors in the frame. In this context, there is also a need to consider the movement of the camera as part of the blocking process (see Cinematography). Stage directions House left/right are from the audience's perspective The stage itself has been given named areas to facilitate blocking. *The rear of the stage area, farthest from the audience, is upstage. The front, nearest the audience, is downstage. The terms derive from the once common use of raked stages that slope downward toward the audience. *In English-speaking cultures generally, stage left and stage right refer to the actors' left and right when facing the audience. Sometimes the terms prompt and bastard/opposite prompt are used as synonyms. (See also Prompt corner) *House left and house right refer to the audience perspective. In productions for film or video, analogous terms are screen left/right and camera left/right. *To cross is to move. An actor placed up-stage right in blocking may be instructed by a director to cross down-stage left when speaking a line. =Non-English-speaking cultures= French Map of the Th√©√¢tre des Tuileries In French, house right is c√¥t√© cour (courtyard side) and house left is c√¥t√© jardin (garden side). The history of the term goes back to the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, where since 1770, the troupe performed in the Th√©√¢tre des Tuileries in the former Tuileries Palace: the venue had the Louvre courtyard on one side, and the Tuileries Garden on the other side. Before that time the house right was called \\"c√¥t√© de la reine\\" (Queen side), and the house left \\"c√¥t√© du roi\\" (King side), because of the respective positions of the Queen and King galleries. This designation was abandoned after the French Revolution. Cantonese opera In Cantonese opera, stage right is called yi bin (the side of clothings) and stage left is zaap bin (the side of props). Other languages In German, Italian and Arabic, left and right always refer to the audience perspective.

The play was initially produced on Broadway by The Group Theatre in 1937. Odets' biggest hit was made into a 1939 film of the same name, starring William Holden in his breakthrough role, and also served as the basis for a 1964 musical with Sammy Davis, Jr.. Plot Joe Bonaparte, a young Italian-American man and talented violinist, dreams of becoming a professional musician. Joe, however, fights a boxing match for manager Tom Moody, which he wins. Joe's father, Mr. Bonaparte, has scraped up enough money to afford a top-of-the-line violin for Joe's 21st birthday. However, upon learning of Joe's fight from Joe's brother Frank, Mr. Bonaparte decides not to give Joe the violin. Two months later, Joe has become a successful boxer for Moody and Roxy Gottlieb, a prizefight promoter. However, Joe won't throw punches, attempting to protect his hands. Later, Joe prepares to go on a boxing tour, where Mr. Bonaparte presents Joe with the violin. Joe plays it, but tells his father to return it. Six months later, Joe's career continues to advance. Infamous gangster Eddie Fuseli approaches Moody and Roxy, demanding to be signed on as a partner, which Joe agrees to. Moody, believing Joe to be distracted by his fame, convinces his girlfriend Lorna to talk to Joe. She does so, and the pair profess their love to each other. Despite this, Lorna cannot bring herself to break off her relationship with Moody. Feeling that he has lost Lorna as well as his father's respect, Joe no longer holds back in the ring. In his next match, Joe defeats his opponent, but breaks a hand, thereby ruining any future career he may have had as a violinist. Six months later, Joe has become a top-ranked prizefighter. He has become disillusioned with his fame and his managers, and has become more vicious in the ring. After learning Lorna is engaged to Moody, Joe confronts her and they argue, where Lorna accuses Joe of being a killer like Fuseli. Disoriented, Joe is unable to stay focused against his opponent, but pulls through with a victory. Before the celebration begins, Joe learns his final blow has killed his opponent. Meanwhile, Joe's managers arrive at the Bonaparte home to wait for Joe and Lorna. Frank receives a call informing him that Joe and Lorna have died in a car accident. Mr. Bonaparte prepares to retrieve the body, saying he will bring Joe \\"home ... where he belongs.\\" Production history Following his 1935 successes Waiting for Lefty and Awake and Sing!, Odets went to Hollywood to write The General Died at Dawn with the intention of using his salary to support the Group Theatre, the independent theatre company that had produced his earlier plays,Lahr, John.\\"Stage Left, The struggles of Clifford Odets\\"The New Yorker, April 17, 2006\\"Clifford Odets Papers 1926-1963 at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts\\" jewish-theatre.com, retrieved March 27, 2010 despite his previous protests against large corporations, including movie studios.

In 1958, he was named Director of the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, and in 1962 became President of the Juilliard School, a position he held until his death in 1983. Under his leadership, Juilliard moved from Claremont Avenue to its present location at Lincoln Center. Mennin is responsible for the addition of drama and dance departments at Juilliard. He also started the Master Class Program, and brought many artists to teach including Maria Callas, Pierre Fournier and others. Biography The musically gifted son of Italian immigrants who settled in Erie, Mennin started his first orchestral piece at eleven and completed his first symphony (out of nine he would eventually write) before his 19th birthday. He began his studies at the Oberlin Conservatory with Norman Lockwood when he was 16, but left in 1941 to join the U. S. Army Air Force. He continued his studies with Howard Hanson at the Eastman School of Music, where he received his BA and master's degree in 1945. His Third Symphony, finished the day he turned 23 and initially written for his PhD requirements at Eastman, immediately catapulted him to music prominence. The work was performed by the New York Philharmonic the following year, and it led Mennin‚Äôs appointment to the composition faculty of The Juilliard School. It was a runner up for the Pulitzer Prize in 1950. Dr. Mennin led the first artistic exchange with the Soviet Union in 1958, where he spent six weeks. He received two Guggenheim fellowships for Music composition, in 1949 and 1957. Mennin wrote nine symphonies, several concertos, and numerous works for wind band, chorus, and other ensembles. His style became more chromatic and astringent with time, but was always essentially tonal, relying heavily on polyphony. His work received renewed attention in the CD era; all of his symphonies have been recorded, with the exception of the first two symphonies, which have been withdrawn. Juilliard awards an annual Peter Mennin prize for Outstanding Achievement and Leadership in Music. His notable students include Van Cliburn, Jacob Druckman, Richard Danielpour, Karl Korte, Charles L.

Early life and family Born at Braelangwell, Cromarty, Scotland,Dictionary of National Biography (1899), vol.58, p.43 Urquhart was educated, under the supervision of his widowed mother, in France, Switzerland, and Spain. He returned to Britain in 1821 and spent a gap year learning farming and working at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich before attending St John's College, Oxford. He never completed his classics degree as his mother's finances failed. In 1854 Urquhart married Harriet Angelina Fortescue, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, and the couple had three sons (one of whom, William, died aged only thirteen months; Francis Fortescue Urquhart was another), and two daughters. She wrote numerous articles in the Diplomatic Review under the signature of Caritas, and died in 1889. Career =Role in Greece and Turkey= In 1827, Urquhart joined the nationalist cause in the Greek War of Independence. Seriously injured, he spent the next few years championing the Greek cause in letters to the British government, a self-promotion that entailed his appointment in 1831 to Sir Stratford Canning's mission to Istanbul to settle the border between Greece and Turkey. Urquhart's principal role was to nurture the support of Koca Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha, intimate advisor to the Sultan Mahmud II. He found himself increasingly attracted towards Turkish civilisation and culture, becoming alarmed at the threat of Russian intervention in the region. Urquhart's campaigning, including publication of Turkey and its Resources, culminated in his appointment on a trade mission to the region in 1833. He struck such an intimate relationship with the government in Istanbul that he became outspoken in his calls for British intervention on behalf of the Sultan against Muhammad Ali of Egypt in opposition to the policy of Canning. He was recalled by Palmerston just as he published his anti-Moscow pamphlet England, France, Russia and Turkey which brought him into conflict with Richard Cobden. The Circassian national flag that was designed by David Urquhart. In 1835 he was appointed secretary of embassy at Constantinople, but an unfortunate attempt to counteract Russian aggressive designs in Circassia, which threatened to lead to an international crisis, again led to his recall in 1837. Urquhart's position was aggressively so anti-Russian and Pro-Turkish to the extent that it created difficulties for British politics. In the 1830s, there was no anti-Russian coalition in Europe; it had yet to be created. Britain could suddenly find itself in a situation of military conflict with Russia and, moreover, alone. As a result, Urquhart was recalled from Turkey, and the conflict with Russia was settled by peace talks. There was still a lot of time before the Crimean war. In 1835, before leaving for the East, he founded a periodical called the Portfolio, and in the first issue printed a series of Russian state papers, which made a profound impression.Dictionary of National Biography (1899), vol.58, p.44 Urquhart was also the designer of the Circassian national flag (which as adopted as the flag of Adygea in 1992). Urquhart later publicly accused Palmerston, the head of British foreign policy, of being bribed by Russia. This view was constantly promoted in the London magazines he published. Among the regular authors of his publications was Karl Marx, who fully supported Urquhart's views on Palmerston. Personally, Karl Marx himself, in correspondence with his friend Engels, considered Urquhart a \\"form of maniac\\" in his accusations of Palmerston and the worship of the Turks.Franz Mering. \\"Karl Marx. His life story.\\" Moscow. Gospolitizdat. 1957. p. 264 In 1838 Urquhart published a book, Spirit of the East, where he examines Turkey and Greece, while also drawing on work previously done by Arthur Lumley Davids.https://archive.org/details/spiritofeast00urquuoft =Politics= From 1847 to 1852 he sat in parliament as member for Stafford, and carried on a vigorous campaign against Lord Palmerston's foreign policy. He was against the imposition of sanitary reform, and vehemently opposed the passage of the Public Health Act 1848.Urquhart, D (1848) in Hansard , Commons Sitting, 5 May 1848, 98, p717 The action of the United Kingdom in the Crimean War provoked indignant protests from Urquhart, who contended that Turkey was in a position to fight her own battles without the assistance of other powers. To attack the government, he organized \\"foreign affairs committees\\" which became known as Urquhartite, throughout the country, and in 1856 (with finance from ironmaster George Crawshay) became the owner of the Free Presshttp://www.victorianturkishbath.org/2history/atozhist/clean/pix/free%20press_w.htm (in 1866 renamed the Diplomatic Review), which numbered among its contributors the socialist Karl Marx. In 1860 he published his book on Lebanon.Dictionary of National Biography (1899), vol.58, p.45 Later life From 1864 until his death, Urquhart's health compelled him to live on the Continent, he lived in Clarens, Switzerland next to Lake Geneva. Here he devoted his energies to promoting the study of international law. He is buried in Clarens. Promoter of the Turkish bath Turkish Baths in Jermyn Street, 1862 Urquhart introduced Turkish baths into Great Britain. He advocated their use in his book The Pillars of Hercules (1850), which attracted the attention of the Irish physician Richard Barter. Barter introduced them in his system of hydropathy at Blarney, County Cork. The Turkish baths at 76 Jermyn Street, London were built under Urquhart's direction.

The panorama was created by 13 Russian and Bulgarian artists and was constructed in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Pleven Epopee and was officially unveiled on 10 December 1977. The panorama expanded the already existing Skobelev Park, which is the site of three of the four major battles which led to the liberation of Bulgaria. In the first three years after its opening, 2.5 million people visited the panorama. The monument is one of nearly 200 built by the people of Pleven in tribute to the battle and to the nearly 35,000 lives lost. Siege of Plevna A detail of the siege in the interior of the panorama The Pleven Panorama depicts the events of the Siege of Plevna, which consisted of four major battles over a five-month period (20 July-10 December 1877), focusing on the third battle. The siege was pivotal in the outcome in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, which eventually resulted in the liberation of Bulgaria as well as Serbia and Romania from 500 years of Ottoman control. At the time, Plevna was under Turkish control as Field Marshal Osman Pasha had set up fortifications there following his defeat at the Nikopol on 16 July. Osman was successful at fending off the Russian attacks on them during the first two battles. In the third battle, which began on 31 August and culminated on 11 September 1877, Russian forces under the command of General Mikhail Skobelev took two Turkish redoubts and a Romanian division took a third, the Grivitsa redoubt. Osman's troops were able to recapture the two redoubts taken by the Russians, but they were unable to dislodge the Romanians from Grivitsa. This battle was the bloodiest for the Russian forces, with roughly 20,000 losses, but was also the turning point in the Siege. By 24 October, Russian and Romanian forces had surrounded Plevna. Osman requested permission to retreat, but the Ottoman high command would not allow him to do so. On 9 December Osman and his troops made a brief sally, defeated after initial success and incurring losses of 5,000 men. Osman was wounded. The next day, Osman surrendered the city to Romanian colonel Mihail Cerchez. Construction and unveiling Pleven Panorama under construction, July 1977 Most of the historical landmarks in Pleven are related to the Russo- Turkish war, with around 200 monuments commemorating the bloodiest battles of the war. The Pleven Panorama was constructed in honor of the centennial of the surrender of Turkish forces to Russian and Romanian troops, ending the siege on Plevna. It was conceived and designed by N. Ovetchkin, an author from Moscow as a counterpart to the Borodin Panorama in Belgorod, Russia. The panorama is situated in Skobelev Park, named for the general who commanded the Russian forces and led them to victory over the Turks at Plevna, and the site upon which the deciding battle of the five-month siege on the city occurred. Eleven Russian and two Bulgarian artists painted and constructed the panoramic painting which includes a 115√ó15-meter main canvas and 12-meter foreground. The goal of Ovetchkin and the artists who created the panorama was to create a feeling of empathy for the battle that was fought on the site as well as a feeling of authenticity of the events that occurred on 11 September 1877. The panorama opened to the public on 10 December 1977, 100 years to the day that Field Marshal Osman Pasha surrendered to Colonel Mihail Cerchez, ending the Pleven Epopee. Composition The architectural unit is composed of four rooms: introductory, panoramic, diorame and finale.

A member of the noble House of Stratford and cousin of George Canning, he served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister-Plenipotentiary to the United States of America between 1820 and 1824 and held his first appointment as Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire between 1825 and 1828. He intermittently represented several constituencies in parliament between 1828 and 1842. In 1841 he was re- appointed as Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, a position he held for the next 17 years. In 1852 he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, probably in reference to his supposed descent from the great 15th- century merchant family of Canynges of Redcliffe near Bristol. However, despite his illustrious diplomatic career, Canning's hopes of high political office were frequently dashed. Background and education Canning was the youngest of the five children of Stratford Canning (1744‚Äì1787), an Irish-born merchant based in London, by his wife Mehitabel, daughter of Robert Patrick. He was born at his father's house of business in St. Clement's Lane, in the heart of London. When he was 6 months old Canning's father died in 1787 so his mother and siblings went to live in a cottage at Wanstead, where he would holiday for the rest of his life. Mehitabel Canning continued her husband's business until her eldest son could take her place. His eldest brother Henry Canning became British Consul in Hamburg in 1823, a posting he retained for the rest of his life. Henry Canning died at Hamburg in 1841. Another brother, William Canning (1778-1860) was a Canon of Windsor from 1828 to 1860, while another brother, Charles Fox Canning (1784‚Äì1815), was at the time of his death a lieutenant colonel to the Guards, Aide-de-Camp to the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo. He was also a first cousin of prime minister George Canning and Lord Garvagh. He was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge. His mother was a widow with little money, but powerful relatives especially George Canning. Canning Stratford began his education at a Dame's school at the age of four. At the age of 6 he left to attend Mr. Newcome's school at Hackney. Thanks to help from George Canning, he attended Eton for ten years, then King's College Cambridge in 1806-7. Diplomatic career, 1807‚Äì1831 In 1807 Canning was given a minor role in the Foreign Office by his cousin (as deputy to Col. Norton Powlett, Clerk of the Signet), and was sent with Anthony Merry on a mission to Denmark later that year. His first trip to Constantinople came in 1808, when he accompanied the mission of Robert Adair that restored peace between Britain and the Turks. When Adair left Constantinople in 1810, Canning became Minister Plenipotentiary, and it was Canning who helped mediate the Treaty of Bucharest between the Ottomans and Russia on 28 May 1812. Canning returned to London later that year, and helped to found the Quarterly Review. In June 1814 was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister-Plenipotentiary to Switzerland, where he, along with the other allied representatives, helped negotiate Swiss neutrality and a new Swiss federal constitution. In October he went to Vienna, where he acted as an aid to Lord Castlereagh, the British representative at the Congress of Vienna. After the negotiation of Swiss neutrality in 1815, Canning's role there became dull to him, but he stayed until 1819, when he was recalled and sent to Washington as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister-Plenipotentiary to the United States. Although he hoped for major accomplishments in Washington that would allow him to move up to a larger position, he was largely unsuccessful. The initiative of his cousin George, this time as Foreign Secretary, for a joint Anglo-American guarantee of Latin American independence, led to the promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine. In 1820 Canning was made a member of the Privy Council. Canning returned to London in 1823, and the next year was sent on a mission to Russia, where he negotiated a treaty on the border between Russian and British North America, but failed to come to any agreement regarding the Greek Revolt. Later in February 1825 he concluded a treaty with Russia on the north-west American frontier (Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825)).The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1820-1832, ed. D.R. Fisher, 2009 In 1825, Canning was returned to Constantinople, this time as Ambassador. He fled the city following the Battle of Navarino in 1827, but after a brief return to London he, along with the French and Russian ambassadors who had also fled, set up camp at Poros. In 1828 he and the other ambassadors participated in the Conference of Poros, which recommended to their respective governments the establishment of a separate Greek state, including the islands of Crete, Samos, and Euboea. Although he had been encouraged in this generous position towards the Greeks by his superior, Lord Aberdeen, this move was disavowed by the government, and Canning resigned. Diplomatic career, 1831‚Äì1841 Following his return, Canning attempted to enter British politics, entering the House of Commons in 1831, but was not a particularly notable figure in the Commons. When the Whigs entered office and the Canningite Lord Palmerston became British foreign secretary, Canning returned again to Constantinople in 1831, but returned in 1832, disapproving of Palmerston's lack of consultation with him and the choice of Prince Otto of Bavaria as King of Greece. That year, he was appointed Ambassador to Russia, but never took the office, as Tsar Nicholas I refused to receive him. Canning was, however, sent on a new diplomatic mission, to Madrid, where he was to deal with the rival claimants to the Portuguese throne, but was largely unsuccessful. He turned again, attempting again to pursue a course in domestic politics, associating himself with Lord Stanley's band of renegade Whigs, but when Stanley's followers entered government with Sir Robert Peel in 1841, Canning again was not offered a post. Going to Lord Aberdeen, the new Foreign Secretary, with whom his relations remained ambiguous, Canning was this time offered the Constantinople embassy. Ambassador to Constantinople, 1842‚Äì1858 Stratford Canning circa 1860 Canning's term in Constantinople lasted from 1842 to 1852. When Canning's old ally Stanley, now Earl of Derby, formed a government in 1852, Canning hoped to receive the foreign office, or at least the Paris embassy. Instead, he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, in the County of Somerset. He returned home in 1852, but when Aberdeen's coalition government was formed, Stratford de Redcliffe was returned to Constantinople. In Constantinople for the last time, Stratford came in the midst of a crisis caused by the dispute between Napoleon III and Nicholas I over the protection of the holy places. This crisis ultimately led to the Crimean War. Stratford is accused of encouraging the Turks to reject the compromise agreement during the Menshikov mission. It appears that he was consistently urging the Turks to reject compromises arguing that any Russian treaty, or facsimile thereof, would be to subject the Ottoman Empire to protectorate status under Tsar Nicholas I. He left Constantinople for the last time in 1857, and resigned early the next year. Retirement For the next twenty-two years Lord Stratford de Redcliffe lived in retirement, pursuing scholarly activities and deeply bored by his absence from public life. He attended the House of Lords regularly and spoke frequently on foreign policy matters as a cross-bencher. In 1869 he was made a Knight of the Garter. During the Eastern Crisis of the 1870s, Stratford wrote frequent letters in The Times on the subject. In September 1876 William Ewart Gladstone dedicated his pamphlet \\"Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East\\" to him. Family An illustration of the second lady Redcliffe visiting a hospital in √úsk√ºdar, which at the time was known as Scutari. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe was twice married. His first wife, Harriet daughter to Thomas and Harriet Raikes, died in her 27th year at Lausanne in February 1817, probably in childbirth. His second wife, Eliza Charlotte Alexander (1805‚Äì1882), bore him (at least) five children of whom four survived to adulthood. These were: * Hon. Louisa Charlotte Canning (1828‚Äì1908) * Hon. George Stratford Canning (1832‚Äì1878) * Hon. Catherine Jane Canning (1835‚Äì1884) * Hon. Mary Elizabeth Canning (1837‚Äì1905) All his children died unmarried. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe himself died at the age of 93 in 1880, his peerage becoming extinct. He is buried underneath a large very grey monument on the western side of the grave yard at Frant in Sussex, England. Reputation As ambassador to the Sublime Porte of the Ottoman Sultan, Stratford Canning played a major role in high level diplomacy, since Britain was the chief supporter, advocate and protector of the Ottoman Empire.

He was reputed to be the world's oldest professor and the founder of modern nutrition science in China, having lived to the age of 110.  Career  In 1924 Zheng Ji passed the entrance exam for the Southeast National University (originally known as the Nanjing Advanced Normal School, moving in 1928 to the National Central University, and then to the Nanjing University) biology department in 1929. In 1930 he went to America to study, majoring in biochemistry at Ohio State. He also attended Yale and Indiana University, and in 1936 he obtained his PhD. Upon returning to China he successively served as a research fellow at the Scientific Research Institute of China; as a professor at the Central Medical School; as both a biochemistry professor and department head, simultaneously, at the Eastern China Military Medical School; as a professor at the Number 4 Military Medical College; and as both a biology professor and the head of the biochemistry teaching and research department at the Nanjing Medical School. In 1945, at the Central Medical School, he established a biochemistry research institute to train graduate students. This was the first formal organization in China to teach biochemistry to graduate students, training a large number of students who went on to work in a variety of fields. After turning 70 he began to study the biochemistry of old age, proposing a theory of metabolic imbalance, forming the basis of geriatric biochemistry in China. He participated in the establishment of the Chinese Nutrition Society and, later on, the Biochemistry Society. He was a past chairman of the Central University Professors Association and the first council chair of the Chinese Nutrition Society.

It was founded on 4 April 1959 as a territory with self-rule within the French Community and became independent after negotiations with France on 20 June 1960. Two months later, on 19 August 1960, the Sudanese Republic leaders in the Mali Federation mobilized the army, and Senegal leaders in the federation retaliated by mobilizing the gendarmerie (national police); this resulted in a tense stand-off, and led to the withdrawal from the federation by Senegal the next day. The Sudanese Republic officials resisted this dissolution, cut off diplomatic relations with Senegal, and defiantly changed the name of their country to Mali. For the brief existence of the Mali Federation, the premier was Modibo Ke√Øta, who would become the first President of the Republic of Mali after the Mali Federation dissolved, and its government was based in Dakar, Senegal. Background After World War II, the colonies of French West Africa began pushing significantly for increased self- determination and to redefine their colonial relationships with France. Following the May 1958 crisis, the colonies of French West Africa were given the chance to vote for immediate independence or to join a reorganized French Community (an arrangement which would grant the colonies some self- determination while maintaining ties to France). Only Guinea voted for full independence and the other colonies of French West Africa voted to join the French Community. In the 1958 election to decide the issue of independence, two major parties split the countries of west Africa: the African Democratic Rally (, commonly known as the RDA) and the African Regroupment Party (, commonly known as the PRA). The two regional groupings of parties struggled against one another on the issue of independence and the extent of ties with France. The RDA was the governing party in the Ivory Coast colony, the French Sudan colony, and Guinea while the PRA was a major governing party in Senegal and had sizable majorities in many countries. The two parties also were part of coalition governments in French Upper Volta, Niger, and French Dahomey. Both two parties struggled with each other to shape the political future of the region, Mauritania often became a neutral party that would break any deadlocks. The vote of 1958 revealed a number of divisions within the parties. The RDA held a congress on 15 November 1958 to discuss the recent election results and the division became clear with Modibo Ke√Øta from French Sudan and Doudou Gueye from Senegal arguing for primary federation, which would include France and the colonies in a unified system, and F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny of the Ivory Coast dismissing that idea. The resulting deadlock was so severe that the meeting was officially said to have never taken place. Formation Colonies of French West Africa In late November 1958, French Sudan, Senegal, Upper Volta and Dahomey all declared the intention to join the French Community and form a federation linking the four colonies together. French Sudan and Senegal, despite longstanding divisions between their main political parties, were the most enthusiastic pushers for the federation, but Dahomey and Upper Volta were more hesitant in their desire to join the federation. French Sudan called for representatives of each of the four countries (and Mauritania as an observer) to Bamako on 28 to 30 December to discuss the formation of the federation. French Sudan and Senegal were the leaders at the congress with Modibo Ke√Øta named the president of the meeting and L√©opold S√©dar Senghor of Senegal being the key leader on many issues, including developing the name Mali Federation for the proposed union. Although Upper Volta and Dahomey declared formal support for the federation, and Upper Volta even approved the Mali Federation Constitution on 28 January 1959, political pressure from France and the Ivory Coast, both of which opposed the federation although for very different reasons, resulted in neither ratifying a constitution that would include them within the federation. The result is that only the colonies of French Sudan (now called the Sudanese Republic) and Senegal were engaged in the discussions of the formation of the federation by 1959. Elections in March 1959 in both French Sudan and Senegal cemented the power of the major parties pushing for the formation of a federation. Ke√Øta's Union Soudanaise-Rassemblement D√©mocratique Africain (US-RDA) won 76% of the votes in French Sudan and all of the seats in the territorial assembly. Senghor's Union Progressiste S√©n√©galaise (UPS) won 81% of the vote and all of the seats in Senegal's territorial assembly. Although Senghor won the elections by a large margin, some conservative Islamist marabouts supported the candidacy of Cheikh Tidjane Sy. That challenge to Senghor's party showed some of the weakness in Senghor's domestic political base and required a complex system of alliances with various domestic constituencies, both of which would become important as the federation progressed. Sy was arrested on election day because of some rioting, which was blamed on his party. After the elections, the assemblies of Senegal and French Sudan approved the federation and began the process of constructing a political system to unite the two colonies. That involved three different political projects with the principle of parity (even representation from both colonies) enshrined in each' a federal government, united social movements (a labour and youth movement) and a shared political party for both countries. The federal government would have a federal assembly composed of 20 members from each of the colonies (40 in total), a President (set to be elected in August 1960) and six federal ministers (with 3 from each colony). Until a president was elected, the premier of the Mali Federation was to be Ke√Øta and the vice-premier (and the person in charge of the armed forces) was to be Mamadou Dia from Senegal. Furthermore, as part of the parity principle, any legislative initiatives required a signature by both the premier (then later the president) and the minister responsible for that issue. The colonies were to share the import and export taxes raised in the port of Dakar between them to the advantage of French Sudan, which had almost a third of its 1959 budget provided by that tax income. At the same time, the Mali federation sought to create unified social organisations to facilitate the union between the countries. That involved creating labour movements and youth movements to operate at both the federal and national levels and a unified political party. The political party was the major project as the ruling parties in both colonies combined to form the Parti de la F√©d√©ration Africaine (PFA). It was organised separately from the federal government but with many of the same members and leaders. Senghor was the party president and Ke√Øta was the secretary general. In addition, to have a regional influence, Djibo Bakary of Niger and Emile Zinsou of Dahomey were named the vice-presidents of the party. As articulated at the first PFA congress in July 1959 by Senghor, it would be the single political party in the country and aim to unite across the different ethnic groups in the territory. In December 1959, France and the Mali Federation began negotiations regarding independence and sovereignty of the federation. The negotiations were formally started when French President Charles de Gaulle visited Bamako on 13 December 1959, and lasted until March 1960. Although the French had resisted the Mali Federation, but after the two countries showed willingness to remain within the French Community and the franc zone and to keep the French military bases within its territory, the French supported the formation of the federation. The negotiations agreed upon 20 June 1960 for the formal independence day of the Mali Federation. Political tension and dissolution Tensions quickly arose within the Mali Federation as planning for the implementation of the federation began in 1959 and early 1960. Unlike some other areas of French West Africa, French Sudan and Senegal did not have significant amounts of migration or intercultural movement during the colonial period (although they were linked together in French economic policy and linked by a key railway). More serious than ethnic or linguistic differences, however, were some of the results of the design of the federation. While the parity principle allowed both countries to join together without fears of losing their sovereignty, it also resulted in political spillover, as political disputes moved from one arena to another. Similarly, the PFA tried to combine two political parties, which were in very different situations with the French Sudan political party, having achieved political dominance, but the Senegal party needed an elaborate and complex arrangement of alliances to maintain authority. In addition, some of the aspects left vague in the first discussions became key issues of debate between the political leaders of Senegal and French Sudan as their articulation became more important, including armed forces, development of an indigenous bureaucracy, the strength of the federal government and the precise relationship with France. Finally, different visions for the colony between Senghor and Ke√Øta proved very difficult to mediate: Ke√Øta, after the dissolution of the federation, claimed that he pursued socialism, but Senghor pushed a bourgeoisie agenda. The disagreements remained manageable until April 1960 after negotiations with France for recognition of independence had finished. French Sudan began to push for a single executive in the federation with significant independent authority. Senegal preferred to maintain the parity principle as it had been developed in 1959 and to restrain the power of any president. When a PFA congress to decide the issue ended in a deadlock, its members from outside the federation were called in to mediate and they recommended the creation of a single executive to be appointed by an equal number of representatives from Senegal and French Sudan but also that the taxation would no longer be widely shared between the two colonies (a key Senegal position). Although that issue was resolved to the agreement of both parties, a series of misunderstandings quickly followed. When French Sudan attempted to remove a single military base within its territories, it was interpreted as an attempt to eject the French from the entire territory, which was viewed with suspicion by both Senegal and France. Tensions hit their high point in August 1960 in preparation for the election of the President of the Mali Federation. Cheikh Tidjane Sy, who had been released from prison and became a member of Senghor's political party, approached Senghor and said that he had been approached by representatives from Sudan who had expressed a preference for a Muslim president of the Mali Federation (like Sy) rather than a Catholic president (like Senghor). An investigation by Senghor's political allies found evidence that French Sudan emissaries had visited Sy's uncle, who was a Muslim political leader. About the same time, Ke√Øta, as Premier of the Mali Federation, began meeting formally with many of the Muslim political leaders of Senegal although there is no evidence of any discussion of undermining Senghor's leadership. On 15 August, Senghor, Dia, and other political leaders of Senegal began to work on how to get Senegal out of the federation. Mamadou Dia, as the vice-premier and person in charge of national defense, began surveying the readiness of various military units in case the political situation were to become hostile. Those questions to the various military units resulted in panic by Ke√Øta and the French Sudanese politicians. On 19 August, with reports of Senegalese peasants arming in Dakar, Ke√Øta dismissed Dia as the defense minister, declared a state of emergency, and mobilized the armed forces. Senghor and Dia were able to get a political ally in the military to demobilize the military and then had the national gendarmerie which surrounded Ke√Øta's house and the government offices. Senegal declared independence from the Mali Federation at a midnight session on 20 August. There was little violence and the French Sudan officials were sent on a sealed train back to Bamako on 22 August. The federation may have been salvageable in spite of the crisis but by sending Ke√Øta and the others back on a hot, sealed train during August, rather than a plane, led Ke√Øta to declare that the railroad be destroyed at the border after the trip. Independent nations of Senegal and the Republic of Mali were recognized by most countries by mid-September and accepted into the United Nations in late September 1960. Legacy Although the Mali Federation existed in name only in Bamako for another month, France and most other nations recognized the two colonies as separate independent countries on 12 September 1960. The Sudanese Union ‚Äì African Democratic Rally party in French Sudan adopted the slogan \\"Le Mali Continue\\" and at a meeting on 22 September the party decided to rename the country Mali and to sever ties with the French Community. The admission to the United Nations for both countries was delayed until late September as a result of the Mali Federation dispute. Senghor and Ke√Øta both ruled their countries at the time of the split from the Mali Federation and for a number of years: Senghor was president of Senegal from 1960 until 1980 and Ke√Øta from 1960 until 1968. Senghor suffered some domestic challenges after the split from the Mali Federation but after an armed fight between his supporters and those of Mamadou Dia's supporters in 1962, he had largely consolidated his rule. Senghor became very wary of unification efforts after the failed experiment and despite attempts to create other federations in West Africa and with Senegal's neighbors, Senghor often restrained these efforts and they only progressed after his rule. In addition, as the first failed unification experiment in Africa, the Mali Federation served as a lesson in future attempts at unification throughout the continent. Ke√Øta became more assertive with pushing his ideology after the collapse of the federation and refused diplomatic relations with Senegal for many years. Nonetheless, Mali under Ke√Øta still pursued the goal of West African unity but did so in a variety of different international connections. The railroad was reopened on 22 June 1963 and Senghor and Ke√Øta embraced at the border.

Publisher Nan Talese said that Marcellino could \\"in one image, translate the whole feeling and style of a book.\\" Such was the case with his evocative painting for Judith Rossner's August, published and edited by Talese. Among many other commissions, he was responsible for the covers of Margaret Atwood's novel The Handmaid's Tale, Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities and the 1987 Dell Laurel Leaf edition of Allen Appel's Time After Time. Early life Born in Brooklyn, Marcellino began as an abstract expressionist painter and spent 1963 studying in Venice on a Fulbright Scholarship. Returning to the United States, he went in a new direction as a designer and illustrator with the main focus on LP cover art illustrating the albums of such singers and groups as Loretta Lynn, Manhattan Transfer and Fleetwood Mac. By 1969, he was creating record album covers for Capitol, Decca and PolyGram. Book jackets He entered the book publishing field by 1974,Lookout Cartridge producing 40 jackets a year for 15 years. He is sometimes credited with having revolutionized the style of book cover design in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s with notable work on such books as Anne Tyler's Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, Charles Dickinson's Waltz in Marathon, and William Wharton's Birdy. Illustrators were sometimes presented with tip sheets suggesting pages in the manuscript the illustrator might find a suitable character or location to illustrate. Marcellino, however, insisted on reading the entire manuscript and producing a carefully designed, tasteful illustration that captured the overall mood of the book, often symbolically. Art director Steven Heller described Marcellino's approach: :His surreal landscapes, exotic backdrops, impressionist palette, and precisionist typography defined a particular kind of literary genre. By \\"defined\\" I mean Marcellino gave authors including Anne Tyler, Tom Wolfe, Milan Kundera, Judith Rossner, Margaret Atwood and Primo Levi, to name but a few, a visual persona that underscored their words and ideas. Marcellino's distinctive personal style never conflicted with the writers' character, but like the best graphic interpreters he added dimension that was not always there. He also, and perhaps most importantly, challenged the strict marketing conventions imposed on packaging fiction and non-fiction blockbusters that required gigantic type for the author's name and a small, literal illustration of the plot or theme. Although these kinds of covers grabbed attention there was little aesthetic resonance. Marcellino introduced subtly painted and smartly lettered mini- posters that established allure. He was a master of sky and many of his book jacket illustrations use rich, cloud-studded skyscapes as backdrops and dramatic light sources for effect. He typically rendered the light of early dawn and late afternoon in pastel hues and airbrush smoothness to create surreal auras. The way in which he manipulated light on such subjects as walls, chairs, and doors enabled him to transform the commonplace into charged graphic symbols.*Heller, Steven. \\"Fred Marcellino: Master of Sky,\\" Norman Rockwell Museum, 2002. Children's books In the mid-1980s, he began doing children's books, starting with Tor Seidler's A Rat's Tale. He found it to be a different experience, commenting: :Each picture is a link in a chain, and they all exist in counterpoint with the text. And although you want each picture to have impact, just like a jacket, the book illustration can also be much more subtle. It can be pondered and savored over a period of time. It's a very different discipline from what I was used to, but I must say it was love at first sight.Harper Highlights, Michael di Capua Books/HarperCollins, 1996. Charles Perrault's Puss in Boots, his first full-color picture book, won a 1991 Caldecott honor, and he won more awards with The Steadfast Tin Soldier, The Wainscott Weasel, The Pelican Chorus and Other Nonsense, The Story of Little Babaji (a revision of The Story of Little Black Sambo) and Ouch! (adapted from the Grimm tale, The Devil and His Three Golden Hairs). He moved into writing with I, Crocodile (1999), honored by The New York Times (Best Books of the Year), Publishers Weekly (Best Book of the Year), Child magazine (Best Book of the Year), The New York Times Book Review (Ten Best Illustrated Picture Books) and the ALA Notable Book. In 1998, he was diagnosed with colon cancer, and he died on July 12, 2001. At the time of his death, he was working on the I, Crocodile sequel, Arrivederci, Crocodile. In December 2016, it was announced that Arrivederci, Crocodile would be completed by the French illustrator Eric Puybaret and published in September 2019 by Atheneum.

It raised many important issues in the British constitution, particularly concerning parliamentary privilege and \\"gagging orders\\". The Zircon affair In November 1985 the Scottish investigative journalist Duncan Campbell was commissioned by BBC Scotland to present and research a six part, half-hour documentary series called Secret Society, produced by Brian Barr. GCHQ became aware that a BBC Scotland crew were filming at Menwith, and when Campbell interviewed the Ministry of Defence's former Chief Scientific Adviser Ronald Mason in August 1986 he mentioned the Zircon Project (regarded as \\"exceptionally secret\\").Nicholas Wilkinson, \\"Secrecy and the Media: The Official History of the United Kingdom's D-Notice system\\", Routledge, London, 2009, , p. 413. Campbell had planned to use an episode of Secret Society to reveal the existence of Zircon, but found while researching the programme in mid-1986 that the head of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Robert Sheldon, knew nothing of the project. The Public Accounts Committee is a select committee of the House of Commons, responsible for overseeing government expenditures. It had been agreed between Parliament and the British government that expensive military projects should be subject to scrutiny by the committee, and Campbell felt that Sheldon's ignorance of the Zircon project was evidence of the violation of this agreement. The concealment of Zircon from the committee mirrored the parliamentary secrecy over a previous defence project, the Chevaline programme to enhance the Polaris nuclear missile. The previous head of the PAC, Lord Barnett, had been recently appointed the BBC Vice-Chairman. Barnett had withdrawn from a planned interview with Campbell for the programme after his BBC appointment, upset at the nature of the questioning that Sheldon had faced, who had accused Campbell of setting him up. The Director-General of the BBC, Alasdair Milne, later wrote that the Secretary of the D-Notice Committee made \\"remonstration noises\\" after the Secret Society series was announced at the launch of BBC 2's autumn schedule. According to the official history of the D-Notice Committee, the committee's secretary Rear Admiral W. A. Higgins had been prompted solely by the appearance of the series in the BBC's autumn 1986 publicity, and was not himself then aware of the Zircon Project. A meeting of the BBC governors was held on 13 November 1986, chaired by Marmaduke Hussey. Hussey had been recommended as chairman of the BBC Board of Governors by Conservative government ministers. Opposition to Campbell from governors at the meeting came from Daphne Park, the former MI6 operative, who said that Campbell was a \\"destroyer\\" who the BBC should never have employed, and the former diplomat Curtis Keeble. Hussey subsequently expressed the negative views of the governors to Milne after the meeting. Milne met the Director of the Government Communications Headquarters, Peter Marychurch, on 5 December 1986, on the same day that Alan Protheroe, the Assistant Director-General of the BBC, had written to Milne at his home, saying that the Zircon episode should not be transmitted. Protheroe was responsible for supervising journalism at the BBC, and was the BBC's member on the D-Notice Committee. Protheroe believed that the Zircon episode would damage national security after speaking to the Ministry of Defence. Initial cuts of all six programmes in the series were then viewed by Milne, who later showed the series to the governors. The governors subsequently felt that, barring a few changes, the series would be suitable for broadcast, except for the Zircon episode. However, not all governors were as opposed to the episode as Protheroe was. The governors held two further meeting before Christmas 1986, at which Milne was \\"hounded unpleasantly over Secret Society\\". Milne finally made a decision not to broadcast the Zircon episode during the Christmas holiday. The Zircon affair was publicly revealed by The Observer on 18 January 1987, with the headline \\"BBC Gag on ¬£500m Defence secret\\". An injunction was obtained by the Attorney General on January 21 restraining Campbell from talking or writing about the contents of the episode. On 22 January, Campbell published an article in the New Statesman against which the government issued an injunction. Campbell's article was sourced to a former employee of GCHQ and four unnamed defence officials, and the Attorney General instructed police from Special Branch to find their identities to establish whether the Official Secrets Act had been breached. Under the authority of a warrant under section 9 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, Special Branch raided Campbell's London home, those of his researchers Jolyon Jenkins and Patrick Forbes, and the New Statesmans offices. In early February Strathclyde Police conducted a raid of BBC Scotland's premises in Glasgow which lasted for 28 hours on 24 January 1987. The Controller of BBC Scotland, Pat Chalmers was questioned by Special Branch police, and Protheroe was arrested and questioned by the Strathclyde police. The matter now becoming public knowledge, opposition MP Robin Cook managed to obtain a video of the Zircon documentary and arranged a showing of it to MPs in the House of Commons. The Attorney General, Sir Michael Havers, sought an injunction in the High Court to prevent the video's showing, but the application was dismissed on the basis of parliamentary privilege. Frustrated, the Attorney General organised a briefing on the matter for the Speaker of the House of Commons, Bernard Weatherill, based on confidentiality stemming from their common membership of the Privy Council. That day, the Speaker ruled that no part of the Palace of Westminster was to be used for the showing of the video, pending a report by the Committee of Privileges. There was much political consternation at the ruling. With the help of sympathetic MPs Campbell tried to privately screen the programme in the House of Commons, though all BBC staff had been ordered to return copies of the programme. The Zircon project fell under the remit of the Defence Select Committee, who wished to see the episode, but were opposed by a civil servant from the Ministry of Defence. The dispute was ruled upon by the Speaker, who ruled that the episode could not be shown on the parliamentary site, it was instead screened nearby. The governors remained in a state of disquiet, with Hussey complaining to Milne that the episode should never have been made. Hussey and the Board of Governors demanded Milne's resignation on 29 January. However, by this time, copies of the video had been obtained by various civil liberties organisations, which arranged public showings around the UK. The government was now placed in a difficult situation. The Attorney General stayed his hand and the matter soon faded in the public interest. The Committee of Privileges subsequently recommended that showing the video would fall outside proceedings in parliament and was, therefore, not protected by privilege. They further recommended that the Speaker's actions had been wholly proper. = Cabinet episode = The sixth episode of the Secret Society series was titled Cabinet, and focused on secret Cabinet committees. It was also held back from broadcast, and has not, , ever been shown. The broadcast of the Cabinet episode was cancelled due to the imminent 1987 general election. The BBC subsequently rejected Campbell's attempt to buy the episode for broadcast on Channel 4 in 1991, in a season of programming about censorship. Instead the episode was remade using Campbell's scripts. In a parliamentary debate on civil liberties and the Bill of Rights on 15 June 1989, Labour MP Alistair Darling, then in opposition, claimed that the true reason for the Zircon affair was to distract from the Cabinet episode of Secret Society. Darling said that \\"The Government's actions are oppressive, as has been shown by their treatment of broadcasting. We saw the spectacle of police being sent to raid the BBC headquarters in Glasgow in the middle of the night. ... We saw the Zircon tapes seized as an elaborate blind.\\" Darling said that the cabinet episode concerned \\"the election campaign of 1983, and the fact that the Government sought to undermine and spy on the citizens of this country. Their object was to prevent the programme from being shown, and the Zircon affair was a blind.\\"  See also  * BBC controversies  Footnotes   Bibliography  Bradley, A. W.

William Croft (baptised 30 December 1678 ‚Äì 14 August 1727) was an English composer and organist. Life Croft was born at the Manor House, Nether Ettington, Warwickshire. He was educated at the Chapel Royal under the instruction of John Blow, and remained there until 1698. Two years after this departure, he became organist of St. Anne's Church, Soho and he became an organist and 'Gentleman extraordinary' at the Chapel Royal. He shared that post with his friend Jeremiah Clarke.John Calvert Dennis Shrock In 1707, he took over the Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal post, which had been left vacant by the suicide of Jeremiah Clarke. The following year, Croft succeeded Blow (who had lately died) as organist of Westminster Abbey. He composed works for the funeral of Queen Anne (1714) and for the coronation of King George I (1715). In 1724, Croft published Musica Sacra, a collection of church music, the first such collection to be printed in the form of a score. It contains a Burial Service, which may have been written for Queen Anne or for the Duke of Marlborough.Spink (1995), p. 183 Shortly afterwards his health deteriorated, and he died while visiting Bath. One of Croft's most enduring pieces is the hymn tune \\"St Anne\\" written to the poem Our God, Our Help in Ages Past by Isaac Watts. Other composers subsequently incorporated the tune in their own works. Handel used it, for instance, in an anthem entitled O Praise the Lord and also Hubert Parry in his 1911 Coronation Te Deum.Range, Matthias (2012), Music and Ceremonial at British Coronations: From James I to Elizabeth II Cambridge University Press, (p. 241) Bach's Fugue in E-flat major BWV 552 is often called the \\"St. Anne\\", due to the similarity (coincidental in this case) of its subject to the hymn melody's first phrase. Croft also wrote various violin sonatas, which are not nearly as often performed as is his religious music, but have been occasionally recorded. Perhaps Croft's most notable legacy is the suite of Funeral Sentences which have been described as a \\"glorious work of near genius\\". First published as part of the Burial Service in Musica Sacra, the date and purpose of their composition is uncertain. The seven Sentences themselves are from the Book of Common Prayer and are verses from various books of the Bible, intended to be said or sung during an Anglican funeral. One of the sentences, Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts, was not composed by Croft, but by Henry Purcell, part of his 1695 Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary. Croft wrote: Croft's Funeral Sentences were sung at George Frederic Handel's funeral in 1759,Burrows, Donald (2012) Handel, Oxford University Press, (p. 327) and have been included in every British state funeral since their publication.

A flat (short for scenery flat) or coulisse is a flat piece of theatrical scenery which is painted and positioned on stage so as to give the appearance of buildings or other background. Flats can be soft covered (covered with cloth such as muslin) or hard covered (covered with decorative plywood such as luan). Soft-covered flats have changed little from their origin in the Italian Renaissance. Flats with a frame that places the width of the lumber parallel to the face are called \\"Broadway\\" or \\"stage\\" flats. Hard-covered flats with a frame that is perpendicular to the paint surface are referred to as \\"Hollywood\\" or \\"studio\\" flats. Usually flats are built in standard sizes of , , or tall so that walls or other scenery may easily be constructed, and so that flats may be stored and reused for subsequent productions. Often affixed to battens flown in from the fly tower or loft for the scenes in which they are used, they may also be stored at the sides of the stage, called wings, and braced to the floor when in use for an entire performance. Flat construction A scenic painter at work at the Semperoper in Dresden, Germany. =Parts of a flat= Rails (or plates) are the top and bottom framing members of a flat. Rails run the full width of the flat (, for a , flat). Stiles (or studs) are the vertical members of the frame. The length of the stiles is the full height of the flat, minus the combined width of the rails (, for a , flat constructed of , rails). Toggles are horizontal cross pieces that run between the stiles or studs. The number and placement of toggles depends on the type of flat. The length of the toggles is the total width of the flat minus the combined width of the stiles (, for a , soft-cover flat constructed of , stiles). Corner blocks are used to join the corners of a soft-cover flat. They are normally made of plywood, and are triangles with corners of 45¬∞, 45¬∞, and 90¬∞. They are most often made by ripping the plywood at and then mitering it at 45 degree angles to create triangles with legs. Keystones join the toggles to the stiles of soft-cover flats. They are long, and normally rip sawn to the same width as the toggles (usually ) on one end, and on the other, forming a shape similar to the keystone of an archway. Straps can be used in place of keystones. They are long and wide (same as toggle) rectangles. They are easier to construct than keystones, but not as strong due to their narrower dimension and reduced glue/nailing surface area. A coffin lock or screws may be used to join securely adjacent flats, or traditionally with a lash line cleat, where cotton sash cord is lashed around cleats installed on the flat's edges. This allows for quick standing and striking of the set. =Styles= Broadway or stage flats are generally constructed of nominal ( actual) pine boards. The boards are laid out flat on the shop floor, squared, and joined with the keystones and corner blocks. The keystones and corner blocks are inset from the outside edge, which allows for flats to be hinged or butted together. They are then glued in place, and stapled or screwed down. The flat can then be flipped over and covered with muslin or decorative plywood. Toggles in a Broadway flat are placed on centers. Broadway flats can also be constructed using Half-lap and Cross-lap joints instead of keystones and corner blocks, and joins stiles, rails, and toggles, by sawing a deep half-lap at the ends of the pieces, and/or a deep dado groove mid-piece, which are then glued and stapled together. Dados can be made using a radial arm saw or table saw, and a dado stack cutter (two outer circular saw blades and one or more \\"chippers\\" between them, giving a much wider cut). Setting up for a dado stack is approximately the same as for preparing keystones and cornerblocks, but requires less layout, as the length of stiles, rails and, toggles are equal to the face of your flat. Hollywood or studio flats can be made in various thicknesses to suit a particular design, but are most often made of nominal ( actual) pine boards. The boards are laid out on edge on the shop floor, the ends are glued together and stapled or screwed. Keystones and corner blocks are not normally used. Once assembled, the flat can be covered with or decorative plywood, which is glued on and stapled. The toggles in a Hollywood flat are placed on centers. Hollywood flats may receive a muslin skin over the decorative plywood face. The face is covered in a mixture of water and white glue, the muslin is applied and the entire flat is covered with the water/glue mixture again, to shrink and attach the muslin.

Discovered in 1997, it can result in the processor ceasing to function until the computer is physically rebooted. The bug has been circumvented through operating system updates. The name is shorthand for \`F0 0F C7 C8\`, the hexadecimal encoding of one offending instruction. More formally, the bug is called the invalid operand with locked CMPXCHG8B instruction bug. The opening to this specification update reads: Description In the x86 architecture, the byte sequence \`F0 0F C7 C8\` represents the instruction \`lock cmpxchg8b eax\` (locked compare and exchange of 8 bytes in register EAX). The bug also applies to opcodes ending in \`C9\` through \`CF\`, which specify register operands other than EAX. The \`F0 0F C7 C8\` instruction does not require any special privileges. This instruction encoding is invalid. The \`cmpxchg8b\` instruction compares the value in the EDX and EAX registers (the lower halves of RDX and RAX on more modern x86 processors) with an 8-byte value in a memory location. In this case, however, a register is specified instead of a memory location, which is not allowed. Under normal circumstances, this would simply result in an exception; however, when used with the lock prefix (normally used to prevent two processors from interfering with the same memory location), the CPU erroneously uses locked bus cycles to read the illegal instruction exception-handler descriptor. Locked reads must be paired with locked writes, and the CPU's bus interface enforces this by forbidding other memory accesses until the corresponding writes occur. As none are forthcoming, after performing these bus cycles all CPU activity stops, and the CPU must be reset to recover. Due to the proliferation of Intel microprocessors, the existence of this open-privilege instruction was considered a serious issue at the time. Operating system vendors responded by implementing workarounds that detected the condition and prevented the crash. Information about the bug first appeared on the Internet on or around 8 November 1997. Since the F00F bug has become common knowledge, the term is sometimes used to describe similar hardware design flaws such as the Cyrix coma bug. No permanent hardware damage results from executing the F00F instruction on a vulnerable system; it simply locks up until rebooted. However, data loss of unsaved data is likely if the disk buffers have not been flushed, if drives were interrupted during a write operation, or if some other non-atomic operation was interrupted. The B2 stepping solved this issue for Intel's Pentium processors. The F00F instruction can be considered an example of a Halt and Catch Fire (HCF) instruction. Workarounds Although a definite solution to this problem required some sort of hardware/firmware revision, there were proposed workarounds at the time which prevented the exploitation of this issue in generating a denial-of-service attack on the affected machine. All of them were based on forcefully breaking up the pattern of faulty bus accesses responsible for the processor hang. Intel's proposed (therefore \\"official\\") solutions required setting up the table of interrupt descriptors in an unnatural way that forced the processor to issue an intervening page fault before it could access the memory containing the descriptor for the undefined-opcode exception. These extraneous memory accesses turned out to be sufficient for the bus interface to let go of the locking requirement that was the root cause for the bug. Specifically, the table of interrupt descriptors, which normally resides on a single memory page, is instead split over two pages such that the descriptors for the first seven exception handlers reside on a page, and the remainder of the table on the following page. The handler for the undefined opcode exception is then the last descriptor on the first page, while the handler for the page-fault exception resides on the second page. The first page can now be made not- present (usually signifying a page that has been swapped out to disk to make room for some other data), which will force the processor to fetch the descriptor for the page-fault exception handler. This descriptor, residing on the second page of the table, is present in memory as usual (if it weren't, the processor would double- and then triple-fault, leading to a shutdown). These extra memory cycles override the memory locking requirement issued by the original illegal instruction (since faulting instructions are supposed to be able to be restarted after the exception handler returns). The handler for the page-fault exception has to be modified, however, to cope with the necessity of providing the missing page for the first half of the interrupt descriptor table, a task it isn't usually required to perform. The second official workaround from Intel proposed keeping all pages present in memory, but marking the first page read-only. Since the originating illegal instruction was supposed to issue a memory write cycle, this is enough for again forcing the intervention of the page-fault handler. This variant has the advantage that the modifications required to the page-fault handler are very minor compared to the ones required for the first variant; it basically just needs to redirect to the undefined-exception handler when appropriate. However, this variant requires that the operating system itself be prevented from writing to read-only pages (through the setting of a global processor flag), and not all kernels are designed this way; more recent kernels in fact are, since this is the same basic mechanism used for implementing copy-on- write. Additional workarounds other than the official ones from Intel have been proposed; in many cases these proved as effective and much easier to implement. The simplest one involved merely marking the page containing interrupt descriptors as non-cacheable. Again, the extra memory cycles that the processor was forced to go through to fetch data from RAM every time it needed to invoke an exception handler appeared to be all that was needed to prevent the processor from locking up. In this case, no modification whatsoever to any exception handler was required. And, although not strictly necessary, the same split of the interrupt descriptor table was performed in this case, with only the first page marked non-cacheable. This was for performance reasons, as the page containing most of the descriptors (and the ones more often required, in fact) could stay in cache. For unknown reasons, these additional, unofficial workarounds were never endorsed by Intel. It might be that it was suspected that they might not work with all affected processor versions.

As surprising as it might seem, some of these mountains are high enough, cold enough, and wet enough in the wintertime to provide alpine skiing at regular ski resorts, with ski lifts, not very distant from cities such as Tucson. Transportation Significant distances requiring transportation in Southern Arizona are generally traveled by highway and the railroad. Southern Arizona is the location of the major transcontinental Interstate highway Interstate 10 from the border with New Mexico westward through Tucson, and then continuing northwest via Casa Grande to the Phoenix‚ÄìScottsdale‚ÄìMesa metropolis. Also, running westward from Casa Grande is Interstate 8, which goes via Yuma into California, crossing the Colorado River. Finally, the short Interstate 19 runs south from Tucson to Nogales, Arizona, and a major border crossing into Mexico. In addition, the much older Federal highway, U.S. Route 80, crosses Southern Arizona from east to west from the New Mexico border, nearly to the California border, and formerly into California to the Pacific Ocean. However, its westernmost stretch has been replaced by Interstate 8, which was built on top of it and its right-of-way. A Transcontinental Railroad crosses Southern Arizona via Tucson and Phoenix. Also, there is a major railroad south from Northern Arizona, via Phoenix, Casa Grande, and Tucson, to Nogales, where it crosses the border and meets the Mexican railroads. As for airline transportation, the primary major airport of Southern Arizona is located in Tucson. Tucson International Airport , is located just south of Tucson. History Stone Avenue in the year 1880 in Tucson, southern Arizona's largest city Southern Arizona has been inhabited by human beings for several millennia. The Hohokam were the principal Pre-Columbian inhabitants of the area. In more recent times, the dominant indigenous group of Native Americans have been the O'odham tribe, which continues to reside in this area in their traditional homeland. Several Spanish missions were established in the early 18th century by Father Eusebio Francisco Kino in what was then known as the Pimer√≠a Alta. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì47, much of Southern Arizona was purchased by the United States from Mexico for $15,000,000 in the Gadsden Purchase of 1854. More recently, Southern Arizona played an important role during the Cold War. Davis-Monthan AFB was the home base of an air force wing of 18 heavy Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles dispersed over a wide area of launch sites ‚Äì south, southwest, and southeast of Tucson. About 20 years ago, due to their advancing age and the advent of several important Strategic Nuclear Weapons Reduction treaties, all of these missiles were retired from service. All but one of their launch silos and command shelters were demolished with explosives. The remaining site, Titan II ICBM Site 571-7, about 15 miles south of Tucson on Interstate 19, serves as the Titan Missile Museum, a National Historic Landmark. Secession Beginning in 1987, a group of southern Arizonans have considered seceding from the rest of Arizona to form a new U.S. state, potentially named Baja Arizona or Gadsden. A political push to that effect began in February, 2011, led by a group of attorneys largely in opposition to what they perceived as a nativist, conservative dominance in the Phoenix area in contrast to the Democrats of the south. The organizers of this movement had aimed to hold a referendum vote on the matter in 2012 in Pima County (and, possibly, Santa Cruz County and Cochise County). , no ballot initiatives had been generated.

It was invented and brought to market by Natural Microsystems Inc (now BPQ Communicationser). Used to build call center equipment using regular PCs, MVIP provides a second communications bus within the computer that can multiplex up to 256 full-duplex voice channels from one voice card to another. Digital voice, fax and video is bussed over a ribbon cable connected at the top of each ISA or PCI card. MVIP products make a PC perform like a small-scale PBX. The protocol accommodated for a variety of expansion boards, including trunk interfaces (usually T1 or ISDN), voice processing boards equipment speech recognition or fax processing. Each board could optionally provide a switch that could interconnect voice channels on the bus, allowing for a flexible routing of calls within the MVIP bus. The MVIP bus was promoted as an alternative to the then-dominant PEB bus by Dialogic Corporation which had much less capacity and was not an open standard.

It is part of an external analysis when conducting a strategic analysis or doing market research, and gives an overview of the different macro-environmental factors to be taken into consideration. It is a strategic tool for understanding market growth or decline, business position, potential and direction for operations. Variants that build on the PEST framework include: * PESTEL or PESTLE, which adds legal and environmental factors. * SLEPT, adding legal factors. * STEPE, adding ecological factors.Richardson, J. A Brief Intellectual History of the STEPE Model or Framework (i.e., the Social, Technical, Economic, Political, and Ecological), accessed 6 May 2019 * STEEPLE and STEEPLED, adding ethics and demographic factors (occasionally rendered as PESTLEE).Mason, L.

(2011), Comparison of the STEEPLE Strategy Methodology and the Department of Defense‚Äôs PMESII-PT Methodology, Supply Chain Leadership Institute, accessed 10 February 2019 There is also STEER, which considers sociocultural, technological, economic, ecological, and regulatory factors, but does not specifically include political factors.  Composition  The basic PEST analysis includes four factors: * Political factors relate to how the government intervenes in the economy. Specifically, political factors have areas including tax policy, labour law, environmental law, trade restrictions, tariffs, and political stability. Political factors may also include goods and services which the government aims to provide or be provided (merit goods) and those that the government does not want to be provided (demerit goods or merit bads). Furthermore, governments have a high impact on the health, education, and infrastructure of a nation. * Economic factors include economic growth, exchange rates, inflation rate, and interest rates. These factors greatly affect how businesses operate and make decisions. For example, interest rates affect a firm's cost of capital and therefore to what extent a business grows and expands. Exchange rates can affect the costs of exporting goods and the supply and price of imported goods in an economy. * Social factors include the cultural aspects and health consciousness, population growth rate, age distribution, career attitudes and emphasis on safety. High trends in social factors affect the demand for a company's products and how that company operates. For example, the ageing population may imply a smaller and less-willing workforce (thus increasing the cost of labour). Furthermore, companies may change various management strategies to adapt to social trends caused from this (such as recruiting older workers). * Technological factors include technological aspects like R&D; activity, automation, technology incentives and the rate of technological change. These can determine barriers to entry, minimum efficient production level and influence the outsourcing decisions. Furthermore, technological shifts would affect costs, quality, and lead to innovation. Expanding the analysis to PESTLE or PESTEL adds: * Legal factors include discrimination law, consumer law, antitrust law, employment law, and health and safety law. These factors can affect how a company operates, its costs, and the demand for its products. * Environmental factors include ecological and environmental aspects such as weather, climate, and climate change, which may especially affect industries such as tourism, farming, and insurance. Furthermore, growing awareness of the potential impacts of climate change is affecting how companies operate and the products they offer, both creating new markets and diminishing or destroying existing ones. Other factors for the various offshoots include: * Demographic factors include gender, age, ethnicity, knowledge of languages, disabilities, mobility, home ownership, employment status, religious belief or practice, culture and tradition, living standards and income level. * Regulatory factors include acts of parliament and associated regulations, international and national standards, local government by-laws, and mechanisms to monitor and ensure compliance with these. More factors discussed in the SPELIT Power Matrix include: * Inter-cultural factors considers collaboration in a global setting. * Other specialized factors discussed in chapter 10 of the SPELIT Power Matrix include the Ethical, Educational, Physical, Religious, and Security environments. The security environment may include either personal, company, or national security. * Other business-related factors that might be considered in an environmental analysis include Competition, Demographics, Ecological, Geographical, Historical, Organizational, and Temporal (schedule).Schmieder-Ramirez, J. and Mallette, L., Using the SPELIT Analysis Technique for Organizational Transitions, Chapter 28 of \\"Education Applications and Developments\\" edited by Mafalda Carmo, Science Press, 2015 Retrieved 2015-08-21.  Applicability of the factors  The model's factors will vary in importance to a given company based on its industry and the goods it produces. For example, consumer and B2B companies tend to be more affected by the social factors, while a global defense contractor would tend to be more affected by political factors. Additionally, factors that are more likely to change in the future or more relevant to a given company will carry greater importance. For example, a company which has borrowed heavily will need to focus more on the economic factors (especially interest rates). Furthermore, conglomerate companies who produce a wide range of products (such as Sony, Disney, or BP) may find it more useful to analyze one department of its company at a time with the PESTEL model, thus focusing on the specific factors relevant to that one department. A company may also wish to divide factors into geographical relevance, such as local, national, and global.

The municipality covers an area of 81.79 square kilometres comprising 4% of the island's area. The town Arona is 59 km southwest from Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the island's capital. The population in 2017 was about 93,496. It is the third largest city in Tenerife, after, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna. Arona has a pleasant climate with temperatures ranging from 20 to 25 degrees Celsius. Notable places include the tourist resorts of Los Cristianos, Playa de las Americas, Costa del Silencio and Las Galletas. Arona also features Punta Salemas, the southernmost point of the island of Tenerife. The TF-1 motorway passes through the municipality. History The area was sparsely populated in the initial centuries since the settlement of the island. While Viera y Clavijo mentioned a small village of the same name in an early work on the islands, a church was not built until the 17th century and this church did not obtain the status of a parish church until March 1796. The economy until the twentieth century was based on fishing and agriculture including cochineal, bananas and cattle. There was also a small quarry in the fishing village of Los Cristianos in the nineteenth century. In the first half of the twentieth century, the population grew slowly despite a slump in cochineal prices, a general decline in farming and the Spanish Civil War. However, the economy and population has grown rapidly in recent years as it has become a popular tourist destination. The population has grown from 13,556 in 1981 to 28,208 in 1996. The 2005 population has finally reached over 60,000. In contrast, the municipality had a population of approximately 2,000 in 1901. The tourism industry employs 60% of the workforce. Since 2015, the town of Los Cristianos in Arona is the headquarters of the Islamic Federation of the Canary Islands, which is the organization that brings together associations and Muslim communities of the Canary Islands.Los musulmanes de la Isla constituyen la primera Federaci√≥n Isl√°mica de Canarias Education Wingate School, a British international school, is in Arona.\\"Home page.\\" Wingate School.

The AAA was founded 23 April 1995. Although many of their activities were reported as serious participation in conferences or protests against the militarization of space, some were also considered art pranks, media pranks, or elaborate spoof. The AAA had numerous local chapters which operated independently of one another, with the AAA effectively operating as a collective pseudonym along the lines of Luther Blissett (nom de plume). Sztuka Fabryka is a worldwide non-profit artists organisation based in Belgium. The Association's ostensible five-year mission, a reference to Star Trek, was to \\"establish a planetary network to end the monopoly of corporations, governments and the military over travel in space\\". Artists who became involved were often connected to the zine scene or mail art movements. The five-year mission's completion was marked at the 2000 Fortean Times conference. Some chapters have continued activities to the present day. Several AAAers have experienced zero-gravity training flights. The writer Tom Hodgkinson described participants as \\"a loose bunch of Marxists, futurists, and revolutionaries on the dole\\", going on to explicate their mission as \\"reclaim[ing] the idea of space travel for the common man\\". To the AAA, he said, \\"space travel represented an ideal of freedom\\". Hodgkinson is editor of The Idler. Annick Bureaud of Leonardo/OLATS viewed their work as \\"space art\\" that \\"combine[d] freely space, cyberspace, raves, esoteric things, techno-music, etc.\\", calling attention to \\"how they recycle ... key images (the MIR Space Station, the astronauts on the Moon, etc.) ... mixed with science-fiction (and specially Star Trek) buzz-words or images\\" and then subjected these \\"sacred icons\\" to \\"iconoclastic treatments\\". From the proceedings of the Rencontres du 13 avril interdisciplinary conference. Via the Internet Archive. In his book Unleashing the Collective Phantoms, the theorist Brian Holmes said of the AAA: \\"The ideas sound fantastic, but the stakes are real: imagining a political subject within the virtual class, and therefore, within the economy of cultural production and intellectual property that had paralyzed the poetics of resistance.\\" \\"Unleashing the Collective Phantoms\\", Brian Holmes, Autonomedia, 2008 The London chapter participated in the J18 Carnival Against Capitalism protests during that year's G8 summit, with a contingent of AAA members dressed in space suits delivering a petition against the militarisation of space to the headquarters of Lockheed. The group was particularly concerned about the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft and its RTG power source performing an earth fly-by to boost its speed toward the outer Solar System.

It is based on the 1999 novel Silmido by Baek Dong-ho,Choi, Bo-sik (15 January 2004). \\"A Safecracker Who Stole the Box Office\\". The Chosun Ilbo. Retrieved 8 December 2018. which in turn is based on the true story of Unit 684. Some parts of the film are dramatizations, as the actual details of certain events remain unknown. The film was both critically well received and a financial success, and was the first film in South Korea to attract a box office audience of over 10 million viewers. Plot On 21 January 1968, 31 North Korean commandos of Unit 124 are shown to have infiltrated South Korea in a failed mission to assassinate President Park Chung-hee. As a means of retaliation, the Republic of Korea Armed Forces assembled a team of 31 social outcasts including criminals on death row and life imprisonment, in a plot to kill Kim Il-sung. The team is designated 'Unit 684'. The recruits are taken to the island of Silmido for training. The mission is offered to the recruits as the only way to redeem themselves and show their loyalty to their country. If they succeed, they will win their freedom and a new life. With this goal in mind, they endure their training. The training is shown over several months, with the recruits enduring various forms of extremely vigorous training and regular physical punishment, including being branded. One recruit is killed after he falls from a ropes course. At the end of their training, they are dispatched on their mission to North Korea, but are recalled not long after their departure. It is revealed that the project has been called off, as the government attempts a peaceful reconciliation with the North. The recruits return to Silmido discouraged and frustrated. Shortly afterwards two of the Unit 684 members escape from their barracks and rape a female doctor. They are quickly discovered, and believing that they will be executed, decide to commit suicide. One kills the other at his request but is apprehended before he is able to kill himself. The apprehended soldier is then returned to the camp, tied up, and made to watch his fellow Unit 684 members being beaten by the guards for the two men's betrayal. Enraged, one of the Unit 684 members being beaten is able to take his guard's bat and kills the tied up soldier for bringing disgrace to the unit. To keep the plot to kill Kim Il-sung unknown to the outside world, the South Korean Central Intelligence Agency decide to kill all the members of Unit 684. The unit's commander protests, but is told that if his troops failed to follow this order, they too would be killed alongside Unit 684. Torn between his duty to follow orders and his personal honor, the commander intentionally leaks this information to one of the Unit 684 members. The Unit, realizing they are going to be killed that same night, make plans to mutiny. They attack and kill the majority of their guards, and find out from one of the guards that they legally no longer exist, and never would have received recognition for their mission if it succeeded, nor even be allowed to return to society. They decide to escape from the island and make their story known. The 20 remaining members of Unit 684 capture a bus containing civilians and head to Seoul. An official pronouncement is heard over the radio that 20 \\"armed communist agents\\" have infiltrated the country, and a state of emergency is declared. After charging through one army roadblock and winning a firefight they are eventually stopped and surrounded by soldiers in front of the Yuhan Corporation building in Dongjak District, Seoul. A firefight ensues, with the Republic of Korea Army showing no regard for the welfare of the civilians on board the bus. Most of the Unit 684 members are either killed or wounded, and many South Korean soldiers are also killed. To avoid further bloodshed, the surviving Unit 684 members release the civilian hostages, before committing suicide using their own hand grenades. An investigation into the incident is shown to have been carried out; however the report is not read and is seen to be filed away in storage. Production Filming took place mainly in South Korea, but underwater and winter training scenes were filmed in Malta and New Zealand, respectively. Reception Silmido was well received by audiences in South Korea, where it was viewed by over 6 million people in its first 26 days, taking in over US$30 million in South Korea during this time alone. Silmido would also gross US$4,540,528 in Japan, as well as US$298,347 from its limited release in the United States. Silmido would go on to become the first film to have a box office audience of over 10 million in South Korea, and held the record for the most viewed film in theatres until the release of Taegukgi in 2004, which received 11.74 million viewings.

The release of this film brought public attention to Unit 684, and in 2006 the South Korean Ministry of National Defense released an official report on the unit and the uprising, officially acknowledging its existence for the first time. Brigadier General Nam Dae-yeon said that the 31 Silmido recruits who made up Unit 684 were part of a Republic of Korea Air Force squadron. Seven died in training and 20 were killed in the uprising. The four who survived were executed after a military trial in 1972. Nam stated that documents describing Unit 684's mission no longer exist, but the government has not denied that its mission was to kill Kim Il-sung. What actually caused the uprising on August 23, 1971, is unclear. The film shows the government deciding that the recruits had to be killed because they knew too much. The recruits find out and revolt. Jonathan Kim, the film's producer, acknowledges that history is unclear at this point. Six guards survived the Silmido uprising. One of the guards, Yang Dong Su, confirmed that the unit's mission had been to infiltrate North Korea and kill Kim Il-sung. Yang stated that though the film portrays the 31 recruits as death-row inmates, most were petty criminals. Yang stated that \\"They were the kind who would get into street fights a lot\\". Yang also gives his version of why the uprising occurred. On May 19, 2010, the Seoul Central District Court ordered that the government pay 273 million won in compensation to the families of 21 members of Unit 684. The court found that \\"the Silmido agents were not informed of the level of danger involved with their training, and the harshness of the training violated their basic human rights\\" and also acknowledged the emotional pain the government caused by not officially disclosing the agents‚Äô deaths to family members until 2006.

The system was designed by NPO Novator and produced by Kalinin Machine Building Plant. Its GRAU designation is \\"2K11.\\" Its NATO reporting name is SA-4 Ganef, after a word of Yiddish origin meaning \\"thief\\" or \\"rascal.\\"  Development and service  Development of the Krug ZRK-SD (2K11) air defense system started in 1957 by the Lyulev OKB design bureau. It was first displayed during a parade in Moscow in May 1965. The system started to be fielded in 1967 and became fully operational in 1969. It was used by the Soviet Army as a long-range SAM. The early version of the Krug entered service in 1965. The first operational deployment version, the Krug-A, entered service in 1967, with extensively modified versions, the Krug-M in 1971 and the Krug-M1 in 1974, which were developed to rectify problems discovered during army service. The upgraded version Krug-M was fielded in 1971 and the Krug-M1 in 1974. A target drone called 9M316M Virazh, developed from obsolete Krug missiles, was proposed for export in 1994.Boris Dukhov, Anatoly Shiroky, Building combat skills , Military Parade The 2K11 was briefly operated by the Soviet army during the war in Afghanistan in 1979 and 1980, but was withdrawn several months after the initial invasion.Urban, Mark. War in Afghanistan, 43, 66. In 1997, it was reported that, between 1993 and 1996, some 27 fire units of Krug and 349 missiles had been sold to Armenia. Poland flight tested four missiles in September 2006 against P-15 Termit (SS-N-2 'Styx') targets. The P-40 \\"Long Track\\" radar set.  Description  = Vehicles = The TEL vehicles are tracked based on a GM-123 chassis and carry two missiles each on an elevating turntable for up to 360-degree rotation and 70-degree elevation. The two primary versions of the missile in service are the 9M8M1 (former designation 3M8M1) (2K11M \\"Krug-M\\") and 9M8M2 (former designation 3M8M2) (2K11M2/3 \\"Krug-M1\\"), both of which are believed to be known to the US DoD as SA-4B. The original 9M8 (former designation 3M8) (SA-4A) was first introduced into service in 1965 and followed by the upgraded 9M8M (2K11A \\"Krug-A\\") in 1967 before the 9M8M1 in 1971 and the 9M8M2 in 1973. The 9M8M2 actually has a lower maximum engagement altitude and shorter range in exchange for better performance in engaging aircraft close to the battery. Each battery typically consists of two 9M8M1 missiles and four 9M8M2 missiles as well as the following radars: * P-40 \\"Long Track\\" (1S12) E-band early warning radar (also used by the 2K12 Kub and 9K33 Osa, range 175 km/108 miles) (modified AT-Ts), in divisions command post * 1S32 \\"Pat Hand\\" H-band continuous wave fire control and guidance radar (range 128 km/80 miles) * PRV-9 \\"Thin Skin\\" E-band height finding radar (also used by the 2K12 Kub and 9K33 Osa, range 240 km/148 miles), in regiments or brigades command post Only \\"Long Track\\" is mounted on a modified AT-T vehicle, TEL 2P24 and \\"Pat Hand\\" 1S32 are mounted on GM-123/ GM-124. \\"Thin Skin\\" is mounted on a truck. Batteries may also feature Ural 375D trucks 2T6 carrying spare missiles for reloading the launchers. = Missile = The missiles are launched with the aid of four solid fuel rocket motors inside boosters attached to the outside of the missile. Once they have burned and the missile is aloft, a liquid- fuelled ramjet sustainer engine is ignited. It reaches speeds of up to Mach 4 and has an effective range of 50‚Äì55 km (31‚Äì34 miles) depending upon the version. It carries a 135 kg (300 lb) fragmentation warhead. Possible engagement altitudes range from 100 m to 27 km (330-88,500 feet). The 3M8 missile was designed and produced by NPO Novator. Optical tracking is possible for guidance in a heavy ECM environment. = Survivability and anti-jamming capabilities = The Krug had several features that improved the survivability of the radar against anti-radiation missiles. In PI mode (–ü–ò) the system only briefly illuminated the target and the computer calculated its prolonged path based on data received from early warning radars. After a longer passive period the main radar illuminated the calculated flight direction of the target for a few seconds and recalculate path of the target if necessary (if the distance between the calculated track and the actual position is greater than 7 km). As a result, the system emitted detectable signals only for a few seconds every few minutes, making it difficult to jam or launch an anti-radar missile against the Krug. The system was also able to track the target in full-passive automated PNS (–üHC) mode based on the data provided by \\"Long Track\\" mobile EWR via radio datalink. In this mode it was almost impossible to detect the Krug system until the moment of missile launch, because Krug did not emit radiation at all. In 3M mode (3m aka three-point) the krug track on jamming signal emitting container (e.g., AN/ALQ-99). So the jamming signal that supposed to protect the aircraft made it to a target.

He also headed the Committee for the Salvation of the Fatherland after the February Uprising for 40 days in 1921. Biography After education at Armenian and Russian schools, he joined the Dashnak party. He received further education at the Gevorgian seminary in Echmiadzin from 1900 to 1906. Vratsian returned to Nor Nakhichevan as a Dashnak party worker and took part in the 4th general congress of Dashnaktsutiun at Vienna in 1907; where he supported the adoption of socialism. In 1908 he traveled to St. Petersburg to study law and education. He travelled to the United States in 1911 where he edited the Hairenik newspaper. In 1914 he made his way to the 8th general congress of Dashnaktsutiun in Ottoman Empire. He was elected to the party's Bureau and mixed with the leaders of the Young Turks. In August 1914 he was jailed as a Russian spy but escaped to Transcaucasia, where he became involved with the Armenian volunteer units who fought with the Russian army. After the disbandment of the units, he attended the Moscow state conference, the Armenian National Congress, and was elected a member of the National Council. Hovhannes Katchaznouni asked him to accompany him on his tour of Europe and America in 1919, but he was refused a visa by the British as they saw him as a radical socialist. In the same year he was appointed to ministry of labour, agriculture and state positions in Alexander Khatisian's Cabinet. His positions carried over to the government of Hamo Ohanjanyan; he also assumed responsibilities for information and propaganda. After the resignation of the government and the failure of Hovhannes Katchaznouni to form a coalition, Vratsian accepted post of Prime Minister on 23 November 1920. On 2 December he handed over Armenia to the Bolsheviks. He subsequently went into hiding, and later emerged as President of the Committee for the Salvation of the Fatherland. He also was President of the short-lived Republic of Armenia after a revolution against the Bolsheviks in February 1921. However, this second republic only lasted around 40 days; he then escaped to Persia with his bodyguards and aides, leaving his wife and child with American Near East Relief worker Dr. Clarence Ussher. He also appealed to Europe and Turkey for assistance against the Bolsheviks. Vratsian then travelled over Europe, settling in Paris to edit the Droshak from 1923 to 1925. In 1945 he presented a petition to the UN General Assembly at San Francisco demanding the restoration of Wilsonian Armenia held by Turkey to Armenia. During his lifetime he edited various now defunct Armenian periodicals and newspapers, including Harach and Horizon.  Quotes   Personal Details  Simon Vratsian (born Simon Grouzian) was born in Metz Sala, Nor Nakhichevan, Russian Empire (now Nakhichevan-on-Don) in 1882. In his memoirs, he explains that his first surname, Grouzian, came from the Armenian word \\"grouz\\" (’£’º’∏÷Ç’¶), which means curly or frizzled. This was because many people from his extended family had curly hair. His surname was changed twice; the first time by a schoolteacher, Melikian (first name unknown), who observed that there is no such surname as Grouzian, just Grouzinian. The second time was when he changed it to Vratsian. He also describes that after the incident with Melikian, his family was divided into three camps: the Grouzian camp, which included his mother, who thought he was a traitor, and his conservative uncle Garabed. The Grouzinian camp, which consists of his \\"lover of all new things\\" (as described by Vratsian) uncle Mergian, and finally the Vratsian camp, in which Simon was the only member (he also says that his grandmother died at age 116, but that it cannot be proven since most countries didn't start recording dates of birth until the year 1900). He describes his father as a storyteller, whose stories increased business for the family coffee shop. He also writes in his memoirs (‘ø’•’°’∂÷Ñ’´ ’à÷Ç’≤’´’∂’•÷Ä’∏’æ, Along Life's Paths) about his rich maternal uncle Mikishka, and estimates that his net worth in several millions of dollars. Vratsian recounts how his 'cheap' and 'stingy 'maternal uncle Mikishka gave him the equivalent of 20 modern US cents for a 2,000 kilometer journey. He also recalls how later, when he was getting involved in Armenian political parties, he was going to be a member of the Social-Democrat Hnchakian Party. However, he and his friend accidentally walked into a Dashnak meeting, themselves becoming Dashnaks. He also describes Dashnak General Congresses in detail, such as which member of the congress wanted an alliance with Russia, who wanted to fund the curing of Armenian villagers from lice, which hotel he stayed in, and who he became friends with. He describes friendships with Rostom, Hamazasp, Andranik, Armen Garo, Aram Manukian, and others. He even describes how those friendships began. For example, in the second volume of his memoir \\"‘ø’•’°’∂÷Ñ’´ ’à÷Ç’≤’´’∂’•÷Ä’∏’æ\\", he tells how he was a teacher of Armenian History for a year. One of his students who always disrupted class was Andranik's daughter. Vratsian hit Andranik's daughter, and was summoned to the Headmaster's office. There he met Andranik, and when Vratsian explained why he had hit his daughter, Andranik thanked Vratsian for disciplining her. In Vratsian's memoirs, there are no accounts of his wife or any children. Oliver Baldwin's \\"Six Prisons and Two Revolutions\\" gives us the only piece of evidence about his direct family. Baldwin was an Englishman who became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Armenian Army. He was at the house of Dr. Clarence Ussher (from the Near East Relief) when a messenger from Vratsian arrived asking Dr. Ussher to keep his wife and son safe when the Bolsheviks took over. However, while they were fleeing to Persia, Vratsian's son \\"died of exposure\\". There is no other mention of Vratsian's wife and son. He died in Beirut, Lebanon at age 86 or 87, on 21 May 1969.

His music is admired for its harmonic inventiveness and counterpoint. Zelenka was raised in Central Bohemia, educated in Prague and Vienna, and spent his professional life in Dresden. The greatest success during his career was the performance of the extensive composition Sub olea pacis et palma virtutis in the presence of the Emperor Charles VI, shortly after his coronation as king of Bohemia in 1723.  Life  Zelenka's memorial plaque in Lou≈àovice pod Blan√≠kem, Czech Republic, is the work of Marie Uchytilov√° and was installed in 1984. Zelenka's place of birth, at Lou≈àovice pod Blan√≠kem, now Czech Republic, marked by a memorial with the plaque and sundial Zelenka was born in Lou≈àovice pod Blan√≠kem (German: Launiowitz), a small market town southeast of Prague, in Bohemia. He was the eldest of eight children born to Marie Magdalena (by maiden name H√°jek) and Ji≈ô√≠ Zelenka. The middle name Dismas is probably his confirmation name. Zelenka's father Ji≈ô√≠ was a schoolmaster and organist in Lou≈àovice, and was likely his first music teacher. Nothing more is known with certainty about Zelenka's early years, but it is known that he received his musical training at the Jesuit college Clementinum in Prague and that his instrument was the violone (bass viol). His first works were probably written in Prague. His earliest known work is the school drama Via laureta (ZWV 245), composed in 1704, from which only the libretto has been preserved and the music is lost. In 1709 in Prague, Zelenka served Baron von Johann Hubert von Hartig before his appointment as a violone player in Dresden's royal orchestra.Kapsa, V√°clav, Perutkov√°, Jana and Sp√°ƒçilov√°, Jana, Some remarks on the relationship of Bohemian aristocracy to Italian music at the time of Pergolesi, in: Giovanni Battista Pergolesi e la musica napoletana in Europa centrale (Studi pergolesiani ‚Äì Pergolesi studies 8), ed. C. Bacciagaluppi, H.-G. Ottenberg and L. Zoppelli, Bern, Peter Lang, 2012, pp. 315-316. Baron von Hartig was a well-known connoisseur of music and a virtuoso musician. He corresponded with many important Italian composers, and amassed a great music library which Zelenka would later have access to, notably including Antonio Lotti's Missa Sapientiae. Zelenka copied this work from Hartig's collection around 1729, and later in the 1730s Johann Sebastian Bach acquired a copy of it from Zelenka's library. George Frideric Handel's copy of the same Mass might also have been acquired through Zelenka. When Johann Hubert died in Prague in 1741, Zelenka dedicated his Litaniae Lauretanae 'Salus infirmorum' (ZWV 152) to his old patron. Baron von Hartig may have recommended Zelenka to the Dresden Hofkapelle (court orchestra) as a double bass player. In any event, he entered the service of the Dresden court with a salary of 300 thalers in 1710/11. The favorable conditions for music making there added impetus to his creativity, particularly with respect to the composition of sacred music for the Catholic court church. His first major work in Dresden was a Mass, the \\"Missa Sanctae Caeciliae\\" (c. 1711). Zelenka's music must have impressed the court, because only a few months after his arrival in Dresden his salary was increased to 350 thalers. This placed him among the most highly paid musicians in the Hofkapelle. Three years later, it was raised to 400 thalers. In 1716, Zelenka continued his education in Vienna under the Habsburg Imperial Kapellmeister Johann Joseph Fux. It is unlikely that he visited Venice as once thought. A Saxon court document of 1715 records a royal cash advance for a trip to Italy Zelenka with his fellow musicians and composers Pierre (Peter) Gabriel Buffardin, Johann Christian Richter and Johann Georg Pisendel. New documents confirming the arrival of the oboist Richter and violinist Pisendel in Italy have now surfaced but neither Zelenka nor Buffardin were travelling with them.Stockigt, Janice B. and √Åg√∫stsson, J√≥hannes (2015), Reflections and Recent Findings on the Life and Music of Jan Dismas Zelenka (1679‚Äì1745), Clavibus unitis 4: 7‚Äì48 (p. 12). Available online. Back in Dresden in 1719, he remained there except for an extended stay in Prague in 1722-3, when he conducted the premi√®re of one of his major secular works, Sub olea pacis et palma virtutis conspicua orbi regia Bohemiae Corona (a melodrama about St. Wenceslas), at the time of the coronation of Charles VI. While in Prague he composed some of his highly original instrumental works, as seen in the autograph of the score of Concerto √† 8 Concertanti ‚Äî \\"Six concerti written in a hurry in Prague in 1723\\" (ZWV 186, 187, 188, 189). View from the right bank of the Elbe on the mid-18th century baroque city of Dresden, the seat of the Elector and ruler of Saxony. In the early 1720s, Zelenka composed some of his finest works like the Responsoria pro hebdomada (ZWV 55) and the Lamentations (ZWV 53). His compositions still constitute an important part of the repertory of the Catholic court church. Following the frequent illnesses of Kapellmeister Johann David Heinichen, Zelenka gradually took over the direction of the sacred music. In January 1726, he began entering his own works and those of others he collected into a register called Inventarium (1726-39), one of the most important documents of Dresden baroque music. In July 1729, Heinichen died and Zelenka became acting Kapellmeister, a position he occupied in an unofficial capacity until 1734. This period is known as the Interregnum, a term coined by Professor Wolfgang Horn.Horn, Wolfgang, Die Dresdner Hofkirchenmusik 1720-1745: Studien zu ihren Voraussetzungen und ihrem Repertoire, Kassel, B√§renreiter ‚Äì Stuttgart, Carus, 1987, p. 89. The first work that confirms Zelenka's new status is a Sinfonia (ZWV 190, 18 May 1729, previously known as Capriccio), which, as Janice B.

Available online The official publication K√∂nigl. Polnischer und Churf√ºrstl. S√§chsischer Hoff- und Staats-Calender (Hof- from 1734), which listed the members and servants of the Dresden court, listed Zelenka as a Contra-Basso & Compositeur in the editions of 1731 and 1732; in 1733, he is listed as a Compositeur only, which suggests that he was no longer playing the double bass. Instead, he most likely directed the music in his capacity as a singer. The period of the Interregnum gave birth to a number of outlandish theories on Zelenka's position at the Dresden court, and especially around his petitions from October/November 1733 for the Kapellmeister position. The fact is that before the death of Heinichen in 1729, the Dresden court was already actively looking for a well-established opera composer to take Heinichen's place. This was a part of a long-term project to re-establish the Italian opera in Dresden. In 1724, the Dresden court began training five young Italian opera singers with some of the finest vocal teachers in Italy like Nicola Porpora, a great composer in his own right and future teacher of the young Joseph Haydn. In the first week of February 1730, the young singers, the castrato alto Domenico Annibali, the castrato sopranos Giovanni Bindi (also called Porporino), Ventura Rocchetti 'Venturini' and the sister sopranos Maria Rosa Negri and Anna Negri were called to Dresden. There is hardly any coincidence that in the same week, Johann Adolf Hasse was offered the \\"primo\\" Kapellmeister position.√Åg√∫stsson, J√≥hannes (2013), The Secular Vocal Collection of Jan Dismas Zelenka ‚Äì A Reconstruction, Studi vivaldiani 13: 3-52 (p. 31). Following the arrival of the five young singers in Dresden in April 1730, Zelenka played an important role in their continuing education. After the \\"compositeur de la musique italienne\\" Giovanni Alberto Ristori travelled to Moscow in the end of 1730, Zelenka, as the senior composer at the court, became responsible for supplying secular vocal music for the chamber concerts at the royal palace in Dresden. It is at this point in time when he began to assemble his fascinating collection of Italian opera and cantata scores, which partly still exists in Dresden and are individually numbered in Zelenka's own hand. This suggest that he wrote down a complete inventory of the secular works in his possession, and by referring to the numbers he assigned each work it was possible to reconstruct the now missing inventory. This included a number of arias of Hasse, who arrived in Dresden in July 1731 with his famous wife, Faustina Bordoni-Hasse, the most brilliant female singer of the Baroque era. Shortly after his arrival, Hasse was officially appointed Kapellmeister and, unrivalled and unchallenged, retained the position for the next 32 years. After the performances of his opera Cleofide in September 1731, Hasse and Faustina travelled back to Italy, but not before the future arrangements of the Hofkapelle had been decided and later put in motion. Pisendel, one of the greatest violinist of the baroque era, was officially appointed Konzertmeister. Eleven new musicians were hired for the orchestra on 28 November of the same year. On that same day, Zelenka was awarded a handsome salary increase of 37.5%, which brought his wages up to 550 thalers. This might have enabled him to purchase 24 opera arias, one duet, eight secular cantatas and two sacred motets in score from Antonio Vivaldi, music he was then able to use both in the chamber and the church.Ibid, pp. 38-40. After August II died in Warsaw on 1 February 1733, his son and successor as Saxon Elector Friedrich August moved swiftly and signed Hasse and Faustina to an extraordinary contract worth an astonishing 6,000 thalers annually, while their travel expenses were also paid for by the court. At that time, Hasse was already one of the most famous composers in Europe and it was a major coup for the Dresden court to have secured his and Faustina's services. Confirmation of Hasse's position is seen in the libretto to his Siroe which was performed in Bologna in May 1733, where the composer was awarded the title of Maestro di Cappella di S.A. R. l‚ÄôElettore di Sassonia. In that same month, Zelenka was also referred to as the elector's \\"well-born and virtuoso Kapellmeister\\" in a letter written by the Superior of the Catholic court church in Dresden. Following the election of Friedrich August as August III, King of Poland in October 1733, servants from all departments of the Dresden court sent in petitions for unpaid salaries or promotions. Zelenka was one of those who petitioned. It was only natural for the composer to wish to attain official recognition from the newly elected Polish king. The impression has often been given in the literature that Zelenka was in direct competition with Hasse for the Kapellmeister position, but this is a misunderstanding. It was very clear to Zelenka at that time that his colleague Hasse was, and would remain, senior Kapellmeister.Stockigt, Janice B. and √Åg√∫stsson, J√≥hannes (2016), The Visit of Members of the Dresden Hofkapelle to Bautzen: May 1733, Clavibus unitis 5: 1-12. This led the Dresden court to create the official position of church composer (essentially Vice-Kapellmeister), which Zelenka held from 1734 onwards, along with his student Tobias Buz and, from November 1736 onwards, J.S. Bach, who received a \\"titular\\" position. Bach held Zelenka in high esteem, and the two composers knew each other, as evidenced by a letter of 13 January 1775 from his son C.P.E. Bach to the Bach biographer Johann Nikolaus Forkel. Bach was trusted enough by Zelenka for his eldest son Wilhelm Friedemann to copy out the Amen from Zelenka's third Magnificat (ZWV 108) to use in the Leipzig's St. Thomas' Church, where J. S. Bach was cantor for the last two and a half decades of his life. In addition to composing, Zelenka taught throughout his life a number of prominent musicians of his time, like Johann Joachim Quantz (Frederick the Great of Prussia's longtime court flautist and flute teacher) and J. G. Roellig. His close friends included eminent composers such as Georg Philipp Telemann, Johann Georg Pisendel and Sylvius Leopold Weiss. Plaque in the Kleine Br√ºdergasse in Dresden commemorating Zelenka's last place of residence. On 23 December 1745, Zelenka died of dropsy and was buried on Christmas Eve. He never married and had no children, and his compositions and musical estate were purchased from his beneficiaries by the Electress of Saxony and the Queen of Poland Maria Josepha of Austria. After his death, these were considered valuable court possessions. Telemann, with Pisendel's assistance, tried unsuccessfully to publish Zelenka's \\"Responsoria.\\" On 17 April 1756, he wrote that \\"the complete manuscript will be at the Dresden court, kept under lock and key as something very rare.\\" There is no confirmed portrait of Zelenka, but worthy of mention is a black-and-white mirror-image copy of a well-known portrait of his old teacher Fux which has been passed off as a picture of Zelenka on several respected websites.  Musical style  Zelenka's pieces are characterized by a very daring compositional structure with a highly spirited harmonic invention and complex counterpoint. His works are often virtuosic and difficult to perform, but always fresh and surprising, with sudden turns of harmony. In particular, his writing for bass instruments is far more demanding than that of other composers of his era. His instrumental works, the trio sonatas, capricci, and concertos are exemplary models of his early style (1710s ‚Äì1720s). The six trio sonatas demand high virtuosity and expressive sensitivity from performers. As Zelenka was himself a violone player, he was known to write fast-moving continuo parts with driving and complicated rhythm. Zelenka was aware of the music in different regions of Europe. He wrote complex fugues, ornate operatic arias, galant-style dances, baroque recitatives, Palestrina-like chorales, and virtuosic concertos. Zelenka's musical language is closest to Bach's, especially in its richness of contrapuntal harmonies and ingenious usage of fugal themes. Nevertheless, Zelenka's language is idiosyncratic in its unexpected harmonic twists, obsession with chromatic harmonies, large usage of syncopated and tuplet figures, and unusually long phrases full of varied musical ideas. He is sometimes considered Bach's Catholic counterpart. Zelenka's music is influenced by Czech folk music. In this respect, he continues the tradition of the production of specific Czech national music initiated by Adam Michna z Otradovic and brought to its culmination by Bed≈ôich Smetana and Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k in the nineteenth century and Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek and Bohuslav Martin≈Ø in the twentieth century. Rediscovery Zelenka memorial site at the Old Catholic Cemetery in Dresden The rediscovery of Jan Dismas Zelenka's work is attributed to Bed≈ôich Smetana, who rewrote some scores from the archives in Dresden and introduced one of the composer's orchestral suites in Prague's New Town Theatre festivals in 1863. It was mistakenly assumed that many of Zelenka's autograph scores were destroyed during the firebombing of Dresden in February 1945. However, the scores were not kept in the Katholische Hofkirche but in the basement of the Japanese Palace, north of the river Elbe. Some are certainly missing, but this probably happened gradually ‚Äì and the lost scores represent only a small proportion of his extant works. Interest in Zelenka's music has begun to grow, especially since the end of the 1950s. By the late 1960s and early 1970s all Zelenka's instrumental compositions and selected liturgical music were published in Czechoslovakia. The most important revival was demonstrated by the first presentation of selected compositions by the Czech conductor Milan Munclinger and his ensemble Ars Rediviva. They were three trio sonatas in 1958‚Äì60, Sinfonia concertante in 1963 and the exquisite interpretation of \\"Lamentationes Jeremiae prophetae\\" with the soloists Karl Berman, Nedda Casei and Theo Altmeyer in 1969. The music of Zelenka has become widely known and available since that time through recordings and sparked the interest of other musicians such as Heinz Holliger and Reinhard Goebel. More than half of Zelenka's works have now been recorded, mostly in the Czech Republic and Germany. Such recordings include the masses Missa Purificationis, Missa Sanctissimae trinitatis, Missa Votiva, Missa Sancti Josephi, and his secular works \\"Sub olea pacis\\" and \\"Il Diamante\\", mostly performed by new Czech ensembles using original instruments and interpretational techniques of the Baroque era. The most popular are Musica Florea, Collegium 1704, Ensemble In√©gal, and Capella Regia Musicalis. In honor of Jan Dismas Zelenka, in 1984 \\"The Autumn Music Festival under Blan√≠k\\" (Podblanick√Ω hudebn√≠ podzim in Czech) was founded and commemorated with the memorial plaque on his house. Since then, performances of Zelenka's music have regularly taken place in and around his birthplace.  Works  Zelenka's complete compositions are listed in the digitized database of the Petrucci Music Library, as well as on the Discover Zelenka website.Discover Zelenka (Find/browse works), https://www.jdzelenka.net/, based on the catalogs of Wolfgang Horn, Thomas Kohlhase, Janice B. Stockigt et al. The total number of Zelenka's known and attributed opus-numbered works is 249. The sacred vocal-instrumental music is at the center of his compositions and include over 20 masses, four extensive oratorios and requiems, two Magnificats and Te Deum settings, 13 litanies, many psalms, hymns, and antiphons. Zelenka also wrote a number of purely instrumental works ‚Äì six trio or quartet sonatas, five capricci, one \\"Hipocondrie\\" and other concertos, overtures and symphonies. = Sacred music = The most appreciated of Zelenka's sacred works are probably his masses, above all his Missa Purificationis (ZWV 16, his last mass to include brass instruments) and his final five pieces (ZWV 17‚Äì21), commonly called \\"High Mass\\" compositions, written between 1736 and 1741 and considered as Zelenka's compositional peak. The last three were also called \\"Missae ultimae\\" (Last Masses). The list below contains only the most important sacred works, that have been sufficiently explored to date.

It is a monumental opus with aspects of melodrama, oratory and contemporary opera, composed for the coronation of Charles VI by the Czech king and celebrating the memory of the greatest Czech saint and patron of Bohemia, prince St. Wenceslaus (V√°clav), one of the founders of the Czech state.

To date, he has released six studio albums, two EPs, and thirteen singles. His debut album, Here Be Monsters, was nominated for the 2001 Mercury Prize. Since 2007 he has been writing for other artists, including Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Paloma Faith, and has performed with Marianne Faithfull and the Libertines. His music is influenced by Tom Waits, Nick Cave, and Jeff Buckley, among others. Career Harcourt was born Edward Henry Richard Harcourt-Smith on 14 August 1977, in Wimbledon, London, England.[1] The youngest of three, Harcourt is the son of Maj. Charles Harcourt-Smith of the Life Guards and also a former diplomat, and his wife Sabrina, an art historian. Ed began to study piano at the age of nine and achieved grade 8 when he was 17. He declined the offer to study music, citing \\"the idea of having to analyse, dissect and everything [of one piece of music] would completely destroy any enjoyment\\". Before going solo, Harcourt played the bass and keyboards for Snug, a band formed at school in the mid-1990s by Harcourt, James Deane, Ed Groves and Johnny Lewsley. The band recorded two albums and a handful of singles together before dissolving. In 2000, Harcourt recorded his debut mini-album Maplewood EP straight to a 4-track recorder at Wootton Manor. After signing with Heavenly Records and releasing Maplewood in November 2000, Harcourt recorded his debut studio album Here Be Monsters with producers Gil Norton and Tim Holmes. The album was released in June 2001, and charted on the UK Albums Chart at No. 84. One month after its release, the album was nominated for the 2001 Mercury Prize. He later described the period as \\"very strange for me, I was naive, I knew nothing. I was used to making music in my room, so it felt very odd being on stage\\". In the US he signed with Capitol Records. Following the non-album single release of the Brian Wilson cover \\"Still I Dream of It\\" in October 2002, Harcourt recorded and released his second album From Every Sphere in February 2003. The album became his highest-charting release in the UK, peaking at No. 39. The album also performed moderately well across Europe, peaking at No. 6 in Sweden, No. 25 in Norway, and No. 103 in France. From Every Sphere also yielded his highest- charting single to date, \\"All of Your Days Will Be Blessed\\", at No. 35. A second single, \\"Watching the Sun Come Up\\", was less successful, peaking at No. 79. After a steady schedule of tour dates in the UK, Harcourt's third album, Strangers, was released in September 2004. The album peaked at No. 57 in the UK and at No. 7 in Sweden, and produced the singles \\"This One's for You\\", \\"Born in the '70s\\", and \\"Loneliness.\\" Through 2005 Harcourt played some live dates with a side-project he called Wild Boar. In August 2005, the B-sides and rarities compilation Elephant's Graveyard was released as a digital download. In the same year he performed at the annual Meltdown Festival in London, supporting the Brian Jonestown Massacre and joining the curator Patti Smith for a rendition of \\"Pissing in a River\\". He was also part of the ensemble that performed the William Blake inspired Songs of Innocence. Harcourt's fourth album The Beautiful Lie was released in June 2006 to generally favourable reviews, with Allmusic describing the album as \\"an invigorating and frequently gorgeous affair, essential for old fans and a good place to start for newcomers.\\" The album was not as successful on the UK charts, peaking at No. 97. The Beautiful Lie was co-produced with Jari Haapalainen, and features contributions from The Magic Numbers, who sing backing vocals on \\"Revolution in the Heart\\"; Graham Coxon, who plays guitar on first single \\"Visit from the Dead Dog\\"; and Ed's wife Gita, who plays violin throughout and sings duet vocals on the track \\"Braille\\". He later described the release as \\"the b√™te noire of the albums\\". Harcourt recorded several tracks with the French jazz trumpeter Erik Truffaz for the album Arkhangelsk, released in early 2007. He also performed live with Truffaz's group to promote the album, and they filmed a Take-Away Show video session shot by Vincent Moon. In October 2007, Harcourt released the compilation album Until Tomorrow Then: The Best of Ed Harcourt, collecting material from the first seven years of his recording career. With the release he completed his obligations with Heavenly/EMI and the contract was not renewed. As a consequence he stepped away from his solo career as he was \\"really bored and sick of myself and my music. I had tried for seven years to make it and break into the mainstream and it didn't happen\\". In 2009, Harcourt signed with Dovecote Records in the United States to release The Beautiful Lie stateside, as well as his new EP Russian Roulette which appeared in May of that year. Also in 2009, Harcourt composed the original music for the soundtrack to the Donnie Darko sequel S. Darko. In early 2010, he wrote a song called \\"Isabel\\" for the SOS Children's Villages Emergency Relief Fund in Haiti.Supernanas.org ‚Äì Haiti Relief Harcourt's fifth studio album Lustre was released on 14 June 2010, the first on his record label Piano Wolf Recordings. The album was produced by Ryan Hadlock at Bear Creek Studios. In February 2013, Harcourt released the album Back into The Woods through CCCLX, the new label set-up by his manager Sean Adams. It was recorded during a one-day session helmed by Pete Hutchings at the Abbey Road Studios and featured his wife Gita on violin and Arnulf Lindner (cello). The release was supported by a headlining tour around England. In January 2014, Harcourt released Time of Dust, a six-track mini-album on CCCLX. It includes the duet \\"Come Into My Dreamland\\" with Kathryn Williams. In 2015 he performed the 17-minute piece \\"Restoration\\" for the Belgian charity MusicFund. It was inspired by the BBC documentary Our World: Saving Gaza's grand piano broadcast that featured the work of the charity. In August 2016, Harcourt released his seventh solo album Furnaces, produced by Flood. It was described as \\"gently apocalyptic pop with billowy choruses\\". =Live= Ed Harcourt with Wild Boar at The Barfly Club, Camden, August 2005.

Harcourt opened for The Gutter Twins on their European tour in 2008, as well as joining the group on stage to play guitar on some songs, most notably on their appearance on Later... with Jools Holland, performing the single \\"Idle Hands.\\". In December 2013 Harcourt made a guest appearance with Laura Jansen at Bush Hall, London to sing \\"A Call to Arms\\". On 26 June 2015, The Libertines were the surprise special guests on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury Festival 2015, with Harcourt joining them on stage to play piano. He also joined the band on stage during the Reading and Leeds Festivals Headline slots in August 2015. On 22 October 2017, Harcourt played (as band leader) the whole Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album live at the Philharmonie de Paris for Arte TV show with a little help from Carl Bar√¢t and Pete Doherty (The Libertines), Barrie Cadogan (Primal Scream), Danny Goffey and Gaz Coombes (Supergrass), Steve Mason and others.  Songwriting  After the release of the Best Of collection Until Tomorrow Then in 2007, Harcourt changed career and became a songwriter for other acts. In 2008, he co-wrote the title track for the Paloma Faith album Do You Want The Truth Or Something Beautiful?, which reached #64 in the UK singles chart. In 2013 Harcourt worked with Sophie Ellis-Bextor on her fifth studio album Wanderlust, which Harcourt co-wrote and produced. He has written for and performed with Marianne Faithful on her Give My Love to London project in 2014. Other artists include Jamie Cullum, James Bay and Lisa Marie Presley. In 2015, Harcourt provided vocals for the track \\"Villain\\" from the album 8:58, a project by Paul Hartnoll.  Personal life  He is married to the singer and musician Gita Harcourt-Smith, n√©e Langley, singer and songwriter in The Langley Sisters.

These include detailed underlying measures that rely on double-entry accounting. By design, such accounting makes the totals on both sides of an account equal even though they each measure different characteristics, for example production and the income from it. As a method, the subject is termed national accounting or, more generally, social accounting.Nancy D. Ruggles, 1987. \\"social accounting,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4, pp. 377‚Äì82. Stated otherwise, national accounts as systems may be distinguished from the economic data associated with those systems.United Nations, The System of National Accounts and √∂National Accounts Data. While sharing many common principles with business accounting, national accounts are based on economic concepts.Joel S. Demski, 2008. \\"accounting and economics,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Abstract. One conceptual construct for representing flows of all economic transactions that take place in an economy is a social accounting matrix with accounts in each respective row-column entry.Graham Pyatt and Jeffery I. Round, ed., 1985. Social Accounting Matrices: A Basis for Planning, World Bank. National accounting has developed in tandem with macroeconomics from the 1930s with its relation of aggregate demand to total output through interaction of such broad expenditure categories as consumption and investment.John Maynard Keynes, 1936. The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Macmillan. Economic data from national accounts are also used for empirical analysis of economic growth and development. Scope National accounts broadly present output, expenditure, and income activities of the economic actors (households, corporations, government) in an economy, including their relations with other countries' economies, and their wealth (net worth). They present both flows (measured but it is over a period) and stocks (measured at the end of a period), ensuring that the flows are reconciled with the stocks. As to flows, the national income and product accounts (in U.S. terminology) provide estimates for the money value of income and output per year or quarter, including GDP. As to stocks, the 'capital accounts' are a balance-sheet approach that has assets on one side (including values of land, the capital stock, and financial assets) and liabilities and net worth on the other, measured as of the end of the accounting period. National accounts also include measures of the changes in assets, liabilities, and net worth per accounting period. These may refer to flow of funds accounts or, again, capital accounts. There are a number of aggregate measures in the national accounts, notably including gross domestic product or GDP, perhaps the most widely cited measure of aggregate economic activity. Ways of breaking down GDP include as types of income (wages, profits, etc.) or expenditure (consumption, investment/saving, etc.). Measures of these are examples of macro-economic data.Referred to in the Journal of Economic Literature classification codes under JEL: C8 - Data Collection and Data Estimation Methodology and JEL: E01 - Measurement and Data on National Income and Product Accounts and Wealth. Such aggregate measures and their change over time are generally of strongest interest to economic policymakers, although the detailed national accounts contain a source of information for economic analysis, for example in the input-output tables which show how industries interact with each other in the production process. National accounts can be presented in nominal or real amounts, with real amounts adjusted to remove the effects of price changes over time.‚Ä¢ Amartya Sen, 1979. \\"The Welfare Basis of Real Income Comparisons: A Survey,\\" Journal of Economic Literature, 17(1), p p. 1‚Äì45. ‚Ä¢ D. Usher, 1987. \\"real income,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4, p. 104. A corresponding price index can also be derived from national output. Rates of change of the price level and output may also be of interest. An inflation rate (growth rate of the price level) may be calculated for national output or its expenditure components. Economic growth rates (most commonly the growth rate of GDP) are generally measured in real (constant- price) terms. One use of economic-growth data from the national accounts is in growth accounting across longer periods of time for a country or across to estimate different sources of growth, whether from growth of factor inputs or technological change.From The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2008, 2nd Edition, with Abstract links: ‚Ä¢ \\"economic growth\\" by Peter Howitt and David N. Weil ‚Ä¢ \\"growth accounting\\" by Francesco Caselli. The accounts are derived from a wide variety of statistical source data including surveys, administrative and census data, and regulatory data, which are integrated and harmonized in the conceptual framework. They are usually compiled by national statistical offices and/or central banks in each country, though this is not always the case, and may be released on both an annual and (less detailed) quarterly frequency. Practical issues include inaccuracies from differences between economic and accounting methodologies, lack of controlled experiments on quality of data from diverse sources, and measurement of intangibles and services of the banking and financial sectors.‚Ä¢ Oskar Morgenstern, 1963.

Two developments relevant to the national accounts since the 1980s include the following. Generational accounting is a method for measuring redistribution of lifetime tax burdens across generations from social insurance, including social security and social health insurance. It has been proposed as a better guide to the sustainability of a fiscal policy than budget deficits, which reflect only taxes minus spending in the current year.‚Ä¢ The Economist, Economics A-Z, \\"Generational Accounting.\\" Accessed 9 Aug. 2010. ‚Ä¢ Jagadeesh Gokhale, 2008. \\"generational accounting.\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition.

Environmental or green national accounting is the method of valuing environmental assets, which are usually not counted in measuring national wealth, in part due to the difficulty of valuing them. The method has been proposed as an alternative to an implied zero valuation of environmental assets and as a way of measuring the sustainability of welfare levels in the presence of environmental degradation.From The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2008, 2nd Edition, with Abstract links: ‚Ä¢ \\"green national accounting\\" by Sjak Smulders ‚Ä¢ \\"sustainability' by Daniel W.

Macroeconomic data not derived from the national accounts are also of wide interest, for example some cost-of-living indexes, the unemployment rate, and the labor force participation rate.‚Ä¢ Robert Topel, 2008. \\"unemployment,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition. Abstract. ‚Ä¢ Katharine Bradbury, 2008. \\"unemployment measurement,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition. Abstract. In some cases, a national- accounts counterpart of these may be estimated, such as a price index computed from the personal consumption expenditures and the GDP gap (the difference between observed GDP and potential GDP).Robert J. Gordon and Peter K. Clark, 1984, \\"Unemployment and Potential Output in the 1980s,\\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, (2), pp. 537-568 . Main components The presentation of national accounts data may vary by country (commonly, aggregate measures are given greatest prominence), however the main national accounts include the following accounts for the economy as a whole and its main economic actors. *Current accounts: ::production accounts which record the value of domestic output and the goods and services used up in producing that output. The balancing item of the accounts is value added, which is equal to GDP when expressed for the whole economy at market prices and in gross terms; ::income accounts, which show primary and secondary income flows - both the income generated in production (e.g. wages and salaries) and distributive income flows (predominantly the redistributive effects of government taxes and social benefit payments). The balancing item of the accounts is disposable income (\\"National Income\\" when measured for the whole economy); ::expenditure accounts, which show how disposable income is either consumed or saved. The balancing item of these accounts is saving. *Capital accounts, which record the net accumulation, as the result of transactions, of non-financial assets; and the financing, by way of saving and capital transfers, of the accumulation. Net lending/borrowing is the balancing item for these accounts *Financial accounts, which show the net acquisition of financial assets and the net incurrence of liabilities. The balance on these accounts is the net change in financial position. *Balance sheets, which record the stock of assets, both financial and non-financial, and liabilities at a particular point in time. Net worth is the balance from the balance sheets (United Nations, 1993). The accounts may be measured as gross or net of consumption of fixed capital (a concept in national accounts similar to depreciation in business accounts). Notably absent from these components, however, is unpaid work, because its value is not included in any of the aforementioned categories of accounts, just as it is not included in calculating gross domestic product (GDP). An Australian study has shown the value of this uncounted work to be approximately 50% of GDP, making its exclusion rather significant. As GDP is tied closely to the national accounts system, this may lead to a distorted view of national accounts. Because national accounts are widely used by governmental policy-makers in implementing controllable economic agendas, some analysts have advocated for either a change in the makeup of national accounts or adjustments in the formulation of public policy. History The original motivation for the development of national accounts and the systematic measurement of employment was the need for accurate measures of aggregate economic activity. This was made more pressing by the Great Depression and as a basis for Keynesian macroeconomic stabilisation policy and wartime economic planning. The first efforts to develop such measures were undertaken in the late 1920s and 1930s, notably by Colin Clark and Simon Kuznets. Richard Stone of the U.K. led later contributions during World War II and thereafter. The first formal national accounts were published by the United States in 1947. Many European countries followed shortly thereafter, and the United Nations published A System of National Accounts and Supporting Tables in 1952.Andr√© Vanoli, 2008. \\"national accounting, history of,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition. Abstract. International standards for national accounting are defined by the United Nations System of National Accounts, with the most recent version released for 2008.United Nations, System of National Accounts 2008-2008 SNA. Even before that in early 1920s there were national economic accounts tables. One of such systems was called Balance of national economy and was used in USSR and other socialistic countries to measure the efficiency of socialistic production.Economic theory , . In Europe, the worldwide System of National Accounts has been adapted in the European System of Accounts (ESA), which is applied by members of the European Union and many other European countries.

Goods may travel between the two entities without any customs restrictions. The Customs Union does not cover essential economic areas such as agriculture (to which bilateral trade concessions apply), services or public procurement. In 1996 a free trade area was established between Turkey and the European Union for products covered by the European Coal and Steel Community. Decision 1/98 of the Association Council covers trade in agricultural products. In addition to providing for a common external tariff for the products covered, the Customs Union foresees that Turkey is to align to the acquis communautaire in several essential internal market areas, notably with regard to industrial standards. According to a 2020 study, the agreement boosted trade between the EU and Turkey. In manufacturing, there was a 55‚Äì65 per cent increase in EU‚ÄêTurkey trade compared with the Ankara Agreement.  Results for Turkey  The customs union increased both imports and exports in Turkey,https://ecomod.net/sites/default/files/document- conference/ecomod2003/Neyapti.pdf as well as its GDP per capita. Turkey's membership of the customs union is recognised as having played a significant part in its economy's transition from agrarian to industrial. As Turkey is in a customs union with the EU, it has to adjust its tariffs and duties to match those of the EU. However, the free trade agreements (FTAs) signed by the EU do not extend to Turkey, so the EU's FTA partners can export to Turkey tariff- free, while maintaining tariffs on Turkish goods, unless they also conclude a separate FTA agreement with Turkey. During the negotiation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), Turkey raised the prospect of leaving the customs union over the economic contraction it would suffer as American goods would enter Turkey tariff-free and Turkish goods would continue to face American tariffs. The EU and Turkey are in negotiations for amending the customs union agreement to add Turkey to the EU's present and future FTAs.  EU member state candidacy  Turkey has been an associate member of the European Community (EC) since 1964, following the signing in 1963 of the Ankara Agreement (EEC-Turkey Association Agreement (1963)) with the EEC. Turkey applied for full membership on 14 April 1987. The decision to consider Turkey's application was deferred until 1993, because the European Community was in the process of becoming the even (politically and economically) tighter European Union. The fall of the Soviet Union and German reunification delayed the decision on Turkish membership even more. During those years the European Community had also become reluctant to consider Turkey's application. At the Helsinki summit in December 1999 Turkey was given the status of a candidate country. At the end of 2004, the European Commission has issued a report with positive recommendations to the European Council, indicating the degree of compliance by Turkey of the Copenhagen political criteria. On this basis, the European Council decided to start accession negotiations with Turkey on 3 October 2005. Since then, no significant progress has been made towards membership nor is there evidence of political will to do so. Update proposals In December 2016, the European Commission released an assessment proposing to update and modernize the agreement which includes services and public procurement. The report concludes with two options; Enhanced Commercial Framework (ECF) or Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA). As of 2020 March, the Council didn't adapt the proposal yet. Since 2015, Turkish government has made several meetings to assess updating the agreement.  Euro-Mediterranean free trade area  Finally, Turkey is also member of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and as such is interested in concluding free trade agreements with all other Mediterranean partners, with a view to the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area, originally aimed for by 2010.

This species grows on shorelines in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Range Locations it is known from include Florida, Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, Central and South America from Mexico to Brazil on the Atlantic Coast and Mexico to Ecuador on the Pacific Coast, western Africa and in Melanesia and Polynesia. It was introduced in Kuwait because it can thrive in high temperatures and absorbs brackish water. Description Conocarpus erectus is usually a dense multiple-trunked shrub, tall, but can grow into a tree up to or more tall, with a trunk up to in diameter. The United States National Champion green buttonwood is tall, has a spread of , and a circumference of . The bark is thick and has broad plates of thin scales which are gray to brown. The twigs are brittle, and angled or narrowly winged in cross-section. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple and oblong, long (rarely to long) and broad, with a tapering tip and an entire margin. They are dark green and shiny on top, and paler with fine silky hairs underneath, and have two salt glands at the base of each leaf.US Forest Service The fruits are button-like (from which the common names derive), diameter, with no petals; they are produced in stalked panicles of 35-56 flowers. The fruit is a cluster of red to brown, small scaly, two-winged cone-like seeds, long. The seed heads burst when ripe, and the seeds are dispersed by water. It is generally found growing in brackish water in tidal lagoons and bays, but can grow in inland habitats, with records at up to altitude in Costa Rica. Conocarpus erectus var. erectus Taxonomy These two varieties are not accepted as distinct by all authorities: *C. e. var. erectus - green buttonwood, leaves thinly hairy or hairless *C. e. var. sericeus - silver buttonwood, leaves densely silvery-hairy Uses The tree is used as an ornamental plant and in bonsai. The variety sericeus, with silvery leaves, is especially prized for landscaping. It is an important host plant for epiphytes. As a result of ornamental planting, it has become naturalized in Hawaii. It has been used extensively in landscaping in Kuwait and became the most abundant tree/shrub. Conocarpus is widely believed to be fodder for the African buffalo, and it is understood that this is the source of their acidic urine. The wood is sometimes used in cabinets; it is difficult to work but takes a smooth finish. It is also used as firewood, and is reported to be good for smoking meat and fish, as it burns very hot and slowly; it also makes high quality charcoal. The bark is high in tannin, for which it has been harvested commercially.

The story is a sequel and direct continuation of Mazinger Z series after its initial success.\\"Mazinger Z website\\". Retrieved 2014-07-03. The series was aired on Japanese television in 1974, immediately following the end of the first Mazinger series. It ran for 56 episodes. Mazinger Z: Infinity, a theatrical film sequel, taking place 10 years after the original series, was animated by Toei Animation and released in theaters on January 13, 2018.„ÄåÂäáÂ†¥Áâà„Éû„Ç∏„É≥„Ç¨„ÉºZ„Äç 2017Âπ¥10Êúà„Å´„Ç§„Çø„É™„Ç¢ÂÖ¨Èñã„ÄÅÊó•Êú¨„Çà„Çä3„ÉµÊúàÂÖàË°å - „Ç¢„Éã„É°„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥„Éì„Ç∏„Éç„Çπ„Éª„Ç∏„É£„Éº„Éä„É´ Plot The story centers on , an orphan raised by , who is the once thought dead father of Mazinger Z pilot Kouji Kabuto. Kenzo Kabuto is the creator of the new and improved version of Mazinger, which was based on his father's \\"Chogokin Z\\" (Super Alloy Z). The new version was designed with a stronger form to fight against humanity's new enemy, the Mycenae Empire, led by the Great General of Darkness and his army of Battle Beasts. Kabuto, then, gives the Great Mazinger to Tetsuya for him to use. Accompanying him is his female companion, Jun Hono, an orphaned half Japanese, half African-American girl, in her feminine robot, \\"Venus A (Venus Ace)\\". Tetsuya's training with Great Mazinger is completed just in time to come to Kabuto's aid as the Mycenae Battle Beasts overwhelm Mazinger Z. With the original Mazinger destroyed, Kabuto went to America to study space travel and left Japan's defense in the hands of Tetsuya and the Fortress of Science. Nevertheless, Tetsuya won against his fight with the Mycenae Battle Beasts, led by their military leader, Ankoku Daishogun (Great General of Darkness). After the Great General of Darkness' defeat, Doctor Hell of Mazinger Z went into disguise as the Great Marshall of Hell and leads the Mycenae forces. Production =Casting= Produced as a direct sequel to Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger also includes some cast members of the original series. This includes Shiro Kabuto (Kouji's little brother) and comic-relief robot Boss Borot. Discotek Media have licensed the series for a North American DVD release. Originally, Great Mazinger was to be included in Jim Terry's Force Five series. However, it was eventually swapped out with Spaceketeers, and was never aired in the United States. As was in Mazinger Z, nevertheless, it was successfully broadcast in Italy, Mexico, and other Latin American countries, unedited. =Appraisal and spin-offs= Although Great Mazinger did not achieve the same astronomical ratings as Mazinger Z, it was still highly popular to run a very successful 56 weeks. In fact, it even spawned a line of best-selling toys and merchandise as did its predecessor, as well as several spin-off theatrical featurettes. For example, it paved way for the creation of UFO Robo Grendizer. In addition, a footage from Great Mazinger's sole appearance in the final episode of Mazinger Z was aired as part of the US version of Mazinger Z, known as Tranzor Z. At that time, however, Great Mazinger had already been introduced to millions of American children under the name of Mazinga. As one of the imported products, the 24-inch Jumbo Machinder toys were released in the US by Mattel as part of their Shogun Warriors line in 1976. Great Mazinger was also the star of the short theatrical \\"team-up movie features\\" released in Japan such as Great Mazinger versus Grendizer, and Great Mazinger versus Getter Robo G among others. They were based on the anime crossovers of the manga creations of Go Nagai. For example, Tetsuya pilots an earlier version of Mazinger Z called Energer Z. Along with Jun, Tetsuya and the Great Mazinger are also featured in the Mazinkaiser OVA and Mazinkaiser: Death match! Ankoku Daishogun movie. The characters have been also a mainstay in Banpresto's Super Robot Wars, a popular battle-simulation/RPG series of video games based on many anime mecha shows. This includes the original Mazinger Z, Getter Robo, the Gundam series, and Neon Genesis Evangelion among others. Moreover, Tetsuya appears in Shin Mazinger Shougeki! Z Hen. Modern versions =2002: OVA version= In the 2002 OVA Mazinkaiser, Tetsuya fights alongside Kouji against Doctor Hell's forces. The OVA version of Great Mazinger is physically identical to the original, but with black coloring on the arms and legs instead of blue. Great is seriously damaged during the initial battle in the series. Near the end of the OVA, Tetsuya returns with a new and much more powerful Great, which is discovered in Doctor Juzo Kabuto's laboratory. =2003: Movie= Great also returns in the 2003 movie Mazinkaiser: Deathmatch! Ankoku Daishogun, where Tetsuya once more fights the Mycenae Empire using the prototype Great Mazinger for unknown reasons. Speculation is that both Mazinkaiser and Shin Great Mazinger were being upgraded in the Photon Labs, forcing Tetsuya to use the prototype Great Mazinger. This time, however, Great is incapacitated rather quickly, surviving battle but unable to continue fighting. Nevertheless, the battle did display Tetsuya's skill, as he was the only member of the Mazinger Army (made up of Great, Venus A and three mass-produced and significantly weaker versions of Mazinger Z) to defeat his attackers and survive. In the end, the newly upgraded Mazinkaiser was launched in space to rendezvous with the Kaiser Pilder. Mazinkaiser defeated Ankoku Daishogun and in the ending credits, we can see Mazinkaiser carrying the damaged Great Mazinger and Venus Ace. =2009: TV series= In the 2009 Shin Mazinger Shougeki! Z Hen series, Tetsuya is an ace pilot noted for incredibly easy mastering control over Mazinger Z prototype, Energer Z. He has assisted Kabuto Kenzo and Juzo, Dr. Hell and Tsubasa Nishikiori in exploring Bardos Island. When Dr. Hell makes his first attempts for world domination, Tetsuya sacrifices his life, allowing Tsubasa to shoot Kenzo, who has been possessed by alien Kedora, killing them both. He is later revealed to be Tsubasa's lost brother and his ghost is summoned by Viscount Pygman to haunt her. In the first episode, \\"Blade\\", a mysterious figure with a bearing striking resemblance to Tetsuya in his pilot costume and face unseen, kills Pygman. A silhouette of Great Mazinger is seen behind Blade but before the narrator can introduce it, Detective Ankokuji interrupts him saying it is yet \\"another story\\". Great General Of Darkness also appears in the first and last episodes of the series. The Battle Beasts of Mazinger The Battle Beasts (or sentoujuu/ Warrior Beasts), are the monsters and evil mecha from Great Mazinger. In the story, the Warrior Beasts are the secret super-weapons of the Mikene Empire, an ancient empire driven underground centuries in the past. = Characteristics and history = Like their predecessors Mechanical Monsters (kikaiju), Battle Beasts are armed with a variety of weapons such as ray beams, missiles, bombs, swords, spears, axes, nets, acids and drills. However, they are made of mechanical parts combined with organic parts, and were controlled by human brains. For example, a Mikene's Warrior is permanently placed and interfaced with the Battle Beast body that he can move like his own. In a way, the Battle Beasts are like giant cyborgs. As a result of this, most of them have a distinctive human head or face placed on the mechanical body, usually somewhere on the torso or on the head itself. They are far more powerful and thanks to their cyborg nature, they also have better reaction time, adaptability and skills than the Mechanical Beasts. Some of them are even capable of showing emotions or even speak. However, their cyborg nature is also a weakness: a direct hit on the human head or face can destroy or severely weaken the Warrior Beast. Throughout the series, there is a little information about them. In episode 2, the idea of imprisonment has been used on traitors; they have free will, but some might prove as psychotic. In episode 9, the idea of personal relationships is known: Minister Argos claims that the warrior beast Cleo is his daughter. Although most of them have murderous personalities, few do not such as the battle beast Bruton in episode 10 and Kelvinius in episode 16. In episode 16, Kelvinius has flashbacks indicating that the original Mycenae Empire was once a peaceful nation with him as the prince. However, the Emperor of Darkness came into the picture and ordered human sized Talos units to take over the entire nation and convert everyone into battle beasts. In episode 52, the process of \\"fusion\\" between the human and the robot is hinted: Shinichiro Okida was merged by Marquis Janus with a robot to create the Battle Beast Jerunicas. ;The seven armies The Battle Beasts could be grouped into one of 7 categories, as the entire Mikene Empire's forces could be divided into 7 armies. * Superhuman Battle Beasts: Led by General Julius Caesar, it is the largest of the seven armies. As the name suggests, most of this army's Battle Beasts are humanoid in shape. They often carry weapons such as swords, shields and spears. A whooping total of twenty-five appear in the series. * Spectral Battle Beasts: Led by General Hadias, this army specializes in inspiring fear in the enemies of the Mikene Empire. This army's forces tend to take the form of demons or ghosts. A total of three appear in the series, making it the lowest count of any warrior beast type. * Aerial Battle Beasts: The main air force of the Mikene Empire's forces, this army is led by General Birdler. Virtually every member of this army is winged, though some fly using thrusters or jets. A total of six appear in the series. * Mammalian Battle Beasts: One of the Mikene Empire's ground forces, this army is led by the vile General Ligern. The Battle Beasts of this army are based on mammals, many of them being four-legged. Ramming targets seems to be a favorite tactic. An above average total of nine appear in the series. * Reptilian Battle Beasts: Commanded by the dragon-like General Draydou, this army has a mix of air and ground troops. Being based on reptiles, the Battle Beasts of this unit tend to be more vicious than most. A total of six appear in the series. * Aquatic Battle Beasts: The navy of the Mikene Empire is led by General Angoras. This army is strongest in the water, though many Warrior Beasts that are part of this army are amphibious. A total of six appear in the series. * Insect Battle Beasts: Tough and adaptable, this army follows their leader General Scarabeth into battle. Like the Reptilian Batt;e Beast army, this force has a combination of air and ground troops; although leaning more towards air power. A total of four appear in the series, making them the second least common warrior beasts after spectral types. All seven armies are beneath the supreme command of the Great General of Darkness. After his defeat and death at the hands of Great Mazinger, the Great Marshall of Hell took over the supreme command. However, it can be noted that there is an unofficial eighth battle beast army; the Chouhou or Multicapable/Intelligence (or convenience) Battle Beasts. These are more robotic and mechanical in nature than other Battle Beasts and displayed characteristics that could not be easily classified into one of the seven normal armies. In addition, they share the same name as Minister Argos, implying the robotic factor of the beasts. Another title for them could have also been Indeterminate Battle Beasts. Monsters Dante (front), Saraga (left) and Raigon (right). =In other media= Various battle beasts have appeared in the majority of Super Robot Wars titles including Obeleus, Zugar, Psychoveia, Gracious, Tollukan, Dolark, Jerunicas, Jiran, Dukaider, Gogler, Gold Phoenix, and Vulcania from the series and Dante, Saraga, and Arsoth from Mazinger Z vs. The Great General of Darkness; the Mazinkaiser version of Dante and Psychoveia are the only true battle beasts in Super Robot Wars Judgment and W with others being the seven generals of the Mikene Empire led by the Great General of Darkness. The generals Julicaeser, Birdler, Hadias, and Draydou have few appearances, the former two only having their original versions appear in Super Robot Wars Alpha 2 while the latter two also appear in Super Robot Wars 4. All seven generals appear in their Mazinkaiser versions in Super Robots Wars Judgment and Super Robots Wars W, although only Draydou, Birdler, and Hadias are actual units. =Great Mazinger Weapons= *Atomic Punch - „Ç¢„Éà„Éü„ÉÉ„ÇØ „Éë„É≥„ÉÅ: Great Mazinger launches his fist, together with his forearm, giving a spinning effect to make the impact of the fist very powerful. *Mazinger Blade - „Éû„Ç∏„É≥„Ç¨„Éº „Éñ„É¨„Éº„Éâ: From his legs, a couple of swords can be launched, for melee attacks or duels. *Great Boomerang - „Ç∞„É¨„Éº„Éà „Éñ„Éº„É°„É©„É≥: The great red \\"V\\" plate on his chest can be picked up and thrown at enemies, with a boomerang effect. *Navel Missile - „Éç„Éº„Éñ„É´ „Éü„Çµ„Ç§„É´: From his waist, the light blue cell is opened, and a strong missile is launched from there. *Great Typhoon - „Ç∞„É¨„Éº„Éà „Çø„Ç§„Éï„Éº„É≥: From Great Mazinger's mouth, a powerful breath of wind is sent off, strong enough to lift up even a giant monsters. *Breast Burn - „Éñ„É¨„Çπ„Éà „Éê„Éº„É≥: From is great red \\"V\\" plate on his chest, a powerful heating beam is cast off. It can be converted to be a glacial beam. *Thunder Break - „Çµ„É≥„ÉÄ„Éº „Éñ„É¨„Ç§„ÇØ: Great Mazinger signature move. From his antennas on his ears, an electric beam is sent to the sky. Those beams makes the clouds to eletrify and to send giant thunderbolts on the earth. Some of this thunderbolts are caught by Great Mazingers antennas, and this tremendous energy is released from his finger or the tip of Mazinger Blade to the enemy, most probably killing it instantly. *Drill Pressure Punch - „Éâ„É™„É´ „Éó„É¨„ÉÉ„Ç∑„É£„Éº „Éë„É≥„ÉÅ: In order to make the Atomic Punch more dangerous, this is, later in the series, powered up by a set of sharp blades that make their appearance on the forearm only before the attack, making the Atomic Punch to be more powerful than the normal Atomic Punch. *Back Spin Kick - „Éê„ÉÉ„ÇØ „Çπ„Éî„É≥ „Ç≠„ÉÉ„ÇØ: In order to make the Great Mazinger flawless, the professors discovered that Great Mazinger's weak points are his legs, because there are no weapon on them. So, in order to correct this fault, a giant round blade appears from the knee to the foot, to make his kicks very powerful. However, this weapon is used rarely. *Knee Impulse Kick - „Éã„Éº „Ç§„É≥„Éë„É´„Çπ „Ç≠„ÉÉ„ÇØ: As just said, together with Back Spin Kick, another weapon is discovered for Great Mazinger's legs. From the plate on his knee, a metal tip is shown from his knees, in order to make his knee strike more powerful. However, this weapon is used rarely. *Great Booster - „Ç∞„É¨„Éº„Éà „Éñ„Éº„Çπ„Çø„Éº: Great Mazinger's best weapon and improvement. A separated jet is built and dispatched from the base, to fuse with great Mazinger \\"Scranduru Jet\\" and to improve his top speed. This improvement is also a weapon because it can be dispatched from Great Mazinger to the enemy, destroying it at impact. His sharpened wings may cut through enemies. The Great Booster is equipped with laser cannons, rarely used. See also *UFO Robot Grendizer tai Great Mazinger *Grendizer, Getter Robot G, Great Mazinger: Kessen!

This term can also be used to emphasize the view of such a system as a single entity that interacts with external environment. A manual system consists of hand tools and other aids which are coupled by a human operator who controls the operation. Operators of such systems use their own physical energy as the power source. The system could range from a person with a hammer to a person with a super- strength giving exoskeleton. Human machine system engineering is different from the more general and well known fields like human‚Äìcomputer interaction and sociotechnical engineering in that it focuses on complex, dynamic control systems that often are partially automated (such as flying an airplane). It also studies human problem-solving in naturalistic settings or in high- fidelity simulation environments. Human‚Äìmachine choreography The area of human‚Äìmachine choreography is yet to be extensively explored. How body- structure can be extended through machine mechanisms points to how the body can perform beyond its biological form and functions as well as beyond the local space it inhabits. How human movement is transduced into machine motion and then can be both expressed and extended into virtual performance on the web promises new possibilities in both conceptual approach and aesthetic application. For example, incorporating virtual camera views of the performing human‚Äìmachine system enriches the choreography and intensifies the artistic result. The Muscle Machine The Muscle Machine is a hybrid human‚Äìrobot walking machine. Designed by artist James Stelarc (who has also created other such systems), it is an exoskeleton with six robotic legs that are controlled by the leg and hand movements of its pilot. =Mechanism= The rubber muscles contract when inflated and extend when exhausted. This results in a more reliable and robust engineering design. The body stands on the ground within the chassis of the machine, which incorporates a lower body exoskeleton connecting it to the robot. Encoders on the hip joints provides the data that will allow the human controller to move and direct the machine as well as vary the speed at which it will travel. The action of the human operator lifting a leg lifts the three alternate machine legs and swings them forward. By turning its torso, the body makes the machine walk in the direction it is facing. Thus the interface and interaction is more direct, allowing an intuitive human- machine choreography. The walking system, with attached accelerometer sensors generates data that is converted to sounds that augment the acoustical pneumatics and machine mechanism operation. Once the machine is in motion, it is no longer applicable to ask whether the human or machine is in control as they become fully integrated and move as one. The six-legged robot both extends the body and transforms its bipedal gait into a 6-legged insect-like movement. The appearance and movement of the machine legs are both limb-like and wing-like motion. In popular culture Human‚Äìmachine systems have been portrayed in the media on many accounts. Cyborgs, seen in movies such as The Terminator and Robocop, are fantastical depictions of what human-machine systems may, one day, look like.

He also worked as a goalkeeping coach at Brighton & Hove Albion during the 2014‚Äì15 season. Niemi spent much of his playing career in the Scottish Premier League (with Rangers, Heart of Midlothian) and the Premier League (with Southampton and Fulham), and in 2008 announced his retirement due to injury. However, in 2009 he returned to sign for Premier League club Portsmouth, although he did not make any appearances before leaving in 2010. Club career =Early career= Niemi was born in Oulu, Finland and began his professional career with HJK Helsinki, where he made over 100 appearances in four years, before transferring to FC Copenhagen in 1995. Impressive performances over the next two years saw a transfer to Scotland with Glasgow club Rangers. =Rangers= Niemi joined Rangers in 1997 and initially competed with Andy Goram and Theo Snelders for the goalkeeper position; he made seven appearances in all competitions in his first season at Rangers. The following season, 1998‚àí99, Niemi began the season competing with Lionel Charbonnier to be Rangers' goalkeeper. Niemi started the 1998 Scottish League Cup Final as Rangers defeated St Johnstone, however Stefan Klos was signed in December 1998 and immediately became Rangers' first choice. Rangers won the Scottish Premier League in the 1998-99 season, but Niemi only contributed seven league appearances. In fact, Niemi only made one Rangers appearance after Klos was signed, which came in the league against Motherwell in August 1999. Niemi also had a brief loan spell at Charlton Athletic late in 1999. =Hearts= Niemi moved to Edinburgh to join Heart of Midlothian in December 1999. He became a hero for Hearts fans in the three years he played at Tynecastle. He put in some fantastic performances which helped Hearts maintain their status as Scotland's best team outside the Old Firm. Niemi also became famous in Scotland for his ability to save penalties, demonstrating this skill when saving from Dundee United's Charlie Miller and Dunfermline Athletic's Scott Thomson. Niemi also played in European competition for Hearts against opponents such as Stuttgart. In a more light-hearted incident, Niemi was also famously during his time at Hearts the subject of a call during a phone-in on radio channel talkSPORT, in which a Scottish fan queried why Niemi had not been called up to the Scotland national team. When presenter Arthur Albiston told the caller that Niemi was in fact Finnish, the caller replied 'He's not finished, he's only 28!' Upon his retirement, Niemi recalled his time at Hearts, quoting: \\"it was all good. Looking back, everything went so well ‚Äì it was a lovely club, the team was doing well, I was playing well and we had a good manager in Jim Jeffries\\". =Southampton= After three seasons in Edinburgh, Niemi moved to Southampton in 2002. He played for Southampton in the 2003 FA Cup final against Arsenal, which the Saints lost 1‚Äì0; Niemi became the first goalkeeper to be substituted in an FA Cup final when he was replaced by Paul Jones during the game due to a calf injury. In a game against Fulham in the 2002‚Äì03 season, he came up for a corner in injury time with Southampton trailing 2‚Äì1. The ball fell at his feet and he crashed a shot against the crossbar, and Michael Svensson was able to turn in the rebound, salvaging a draw. In March 2004 he saved a Michael Owen penalty to help his team to a 2‚Äì0 win over Liverpool. There was much speculation regarding Niemi's future at Southampton with a host of leading Premier League clubs rumoured to be interested in his services, such as Manchester United and Arsenal. After Southampton were relegated in 2005 and failed to challenge for promotion in the following season, Niemi decided to return to the Premiership with Fulham, for whom he signed in January 2006. Niemi would describe being relegated as a \\"first bad experience in British football\\". =Fulham= Niemi was badly hurt in a freak accident during a match against Watford on 1 January 2007 when rushing out to head the ball; he toppled over his own defender, Carlos Bocanegra, and landed on his head. He was taken from the field of play on a stretcher after ten minutes of treatment, but was later cleared of any spinal injury. He was released from hospital later that night with only ligament and muscle damage to the neck. He remained Fulham's first choice keeper until 1 March 2008, when, following injury, he was replaced by Kasey Keller. On 3 September 2008, it was announced that he had retired from professional football due to a wrist injury. =Portsmouth= Despite announcing his retirement from the game the previous year it was confirmed on 28 July 2009 that Antti Niemi was in talks with Portsmouth. On 7 August, Niemi confirmed he had signed for Portsmouth on a one-year deal as backup to David James and to work with the goalkeeping coaches. On 24 March 2010, he was released from his contract, without making a single appearance for Portsmouth's first team. It was reported that Niemi earned almost ¬£450,000 during those eight months with Portsmouth. International career Niemi was first choice for the Finnish national team for almost a decade, before announcing his decision to retire from international football in 2005, but returned to the roster in 2007 playing a friendly game against Spain (0‚Äì0). He was capped 67 times by his country before this. On 2 March 2010, Niemi joined Finland's national team as a goalkeeping coach. Coaching career Niemi began his coaching career as the goalkeeping coach for the Finland national team in March 2010. On 3 January 2013, his first club and reigning Veikkausliiga champions HJK announced that they had appointed Niemi as the club's goalkeeping coach and that he would continue his duties with the national team. On 27 June 2014, Niemi was appointed goalkeeper coach at Championship side Brighton & Hove Albion by former Finland teammate Sami Hyypi√§.

He pursued academic studies at the University of Paris where he studied contemporary literature. He also studied literature at University of Freiburg for two years during off-hours from his military service. At Columbia University he was a student of Paul Lazarsfeld and Robert K. Merton and received a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1961. The dissertation was published in the book Organizational Scientists: Their Professional Careers. Post-doc Glaser started a research collaboration with Anselm Strauss at the University of California, San Francisco. Together they wrote Awareness of Dying (1965) based on a study of dying in Californian hospitals. The book was a success. As a response to the many methodological questions on the dying study the first grounded theory (GT) methodology appeared in 1967 co-authored with Strauss: The Discovery of Grounded Theory. In 1970 Glaser started the publishing company Sociology Press specializing in grounded theory methodologies and readers. The second grounded theory methodology was written by Glaser in 1978 (Theoretical Sensitivity). Thereafter, Glaser has published several readers of grounded theory and four more methodologies. He has traveled throughout the world giving workshops and seminars to many researchers. In 1998 Glaser received an honorary doctorate from Stockholm University.Gynnild & Martin, 2011 In 1999 Glaser founded the non-profit web based organization Grounded Theory Institute. He owned Cascade Acceptance Corporation, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2009. In July 2010, the bankruptcy trustee declared that the company had been insolvent for at least two years, and the case was converted from a reorganization to a liquidation.

He was the first person to successfully export a large, viable shipment of Brazilian rubber seeds to the British Empire. He did so under false pretenses. The British had long planned to create rubber plantations in Southeast Asia, and using Wickham's batch, the resulting plantations brought about the end of the Amazon rubber boom. Smuggling of rubber seeds Wickham took about a year to collect rubber seeds from commercial rubber groves in Brazil after having been commissioned opportunistically due to his presence in Brazil. Historian Warren Dean notes that it would have been odd for a British expat to collect so many seeds in broad daylight using local labor without local authorities having been aware of it. In fact, he had the permission of the rubber grove operators where he sourced his seeds. This contradicts the \\"piracy\\" narrative that Wickham later built in order to inflate his reputation to that of daring hero. He falsely declared 70,000 seeds as \\"academic specimens\\", a term the Brazilians frequently used to classify dead animals or plants, not viable seeds. They arrived in London's Kew Gardens on June 15, 1876. Within a few weeks, only 2,700 of the 70,000 smuggled seeds had successfully germinated. They were sufficient to jump-start widespread cultivation in Southeast Asia. Thirty years after the fact, Wickham claimed in 1908 that he was responsible for stealing about 70,000 seeds from the rubber-bearing tree, Hevea brasiliensis, in the Santar√©m area of Brazil in 1876. At the time, there was no law forbidding the export of seeds, although there was a requirement for an export licence, which Wickham obtained under false pretenses in Bel√©m). From the embellishments‚Äîsuch as having to hide from pursuing gunboats‚Äîadded to his original account it appears that Wickham was trying to make his actions more exciting than they were in fact. The Ayapua Boat Museum (Museo Barco Historicos) in Iquitos, Peru calls his actions \\"the greatest act of biopiracy in the 19th century, and maybe in history\\", citing that the seeds were never properly recorded on the ship's manifest and that the resulting plantations in Asia deflated the rubber boom in South America. The museum also claims that he was specifically paid by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew to collect the seeds.Ayapua Boat Museum exhibit as of 2019. https://casamorey.com/boat- museum/ He accompanied the seeds to the Royal Botanic Gardens,National Archives: Wickham, Sir Henry Alexander (1846-1928), Knight, explorer and planter ‚Äì Correspondence relating to the smuggling of rubber seeds from Brazil to Kew, accessed November 2017. from where seedlings were dispatched to British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), British Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia) and Singapore, (though the latter was not used for rubber), Africa, Batavia in Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta in Indonesia), and other tropical destinations, thus dooming the Amazon rubber boom. Economic impact Rubber plantations in Asia were more efficient and outproduced Brazil and Peru. This was because the Asian rubber plantations were organized and well-suited for production on a commercial scale, whereas in Brazil and Peru the process of latex gathering from forest trees remained a difficult extractive process: rubber tappers worked natural rubber groves in the southern Amazon forest, and rubber tree densities were almost always low as a consequence of high natural forest diversity. Experiments in cultivating rubber trees in plantations in the Amazon showed them to be vulnerable to South American rubber tree leaf blight fungus and other diseases and pests‚Äîessentially limiting South American rubber production to hunting-gathering rather than agriculture. In spite of decades of research in selecting highly productive and disease resistant rubber trees, many commercial rubber trees throughout the world are descended from the seeds Wickham took to Joseph Dalton Hooker in London. In Brazil, Wickham is labeled as a \\"bio-pirate\\" for his role in smuggling the rubber seeds that broke the South American monopoly. Life Henry Wickham was born in Hampstead, north London. Wickham's father, a solicitor, died when young Wickham was only four years old.Wickham History: Sir Henry Alexander Wickham (1846-1928) , accessed November 2017.Sir Henry Alexander Wickham - at bouncing-balls.com At age 20 he traveled to Nicaragua, the first of several trips to Latin and South America. Returning to England, he married Violet Carter in 1871, whose father would publish Wickham's writings. His first book Rough Notes of a Journey Through The Wilderness from Trinidad to Par√°, Brazil, by way of the Great Cateracts of the Orinoco, Atabapo, and Rio Negro, was published by W.H.J. Carter in 1872. He would take the entire family to Santar√©m, Brazil, where his mother, sister Harriette, and the mother-in-law to his brother, John, would all die by 1876.

Selection and coronation Cecilia Renata was a daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, of the House of Habsburg, and Maria Anna of Bavaria. Born in 1611 in Graz, she was chosen as bride by the Polish nobility. She married W≈Çadys≈Çaw on 9 August in Vienna by proxy, and then in Warsaw in person on 12 September 1637, and the same day was crowned at St. John's Cathedral. This was the first royal coronation outside of Krak√≥w, the historic, former capital of Poland, and this greatly angered the Polish nobility. A law was instigated to reserve coronations to Krak√≥w in 1638. Queenship Young and energetic, Queen Cecilia Renata soon began organising the royal court to her liking. She was popular, especially for her politeness. One noble wrote in his memoirs that she insisted other women sit with her, even though she was queen. Cecilia Renata could not remove her husband's mistress, Hedwig ≈Åuszkowska, by herself, so she arranged a marriage between Hedwig and Starosta Merecki, John Wypyski. In 1638, Cecilia Renata and W≈Çadys≈Çaw visited Vienna. Cecilia Renata advocated the Habsburg and pro-Catholic point of view and allied herself with the pro-Habsburg faction of chancellor Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski and pro-Catholic Albrycht Stanis≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. Her political opponent at the court was the faction of Adam Kazanowski, whose influence over King W≈Çadys≈Çaw, his childhood friend, diminished after her marriage. Kazanowski was allied with Chancellor Piotr Gembicki, who thus became one of her opponents. Her influence was strong for the first 2‚Äì3 years of marriage, and she had much to say about the royal nominations for important official positions. After 1638/1639 when W≈Çadys≈Çaw realised that Habsburgs were prepared to give him little assistance, her power waned, and he started to disregard her advice. Cecilia Renata kept in contact with her brothers and continued an intimate attachment with them; she also became friends with her sister-in-law Anna Catherine. She enjoyed music, concerts, theatre performances and this may have greatly influenced her husband, who was one of the founders of Polish national theatre and brought many famous and well-known artists and performers from all around Europe to the country. Pregnancies and death During her marriage she became pregnant three times: * Sigismund Casimir (1 April 1640 ‚Äì 9 August 1647) * Maria Anna Isabella (8 January 1642 ‚Äì 7 February 1642) * Stillborn daughter (23 March 1644 ‚Äì 23 March 1644) Cecilia Renata died the next day as a consequence of an infection, likely related to the childbirth. Following her sudden death, Cecilia Renata was deeply mourned by both W≈Çadys≈Çaw and the Royal Polish court. She also left a good impression on the public, mostly for her piety and good will.

The text, in its existing form, is at least 700 years old and is considered by many Ethiopian Christians to be a historically reliable work. It is considered to hold the genealogy of the Solomonic dynasty, which followed the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. It contains an account of how the Queen of Sheba (Queen Makeda of Ethiopia) met King Solomon and about how the Ark of the Covenant came to Ethiopia with their son Menelik I (Menyelek). It also discusses the conversion of the Ethiopians from the worship of the Sun, Moon and stars to that of the \\"Lord God of Israel.\\" As the Ethiopianist Edward Ullendorff explained in the 1967 Schweich Lectures, \\"The Kebra Nagast is not merely a literary work, but it is the repository of Ethiopian national and religious feelings.\\"Edward Ullendorff, Ethiopia and the Bible (Oxford: University Press for the British Academy, 1968), p. 75  Summary of contents  The Kebra Nagast is divided into 117 chapters, and is clearly a composite work; Ullendorff describes its narrative as \\"a gigantic conflation of legendary cycles.\\"Ullendorff, Ethiopia and the Bible, p. 141 This account draws much of its material from the Hebrew Bible and the author spends most of these pages recounting tales and relating them to other historical events. The document is presented in the form of a debate by the 318 \\"orthodox fathers\\" of the First Council of Nicaea. These fathers pose the question, \\"Of what doth the Glory of Kings consist?\\" One Gregory answers with a speech (chapters 3-17) which ends with the statement that a copy of the Glory of God was made by Moses and kept in the Ark of the Covenant. After this, the archbishop DomitiusDomitius is identified at the beginning of this section as \\"Archbishop of Rom\\" (i.e. Constantinople), and at the end as of Antioch. This person might be identified with Patriarch Domnus II of Antioch, who was deposed at the Second Council of Ephesus. E. A. Wallis-Budge identifies him with Patriarch Timothy III of Alexandria without any explanation. reads from a book he had found in the church of \\"Sophia\\", which introduces what Hubbard calls \\"the centerpiece\\" of this work, the story of Makeda (better known as the Queen of Sheba), King Solomon, Menelik I, and how the Ark came to Ethiopia (chapters 19-94). Although the author of the final redaction identified this Gregory with Gregory Thaumaturgus, who lived in the 3rd century before this Council, the time and the allusion to Gregory's imprisonment for 15 years by the king of Armenia make Gregory the Illuminator a better fit.Hubard notes that it is \\"a tendency common in Near Eastern writings to merge people of the same name.\\" (David Allan Hubbard, \\"The Literary Sources of the Kebra Nagast\\" (St. Andrews, 1954), p.253). Queen Makeda learns from Tamrin, a merchant based in her kingdom, about the wisdom of King Solomon, and travels to Jerusalem to visit him. She is enthralled by his display of learning and knowledge, and declares \\"From this moment I will not worship the sun, but will worship the Creator of the sun, the God of Israel\\" (chapter 28). The night before she begins her journey home, Solomon tricks her into sleeping with him, and gives her a ring so that their child may identify himself to Solomon. Following her departure, Solomon has a dream in which the sun leaves Israel (chapter 30). On the journey home, she gives birth to Menelik (chapter 32).The Kebra Nagast identifies the country Makeda gives birth to Menelik in as B√ÇL√Ç ZAD√éS√ÇRE(Y√Ç. At the age of 22, Menelik travels to Jerusalem by way of Gaza, seeking Solomon's blessing, and identifies himself to his father with the ring. Overjoyed by this reunion, Solomon tries to convince Menelik to stay and succeed him as king, but Menelik insists on returning to his mother in Ethiopia. King Solomon then settles for sending home with him a company formed from the first-born sons of the elders of his kingdom. This company of young men, upset over leaving Jerusalem, then smuggles the Ark from the Temple and out of Solomon's kingdom (chapters 45-48) without Menelik's knowledge. He had asked of Solomon only for a single tassel from the covering over the Ark, and Solomon had given him the entire cloth. During the journey home, Menelik learns the Ark is with him, and Solomon discovers that it is gone from his kingdom. The king attempts to pursue Menelik, but through the Ark's mysterious power, his son with his entire entourage is miraculously flown home to Ethiopia before Solomon can leave his kingdom. King Solomon then turns to solace from his wife, the daughter of the Pharaoh of Egypt, and she seduces him into worshiping the idols of her land (chapter 64). After a question from the 318 bishops of the Council, Domitius continues with a paraphrase of Biblical history (chapters 66-83). Specifically he focuses on the central element of lineage and royal blood lines that were prevalent at the time. He discusses heavily the intermixing of the royal families in order to preserve their own power and to ensure that their blood line survives. He does this by using each chapter to describe a specific family line, such as chapter 72 and 73 discussing the family tree of Constantine or chapters 74 and 75 to describe two separate seeds of Shem. In chapter 90, we see a heavy emphasis on God's law and rules he sets forth for his believers to follow, which he presents by choosing the house of Jacob to reign as kings and to spread God's message. The author then describes Menelik's arrival at Axum, where he is feasted and Makeda abdicates the throne in his favor. Menelik then engages in a series of military campaigns with the Ark, and \\"no man conquered him, on the contrary, whosoever attacked him was conquered\\" (chapter 94). After chapter 94, the author takes a step back and describes a more global view of what he had been describing in previous chapters. After praising the king of Ethiopia, the king of Egypt, and the book Domitius has found, which has established not only Ethiopia's possession of the true Ark of the Covenant, but that the Solomonic dynasty is descended from the first-born son of Solomon (chapter 95). Gregory then delivers an extended speech with prophetic elements (chapters 95-112), forming what Hubbard calls a \\"Patristic collection of Prophecies\\": \\"There can be little doubt that chapters 102-115 are written as polemic against, if not an evangel to, the Jews. These chapters seek to prove by OT [Old Testament] allegories and proof-texts the Messianic purpose of Jesus, the validity of the Ethiopian forms of worship, and the spiritual supremacy of Ethiopia over Israel.\\"Hubbard, \\"The Literary Sources\\", p. 39. Hubbard further speculates that this selection from the Old Testament might be as old as Frumentius, who had converted the Kingdom of Axum to Christianity.Hubbard, \\"The Literary Sources\\", p. 44. The Kebra Nagast concludes with a final prophecy that the power of Rome will be eclipsed by the power of Ethiopia, and describes how king Kaleb of Axum will subdue the Jews living in Najran, and make his younger son Gabra Masqal his heir (chapter 117). Origins According to the colophon attached to most of the existing copies, the Kebra Nagast originally was written in Coptic, then translated into Arabic in the Year of Mercy 409 (dated to AD 1225),Hubbard, \\"The Literary Sources\\", p. 358. and then into Ge'ez by a team of clerics in Ethiopia‚ÄîY…ôs·∏•aq, Y…ôm·∏•ar√§nn√§ ÀÄAb, ·∏§…ôzb√§-Kr…ôstos, ∆éndr…ôyas, Fil…ôpÃ£pÃ£os, and M√§·∏•ari ÀÄAb‚Äîduring the office of Abuna Abba Giyorgis and at the command of the governor of Enderta Ya'ibika Igzi'. Based on the testimony of this colophon, \\"Conti Rossini, Littmann, and Cerulli, inter alios, have marked off the period 1314 to 1321-1322 for the composition of the book.\\".Hubbard, \\"The Literary Sources\\", p. 352. Marcus (1994) indicated that the religious epic story was conflated in the fourteenth century by six Tigrayan scribes. Other sources put it as a work of the fourteenth century Nebura‚Äôed Yeshaq of Aksum. Other historians to consider the evidence date parts of it as late as the end of the sixteenth century, when Muslim incursions and contacts with the wider Christian world made the Ethiopian Church concerned to assert its character and assert Jewish traditions.S. Munro-Hay, The Quest for the Ark of the Covenant: The True History of the Tablets of Moses (London, 2006), 124-194. Careful study of the text has revealed traces of Arabic, possibly pointing to an Arabic Vorlage (prior version), but no clear evidence of a previous Coptic version. Many scholars doubt that a Coptic version ever existed, and that the history of the text goes back no further than the Arabic vorlage.Hubbard, for example, claims to have found only one word which points to a Coptic version. \\"The Literary Sources\\", p. 370. On the other hand, the numerous quotations in the text from the Bible were not translated from this hypothetical Arabic vorlage, but were copied from the Ethiopian translation of the Bible, either directly or from memory, and in their use and interpretation shows the influence of patristic sources such as Gregory of Nyssa.One example is that in chapters 106-107 all but three passages quoted also appear in Gregory of Nyssa's Testimonia adversus Judeos. Hubbard, \\"The Literary Sources\\", p. 39. Hubbard details the many sources that the compiler of the Kebra Nagast drew on in creating this work. They include not only both Testaments of the Bible (although heavier use is made of the Old Testament than the New), but he detects evidence of Rabbinical sources, and influence from deuterocanonical or apocryphal works (especially the Book of Enoch and Book of Jubilees, both canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and such Syriac works as the Book of the Cave of Treasures, and its derivatives the Book of Adam and Eve and the Book of the Bee).This is the stated aim of Hubbard's doctoral thesis, \\"The Literary Sources\\". Marcus thus describes it as \\"a pastiche of legends ... [that] blended local and regional oral traditions and style and substance derived from the Old and New Testaments, various apocryphal texts, Jewish and Islamic commentaries, and Patristic writings\\". Early European translations One of the earliest collections of documents of Ethiopia came through the writings of Francisco √Ålvares, official envoy which king Manuel I of Portugal, sent to Dawit II of Ethiopia, under Ambassador Dom Rodrigo de Lima. In the papers concerning this mission, √Ålvares included an account of the Emperor of Ethiopia, and a description in Portuguese of the habits of the Ethiopians, titled The Prester John of the Indies, which was printed in 1533. The Jesuit missionary Pedro P√°ez included a detailed translation of the Kebra Nagast through Menelek's return to Aksum with the Ark of the Covenant in his Hist√≥ria da Ethi√≥pia.Isabel Boavida, Herve Pennec, and Manuel Joao Ramos, eds. Pedro Paez‚Äôs History of Ethiopia, 1622. Vol. 1. Trans. Christopher J. Tribe. London: Hakluyt Society, 2011. p. 80-89. Completed in the early 1620s, the manuscript was not published in P√°ez's lifetime. However, it provided the foundation for many of the Jesuit accounts of Ethiopia that came after his, including those of Manuel de Almeida and Balthazar Telles.Boavida, et al., \\"Introduction\\", p. 29. Additional information on the Kebra Nagast was included by the Jesuit priest Manuel de Almeida in his Historia de Etiop√≠a. Almeida was sent out as a missionary to Ethiopia, and had abundant opportunity to learn about the Kebra Nagast at first hand, owing to his excellent command of the language. His manuscript is a valuable work. His brother, Apollinare, also went out to the country as a missionary and was, along with his two companions, stoned to death in Tigray. In the first quarter of the 16th century, P.N. Godinho published some traditions about King Solomon and his son Menelek, derived from the Kebra Nagast. Further information about the contents of the Kebra Nagast was supplied by Baltazar T√©llez (1595‚Äì1675), the author of the Historia General de Etiop√≠a Alta (Coimbra, 1660). The sources of T√©llez's work were the histories of Manuel de Almeida, Afonso Mendes and Jer√≥nimo Lobo. Beginnings of modern scholarship of the book It was not until the close of the eighteenth century when James Bruce of Kinnaird, the famous Scottish explorer, published an account of his travels in search of the sources of the Nile, that some information as to the contents of the Kebra Nagast came to be generally known amongst European scholars and theologians. When Bruce was leaving Gondar, Ras Mikael Sehul, the powerful Inderase (regent) of Emperor Tekle Haymanot II, gave him several of the most valuable Ethiopic manuscripts and among them was a copy of the Kebra Nagast. When the third edition of his Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile was published in 1813, a description of the contents of the original manuscript was included. In due course these documents were given to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University (shelfmark Bruce 87).Phillipson, Daniel 'Foundations of an African Civilisation: Aksum and the Northern Horn, 1000 BC - AD 1300' (Rochester, NY: 2012) pp66 Although August Dillmann prepared a summary of the contents of the Kebra Nagast, and published its colophon, no substantial portion of the narrative in the original language was available until F. Praetorius published chapters 19 through 32 with a Latin translation.Fabula de Regina Sabaea apud Aethiopia. Dissertation. (Halle: 1870). However 35 years passed before the entire text was published by Carl Bezold, with commentary, in 1905. The first English translation was prepared by E. A.

During the firefight, FBI Special Agents Jerry L. Dove and Benjamin P. Grogan were killed, while five other agents were wounded. The two robbery suspects, William Russell Matix and Michael Lee Platt, were also killed. The incident is infamous in FBI history and is well-studied in law enforcement circles.

While in basic training, Platt applied for Army Airborne Ranger Training and subsequently entered Paratrooper Air Assault School at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. On completion of jump school, Platt was assigned to the Military Police Unit. It was in this unit that he met and served with Matix. This is also where he met his first wife, Regina Lylen. He was honorably discharged in 1979. Both men's former wives had died under violent circumstances. Matix's wife, retired U.S. Army Specialisthttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/18131128/patricia-m_-matix Patricia Buchanich, and a female co-worker, Joyce McFadden, were stabbed to death on December 30, 1983 at Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, where both women worked. Both were found murdered in the hospital laboratory. They had been bound, gagged with throats slashed.Federal Bureau of Investigation. 1986, Shooting Incident / 4-11/86 / Miami, FL (File Number 89-6047). Department of Justice. Matix reportedly told investigators he suspected Platt had carried on an affair with his wife. Matix was a suspect in the murders but was never charged. After his wife's death, Matix moved to Florida at Platt's urging, married Brenda Horne, and had one daughter, Christy Lou. Matix began a landscaping and tree removal business, \\"Yankee Clipper Tree Trimming Service\\", in Miami with Platt. Platt's first marriage ended in divorce. In December 1984, Platt's second wife, Regina E. Lylen-Platt, whom he had married nine years earlier in 1975, was found shot dead with a shotgun from a single shot in the mouth. Her death was ruled a suicide. He married his third wife, Brenda Horne, in January 1985. Before embarking on their crime spree, neither Platt nor Matix had a criminal record. At the time of Platt's killing, his wife had no idea that her husband and friend Matix were armed robbers. In the end, he was a father to an infant son whom he never met. On October 5, 1985, Platt and Matix murdered 25-year-old Emilio Briel while he was target shooting at a rock pit. The pair stole Briel's car and used it to commit several robberies. Briel's remains were found in March 1986 but not identified until May. October 10, 1985, five days after killing Briel, Platt and Matix attempted to rob a Wells Fargo armored truck that was servicing a Winn-Dixie supermarket. After ordering him to \\"Freeze\\", one of the pair shot a guard in the leg with a blast of 12 gauge OO buckshot from a shotgun while the other fired handgun and shoulder weapons from the getaway vehicle. Two other guards returned fire, but neither Platt nor Matix was wounded. No money was taken in the botched robbery, but the injured guard later died from his wound. A few weeks later on November 8, 1985, the two robbed robbed the Professional Savings Bank in Miami taking $41,469 in three Wells Fargo Armored Car Company money bags that had been delivered that morning. They resumed their robberies on January 10, 1986 by attacking a Brinks Armored Car Company courier as he opened the back door of his truck at Barnett Bank in Miami, FL. The attack was initiated by one of them shooting the guard in the back with a large gauge shotgun. Both approached the wounded guard and shot him two additional times with a military type .223 caliber weapon described by witnesses to be an AR-15 or M-16 style rapid firing rifle. The resulting investigation revealed the .233 caliber rifle used to murder the guard was obtained during the attack, and may have been the guard's issued weapon. After shooting the guard twice, they escaped with $54,000 in the gold 1977 Chevrolet Monte Carlo they had stolen from Emilio Briel. A civilian followed them from the scene and witnessed them switch to a white Ford F-150 pickup truck but lost contact thereafter. On March 12, they robbed and shot Jose Collazo as he was target shooting at a rock pit in the Florida Everglades, leaving him for dead and stealing his black Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Collazo survived the shooting and walked three miles to get help. One week later, on March 19, 1986 at 9:30a.m., carrying a short barrel pump shotgun and a military type shoulder weapon, possibly a MINI-14, they robbed the Barnett Bank branch. This was the same bank where they murdered and robbed the Brinks Armored Car courier a few months prior. $8,338 was stolen, with the suspects fleeing in the Collazo's Monte Carlo. The shootout Relative positions of FBI agents' and suspects' vehicles after a traffic stop at 12201 Southwest 82nd Avenue, Pinecrest, Miami, Florida. Illustration is not to scale. At 8:45 a.m on Friday April 11, 1986, a team of FBI agents led by Special Agent Gordon McNeill assembled at a Home Depot to initiate a rolling stakeout searching for the black 1979 Chevrolet Monte Carlo (Collazo's stolen car). The agents did not know the identity of the suspects at the time. They were acting on a hunch that the pair would attempt a robbery that morning. A total of 14 FBI agents in 11 cars participated in the search. Eight of these FBI agents took part in the actual shootout and were deployed as follows: * Supervisory Special Agent Gordon McNeill alone in his car * Special Agent Richard Manauzzi alone in his car * Special Agent Benjamin Grogan, with Special Agent Jerry Dove * Special Agent Edmundo Mireles, Jr., with Special Agent John Hanlon * Special Agent Gilbert Orrantia, with Special Agent Ronald Risner Around 9:30 a.m., agents Grogan and Dove spotted the suspect vehicle, and began to follow. Two other stakeout team cars joined them, and eventually an attempt was made to conduct a traffic stop of the suspects, who were forced off the road following collisions with the cars of FBI agents Grogan/Dove, agents Hanlon/Mireles, and agent Manauzzi. These collisions sent the suspect car nose first into a tree in a small parking area in front of a house at 12201 Southwest 82nd Avenue, pinned between a parked car (on its passenger side) and Manauzzi's car on the driver side. Of the eight agents at the scene, two had Remington 870 shotguns in their vehicles (McNeill and Mireles), three were armed with Smith & Wesson Model 459 9mm semi-automatic pistols (Dove, Grogan, and Risner), and the rest (six) were armed with Smith & Wesson revolvers; two had .357 Magnums and five had .38 Specials. Two of the agents had backup .38 Special revolvers (Hanlon and Risner) and both would use them at some point during the fight. The initial collision that forced the suspects off the road caused some unforeseen problems for the agents, as the FBI vehicles sustained damage from the heavier, older car driven by Matix. Just prior to ramming the Monte Carlo, Manauzzi had pulled out his service revolver and placed it on the seat in anticipation of a shootout, but the force of the collision flung open his door and sent his weapon flying. Hanlon lost his .357 Magnum service revolver during the initial collision, though he was still able to fight with his Smith & Wesson Model 36 backup weapon. The collision knocked off Grogan's glasses, and there is speculation his vision was so bad that he was unable to see clearly enough to be effective (a claim disputed by the FBI's medical director, who stated that Grogan's vision was \\"not that bad\\"). Grogan is credited with landing the first hit of the gunfight, wounding Matix in the forearm as he leaned out of the Monte Carlo to fire the shotgun at Grogan and Dove. Manauzzi was unable to recover his revolver and was wounded in the head and back by a shotgun blast, thought to be from Matix. McNeill fired over the hood of Manauzzi's car but was wounded by return fire from Platt. Platt then fired his rifle at Mireles who was running across the street to join the fight. Mireles was hit in the left forearm, creating a severe wound. Platt then pulled back from the window, giving Matix opportunity to fire. Due to collision damage, Matix could only open his door partially, and fired one shotgun round at Grogan and Dove, striking their vehicle. Matix was then shot in the right forearm.

Accessed 2009-03-11. Archived 2009-05-08. Aftermath A subsequent FBI investigation placed partial blame for the agents' deaths on the lack of stopping power exhibited by their service handguns. While a few of the agents were equipped with 9mm semi-automatic pistols, most of the agents owned revolvers which made up the majority of the weapons involved in the fight. The FBI soon began the search for a more powerful caliber cartridge to issue to all agents. Noting the difficulties of reloading a revolver while under fire, the FBI specified that agents should be armed with magazine-fed semi-automatic pistols. This incident contributed to the increasing trend of law enforcement agencies to switch from revolvers to semi-automatics across the United States. In the aftermath, the FBI initially chose the Smith & Wesson 1076 chambered for the 10mm Auto round, but its sharp recoil proved too much for most agents to control effectively, and a special reduced velocity loading was developed - commonly referred to as the \\"10mm Lite\\" or \\"10mm FBI\\". Soon afterwards Smith & Wesson developed a shorter cased cartridge based on the 10mm, the .40 S&W.;The 10mm and .40 S&W; are identical in projectile diameter, both using a 0.400\\" caliber bullet. This became more popular than its parent due to the ability to chamber in standard frame semi-automatic pistols initially designed for the 9mm Parabellum. Other issues were brought up in the aftermath of the shooting. Despite being on the lookout for two violent felons who were known to use firearms during their crimes, only two of the FBI vehicles contained shotguns (in addition to Mireles, McNeill had a shotgun in his car, but was unable to reach it before or during the shootout), and none of the agents was armed with a rifle. Only two of the agents were wearing ballistic vests, and the armor they were wearing was standard light body armor, which is designed to protect against handgun rounds, not the .223 Remington rounds fired by Platt's Mini-14 rifle. The other six agents involved in the stakeout in five vehicles, who did not reach the shootout in time to participate, did have additional weaponry including Remington shotguns, Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns, and M16 rifles.

Named for William Henry Elder, third bishop and Archbishop of Cincinnati, it was the city's fourth high school and first Catholic diocesan high school. Eventually, 12 other such schools were constructed in the Greater Cincinnati area. Eleven original parishes of the Western Hills neighborhood were the true founders of the school and served as \\"feeder parishes\\" for students. The first graduating class was in 1923, with eight students graduating in the year of the school's opening. Since its founding, over 20,000 students have graduated from the school. Elder educated girls as well as boys its first five years. In 1927, Elder's girls' department was transferred to Seton High School next door. To this day some advanced classes are still mixed, especially in technical subjects.  Academics  The school's curriculum is accredited by the Ohio Department of Education and the Ohio Catholic School Accrediting Association. Several levels of curriculum are provided. The school has an Honors Program which provides the top students Advanced Placement courses in Art, Calculus, Chemistry, Computer Science, English, World History, U.S. History, American Government, and Physics. In addition, Elder offers other level courses including (in order from most advanced to least) Honors+ (H+), Honors (H), Advanced College Prep (ACP), College Prep 1 (CP1), College Prep 2 (CP2), and General (G).

In the eleventh century it was a base for the Almoravid dynasty, who conquered a territory stretching from the Ghana Empire to Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula. The chronicler al-Bakri claims a fortress \\"surrounded by 20,000 palms\\" was built here by Yannu ibn Umar, a brother of the first Almoravid chieftains, Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni and Abu Bakr ibn Umar, and marked the frontier between the dominions of the Lamtuna and the Gudala.al-Bakri, in Levtzion and Hopkins (1981: p.73) Both of them Berber Sanhaja desert tribes and one time allies, the Lamtuna formed the core of the Almoravids after the Gudala broke away. It was near this location, at a place called Tabfarilla, that the early Almoravids suffered their first significant defeat, when the Gudala crushed an Almoravid Lamtuna army based in Azuggi and killed their leader Yahya ibn Umar in 1056. Azuggi and the nearby battlefield subsequently became a revered site for the Almoravids. The chronicler al-Zuhri, writing in the 1150s, called Azuggi the \\"capital of the Almoravids\\".al-Zuhri, in Levtzion and Hopkins (1981: p.95) Al-Idrisi identified Azougi as an essential stop on the trans-Saharan trade route between Morocco and Ghana (\\"Whoever wants to go to the countries of Sila, Takrur and Ghana in the land of the Sudan cannot avoid this town\\").al-Idrisi, in Levtzion and Hopkins (1981: p.127-28) He also notes that the \\"Guineans\\" (prob.

He was born in Chapelford, Enzie, Banffshire on 15 February 1772. His family had been farmers at Chapelford for hundreds of years. He was ordained to the priesthood on 25 March 1795. and came to Glasgow as a missionary in 1805. He built St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow (1814‚Äì16), which still stands on the River Clyde. In Glasgow, he built schools which could be used as chapels on Sunday, and meeting places during the week. He pursued and won a libel case against a Protestant activist, the case of Scott v McGavin, 25 June 1821. He was appointed the Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic of the Western District and Titular Bishop of Erythrae by the Holy See on 13 February 1827, and consecrated to the Episcopate at St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow on 21 September 1828. The principal consecrator was Bishop Alexander Paterson, Vicar Apostolic of the Eastern District of Scotland, and the principal co- consecrators were Bishop Ranald MacDonald, Vicar Apostolic of the Western District of Scotland and Bishop Thomas Penswick, Vicar Apostolic of the Northern District of England. On the death of Bishop Ranald MacDonald on 20 September 1832, he automatically succeeded as the Vicar Apostolic of the Western District. After John Murdoch was appointed as his Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic (assistant Bishop) on 4 June 1833, Bishop Scott was able to concentrate on the Highland part of the Western District, operating from Greenock. While he had concentrated on schools in the Lowlands and Glasgow, in the western Highlands, he attempted to restore liturgy by building churches. He built new buildings at Badenoch, Bornish, Fort Augustus, Morar and Glencoe. He resigned on 15 October 1845. The number of practising Catholics in the area increased from 1,000 to 70,000 during his forty-year tenure, largely due to Irish immigration. He died on 4 December 1846, aged 74, and was buried in St Mary's Church, Abercromby Street, Glasgow.

Tin whiskers were noticed and documented in the vacuum tube era of electronics early in the 20th century in equipment that used pure, or almost pure, tin solder in their production. It was noticed that small metal hairs or tendrils grew between metal solder pads causing short circuits. Metal whiskers form in the presence of compressive stress. Zinc, cadmium, and even lead whiskers have been documented. Many techniques are used to mitigate the problem including changes to the annealing process (heating and cooling), addition of elements like copper and nickel, and the inclusion of conformal coatings. Traditionally, lead has been added to slow down whisker growth in tin-based solders. Following the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS), the European Union banned the use of lead in most consumer electronic products from 2006 due to health problems associated with lead and the \\"high-tech trash\\" problem, leading to a re-focusing on the issue of whisker formation in lead-free solders. Mechanism Microscopic view of tin used to solder electronic components showing a whisker Metal whiskering is a crystalline metallurgical phenomenon involving the spontaneous growth of tiny, filiform hairs from a metallic surface. The effect is primarily seen on elemental metals but also occurs with alloys. The mechanism behind metal whisker growth is not well understood, but seems to be encouraged by compressive mechanical stresses including: * residual stresses caused by electroplating, * mechanically-induced stresses, * stresses induced by diffusion of different metals, * thermally-induced stresses, and * strain gradients in materials. Metal whiskers differ from metallic dendrites in several respects; dendrites are fern-shaped, and grow across the surface of the metal, while metal whiskers are hair-like and project perpendicularly to the surface. Dendrite growth requires moisture capable of dissolving the metal into a solution of metal ions which are then redistributed by electromigration in the presence of an electromagnetic field. While the precise mechanism for whisker formation remains unknown, it is known that whisker formation does not require either dissolution of the metal or the presence of an electromagnetic field.  Effects  Several mm long zinc whiskers on zinc coated steel Whiskers can cause short circuits and arcing in electrical equipment. The phenomenon was discovered by telephone companies in the late 1940s and it was later found that the addition of lead to tin solder provided mitigation. The European Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS), that took effect on July 1, 2006, restricted the use of lead in various types of electronic and electrical equipment. This has driven the use of lead-free alloys with a focus on preventing whisker formation, see . Others have focused on the development of oxygen-barrier coatings to prevent whisker formation. Airborne zinc whiskers have been responsible for increased system failure rates in computer server rooms. Zinc whiskers grow from galvanized (electroplated) metal surfaces at a rate of up to a millimeter per year with a diameter of a few micrometres. Whiskers can form on the underside of zinc electroplated floor tiles on raised floors due to stresses applied when walking over them; these whiskers can then become airborne within the floor plenum when the tiles are disturbed, usually during maintenance. Whiskers can be small enough to pass through air filters and can settle inside equipment, resulting in short circuits and system failure. Tin whiskers don't have to be airborne to damage equipment, as they are typically already growing in an environment where they can produce short circuits. At frequencies above 6 GHz or in fast digital circuits, tin whiskers can act like miniature antennas, affecting the circuit impedance and causing reflections. In computer disk drives they can break off and cause head crashes or bearing failures. Tin whiskers often cause failures in relays, and have been found upon examination of failed relays in nuclear power facilities. Pacemakers have been recalled due to tin whiskers. Research has also identified a particular failure mode for tin whiskers in vacuum (such as in space), where in high-power components a short-circuiting tin whisker is ionized into a plasma that is capable of conducting hundreds of amperes of current, massively increasing the damaging effect of the short circuit. The possible increase in the use of pure tin in electronics due to the RoHS directive drove JEDEC and IPC to release a tin whisker acceptance testing standard and mitigation practices guideline intended to help manufacturers reduce the risk of tin whiskers in lead-free products. Silver whiskers often appear in conjunction with a layer of silver sulfide which forms on the surface of silver electrical contacts operating in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen sulfide and high humidity. Such atmospheres can exist in sewage treatment and paper mills. Whiskers over 20 ¬µm in length were observed on gold-plated surfaces and noted in a 2003 NASA internal memorandum. The effects of metal whiskering were chronicled on History Channel's program Engineering Disasters 19. Mitigation and elimination Several approaches are used to reduce or eliminate whisker growth with ongoing research in the area. =Conformal coatings= Conformal compound coatings stop the whiskers from penetrating a barrier and reaching a nearby termination and forming a short. These include barriers made of a ceramic or polymeric compound. Polymeric compounds tend to deflect the whisker away while ceramic chemistries prevent puncturing of the coating. =Altering plating chemistry= Termination finishes of nickel, gold or palladium have been shown to eliminate whiskering in controlled trials.Keun-Soo Kim, Suk-Sik Kim, Seong-Jun Kim, Katusaki Suganuma, ISIR, Osaka University, Masanobu Tsujimoto, Isamu Yanad, C. Uyemura & Co., Ltd., Prevention of Sn whisker formation by surface treatment of Sn plating Part II, TMS Annual Meeting, 2008 Tin whisker examples and incidents =Galaxy IV= Galaxy IV was a telecommunications satellite that was disabled and lost due to short circuits caused by tin whiskers in 1998. It was initially thought that space weather contributed to the failure, but later it was discovered that a conformal coating had been misapplied, allowing whiskers formed in the pure tin plating to find their way through a missing coating area, causing a failure of the main control computer. The manufacturer, Hughes, has moved to nickel plating, rather than tin, to reduce the risk of whisker growth. The trade-off has been an increase in weight, adding per payload. =Millstone Nuclear Power Plant= On April 17, 2005, the Millstone Nuclear Power Plant in Connecticut was shut down due to a \\"false alarm\\" that indicated an unsafe pressure drop in the reactor's steam system when the steam pressure was actually nominal. The false alarm was caused by a tin whisker that short circuited the logic board that was responsible for monitoring the steam pressure lines in the power plant. =Toyota accelerator position sensors false positive= In September 2011, three NASA investigators claimed that the tin whiskers they identified on the Accelerator Position Sensors of sampled models of Toyota Camry could contribute to the \\"stuck accelerator\\" crashes affecting certain Toyota models during 2005‚Äì2010. This contradicted an earlier 10-month joint investigation by The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a large group of other NASA researchers that found no electronic defects. However, in 2012 NHTSA maintained: \\"We do not believe that tin whiskers are a plausible explanation for these incidents...[the likely cause was] pedal misapplication.\\" Toyota also maintains that tin whiskers were not the cause of any stuck accelerator issues: \\"In the words of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, 'The verdict is in. There is no electronic-based cause for unintended high-speed acceleration in Toyotas. Period. According to a Toyota press release, \\"no data indicates that tin whiskers are more prone to occur in Toyota vehicles than any other vehicle in the marketplace.\\" Toyota also states that \\"their systems are designed to reduce the risk that tin whiskers will form in the first place.\\" See also * Monocrystalline whisker * Dendrite (metal) * Crystal growth * Gold-aluminium intermetallic * Impurity References External links * Images of silver whiskers NASA Electronic engineering Metallurgy ","title":"Whisker (metallurgy)"},{"id":"1378442","text":"Tarquinio Merula Tarquinio Merula (24 November 1595 ‚Äì 10 December 1665) was an Italian composer, organist, and violinist of the early Baroque era. Although mainly active in Cremona, stylistically he was a member of the Venetian school. He was one of the most progressive Italian composers of the early 17th century, especially in applying newly developed techniques to sacred music. Life He was born in Busseto. He probably received early musical training in Cremona, where he was first employed as an organist. In 1616 he took a position as organist at the church of S Maria Incoronata in Lodi, where he remained until 1621, at which time he went to Warsaw, Poland to work as an organist at the court of Sigismund III Vasa. In 1626 he returned to Cremona, and in 1627 became maestro di cappella at the cathedral there, but he only remained for four years, moving to Bergamo to accept a similar position in 1631. Alessandro Grandi, his predecessor, had died in the Italian plague of 1629‚Äì31 (which affected many cities in northern Italy, including Venice), and he faced the formidable task of rebuilding the musical institution there after many of its members had died. Unfortunately Merula got into trouble with some of his students, and was charged with indecency; he chose to return to Cremona, where he remained until 1635. During this period in his life he seems to have had numerous troubles with his employers, possibly of his own making; after fighting with the administrators at Cremona over a variety of issues, he returned to Bergamo, serving this time at a different church, but was disallowed from using any musicians from his former place of employment. In 1646 he went back to Cremona for the final time, serving as maestro di cappella at the Laudi della Madonna until his death in 1665. Music and influence Merula was a key figure in the early development of several forms which were to mature later in the Baroque era, such as the cantata, the aria, the sonatas da chiesa and da camera, variations on a ground bass, and the sinfonia. In sacred music Merula followed the lead of Monteverdi, and often used the techniques of the elder composer; however he also did some new things, such as writing motets for solo voice accompanied by strings. His publications of 1639, 1640, and 1652 include masses which are written using ostinato basses, including the Ruggiero and the Romanesca. Some of his music is reminiscent of the concertato style of Giovanni Gabrieli, and a modern sense of tonality prevails throughout. Merula's secular music includes solo madrigals with instrumental accompaniment, sometimes using the Monteverdian stile concitato tremolo effect, and in formal design prefiguring the later Baroque cantata with its division into aria and recitative. He wrote one opera, La finta savia, produced in 1643, and based on a libretto by Giulio Strozzi. Among his instrumental music are numerous ensemble canzonas, whose sectional structure looks ahead to the sonata da chiesa, and his writing for strings‚Äîespecially the violin‚Äîis exceptionally idiomatic, also looking ahead to the highly developed writing of the late Baroque. He also wrote canzonettas, dialogues, keyboard toccatas and capriccios, a Sonata cromatica, and numerous other pieces which display an interest in just about every contemporary musical trend in north Italy. A complete edition of his works was published in 1974 in Brooklyn, New York (T. Merula: Opere complete, ed. A. Sutkowski). A compilation of several of his solo vocal works was edited in 2012 by Phoebe Jevtovic, and samples can be found on her official website.

Goldfields are indicated by light brown shading: Bambuk, Bure, Lobi, and Akan. Aoudaghost (also transliterated as Awadaghust, Awdughast, Awdaghusht, Awdaghost, and Awdhaghurst) is a former Berber town in Hodh El Gharbi, Mauritania. It was an important oasis town at the southern end of a trans-Saharan caravan route that is mentioned in a number of early Arabic manuscripts. The archaeological ruins at Tegdaoust in southern Mauritania are thought to be the remains of the medieval town. History =Arabic sources= The earliest mention of Aoudaghost is by al-Yaqubi in his Kitab al-Buldan completed in 889-890 in which he described the town as being controlled by a tribe of the Sanhaja and situated 50 stages south of Sijilmasa across the Sahara desert.Tegdaoust is south of Sijilmasa so each stages would correspond to . \\"It is the residence of their king who has no religion or law. He raids the land of the Sudan who have many kingdoms.\\" From Ibn Hawqal writing in around 977 we learn that the distance from Aoudaghost to Ghana (presumably the capital of the Empire) was 10 days' journey for a lightly loaded caravan.. As Tegdaoust is north of Koumbi Saleh, the likely site of the Ghanaian capital, each stage would correspond to . Ibn Hawqal wrote that the \\"king of Awdaghurst maintains relations with the ruler of Ghana\\" which suggests that at that time Aoudaghost was not part of the Ghana Empire. He also mentions the trade in gold and writes that the king of Ghana is very rich because of his stocks of gold but that the kings of Ghana and Kugha \\"stand in pressing need of [the goodwill of] the king of Awdaghust because of the salt which comes to them from the lands of Islam.\\" The only detailed description that we have for the town is given by al-Bakri in his Book of Routes and Realms which was completed in 1068. Al- Bakri made use of earlier sources and it is likely that his description of Aoudaghost comes from the writings of Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Warraq (904-973) whose own account has not survived: > Then to Awdaghust which is a large town, populous and built on sandy ground, > overlooked by a big mountain, completely barren and devoid of vegetation. > ... there is one cathedral mosque and many smaller ones ... Around the town > are gardens with date palms. Wheat is grown there by digging with hoes, and > it is watered with buckets ... Excellent cucumbers grow there, and there are > a few small fig trees and some vines, as well as plantations of henna which > produce a large crop ... [there are] wells with sweet water. Cattle and > sheep are so numerous... Honey ... is abundant, brought from the land of the > Sudan. The people of Awdaghust enjoy extensive benefits and huge wealth. The > market there is at all times full of people... Their transactions are in > gold, and they have no silver. Most of the inhabitants ... are natives of > Ifriqiya [Tunisia] ... but there are also a few people from other countries > ... [They own] slaves so numerous that one person from among them might > possess a thousand servants or more. Al-Bakri also describes the capture of the town by the Almoravids which had occurred just a few years before he wrote his account: > In the year 1054-5 'Abd Allah b. Yasin invaded the town of Awdaghust, a > flourishing locality, and a large town containing markets, numerous palms > and henna trees. ... This town used to be the residence of the King of the > Sudan who was called Ghana before the Arabs entered (the city of) Ghana... > This (former) city was inhabited by Zenata together with Arabs who were > always at loggerheads with each other. ... The Almoravids violated its women > and declared everything that they took there to be booty of the community. > ... The Almoravids persecuted the people of Awdaghust only because they > recognized the authority of the ruler of Ghana. It is unclear from this text how long prior to the arrival of the Almoravids the town had been part of the Ghana Empire.; Al-Idrisi writing in Sicily in 1154 suggests that by the middle of the 12th century the town of Aoudaghost was in decline: \\"This is a small town in the desert, with little water. ... Its population is not numerous and there is no large trade. The inhabitants own camels from which they derive their livelihoods.\\" By the beginning of the 13th century the oasis town of Oualata situated to the east had replaced Aoudaghost as the southern terminus of the major trans-Saharan caravan route. Archaeology The archaeological site of Tegdaoust forms an artificial mound or tell extending for 12 hectares. It lies south of the Hodh depression and northeast of the small town of Tamchakett. Excavations were carried out between 1960 and 1976 by a team of French archaeologists. The earliest layers date from the 7-9th centuries with the first mud-brick structures in the late 9th to early 10th centuries. Some stone buildings were constructed in the 11th century. The town appears to have been partly abandoned at the end of the 12th century and was completely abandoned by the 15th although there was some resettlement two centuries later.  In fiction  The science fiction writer Bruce Sterling has dedicated a story to the town in his collection Crystal Express The story \\"Dinner in Audoghast\\" recalls a dinner at a rich merchant's house that takes place at the height of the thriving metropolis's influence, about the year 1000 AD. The dinner is described wherein the guests discuss business and local affairs. They hear that a notorious fortuneteller is in town and they invite him to join them. He tells them their future, and that the city will be destroyed very soon, leaving the once thriving metropolis as only a marginal note in history. \\"Dinner in Audoghast\\" by Bruce Sterling, 1985, reprinted online 2013  World Heritage Status  The archaeological site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on June 14, 2001 in the Cultural category.
