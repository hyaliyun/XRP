It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Olsztyn. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately south-east of Częstochowa and north of the voivodeship capital Katowice. The village has a population of 2,331. It contains the ruins of a 14th-century castle, which was located on a hill above the village.  Name and location  Olsztyn belongs to Lesser Poland, and lies on the Trail of the Eagles' Nests, a popular tourist trail, which was named after a chain of 25 medieval castles which the trail passes by, between Częstochowa and Kraków. Its original name was Holsztyn, which is a Polonized version of a German word Holstein (or Hohlenstein); the name refers to German settlers, who founded the village in the Middle Ages (see Ostsiedlung, Walddeutsche).  History  First mentions of Olsztyn come from the beginning of the 14th century. At that time, it was a settlement, founded by the castle. In 1448, King Kazimierz Jagiellończyk granted it Magdeburg rights town charter, together with a privilege to organize fairs, which spurred Olsztyn’s development. The town was located in western Lesser Poland, near the border with Silesia, and was destroyed in 1587, during the War of the Polish Succession. Further destruction was brought by the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660). Finally, the town completely burned in 1719, and Olsztyn, despite officially keeping its town charter, turned into a rural settlement. After the Partitions of Poland, Olsztyn since 1815 belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and the Russians reduced it to the status of a village in 1870.  Attractions  Near the castle in Olsztyn is the location of the parish church of St. John, built in 1722-26 by Jerzy Lubomirski. The church has the shape of a cross, with arms marked by two chapels. Inside there is a Baroque painting The Baptism of Christ, and three mummified bodies from the 18th century. At local cemetery there are bodies of hundreds of people, murdered by Germans during World War II. The Germans used local forests to carry out executions of inhabitants of Częstochowa and Radomsko, captured Home Army fighters, POWs and villagers. Altogether, there are almost 2,000 people. Furthermore, there are ashes of hundreds of Soviet POWs, shot by Germans in 1941-1944 (see Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs). The Jewish commune during World War II was intensely defended by the resident Poles who refused to let the Germans take away their Jewish population. This led to barn burning and a large cull of horses in the area, which made the wandering Romany Gypsies easy targets for the oncoming Germans.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Przyrów. It lies approximately east of Częstochowa and north-east of the regional capital Katowice. The village has a population of 1,222. Przyrów is part of historic province of Lesser Poland, and for centuries it belonged to Kraków Voivodeship. It was a town between 1369 and 1869. Przyrów received Magdeburg rights town charter from King Kazimierz Wielki, in the year 1369, in a location of the village of Komorów. Following other medieval towns of Europe, Przyrów had a market square, and several streets. Its first wójt was Jakub Rechicki of Nagłowice, and town’s privileges were confirmed by several other Polish kings. In the 14th century Przyrów emerged as an important center of beer production. Until the Partitions of Poland, the town was part of Lelów County, Kraków Voivodeship. It was a royal town, with a voigt and a council. In 1620, it had 136 houses, and prospered together with whole Lesser Poland (see Polish Golden Age). On November 8, 1655, Przyrów was completely destroyed in the Swedish invasion of Poland, and the town never recovered from the destruction. After the invasion, the number of still existing houses was reduced to 55, and the population shrank to 330. In early November 1655, Swedish troops under General Burchard Müller von der Luhnen (who also commanded the Siege of Jasna Góra) demanded large amounts of bread, oats, meats, beer, butter and hay. Since residents of Przyrów did not have enough goods, von der Luhnen ordered the destruction of the town. In 1793 Przyrów was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, as part of New Silesia. In 1807 it belonged to the Duchy of Warsaw, which in 1815 became Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In the early 19th century Przyrów had 222 houses and the population of app. 1,200. After January Uprising, Russian government turned it into a village. By 1880, the population grew to almost 2,500, with a 40% Jewish minority. In the Second Polish Republic and in 1945 - 1950, Przyrów belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. Since 1950, it has been administratively tied with either Katowice, or Częstochowa.

He also played professional football for the Buffalo All-Americans (1922) and the Columbus Tigers (1923). University of Michigan A native of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, Goetz graduated from Sault Area High School in 1915 and went on to study medicine and play football at the University of Michigan. Goetz played varsity football at Michigan for four years from 1917 to 1920. He started nine games as a left end in his freshman year and moved to the left tackle position in his sophomore, junior and senior years. Goetz was a star for at tackle on the undefeated 1918 Michigan Wolverines football team. In a season shortened to five games due to the deadly 1918 flu epidemic and war-related travel restrictions, the Wolverines were 5-0 and national champions. They shut out four of their opponents and outscored their opponents 96-6. In Michigan's first game against the University of Chicago in 13 years, Goetz scored a touchdown in the Wolverines' 13-0 victory. Goetz also had the key play in a 14-0 shutout over Ohio State. The game was scoreless when Ohio State attempted to punt out of its end zone, and Goetz broke through and blocked the punt which was recovered for a touchdown. He was selected as an All-Western Conference tackle in 1918. After an outstanding season in 1918, Goetz was elected as Michigan's captain for the 1919 season. He was elected captain for a second time for the 1920 season, becoming one of only three two- time Michigan football captain between 1893 and 1984, the others being Kirk Lewis (1975, 1976) and Robert Thompson (1981, 1982). In 1920, Goetz was described as \\"the mainstay of the Wolverine line and a player of exceptional ability.\\" In November 1920, Edward Speyer, football writer for the Detroit News wrote: \\"There is one star on the team, and that is Goetz, a great player. ... It is a line from poor to good, with one great spot where Goetz stood ...\\" He was selected in 1920 as a first team all-Western Conference player, and a second-team All-American by Walter Camp. Goetz cropped from 1919 team photo Goetz was also elected president of the University of Michigan Student Council in 1920 and attended the Midwest Student Conference as a Michigan delegate in April 1922. When he finished his college football career at Michigan, he had the distinction of having \\"played more minutes for Michigan than any other player in the university's history.\\" In a 1920 profile of Goetz, the Associated Press noted: \\"Perhaps his most notable distinction lies in the fact that no time has been taken out for him during any game in the four years that he has been in the Michigan machine.\\" While continuing his medical school studies at Michigan, Goetz also worked as an assistant line coach under coach Fielding H. Yost during the 1921 football season.https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1921fbt.htm Professional football In 1922, Goetz was offered $240 a game for 10 professional football games. Goetz asked his former coach Fielding H. Yost what to do, and Yost told him he would lose his \\"M\\" if he played professional football. According to Yost, Goetz tore up the contract, and Yost told a conference of football coaches in New York, \\"The loss of his 'M' wasn't worth $2,400 to Angus Goetz.\\" However, despite Yost's opinions, Goetz did later have a short run in professional football, playing nine games for the Buffalo All- Americans in 1922 and the Columbus Tigers in 1923. Goetz played professional football on the weekends while attending medical school. He later recalled, \\"We used to huddle in a hotel lobby before games to go over some signals. The game then wasn't like it is today.\\" Medical career Goetz completed his internship at the University Hospital in Ann Arbor in 1924. Goetz became a leading orthopedic surgeon in Detroit. He served in World War II and returned to Detroit in 1945 where he established an orthopedic practice in downtown Detroit. He went on to become the chief of orthopedics at Detroit Receiving Hospital, and continued to practice medicine until his retirement in 1972.

History Sources claim that the history of the Pławniowice village dates back to as early as 1317, however, the area was mostly a scenic woodland next to a large lake until 1737, when it was bought by a nobleman called Franz Wolfgang von Stechow. In 1789 it passed through a marriage to the wealthy noble clan of the Ballestrems, who built a fairy tale palace between 1882 and 1884. Designed by Constantine Heidenreich, the palace is a three-wing structure in the architectural style of Dutch neo-mannerism. It is known for its \\"contrast in colour and texture between the red brick walls and ornamental stone edging\\". The roofs are adorned by various turrets, towers, dormers and needles of different shapes and sizes. Moreover, the palatial site is also adjacent to a carefully planned landscape park alongside a water canal. The palace remained in the hands of the Ballestrems until the end of World War II when it was abandoned as the Red Army quickly approached the village. The palace was then looted and the lavish interiors were devastated. Following the war, the palace was owned by the Polish state and was neglected, which contributed to its deteriorated over time. Since 1993 it has undergone full renovation and is now a local tourist attraction.

The clan has no connection with the similarly named Clan Shaw of Tordarroch (commonly known as Clan Shaw) which is one of the Highland clans of the Clan Chattan Confederation. Clan Schaw does not have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms therefore the clan has no standing under Scots Law. Clan Schaw is considered an armigerous clan, meaning that it is considered to have had at one time a chief who possessed the chiefly arms, however no one at present is in possession of such arms. Uncertain origins In George Crawfurd's 18th century publication, History of Renfrewshire, he stated that the antiquary Sir George Mackenzie claimed the clan descended from \\"Shiach, a son of MacDuff Earl of Fife\\" from whom the clan took its name. It has also been said the clan descends from a second son of Duncan, Earl of Fife, who was cup bearer to the king of Scots. Later, the 18th century heraldist Alexander Nisbet claimed that the clan may have acted as cup bearers to Alexander II or Alexander III. There is however no real evidence to support any of these claims. Despite this, the arms of Schaw of Sauchie (the principal branch of the clan) allude to the office of cup bearer, and are blazoned as: Azure, three covered cups Or. In this way the arms are similar to those of the Butler family in England. Today members of Clan Schaw may wear a crest badge to show their allegiance to the clan. This crest badge contains the heraldic crest a demi savage Proper, and the heraldic motto I MEAN WELL. The crest within the crest badge is derived from the arms of Schaw of Sauchie. History The clan name Schaw is considered to be either a topographic name or a habitational name. The topographic name is for person who lived near a copse or thicket. It is derived from the Middle English s(c)hage, s(c)hawe from the Old English sceaga. The habitational name could be derived from several places named with these words.\\"Dictionary of American Family Names\\", Oxford University Press, \\" cited at Ancestry.com http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Shaw-family-history.ashx The earliest record of the lowland name is of John de Schau, who witnessed a deed in relation to the Abbey of Paisley in 1284. Another early recorded Schaw is William Schaw who witnessed a charter in 1291 to the Monastery of Paisley. In 1296, Symon de Schawe, Fergus de Shawe and William de Schawe of Lanark, all rendered homage to Edward I, king of England. Sometime before 1309, the clan acquired the lands of Hayley, Wardlaw and Drumchaber in Ayr from James, Great Steward of Scotland. In 1407, an agreement between John Schaw, lord of Hayley and Alan Cathcart was confirmed by charter under the great seal. John Schaw of Hayley was one of the men that made up the Embassy that negotiated the terms of marriage between James III and Margaret, daughter of the Christian I, king of Denmark. In 1477, a younger son of John Schaw of Hayley received the lands of Sornbeg and Polkemmet. The principal family within the clan was said to have been the Schaws of Sauchie (their residence, Sauchie Tower still stands in Clackmannanshire). A member of this family was John Schaw of Sauchie, who was Comptroller of the Royal Household to James III. Other branches or families within the clan were located in Kirkcudbrightshire and Ayrshire, and also around the towns of Greenock and Stirling.

Some Basque whalers went on a whaling expedition to Iceland and were killed after conflict in 1615 with local people in the region of the Westfjords. Background In the first half of the sixteenth century Basque whalers set up the world's first large-scale whaling industry in Newfoundland. The center of this industry was some ten ports on the southern coast of Labrador. During the peak years of the 1560s and 1570s the fleet comprised around 30 ships manned by up to 2,000 men, who killed approximately 400 whales each year. By the beginning of the seventeenth century Basque whaling had reached Iceland. Massacre The Westfjords The year 1615 was a difficult year in Iceland with ice up to shores until late summer and considerable loss of livestock. In mid-summer three Basque whaling vessels put into Reykjarfjörður in Westfjords. Icelanders and the Basques had a mutual agreement at the beginning as they both had benefited from the enterprise. When the ships were ready for departure in late September a terrible gale arose and the ships were driven on the rocks and crushed. Most of the crew members survived (approx. 80). The captains Pedro de Aguirre and Esteban de Telleria wintered at Vatneyri (Patreksfjörður) and left for home the following year. The crew of Martin de Villafranca's ship split into two groups; one entered Ísafjarðardjúp, the other went to Bolungarvík and later to Þingeyri. The first conflict arose when one group entered the empty house of a merchant of Þingeyri and stole some dried fish. As retaliation, on 5 October, at night, a group of Icelanders entered the hut where the Basques were sleeping and killed 14 of them, only one young man called García, escaped. Captain Martín de Villafranca of San Sebastián, whose father and grandfather had both been involved in Terra Nova whaling was among those who were killed. The bodies were mutilated and sunken into water. Jón Guðmundsson the Learned wrote about the unjust and cruel deaths \\"dishonored and sunken into sea, as if they were the worst pagans and not innocent Christians\\". Three days after the first slaying, Ari Magnússon summoned a council at Súðavík and twelve judges agreed to declare as outlaws all the Basques. On 13 October Martin and the other 17 of his group were killed at Æðey and Sandeyri in Ísafjarðardjúp, while they were fishing, by the troops commanded by Ari Magnússon. According to Jón Guðmundsson, the victims were stabbed in the eyes, their ears, noses and had their genitals mutilated. The captain, Martín de Villafranca, was injured in the shoulder and chest with an axe, but he managed to escape into the sea however he was stoned in the water and dragged to the shore where he was tortured to death. Two verdicts were instigated by sheriff Ari Magnússon of Ögur, Ísafjarðardjúp in October 1615 and January 1616. The Basques were considered criminals after their ships were wrecked and in accordance with the Icelandic law book of 1281 it was decided that the only right thing to do was to kill as many of them as possible. Over 30 Spaniards were killed. Aftermath Jón Guðmundsson the Learned (1574–1658) wrote a critical account condemning the decision of the local sheriff to order the killings: A True Account of Spanish Men's Shipwrecks and Slayings. Jón says that they were unjustly killed; not wishing to take part in an attack on them, he fled south to Snæfellsnes. In 2015, a memorial in honor of the killed Basques was unveiled, with the presence of Martín Garitano, then governor of the Gipuzkoa province in the Basque Country. In the occasion, Westfjords district commissioner Jonas Gudmundsson formally revoked Magnússon's 1615 decree.

It acts as a reboot to the original series. The games use a combination of close-combat and platforming gameplay, though more oriented on combat than previous games in the Spyro series. The story revolves around Spyro, the protagonist, and his efforts to stop Malefor, The Dark Master, from escaping his ancient imprisonment to bring about an armageddon upon the world. The games received mixed reviews; the games' controls and story received much praise, while the gameplay was often criticized as being repetitive.  Setting  The Legend of Spyro trilogy is set in a world populated by various creatures, with dragons being the most notable. Spyro is a young dragon who hails from a line of rare purple dragons who are born once every ten generations and prophesied to direct the fate of an era. While still an egg, he came under threat of The Dark Master Malefor, who sought to prevent the prophecies from coming true. Spyro's egg was saved by the Fire Guardian, Ignitus, who left it to drift down a river, hoping for the best. Adopted and raised by dragonflies, Spyro would soon discover who he is and his destiny to save his world and stop Malefor. Along the way, his adoptive dragonfly brother Sparx, follows Spyro loyally, helping Spyro find his way if he gets lost. Spyro would also encounter Cynder, a female dragon who was cursed by Malefor and was made to serve him. Cynder starts out as an antagonist, but later joins Spyro's side in the battle against Malefor's forces.  Games = A New Beginning = A New Beginning marked the third title in the Spyro series to be released on the PlayStation 2 and the Nintendo GameCube, and the second on the Xbox, released in October 2006 and developed by Krome Studios. Portrayed as a reboot to the franchise, Spyro is sent on a quest to find the captured Guardian dragons so The Dark Master does not return from his prison. An evil dragoness that is because she was bewitched named Cynder uses her dark minions to harness the power of the four Guardian dragons (fire, electricity, ice, and earth) in order to open The Dark Master's prison, for bringing terror throughout the lands. The cast includes Elijah Wood as Spyro, David Spade as Sparx, Gary Oldman as Ignitus, Corey Burton as Volteer, Jeff Bennett as Cyril, Kevin Michael Richardson as Terrador, and Cree Summer as Cynder. Although it was first advertised as a prequel to the first Spyro game, this game is in fact a reboot to the series, starting off from scratch and having nothing to do with the previous games. The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning has received average, but mostly decent reviews and ratings from critics, often in agreement as being a good start for the trilogy, but open for improvement on the future installments as well. = The Eternal Night = The Eternal Night was a sequel to A New Beginning, was released in October 2007 for the PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and Wii consoles and was once again developed by Krome Studios. In this game, the Ape King Gaul planned to free the Dark Master from the Well of Souls on the Night of Eternal Darkness, and Spyro—having faced several visions of the threat from the Chronicler, an ancient, wise dragon—embarked on a journey to stop him. Elijah Wood, Gary Oldman, Corey Burton, Jeff Bennett, and Kevin Michael Richardson reprised their roles for the game, with Billy West taking over the role for Sparx, and Mae Whitman taking over the role for Cynder. This entry also introduces an ability called \\"Dragon Time.\\" This feature allows Spyro to slow down time around him, making certain platforming segments and combat in general easier.The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night instruction booklet, pp. 7–8. The Eternal Night received less acclaim than its predecessor, usually in part to its difficulty, controls and usual linear setup. Regardless, its sales warranted for continuation, but also improvement of the trilogy. = Dawn of the Dragon = Dawn of the Dragon is the third and final installment in The Legend of Spyro trilogy, as well as the tenth anniversary game of the series. It was released in October 2008 for the Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 for North America, and was developed by Étranges Libellules. In the game, Spyro and Cynder awaken in the future, and set out to stop Malefor the Dark Master (the first purple dragon who turned evil), from spreading his evil across the world. Unlike previous Spyro games, this game features the ability to switch between Spyro and Cynder at any time. There is also a two player mode, with two players either playing as Spyro and Cynder simultaneously. Along with this new freedom comes \\"Free Flight\\", which allows Spyro and Cynder to fly at any time. Once again, Elijah Wood, Gary Oldman, Corey Burton, Jeff Bennett, and Kevin Michael Richardson reprise their roles while Billy West is replaced as the voice of Sparx by Wayne Brady, Christina Ricci replaces Mae Whitman as the voice of Cynder, and Blair Underwood voices Hunter of Avalar. Mark Hamill does the voice for Malefor, the Dark Master.  Gameplay  The trilogy features platforming gameplay similar to the rest of the Spyro series, though with a much heavier emphasis on combat. The levels in the games are linear in nature; the player guides Spyro along a set path, battling minor villains along the way, until he reaches a boss at the end of the level. The first game also features flying levels with rail-shooter gameplay. Spyro is capable of both close-quarter and long-range combat. Long range attacks consist of a variety of elemental breaths, specifically fire, electricity, ice, and earth breath.The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night instruction booklet, pp. 10. Spyro learns these breaths at various points throughout the games. He can also expel large blasts of these elements in an attack called a \\"Fury.\\"The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning instruction booklet, pp. 8–9.The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night instruction booklet, pp. 7–9. As Spyro uses his abilities, his magic meter is depleted. He can refill his meter and his health using specially colored gems found by defeating enemies and breaking parts of the environment.The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning instruction booklet, pp. 9.The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night instruction booklet, pp. 9. These gems can also be used to increase the strength of Spyro's attacks.The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning instruction booklet, pp. 6–7.The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night instruction booklet, pp. 7. The Eternal Night introduces an ability called \\"Dragon Time.\\" This feature allows Spyro to slow down time around him, making certain platforming segments and combat in general easier. Dawn of the Dragon features a number of other alterations. Spyro is given the ability to fly at will,The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon instruction booklet, pp. 6. allowing for more exploration. The game also features a two-player co-op mode, with player two controlling Spyro's friend, Cynder. If there is no player two, then the player may switch between Spyro and Cynder during gameplay. Cynder has her own elemental breath powers as well, described as most uncommon abilities gained from her exposure to the darkness - poison, fear, wind and shadow.  Development  The transition from traditional controllers in A New Beginning to the Wii remote in The Eternal Night proved challenging, as the cue system developed for the traditional controllers of the PlayStation 2 and GameCube didn't work for the Wii. The ultimate solution for this problem was found by Krome Studio's lead coder, who wrote a program to simulate how any action was performed, making it possible for developers to code that action for the Wii. However, the Wii Classic Controller can be used to play The Eternal Night on the Wii, since it is compatible.  Characters  * Spyro is a purple dragon that prophecies say will direct the fate of his era. He is the main protagonist in The Legend of Spyro series. He is compassionate for others and always willing to help. * Cynder was originally a large and powerful black dragon, who served as the primary antagonist in The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning. Corrupted by Malefor, she is fully grown despite being the same age as Spyro. After being defeated, she returns to her normal size and becomes Spyro's companion. In the beginning of Dawn of the Dragon, the Chronicler reveals that due to Cynder's exposure to darkness at the hands of the Dark Master, she has access to powers that are not of the four native elements: Poison, Fear, Wind and Shadow. Near the end of Dawn of the Dragon, she admits that she loves Spyro. * Sparx is Spyro's foster brother and a dragonfly. Sparx serves primarily as a traveling companion and the comic relief character. Sparx is also one of only two characters to have a different voice actor for all three Legend of Spyro games, being voiced by David Spade in A New Beginning, Billy West in The Eternal Night and Wayne Brady in Dawn of the Dragon. * Ignitus is a reddish-orange dragon and the Guardian of Fire. He is also the leader of the Four Dragon Guardians because of his brilliant strategies. He is the first Guardian Spyro meets at the beginning of his adventures, and due to Ignitus' very compassionate and caring demeanor, Spyro looks to Ignitus as a father figure. At the end of Dawn of the Dragon, he becomes the new age's Chronicler after taking over for the previous one. * Volteer is a yellow dragon and the Guardian of Electricity. He is very smart, but he has a habit of talking too much. He also has a slight stutter. * Cyril is a light-blue dragon and the Guardian of Ice. He is a wise and proud dragon with a dry wit and a slightly pompous attitude. * Terrador is a green dragon and battle-scarred warrior, and the Guardian of Earth. Terrador is the most militant Guardian. Dedicated and focused on the practical arts of battle, he is straightforward and agenda-less. He judges everyone, Spyro included, not by looks, color or species, but how well they fight. * Flash and Nina are the biological parents of Sparx and adoptive parents of Spyro. They find Spyro's egg, which hatches the same day as Sparx's egg, and raise Spyro as their adopted son. * Kane was introduced as proud and independent, refusing any help even when he was imprisoned. He was initially doubtful of Spyro's abilities at first, but soon grew to realize that Spyro can help him save his tribe. * Mole-Yair is the leader of the Manweersmalls (A play on the phrase \\"Man We're Small\\"), a race of moles that takes refuge underground in the Munitions Forge to hide from the volcano, Mt. Boyzitbig. (Also another play on words, \\"Boy Is It Big\\".) He is mainly seen as a guiding figure, instructing Spyro to save his people and his brother, Exhumor, in exchange for information on Terrador's location. * Gaul is the Ape King, who plans to resurrect Malefor in The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night in order to obtain revenge on the dragons. He is killed by Dark Spyro in a fit of rage, and his minions are cursed by Malefor. * The Chronicler is an ancient gray dragon who is over 1,000 years old and possesses telekinesis. He knows the past, present and pieces of the future of every dragon ever born. He helps Spyro reawaken his powers through a series of dreams and visions. Characters speculate that he might be blind. It should be known that \\"The Chronicler\\" is more of a title than it is a name, and that the Chronicler's color is actually a symbol of status. (This is observed when Ignitus becomes the new Chronicler and takes on the teal color of the previous Chronicler). * Hunter is a cheetah warrior who lives in the Valley of Avalar. In The Eternal Night, he has heard of Spyro and hopes that one day they will meet. In Dawn of the Dragon, Hunter finally meets Spyro after saving him, Sparx, and Cynder from the Catacombs on orders from Ignitus. * Malefor, also known as the Dark Master, is the main villain of the trilogy. Malefor was said to be the first purple dragon ever to be born, but he later claimed that there were many before him. Being a purple dragon, he quickly learned to use every element despite not being a dragon of those elemental types. He developed a belief that the role of the purple dragons is to resurrect an ancient monster called The Destroyer and bring about the end of the world. Realizing that he was corrupt, the Ancients banished him, and his own monstrous power brought about his first downfall. The ruins of his first fortress became known as the Mountain of Malefor, or the Well of Souls, where the souls of evil beings gravitate towards. He was accidentally set free by Spyro and Cynder, and set about continuing his quest, and almost succeeded, but was defeated by Spyro and Cynder and sealed away forever by the spirits of the Ancients.  Universe = Locations = The Dragon Temple was an ancient temple located not far from the swamp where Spyro was raised. It is used by the Guardians to train young dragons. It was abandoned after the events of The Eternal Night when the Guardians left for Warfang during the three-year time skip between the game and Dawn of the Dragon. = Items = Gems are used as powerups themselves; red are collected to fill up Spyro's health bar, green are used to power his breath attacks, purple to power his fury attacks, and blue to upgrade his abilities in the main menu. In The Eternal Night, Dragon Relics are collectibles used to upgrade Spyro's health and magic bars, while Scriber's Quills are collectible items used to unlock concept art. Dragon Armor are collectibles in Dawn of the Dragon used to give Spyro and Cynder additional abilities in combat.  Music  Rebecca Kneubuhl and Gabriel Mann, previously members of the a cappella band Spiralmouth who also composed musical pieces for Crash Twinsanity and Crash Tag Team Racing from Spyro's companion franchise Crash Bandicoot, composed many of the musical pieces for each game of The Legend of Spyro trilogy. Kneubuhl and Mann have also performed songs with lyrics which are based on the protagonist's bonds with his closest allies, such as \\"This Broken Soul\\" in The Eternal Night, and \\"Guide You Home (I Would Die for You)\\" in Dawn of the Dragon.

Daniel and Steven Altiere wrote the script, which was going to be based on the recently released The Legend of Spyro trilogy. The film was going to be titled The Legend of Spyro 3D and was planned to be made from Los Angeles, California, with animation by a South Korean Animation studio, Wonderworld Studios, alongside Universal Animation Studios. The film was planned to be produced by John Davis, Dan Chuba, Mark A.Z. Dippé, Brian Manis and Ash Shah, and distributed and advertised by Velvet Octopus along with Universal Studios. Mark Dippe was going to direct the film, which would've made it the first theatrical film Dippe directed since Spawn. This film was originally planned for released in theaters on Christmas 2009 for the United States and Canada, but it was delayed to April 10, 2010 for its North American release. It was later confirmed by Daniel Altiere himself that the movie had been officially cancelled due to decisions made by Activision to go in a different direction, which was later revealed in the form of Skylanders.  Reception  Critical reception of the games was mixed. IGN was highly impressed by A New Beginning, citing its story, voice acting, and controls as major positives. At one point, they compared the game to God of War. GameSpot, on the other hand, wasn't impressed, calling the story dull, the gameplay repetitive, and the levels uninspired. The Eternal Night was not as well received. IGN called the game \\"pointlessly difficult,\\" citing an unresponsive jump button during platforming segments and \\"unfair\\" combat mechanics. GameSpot also complained about the high difficulty, saying that the game's \\"Dragon Time\\" was required to simply stay alive. Game Chronicles was kinder; while they did not like the game's lack of precision or its difficulty, and really did not like some of the acting, they also said that a patient player would find a lot about the game to like, particularly the production values. Dawn of the Dragon was better received than the previous two. IGN said that while the gameplay was still repetitive, the flight mechanic and other new features were welcome additions. GameZone was unimpressed by the game's graphics and multiplayer, but referred to the production values, including score and voice acting, as \\"epic.\\" Impulse Gamer believed that the game was targeted at a young audience, who they say will enjoy the flight mechanic over all else.

Although other organisms can be involved, bacteria culture frequently shows Staphylococcus aureus. Primarily found on the rib cage, neck, and shoulder, lesions are often irregular, circumscribed, and moist. Intense itching may lead to scratching which may aggravate and perpetuate the lesion. Destruction of the epidermis along with underlying pustules or abscesses, and granulomatous inflammation, may be present. In cases where topical treatment alone does not resolve the dermatitis and irritants are not known, a secondary bacterial, fungal or yeast infection might be present and may require an anti- fungal or antibiotics to be prescribed by the veterinarian to affect a cure. In rats, this skin disorder may be observed on the neck and head, often secondary to skin trauma from scratches or fighting.

He is best known as a prolific librettist. Gamerra was born in Livorno, and worked from 1771 at the Teatro Regio Ducale in Milan – an important centre for opera at the time. Operas based on his librettos include Sarti's Medonte, re di Epiro and Josef Mysliveček's Il Medonte, Paisiello's Pirro, several operas by Antonio Salieri and Mozart's Lucio Silla (though this libretto was modified by Metastasio). His Erifile was set by several composers. De Gamerra is also said to have been the first translator of Mozart's Die Zauberflöte into Italian. His librettos are in the grand, orderly tradition of Metastasio, but incorporate progressive elements with enhanced use of chorus, ballet, and elaborate scenery. In 1793, aided by his reputation as a protégé of Metastasio, he was appointed as court librettist in Vienna, and he took to combining comic and serious features to please Viennese taste. De Gamerra was politically active, and by his revolutionary attitudes incurred the wrath of Emperor Leopold II, who tried unsuccessfully to block his career. He died at Vicenza.

They honestly want to disband after the performance at the school festival because they had to study for entrance exams or look for jobs, but they were convinced to go on a live tour by Yagihara, the vocalist of Star Generation. Shikanosuke's band d2b begins its live tour across Japan in an old van. Characters Note: Voice actresses for the three main heroines are for the PS2 version. The cast for the PC version is not announced (possibly due to it being an adult game). =d2b band= ; : Shikanosuke is the protagonist of Kirakira. He used to be in the tennis club with his best friend, Murakami. In the beginning of the story, he gets dumped by his girlfriend and quits the tennis club due to health problems. In the d2b (second literature club) band, he joins as Shikako Maejima, a red-headed girl with hearing problems. This way they can try to become an all-girls band. He plays a Fender-styled bass guitar in the band. Throughout the Sarina and Chie Route, he revealed that his biological father died when he was 5 and his current father is not his real father. However, he respects him a lot for raising him until this day. ; : Voiced by: Tomoko Nakamura : Kirari is the girl who Shikanosuke meets at a sake bar where he works as a part time worker. Since her house is very poor, she works many jobs to help her family. She is a cheerful character who initially wants to play drums in the band, but is persuaded by Chie to become the vocalist. She is the band's vocalist and second guitarist, using a Gibson Les Paul Junior. She has special talents and an extraordinary memory, and seems to be attending the high school under an academic scholarship. She has a voice which people describe as genius, but her huge vocabulary causes her trouble when carrying on normal conversation with others. She also comes across a bit of an oddball to the other students, so she doesn't have many friends. She admits she would go out with Shikanosuke before the tour during the fireworks display during the festival. In her route (normal), because of poverty and a loan shark, she is forced to drop out of school and interviews for a job in the adult industry (arranged by the loan shark). :In the Normal Ending, her father starts a fire on her house because he cannot stand the burden of debt anymore, leading to Kirari's death at the end of chapter 3. This leads to Shikanosuke's traumatic breakdown, resulting in his failing an entrance exam and later joining his friend's band, the Happy Cycle Mania. In the end of chapter 4, he overcomes his sadness and composes a song from Kirari's humming voice on the cassette tape she left in her bag the day her house burned. :In the True End (after viewing the 3 heroines' normal ends), instead of going home after meeting with Kirari at her house, Shikanosuke forcefully makes her tell him the truth about where she will be working. However, he is unable to solve her family problems and depressed, breaks up with her. This break-up scene is seen by her father, who tries to commit suicide but fails, and is brought to the hospital, where he calls in Shikanosuke to talk. Her father cuts his wrist at the hospital, but Shikanosuke decides not to call the doctor and lets him die. After his death, the family debt is lifted, but Shikanosuke still feels guilty because of his decision. In the end, Kirari states that she wants to be in relationship with him and forgives him after he confesses his role in her father's death.

Out of hundreds of bands that submitted entries, only the top fifteen bands, selected by online polling, advanced to the next round. A panel of expert judges then chose six semi-finalists based on their musical potential. The semi-finalists were flown to Los Angeles, where they received guidance from a series of mentors and given the chance to play live for the judges. Three finalists had the opportunity make their own music video and, finally, competed in a battle of the bands on-stage. Semi-finalists The six semi-finalist bands, selected from the initial fifteen competitors by judges, were: * Low Luster League * Cuna De Lobos * Velorio * Spellbound Escape * Mystery Hangup * Zigmat Low Luster League, Cuna de Lobos and Velorio went on to become finalists, with Low Luster League ultimately winning the competition. Judges and mentors A total of eight mentors from the music industry, many of whom were associated with rock music, gave the semi-finalist bands support and advice.

The company soon became the leading British firm in the North American timber trade. British North American operations The Miramichi operations, established by Alexander Rankin, had originally been conceived by Allan Gilmour as a means of beating Napoleon's Continental System, which prohibited lumber exports to Britain from the Baltic countries. Robert Rankin, Alexander's brother, established another branch of the firm, Robert Rankin and Company, in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Saint John branch soon became the most successful operation in Pollok, Gilmour, and Company's empire. Pollok, Gilmour, and Company was a vast North Atlantic concern which by 1838 operated 130 vessels in the timber trade – making it the largest British shipowning firm at the time – and employed no fewer than 15,000 men in its sawmills, on its wharves, and in the forests; it owned as well 2,000 horses and oxen for draught purposes. In the early 1830s the firm shipped out annually over 300 cargoes of timber. Rankin, Gilmour and Company A dispute among the founding partners erupted in 1837, and in 1838 Robert Rankin returned to Glasgow to settle the dispute. Robert maintained the helm of the firm throughout his remaining years, renaming it as Rankin, Gilmour and Company, and moving the headquarters to Liverpool, England.biographi.ca: \\"RANKIN, ROBERT\\" In order to employ its large fleet fully in the winter months, branch houses were opened in New Orleans, and Mobile, Alabama, where the company entered the rapidly expanding cotton trade. The diversification into cotton brought great profits, and by 1851 Rankin was a member of the Dock Committee of Liverpool.

He has one sister, Farah Khan, who is a choreographer, director, producer and actor. Farah is married to Shirish Kunder, also a producer, editor and director of films. Khan has other connections to the film industry: former actresses Honey Irani and Daisy Irani are his mother's sisters and filmmakers Farhan Akhtar and Zoya Akhtar are his maternal cousins. Khan completed his primary education from Maneckji Cooper School in Mumbai and then graduated from Mithibai College. At age 16, while still a college student, he started DJing at various parties and social events.  Career  Khan began his career as a host of the TV show Main Bhi Detective in 1995. He then hosted a music countdown show Ikke Pe Ikka in 1996. The show entered the Limca Book of Records as the longest running countdown show to be aired on Indian television with the same host. In Kehne Mein Kya Harz Hai he played triple roles; the show made 200 episodes which were aired from 1997-2001. He also did a stand-up comedy show Sajid No. 1 in the late 1990s. His next show was Super SaIe in 2005. In 2008, he hosted a talk show, Sajid's Superstars and also judged India's Got Talent season 2. Along with Terrence Lewis and Shilpa Shetty, Khan was a judge on Nach Baliye Season 5 (2012–13) and Nach Baliye Season 6 (2013-14). Khan started his directorial career with the movie Darna Zaroori Hai (2006), which had six short stories, in which he directed one story – the story about a man going to watch a movie passing through a graveyard (starring Manoj Pahwa and Sarita Joshi) called The Graveyard. He then directed Heyy Babyy (2007), his first full-length effort. This was followed by Housefull (2010) and Housefull 2 (2012); all three were successful. This was followed by Himmatwala (2013), a critical and commercial failure. His next directorial venture was Humshakals (2014), which is generally ranked amongst the worst Indian films of all time by critics. Khan acted in the movie Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate (1998). He also made a brief appearance in Main Hoon Na (2004), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004) and Happy New Year (2014).

He was heavily criticised by actors such as Akshay Kumar and Bipasha Basu, after which he stepped down from the Directorship of Housefull 4.https://twitter.com/rose_k01/status/1275076253951770626?s=20 Khan was eventually replaced by Farhad Samji, the co-directer of Housefull 3. On 15 October 2018, The Indian Film and Television Directors’ Association issued a showcause notice to Khan. “Your...actions have brought disrepute to Indian Film and Television Directors’ Association,” read the notice. It further noted that they expected an explanation from Khan \\"for such offensive behaviour within seven days of the receipt of the notice for further action as per the rules and regulations… In case of no reply, ex-parte decision would be taken.” The one year ban by The Indian Film and Television Directors’ Association was revoked on December 10, 2019.

In the Arab world, the name Zeitoun District Massacre () is used to refer to any of the incidents in Zeitoun. A total of 48 residents of Zeitoun were killed, most of them women, children, and the elderly; 27 homes, a mosque and a number of farms were destroyed by Israeli forces. The New York Times, speaking of the three-week conflict in Gaza, wrote, \\"Israel’s attack has razed buildings and upended families in much of crowded Gaza. But few neighborhoods suffered more than Zeitoun, a district of eastern Gaza City.\\" A report released by United Nations Office for Humanitarian Affairs stated that the attack on the Samouni family, who were among the Zeitoun victims, was one of the \\"gravest incidents\\" in the conflict. According to Haaretz, the IDF delayed rescue services from reaching some of the casualties for three days of the incident.Amira Hass,IDF closes probe into Israeli air strike that killed 21 members of Gaza family at Haaretz, 1 May 2012. Zeitoun residents believed that because the area is a natural choke point where the Gaza strip narrows to just four miles wide, Israeli troops turned their neighborhoods into a military base from which to launch their operations. The IDF has refused to discuss individual charges in detail, but an army spokesman speaking on the condition of anonymity with The Los Angeles Times said, \\"As a matter of policy, we do not target civilians.\\" He added, \\"These situations are very complex and our soldiers do the best they can.\\" Lt. Col. (ret.) Jonathan D. Halevi of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, an Israeli think tank and advocacy organisation, said that printed flyers from Palestinian Islamic Jihad and its associated websites named five members of the Samouni extended family as being affiliated with the group in some role. Halevi also states that militants from that organisation were operating in the area around the time Israeli tanks began shelling the group of homes belonging to the Samouni extended family.Blocking the truth behind the Gaza war, JPost, September 22, 2009Blocking the Truth of the Gaza War, JCPA, September 18, 2009Goldstone: ‘If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.’, The Forward, October 16, 2009 According to the New York Times, members of the Samouni family \\"did not deny that Hamas militants operated in the area. A family member said there was no active Hamas resistance in the immediate vicinity, although militants were firing rockets at Israel a little more than a mile away.\\" Newsweek reported that the survivors of Zeitoun all insisted that they were simply farmers and that their area had never been used to fire rockets. The Samouni family According to accounts by family members, on January 4, 2009, the first day of the Israeli incursion in the Zeitoun district, the Samouni clan were ordered out of their houses (most of them were later demolished) by Israeli soldiers and told to gather in a nearby home. They were forced to move again to another building, with over 100 members in one home. On January 5, Israelis began demolishing the wall of the house. According to eyewitnesses, when one of the occupants went to alert the Israeli soldiers that people were inside, including women and children, the soldiers began to shoot at the house. After a short lull, the house was shelled and hit by missiles fired by the Israeli Air Force, severely damaging the building and killing and injuring the occupants. A total of 49 members of the Samouni extended family were killed, according to The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian newspapers, reporting from Zeitoun, while Newsweek divided the number killed into 29 family members and 19 others. Articles in Haaretz say just 21 family members were killed, and do not mention other deaths. A large number of the dead were women and children; the Telegraph reported that the dead were, \\"mostly women, children and elderly\\". Members of the Samouni family had been sheltering in one of the house, trying to avoid attracting the attention of Israeli soldiers who were in the area, who had previously gathered them into that particular house. On Monday morning, 5 January 2009, four men left the house to gather firewood for cooking. Next to the house was a small wooden structure, and the men had reportedly begun climbing on this to take the boards apart. This activity was seen in aerial drone photographs, and the poles that the men were carrying were mistakenly identified as rocket- propelled grenades by an Israeli Givati Brigade commander operating from a remote location. One soldier later testified to Breaking the Silence that soldiers had received information that a rocket-propelled grenade squad were located in the area. On seeing the drone photographs, the Israeli commander called for a missile strike against the men outside the house; they ran into the Samouni house for shelter, which was then struck twice with subsequent missile fire.Amira Hass,IDF closes probe into Israeli air strike that killed 21 members of Gaza family. Haaretz, 1 May 2012.Amira Hass,What led to IDF bombing house full of civilians during Gaza War?, at Haaretz 24 October 2010. Another attack on family members was reported to have occurred in the house across the street on January 4. According to one of the local residents, Israeli soldiers came to her house where she and 18 other family members were sheltering from the fighting outside, and deliberately shot at her family members. According to a report from Newsweek, published online in The Daily Beast, Zahwa Samouni, and her son Faraj, said that prior to the alleged shooting, her husband presented his ID to the IDF and identified himself as the owner of the house. After he told them that he has children and pleaded for them to hold their fire, they shot him repeatedly, about 20-30 times, \\"I don't know how many\\" according to witnesses. He along with his four-year-old son were killed. In another incident, a witness reported that after forcing 45 members of the Samouni family into one room, the IDF blindfolded and cuffed eight male members of the family and subsequently interrogated them. The family were then ordered outside, and three of the men were ordered by soldiers to \\"walk to Gaza City\\" and to not \\"come back\\". During the pleas of the men's wives, a soldier shot one of the men as they were leaving. According to a report from Newsweek, published online in The Daily Beast, one killed Samouni member was found on the street on January 4. His hands were cuffed, but the circumstances of his death are not clear as there were no eyewitness accounts reported as of January 19, 2009. A representative from the Israeli thinktank and advocacy organisation, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Lt. Colonel (res.) Jonathan Halevi, said that an examination of freely accessible Palestinian sources show that five members of the Samouni family were affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad group; Tawfiq al-Samouni, who was killed on January 5, was a Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative, according to Halevi. He suggests that the official Palestinian Islamic Jihad version of the occurrences on the days of the incident indicate that its fighters had been operating in the area against IDF. Based on the evidences, he suggests that it is plausible civilians were caught in the fighting.Goldstone: ‘If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.’, The Forward, October 16, 2009 According to Israeli soldiers who took part in operations in the Zeitoun district, and who spoke with Haaretz and Breaking the Silence, brigade commander Col. Ilan Malka insisted that not a single ambulance should enter the sector under his responsibility, fearing Hamas attempts to capture Israeli soldiers. A soldier said that Col. Malka insisted the wounded should be taken on foot for medical care, to meet ambulances at a distance of over three kilometers away. The ambulances were kept at a distance, according to the Red Cross, by an earth mound put in the road into the area by the Israeli military. But many reports from the field stated that some groups of civilians who did try to walk to the ambulances were turned back, with soldiers firing at them. Israel said that it cooperated with medics during the war although battlefield conditions sometimes made permitting access impossible. It said it would address this incident after it concluded its investigations. The IDF said it did not target civilians and in challenging situations in which fighting occurred within residential areas, civilian casualties were unfortunately possible. Local witnesses said that most of the family members who died had been killed instantly, while others sustained wounds and were unable to receive help in time, due to the IDF's alleged refusal to allow paramedics access to the wounded. One Palestinian doctor said that over 100 phone calls were made by residents seeking help for the injured. While two medics were sent, they were reportedly blocked by the Israelis. Israel said that it cooperated with medics but it was sometimes impossible to permit access because of the battlefield conditions. Among those wounded in the Monday attack was 12-year-old Ishaq Samouni, who bled for two days before he died on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Israelis ordered a three-hour pause in hostilities to allow entry of rescue workers and humanitarian aid. Paramedics found four exhausted children beside their mothers' corpses; the children were in the open for 48 hours with Israeli soldiers nearby. The head of Red Cross operations in the Gaza Strip said the first rescue team could only take out only the wounded, and had to leave the dead, because they only had 4 ambulances and they had limited time. Israel restricted the entry of the ambulances and medics had to walk and then carry the injured in a donkey cart back to the ambulances a mile away. On the following Thursday, the Red Cross stated that the Israelis did not fulfil its role in the care and vacating of the wounded as required by international law. The rest of the corpses were collected two weeks later, a day after the IDF disengaged. The IDF denied that they were targeting civilians. The New York Times reported that Hamas members launched rockets at Israel about a mile away from the residents, and that Zeitoun \\"is known to have many supporters of Hamas.\\" The IDF stated that their purpose was to besiege areas from where Hamas launched rockets, and that Zeitoun was one of these areas. Disputing this claim, Zeitoun residents claimed that Hamas did not have much support in their area and that the residents are mostly supporters of Fatah. In a statement from the IDF, an Israeli official said they are investigating the attacks but did not deny the attacks were intentional. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Navanethem Pillay, along with other international aid officials advocated an investigation in Zeitoun for possible war crimes. =Racist graffiti= Two of the houses belonging to the Samouni clan were the only buildings that were not completely demolished. Slogans were found inside written in Hebrew and English, including \\"Death to Arabs\\"; \\"The Only Good Arab is a Dead Arab\\", and \\"Arabs are pieces of shit\\". One slogan \\"1 is down, 999,999 to go\\" evidently referred to Gaza's Palestinian population of around one million people. Another depicted a gravestone marked with the legend, \\"Arabs 1948-2009\\". An officer from a unit in the area stated, \\"Sometimes soldiers don't differentiate between Hamas and Arabs.\\" The IDF spokesperson said that the graffiti is \\"against any code of behavior of the IDF or moral values\\" and if the graffiti could be substantiated \\"soldiers will be punished.\\" The Helw and ad-Daya families According to the testimonies from the family members collected by LA Times correspondent, Israeli soldiers stormed the home of the Helw family, shooting 55-year-old Fuad Helw in front of his family and then instructing the rest of the family, 13 members, to leave the home. The family was assured by soldiers that they would not be targeted, however, as they were walking, they came under Israeli gunfire. Three family members were injured and a one-year-old was killed. According to an account from Gaza residents delivered to B'Tselem, an air strike collapsed the home of Ad-Daya family, killing thirteen family members.

It forms Mammoth Pool Reservoir and lies within the Sierra National Forest. The dam and reservoir were named after a large natural pool in the river that was once located above the present dam site. History In 1900, engineer John S. Eastwood and several wealthy investors founded the Mammoth Power Company with the goal of harnessing hydroelectric power from the upper San Joaquin River. The Mammoth Pool site, where the San Joaquin River canyon chokes down to a narrow gap between massive walls of solid granite, was immediately seen as an attractive dam site. The company's first proposal was to construct a rockfill diversion dam that would send water into a -long tunnel, developing a hydraulic head of over to supply a 120,000 hp powerhouse. However, the investors involved with Mammoth eventually lost interest due to the enormous scope of the project. By 1901, the Mammoth Pool proposal was shelved. During the mid-1950s, development of hydroelectric facilities in the upper San Joaquin basin began to pick up again and plans were finalized for the construction of Mammoth Pool and its associated power station. Construction of the main dam embankment started in October 1958 after the San Joaquin River was diverted through a -long tunnel to bypass the dam site. Work progressed fairly quickly, although the builders ran into problems with exfoliation of granite sheets, probably caused by drilling and explosive charges along the steep walls of the gorge. The dam was topped out almost exactly one year later in late 1959. Purpose The dam serves mainly for the generation of hydroelectric power. It is an important component of Southern California Edison's Big Creek Hydroelectric Project, which comprises a system of 25 dams, nine power plants and supporting tunnels and diversion channels in the upper basin of the San Joaquin River. Water from the reservoir is diverted into a -long reinforced concrete penstock into Mammoth Pool Powerhouse, which has two 100,000 hp turbines totaling a nominal generating capacity of 190 megawatts (MW). Due to friction decreasing flow rate in the power tunnel, the actual output during maximum generation is only about 187 MW. A high surge chamber is located shortly above the powerhouse to provide protection to the turbines in case of abrupt flow fluctuations through the tunnel. The hydraulic head afforded to the power plant is almost three times greater than the dam's structural height. Dimensions Mammoth Pool is a rockfill structure standing above the foundations and long. The dam rises for above the bed of the San Joaquin River, and contains about of material. The crest is situated at an elevation of and is approximately wide. The dam's base, by contrast, is more than thick. The reservoir formed behind the dam has a conservation storage of , a maximum capacity of , and can reach elevations of above sea level. Normal water releases from the dam are controlled by a cone (Howell- Bunger) valve with a capacity of at maximum pool. Any higher water will flow over an uncontrolled ogee crest spillway cut into the rock of the San Joaquin Canyon about a quarter of a mile to the west of the main dam. The spillway is wide and has a capacity of approximately . Environmental impacts Mammoth Pool Dam has caused the submersion of a migratory route commonly used by mule deer in the Sierra, forcing them to swim across the reservoir during their spring and autumn migrations. The reservoir is closed to all public use between May 15 to June 15 to prevent disturbance of the deer population. During late summer and autumns of most years, nearly the entire flow of the San Joaquin River is diverted into the Mammoth Pool penstock, essentially drying up nearly of riverbed. This has resulted in severe declines in fish populations in the stretch between Mammoth Pool and Dam No. 6, where the outflow from the Mammoth Pool powerhouse is located.

Biography Bar-Hillel is the daughter of Maya Bar-Hillel, a professor of psychology at the Hebrew University, and the granddaughter of philosopher and linguist Yehoshua Bar-Hillel. Her mother frequently lectured in the United States and as a result she spent a lot of time there as a child, learning to read English before Hebrew.

She lives and works in Tel Aviv,The Child and the Book 2007 , Boğaziçi University and is married with three children.

Because of the enormous popularity of Harry Potter, her work has come under close scrutiny by the Israeli public, especially for any deviations from the original text. The translation process was made more difficult by not knowing how the plot would develop in later books, the gender of certain characters, and the problem of how to translate various issues that are not necessarily cross-cultural, such as references to food and religion. When the seventh book was released, Bar-Hillel flew to London ahead of the book's launch, purchased a copy and read it on the plane back to Israel.Harry Potter is here, Yedioth Ahronoth, Reuven Weiss, July 9, 2007The Magic Continues, Jerusalem Post, Molly Nixon, July 19, 2007 At the Jerusalem International Book Fair in 2007, a large audience gathered to hear her talk about the translation process, with fans elbowing their way in for autographs and photos.

It succeeded to the municipal chairs of experimental physics, applied chemistry and mechanics that were established in 1817. Its heir as a graduate engineering school is École Centrale de Lille.  History  École impériale des arts industriels et des mines Historical building from 1854 to 1875 École des arts industriels et des mines de Lille was founded in 1854, the same year when Louis Pasteur became the dean of Faculté des sciences de Lille and pioneered applied research with industry cooperations, with support of scientists such as Frédéric Kuhlmann. Between 1854 and 1871, students attending the two-year/three-year curriculum grew to 90 per annum. Baccalaureate was a prerequisite to admission to the engineering school. The school delivered engineering degrees. The curriculum during the first two years of engineering education included manufacturing and textile industry, engine design, chemistry and metallurgy, mines, as required by entrepreneurs in Northern France. The third year of the curriculum provided optional lectures in engines, mine exploitation, mechanical engineering and chemical engineering.

Upon her arrival in America, she labored successfully for the passage of an act of Congress requiring that sanitary provision should be made on emigrant vessels. On her return to England she procured the passage of a similar act of England's Parliament. Upon her return, the London Times wrote of her: > We can easily account for Mrs. Maury's enthusiasm for America. Such a man as > her father-in-law, the late James Maury, the friend and play-fellow of > Thomas Jefferson, was one whose merits could never fail to be appreciated by > any; he maintained the honour and interests of his country in England for > fifty years. Some of Mr. Maury's earliest impressions of America must have > been derived from her communications with that excellent man, and the > inheritors of his name, and not less of his amiable qualities, and these, > together with the pleasure he must have had in her friendly communications > with the many agreeable and intelligent American families residing in > Liverpool, would naturally give her a more favourable impression of the > people of that country.

Add to this, that America is full of > objects calculated to excite the admiration and respect of every intelligent > traveler, and we cannot wonder that Mrs. Maury has come back more American > than the Americans themselves. She wrote Etchings from the Caracci (Liverpool, 1842); An Englishwoman in America (1846); The Statesmen of America in 1846 (Philadelphia, 1847); and Progress of the Catholic Church in America (1847). She died of typhus fever contracted from an infected well and was buried in the city cemetery of Fredericksburg, Virginia beside her husband.

(2005). \\"Sakata Shōichi\\" in ; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, see Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File . He proposed the two meson theory, the Sakata model (an early precursor to the quark model), and the Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata neutrino mixing matrix. After the end of World War II, he joined other physicists in campaigning for the peaceful uses of nuclear power. Career Sakata got in to the Kyoto Imperial University in 1930. When he was a second year student, Yoshio Nishina, a granduncle-in-law of Sakata, gave a lecture on quantum mechanics at the Kyoto Imperial University. Sakata became acquainted with Hideki Yukawa and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, the first and the second Japanese Nobel laureates, through the lecture. After the graduation from the University, Sakata worked with Tomonaga and Nishina at Rikagaku Kenkyusho (RIKEN) in 1933 and moved to Osaka Imperial University in 1934 to work with Yukawa. Yukawa published his first paper on the meson theory in 1935 and Sakata closely collaborated with him for the developments of the meson theory. Possible existence of the neutral nuclear force carrier particle was postulated by them. Accompanied by Yukawa, Sakata moved to Kyoto Imperial University as a lecturer in 1939. Sakata and Inoue proposed their two-meson theory in 1942. At the time, a charged particle discovered in the hard component cosmic rays was misidentified as the Yukawa’s meson (, nuclear force career particle). The misinterpretation led to puzzles in the discovered cosmic ray particle. Sakata and Inoue solved these puzzles by identifying the cosmic ray particle as a daughter charged fermion produced in the decay. A new neutral fermion was also introduced to allow decay into fermions. We now know that these charged and neutral fermions correspond to the second generation leptons μ and in the modern language. They then discussed the decay of the Yukawa particle, :{   →   + } Sakata and Inoue predicted correct spin assignment for the muon, and they also introduced the second neutrino. They treated it as a distinct particle from the beta decay neutrino, and anticipated correctly the three body decay of the muon. The English printing of Sakata-Inoue’s two-meson theory paper was delayed until 1946, one year before the experimental discovery of π → μν decay. Sakata moved to Nagoya Imperial University as a professor in October 1942 and remained there until his death. The name of the university was changed to Nagoya University in October 1947 after the end of the Pacific War (1945). Sakata reorganized his research group in Nagoya to be administrated under the democracy principle after the War. Sakata stayed at the Niels Bohr Institute from May to October 1954 at the invitation of N. Bohr and C. Møller. During his stay, Sakata gave a talk introducing works of young Japanese particle physics researchers, especially emphasizing an empirical relation found by Nakano and Nishijima, which is now known as the Nakano-Nishijima-Gell-Mann (NNG) rule among the strongly interacting particles (hadrons). After Sakata returned to Nagoya, Sakata and his Nagoya group started researches trying to uncover the physics behind the NNG rule. Sakata then proposed his Sakata Model in 1956, which explains the NNG rule by postulating the fundamental building blocks of all strongly interacting particles are the proton, the neutron and the lambda baryon. The positively charged pion is made out of a proton and an antineutron, in a manner similar to the Fermi-Yang composite Yukawa meson model, while the positively charged kaon is composed of a proton and an anti- lambda, succeeding to explain the NNG rule in the Sakata model. Aside from the integer charges, the proton, neutron, and lambda have similar properties as the up quark, down quark, and strange quark respectively. In 1959, Ikeda, Ogawa and Ohnuki and, independently, Yamaguchi found out the U(3) symmetry in the Sakata model. The U(3) symmetry provides a mathematical descriptions of hadrons in the eightfold way idea (1961) of Murray Gell-Mann. Sakata's model was superseded by the quark model, proposed by Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964, which keeps the U(3) symmetry, but made the constituents fractionally charged and rejected the idea that they could be identified with observed particles. Still, within Japan, integer charged quark models parallel to Sakata's were used until the 1970s, and are still used as effective descriptions in certain domains. Sakata's model was used in Harry J. Lipkin's book \\"Lie Groups for Pedestrians\\" (1965). The Sakata model and its SU(3) symmetry were also explained in the textbook \\"Weak Interaction of Elementary Particles\\", L.B.Okun (1965). In 1959, Gamba, Marshak and Okubo found Sakata’s baryon triplet (proton, neutron and lambda baryon) bears striking similarity to the lepton triplet (neutrino, electron and muon) in the weak interaction aspects. In order to explain the physics behind this similarity in the composite model framework, in 1960, Sakata expanded his composite model to include leptons with his Nagoya University associates Maki, Nakagawa, and Ohnuki. The expanded model was termed “Nagoya Model”. Shortly thereafter the existence of two kinds of neutrinos was experimentally confirmed. In 1962, Maki, Nakagawa and Sakata, and also Katayama, Matumoto, Tanaka and Yamada accommodated the two distinct types of neutrino into the composite model framework. In his 1962 paper with Maki and Nakagawa, they used the Gell-Mann- Levy proposal of modified universality to define the weak mixing angle that later became known as Cabibbo angle; and extended it to the leptons, clearly distinguishing neutrino weak and mass eigenstates, thus defining the neutrino flavor mixing angle as well as predicting neutrino flavor oscillations. The neutrino flavor mixing matrix is now named Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix. The nontrivial neutrino mixing as introduced in the Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata paper is now experimentally confirmed through the neutrino oscillation experiments. Influences The U(3) symmetry found first in the Sakata model gave a guiding principle to construct the quark model of Gell-Mann and Zweig. The two-meson theory of Sakata and Inoue became well-recognized in the world around 1950. The 2008 physics Nobel laureates Yoichiro Nambu, Toshihide Maskawa and Makoto Kobayashi, who received their awards for work on symmetry breaking, all came under his tutelage and influence.Asia News & Thailand News The baryonic mixing in the weak current in the Nagoya Model was the inspiration for the later Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix of 1973, which specifies the mismatch of quantum states of quarks, when they propagate freely and when they take part in weak interactions. Physicists however, generally attribute the introduction of a third generation of quarks (the \\"top\\" and \\"bottom\\" quarks) into the Standard Model of the elementary particles to that 1973 paper by Kobayashi and Maskawa. The neutrino oscillation phenomena, as predicted by Maki, Nakagawa and Sakata, has been experimentally confirmed (2015 Nobel prize in physics). Kent Staley (2004) describes the historical background to their paper, emphasizing the largely forgotten role of theorists at Nagoya University and the \\"Nagoya model\\" they developed. Several of the authors of the Nagoya model embraced the philosophy of dialectical materialism, and he discusses the role that such metaphysical commitments play in physical theorizing. Both theoretical and experimental developments that generated great interest in Japan, and ultimately stimulated Kobayashi and Maskawa's 1973 work, went almost entirely unnoticed in the U.S. The episode exemplifies both the importance of untestable \\"themata\\" in developing new theories, and the difficulties that may arise, when two parts of a research community work in relative isolation from one another.Kent W. Staley; Lost Origins of the Third Generation of Quarks: Theory, Philosophy: Pages 210-229 in Physics in Perspective (PIP), Birkhäuser, Basel (2004). ISSN 1422-6944 Missed out on Nobel Prize Shoichi Sakata's \\"Sakata model\\" inspired Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig's quark model, but the 1969 prize was only awarded to Murray Gell-Mann. Afterward, Ivar Waller, the member of Nobel Committee for Physics was sorry that Sakata had not received a prize.Robert Marc Friedman, The Politics of Excellence: Behind the Nobel Prize in Science. New York: Henry Holt & Company (October 2001) In September 1970, Hideki Yukawa politely wrote to Waller informing him that Sakata had been ill when the nomination was written; since then, his condition had worsened significantly. Three weeks later, Sakata died. Yukawa informed Waller that a prize to Sakata would have brought him much honor and encouragement. He, then, in the name of leading Japanese particle physicists, asked to know what the Nobel committee thought of Sakata's merits, for that would perhaps bring them consolation.

Royal letters The book was well received by both the Queen and especially the Queen Mother, who both wrote letters expressing their pleasure at receiving copies. The Queen mother's letter showed she had read it and enjoyed it greatly. The start The idea for the book came in 1966, when Marion Halpenny was at a race meeting and heard one woman asking another why a certain horse was wearing a nose band, it occurred to her at the time that the majority of people going to meetings knew very little about the details of racing and she thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to put all the information together in a book. So began the task of collecting the necessary information, sifting through it, selecting items and preparing them for the book. She did all this without knowing it would ever be published and was pleasantly surprised when the first publisher she sent the manuscript to accepted it straight away. Though met favourably by the media, who liked the lone woman against the establishment angle, male chauvinists in the racing world were lukewarm and a series of copy cat books, written by men, were quickly published afterwards. The diagrams of the tracks of the racecourses, which were an innovation of Marion Halpenny, were also quickly copied by newspapers and other publications and are still often used and seen in publications today. All came from the book British Racing and Racecourses.
