It is a biopic of Czar Paul I of Russia and the final film of the historical trilogy of Vitaly Melnikov \\"The Empire. The Beginning\\". Plot ...The cold November of 1796. Empress Catherine the Great who undividedly ruled Russia for 34 years has died. The throne goes back to her son Paul I - a nervous and impetuous middle aged man, who is a captive of his own illusions. Deciding to change almost everything what he inherited from his unloved mother, Paul attracts supporters, one of whom is Count Peter Pahlen. He is an intelligent and calculating courtier who thanks to the boundless trust of the emperor gathers immense power in his hands. Pahlen initially supports Paul's reforms but then the situation changes... The highest nobility in Russia, fueled by the money of England is extremely unhappy with the innovations of Paul I. One after another plots against him are conspired. Distraught by the suspicion directed towards him and fearing for his life, Paul punishes the innocent and the guilty, but this can not save the unfortunate emperor. The main conspiracy against Paul involves his own sons, Alexander and Constantine, and its general command is carried out by Count Pahlen! Paul eventually falls in total despair after he learns of such a comprehensive betrayal, he ceases to resist and the doomed man awaits the conspirators-murderers in his bedroom at the Mikhailovsky Castle ...

The event placed machine versus machine (no human intervention) in what was called the \\"world's first automated network defense tournament.\\" The final event was held on August 4, 2016 at the Paris Hotel & Conference Center in Las Vegas, Nevada within the 24th DEF CON hacker convention. It resembled in structure the long-standing \\"capture the flag\\" (CTF) security competitions, and the winning system indeed competed against humans in the \\"classic\\" DEF CON CTF held in the following days. The Cyber Grand Challenge featured, however, a more standardized scoring and vulnerability-proving system: all exploits and patched binaries were submitted and evaluated by the referee infrastructure  as opposed to classic CTF games, in which players directly attack each others and freely change their own VMs Background Races develop between criminals attempting to abuse vulnerabilities and analysts who assess, remediate, check, and deploy a patch before significant damage can be done. Experts adhere to a process that involves complicated reasoning followed by manual creation of each security signature and software patch, a technical process that requires months and dollars. This has resulted in various software insecurities favoring attackers. Devices such as smart televisions, wearable technologies, and high-end home appliances that are connected to the internet aren't always produced with security in mind and moreover utility systems, power grids, and traffic lights could be more susceptible to attacks, says the DARPA. To help overcome these challenges, DARPA launched in 2014 the Cyber Grand Challenge: a two-year competition seeking to create automatic defensive systems capable of reasoning about flaws, formulating patches and deploying them on a network in real time. The competition was split into two main events: an open qualification event to be held in 2015 and a final event in 2016 where only the top seven teams from the qualifiers could participate. The winner of the final event would be awarded $2 million and the opportunity to play against humans in the 24th DEF CON capture the flag competition.  Technology  = Challenge binaries = Challenge Binaries ran on the full 32-bit Intel x86 architecture, albeit with a simplified ABI. Reducing external interaction to its base components (e.g., system calls for well-defined I/O, dynamic memory allocation, and a single source of randomness) simplified both modeling and securely running the binaries in isolation to observe their behavior. Internal complexity was however unrestricted, with challenges going as far as implementing a particle physics simulator, chess, programming/scripting languages, parsing of huge amounts of markup data, vector graphics, just-in-time compilation, VMs, etc. The challenge authors were themselves scored based on how well they distinguished the players' relative performance, encouraging challenges to exercise specific weaknesses of automatic reasoning (e.g., state explosion) while remaining solvable by well-constructed systems. = Player systems = Each playing system -- a fully-automated \\"Cyber Reasoning System\\" (CRS) -- had to demonstrate ability in several areas of computer security: * Automatic vulnerability finding on previously-unknown binaries. * Automatic patching of binaries without sacrificing performance. * Automatic exploit generation within the framework's limitations. * Implementing a security strategy: balancing resource-assignment among the available servers (a variation of the multi-armed bandit problem), responding to competitors (e.g., analyzing their patches, reacting to exploitation), evaluating own action's effect on the final score, ... Teams described their approach in various venues.Dedicated special issue of the IEEE Security & Privacy journal: Publications on individual components, such as Shellphish's Additionally, the third-place finisher (Shellphish) released their entire system's source code.https://github.com/mechaphish Due to the complexity of the task, players had to combine multiple techniques and do so in a fully-unattended and time-efficient fashion. For instance, the highest attack score was reached by discovering vulnerabilities via a combination of guided fuzzing and symbolic execution -- i.e., an AFL-based fuzzer combined with the angr binary analysis framework, leveraging a QEMU-based emulation and execution-tracing system.  CGC Qualification Event (CQE)  The CGC Qualification Event (CQE) was held on June 3, 2015 and lasted for 24 hours. CQE had two tracks: a funded-track for seven teams selected by DARPA based on their proposals (with an award up to $750,000 per team) and an open-track where any self-funded team could participate. Over 100 teams registered internationally and 28 reached the Qualification Event. During the event, teams were given 131 different programs and were challenged with finding vulnerabilities as well as fixing them automatically while maintaining performance and functionality. Collectively, all teams managed to identify vulnerabilities in 99 out of the 131 provided programs. After collecting all submissions from competitors, DARPA ranked all teams based on their patching and vulnerability-finding ability. The top seven teams and finalists in alphabetical order were: * CodeJitsu, a team of researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, Cyberhaven, and Syracuse (funded track). * CSDS, a team of researchers from the University of Idaho (open track). * Deep Red, a team of specialized engineers from Raytheon (open track). * disekt, a computer security team that participates in various Capture the Flag security competitions hosted by other teams, universities and organizations (open track). * ForAllSecure, a security startup composed of researchers and security experts (funded track). * Shellphish, a hacking team from the University of California, Santa Barbara (open track). * TECHx, a team of software analysis experts from GrammaTech, Inc. and the University of Virginia (funded track). Upon qualification, each one of the above seven teams received $750,000 in funding to prepare for the final event. CGC Final Event (CFE) The CGC Final Event (CFE) was held on August 4, 2016 and lasted for 11 hours. During the final event, finalists saw their machines face against each other in a fully automatic capture-the-flag competition. Each of the seven qualifying teams competed for the top three positions that would share almost $4 million in prize money. =Final Results= The winning systems of the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) Final Event were: # \\"Mayhem\\"  developed by ForAllSecure, of Pittsburgh, Pa. - $2 million # \\"Xandra\\" - developed by TECHx, GrammaTech Inc., Ithaca, N.Y., and Charlottesville, Va. - $1 million # \\"Mechanical Phish\\" - developed by Shellphish, UC Santa Barbara, Ca. - $750,000 The other competing systems were: * Rubeus  developed by Michael Stevenson, Raytheon, Deep Red of Arlington, Va. * Galactica - developed by CodeJitsu of Berkeley, Ca., Syracuse, N.Y., and Lausanne, Switzerland * Jima - developed by CSDS of Moscow, Id. * Crspy - system developed by disekt of Athens, Ga.

Biography =Early life= Leander Herron was born on December 29, 1846 in Fallsington, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Dr. George and Mary (Merrick) Herron.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6404324 His father was a medical doctor in Philadelphia and practiced medicine before moving to Bucks County, Pennsylvania where he continued practicing his profession. Herron was only two years old when his mother died and he was placed in the care of his aunt. He attended the public schools of Fallsington until he moved to Hannahville, Canal Township, in Vanango County, Pennsylvania. From 1858 to 1862 Leander worked on a packet boat on the canal between Erie and Pittsburgh. =Civil War service= When Fort Sumter was attacked at the beginning of the American Civil War, Herron wanted to join the Union Army, but was rejected because he was only 14 at the time.http://thetombstonenews.com/leander-herron-nebraskas-first-medal-of- honor-recipient-p992-84.htm On December 10, 1863, shortly before his 17th birthday, Herron enlisted in Company C, 83rd Pennsylvania Infantry in New Brighton, Pennsylvania. When he enlisted, he was 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighed slightly more than 100 pounds. He served with the 83rd Pennsylvania in the Siege of Petersburg and at Appomattox Court House. He was mustered out with his regiment on June 28, 1865.https://npsfrsp.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/medal-of-honor-recipient-caught- straggling-on-the-march/ After the war he enlisted in Company A of the 3rd Infantry and was stationed at Fort Larned in Kansas. =Medal of Honor action= Herron left Fort Larned on the evening of September 1, 1868 to deliver mail to Fort Dodge - about 75 miles away. En route, he passed a labor detail of four soldiers from Fort Dodge gathering wood for use at the fort. The following day, Leander was supposed to make the return trip. Corporal Patrick Boyle of the 7th Cavalry accompanied Herron. After traveling about 12 miles, they heard gunfire. The labor detail Herron encountered the night before was being attacked by Indians. With pistols drawn, Herron and Boyle rode directly through the attackers and reached the imperiled soldiers. Herron took charge and the six men fought from behind a wagon confronting about fifty Indians. Herron decided to send Boyle to Fort Dodge for re-enforcements. The five remaining soldiers fought off repeated assaults through the night. As the night passed, the supply of ammunition diminished and all the soldiers, other than Herron, were wounded. Finally, Boyle and the reinforcements from Fort Dodge arrived. The attackers fled and the labor detail was saved.https://npsfrsp.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/medal-of-honor-recipient- caught-straggling-on-the-march/ He did not receive the Medal of Honor until 1919 ‚Äì 51 years after his heroic actions. He was the first Nebraskan to receive the Medal of Honor. =Later life= After being discharged from the Army in 1870, Herron settled in St. Paul, Nebraska. In 1897 he claimed to be in a series of famous photographs taken on May 21, 1864 of General Ulysses S. Grant and his staff at Massaponax Church in Hanover County, Virginia.https://npsfrsp.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/medal-of-honor-recipient- caught-straggling-on-the-march/ On 11 November 1921, Herron served as one of the official mourners at the burial of the Unknown Soldier of World War I in Arlington National Cemetery. In the 1930s Herron made a recorded interview with Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, who was also a Medal of Honor recipient, for the Chevrolet Chronicles radio show. In the recording Herron recounts the actions for which he received the Medal of Honor. The recording is now available at the Fort Larned National Historic Site website. Herron was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Legion of Valor.

Plot Opening quote: \\"Death stood behind him, and said: 'Follow me, the hour of your departure from this world has come.'\\" A Wesen park ranger, Ryan Gilko (Kevin Shinick), is attacked by an infected man and manages to escape from him. Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) are sent to retrieve the infected man and when he attacks them, they kill him. Renard (Sasha Roiz) is informed that his family sent a Wesen called the Nuckelavee to get Nick's key. Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) is regaining her memories back but she still can't remember Nick or anything about him. Meanwhile, Gilko is beginning to get infected by the same disease. After Adalind's cat escapes, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) invites Rosalee (Bree Turner) to a picnic, which she accepts. Gilko encounters them and chases after them but they manage to leave. They later kiss. Nick sees the disease \\"Yellow plague\\" is spreading and asks Rosalee to find an antidote. Monroe discovers Rosalee is infected too. Gilko collapses and Nick and Hank take him to the shop where Monroe is forced to do the antidote for him but Rosalee escapes. She attacks Nick and he is forced to knock her unconscious so they can give her the cure and save her. The episode ends as the Nuckelavee watches over them. Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 4.62 million people, earning a 1.5/4 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking first on its timeslot and fifth for the night in the 18-49 demographics behind a rerun of 2 Broke Girls, two episodes of Hotel Hell, and a rerun of The Big Bang Theory. This was a 2% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 4.67 million viewers with a 1.6/4. This means that 1.5 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 4 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. =Critical reviews= \\"Quill\\" received positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"If last week's episode ‚Äî with a case centered around child kidnapping, inbreeding and ritualistic rape ‚Äî was what Grimm: SVU would look like, now we know what this show would look like when filtered through a minor zombie plague outbreak. 'Quill' isn't Grimms version of 28 Days Later or Dawn of the Dead or anything apocalyptic, it‚Äôs a standard plague, spreading through a small population, eventually infecting one of the major characters, before a quick remedy comes through right before the episode ends. Nothing particularly special on the plot front, but that's not as important as the character progress, which is moving along nicely to build a stronger character base so that riskier episodic plots will have a better chance for success.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"If there's one thing Grimm does well, it's making unlikable characters actually likable (remember my disdain for Juliette?), and 'Quill' accomplishes just that with Hank. Congratulations on joining the pack. Hank! You're official off the 'I don't care about you' list!\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"Grimm has done a fine job of filling out the Wesen world. Be it through the introduction of different types of creatures, a look at the ways they go about their intra- species hierarchy. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the show is quite fantastical and appropriately supernatural; it's just that, nearly 30 episodes into its run, Grimm has managed to underline its theme (human duality) fairly well while making the Wesen world feel like, well, a world.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"Thematically Grimm continues to upend the pieces on the board. Just like Hank and Juliette, we're all frantically evaluating and re-evaluating with every new piece of information we have. We also have to ask ourselves what good and bad means to the various agendas and plots flying around. In Season 1 it would have been a good thing for Juliette to find out about Nick being a Grimm. Now that she has no memory of him, this feels like it'll lead to disaster.\\" References External links Grimm (season 2) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"Quill (Grimm)"},{"id":"51100326","text":"Jacob Wayne Fredericks (1917-2004) was an American businessman and diplomat who served as the United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs from 1961 until 1967.

The company had 350 workers and three locomotives to transport the cane over 12 miles of narrow gauge track.  Locomotives  The first locomotive was imported from John Fowler & Co. at Leeds, England. It had to be disassembled and re-assembled to get it ashore. Only then it was noted that it did not match the narrow gauge track. The undercarriage had to be dismantled, machined to size, and then commissioned.

A Jesuit since 1919, he served as President of the College of the Holy Cross from 1939 to 1945, and President of Boston College from 1951 to 1958.  Early life and education  Maxwell was born in Taunton, Massachusetts, United States, on 7 November 1899, to Richard Everett Maxwell and Caroline A. Carpenter. He attended Taunton public schools, including Taunton High School, before entering the College of the Holy Cross in 1918. After a year he entered the Society of Jesus on 8 September 1919, taking the religious name Nonnatus. After graduating in 1921, he studied the classics at St. Andrew-on-Hudson Novitiate for two years. He then went to Boston College, graduating in 1926 with a Master of Arts, and from 1926 to 1929 held a teaching position at the College of the Holy Cross. He then attended Fordham University, where he earned his Doctor of Philosophy in 1930. He went on to study philosophy at Weston College, graduating in 1933 with a Licentiate of Sacred Theology.  Priesthood and academic career  Maxwell was ordained to the priesthood in 1932. In 1935, he was appointed Dean at Boston College, where he served until 1939. On 12 September 1939, he was appointed President of the College of the Holy Cross by Rev. James S. Dolan, SJ, the Provincial of the New England Province of the Society of Jesus. At 39, he was the youngest person appointed to the position at the time. His presidency took place during the difficult years during World War II, when the number of students decreased due to military conscription, and his leadership style has been described as conservative. In 1939, Wheeler Hall was dedicated, despite decreasing enrollment, which dropped by 70 in his first academic year as president. In addition to this issue, Maxwell also worked to revamp Holy Cross academically. In November 1938, the Association of American Universities sent evaluators to the college and later prepared a report as part of the accreditation process. While accreditation was unhesitatingly granted, Maxwell described the report as \\"far from flattering.\\" Not a single Jesuit faculty member held a PhD, and the report described the general credentials of the faculty as subpar for \\"an institution of the standing of Holy Cross.\\" The accreditors recommended that faculty members pursue further studies \\"in leading graduate and professional institutions, including at least some not connected with the Catholic Church.\\" Maxwell was proactive upon hearing this, and less than a month after taking office, he was preparing for the implementation of the recommendations. He also took a more active role than his predecessors in managing the Holy Cross athletic program, despite an apparent lack of interest in athletics. He made clear his athletic policies in the fall of 1941, when he limited the number and size of athletic scholarships, and asserted that the college needed \\"to keep our standards where they belong,\\" even at the risk of less successful sports teams. In 1945, he left the presidency of Holy Cross and became Rector of Cranwell Preparatory School in Lenox, Massachusetts. Six years later, in 1951, Maxwell was appointed President of Boston College. As president, he struggled with a drop in enrollment caused by the Korean War, but also made improvements to the school's administration, including the development of faculty norms for promotion. In addition, the university's intellectual and cultural esteem increased as a result of bringing in respected lecturers and professors, including many from outside traditional Catholic circles. Some of those invited to lecture during Maxwell's presidency included Adlai Stevenson II, G. Mennen Williams, Frank Sheed, Robert Frost. During his presidency, Maxwell had a friendly relationship with Rev. Robert Drinan, SJ, who was at that time on the faculty of Boston College Law School. In 1955, Maxwell was invited to the White House, where he met President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower. Notably, it was during Maxwell's presidency that Boston College seriously debated whether or not to change its name to reflect its status as a university. The question of changing the college's name was first raised at a 1953 board of trustees meeting, where a motion was made to empower the president to negotiate a change of the name to 'Boston Catholic University'. Three years later, the name 'Botolph University' was considered. Input from the larger Boston College community flooded in when Maxwell opened the discussion to faculty, alumni, Jesuits, and administrators. The Dean of the School of Business Administration pushed for the name 'Jesuit University of Boston', and others suggested 'St. Robert Bellarmine University' and 'St. Thomas More University'. The debate continued even after Maxwell's presidency ended, only coming to a close in 1963 under the presidency of Rev. Michael P. Walsh, SJ. Maxwell ended his term as President of Boston College in 1958.  Later life and death  In 1960 Maxwell volunteered to serve as a missionary in Jamaica, then part of the short-lived West Indies Federation. He remained there for eleven years, working as a parish priest. He served as pastor of St. Joseph's Church in Falmouth, where he designed and built \\"a church of his own designing adapted both to the new liturgy and age-old semi-tropical heat of Jamaica.\\" The church was \\"the first of its kind in the Caribbean,\\" and was built by the Vaccino brothers. After being relieved of missionary duties in 1971, he embarked on a tour of Europe, where he died on 18 September 1971 in Ybbs an der Donau, Austria, at the age of 71. His body was sent back to the United States and was buried at Weston College Cemetery.

The game's plot follows maestro Angelo, the orchestra director, on the night before the premiere of Beethoven's Fidelio. A mysterious thief has stolen the musical scores; to retrieve them, Angelo must solve a series of music-themed riddles that have been scattered throughout the opera house. Gameplay The gameplay of Opera Fatal consists of first-person exploration as Angelo finds his way through the opera house. The player can interact with some specific objects by clicking or dragging them. Some items can be carried by Angelo to be used to solve a puzzle elsewhere in the opera house. The primary goal is to find the numbered questions left by the thief and to write down the correct answers in a book in the office. As more sets of questions are answered, more parts of the opera house become accessible. To aid the player in answering the questions, an interactive virtual library on music theory, musical instruments, the lives of several composers, and music history is available inside the game itself. Reception Opera Fatal was first released in German in 1996; later versions were released in Italian, English, French, and Dutch. Opera Fatal won several awards, including the 1997 Digita award for educational games and the 1996 Macromedia People's Choice Awards. It was also nominated for the 1997 Milia D'Or in Cannes.

Life  Already when he was a boy, Hafner had developed a talent for painting nature, trying to capture his impressions of the landscape and its fauna. Later, when he had reached his limits as an amateur, he decided to learn painting professionally. At the age of 19, he applied for a place at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart and studied for eight years with Carlos Grethe, Jakob Gr√ºnenwald, Robert von Haug, and Franz Herterich, and also with in Frankfurt. Due to his good performance, he received a scholarship for both a studio and lodging as well as a grant to study for six months in Italy. At that time the Art Academy aimed to empower aspiring artists to paint pictures for exhibitions. Hafner, however, was not compliant. It took years before he succeeded. He made amends with a return to his early passion. While his colleagues concentrated on the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and mainly modern styles, Hafner found his artistic fulfilment in painting flowers and landscapes.Thieme-Becker K√ºnstlerlexikon, E. A. Seemann. His love of Far Eastern painting also served as an inspiration. Grave of Christel and Fritz Hafner in Hage, East Friesland Decorations on the grave of objects found on the beach In 1907, he moved from Stuttgart to Thuringia, where he worked in an outdoor school community in Wickersdorf as an art and science teacher, which was his first job. Together with the reform of educators and principals Martin Luserke and other fellow teachers, such as and , he moved, in 1925, to the North Sea island of Juist, near the \\"Schule am Meer\\", a reform school that was run as a boarding school. Just as previously in Wickersdorf, he worked in Loog Juist as an art and science teacher. By that point, he had become fascinated with the hilly landscapes of W√ºrttemberg, Thuringia, and Italy, and their flora and the process of painting a shoal at the Wadden Sea. He painted there, with his paintings being characterized for their finely nuanced watercolors.Historisches auf der Nordseeinsel Juist ‚Äì Pers√∂nlichkeiten: Fritz Hafner , auf: juist.de, abgerufen am 7. After the school closed in 1934 due to economic and political reasons, Hafner remained in Loog with his wife Christel and their three children. He was forced by the loss of his income to enter his works in well-known exhibitions in major cities in Germany and to sell them if possible. This proved to be a difficult struggle, as he had to carry them with him, and also because he painted really only for himself and not with commercial interest. He therefore found it hard to be separated from his works. The Natural History Teaching Aids, a collection made at Schule am Meer, was presented by Hafner around 1934/1935 and was a small museum on the island of Juist with his exhibits on display. He agreed with the idea and was given the management of the museum, which he directed from 1934 to 1953, while his collection of paintings continued to expand.1934 ‚Äì Fritz Hafner, Heimatmuseum Juist, auf: juist.de, abgerufen am 7.

The present structure of the Church has five stages in its formation. It may well suit to compare its constructions with the different stages of the construction of Yerushulem Church in Old Testament. It may be the reason because this church is also christened as Kizhakkinde Yerushulem of Malankara. Though there are no much documents available about its beginning, there are decrypts written in stones mentioned about its second stage of development is available. The decrypts from the granite cross which was there in front of the church gives information about this second stage of construction.

One of those active in the formation of the Union of Unions was Pavel Milyukov, who later became the Foreign Minister in 1917. It was formed in the wake of Bloody Sunday, as the professional associations organized themselves at national level, to rally their members behind the liberal cause. The Union of Writers, Lawyers, Professors and Engineers were one of the first of these unions to be formed. They were soon joined by the Women's Union for Equality, despite some opposition from male leaders of the Union of Unions.Semi-professional associations, like the Union of Railway Workers and Employees, Union of Clerks and Book-keepers, and the Union of Pharmaceutical Assistants, became organized as affiliated associations. Their participation gave the intelligentsia a direct link with the masses, whom they had been distanced from.Figes, p. 181. After the founding of the Bulygin Duma in 1905, the radicals in the Union of Unions, alongside the Social Democrats, became more determined than ever to use \\"mass civil disobedience\\" as a weapon to pressurize the government to make further reforms and concessions, even though liberals chose not to boycott the elections to the Duma.Figes, p. 187. During the general strike in September 1905, after the most educated and wealthy of the working class ‚Äì the printers ‚Äì had gone on strike, the railway workers, and the Union of Railway Employees and Workers, followed suit. The union was affiliated with the Union of Unions, which themselves at the time had been discussing the possibility of a political general strike to aid their campaign for further reform for several months.Figes, p. 189. The political demands of the demonstrators was \\"remarkably uniform\\", which was a sign of the co-ordinating role that the Union of Unions played.Figes, p. 190. The Union of Unions served partly as the origin of the Petersburg Soviet, as they first came up with the idea of a workers council established to orchestrate general strikes.

The year 1836 saw the creation of a vocal music classes at the vocational school and that of instrumental music lessons from 1883. At that time, the music companies abound in Grenoble as Orph√©on founded in 1860 or Echo of the Alps, and not counting the military bands of the garrison troops. However, several projects to create a conservatory fail between 1871 and 1907. In 1907, the municipality of Charles Rivail is working to contact a dozen French cities with a questionnaire on how their music school.

Her scholarly work is credited with helping to establish the science of demography.Conrad Taeuber and Irene Barnes Taeuber, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, retrieved 2016-07-18. Life Irene Barnes was born on December 25, 1906 in Meadville, Missouri. She graduated from the University of Missouri in 1927, earned a master's degree in anthropology from Northwestern University in 1928, and completed her doctorate in sociology from the University of Minnesota in 1931. In 1929, while still a student, she married Conrad Taeuber; he and their children Richard and Karl would also become noted demographers. She took a faculty position at Mount Holyoke College in 1931, but in 1934 her husband joined the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and she moved with him to Washington, DC. She began working on the journal Population Literature of the Population Association of America; when its editor Frank Lorimer left the position in 1935, the journal moved to the Office of Population Research at Princeton University, where it became Population Index, and she moved with it. She was initially a research associate there (part-time while her children were young), and was promoted to senior research demographer in 1961; she retired in 1973. She died on February 24, 1974, of pneumonia and emphysema. Contributions As well as her work on Population Index, Taeuber directed the Census Library Project, a joint effort of the Library of Congress and the Bureau of the Census, from 1942 to 1945. She also chaired committees on population and demography for the Pacific Science Association and American Sociological Association, and served as president of the Population Association of America for 1953‚Äì1954. Taeuber wrote and edited many books and articles, totalling \\"a dozen influential books and book-length reports and some 250 articles and chapters.\\". But her most significant work was the book The Population of Japan (Princeton University Press, 1958). Nearly 500 pages long, this book is in seven sections. The first one gives a historical and sociological overview of Japanese life and culture, followed by sections on the Meiji period and the modern era. Next follow sections on internal migrations, the Meiji-era expansion of the Japanese empire, the effects of fertility and mortality on the population, and a demographic view of the effects of World War II on Japan with an eye to future possibilities...... This work \\"demonstrates the power of demographic analysis ... as an instrument for the description of social change\\". It was well-received in Japan, and a Japanese translation was published by the Mainichi Press. Recognition Taeuber was elected as a Fellow by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Sociological Society, and American Statistical Association (1960).List of ASA Fellows, retrieved 2016-07-16. She was given honorary doctorates by Smith College in 1960, and by the Western College for Women in 1965. The Universities of Missouri and Minnesota also awarded her accomplishments, as did the American Sociological Society, which gave her their Stuart. A. Rice Award in 1972. The Irene B.

Merloni was destined to follow her father into the business world but renounced his anti-religious sentiment and instead went down the religious path. Internal complications led to Merloni's fall from grace and she went into self-imposed exile where she received a dispensation to break from her religious vows. She later rejoined the congregation as a nun not long before her death. The beatification process commenced in 1988 under Pope John Paul II and she was titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis confirmed her heroic virtue on 21 December 2016 and named her as Venerable. Francis later confirmed a miracle attributed to her in 2018 and she was beatified in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome on 3 November 2018. Life Clelia Merloni was born on 10 March 1861 in Forl√¨ to Gioacchino Merloni and Teresa Brandinelli. She was baptized mere hours after her birth in the diocesan cathedral of Santa Croce from Bishop Pietro Paolo Trucchi.Gori, N. \\"Like a grain of wheat.\\" Effat√† Editrice, 2017 Merloni's mother died in 1864 and her maternal grandmother became her guardian. Her father remarried in 1866 to Maria Giovanna Boeri and both her grandmother and stepmother did their best to instill religious values and a love of God in her. Her father became far too engrossed in his work and his rising socio-economic status and this led to him exiting the faith and becoming instead an anti-clerical Freemason. Despite her frail health her father sought to provide her with the best education that was possible to attain in order to prepare her for following him in his business. She attended a private school in her town where she learnt basic skills such as reading and mathematics while also learning sewing and piano skills. Merloni began to demonstrate signs that her father's business ambitions were not intended for her and due to conflict of this nature her father began to grow suspicious of Merloni's grandmother and the things she was attempting to instill in his daughter ‚Äì it led to Merloni's grandmother being forced out of the house. The situation became aggravated when marriage struggles saw Merloni's stepmother leave the household to live with other relatives. She often fled to her room to do penance for her father's misdeeds and wore a pebble in her shoe to offer her sufferings for her father's withdrawal from the faith. The death of her father in 1895 ‚Äì who reconciled to the faith before his death ‚Äì saw his estate left to Merloni. Merloni later joined the Figlie di Santa Maria della Divina Provvidenza ‚Äì the order that Luigi Guanella founded ‚Äì and while there amongst the congregation in Como realized a call to form an order that would be devoted to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ. She founded that order ‚Äì on 30 May 1894 ‚Äì in Viareggio. She had left for Viareggio with her friend Elisa Penderzini while a third friend Giuseppina D'Ingenheim joined them a few weeks later before she founded her order. In 1896 a financial disaster ‚Äì due to her dishonest financial administrator ‚Äì bought about great humiliation on the order which in turn led to public opinion turning against them. Merloni was soon told that her life was in danger and was advised to leave Viareggio for elsewhere ‚Äì she sought refuge with the order based in Broni. It was to her benefit that she later met the Bishop of Piacenza Giovanni Battista Scalabrini and on 10 June 1900 the latter granted diocesan approval to Merloni's order and approved its Rule of Life. Also on 10 June 1900 the bishop accepted the profession of Merloni into her own order and the profession of ten other religious. The seat of the order then moved to Scalabrini's diocese of Piacenza. Scalabrini also desired that the congregation also extend to the foreign missions and on 10 August 1900 six of the religious departed from Genoa to S√£o Paulo in Brazil. Four more left in October 1900 for Santa Felicidade in Paran√† also in Brazil while six more sailed on 16 June 1902 from Genoa on the British ship \\"The Vancouver\\" for Boston to aid the Missionaries of Saint Charles Borromeo. In 1903 there were 30 houses with 200 sisters. Scalabrini's death in 1905 led to the motherhouse being transferred to Alessandria and also saw the decline of Merloni's good standing amongst the congregation. In 1911 the Vatican removed her from the leadership and named as Superior General Marcellina Vigano. She withdrew from the public due to this and in 1916 both requested and received a dispensation that would release her from her religious vows. During her exile Pope Benedict XV granted the decree of praise of the order on 17 July 1921. On 28 February 1928 she requested permission to renter the congregation and on 7 March 1928 was welcomed at the motherhouse in Rome where the order was now based since 1916. Vigano issued a circular letter that read: \\"Our most ardent desires have finally been fulfilled! ... Our beloved Mother Foundress is once again with us all of the seventh of this month. The Sacred Heart has restored her health so that she may now enjoy here in the motherhouse, surrounded by the love of her daughters, that peace and quiet which she needs so much, after so many trials and sorrows\\". Merloni died on 21 November 1930 and she was buried at Campo Verano but was later exhumed and found intact in 1945. Her remains were then transferred to the motherhouse of the order. The order itself now has 1200 members in nations such as Taiwan and Switzerland in 195 houses. Her order received full papal approval from Pope Pius XI on 24 March 1931 while Pope Pius XII approved the constitutions of the congregation on 17 October 1941. Beatification The initial steps for the beatification of Mother Clelia began in 1988 at the request of the Congregation of the Apostles of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The opening of the diocesan process took place in Rome on 18 June 1990 after she was titled as a Servant of God on 18 May 1990 when the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" decree. The process saw 60 witness testimonies come from Brazil and the United States in addition to from Merloni's native homeland. The diocesan phase ended on 1 April 1998 with the C.C.S. validating the process on 7 August 1999. In 2014 the postulation submitted the Positio - a detailed dossier of 1385 pages on her life and holiness that examined her virtue. In 2015 historical consultants for the C.C.S. had examined the dossier and confirmed her virtue while theologians followed suit on 25 October 2015; the C.C.S. confirmed this too on 13 December 2016. On 1 December 2016, Pope Francis signed the decree confirming her life of heroic virtue and named Merloni as Venerable. The miracle for her beatification was investigated in Rome from 25 January 2005 until 11 April 2011. Medical experts confirmed the miraculous nature of the healing presented on 23 February 2017 while theologians determined the miracle came as a result of her direct intercession on 27 June 2017. The C.C.S. confirmed these findings on 9 January 2018. On 27 January 2018 the pope approved the decree recognizing the miracle obtained through Merloni's intercession which approved her for beatification. The beatification was celebrated in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran on 3 November 2018. =Beatification miracle= The story of the miracle dates back to 14 March 1951, when the Brazilian doctor, Pedro √Çngelo de Oliveira Filho, was stricken suddenly by a progressive paralysis of all four limbs and was rushed to Santa Casa de Misericordia di Ribeir√£o Preto Hospital. He was diagnosed with an ascending progressive paralysis known as Landry's paralysis or Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. Within a few weeks the paralysis worsened and spread, resulting in acute respiratory failure. It eventually reached the glottis, causing great difficulty in swallowing. The prognosis was fatal in view of the seriousness of the condition and the limited medical options for a cure which were available at that time. When the paralysis reached the throat, the doctors discontinued treatments. On March 20 the patient was having great difficulty breathing and was barely able to swallow his own saliva. The doctors informed the family that he would not survive the night. With that news the patient's wife, Angelina Oliva, sought out Sr. Adelina Alves Barbos to ask for prayers. The sister gave her a novena to Mother Clelia along with a holy card containing a piece of fabric from the veil that Mother Clelia wore. Sr. Adelina, together with Angelina, her children, and other family members, immediately began praying. Sr. Adelina approached the sick man and gave him a cup of water in which she had placed the tiny relic. Although he was gravely ill, he managed to take some of the water. After a few minutes, those present noticed that he was able to swallow and was no longer losing saliva. Sr. Adelina tried giving him a spoonful of water, and he drank it. She then put a small amount of water in a cup and had him drink that. Then she poured some milk in a glass and gave it to him, and he drank it without any problem. Everyone was very amazed at the sudden improvement, so much so, that the sister went to the kitchen to prepare some custard. Pedro √Çngelo swallowed it easily. When the doctor on call arrived in the morning and saw the patient cured, he exclaimed that it was a miracle. Pedro √Çngelo continued to improve, and within three weeks he was walking normally. On 6 May he was released from the hospital for his healing was complete, permanent, and without relapse or signs of any symptoms. The doctor died on 25 September 1976, of cardiac arrest, thus from a completely different cause, 25 years after his miraculous cure.

History  Van Nuffel set many Latin texts to music, including ten psalms, for the liturgy and also concert at the Sint Rombouts Kathedraal in Mechelen, where he served as cantor, while Flor Peeters was organist. In the Latin Psalters the psalms are numbered differently. Psalm 121 there is Psalm 122 in the King James Bible. Van Nuffel set the psalm in April 1935 for a mixed four-part choir and organ.

It deals with the expectation to go to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem together with other pilgrims, expanding what Jerusalem means to them. The last four verses invite to prayer for the peace, security and prosperity for Jerusalem. Van Nuffel set the Latin text in one movement of different moods: The music in F minor and time is marked Con moto (with movement), initially marked mezzo-forte (). Soprano and alto begin \\"Laetatus sum\\" together with an ascending motif, which tenor and bass pick up the following measure in the opposite direction, and intensified by the organ in the third measure. \\"Illuc enim ascenderunt\\" begins slightly slower (poco allargando) in the basses, again with ascending motifs. The other voices join in vivid movement. The last psalm verse, \\"Propter bonum\\", prepared by a strong crescendo and ritardando, is rendered in calmer, majestic singing, accented by rising chords in the organ. The psalm is concluded by a repeat of the first verse, ending extremely softly () on a repeated \\"Jerusalem\\".

The film stars Sara Arjun, Sunny Wayne, and Aju Varghese. along with a cameo appearance by Dulquer Salmaan. It was later dubbed into Telugu as Pilla Rakshasi.The film was box office success. The film narrates the story of friendship of a schoolkid (Sara) and an easygoing youth (Wayne) and the changes this relationship brings about in their life. It was released on August 5, 2016. The plot of the film has some similarity with the 2008 film Drillbit Taylor.  Plot  Annmaria aka Ann is the 10-year-old daughter of Dr. Roy and his wife Dr. Teresa Roy. Roy tells Ann of how he went to Kakkadan Mala, a hill in his hometown and prayed for an angel. An angel appeared and blessed him, thus he got a medal in long jump. Ann dreams of meeting the angel and winning a medal in long jump. Ann overhears her mother advising their domestic help to call a goon and beat up an unwanted suitor. One day, she sees her English teacher being harassed by David, the PT master. She informs the principal, who then questions David. But David, who has political influence, escapes easily. He then begins to have a grudge on Ann. On the day of the sports trials, David deliberately disqualifies Ann as revenge. A heartbroken Ann plans revenge. She recalls what her mother said about hiring a goon. She approaches her friend Avinash (Master Vishal Krishna) for help. Avinash, although initially stunned, agrees to help. He approaches his friend Sarath, a boaster. Sarath arranges a goon, named Poombatta Gireesh, who is a relative of Sarath. Gireesh is actually a fraudster working with his good-for-nothing con friend Ambrose. Ann offers him an I-Phone 6S, as his fee, which he takes. He and Ambrose take the phone to Sabu, who owns a mobile shop. Sabu however cheats them and only pays 2000 in place of the real amount of 50,000. Ann and Avinash (Master Vishal Krishna) is eagerly waiting for Girish to beat up PT master, they confronts Girish and Ambrose who laughs the matter off. Ann seeks the help of her uncle who is a Sub Inspector in Police. Her uncle procures the iPhone from Sabu and give it to Ann. She confronts Girish again and says that she is ready to give iPhone provided he does the deed. To her luck there was a local goon whom Girish owes some money. He forces Girish to confront PT master and take the iPhone. With no other way Girish faces David and is knocked out in single kick. Ann seeks her mother help and hospitalises Girish. He later wakes at hospital and Teresa realises that it's through her conversation Ann got the idea of hiring a goon. Ann feels bad for Girish as he is badly beaten up. She gives all her savings plus some borrowed money from Teresa to Girish. This act of Ann deeply influence Girish and he wants to repay her by getting the iPhone back. Meanwhile, the relationship between Teresa and Roy is on a low note. She is contemplating a divorce and Roy hurries back to meet his family. Ann is exciting on meeting Roy and wants to spend some quality time with parents. She overhears discussion of her parents about divorce and is shattered. Girish gets to know from Sabu that he has sold iPhone to Baby, a self made millionaire realtor. He meets Baby and ask him to give back the iPhone. As Baby has the policy of not selling once bought items, Girish had to leave empty handed. But Girish is persistent and keeps bothering Baby. Finally late night when Baby is fully drunk and unable to drive, Girish drives Baby back to home. On reaching home Baby was impressed with honesty of Girish and offers him a full-time job as his driver. Girish, now a changed man develops good relationship with Baby and shares the story of iPhone. Baby gives back iPhone to Girish as token for his efforts. GIrish returns the iPhone back to Ann and become good friends with her. Ann is in double mind to participate for long jump in annual school meet. Girish offers to ride her to Kakkadan mala and arranges a person to role-play as angel. Baby shares tragic death of his daughter, and encourages Girish to make happen Ann's dream of meeting angel. Girish gets the permission of Teresa and drives her to the mountain top. Girish is worried if arranged person would show up on time. By coincidence someone (Dulquer Salmaan) comes as an angel. Ann is elated and tells her innermost wish. On their return journey David sees them and make out it's Ann who arranged to get him beaten up. During sports meet, David approaches Ann and shows the photograph and threaten her to get dismissed. She is shaken and while preparing for the jump she collapses. Girish knowing this musters the courage to challenge David and beats him black and blue. A little while later Ann is shown to be participating in a zonal level meet. Her first two jumps were fouls and is very disappointed. Suddenly the person whom she met at mountain top and mistook for angel shows up and encourages her. With a new found confidence she takes the jump and comes first. Girish reveals that her parents have reconciled and her father going to stay always with her thus giving a happy ending to the story.

Furthermore, UPd2Al3 orders antiferromagnetically at TN=14K, and UPd2Al3 thus features the unusual behavior that this material, at temperatures below 2K, is simultaneously superconducting and magnetically ordered. Later experiments demonstrated that superconductivity in UPd2Al3 is magnetically mediated, and UPd2Al3 therefore serves as a prime example for non-phonon-mediated superconductors. Discovery Heavy-fermion superconductivity was discovered already in the late 1970s (with CeCu2Si2 being the first example), but the number of heavy-fermion compounds known to superconduct was still very small in the early 1990s, when Christoph Geibel in the group of Frank Steglich found two closely related heavy-fermion superconductors, UNi2Al3 (Tc=1K) and UPd2Al3 (Tc=2K), which were published in 1991. At that point, the Tc=2.0K of UPd2Al3 was the highest critical temperature amongst all known heavy-fermion superconductors, and this record would stand for 10 years until CeCoIn5 was discovered in 2001. Metallic state The overall metallic behavior of UPd2Al3, e.g. as deduced from the dc resistivity, is typical for a heavy- fermion material and can be explained as follows: incoherent Kondo scattering above approximately 80 K and coherent heavy-fermion state (in a Kondo lattice) at lower temperatures. Upon cooling below 14 K, UPd2Al3 orders antiferromagnetically in a commensurate fashion (ordering wave vector (0,0,1/2)) and with a sizable ordered magnetic moment of approximately 0.85 ¬µB per uranium atom, as determined from neutron scattering. The metallic heavy- fermion state is characterized by a strongly enhanced effective mass, which is connected to a reduced Fermi velocity, which in turn brings about a strongly suppressed transport scattering rate. Indeed, for UPd2Al3 optical Drude behavior with an extremely low scattering rate was observed at microwave frequencies. This is the 'slowest Drude relaxation' observed for any three- dimensional metallic system so far. Superconducting state Superconductivity in UPd2Al3 has a critical temperature of 2.0K and a critical field around 3T. The critical field does not show anisotropy despite the hexagonal crystal structure. For heavy-fermion superconductors it is generally believed that the coupling mechanism cannot be phononic in nature. In contrast to many other unconventional superconductors, for UPd2Al3 there actually exists strong experimental evidence (namely from neutron scattering and tunneling spectroscopy ) that superconductivity is magnetically mediated. In the first years after the discovery of UPd2Al3 it was actively discussed whether its superconducting state can support a Fulde‚ÄìFerrell‚ÄìLarkin‚ÄìOvchinnikov (FFLO) phase, but this suggestion was later refuted.

It suits to remark also his work as a translator: the Divine comedy of Dante, and the theatre of Shakespeare, Moli√®re and Gogol. Part of his poetry was inspired by the popular chansonnier and by well known ancient legends, what turned him into a very popular poet that, in many respects, occupied the place that had left empty Frederic Soler, Verdaguer, Guimer√† or Maragall. In 1955 he won the National Prize of Theatre for La Ferida Luminosa, whose version in Spanish was made by Jos√© Mar√≠a Pem√°n.

The corridor frequently acts as a bypass route for congested I-64 High Rise Bridge traffic. It replaces the much shorter and smaller Dominion Boulevard Steel Bridge, which because of its 11-foot underwater clearance opened on average of 16 times per day. Tolling began on the route on February 9, 2017. Most cars, SUVs and passenger trucks that use the bridge and utilize an E-ZPass transponder will only pay $1 to cross. Larger vehicles, such as transit busses and semi-trailer trucks, will face an E-ZPass toll ranging from $1.50 to $2.50, depending on its classification. However, those same vehicles crossing without a transponder will still pay their respective base toll, but will also incur a $2 processing fee in addition to the original toll.

For this film, he roped in six national champions, including a couple of them with international acclaim. He also hired Vijaykumar, a professional motocross racer of many international awards, as a team coach to help with the proceedings. For the lead roles, he selected the fresh faces Prithvi and Malayalam actress Malavika Mohanan. Prithvi, the grandson of music director G. K. Venkatesh, is an engineering graduate and is trained in acting, stunts and dancing. Charandeep was chosen to play the antagonist as another race who is opponent to Prithvi. Prakash Raj was hired to play the trainer role and father of Charandeep. =Shooting= The principal photography of the film officially began from 15 December 2015 in Bangalore behind Manyata Tech Park where a race track was being set up for the shoot. The crew consisted of some technically professional racers whom Preetham wanted the scene to \\"look authentic, since it is a tough sport and any cover up by the technical team will show upfront.\\" The first schedule of filming ended at Ooty. For the climax portions, Preetham chose to shoot in Sri Lanka where two tracks are meant for the bike races. Soundtrack The soundtrack is composed by V. Harikrishna.

She created numerous soprano roles in operas and oratorios by Fux, Caldara, and her second husband, Francesco Bartolomeo Conti and was reputedly the highest paid musician in Vienna at the time.Sadie, Julie Anne (1998).

Retrieved 18 July 2016 . Life and career Landini's mother, Francesca Portui, was the maid of Queen Christina of Sweden and married to Francesco Landini, the captain of Christina's guards. However, Francesco Landini was not her real father. Maria was born from a relationship between her mother and the marquise Orazio Del Monte, Christina's chamberlain. According to 17th-century sources, she was born in Hamburg where Christina's court periodically sojourned, although the date of her birth has variously been given as 1667, 1668, and 1670. Maria spent her entire childhood and youth at the court of Queen Christina where she was trained as a singer and was known by the diminutive \\"Mariuccia\\". By the late 1680s there are records of her regularly performing in private musical evenings at Queen Christina's court in Rome. She often sang together with another favourite singer of the queen, Angela Voglia (known as \\"La Giorgina\\").Zilli, Anna (2014) \\"Christina of Sweden queen of music in Rome and the women singers at her service\\".

According to Francesco Conti's biographer Hermine Williams, Castelnovo was from an aristocratic family and his full name was Mallo di Castelnuovo. Their marriage would produce three children: Ferdinando, Francesca, and Caterina. Landini was active in the opera houses of Italy from 1698 when she was in the service of the Duke of Mantua. Her earliest appearance in Mantua was in 1698 in Bononcini's Il Trionfo di Camilla. She also appeared in Venice, Genoa, Casale Monferrato, Livorno, Modena, and Bologna before moving to Vienna in 1710 where she became the prima donna of Emperior Charles VI's court theatre. In 1714, following the death of her first husband, Landini married Francesco Bartolomeo Conti in Vienna's Schottenkirche. In her will, written in the year prior to her death, she asked to be buried in the Schottenkirche next to her first husband.

She was elected to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong as a member for Kowloon West in the 2016 Legislative Council election, but has since been disqualified pursuant to a judgement delivered by the High Court on 15 November 2016. Background Yau was born on 6 May 1991 at St Teresa's Hospital in Kowloon City, Hong Kong to a middle-class family. Both her parents were civil servants. Her father was a technical officer in the Hong Kong government. She was educated at Queen Elizabeth School and studied Chinese language at Lingnan University. She was an intern at Ta Kung Pao newspaper during her studies. She is a member of Youngspiration, a localist group formed by young people after the Umbrella Revolution. Youngspiration fielded nine candidates in the 2015 District Council elections, in which Yau ran against legislator Priscilla Leung in Whampoa East. As a newcomer, Yau received 2,041 votes, only about 300 votes less than Leung. After the district council election, Yau served as District Councillor Kwong Po-yin's assistant and Youngspiration's Whampoa community officer. Legislative Councillor and disqualification Representing Youngspiration in the 2016 Legislative Council election, she won the sixth and final seat in the Kowloon West geographical constituency. With 20,643 votes, Yau edged out incumbent Wong Yuk-man to become the youngest female member of the Legislative Council. She was the second youngest member behind localist Nathan Law, who also won within the same election on Hong Kong Island. On 12 October 2016, Yau and her party colleague Baggio Leung attended the swearing- in ceremony at the first Legislative Council session. The two of them inserted their own words into the official script and had their oaths rejected. They were criticised for pronouncing China as \\"Jee-na\\", a term considered derogatory since the Second Sino-Japanese War, and Yau mispronounced \\"People's Republic of China\\" as \\"people's re-fucking of Jee-na\\". As a result, their qualification as legislators were challenged by the government in court. The National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) intervened in the court case by interpreting Article 104 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong to \\"clarify\\" the provision of the legislators to swear allegiance to Hong Kong as part of China when they take office. The NPCSC insisted the oath taking must be conducted sincerely and accurately, and later stated that China would firmly oppose Hong Kong independence. On 15 November, the court disqualified the two legislators on the grounds they did not take their oaths \\"faithfully and truthfully\\". On 26 August 2017, the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong refused to appeal the case, claiming they did not have a reasonably arguable case. Leung and Yau were found to have manifestly refused and wilfully omitted to take their oath ‚Äì an act classed as declining and neglecting it. On 28 June 2019, Yau withdrew from the Youngspiration party. In May 2020, the Legislative Council Commission demanded Yau to repay HK$930,000 (US $120,000) from public funds, claiming that she was mistakenly paid the salary and funds granted to lawmakers.

J. Shinick, who owned a pair of hairless cats. The cats were novelties at this time because of their lack of a coat (fur), although they grew light fur along the back and tail in winter. These cats also had long whiskers and eyebrows. Because they had no coat, they lost more body heat than coated cats. This made them warm to the touch as well as heat-seeking. They are well documented in media reports in the early 20th century.  Breed standards  * There is no standard for this extinct variety.  Behavior  The cats' owner, Mr. Shinick, reported them to be intelligent, friendly and people-oriented. They enjoyed warm baths and liked to sleep in warm places, such as under bedclothes with a family member.  History of the cat breed In 1902, a couple from New Mexico received two hairless cats from local Pueblo Indians. These were purportedly the last survivors of an ancient Aztec breed of cat. The cats were litter-mates and noted to be 25% smaller than local shorthair cats. They were normally whiskered and seasonally coated, growing a ridge of fur down the mid-back and tail during the colder seasons. These were not the first hairless cats exhibited in the US, but they became the most famous. An earlier detailed report of a pair of hairless cats in The Boston Post, January 22, 1878. Two hairless cats, ‚ÄúScud,‚Äù a male, and ‚Äú Mystery,‚Äù a female, owned by William P. Marshall, were exhibited. These cats were a brother and sister. Although novelties, they had an ordinary background, being born to a normal shorthair cat, and did not become a sensation.The Boston Post: Poor Puss  January 22, 1878 In \\"The Book of the Cat\\" (1903, Public Domain) Frances Simpson reproduced a letter written by Mr. E. J. Shinick to Mr. H. C. Brooke regarding Mr. Shinick's hairless cats. Mr. Brooke commented \\"A most extraordinary variety, of which next to nothing appears to be known, is the hairless cat, and we cannot do better than quote in extenso the description given by the owner of what, if his surmise should unhappily prove to be correct, was the last pair of these peculiar animals, a portrait of which we give. We can only add, while deeply regretting that Mr. Shinick did not mate his cats, the earnest hope that we may hear that he has discovered the existence of other specimens.\\" Simpson, Frances, The Book of the Cat (Public Domain)  1903 From \\"The Book of the Cat\\", Frances Simpson, 1903 (public domain): \\"In answer would say my hairless cats are brother and sister. I got them from the Indians a few miles from this place. The old Jesuit Fathers tell me they are the last of the Aztec breed known only in New Mexico. I have found them the most intelligent and affectionate family pets I have ever met in the cat line; they are the quickest in action and smartest cats I have ever seen. They are fond of a warm bath, and love to sleep under the clothes at night with our little girl. They seem to understand nearly everything that is said to them; but I have never had time to train them. They are marked exactly alike - with mouse coloured backs; with neck, stomach and legs a delicate flesh tint. Their bodies are always warm and soft as a child's. They love to be fondled and caressed, and are very playful; will run up and down your body and around your waist like a flash. \\"Nellie\\" weighs about eight pounds, and \\"Dick\\" weighed ten pounds; but I am sorry to say we have lost \\"Dick\\". We have never allowed them to go out of the house, as the dogs would be after them. They were very fond of our water spaniel, and would sleep with her. \\"Dick\\" was a sly rascal, and would steal out. One night last year he stole out, and the dogs finished him. His loss was very great, as I may never replace him. The Chicago Cat Club valued them at 1,000 dollars each. They were very anxious for me to come on with them for their cat shows, but I could not go. They were never on exhibition; as this is a small city, I feared they would be stolen. I have made every endeavour to get another mate for \\"Nellie\\", but have not been successful. I never allowed them to mate, as they were brother and sister, and I thought it might alter \\"Nellie's\\" beautiful form, which is round and handsome, with body rather long. In winter they have a light fur on back and ridge of tail, which falls off in warm weather. They stand the cold weather the same as other cats. They are not like the hairless dogs, whose hide is solid and tough; they are soft and delicate, with very loose skin. \\"Nellie\\" has a very small head, large amber eyes, extra long moustache and eyebrows; her voice now is a good baritone, when young it sounded exactly like a child's. They have great appetites, and are quite dainty eaters - fried chicken and good steak is their choice. Have never been sick an hour. The enclosed faded picture is the only one I have at present - it is very lifelike, as it shows the wrinkles in its fine, soft skin. \\"Dick\\" was a very powerful cat; could whip any dog alone; his courage, no doubt, was the cause of his death. He always was the boss over our dogs. I have priced \\"Nellie\\" at 300 dollars. She is too valuable for me to keep in a small town. Many wealthy ladies would value her at her weight in gold if they knew what a very rare pet she is. I think in your position she would be a very good investment to exhibit at cat shows and other select events, as she doubtless is the only hairless cat now known. I have written to Old Mexico and all over this country without finding another. I would like to have her in some large museum where she would interest and be appreciated by thousands of people.\\" E J Shinick, Albuquerque, New Mexico, February 3rd, 1902 Simpson, Frances, The Book of the Cat (Public Domain)  1903http://messybeast.com/lostbreed-mexican.htm LOST BREEDS - MEXICAN HAIRLESS, or AZTEC CAT In ‚ÄúAnimal Life and the World of Nature‚Äù (Vol 1, 1902-1903),Animal Life and the World of Nature  Vol I, 1902-1903 Mr. Shinick was quoted \\"Dick was a very powerful cat, and could whip any dog alone; his courage no doubt was the cause of his death. He was a sly rascal and would steal out, and one night he got out and several dogs killed him. His loss was very great and I may never replace him. The Chicago Cat Club valued him at 1,000 dollars. I have sent all over the country and endeavoured to get a mate for 'Nellie,' but I fear the breed is extinct.\\" Mr. Shinick's cats, acquired in 1894,The Albuquerque Journal  April 3, 1956 were reported in the press as Aztec cats, the last of their kind. At that time, distinctive non-pedigree cats were sometimes exhibited as curiosities or celebrities and their stories were displayed on their cages. It is conceivable that the story of a nearly extinct Aztec breed was invented to make random-bred hairless cats appear more exotic. According to a report in The Albuquerque Citizen Albuquerque, New Mexico dated Wed, May 6, 1903, ‚ÄúT. J. Shinick was about the last man to shake hands with the president (Roosevelt). . . . Shinick gave him a little present for his sick boy Archie. It was a large photo of Aztec cats raised by the Indians, and the only two hairless cats known in captivity. Both the President and Secretary Loeb was greatly pleased with the picture.‚ÄùThe Albuquerque Citizen  May 6, 1903 The male cat, Dick, died in 1902 or 1903. In 1908, the female, Nellie, died. According to The New York Times of 31 December 1908:The New York Times  December 31, 1908 ‚ÄúCats and chickens were rivals for popular favor in Madison Square Garden yesterday, and the cats on the occasion, of the formal opening of the Atlantic Cat Club‚Äôs seventh annual ‚ÄúChampionship Show‚Äú had a shade the advantage. The opening of the cats‚Äô part of the exhibition was attended by the announcement of the demise of the greatest feline curiosity of the show in transit from Albuquerque, N. M., to make her appearance as a metropolitan star. The deceased was the hairless cat which had aroused great Interest among the exhibitors as the Aztec cat. The animal was regarded as something more than a curiosity, because of the antiquity attributed to its species, and it was stated by Dr. Cecil French of the Atlantic Cat Club that with the consent of the owner, T. J. Shinick, the hairless body would be presented to the Museum of Natural History here and may be offered in evidence that the cat had a part in Aztec as well us in Egyptian civilisation. The Aztec cat's misfortune gave opportunity for understudies, however, and a tame lynx and a tame ocelot now are rivals for the quarters that the hairless cat will not occupy.\\" According to the New York Tribune, also of 31st December, 1908,The New Tribune  December 31, 1908 ‚ÄúDeath, too, has invaded the exhibit, for the Mexican hairless cat died on the way to the scene of her expected triumph. This cat, which was the property of Miss. L. Spink, of Big Lake, Minnesota, is said to be the last of a famous Aztec race.‚Äù The owner's name appears to be an error. In The Albuquerque Journal of 29 December 1928 The Albuquerque Journal  December 29, 1928 (probably a reprint of an earlier article) it was reported ‚ÄúT. J. Shinick, of this city, received a letter from Washington yesterday saying that the hairless cat, Nellie, which he sent to the national cat show, died of dropsy.‚Äù Dropsy is an accumulation of water in the soft tissues, which can be due to heart failure or, in cats, feline infectious peritonitis. After that time, other randomly occurring hairless cats were also called (New) Mexican Hairless or Aztec cats. The term became generic instead of referring to the cats' location of origin. Charles Henry Lane reported in his book \\"Rabbits, Cats and Cavies\\" (1903) Lane, Charles Henry, Rabbits, Cats and Cavies  1903 that a Mexican Hairless Cat called \\"Jesuit\\" belonged to the Hon. Mrs McLaren Morrison (a notable cat breeder and collector of rarities). This was the only specimen Mr. Lane had seen and he believed it to be the only one ever exhibited in England. A portrait of the cat was included in his book. Jesuit could only have been another random mutation, because Nellie was too valuable to leave the USA. The San Francisco Chronicle, 11th, May 1919The San Francisco Chronicle  May 11, 1919 reported: ‚ÄúDr. Cecil French of Washington owned perhaps the strangest pet feline of all ‚Äì a hairless Aztec cat. On account of the great difference in climatic conditions between Washington and Mexico, the home of this feline curiosity, Dr French housed ‚ÄòMoko,‚Äô as his Aztec pet was known, in a glass case with regulated temperature.‚Äù It doesn't give the date when Dr. French owned a hairless cat, but 1919 is a decade after Nellie's death. Interest in the hairless cats of New Mexico was revived by Mr. H.C. Brooke in 1926. His queries were printed in The Albuquerque Journal of 12th January, 1926 and The El Paso Herald (Texas) of 15th March, 1926. He was extremely anxious to obtain specimens. Mr. Brooke's letter read: \\"They were obtained from some Indians, and that the Jesuit Fathers thought they were the last survivors of an ancient Aztec breed. Most unfortunately, Mr. Shinick didn‚Äôt mate the pair, because they were brother and sister, and apparently did not preserve the bodies on death.\\" The Albuquerque Journal  January 12, 1926El Paso Herald  March 15, 1926 Mr. Shinick's daughter, Mrs. Michael Palladino, replied in a letter to The Albuquerque Journal on 14 January 1926: According to Mrs. Palladino, her father had two of the hairless cats, a male and a female. He intended to mate them, but the male was stolen. The female he kept until she was about 13 years old, then sent her to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. She died soon after arriving in Washington, and Mrs. Palladino said the body was mounted for display in the museum. Mrs. Palladino believed that was in December, 1909. She did not know where her father obtained the cats.The Albuquerque Journal  January 14, 1926 The Montana Butte Standard, 26 December 1937 reported \\"Mexican hairless cats are supposedly extinct, a specimen is owned in New Mexico, says Mr. Crawford, and there may be others,\\" but this claim was not substantiated.The Montana Butte Standard  December 26, 1937 On 20 March 1956, The Albuquerque Journal printed another request for information: \\"John White, head of the department of information of the state extension service and the Experiment Station at New Mexico A&M; College, has a letter from an El Pasoan who wants information on what is called the Mexican, and sometimes New Mexico, hairless cat. White is stumped. So are the others in the department. The El Paso man first wrote to Mexico City College, Mexico City, for information. The college apparently told him the animal was mouse-colored and the underparts were pinkish. The animal also has a ridge of fur along the back and upper surface of the tail. Mexico City College advised the El Pasoan to write to New Mexico A&M.; Many know of the Mexican hairless dog, but, says white, if anyone has seen a New Mexico Hairless cat, or knows there is such an animal, he‚Äôd like to hear about it.\\" The Albuquerque Journal  March 20, 1956 Mrs. Palladino replied in The Albuquerque Journal, 3 April 1956 that her father, the late Thomas J. Shinick, had given her two hairless Mexican cats as pets. The year was about 1894. She called them Dick and Nellie. She played with them for years. One morning Dick didn't come home, and the family told her that the milkman had stolen him. When Nellie was about 15 years old, her father decided that because hairless cats were so rare, the Smithsonian Institution might be interested. Officials of the institution asked to see Nellie while she was alive. Mrs. Palladino said Nellie had arrived in Washington in good condition, but died a month later, after which she was exhibited as a taxidermy specimen.The Albuquerque Journal  April 3, 1956 This indicates that the Mexican Hairless, or Aztec, breed were a pair of hairless siblings given a fictionalised account of their origin and the romantic suggestion that they were the last of their breed. The term Mexican Hairless Cat became a generic term for any hairless cat until 1931 when hairless kittens were born to ordinary furred cats in France and were exhibited by Professor E. Letard.Vie A La Campagne  April 1935 References * Some material used from Messybeast.com with permission.

He worked in his parish as a staunch defender of the poor and of rural laborers - he himself came from rural origins - and encouraged popular devotions amongst the Colombian faithful. His beatification received the approval of Pope John Paul II who presided over the celebration on 9 April 2000. Life Mariano de Jes√∫s Euse Hoyos was born on 14 October 1845 as the eldest of seven children to Pedro Euse and Rosal√≠a de Hoyos Echeverri during an uncertain period of anti-religious sentiment. He was baptized on 15 October and received the sacrament of Confirmation in 1847. His great-grandfather Pedro Euse hailed from France. In 1860 he entered the College of Saint Joseph of Marinilla where he studied mathematics and passed all his studies with excellent results. From the age of sixteen in 1861 he harbored the desire of becoming a priest and was then entrusted to the care of his priest uncle Firmino Hoyos - the parish priest of Girardota - and received from him a cultural and spiritual formation. He commenced his studies for the priesthood on 3 February 1869 at a new seminary opened in Mendellin and was ordained as a priest on 14 July 1872. He began his clerical career as a curate to his uncle until his uncle died in January 1875 and he was transferred to Yarumal in 1876. In 1878 he was assigned as a parish priest in Angostura and spent the remainder of his life there. It was there that he became well aware of the parish difficulties such as the construction of an appropriate parish church. He then became the parish priest on 21 January 1882 after the death of the old and frail priest Rudesindo Correa. He became well noted for being a simple and effective preacher and tended to the social and spiritual needs of the poor of the region with a particular emphasis on rural laborers; he often called the poor \\"Christ's nobles\\". His particular parish was in an area that civil war often plagued - in which neither side favored the faith - so he had to several times hide in caves in the area to escape the fighting. The priest also encouraged popular devotions such as the Sacred Heart and encouraged recitation of rosaries amongst families. He became bedridden in mid-June 1926 with a serious infection and later died in the first few hours of 13 July 1926 due to U.T.I. He had been stricken - on 12 July - with enteritis. He said on his deathbed: \\"I have already lived long enough. Now my greatest desire is to be united to my Jesus. Beatification Intact remains. The beatification process opened in Santa Rosa de Osos on 2 April 1982 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints granted the official \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') to the cause and titled the late priest as a Servant of God. The cognitional process commenced and concluded following this declaration and received C.C.S. validation in Rome on 21 December 1984. The Positio then was submitted to Roman officials for further assessment while theologians voiced their approval to the dossier's contents on 9 May 1989 and the C.C.S. themselves following suit on 19 December 1989. The late priest became titled as Venerable on 3 March 1990 after Pope John Paul II confirmed his life of heroic virtue. The miracle required for possible beatification received diocesan investigation and then C.C.S. validation on 11 October 1996 while a medical commission met on two occasions - on 5 February 1998 and 4 April 1998 - to discuss and approve the miracle. The C.C.S. had their consulting theologians to evaluate the miracle and approve it on 25 September 1998 while the C.C.S. themselves voiced their assent to the miracle on 2 February 1999. The pope granted his final approval to the healing as being a credible miracle on 26 March 1999 and beatified the priest on 9 April 2000 in Saint Peter's Square. The current postulator that is assigned to the cause is Antonio S√°ez de Alb√©niz. =Miracle= The miracle that led to his beatification involved the cure of the priest Rafael Gildardo Velez Saldarriaga (b. 1912) from Medellin who underwent an operation for his prostate in 1970 though developed cancer on the scar in 1982. He had operations and also underwent cobalt and estrogen therapies and seemed to recover from his ailment - in March 1987 he contracted oedema of the legs that transcended to elephantiasis. Metastasis of the spinal column followed and the situation was pronounced terminal for him. In September 1987 he began to demonstrate signs of improvement and within two months the oedema was reduced and the cellulitis and bone metastasis all but disappeared. Doctors and scientists examined him in June 1991 and declared that there was no scientific explanation for the cure. Additional evaluations were done in 1997 in which it was declared he had recovered in full from his condition.

The name is due to Santana Srinivasa Perumal whose vigraham (idol) was found beneath the temple premises in Mugappair in Chennai. Santana Srinivasa blesses childless couple with children. History Around 650 years ago, Sri Arunachalam Mudaliar was informed about the existence of the Idol/Vigraham of Santana Srinivasa Perumal by Lord Vishnu himself in his dream in Mugappair. Sri Arunachalam Mudaliar started the construction of the temple and today it is a spacious temple near the heart of the city. There is a seven tier Raja Gopuram as we enter the temple, Santana Srinivasa Sannidhi, Santana Lakshmi Sannidhi and Andal Sannidhi. There is also sannidhi for Ganapathy and Anjaneya. Santana Gopala Pooja Santana Gopala Pooja is performed in this temple wherein couples are made to cradle/hold the Vigraham/Idol of Santana Gopala in their lap. The Santana Gopala Pooja is performed on Pournami and on the days with the stars of Tiruvonam, Punarpoosam, Swathi, Rohini and Revathi between morning 6:00 and to 12:00 noon. The Pooja articles include Tamboolam, honey, butter to be offered to Lord Krishna while holding him in the lap of the couple performing the pooja. The following Sloka is recited by the couple performing the Santana Gopala Pooja: Devakisuta Govinda Vaasudeva Jagatpathe, Dehime Tanayam Krishna Twaamaham Sharanam Gathaha, Devadeva Jagannatha Gotra Vridhi Karaprabho, Dehime Tanayam Sheegram Ayushmantam Yashashshreenam. The meaning of the Sloka is as follows: Govinda, the Son of Devaki is Vaasudeva the Father of this world, Give me with a child O Krishna! I surrender to you! O Lord of all Lords! May my Gothra/Lineage multiply (through the offspring born), Give me a Child early who would live long with fame. The honey and butter are given to the couple as prasadam who are required to take the Prasadam regularly after the pooja on a daily basis. They are also required to recite the sloka on a daily basis for 48 days for good results.

Encompassing more than of land in Appleton and Searsmont, the farm exemplifies the evolutionary history of farm properties in the Mid Coast region, with a variety of outbuildings reflective of changing trends in agriculture, and a c. 1825 farmstead that was not fitted for electricity or indoor plumbing until 2008. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Description and history The Whitney Farm property is located in eastern Appleton and western Searsmont, a rural inland area of Mid Coast Maine. The farmstead is located in Appleton, about downslope on the north side of Appleton Ridge. The farm property consists of a series of fields and woodlots, and is partly divided by Whitney Bog, which straddles the town line. The farmstead is a closely grouped collection of buildings at the northeastern end of Whitneyville Road, the access road to the property from Appleton Ridge Road. The main house is a c. 1825 Cape style wood frame building, with its exterior clad in a combination of clapboards and wooden shingles. Brick chimneys rise at the center of the main block, and in one of two single-story gabled ells that project from it. North of the house stands the barn, dating to the first half of the 19th century, from which a single- story series of garage bays projects southward. A second outbuilding was called the cooper shop by members of the Whitney family; it has two sections, one dating to c. 1900, and the other of older but uncertain age. This building also saw historical use as a chicken coop. Also to the east of the house is a long and rectangular poultry house. Two distinctive surviving outbuildings are a corn crib and ice house, both relatively unusual survivors in rural Maine.Mitchell, Christi (2015). NRHP nomination for Whitney Farm; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission This farm property was first settled about 1825 by John Tole, and was basically a subsistence farm in its early years. It remained as a diversified farm, growing in size with the success of several owners in the second half of the 19th century, and was purchased in 1878 by Martha and Hezekiah Whitney, whose descendants would own the property into the 21st century. Burton Whitney, of the second generation, was predominantly a cooper, producing barrels for potato farming businesses of Aroostook County, but specialized the farm into poultry.

Early life Born August 6, 1698, he began working with his father. Scherrer's family, originally from Stein, in the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland, were already organ builders of renown in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries building instruments in Switzerland, Germany, France and Spain. In 1726, the Council of Two Hundred in Bern authorized the return of the organs in the Protestant churches, which had been removed during the Reformation. This was an important market for Scherrer who moved to Bern from 1727 to 1732. He partnered with Emanuel Bossart for the construction of an organ of 33 plays and 3 keyboards, intended for the Church of the Holy Spirit. The finished the instrument in 1729, but the authorities refuse to buy it, having placed no orders. The partners separated and Scherrer borrowed to pay out Bossart. Career In 1726 (Nov 19th) Samson Scherrer married Verena Anna Edelmann, born about 1706 in Wildhaus, Canton St. Gallen. They had six children: Anna Catherina (named in 1729); Georg Ludwig (baptised in 1731) who was also an organ builder; Jacob (born in Lausanne in 1733) who followed his father as an organ builder and organist; Samuel Samson, (baptised in Geneva in 1739); Suzanne Pernette, born in Geneva in 1740); Bernard Nicolas, born around 1747, probably in Grenoble, who was also an organ builder, organist, harpsichordist and composer. In 1732, Samson Scherrer moved to Lausanne with his wife and children.√âglise Saint-Fran√ßois, Lausanne. He obtained permission to raise an organ at Lausanne Cathedral, but will be paid only thirty years later, in 1763. He then moved to Geneva, where the use of the organ was still banned in Protestant churches, so therefore sought work in France, and particularly in the Dauphin√© region. He works at St. Gregory's Church in Tallard (1743), the Church of Saint-Louis (1746-1747) and the Collegiate Church of Saint-Andr√© (1748), both in Grenoble. He enlarged and modifies the organ of the Abbey of Saint-Antoine (1748) and Gap Cathedral (1749-1750), and he rebuilt the great organ and built the small organ of Embrun Cathedral (1750-1751); his only completely new construction is one of his greatest instruments in France, that in Valence Cathedral.

The organ was completed in 1757, he adds 4 games in 1767. This organ was destroyed in 1865. In 1762 & 1763 he built a new instrument for the temple Fusterie or Neuf temple which his son Nicolas will hold (destroyed in 1835). He also reconstructed the one of the Auditorium in 1779.

Her initiatives led to the establishment of the first nursing school in Dublin. She was involved in numerous organisations promoting professionalism in nursing and campaigning for nurse registration throughout the British Isles.  Early life  She was born in Croydon, Surrey on 21 December 1854 to Esther (n√©e Hopkins) and William Thomas Huxley, a railway official who was the brother of the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley. She was inspired by Florence Nightingale's work and decided to become a nurse, even though her family were opposed to this idea. She trained at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, starting in 1880. Huxley became friends with the matron, Ethel Manson (later Mrs. Bedford Fenwick), and shared her ideas about promoting nursing as a profession.Susan McGann, ‚ÄòHuxley, Margaret Rachel (1854‚Äì1940)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press 2004 Career Her first job was at the Dublin National Eye and Ear Infirmary in 1883.AN APPRECIATION OF THE LATE MISS MARGARET HUXLEY, R.G.N., M.A. British Journal of Nursing, Feb 1940 She was soon invited to become Matron and Lady Superintendent at Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital where she started a new scientific training course for nurses leading to an examination. This had such a good effect on the quality of nursing there that Huxley got agreement from the medical establishment that a citywide school should be set up to cater for nurses from all local hospitals. In 1894 the Dublin Metropolitan Technical School for Nurses started its sixty-year life, offering \\"systematic teaching and uniform examinations\\".DUBLIN UNIVERSITY HONOURS MISS MARGARET HUXLEY, F.B.C.N., British Journal of Nursing, April 1928 Huxley was its first Honorary Secretary.Gerard Fealy, A History of Apprenticeship Nurse Training in Ireland, Routledge 2006, pp79-90 etc. She \\"worked wholeheartedly to secure the Higher Education of Nurses\\" said one report in a nursing journal. Huxley retired from Sir Patrick Dun's in 1902. One historian has speculated that this may have been a result of a dispute over whether the midwives there were sufficiently well trained to be called \\"nurses\\". It may, however, have been simply a wish to move on.Margaret H. Preston, Charitable Words: Women, Philanthropy, and the Language of Charity in Nineteenth-century Dublin, Greenwood 2004, p149 At this time she established a \\"Margaret Huxley memorial medal\\" for the best nurse in training. Huxley continued her nursing involvement through a private nursing home, Elpis, opened by her in 1890, which catered for middle-class Dublin Protestants. Nurses there were trained at Sir Patrick Dun's and the hospital found that the connection enhanced its reputation. Huxley became Sir Patrick Dun's first woman governor in 1912.  Post-retirement work  After \\"retiring\\" in 1902 Huxley had an opportunity to become more involved in a number of organisations which were pressing for state registration for nurses. Her continuing friendship with Ethel Fenwick and other London acquaintances had already seen her become a founder member of the Royal British Nurses' Association (1887), of the Matrons' Council for Great Britain and Ireland (1894) and of the International Council of Nurses (ICN) (1899). She was also a leading figure in the Irish Matrons' Association (founded 1903) and the Irish Nurses' Association (1904). Huxley attended many annual international conferences of the ICN and in 1913, as president of the Irish Nurses' Association, she arranged the first ever professional nurses conference in Dublin: a conference of the National Council of Nurses of Great Britain and Ireland. She was vice- president of the Society for the State Registration of Trained Nurses. and a fellow of the British College of Nurses. Huxley presented her arguments for state registration of nurses to a House of Commons Select Committee which sat in 1904‚Äì1905. She supported regulated standards of education with a formal registration procedure which would prevent untrained nurses from claiming to be qualified, and enable qualified nurses to move more easily between hospitals. The committee's report was sympathetic but the legal framework for registration was not introduced until 1919. Separate legislation for Ireland led to the founding of a General Nursing Council for Ireland in 1920. Huxley became its vice-chairman and also a member of its Registration Committee. She was not a supporter of Irish nationalism, however, taking more interest in international nursing issues, and her leadership roles in Irish nursing did not continue. Huxley was concerned about public health and housing and believed that an improved domestic environment for poor people would be beneficial to their health. The modest but well-planned houses in Huxley Crescent, Dublin, were built by a trust fund she set up. Her own time and money went into philanthropic projects of this kind. She worked with a Housing Society whose members were drawn from the Unitarian church congregation (which she is believed to have joined around 1912) and provided a \\"substantial donation\\".Oscailt magazine for Cork and Dublin Unitarian Churches: Memorials to a Great Woman She is remembered with a stained glass window at the Unitarian church in St. Stephen's Green.Dublin Unitarian Church Building During the First World War Huxley worked for the Red Cross and the Voluntary Aid Detachment Hospital in Dublin but refused the honour of a Royal Red Cross for her work: because she disliked \\"publicity and honours\\" and was described by her contemporary, Alice Reeves, as a \\"woman of very simple tastes... unostentatious and self-disciplined\\". Later she accepted honorary membership of the Finnish Nurses' Association (1925) and an honorary degree from Dublin University in 1928, at which time she was called the \\"pioneer of scientific nursing in Ireland\\". She died on 10 January 1940 and her funeral service was at the Unitarian church.

The building corners have Corinthian pilasters, supporting continuations of the entablature around the building. The rounded section is covered by a circular domed roof section topped by a lantern structure designed in emulation of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, while the remainder of the building roof is flat. A low flight of stairs rises to the two main entrances in the curved section, set in elaborate surrounds with bracketed entablatures. with The post office was designed by James Knox Taylor, then head of the Office of the Supervising Architect of the United States Treasury Department, and was completed in 1911.

The National Basketball Association is investing millions to increase a foothold in the African market. Hakeem Olajuwon is considered instrumental in developing and popularizing Basketball in Africa.  History  Introduced to Africa around the 1960s basketball has become a very popular sport. After more people took notice and practiced, professional teams were formed. The managers of the first African National Federation decide to participate and compete in FIBA, which is the world basketball governing body. Held on the 30th and 31 August 1960 the FIBA Congress allowed the Egyptian Basketball Federation to set up an institution in order to compete. This led to the integration of twelve African countries to join FIBA and the world stage. These countries include Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Egypt, Ghana, Guinea Conakry, Mali, Morocco, Libya, North Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Togo. Currently, FIBA Africa grew to a point where every single country in Africa has a designated team, leading to 54 active teams in the institution.

He was voted the most valuable player of two NBA finals, and he is both a Basketball Hall of Fame player and FIBA Hall of Fame player.

Each portfolio is led by a government minister who is a member of the Parliament of Queensland, appointed by the Governor as the representative of the Crown. The agencies are principally grouped as eight departments, each led by a secretary or director-general and comprising a number of portfolios covering specific policy areas across the department and allocated statutory authorities, trading enterprises, boards, councils and other public bodies. Agencies have varying levels of operational autonomy, and deliver one or more of frontline public services, administrative functions and law enforcement. Some are structured as for-profit corporations. Where there are multiple portfolios within a department, directors-general may be accountable to a number of ministers. In addition to the list below, a range of other agencies support the functions of the departments. The government is responsible for a number of corporations, of which the responsible minister typically holds a 100% ownership stake in. In 2006, Premier Peter Beattie privatised a number of government owned electricity retailers. On 2 June 2009 the government announced the 'Renewing Queensland Plan' that would sell state-owned railway, port and forestry assets to raise $15 billion, and avoid a further $12 billion required in future capital investment. On 18 May 2010, Queensland Forestry Plantations was the first commercial business to be sold. All agencies are identifiable by their corporate logo, which features in agency advertising, publications and correspondence, pictured right.

It preserves fragments of Atlantic Forest vegetation, including endangered plant and animal species. Location Map of the ESEC The Mata Preta Ecological Station (ESEC) is in the municipality of Abelardo Luz, Santa Catarina. It has an area of . The ESEC lies just south of the border with the state of Paran√°. It is along the south of the section of the BR-280 highway between Clevel√¢ndia and Palmas, in three separate sections. The SC-155 highway divides the eastern section from the central section. The buffer zone is wide and includes part of the municipality of Clevel√¢ndia. History The Mata Preta Ecological Station was created on 19 October 2005. The process was very confrontational, with strong opposition from the landowners. The consultative council was created on 1 September 2010. As of 2016 the legal status was still not finalized and the owners of land in the ESEC had not been compensated. No field studies had been undertaken and there was no management plan. The ESEC is classed as IUCN protected area category Ia (strict nature reserve). It has the objectives of conserving nature and supporting scientific research. It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). Environment The terrain is hilly, cut by small watercourses that feed the Chapec√≥ River in the Uruguay River basin. Altitudes range from above sea level. Average annual rainfall is . Temperatures range from with an average of . The ESEC is in the Atlantic Forest biome. Vegetation is mainly mixed rainforest. The three sections of forest are in different stages of regeneration. One of them is well-preserved and holds an immense stand of Araucaria angustifolia, with tree species in the under story typical of the primary forest formation such as Ocotea porosa, Sloanea lasiocoma and Ilex paraguariensis. The other two fragments show the impact of human activity, with clearings in which there are different stages of succession growth. However, they contain rare and endangered tree species. Important tree species include Dicksonia sellowiana, Parapiptadenia rigida, Cordia trichotoma, Ocotea pulchella, Nectandra lanceolata, Cedrela fissilis, Psychotria leiocarpa and Aechmea recurvata. Protected mammal and bird species include the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), colocolo (Leopardus colocolo), cougar (Puma concolor), pygmy brocket (Mazama nana) and vinaceous-breasted amazon (Amazona vinacea). The buffer zone contains small agricultural settlements, small and large farms and large pine plantations. There are huge fields of soy beans, wheat and corn. The region is under intense pressure from logging and agriculture. Apart from fragmentation, the ESEC is threatened by hunting, fires in the buffer zone fields in late winter, abandoned domestic animals, capture of wild animals for breeding in captivity and invasive exotic species.

He is commemorated by a brass effigy at St. Mary's Church in Blakesley. Life Mathew Swetenham first appears in the historical records when Richard II 'granted him 6 pence a day being retained as Saggitarius dei Corona (Archer of the Crown)'. In 1390, he was appointed Yeoman of the Chamber. After Richard II was deposed in 1399, Swetenham transferred his allegiance to Henry IV who granted him ¬£30 per year from properties in Northamptonshire. In 1405, he was made Yeoman of the King's Chamber, armour bearer and High Sheriff of Northamptonshire. Following Henry IV's death in 1413, Swetenham continued to serve under Henry V. The town of Swettenham in Cheshire was named after Mathew Swetenham, whose descendants continued to live there for some 350 years. The Swettenham's country house was Somerford Booths Hall. Mathew Swetenham was an ancestor of the British colonial administrator Sir Frank Swettenham.

Tomb of Nakht, 18th dynasty, Thebes, Ancient Egypt Human interactions with fungi include both beneficial uses, whether practical or symbolic, and harmful interactions such as when fungi damage crops, timber, or food. Yeasts have been used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been exploited to create a wide range of industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology. Fungi have appeared, too, from time to time, in literature and art. Fungi create harm by spoiling food, destroying timber, and by causing diseases of crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like Penicillium and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause the majority of plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845‚Äì1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly the main cause of economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; Aspergillosis kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened immune systems. Context Culture consists of the social behaviour and norms found in human societies and transmitted through social learning. Cultural universals in all human societies include expressive forms like art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies like tool usage, cooking, shelter, and clothing. The concept of material culture covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of social organization, mythology, philosophy, literature, and science. This article describes the roles played by fungi in human culture. Practical uses =Fermentation= Bread dough leavened with yeast Yeasts have been used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, fungi have been used for a wide variety of industrial fermentations, whether working directly for their effects on materials such as processing paper pulp or bioremediating industrial waste, or serving as the source of enzymes for many purposes, such as fading and softening denim for fashionable blue jeans. Fungi yield a wide variety of industrial enzymes including amylases, invertases, cellulases and hemicellulases, pectinases, proteases, laccases, phytases, alpha- glucuronidases, mannanases, and lipases. =Food= Penny bun or cep mushrooms collected from the wild The fruiting bodies of many larger fungi such as the chanterelle and the cep are collected as edible mushrooms. Some, such as truffles, are esteemed as costly delicacies. English translation A few species such as Agaricus bisporus and oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus spp.) are cultivated. Mould fungi produce foods like tempeh, savoury Javanese fermented soybean cakes. Mould fungi are the source of the meaty (umami) flavour of the soybean products tempeh, miso and soy sauce. Tempeh has been produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, it is made into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. Soy sauce has been used in China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.Leboffe, Michael; Pierce, Burton. Microbiology Laboratory Theory and Application. Morton. 2nd edition, p.317. The mould Penicillium roqueforti contributes the blue coloration and much of the flavour in blue cheeses such as Roquefort and Stilton. Mould fungi are processed to produce vegetarian meat substitutes such as Quorn. = Dyes = Fungi are used as natural dyes. The mushrooms are crushed and placed in a non-reactive pot to simmer for as long as desired or until you achieve a desired depth of color. Mushrooms that can be used without a mordant are called \\"substantive dyes\\", but in order to improve color and light fastness a mordant (metallic salts) can be used. Protein fibers, like wool and silk, quickly take the dye, but cotton, hemp and some synthetic fibers can be used too. =In modern medicine= An early industrial penicillin bioreactor, from 1957 Fungi are the sources of many types of medicinal drug including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and statins. Major classes of antibiotics, the penicillins and the cephalosporins, are derived from substances produced by fungi. So also are the immunosuppressant macrolides, the cyclosporins. The cholesterol-lowering drugs, the statins, were initially produced by fungi including Penicillium. The first commercial statin, lovastatin, was fermented by the mould Aspergillus terreus. Numerous anti-cancer drugs such as the mitotic inhibitors vinblastine, vincristine, podophyllotoxin, griseofulvin, aurantiamine, oxaline, and neoxaline are produced by fungi. =In folk medicine= Many fungi have been used as folk medicines around the world, including in Europe and in India where traditions are well documented. Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as Ustilago tritici (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a slice of mouldy bread or mouldy wheat straw, with active ingredients patulin and other penicillin-like compounds. In East Africa, pre-colonial practice of craniotomy involved the use of fungi to prevent the onset of sepsis. Yeast colonies on an agar plate. This \\"frogging\\" assay compares the viability of different yeast mutants. =In science= The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been an important model organism in modern cell biology for much of the twentieth century, and is one of the most thoroughly researched eukaryotic microorganisms. It was the first eukaryote whose genome was sequenced. In the twentyfirst century, the filamentous mould Aspergillus has been adopted for genome studies. =In pest control= Locusts killed by the naturally occurring fungus Metarhizium, an environmentally friendly means of biological control. CSIRO, 2005 Entomopathogenic fungi infect and kill insects, including a variety of pest species, so they have been investigated as possible biological control agents. A variety of Ascomycetes, including Beauveria, Lecanicillium, Metarhizium, and Paecilomyces have promising features for use as biological insecticides. Metarhizium in particular can help to control outbreaks of locusts. Symbolic uses =In religion and witchcraft= The liberty cap mushroom Psilocybe semilanceata is gathered for its psychoactive effects. Some species such as the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain. These are the focus of academic study and intense debate in the field of ethnomycology. In the 1950s, the American banker Robert Gordon Wasson participated in a Mazatec psilocybin mushroom ritual, and wrote an influential but controversial book claiming that the Soma mentioned in the Rigveda was Amanita muscaria, the fly agaric.In 1970, the philologist John Allegro destroyed his career by claiming that the fly agaric was the main focus of worship in the more esoteric sects of Sumerian religion, Judaism and early Christianity. The mycologist John Ramsbottom however confirmed one element that Allegro later wove into his theory, stating in 1953 that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil fresco in the Plaincourault Chapel depicted Amanita muscaria. The ergot fungi whose sclerotia appear as \\"black grain\\" in rye and other cereals are implicated in the witch trials of 17th century Norway, where the hallucinations caused by ergotism, with visions of Satan as a black dog or cat, caused people to be accused of witchcraft. People in other cultures such as the Aztecs brewed drinks with ergot, which contains alkaloids based on lysergic acid. =In literature and art= Fungi have appeared from time to time in literature, both for children and for adults. In Lewis Carroll's 1865 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Alice grows larger if she eats one side of the mushroom, and shrinks if she eats from the other side. Shakespeare has Prospero remark in The Tempest that elves \\"make midnight mushrooms\\". Poems and novels about or mentioning fungi have been written by Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Keats, Tennyson, Arthur Conan Doyle, D. H. Lawrence, and Emily Dickinson. Tennyson referred to the fairy ring mushroom (Marasmius) with the phrase \\"the fairy footings on the grass\\". Fungi sometimes feature in works of art, such as by Paolo Porpora in the late 17th century. The children's author Beatrix Potter painted hundreds of accurate watercolour illustrations of fungi. More recently, artists such as Martin Belou, Helen Downie (alias \\"Unskilled Worker\\"), and Steffen Dam have created installations and paintings of mushrooms. Harmful interactions =Food spoilage= An apple spoiled by a soft Penicillium type fungal rot Fungi, especially moulds but also yeasts, are important agents of food spoilage. Penicillium moulds cause soft rot such as of apples, while Aspergillus moulds create patches on the surface of old bread, yoghurt and many other foods. Yeasts spoil sugary foods such as plums and jams, fermenting the sugars to alcohol. Scientific understanding of spoilage began in the 19th century with works such as Louis Pasteur's 1879 Studies on Fermentation, which investigated the spoilage of beer.Pasteur, Louis (1879) Studies on fermentation: The diseases of beer, their causes, and the means of preventing them. Macmillan. =Destruction of timber= Saprotrophic wood-decay fungi are the primary cause of decomposition of wood, causing billions of dollars of economic damage each year. Fungal decay, while useful in composting, is destructive of timber exposed to the weather, and in the case of dry rot caused by Serpula lacrymans, also of timbers in largely dry houses. Some wood-decay fungi such as the honey fungi, species of Armillaria, are parasites of living trees, attacking their roots and eventually killing them, and continuing to decompose the wood when they are dead. Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, as it can spread from tree to tree by long strap-shaped rhizomorphs in the soil. =Diseases of crops= The Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849, caused by potato blight. Skibbereen engraving by James Mahony, 1847 Fungi are important crop pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect a wide range of crops around the world, cause some 85% of plant diseases, and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi involved is also wide, including Ascomycetes such as Fusarium causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smutsSchumann G. L., D'Arcy C. J,. 2006. Essential Plant Pathology. The American Phytopathological Society. St. Paul. pp. 28‚Äì29. and Puccinia causing cereal rusts, and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where crop diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire crop, as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured crop of maize (corn) in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' seedless banana crop was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, Fusarium oxysporum. It was replaced by the Cavendish banana, which in turn was in 2015 facing total destruction by the same disease. =Diseases of humans and livestock= Pathogenic fungi cause a variety of diseases in humans and livestock. Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Candida yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, throat, and genital tract, and more seriously of the blood. Ringworm is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.

Pre-launch The Progress MS-04 was launched into orbit on the Soyuz-U rocket before the switch to a new- generation Soyuz-2 family, which did not depend on avionics produced in Ukraine. This move to the new variant acquired a new political significance after the Kremlin's confrontation with Kyiv in 2014. However, inside the Russian space industry, this move became controversial after the loss of the Progress M-27M spacecraft on 28 April 2015, which was blamed on design features specific to the third stage of the Soyuz-2 rocket. Although the Soyuz-2 was officially declared fully operational in March 2016, there was lingering concern over this variant's reliability in the long term, stressing the need for a potential backup. The rocket issue remained open as the Progress MS-04 launch campaign got underway. The mission of Progress MS-04 was previously scheduled for 1 July 2016, but it later slipped back, along with the rest of the ISS flight manifest. Following the lengthy delay with the launch of the Soyuz MS-02 mission in September 2016, the liftoff of Progress MS-04 was rescheduled to 1 December 2016. According to the flight schedule, Progress MS-04 was scheduled to dock at the Zvezda service module, on 3 December 2016, at 16:43:06 UTC, during the 34th orbit. The nominal docking was expected to be fully automated with Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Oleg Novitsky at the inside of the station, ready to engage manual remote- control. Progress MS-04 carried a number of significant items, including the upgraded Orlan-MKS spacesuit for Russian spacewalks, a mini-greenhouse and an experimental system to recycle water and urine, the official Russian TASS news agency reported. Launch failure Progress MS-04 was launched on 1 December 2016 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. It used the second to last Soyuz-U rocket. The Progress MS-04 mission was to use the two-day, 34-orbit trip to the station instead of the previously available six-hour rendezvous profile. The launch proceeded normally until telemetry was lost at T+382.3 seconds, about two minutes into the Blok I stage burn. At this time, the Progress apparently separated from the third stage, almost six minutes earlier than nominal. A high altitude explosion was reported over the skies of Tuva, and debris from the third stage and Progress impacted in a mountainous area approximately 3500 km downrange from Baikonur. Roscosmos has confirmed the loss of Progress MS-04. The loss of the spacecraft occurred at an altitude of 190 km above deserted mountainous terrain in Tuva. Cargo The Progress MS-04 spacecraft was carrying about 2450 kg of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station. The spacecraft was delivering food, fuel and supplies, including 705 kg of propellant, 50 kg of oxygen and air, and 420 kg of water. Progress MS-04 was scheduled to dock with the aft docking port of the Zvezda module. Investigation On 3 December 2016, Roskosmos said that the Soyuz-U rocket with the Progress MS-04 spacecraft had been insured for 2,135 billion rubles through VTB Strakhovanie. The State Corporation also said that the Interagency Commission led by Roscosmos Head Igor Komarov and his Deputy Aleksandr Ivanov was scheduled to complete the investigation by 20 December 2016. Preliminary investigation found that the Progress had separated from the third stage six minutes and 23 seconds into launch, and that third stage telemetry failed. The reason for the premature separation was unclear. Although the Blok I computer system was capable of issuing a manual shutoff command in the event of a malfunction, this could only occur if engine chamber pressure dropped below a certain level or the booster began deviating from its flight path and telemetry data up to the point of the malfunction indicated normal third stage performance. Sensing normal separation, the Progress began deploying its antennas and preparing to fire its propulsion system, but the Blok I was still thrusting and apparently collided with the spacecraft at least twice, sending it into a tailspin and possibly rupturing the instrument module. As evidence of this, the Progress began activating its thermal control system in response to loss of instrument module compartment temperatures. It was suspected that the loss of Blok I telemetry could have been caused by the collision with the Progress, which may have damaged antennas on the booster. The separation command was normally issued by the third stage following engine cutoff, but the Progress could issue a backup command itself, which was maintained as a possible cause of the malfunction. On 11 January 2017, Roscosmos announced the results of an investigation into the cause of the failure. Most likely, the oxygen pump of the Blok I third stage engine (11D55) caught fire and disintegrated, rupturing the oxygen tank. The fire was probably caused by \\"foreign particles\\" in the pump, or an assembly error. On 23 January 2017, Ivan Koptev, Director General of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise Voronezh Mechanical Plant resigned for unsatisfactory performance and quality of products. On 28 January 2017, the Russian government announced as a result of the investigation into Progress MS-04 the recall of all Proton-M 2nd and 3rd stage engines produced by the Voronezh Mechanical Plant (common to the failed Progress flight) including the disassembly of three completed Proton rockets and a three and a half month suspension of flights. An investigation had found that engine parts that were supposed to use precious metals had been substituted for cheaper alternatives that were unable to resist high temperatures as well as finding that production and certification documentation were falsified.

It had the following improvements: * New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites. Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers. First time installed on Progress MS-03. * Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism. * Improved Micrometeoroid (MMOD) protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment. * Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations. * GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination. * Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station. * New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations. * The Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V on board radio system and antenna/feeder system has been replaced with a Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS). * Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system. Pre- launch The launch of the Progress MS-05 mission was originally planned for 16 October 2016, and by the end of 2016, it was postponed to 21 February 2017, in the wake of the Progress MS-04 accident. The extra time was used to return the third stages of already assembled vehicles to the manufacturing plant for additional inspections of RD-0110 engines, which were suspected in the loss of Progress MS-04. The engine on the third stage of the Soyuz-U vehicle assigned for the Progress MS-05 mission was replaced. The Soyuz-U rocket for the Progress MS-05 mission and all subsequent launchers carrying Soyuz and Progress spacecraft were retrofitted with onboard cameras capable of transmitting live images during the ascent to orbit. The cameras were installed on the exterior of the intertank compartment of the third stage. The resulting video could help to understand the rocket's behavior during the flight. The launch of Progress MS-05 was to be ensured for 139.8 million rubles.  Cargo  The Progress MS-06 spacecraft delivered 2,640 kg of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station, including an Orlan-MKS spacesuit. This was a replacement for the suit lost on Progress MS-04. The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: * Orlon-MKS space suit: 156 kg * Fuel: 880 kg * Oxygen and Air: 51 kg * Water: 420 kg Launch Progress MS-05 was launched on 22 February 2017 at 05:58:33 UTC from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. It used the 786th and last Soyuz-U rocket. Docking Progress MS-05 docked with the Pirs module at 08:34 UTC on 24 February 2017. During the automated docking process, Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Oleg Novitsky were on stand by at the manual control system, TORU, console inside the Pirs service module to take over docking operations if needed. Progress MS-05 will remain docked at the station for almost four months before departing in June 2017 for its deorbit into Earth's atmosphere. Undocking and decay After six months at the International Space Station, the Progress MS-05 cargo ship undocked from the Pirs, on 20 July 2017, at 17:46 UTC. The three-minute braking maneuvre with the main engine of the cargo ship was scheduled to begin at 20:58 UTC, followed by reentry into the dense atmosphere at 21:32 UTC on 20 July 2017. Surviving debris of the spacecraft were calculated to impact the remote area of the Pacific Ocean at 21:41 UTC on July 21.

He completed his college career in 2016 after having split his career playing for Niagara University and Hofstra University. Green went unselected in the ensuing 2016 NBA draft. High school career A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Green's played his prep years at Archbishop John Carroll High School. He had a successful career and garnered a number of awards and records, including: leaving as the school's all-time leading scorer (1,492 points); being named to the first-team All-Catholic League, all-city, and all-state honors as a senior; being named the Delco Times and Mainline Player of the Year as a senior; he was also named the Catholic League Co-Player of the Year in 2011; Green led Patriots to the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association Class AAA state championship in 2009; and he also earned All-American honorable mention honors from Max Preps as a junior. College career Green began his college career playing for Niagara University. He and close childhood friend Ameen Tanksley had grown up talking about playing college basketball together, and they both fulfilled that promise by deciding to play for head coach Joe Mihalich. Green powered Niagara to good seasons in 2011‚Äì12 and 2012‚Äì13, where the Purple Eagles won the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) regular season championship in the latter year. In 2011‚Äì12, Green was named the MAAC Rookie of the Year and was voted to the all-MAAC third-team. CollegeInsider.com named him their national freshman of the year. In the championship season, he moved up to become a first-team all-conference selection as just a sophomore. When Mihalich took a new head coaching job at Hofstra University following 2012‚Äì13, both Green and Tanksley decided to follow him to the new school. Green has already scored 1,131 points at Niagara, but due to NCAA regulations, he and Tanksley had to redshirt the 2013‚Äì14 season at Hofstra due to being transfer players. Green became eligible to play for the Pride upon the 2014‚Äì15 season and made an immediate impact. He averaged 17.1 points per game and was named a first-team all-Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) player. Hofstra named him their winner of the annual James M. Shuart Award, given to the school's male student-athlete of the year. Despite his personal success on the court, the team itself struggled to 10 wins, largely due to fallout from a scandal the year before that had preceded Mihalich's tenure. The following year, Green's senior season, Hofstra went 14‚Äì4 in CAA play and shared the regular season championship with UNC Wilmington. His 17.8 points per game ranked second in the CAA, while his 7.1 assists per game ranked first in the conference and sixth nationally; Green also ranked third in the CAA with 1.6 steals per game. On December 28, 2015, he recorded the first triple-double in Hofstra history after compiling 15 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists against LIU Brooklyn. Less than six weeks later, on February 7, 2016, Green made history again. He scored his 1,000th career point in a Hofstra uniform, becoming just the fourth men's basketball player in NCAA Division I history to score 1,000 points at two different schools. Toward the end of the season Green was named the Colonial Athletic Association Player of the Year and received 35 out of 40 possible votes. Among other national honors, the Associated Press named Green to the honorable mention All-America team. Green left Hofstra with 1,186 points (22nd in school history as of his graduation), 463 assists (sixth in program history), and the single-season assists record holder after he accumulated 243 in 2015‚Äì16. Overall, Green finished his college career with 2,317 points, 773 assists, 531 rebounds, and 230 steals. Professional career Green went undrafted in the 2016 NBA draft despite his college success. He started his pro career with the newly promoted to the Greek Basket League club Kymis.

Biography  He studied percussion at the Musikhochschule Basel with Siegfried Schmid and with Isao Nakamura in Karlsruhe. His studies included the traditional south Indian percussion-music, specially the Mridangam from 1995 till 1998 and the Arabic percussion music during a three months residency in Cairo, Egypt from November 2007 till January 2008. He also worked as a percussion teacher at the Musikakademie Basel for many years. Daniel Buess was involved in various groups and Ensembles in the realm of experimental and improvised music, such as the Ensemble Phoenix Basel http://ensemble-phoenix.ch/en/ of which he was a co- founder. He had been a core-member and solo-percussionist since its foundation in 1998. Other important acts are: CORTEX (with the composer, saxophone player and electronic-musician Alex Buess),16-17, Buggatronic (with James Hullick), HOW2 (with the percussionist Daniel Stalder), B&B; (with the flautist Christoph B√∂sch), MIR (with Papiro and Michael Zaugg) and NoiseZone (with Artur and Sebastian Smolyn) His collaborations include artists like Zbigniew Karkowski, Alex Buess, Hany Bedair, Kasper T.Toeplitz, John Duncan, J√ºrg Henneberger, Michael Wertm√ºller, Phill Niblock, Knut Remond, Z'EV, Julio Estrada, Antoine Chessex, Christoph B√∂sch, Volker Heyn, Thomas Lauck, Tim Hodgkinson, Marco Papiro, Iancu Dumitrescu, Ana Maria Avram, Jerome Noetinger, Cadlag and many others. His drumming could be described as highly intense and energetic, archaic but nevertheless sophisticated and multitimbral: he tended to use electronic percussion devices as well as acoustic drums and percussion instruments. Daniel made an extensive use of his self-built percussion devices such as electronic metal shakers, percussive string instruments or electronically modified skin instruments. On his regular tours through Europe, Asia and Australia, he performed at the most highly recognized festivals for experimental music such as Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival (2015), Lucerne Festival, Warsaw Autumn (2006), as well as at several underground- places, open spaces and independent venues. In 2010 he organized the Echo Festival in Belgrade which was documented by a book as well as a CD.http://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~marica/UMNAweb/ECHOweb/echoKATALOGsveMala.pdf In November 2011 he curated and organized the very successful event TERRAINS: JOLT Swiss Australian Sonic Festival The live recordings of this festival have also been published on CD and vinyl.http://atreeinafieldrecords.com/releases/jolt-festival-basel-live- compilation/ In 2014, he released a solo album called \\"Pitch\\", dedicated to Zbigniew Karkowski at Pharmafabrik Recordings.http://www.danielbuess.com/860 Buess died in early 2016, in his home town of Basel.Obituary - Praxis Records  Discography (selection)  * HOW2 Turing Machine (1998), percussion duo Daniel Buess and Daniel Stalder (1998).

The Campaign for Oxford has been a pioneer of university fundraising, in terms of both methods and ambition, since its launch in 1988. It is the biggest and most ambitious fundraising campaign for Higher Education in Europe and one of the largest university fundraising campaigns in the world. Oxford University's campaigns are managed by Oxford University Development Office. This is a permanent office of the University, though the Campaign itself is temporary. Every few years a new campaign is announced and a new target set. History =The decision to fundraise centrally= Oxford University has a long history of philanthropy over the centuries, but like most British universities did not have a systematic approach to obtaining this through a central fundraising office. In the early 1980s, the university sector as a whole was facing a growing financial crisis as public funding was no longer adequate to meet its needs. Fundraising was one of several responses discussed by the Conference of University Administrators. University fundraising was highly controversial. In the Oxford context, it entailed a significant expansion of the central university. Oxford University was traditionally a federation of colleges, and the central administration was originally viewed simply as a range of support functions for the colleges. Various pressures were enhancing the power of the central University, and it was a situation that made the heads of college uncomfortable. It was also not clear that alumni would feel an allegiance to Oxford University as opposed to their own colleges, and there was concern that a central appeal would detract from the much smaller appeals run by some of the poorer colleges. Across the sector as a whole there was a considerable amount of distaste for fundraising. British universities had hitherto relied on government funding and research grants, but public funding was diminishing and universities found themselves increasingly unable to afford to refill vacant posts. Even so, there were differing opinions as to whether fundraising was an appropriate activity, as opposed to lobbying for public funding to be increased. There were questions over potential diversion of funds from 'real' charities, possible donor interference in academic impartiality, and the diversion of academic time from its prime purpose. There was also a significant financial risk for Oxford. The new Development Office represented a huge investment at a time of austerity, which was often expressed in terms of the opportunity cost of funding academic posts. The promised return on this investment was by far the largest goal of any British university campaign at that time ‚Äì most thought in terms of thousands of pounds rather than millions ‚Äì and there was some uncertainty over whether it was possible to raise such a large sum from a standing start. It was increasingly clear, though, that Oxford was facing a financial crisis so severe that its position as a major university was under threat. In the face of cuts to public funding for the university sector it had already left around 90 academic posts unfilled, while investment in infrastructure had virtually ceased. Drastic action was called for if Oxford was to survive as one of the world's leading universities. Responsibility for convincing a reluctant and risk-averse university to undertake this new strategy lay largely with Sir Patrick Neill, subsequently Baron Neill of Bladen. As Vice-Chancellor Elect from 1983 to 1985, and Vice- Chancellor from 1985 to 1989, he recognised that dramatic intervention was the only way of saving the University. He persuaded the University to commission a report from the American consultancy firm, McKinsey, led by Nicholas Ulanov. This not only looked at the feasibility of fundraising, but also recommended methods by which it might be achieved. One of the consultants involved was the future Conservative Party leader, William Hague. =1988‚Äì94 The first Campaign for Oxford= In 1988, Oxford took the unprecedented step of launching its first major fundraising campaign of the modern era. Known simply as The Campaign for Oxford, it was set the then immensely ambitious target of raising ¬£220m in five years, to include research grants and contracts. This required a multimillion-pound investment not only in a major office in Oxford, but also in permanent offices in New York and Tokyo. These were enhanced by the donation of a further office in Toronto. Dr Henry Drucker, a former senior lecturer in politics at the University of Edinburgh and director of its development committee, was recruited to lead the new office. Drucker, an American, brought an understanding of university fundraising from his undergraduate days in the United States. Together with his team, he drew on the McKinsey Report and work done at universities such as Princeton and Duke to devise a new model for university fundraising in the British context. He eschewed the 'cold' mail-shot techniques then dominant in British fundraising, emphasising the importance of building a relationship with prospects and involving them fully in the projects they funded. Central to this 'relationship fundraising' was the Seven Steps of Solicitation, giving importance to phases such as prospect research, painstaking engagement, and reciprocation. His task was made all the more demanding due to the ongoing scepticism he faced from some quarters of the University. Like any new fundraising office, it took time to gather momentum: it needed to establish relationships with potential donors and convince an alumni body unused to the concept of university fundraising that it was a project they should support. In the event, under Drucker's enthusiastic and determined leadership, the Campaign was so successful that it became clear it would surpass its original target; thus in 1993 it was extended for a year and set the even more ambitious target of ¬£340m, which it achieved in October 1994. It had funded new research centres, buildings and 117 academic posts including 34 professorships. =2008 The second Campaign, Oxford Thinking= The second campaign was launched in 2008 under the title The Oxford Thinking Campaign. Its initial target was set at ¬£1.25bn. It surpassed this in 2012 and the University set a new target of ¬£3bn. In 2015 Oxford announced that it was raising funds at the rate of over ¬£200m a year, the highest in UK higher education. Funds raised through the Campaign support three core priorities: student support; academic posts and programmes; and infrastructure. Impact The most visible impacts of the two campaigns are new buildings, scholarships and posts. A sample of these are listed below. * The Sa√Ød Business School, founded by Wafic Sa√Ød, who has donated ¬£70m. This has subsequently been enhanced by the Thatcher Business Education Centre, opened by The Prince of Wales in 2013 and named by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2014. * The Moritz- Heyman Scholarship Programme, providing support to students at a socio- economic or educational disadvantage. This was created with a ¬£75m gift from the venture capitalist Sir Michael Moritz and his wife, the writer Harriet Heyman. It was the biggest philanthropic gift for undergraduate financial support in European history. * The Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, where more than 600 scientists will use big data research and advances in genomics to transform our understanding of disease. This was funded by ¬£20m from the charitable foundations of Hong Kong entrepreneur, Sir Ka-shing Li. * The Mica and Ahmet Ertegun Graduate Scholarship Programme in the Humanities, endowed by a ¬£26m gift from Mica Ertegun. * The Blavatnik School of Government, founded with a ¬£75m donation from Leonard Blavatnik. * The redevelopment of the Ashmolean Museum Behind the scenes, however, the success of fundraising also had a significant impact on the governance of the University. Power was already shifting from the colleges to the central university, for example due to the need for expensive shared science facilities. A central Campaign meant the Vice-Chancellor could gain new funds independently of the colleges. This was part of a trend that in 2004 led to the appointment of the first Vice-Chancellor to be elected from outside Oxford's academic body in 900 years, Sir John Hood.

These reserves were intended to serve as the homelands for the black population. The report is named for Frederick R. Tomlinson, professor of agricultural economics at the University of Pretoria. Tomlinson chaired the ten-person commission, which was established in 1950. The Tomlinson Report found that the reserves were incapable of containing South Africa's black population without significant state investment. However, Hendrik Verwoerd, Minister of Native Affairs, rejected several recommendations in the report. While both Verwoerd and the Tomlinson Commission believed in \\"separate development\\" for the reserves, Verwoerd did not want to end economic interdependence between the reserves and industries in white-controlled areas. The government would go on to pass legislation to restrict the movement of blacks who lived in the reserves to white-controlled areas.  Background  The South African government established native reserves in the 1913 Natives Land Act as areas designated for black citizens to live in. As a result of the 1913 act, blacks could no longer own land outside of the native reserves. The 1923 Native (Urban Areas) Act authorized local governments to establish residential areas designated for black citizens, leading to the development of low-wage laborer migration to urban areas from the native reserves. While the government had intended to strictly control any limited presence of native laborers in urban areas, by World War II declining conditions had led to an outflow from the native reserves and the number of black urban residents had surpassed the number of white urban residents. In 1948, the National Party, which had campaigned on establishing an apartheid regime, came to power. The newly-elected government began to engage in dialogue over the state of the native reserves and how increased black urbanization affected the apartheid vision. The South African Bureau for Racial Affairs (SABRA), a conservative think tank at Stellenbosch University founded in September 1948, emphasized the need for \\"vertical\\" segregation, a system which would enforce total segregation for blacks from the broader political sphere but allow for political advancement within the native reserves. Verwoerd, who became head of the Native Affairs Department in 1950, stated in a 1948 speech to Parliament both that South Africa was a \\"white man‚Äôs country and that he must remain master here,\\" but that, in the reserves, \\"we are prepared to allow the Natives to be the masters.\\" Verwoerd stated in 1950 his belief in the importance of separate political development for the reserves, stating there was \\"no policy of oppression here, but one of creating a situation which has never existed for the Bantu; namely, that, taking into consideration their languages, traditions, history and different national communities, they may pass through a development of their own.‚Äù Verwoerd did not fully align with SABRA in his views; he belonged to a faction in the National Party that sought to enforce racial segregation to pursue grand apartheid and believed in the principles of vertical segregation, but did not want to negatively impact business interests that depended on black labor by enforcing a complete separation between the black population and the white population. In 1951, the year after the Tomlinson Report was commissioned, the government passed the Bantu Authorities Act. The Bantu Authorities Act abolished the Natives Representative Council and created a new hierarchy for tribal, regional and territorial authorities. Creation and composition In 1950, the Federal Mission Council of the Dutch Reformed Church passed a resolution that called on the government to examine \\"native life,\\" particularly with regards to socioeconomic development in the native reserves. That same year, the government appointed the Commission for the Socioeconomic Development of the Bantu Areas to devise \\"a comprehensive scheme for the rehabilitation of the Native Areas with a view to developing within them a social structure in keeping with the culture of the Native and based upon effective socio-economic planning.\\" The commission was created with support from SABRA and included SABRA members. The commission was composed of 10 members, included four academics (including Tomlinson) and two Afrikaner farmers: * Frederick R. Tomlinson * Chris Prinsloo of the Urban Affairs Section, Native Affairs Department * M. C. de Wet Nel of the Native Affairs Group, Native Affairs Department * C. B. Young, Under-Secretary for the Native Areas, Native Affairs Department * J. H. J. van Rensburg, commander-general for the Ossewabrandwag. * G. J. Badenhorst * C. H. Badenhorst * J. H. R. Bisschop, professor of veterinary science (replacement F. X. Laubscher, who resigned) *J. H. Moolman * F. H. Botha (Secretary) In the process of drafting the report, the commission enlisted research specialists. Contents of the report The Tomlinson Report was presented to the government in October 1954 and ran, in its unabridged form, to 3,755 pages published in 17 volumes. The report included 589 tables and 66 maps. The report stated that the government could pursue either integration or total segregation, and strongly emphasized that the government pursue total segregation by industrializing the reserves to make them \\"economically viable.\\" The report recommended that land additional to the land set aside in the 1936 Land Act be purchased and annexed to the reserves, and that the state develop industries in the reserves to create an additional 300,000 jobs. Even then, the report said, the reserves would only be able to include 15 million of South Africa's projected black population by the year 2000; the commission projected that 6.5 million blacks would be residing in the \\"European Areas.\\" The Report also concluded that the traditional 'tribal' authorities used to rule the reserves were not adequate for industrialized areas. In the report, the commission reiterated their commitment to separate development in the reserves to achieve racial harmony.Summary of the Report of the Commission for the Socio-Economic Development of the Bantu Areas within the Union of South Africa. 1955. One section stated that ‚Äúwelfare should be measured by the standards of the people whose welfare is envisaged,\\" and that Africans ‚Äúshould not be ignored nor treated as inferior, merely because they [scale of values] are different.‚Äù = Funding recommendations = The commission concluded that if the reserves were to support the growing black population the government would need to invest at least ¬£104 million over the following decade to ensure fully diversified economies in the reserves. The commission offered the following prospective allocations for the ¬£104 million: * Agricultural development ‚Äì ¬£33,886,000 ** Soil reclamation ‚Äî ¬£27,400,000 ** Credit facilities ‚Äì ¬£3,000,000 ** Sugar-cane production ‚Äî ¬£370,000 ** Fibre production ‚Äî ¬£116,000 ** Irrigation ‚Äî ¬£3,000,000 * Forestry development ‚Äî ¬£3,000,000 * Mining development ‚Äî ¬£1,000,000 * Manufacturing and tertiary activities ‚Äî ¬£30,000,000 * Urban development ‚Äî ¬£12,000,000 * Transport and other basic facilities ‚Äî ¬£13,000,000 * Health services ‚Äî ¬£5,000,000 * Educational services ‚Äî ¬£3,000,000 * Welfare services ‚Äî ¬£3,600,000 * Total estimated expenditure: ¬£104,486,000 = Development scheme = The commission was critical of existing development efforts within the native reserves, stating that ‚Äúindividually and collectively the existing organisations do not comply with the new requirements set by the development programme. The deplorable conditions which prevail in the Bantu Areas today also testify to their present incapacity to bring about any significant development, and even to prevent deterioration.\\" The commission suggested that the Native Affairs Department undergo a re- organization to better support development progress. Specifically, the commission called for establishing a development council that would advise the Minister of Native Affairs on native reserves by conducting research on trends and needs in the reserves. The commission also called for the creation of a development corporation that would both promote black enterprises in the reserves and create enterprises that would be transferred to black ownership. As part of development activities, the commission stated that Church activities should be seen as integral to the development process. = Policy recommendations = The report offered three major recommendations for the government's economic policies in the reserves. First, the commission advocated for an agricultural rehabilitation scheme. The scheme would separate peasant farmers from workers. In coming to this conclusion, the commission surveyed 111 peasant farmers and stated, based on the results, that ‚Äú¬£56 p.a. is large enough to attract a Bantu to full-time farming in mixed farming and pastoral areas, and to bind him permanently to the land.‚Äù Second, the commission recommended that native reserve land be divided into \\"economic farming units\\" under individual ownership. Third, the commission recommended that the government push for industrialization in the reserves to incorporate those who, as a result of land reform, would become dispossessed. The commission called for investment in \\"European capital\\" and in education, particularly through the previously mentioned development corporation. Reception Verwoerd refused to implement several of the report's recommendations despite accepting the report \\"in principle\\". Verwoerd's objection focused in part on certain items that were allocated funding in the budget, expressing his wish to limit spending at ¬£36.6 million. He rejected the idea of allowing, as the report suggested, white industrialists to enter the reserves; therefore, he stated that funding allocated for the development corporation, which was \\"presumably based upon the principle ... of the admission of large European privately owned industries into the Bantu areas,\\" could be excluded from the budget. Instead of creating a program for \\"white capital\\" to enter the reserves, Verwoerd advocated for establishing ‚Äúborder industries.\\" Verwoerd also argued that the amounts set aside for agricultural development and urban development could be brought down dramatically. Finally, he rejected the idea of eliminating communal ownership of land. Verwoerd stated that the Native Affairs Department would rely on ‚Äúother considered views based upon much wider practical experience of administrative affairs‚Äù to determine proper financial funding for the reserves. Verwoerd's opinions reflected the opinions of others in the National Party who did not want to curb dependence on African labor. Some faculty members from SABRA received the report well, viewing it as evidence that ‚Äúapartheid could and must be made to work.‚Äù Some members of SABRA voiced their displeasure with Verwoerd's refusal to implement most recommendations in the report. J.L. Sadie, a professor at Stellenbosch University, wrote an article in January 1957 for the South African Institute of Race Relations that criticized Verwoerd's decision to not allow for private industry in the reserves. Sadie argued that foreign capitalists had already invested heavily in South Africa without making the country any less \\"South African.\\" Attendees at a June 1956 congress organized by the Dutch Reformed Churches, SABRA and the Federation of Afrikaans Cultural Organizations commended the Tomlinson Commission for its report without directing any criticism at the government. In 1956, more than 400 delegates to the Interdenominational African Ministers' Federation (IAMF) conference in Bloemfontein voted to reject the Tomlinson Report.  Impact  The recommendations of the Tomlinson Report aligned with the government's belief in \\"separate development\\" for whites and blacks. Even though the government did not follow several recommendations in the report, the government still sought to confine blacks to the reserves as much as they could without curtailing dependence on black labor. Parliament passed several pieces of legislation that defined the segregated nature and structure of the reserves in the following years. Under Verwoerd, who became Prime Minister in 1958, the legislature passed the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act of 1959. This act created \\"bantustans,\\" or separate homelands for blacks, that were established based on linguistic and cultural differences. The act intended to develop self-government for the bantustans. In 1970, Parliament passed the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, and in 1971, the legislature passed the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act. The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act designated blacks as citizens of their bantustans, and the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act gave the president the power to create tribal, regional and territories authorities. The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act designated black workers as ‚Äúforeign visitors‚Äù in white areas and led to the government forcibly resettling blacks in the bantustans. The Tomlinson Report had recommended that \\"all-Union Bantu\\" be regarded as foreigners. As the Tomlinson Commission had concluded, the reserves as they existed could not provide economic opportunities for most black residents beyond agriculture; blacks that migrated to the bantustans were concentrated in border areas and commuted into white areas for their jobs. In 1986, the government abolished pass laws and in 1994, the end of apartheid also led to the end of the bantustans.

This is the 161st flight of a Progress spacecraft.  History  The Progress-MS is a uncrewed freighter based on the Progress-M featuring improved avionics. This improved variant first launched on 21 December 2015. It has the following improvements: * New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites. Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers. First time installed on Progress MS-03. * Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism. * Improved Micrometeoroid (MMOD) protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment. * Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations. * GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination. * Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station. * New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations. * The Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V on board radio system and antenna/feeder system has been replaced with a Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS). * Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system. Launch Progress MS-09 launched on 9 July 2018 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. It used a Soyuz-2.1a rocket. NASA confirmed on 28 June 2018 that if Progress MS-09 launches on 9 July 2018, the mission succeeded a super fast-tracked rendezvous with the Station, docking to the ISS just 3 hours (2 orbits) after launch - making it the fastest orbital rendezvous ever-attempted with the Station. Docking Progress MS-09 docked as scheduled with the nadir docking port of the Pirs module on 10 July 2018 at 01:31 UTC. The new version features the upgraded Kurs-NA rendezvous system, featuring the AO-753A antenna replaced the earlier 2AO-VKA antenna and three AKR-VKA antennas, while two older 2ASF-M-VKA antennas are retained. Kurs-NA will increase the reliability and safety during docking operations. The new SUD flight control system allows for autonomous trajectory measurements using the GLONASS (Uragan) navigation satellites. The communications system is also upgraded to use the Luch-5 data relay satellites. Also improvements were made to the micrometeoroid protection, the lighting system and the docking port.  Cargo  The Progress MS-09 spacecraft delivered 2,450 kg of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station. The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: * Dry cargo: 1,275 kg * Fuel: 705 kg * Oxygen and Air: 50 kg * Water: 420 kg Cubesats Beginning with the Progress MS-03, the Progress can optionally carry four CubeSat deployers for a total of 24 CubeSat-units. Undocking and decay Undocking occurred on 25 January 2019, at 12:55 UTC. Later that day, the spacecraft burned up in the atmosphere and its debris fell into the Pacific Ocean.

It depicts a group of flying men in green coats and hats playing ice hockey among large ice cubes. The painting is owned by a private collector in Pennsylvania. Description Four men dressed in green coats are engaged in a team sport with ice hockey sticks. Two of the men, wearing feathered tyrolean hats, hover above the ice. A third man has fallen and dropped his stick. The fourth man is stuck inside one of three large ice cubes on the ice. From another ice cube, a green maggot or slug is emerging. To the left is a grey stone and concrete building with metal details. To the right is a yellow barrack with a white roof and gable wall, and two crossed planks across the door. In the upper right corner is a green and white sign with a white symbol identical to the algiz rune. In the background is a barren landscape with patches of snow. Reception Alexi Worth of Artforum speculated whether the slug is what the players are chasing, or if it is \\"in fact a metamorphosed teammate\\". Worth wrote that \\"Rauch delights in such teasing narrative cues, and he delivers them with a beguiling stylization.\\" He commented the painting's \\"skittering highlights\\" and wrote that it is \\"as though the whole tableau has been coated in some kind of spray-on rainproofing.\\" Valerie Nantel wrote in the Concordia Undergraduate Journal of Art History: \\"The desolate landscape and other elements suggest an immediate connection to Surrealist works. The dreamy quality of fading seems to pull towards the idea of the subconscious.\\" Nantel wrote that the \\"passivity and detachment of the figures within the work disturb us as emotional beings\\", and that this \\"detachment is accentuated by the method in which the figures are rendered. They almost look as if they were stuck on to the canvas.\\" References External links * Hunt at the David Zwirner Gallery's website 2002 paintings Paintings by Neo Rauch Sports paintings Ice hockey culture ","title":"Hunt (painting)"},{"id":"51104272","text":"A Bristol Bullet and a Bristol 405 Drophead coup√© on display at Salon Priv√©.Rear view of the Bristol Bullet on display at Salon Priv√©.

It was founded in 1919 as a successor to the Equal Suffrage League, a campaign for women's suffrage in the state, and appointed Edna Gellhorn as its first president. It is affiliated to the U.S.-wide League of Women Voters and organizes local branches in different parts of the state.  History  The Missouri League of Women Voters was organized at the Golden Jubilee Convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in St. Louis, Missouri in March, 1919. Missouri had just passed a bill allowing women to vote, but the Equal Suffrage League was initially not allowed to change its name to reflect the new legislation. Later, the National President of the League of Women Voters, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, called a state convention and allowed the League to change its name. On October 16, 17, and 18, 1919, the Missouri Suffrage Association held a convention and the old League became the Missouri League of Women Voters. At the convention, 122 delegates from active Missouri suffrage leagues were present and the Statler Hotel ballroom was filled to capacity. A new constitution, written by Miss Laura Runyon of Warrensburg, Miss Myrtle Wood of St. Louis, and Mrs. Elmer McKay of Springfield, was adopted. Article II of the constitution read \\" The aims of this League shall be to increase the effectiveness of women's vote in furthering better government. The League, as an organization, shall be strictly non-partisan. Its officers and members are free to join the party of their choice.\\" Initially, both major political parties were suspicious of the League of Women Voters, as they were worried it would interfere with their own plans for organizing women. Edna Gellhorn was the first president of the Missouri League of Women Voters. She held classes for first time voters across Missouri, often traveling in the caboose of a milk train. She served as president of the St. Louis League of Women Voters three times and served on the national board.  Policies  At the time of its founding, the Missouri League of Women Voters were described as a group of enfranchised women who want not just to vote, but to vote for something. As women were given the right to vote in 1919, suffragists turned their attention from the effort to secure the vote towards using their vote to build a better world. Members were identified as political, but not partisan. LWV Missouri encourages informed and active participation in government. The organization is nonpartisan and does not endorse or oppose any political party or candidate. LWV educates voters, encourages citizens to register to vote, and communicates policy priorities to government officials. They also provide training on voting procedures, candidate, issues, lobbying, and campaigning. In order to project a nonpartisan stance, visible leaders of LWV refrain from political activity, partisan support, or running for office.

Since 1993, most of the region has been protected by the Black Mountain Nature Reserve (Naturschutzgebiet Schwarze Berge), the second largest in Bavaria outside of the Alps, in order to counteract its afforestation by coniferous forest.Information about nature conservation, retrieved 12 October 2013  Natural region grouping  The name Schwarze Berge was defined as a natural region in 1968 as part of the natural regional classification of Germany in the 1960s at a scale of 1:200,000 (Sheet 140 Schweinfurt) and grouped as follows:Brigitte Schwenzer: Geographische Landesaufnahme: The Natural Region Units on Sheet 140, Schweinfurt - Bundesanstalt f√ºr Landeskunde, Bad Godesberg, 1968 ‚Üí online map (pdf, 4 MB) *(part of 35 East Hesse Highlands) **(part of 354 High Rh√∂n) ***(part of 354.0 Southern High Rh√∂n) ****354.01 Black Mountains (Schwarze Berge)  Boundaries  In the north is the municipality of Wildflecken. From there the natural region's boundary with the Kreuzberg Group runs east-southeast along the valley between the Feuerberg and Kreuzberg in order finally to follow the Kellersbach after the Guckas Pass. North of Langenleiten the boundary runs southwards in order to leave the valleys of the tributaries of the Kleiner Steinach. Continuing westwards, the boundary of the natural region runs through the villages of Platz and Geroda. Between the Kellersbach and Geroda the Black Mountains border on the Adelsberg Forest, part of the Schondra- Thulba-South Rh√∂n, which in turn is part of the Hammelburg South Rh√∂n. The latter is part of the South Rh√∂n which in turn belongs to the major natural region unit of Odenwald, Spessart and South Rh√∂n, which is part of the South German Scarplands and not the Central Uplands. The natural regional boundary with the Br√ºckenau Kuppenrh√∂n, which is part of the Kuppenrh√∂n, follow the Milzbach as it flows north past Schildeck. After its confluence with the Sinn the boundary follows the river downstream heading northwards. North of Oberbach the region is bounded by the Dammersfeld Ridge to the west as far as Wildflecken.  Geology  Geology of the Southern High Rh√∂n As well as the Black Mountains, the Southern High Rh√∂n also includes the Kreuzberg Group and the Dammersfeld Ridge. All three mountain ridges consist of a basalt shield, which is occasionally intruded, and thus are different from Long Rh√∂n and, to a lesser extent, the Wasserkuppenrh√∂n, even if they clearly differ from the individual summits of the Kuppenrh√∂n (see adjacent map). In terms of its rock composition, the region compares to the Kreuzberg Group. The Black Mountains consist of two mountain ridges, which are formed of individual domed summits or kuppen. The basement is formed of red clays and marls overlaid by rocks of the Lower Muschelkalk. The summits are mostly composed of basalt. In most places the rock s covered by a layer of loam soil.

In addition to Kulikbayev, police arrested five other suspects involved in the attack, while officers shot and killed a sixth suspect. While in custody, Kulikbayev confessed to the attack after being arrested, claiming he perpetrated it due to a hatred of law enforcement. In November 2016, Kulikbayev was convicted of terrorism and murder charges stemming from the attack, and was sentenced to death. He remains the only person on Kazakhstan's death row. Kulikbayev's five accomplices were also convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 3 to 10.5 years.  Background  The attack came less than a month after the 2016 Aktobe shootings where 25 people were killed.  Prelude to the attack  At 3:52 AM local time Ruslan Kulikbayev, armed with a handgun, committed his first murder by shooting an alleged Uzbek prostitute in a taxicab. He then forced the taxi driver to drive him to Almaty.  Attack  Kulikbayev originally intended to begin his attack at an Almaty courthouse, but changed his mind upon seeing the large number of civilians there, and instead forced the taxi driver to bring him to an Almaty Police Station. Near the station, Kulikbayev released the taxi driver unharmed and walked the remaining distance to his target. The taxi driver was later apprehended by authorities after the shootings in Almaty, but police released the driver after they determined he was not an accomplice of Kulikbayev. At around 11:00 am local time, Kulikbayev, armed with an MCM semi-automatic handgun, shot and killed a policeman outside of the Almaty Police Station and stole his weapon, an automatic AKS-74U assault rifle. Kulikbayev then began firing the assault rifle indiscriminately at nearby police officers and civilians. After shooting several people, Kulikbayev carjacked a vehicle, shooting and killing its driver. A female driver recorded the shooting on a dashboard camera, but Kulikbayev did not shoot her. Using the stolen car, Kulikbayev drove to a nearby Kazakh government building housing offices of the NSC, where he shot and wounded another policeman and an NSC official. The wounded NSC official later died from his wounds at the hospital, although the injured police officer survived. After shooting the two officers, Kulikbayev hijacked a second car, but was spotted and chased by responding police vehicles as he tried to flee. After a high-speed chase, police eventually cornered Kulikbayev, where he engaged the officers in a violent gunfight. During the shootout, several more policemen were wounded, and three officers would later die from their injuries in the hospital. Kulikbayev finally surrendered to authorities after being shot five times. Kulikbayev was taken to a nearby hospital where he was treated for gunshot wounds. While in the hospital, he was interrogated by investigators and confessed to the Almaty attacks and the previous murder of the Uzbek prostitute. During his interrogation, Kulikbayev claimed he had only intended to kill police in the shootings, and not civilians. Owing to conflicting reports regarding the number of casualties and confusion over the number, location, and identities of the suspects, police were \\"sluggish\\" in responding to the incident. Almaty was placed on lockdown after the incident and SWAT teams, anti-terrorist units and soldiers patrolled the area for several hours, searching for suspects. In addition to the police shootings committed by Kulikbayev, at least two other individuals linked to Kulikbayev carried out separate attacks in and around Almaty on the same day. One of the attackers was killed in a shootout with police, while the other was arrested. In the days following the Almaty shootings, Kazakh police arrested and charged four more individuals with suspected connections to the shootings. =Victims= In total, the attacks in Almaty killed at least 10 people and wounded over a dozen others. The dead included an Uzbek prostitute killed by Kulikbayev the night before the attack, four police officers and one civilian killed during the attack, and three injured policemen who later died from their wounds in the hospital. Four of the police officers killed by Kulikbayev were identified as: * Captain Bauyrzhan Nurmakhanbetov, 28, who had been serving in the Department of internal Affairs since 22 December 2011. * Junior Sergeant Maksat Salimbaev, 24, who had been serving in the Department of internal Affairs since 15 November 2013. * Starshina Ayan Galiev, 42, who had been serving in the Department of internal Affairs since 30 January 1997. * Lieutenant Timur Begasilov, 29, who had been serving in the Department of internal Affairs since January. 2015. Died of wounds in hospital the next day. = Perpetrator = Ruslan Alpysbayuly Kulikbayev () was the main perpetrator and mastermind of the attack. He was convicted of terrorism and murder in November, 2016, and sentenced to death. He is the only person in Kazakhstan on death row. Kulikbayev was born on 11 June 1990 in Baikonur and raised there. His parents had divorced when he was still a minor. He attended Yuri Gagarin Comprehensive Secondary School No. 8, leaving after the 9th grade with an incomplete secondary school certificate. In school days he was reportedly introverted and prone to violence under the influence of alcohol. Kulikbayev had been convicted twice previously. The first time, a 3-year suspended imprisonment for robbery with violence imposed on him by the Enbekshi District Court of Shymkent on 27 August 2010. It was determined that he ambushed a jewelry saleswoman near her home in July 2010, beating her and taking away her purse with 115,000 tenge (‚âàUS$5,500) and a mobile phone. The second time, the police seized a Nagant M1895 with ammunition and a suppressor from him, presumedly found by Kulikbayev near a local railway station of Taraz on 14 February 2012, that led to his 3-year and 6-month prison sentence for illegal acquisition and possession of firearms enhanced by recidivism by the Kyzylorda Municipal Court on 8 May 2012. In prison, 14 penalties were imposed on him for disobedience and violation of orders and instructions provided by detention personnel. According to security officials, he maintained close relations with Salafists while being incarcerated. His marriage to Ayaylym Umbetkulova, a native of Yntymak, Ile District began in the early 2010s and produced a son and a daughter. By the words of his wife, he turned from an exemplary family man to a deeply religious person after the release, and wanted her to wear hijab, but she refused. In recent times, he resided in Yntymak, and worked odd jobs for a living, such as selling mobile phones.  Response  * : Head of the Chechen Republic, a federal subject of Russia, Ramzan Kadyrov offered on his Instagram page condolences to the brotherly people of Kazakhstan and President Nursultan Nazarbayev, and confirmed Chechnya's readiness to closely cooperate with Kazakhstan in fighting terrorism. * : Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi strongly condemned the attack, and stated \\"Terror and violence in any form and anywhere are condemned and unacceptable\\".  Investigation  During their investigation, the police found that Kulikbayev had killed an Uzbek woman the night before the attack. Kulikbayev had originally planned to kill judges and prosecutors at the Almaly District Court to get revenge on law enforcement structures for his previous imprisonment, as reported by Minister of Internal Affairs Kalmukhanbet Kassymov.  Trial and sentencing  Kulikbayev, along with five other individuals, were charged by a Kazakh court in Almaty with numerous crimes including murder, attempted murder, and terrorism stemming from the attack. In an extremely rare move, the government prosecutors announced that they were seeking the death penalty for Kulikbayev. Although Kazakhstan officially abolished the death penalty for civil crimes in 2007, it still allows capital punishment for crimes committed under \\"exceptional circumstances\\", such as war crimes or, (as Kulikbayev was charged with), acts of terrorism. No executions have been carried out in Kazakhstan since 2003 due to a moratorium, but the penalty can still be imposed on certain criminals. During the trial proceedings, Kulikbayev was reportedly very belligerent and uncooperative, at one point allegedly flipping over and \\"tossing\\" a table at an investigator despite being handcuffed. On November 2, 2016, the Kazakh court found all six defendants guilty of their involvement in the Almaty attack. In addition to murder, and attempted murder, Kulikbayev was convicted of terrorism (a capital offense) and sentenced to death, becoming the first person in Kazakhstan to receive such a sentence in nearly ten years. Kulikbayev currently awaits execution on death row in Black Berkut Prison in Kostanay Region. He is the only person in Kazakhstan currently under a sentence of death. Kulikbayev's lawyer stated that there are no plans to appeal the verdict. Kazakh PM stated after the verdict that, although he considered Kulikbayev's sentence \\"fair\\", he did not believe that Kulikbayev would ever be executed, as Kazakhstan has instituted a moratorium on the death penalty since 2003. Kulikbayev has attempted suicide at least twice while incarcerated. The attorneys for the other five defendants tried to argue that their clients had little or no involvement in the attacks, but the argument was rejected and the five defendants were convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 3 to 10.5 years.

It is a concept album with a narrative about seal-like beast and her human partner questing through the Mesozoic Era, which was adapted from the fictional document \\"Blood Ark\\". The album's title also alludes to Roman goddess Ceres and Greek goddess Calypso.

Encompassing more than of woodlands and pasture, the farm has 150 years of architectural history, include a rare 18th-century English barn. Originally a subsistence farm, it became a gentleman's farm in the late 19th century, and its farmstead now hosts a regional government commission. The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The former King Farm is located about west of Woodstock village, to the north of United States Route 4 and Rose Hill, a loop road on US 4's north side. The farm consists of , roughly divided equally between cleared and forested land; the cleared land is used either as pasturage or haying. The farmstead is located at the end of King Farm Road, once a through road leading to Barnard but now serving as the farmstead's drive. The complex includes the main house and barn, as well as a sheep barn, horse shed, granary, and workshop, most of which were built before 1900. The main house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, built about 1793 and enlarged twice during the 19th century. The main barn's oldest portion dates to the same period, consisting of an English barn that has been nearly completely enclosed by additions. The sheep barn, added to the property in 1840, is 1-1/2 stories in height with a shed roof extension on one side. with The farm was cleared and first settled by Jesse Williams, progenitor of a locally prominent family, in the early 1790s, and farmed by him until 1807. Jabez King, a Massachusetts native who had lived in Woodstock for 20 years, purchased the farm from Williams, and four generations of his family would work the land. The farmstead is not only significant for the survival of some of its oldest buildings, but also for the diversity of structures, exemplifying the changes in agricultural and architectural trends. Hiram Udall King, a grandson who made is name in education (founding the King School in Stamford, Connecticut), bought out shares of his siblings and mother in the farm in 1887, transforming it into gentleman's farm and summer retreat. In the early 20th century he added additional living quarters for hands hired to work the land, and added buildings for use by its summer residents and visitors. In 1985, the last of King's descendants died, leaving the remaining land to what is now the Vermont Land Trust.

The Nvidia Shield version of GeForce Now, formerly known as NVIDIA GRID, launched in Beta in 2013, with Nvidia officially unveiling its name on September 30, 2015. The subscription service provided users with unlimited access to a library of games hosted on Nvidia servers for the life of the subscription, being delivered to subscribers through streaming video. Certain titles were also available via a \\"Buy & Play\\" model. This version was discontinued in 2019, and transitioned to a new version of the service that enabled Shield users to play their own games. In January 2017, Nvidia unveiled GeForce Now clients for Windows and Macintosh computers, available in North America and Europe as a free beta. GeForce Now lets users access a virtual computer, where they can install their existing games from existing digital distribution platforms, and play them remotely. As with the original Shield version, the virtual desktop is also streamed from Nvidia servers. An Android client was also introduced in 2019. The service exited Beta and launched to the general public on February 4, 2020. It is available on Windows, macOS, Android, Shield TV, and Chromebook devices.  Features  GeForce Now consists of a network of servers based in data centers in North America and Europe, that host and serve the GeForce Now game library to members in those regions. The servers utilize Nvidia Tesla graphics cards, and can stream games at up to 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second (sometimes even 120 frames). Nvidia recommended a 50 Mbit/s internet connection for the 1080/60p stream, but the service can also stream at 720p/60p for 25 Mbit/s connections, 720/30p frames per second for connections higher than 10 Mbit/s, and use adaptive bitrate streaming to scale the quality based on bandwidth. The server-side hardware will be upgraded over time to improve the quality of the streams.  Library  The original GeForce Now library on Shield contained over 80 games as of March 2016; at the Game Developers Conference 2016, Nvidia announced new licensing deals with Sega and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. A large amount of the service's library was available for streaming with a subscription. Some games were available as a \\"Buy & Play\\" title only, under which users have to purchase the title in order to access it. This library has since been replaced with a \\"bring your own games\\" model, which is consistent with GeForce Now for Windows, Macintosh, and Android. For example, if a user wants to play Fortnite on a device, it would be free as the game itself is free to play, but to play Grand Theft Auto V, the user would need to sign into a Steam account that owns that game. Nvidia has been involved in a number of licensing rights disputes related to games on the service, especially in February and March 2020 when the service transitioned from its beta stage to its general release. Activision Blizzard pulled all their games from the service in February 2020, citing a \\"misunderstanding\\" on the terms.https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/12/21135296/geforce-now-activision- blizzard-games-nvidia- streaminghttps://www.polygon.com/2020/2/15/21138927/geforce-now-activision- games-pulled-blizzard-nvidia-reason Bethesda pulled the majority of its games shortly afterward.https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/21/21147821/nvidia-geforce- now-list-of-games-fallout-skyrim-bethesda-softworks-pulled The developers of The Long Dark said that their game was improperly placed on the service without any sort of licensing agreement; Nvidia agreed to remove that game as well.https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/2/21161372/nvidia-geforce-now-the-long- dark-removed In the beginning of March 2020, 2K Games also pulled their products from the service. NVidia announced in May 2020 that they would change their approach to have developers and publishers require their games to be opted into use for the library on the GeForce Now service, starting in June 2020, though this will be a free service offered to these companies. Shortly afterwards, Valve announced that it was launching a beta of its Steam Cloud Play services for its storefront that would integrate with other cloud gaming services, including GeForce Now.  GeForce Now for computers  At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2017, Nvidia announced a version of GeForce Now for Windows and Macintosh computers. Unlike the version for Nvidia Shield (which Nvidia promoted as being similar to Netflix), this is a separate offering in which users can rent access to a remote desktop with access to a Windows environment with GeForce GTX graphics. Users can install digital distribution clients such as Steam onto the remote desktop to download and run purchased or free-to-play games as they would locally. One potential pricing structure is per-minute of play time using blocks of service credits; two price tiers would be available, with GTX 1060 and GTX 1080-class performance respectively. Nvidia aimed this service towards users who want to play their own purchased games on computers that are not compatible with them, such as laptops and computers with low-end capabilities. This pricing structure was never introduced. Instead, Nvidia revealed two membership options ‚Äì Free and Founder's ‚Äì on February 4, 2020, when GeForce Now officially ended its beta period. Nvidia announced a planned beta of the service in March 2017, but it was silently cancelled. In an earnings report in May 2017, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang revealed that a beta would be held \\"sometime soon\\", but that the company was \\"still years away from being able to find the right balance between cost and quality of service and the pervasiveness of virtualizing a gaming PC.\\" In late October 2017, Nvidia launched a free and open beta of the service limited to the Macintosh platform for English users in North America and Europe. In January 2018, Nvidia added PCs to the GeForce Now service, and, on February 4, 2020, the service was launched to the general public with generally positive reviews compared to rival streaming service Google Stadia.

It was the eight-day defence of a fortified outbuilding, occupied by a combination of 18 civilians and 50 members of the Bengal Military Police Battalion, against 2,500‚Äì3,000 mutinying Bengal Native Infantry sepoys from three regiments and an estimated 8,000 men from irregular forces commanded by Kunwar Singh, the local zamindar or chieftain who controlled the Jagdishpur estate. An attempt to break the siege failed, with around 290 casualties out of around 415 men in the relief party. Shortly afterwards, a second relief effort consisting of 225 men and three artillery guns‚Äîcarried out despite specific orders that it should not take place‚Äîdispersed the forces surrounding the building, suffering two casualties, and the besieged party escaped. Only one member of the besieged group was injured. Background On 10 May 1857, a mutiny by the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry, a Bengal Army unit stationed in Meerut, triggered the Indian Mutiny, which quickly spread through the Bengal Presidency. The town of Arrah, headquarters of Shahabad district, besides its local inhabitants, had a population at the time that included British and European employees of the East India Company and the East Indian Railway Company, and their respective families. In addition, there was a local police force and a jail holding between 200 and 400 inmates, with 150 armed prison guards. The population also included many sepoys from disbanded regiments and retired sepoys living on their pensions. Stationed in Danapur, away, were two regiments of the British Army and three regiments of the East India Company's Bengal Native Infantry (part of the infantry component of the Bengal Army)‚Äîthe 7th, 8th and 40th Regiments. At the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny these were the only \\"native\\" troops in Shahabad district. They had been recruited entirely from Shahabad district and were loyal to the local zamindar (chieftain or landlord) Kunwar Singh (also known as Koor, Coer, Koer, Koowar, or Kooer Sing). Singh, who was around 80years of age, had a number of grievances against the East India Company regarding deprivation of his lands and income, and was described as \\"the high-souled chief of a warlike tribe, who had been reduced to a nonentity by the yoke of a foreign invader\\" by George Trevelyan in his 1864 book The Competition Wallah. On 8 June, a letter arrived from William Tayler, the commissioner of Patna district, warning that an outbreak of mutiny from the Bengal Native Infantry units in Dinapore was to be expected. The European population in Arrah spent that night at the house of Arthur Littledale, a judge working in Arrah, and during the night it was decided that the European women and children were to be sent by boat to Dinapore, escorted by armed members of the European male population, where they would be taken into the care of the 10th Regiment of Foot‚Äîthis decision was acted upon on the 9th. The following morning a meeting was held at the house of Herwald Wake, the magistrate of Shahabad district, to discuss what to do next. The East India Company civil servants stated that they did not intend to abandon the town and they would remain. All but two of the remaining European male residents of Arrah who were not civil servants or Government employees decided to leave for the relative safety of Dinapore by boat or on horseback and did so the same day. This reduced the European male population of Arrah to eight, rising to sixteen over the next few weeks as men arrived in the town from the surrounding district. The defence of the town was augmented on 11 June when a party arrived consisting of 50 sepoys and 6 sowars from the Bengal Military Police Battalion, known as Rattray's Sikhs (now the 3rd Battalion of the Sikh Regiment, Indian Army), under the command of Jemadar Hooken Singh. The party had been sent from Dinapore, part of a larger detachment under their commander Captain Rattray whose presence in the area had been personally requested by Tayler, and placed under the direct command of Wake. Following a suggestion from Wake, Richard Vicars Boyle, District Engineer with the East Indian Railway Company, began to fortify his two-storey, outbuilding (originally intended as a billiard room) and completed his work by 17 June. The arches of the verandah were filled in with bricks without mortar, leaving small holes in the walls for defenders to shoot through. Gaps between pillars on the second storey were filled with bricks and sandbags. Boyle stored food, water, wine and beer in the building in anticipation of unrest in the town. Although it was suggested that the civil servants should immediately move their headquarters to Boyle's building, the suggestion was dismissed due to objections to its location, the close proximity of trees, outbuildings and other houses and the possibility that abandoning their current headquarters would lead to disorder in the town. Throughout June and July, news arrived in Arrah about the widespread rebellion throughout the Bengal Presidency and there were rumours that outbreaks would take place within Shahabad district imminently, leading to the decision by the civil servants to mount nightly armed patrols. On 17 July, an anonymous note was found on a table in Littledale's house saying that a mutiny of sepoys was \\"certain to take place\\" on 25 July; according to the note, Kunwar Singh was directly involved. News arrived in the town on 22 July concerning the massacres that had taken place during the Siege of Cawnpore. Then on 25 July a letter arrived from Dinapore by express post, stating: \\"A revolt among the native troops is expected to occur this day. Stand prepared accordingly.\\" Battle =The siege= 200px Around east of Arrah, the 7th, 8th and 40th Regiments of Bengal Native Infantry were stationed in Dinapore, alongside the British Army's 10th and 37th Regiments of Foot. Throughout June, Tayler received anonymous letters warning him about the conduct of the sepoys, and he was informed that large sums of money were being distributed to the sepoys for unknown reasons. Tayler also ordered the interception of all mail being sent to and from the three regiments, leading to the discovery of plotters within Dinapore and nearby Patna who were then jailed. Discussions had taken place between Tayler and his superiors about disarming the three regiments of Bengal Native Infantry stationed in Dinapore, and Governor-General Charles Canning delegated responsibility for the decision to Major General George Lloyd, military commander of the Dinapore division. Instead of disarming the regiments, on the morning of 25 July Lloyd ordered the sepoys to hand in their percussion caps at 4:00pm that day. The 7th and 8th Regiments refused and fired on their officers. The 10th and 37th Regiments of Foot, also stationed in Dinapore, then opened fire on the mutineers. The 40th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, who had begun to comply with Lloyd's order, were also fired on in the confusion. All three regiments of Bengal Native Infantry then left Dinapore heading toward Arrah. At the outbreak of the disturbance, Lloyd could not be located; by the time he was found aboard a river steamboat and orders were given to apprehend the mutineers, they were too far away to be caught. Lloyd, believing that his forces should remain in place to defend Dinapore, refused to order the pursuit of the mutineers. On the evening of 25 July, information arrived at Arrah that a disturbance was to be expected in the district. Wake had been told by a railway engineer stationed nearby that the boats used to cross the Son River would be destroyed; when Wake was informed on the morning of the 26th that the mutineers were crossing the river, he realised that the boats had in fact not been destroyed as promised. Wake, who had no information about the number of mutinying sepoys and other forces approaching Arrah, noted that the local police force had disappeared and he decided not to abandon the town. Eighteen civilians and fifty members of the Bengal Military Police Battalion moved into Boyle's fortified building and bricked themselves up inside. The building had stores of food, drink and ammunition (with gunpowder and lead to make more if required), entrenching tools and weapons the men had brought with them. The supplies were thought to be sufficient for a few days and, since they expected the mutineers to be followed by pursuing forces, the men anticipated a brief siege of no more than 48 hours. Throughout the entire siege Wake kept a diary by writing on the walls of the building so there would be a record of events if the besieged party did not survive. On the morning of 27 July the mutineers, joined by Kunwar Singh and his forces, arrived in Arrah. They released the prisoners from the jail and, joined by its guards, looted the treasury of 85,000 rupees. The mutineers and rebels (including the prison guards) then surrounded the house with drums and bugles playing, arranged themselves into formation and charged. When the mutineers were within 100 yards the men inside opened fire on them, killing eighteen instantly and forcing the rest to stop their charge and take shelter behind the surrounding trees and buildings. 300px Over the following seven days the besieged party faced constant musket fire, with fire from two artillery pieces after 28 July. When the party began to run out of water on 29 July, sepoys sneaked out of the building during the night, stole tools from their opponents and dug an well in about 12 hours. When food began to run out, a small group was able to sneak out of the building on the afternoon of 30 July and return with some sheep that had been grazing within the compound. Although an attempt was made to smoke the men out of the house by making a large fire of furniture and chilli peppers, a last-minute shift in wind direction blew the smoke away from the house. Every evening, a voice loudly invited the Sikh sepoys in the house to slaughter the Europeans and join the mutineers, offering them 500 rupees each; it was met at first with sarcasm, and later by gunfire from the building. The mutineers and rebel forces did not attempt another charge on the building, although its occupants expected an attack at any moment during the siege. =First relief attempt= 300px News reached Dinapore on 27 July that mutinying sepoys had attacked Arrah. General Lloyd was still unwilling to send troops to pursue the mutineers until he was persuaded to do so by pressure from magistrates, who were personal friends of the besieged party, and Tayler in his role as the Commissioner of Patna. A party of 200 from the 37th Regiment of Foot, 50 from the Bengal Military Police Battalion and 15 loyal Sikhs from regiments that had mutinied, were sent, aboard the river steamer Horungotta, to rescue the town's civil servants. News arrived in Dinapore the following day that the steamer was aground on a sandbank, and Lloyd ordered the party recalled. Under pressure from local government officials, he changed his mind and agreed to send, using the river steamer Bombay, a large force of the 10th Regiment of Foot under Lieutenant Colonel William Fenwick to join up with the party on the first steamer and head to Arrah. Bombay already had a large complement of civilian passengers and attempts to have the passengers removed met with confusion and arguments with the captain of the steamer, causing a delay of around four hours. As a result, only a reduced force of about 150 (including seven civilian volunteers) was able to embark. Fenwick, unwilling to carry out the mission with only 150 men, delegated its command to Captain Charles Dunbar (who worked in the paymaster's bureau) and Bombay departed on 29 July at around 9:30am. The two steamers met up, and the combined force of about 415 then headed towards Arrah. 200px The expedition arrived at a place called Beharee Ghat on the western bank of the Son River and disembarked at about 4:00pm. Their path was then blocked by a large stream that could only be crossed using boats. The party took three hours to cross the stream and head inland. After the expedition had marched , Dunbar halted them from Arrah for one hour to see if his supplies would catch up to him. When the supplies did not arrive, he ordered the expedition to press on, despite warnings from his subordinate officers of the danger of hungry, tired men marching through unfamiliar territory at night. Up to this point in the expedition, Dunbar had sent skirmishers as scouts ahead of his main body of troops; he now decided not to do so and the men advanced in a single body. As the party neared Arrah, they spotted men on horseback, whom they took to be vedettes (mounted sentries), that rode away as they approached. When the expedition was about from Arrah, its route passed through a thick grove of mango trees. As the expedition was almost through the grove, they were fired on from three sides by a force they estimated as 2,000 to 3,000 in number. Heavy casualties were suffered during the initial ambush, including Dunbar (who was killed instantly), and the force broke up in confusion. The besieged party in Arrah heard the sound of gunfire, growing louder as the expedition approached them, then becoming more distant as the expedition retreated, and they immediately inferred that something must have gone wrong. A wounded member of the Bengal Military Police Battalion who was part of Dunbar's force was able to avoid the mutinying sepoys surrounding Boyle's building. Pulled up into the building with a rope, he told its occupants about the ambush. During the retreat from Arrah, Ross Mangles and William Fraser McDonell (civilian magistrates, and personal friends of Wake, who had volunteered to serve with Dunbar's expedition) earned the Victoria Cross‚ÄîMangles, despite being wounded, carried a wounded soldier from the 37th Regiment of Foot for several miles while under fire, and McDonnell exposed himself to heavy fire to cut a rope that was preventing a boat from making its escape, saving the lives of 35 soldiers. The steamer carrying the expedition returned to Dinapore on 30 July, and families and friends were waiting at the dock expecting to welcome home the victorious men. When the steamer docked outside the hospital instead of at its usual berth, the spectators realised something was wrong. In the words of Tayler: \\"The scene that ensued was heart-rending, the soldiers' wives rushed down, screaming, to the edge of the water, beating their breasts and tearing their hair, despondency and despair were depicted on every countenance.\\" Out of 415 men, the expedition had suffered 170 fatalities and 120 wounded. =Second attempt= 200px Major Vincent Eyre, a Bengal Artillery officer in command of the East India Company's Number 1 Company, 4th Bengal Foot Artillery‚Äînow 58 (Eyre's) Battery, 12th Regiment Royal Artillery, British Army‚Äîthen stationed in Buxar, was under orders to head to Cawnpore with his battery. He had heard news of the situation in Arrah and, unaware of any relief expedition, decided on his own to collect troops to reinforce the expedition he believed would take place. Finding no troops available at Buxar, Eyre went to Ghazipur and was able to attach 25 men from the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot to his party. Upon returning to Buxar, Eyre found that 154 men from the 5th Regiment of Foot had arrived in his absence and he convinced their commander, Captain L'Estrange, to join him with the understanding that Eyre bore full responsibility. At this point, Eyre felt so confident of victory that he dismissed the men from the 78th Foot and went ahead without them. Unable to locate horses to move his battery's guns, Eyre used bullocks (neutered bulls) instead and was able to procure two elephants to move the party's baggage. After assembling a force of 225 men (including civilian volunteers) and three of his battery's guns, Eyre wrote to General Lloyd at Dinapore informing him of his intentions and requesting reinforcements. On 30 July, at about 4:00pm, Eyre's expedition started for Arrah. Lloyd's reply, informing Eyre of the failure of the first relief attempt and ordering him not to commence his mission, or to return to Buxar to await further orders if he had already started, arrived while the party was en route. Eyre disregarded Lloyd's order and continued towards Arrah. On 2 August, still over from his objective, Eyre's force encountered an estimated 2,000 to 2,500 mutinying sepoys accompanied by Kunwar Singh's forces‚Äîincluding Kunwar Singh himself‚Äîheaded to intercept him. Greatly outnumbered, Eyre's party became surrounded. He then ordered the infantry to charge with bayonets and the artillery to fire on the mutineers. This caused the mutinying sepoys to retreat, with an estimated 600 casualties. Eyre's party, with only two killed, then continued towards Arrah. Blocked by a river, they built a bridge which they completed the following day. When they crossed the river on the morning of 3 August, a villager gave them a letter from Wake telling them that the besieged men had heard about their approach, stating \\"We are all well.\\" House at Arrah fortified against the Dinapore Mutineers ‚Äì From a sketch by Sir Vincent Eyre, 1857 from the 300px Throughout the day of 2 August the besieged party heard distant cannon fire and saw people in the town hurriedly loading carts with their belongings. The constant fire from muskets on the building lessened and finally ceased; it was approached by two men, who told the occupants that the besiegers were defeated and a relief force was expected to arrive in Arrah the following day. The occupants were sceptical, despite visual evidence, and sent out a small party at midnight to reconnoitre the area‚Äîthey found no sign of the mutineers and brought in a large quantity of gunpowder and the mutineers' two artillery pieces. They then sent a party under cover of darkness to destroy a number of outhouses which the mutineers had been using as cover. This party discovered a mine dug directly under the foundations of the building by the mutineers, charged and ready to be primed, so this charge was destroyed by them. The following morning at about 7:00am, two members of Major Eyre's expedition arrived at the house and the siege was officially broken. Eyre, in his official report, wrote that Wake's defence of the building \\"seems to have been almost miraculous.\\" About the outcome of the first relief attempt, he wrote: \\"I venture to affirm, confidently, that no such disaster would have been likely to occur, had that detachment advanced less precipitately, so as to have given full time for my force to approach direct from the opposite side, for the rebels would then have been hemmed in between the two opposing forces, and must have been utterly routed.\\" According to Wake's official report about the siege, \\"Nothing but cowardice, want of unanimity, and only the ignorance of our enemies, prevented our fortification being brought down about our ears.\\" In his own report, Tayler wrote, \\"The conduct of the garrison is most creditable, and the gallantry and fidelity of the Sikhs beyond all praise.\\" =Awards= For their actions during the siege, Wake was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and Boyle was made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India after the 1861 creation of the order. A few days after the relief of Arrah, the 50 besieged members of the Bengal Military Police Battalion received a gratuity of 12 months' pay as a reward for their loyalty and Jemadar Singh was promoted to Subedar upon Wake's recommendation. For its actions in Arrah the Bengal Military Police Battalion received the Defence of Arrah (1857) battle honour and was also given the Bihar (1857) battle honour for its role in safeguarding the area. These battle honours are unique to the Bengal Military Police Battalion as they were awarded to no other unit. Major Eyre was recommended for the Victoria Cross by Sir James Outram, Commissioner of Oude and the overall military commander for the region, for his conduct in Arrah, but this was not awarded. Aftermath Eyre, after receiving reinforcements, pursued Kunwar Singh's forces to Singh's palace in Jagdispur. Many civilians who were besieged in Arrah, including Wake (still commanding the 50 men of the Bengal Military Police Battalion), volunteered to serve with him. Although Singh's forces were routed and the palace occupied by 12 August, Singh had fled. Eyre's force destroyed most of the town of Jagdispur including the palace (in the nearby jungle), Singh's brothers' houses and a Brahmin temple. Eyre was publicly censured by Governor General Canning in The London Gazette for the temple's destruction. The Siege of Arrah marked the beginning of Singh's fight against the East India Company. Following Arrah he fought on, first leading his irregular forces to Lucknow, then keeping them together during an organised retreat back to Jagdispur. Singh died in April 1858. His irregular forces continued to fight, repelling an expedition sent to destroy them, until they finally laid down their arms in November 1858 as part of the general amnesty. Following the general amnesty, unrest continued, and peace was not officially declared until 8 July 1859. The besieged building still stands on the grounds of Maharaja College, Arrah, where it now houses a museum commemorating the life of Kunwar Singh, although according to Abhay Kumar of the Deccan Herald, as of May 2015 it \\"hardly has any item related to Kunwar Singh.\\" Legacy After visiting the site in 1864, Trevelyan wrote:  References  = Citations = = Sources =   1857 in India 19th-century military history of the United Kingdom Arrah Battles of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 Bengal Presidency History of Bihar History of Patna Conflicts in 1857 Military history of British India Sieges Sieges involving the United Kingdom Sieges of the Industrial era July 1857 events August 1857 events ","title":"Siege of Arrah"},{"id":"51105626","text":"Anna Matyushkina Anna Matyushkina (1722-1804), was a Russian courtier.

In the refrain, the son greets his mother and, with a sob, she greets her dearest boy. The son asks how she's doing (\\"how are you, old woman\\"), but her answer is only that she misses him so much. When the woman asks about his wife, her son tells her that they talk about her every day and that the children pray for the granny they've never met each evening and kiss her portrait before going to sleep.

Celestia Marguerita Johnson Taylor (April 8, 1903 ‚Äì July 28, 1996) was a professor of English at Brigham Young University (BYU) and a member of the Relief Society general board. She wrote a column on homemaking for Relief Society Magazine (1966‚Äì70). She was an avid singer and sang in many musical performances at BYU. Early life Taylor was born on April 8, 1903 in Alpine, Utah. Her parents were Jesse Wanderus and Deseret Nash Johnson. Her father, Jesse, was a school principal and business organizer. Her childhood was a happy one; her parents provided her with \\"every advantage our world had to offer.\\" She attended high school at the BYU high school. Taylor and her sister Violet would accompany professors on their lecture tours in neighboring towns to sing and read poetry. As a teenager she was in high demand as a babysitter, because she would often wash floors or iron shirts at the same time, feeling compelled to do unfinished household chores. Her first year of high school, she took on responsibility for the family cow, milking it and taking it out to pasture two miles away. Education She studied music and education at BYU. She was awarded \\"most popular girl of the year\\" her freshman year in 1922, won a vocal contest in 1923, and graduated in 1925. She and her sister Violet studied at UC Berkeley the summer after Taylor's graduation. The next summer, she attended the Columbia Teachers College in New York City. She married Lynn Dixon Taylor in August 1927, and together they had five children. Lynn joined the faculty at BYU in 1931, enabling Celestia to take classes free of charge. She took classes from Lynn, Alice Louise Reynolds, Elise Chamberlain Carrol, and P.A. Christianson. Later on, the dean of graduate studies told her she could apply much of her credit to a master's degree if she completed it in the next two years, and in 1953 she received her MA. Taylor taught English at BYU until 1974. She taught English as a second language to international students, freshman English, and other English courses. She served as vice president of BYU's alumni association, on the executive board of Friends of the BYU library, and as BYU Women president. She was a member of various writing organizations and between 1980‚Äì82 she was president of the National League of American Pen Women. Music As a girl and teenager, Taylor studied music with Clair Reid at BYU. Reid often placed Taylor in vocal solos with BYU choirs in high school and college. Together with her sisters Violet and Rhoda, Taylor sang in \\"The Johnson Sisters Trio.\\" During the flu epidemic of 1918, the trio, along with Murray Roberts, sang many graveside funeral arrangements‚Äîas many as four in one day. Taylor and Violet sang in the Provo Tabernacle Choir under the direction of Professor J. R. Boshard. She was state chairwoman of fine arts for the Utah State Federated Women's club for three years. She sang a part in most of Florence Jepperson's productions, including in the chorus of Priscilla. Taylor sang in many operas and musicals and performed in plays during her high school and college years. She won the last worldwide Church chorus competition in directing both a women's chorus and the men's chorus (afterwards competitions were strictly regional). She sang as an opera singer in William Hanson's local opera \\"Tam- Man Nacup\\" in 1933 and at Gerrit de Jong's organ recital in 1936. She was a member and officer of the Utah Opera Association. Church service She was a member of the Relief Society general board between 1962‚Äì75. She wrote a report on \\"divine law and church government\\" about how the church helps members to progress. She wrote the column \\"Development Through Homemaking Education\\" for Relief Society Magazine between 1966‚Äì70, covering diverse topics like family budgeting, record keeping, interior decorating, and storing food for hard times.

He was also heavily criticised for expanding the union into Northern Ireland where a row took place with the rival GMB union. Mitchell took legal action to secure reinstatement but eventually the union made a settlement with him, but he was not reinstated. In 1994, IDATU merged with the Irish National Union of Vintners', Grocers' and Allied Trades Assistants to form Mandate. General Secretaries :1901: Michael O'Lehane :1920: John G.

Completed in 1999, it generates enough electricity for 300,000 people, and the reservoir is a tourist attraction. The dam displaced many families from the area now covered by the reservoir, and the submerged, decaying vegetation has had negative impact on water quality in and below the dam, affecting edible fish stocks. Location The dam impounds the Manso River in the upper Paraguay sub-basin of the Paran√° basin. The reservoir is in the municipalities of Chapada dos Guimar√£es and Ros√°rio Oeste in the midwest region of Mato Grosso. It is the largest in the Paraopeba system. The dam is from Cuiab√°, the state capital, along good roads. It is about above sea level. The lake has become a tourist attraction. Structure The dam project was launched in 1974, when a flood of the Cuiab√° River left more than 20% of the population of the state capital homeless. The objective was to control flooding while generating electricity, developing tourism and supporting irrigation. Construction began in 1988 and was completed in 1999. The dam has a height of . of concrete were used in construction. Total cost was R$340 million. The reservoir covers an area of . It was full in 2001. The operating contract is 70% owned by Eletrobras Furnas. Installed capacity is 212 MW, with guaranteed output of 92 MW. It can meet the power demands of 300,000 people. After an extended drought, in December 2015 the water level had fallen to 28.7% of capacity. However, record rainfall raised it to 76% by June 2016. At 70% capacity the water line is above the minimum operating level. Social and environmental impact Relatively little information was provided about the dam to the affected people in Mato Grosso. 109 properties were requisitioned for the project, and between 652 and 1,065 families were displaced. The displaced families were settled in areas with sandy soil, unsuitable for agriculture, and given insanitary straw shacks as homes. The reservoir submerged a significant quantity of biomass, which was not cleared before construction started. This reduces dissolved oxygen levels as it decays and encourages proliferation of water weeds. Rather than use a surface-level channel to divert excess water downstream, the design uses a drain from the reservoir bottom, feeding the worst-quality water downstream. This has had a negative effect on edible fish stocks in the Cuiab√° River. By reducing flooding the dam affects the Mato Grosso Pantanal environment, which depends on seasonal floods, but does not fully protect Cuiab√° from floods when the reservoir is full.

As a result, slavery has remained legal in the \\"Hard Four\\" (a group of southern states which have kept slavery): Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and a unified Carolina. Its name evokes the Underground Railroad in relations to its setting. The novel attracted praise for exploring racism through the alternate-history mechanism. Plot The novel is narrated by Victor, a former Person Bound to Labor ('peeb') who, after escaping the Hard Four, has been forced to work as an undercover agent for U.S. Marshal Bridge, infiltrating and gathering evidence to prosecute fellow escapees and the people and organisations helping peebs escape slavery. If Victor refuses to help, the agent has threatened to return him to the plantation from which he escaped; and he can be tracked by a device implanted in his spine if he tries to run. As the novel opens, Victor is tracking down the peeb escapee Jackdaw, whose last known whereabouts have led Victor to Indianapolis. His trail ends at Saint Anselm's Catholic Promise, a seemingly derelict community center run by Father Barton. Victor poses as Jim Dirkson, a consultant for Indonesian cell carrier Sulawesi Digital, looking to expand into the United States, seeking to get his wife Gentle out of the Carolina plantation she is enslaved in and into Little America, a suburb of Montreal mainly populated by African- Americans in exile. Victor befriends Martha, a white woman with a mixed-race child, after they are ejected from a hotel for stealing from the breakfast buffet. Eventually, Victor locates Jackdaw, who is revealed to be a freeborn African-American college student named Kevin. He was sent by Barton to infiltrate Garments of the Greater South, Inc., purportedly to expose how they have been illegally selling slave-made goods to the rest of the United States (where such goods are unlawful) through shell companies located in Malaysia. Barton contends that this explosive revelation could bring down slavery, or at least assassinate the credibility of its proponents. Kevin, however, refuses to give up the location of the 'evidence' unless they also extract a slave girl he'd fallen for during his year behind the Fence. In a commotion, he is shot dead by an Indianapolis police officer who is working with Father Barton after he became enraged at the news that the girl was probably dead. Victor is then coerced by Father Barton to go back to GGSI to retrieve the intel. Victor deduces something larger is at play and gets Martha to play his 'Missus' through the slavery-embracing Hard Four states so they can investigate GGSI. Martha, for her part, is seeking access to Torchlight; a centralized registry of every Person Bound to Labor in the United States - specifically, she wants to find out what happened to Samson, her son's father. Victor decides to double-cross Father Barton, and makes another deal with Bridge. He does not believe the intelligence being retrieved would make any difference, and decides to use the U.S. Marshal Service to secure his own freedom. Bridge is compelled to play along after Victor bluffs about the damaging nature of the evidence to the Service. At the Fence, Victor disguises himself as Martha's slave, endures a dehumanizing inspection by Internal Border and Regulation agents, and the two make their way to Green Hollow, Alabama. In Green Hollow, Victor sends Martha back north and meets up with former peebs who hide out at a sympathetic old white lawyer's mansion; he is accommodated there as he prepares to insert himself into GGSI. Martha unexpectedly returns to Victor's side, and they succeed in infiltrating GGSI's HQ, obtaining the intel as well as information on Samson. He and Martha are unexpectedly abducted by IMPD Officer Cook, one of Father Barton's colleagues from Indianapolis. It turns out that Cook, like Victor, is also an undercover agent for the Marshal Service; he betrays both Father Barton and Victor to secure his own freedom. In the ensuing struggle, Cook is shot dead. When confronted by Victor, Father Barton reveals that the evidence is much more horrifying: GGSI has been experimenting with the eggs of female slaves to genetically produce a new line of slaves who can be legally classified as non-humans. Victor pretends to co- operate with Barton. Telling Bridge he has the intel, they rendezvous in a makeshift operating tent off of a highway, so his tracking implant can be removed and Bridge can give him a new identity. During the exchange, however, Barton and his comrades ambush Bridge, killing the medical technician he'd brought along, and is about to kill Bridge, when Victor says to spare him instead. In gratitude, Bridge removes the implant himself, and Victor passes out, waking up to an empty tent. The novel ends with the undercover Victor and Martha in Chicago, checking into the HQ of the elevator company that contracts with GGSI - plotting sabotage. Development history Winters cites Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man as a strong influence on the finished novel. Recognition The novel was a finalist for the 2017 Chautauqua Prize, the 2017 Southern Book Prize, the 2017 International Thriller Award, and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel of the Year. The book won the 2016 Sidewise Award for Alternate History. =Publication history= =Cover art= The United States hardback edition cover was designed by Oliver Munday. An alternative cover for the UK edition featured a background with the stars and bars from the Confederate Battle Flag. Reception In an early review, Kirkus Reviews called the novel's premise \\"worthy of Philip K. Dick ... smart and well-paced.\\" The book debuted on the New York Times hardcover best-seller list at #20, and was ranked #11 on the Indie Bestsellers list. Charles Finch wrote, in a review for USA Today, the novel had a \\"rather prosaic plotline\\" and \\"many of [the novel's] big turns are anticlimactic\\" but overall, it was \\"a swift, smart, angry new novel [that] illuminates all the ways that slavery has endured into the present day ‚Äî by depicting an alternate world in which it has endured\\" and called it an astonishing feat of world-building. In a review for The Washington Post, Jon Michaud found the \\"alternate history that does not feel fully realised [in] its rendering of popular culture\\" was \\"slightly distracting\\" but overall, the novel was a success \\"because its fiction is disturbingly close to our present reality.\\" Many reviewers probed the novel's premise and found it reasonable. Maureen Corrigan, writing for National Public Radio, called the novel \\"one suspenseful tale filled with double crosses and dangerous expeditions\\" set in \\"a disturbing but plausible alternate reality for the United States.\\" Kathryn Schulz, reviewing the novel for The New Yorker, said \\"Winters gets the balance right. He is careful to set up a plausible case for how history shifted off- kilter ... and he paints a convincing picture of what fugitive life would look like in our own era. =Racial controversy= A profile in The New York Times called the novel \\"creatively and professionally risky\\" for Winters, as fellow author Lev Grossman was quoted describing Winters as \\"fearless\\" for being \\"a white writer going after questions of what it's like to be black in America.\\" Corrigan wrote that a white author imagining the thoughts and experiences of a black character was potentially controversial. Other critics of the Times profile felt that Winters was being unfairly lionised, especially since the themes of science fiction, racism and slavery had in fact been explored before, most notably by African-American author Octavia Butler in her 1979 novel Kindred. Winters had already acknowledged Butler's influence in a blog post published three weeks before the profile in the Times. Adaptation Winters has written the pilot script for a television adaptation.

Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 83-99 (p. 84). Though there may already have been anthologies of riddles written down in the Hellenistic period, these do not survive.Jan Kwapisz, 'Were there Hellenistic Riddle Books?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 148-67. By far the largest extant collection of Antique Greek riddles is Book 14 of the Greek Anthology, as preserved in Codex Parisianus suppl. Graecus 384, which contains about 50 verse riddles.E. S. Forster, 'Riddles and Problems from the Greek Anthology', Greece & Rome, 14 (1945), 42-47. They are in a group of about 150 puzzles: the first fifty or so are oracles; the second fifty or so are arithmetical problems; and the third fifty or so riddles in the traditional sense. The date when this compilation was originally made is uncertain, and the dates of individual riddles even less clear: the oldest may go back to Archaic Greek, the youngest to Byzantine;Christine Luz, 'What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 83-99 (p. 83, n. 1). but the emergence of the compilation in its present form is generally associated with Constantine Cephalas, working in the tenth century.Jan Kwapisz, 'Were there Hellenistic Riddle Books?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 148-67 (p. 148). Most concern everyday objects such as smoke, a fish, a mirror, wine, or pipes; the second largest group concern mythological figures, taxing the audience's knowledge of the details of their stories.Christine Luz, 'What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 83-99 (pp. 91-93). It is likely that among the forerunners of the Greek Anthology, the ninth-century anthology of Cephalus contained riddles.A. Cameron, The Greek Anthology from Meleager to Planudes (Oxford: Clarendon, 1993) 207-16. Allegedly, Athenaeus of Naucratis (fl. c. 200 AD) compiled a copious anthology of ancient Greek riddles citing some 1,250 authors under the title Epitome. =Ancient riddles and riddle- culture= According to Naerebout and Beerden, > In the competitive Greek societies, words were a primary locus of > competition: there can be no doubt about the popularity of wordplay in the > Greek world. Riddles shared in this popularity: sympotic riddles are > particularly well attested--it seems there was no symposium without a fair > number of riddles. The contest-riddle was a known form of riddling. So > riddling pervaded Greek life on many levels and during many > occasions.Frederick G. Naerebout and Kim Beerden, ' \\"Gods Cannot Tell Lies\\": > Riddling and Ancient Greek Divination', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and > Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and > Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 121-47 (p. 140). A key source for this culture is Athenaeus.Erin Sebo, 'In scirpo nodum: Symphosius‚Äô Reworking of the Riddle Form', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski, Beitr√§ge zur Altertumskunde (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 184-95 (p. 184). The most famous Classical riddle is the Riddle of the Sphinx: Oedipus killed the Sphinx by grasping the answer to the riddle it posed.Oedipus Tyrannus, lines 380 onward. This is just one example, however, of a considerable body of riddlic oracles in Ancient Greek literature: the gods' enigmatic answers to people asking questions of oracles appears to have been a significant literary trope, amongst other things a way to warn listeners of the perils and difficulties of seeking divine guidance.Frederick G. Naerebout and Kim Beerden, ' \\"Gods Cannot Tell Lies\\": Riddling and Ancient Greek Divination', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 121-47. Heraclitus's enigmatic style overlaps to some extent with riddles.Lisa Maurizio, ‚ÄòTechnopaegnia in Heraclitus and the Delphic Oracles: Shared Compositional Techniques', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 100-120. Although Plato reports that ancient Greek children did indeed engage in riddle play (Republic 479c), he also recognized the important function that riddles can play in showing what cannot literally be said about ultimate truths (Letters, book 2, 312d). Aristotle considered riddles important enough to include discussion of their use in his Rhetoric. He describes the close relationship between riddles and metaphors: \\"Good riddles do, in general, provide us with satisfactory metaphors; for metaphors imply riddles, and therefore a good riddle can furnish a good metaphor\\".1405b4-6; cf. 1458a; cf. Christine Luz, 'What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 83-99 (p. 97). Aristotle is not known to have composed riddles, but 'among his pseudepigrapha there apparently was a collection of metaphorical, riddle-like phrases and expressions', now lost. Some of the riddles in the Greek Anthology may date back to the ancient period. The following, for example, is an example of the widespread year-riddle attributed to Cleobulus (fl. C6 BCE): > There is one father and twelve children; of these each > Has twice thirty daughters of different appearance: > Some are white to look at and the others black in turn; > They are immortal and yet they all fade away.Quoted from Christine Luz, > 'What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?', in > The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan > Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. > 83-99 (p. 86). (The answer is the year and its days and nights.) Other examples from the Greek Anthology, as translated by E. S. Forster, include: > My mother I bring forth, she brings forth me: > I'm sometimes greater, sometimes less than she. (xiv.41) > I look at you whene'er you look at me; > You see but I see not; no sight have I; > I speak but have no voice; your voice is heard; > My lips can only open uselessly. (iv.56) > One wind there is: ten sailors row amain > Two vessels, and one steersman steers the twain. (xiv.14) > I am a black child sprung from a bright sire, > A wingless bird, fleeting to heaven from earth. > Each eye that meets me weeps, but not from grief, > And in thin air I vanish at my birth. (xiv.5) > A blackened lump am I-and fire begat me: > My mother was a tree on mountain steep. > I save from wounds the chariot of the sea, > If my sire melts me in a vessel deep. (xiv.61) The answer are: night and day; a reflection in a mirror; double flute played by one person with ten fingers; smoke; pitch, used for caulking ships.E. S. Forster, 'Riddles and Problems from the Greek Anthology', Greece & Rome, 14 (1945), 42-47 (pp. 43-44). The last of Greece's known literary non-Christian riddle-masters is the Emperor Julian. Byzantine period Greek riddles copied by the Byzantine monk Maximus Planudes in the last two decades of the thirteenth century in Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Plutei 32.16, f. 382v. Literary riddles were also composed in Byzantium, from perhaps the tenth century with the work of John Geometres, into the fifteenth century, along with a neo-Byzantine revival in around the early eighteenth century. There was a particular peak around the long twelfth century: Christopher of Mytilene's œÉœÑŒØœáŒøŒπ Œ¥ŒπŒ¨œÜŒøœÅŒøŒπ ('Various Verses') contain riddles, while John Mauropous, Michael Psellos, Basilios Megalomites, Theodore Prodromos, Eustathios Makrembolites, and Manuel Moschopoulos were all part of this movement.Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 42-52. In form, > Byzantine riddles differ from classical ones more in terms of metre than in > terms of subject-matter. [...] The structure of the riddle is basically the > same. Most often a riddle is built around a paradoxical or ironical > antithesis. The subject nearly always speaks of itself in the first person > (in a personified form). Its speech usually begins with an explanation of > its origins, provenance, birth, etc., in terms like: 'my mother was such- > and-such, my father is so-and-so', or 'without my mother's help my father > has given birth to me' (a very popular formula). At the end of its speech > the subject will occasionally address the reader and dare him to use his > brains and find the correct answer. =Forms and subjects= The main edition of Byzantine riddles, by ƒåelica Milovanoviƒá, covers 214 of about 300 known riddles. Milovanoviƒá divides the corpus into the following genres, and identifies riddles on the following subjects (alongside 29 without a known solution [nos. 186-214]; the lists below give the numbers of each riddle in her edition).ŒíœÖŒ∂Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩŒ± Œ±ŒπŒΩŒπŒ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±: –í–∏–∑–∞–Ω—Ç–∏—ò—Å–∫–µ –∑–∞–≥–æ–Ω–µ—Ç–∫–µ [Byzantina aenigmata: Vizantijske zagonetke/ŒíœÖŒ∂Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩŒ± Œ±ŒπŒΩŒπŒ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±: Les √ânigmes Byzantines, ed. and trans.

True riddles (nos. 1‚Äì80) An example of one of the true riddles is this, on a writing tablet: 'Wood gave birth to me and iron reformed me, and I am the mystic receptacle of the Muses. When shut I am silent, but I speak when you unfold me. Ares alone is the confidant of my conversation', where Ares is not only the name of a god, but a poetic term for a stylus.

Letter riddles (nos. 81‚Äì144)  Byzantine riddles include many whose solution is arrived at through clues based on spelling. In some cases, this involves subtracting a letter from a word. Thus a riddle attributed to Basilos Megalomites says 'A tiny animal, I am not edible; my name consists of three letters only; should you take away the first of my letters, I'd be a large one, and ready for eating'. The answer is both ŒºœÖœÇ ('mouse') and œÖœÇ ('hog').

Questions and answers (Nos. 145‚Äì185)  Alongside folk-riddles and literary riddles, Byzantine riddles also include question-and-answer riddles whose form is not sophisticated, but whose content tests knowledge of the Bible. This corpus is attested from the early fifth century onwards. One example of the form runs 'Who upon dying was not buried, and yet was not stinking? The wife of Lot, fleeing from Sodom, became a pillar of salt and is standing to this day'.

Modern Greek A key collection of modern Greek riddles is N. G. Polites, 'Demode Ainigmata', in Neohellenika Analekta, I (Athens, 1870), 193-256. Influence It is likely that Greek riddles were among the influences on the seventh- to eighth-century Anglo-Latin poet Aldhelm.

In Masters-level swimming she is one of the most decorated athletes in the history of the sport and was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2015. Early life Pipes was born in 1962 in Lompoc, California, and learned to swim by taking classes at the local YMCA at the age of four. By the age of six, she had competed in her first race for the Lompoc Marlins. In 1970, Pipes moved to Chula Vista, CA a city south of San Diego. At 15 years old, she won the 400-yard medley at the National Junior Olympic Swimming Championships, coached by two-time Olympic Gold medalist Mike Troy competing for the Coronado Navy Swim Association. She graduated from Coronado High School in 1980. She was offered 15 full-ride scholarships to NCAA Division I schools and accepted one from the University of Arkansas.http://www.ishof.org/karlyn-pipes.html http://www.lavendermagazine.com/uncategorized/swimming-straight-for-inclusion/ Career By the age of 19, her party lifestyle, \\"poor work ethic\\" and \\"lack of discipline\\" caused her to forfeit her scholarship at Arkansas after three semesters. Pipes describes the next chapter of her life as the \\"lost years\\" when her addictive tendencies took over and her life began to spiral out of control. For the next 11 years Pipes dropped out of college numerous times, worked as a seasonal beach lifeguard, was a waitress and held other odd jobs such as a bartender at Hotel del Coronado. On April 16, 1993, at the age of 31, Pipes entered a ten-day alcohol and drug rehabilitation program at Sharp Cabrillo Hospital. Immediately upon her release, Pipes returned to the water to help her recover, heal and regain lost strength. Three months later, she stepped up on the blocks to race again and began competing in U.S. Masters Swimming competitions. After six months of sobriety, Pipes established a new FINA world record in the 200-meter backstroke. By the end of her first year of Masters competition, she ranked first in the U.S. in seven events and added three more world records to her cache. In 1995, she set a total of 16 FINA Masters world records for the 30‚Äì34 age group, competing against many former Olympians. By the time she was 35, she was ranked first in the United States in every distance and stroke in 54 official events in the 35-39 age group and came within a few tenths of a second to qualify for the 1996 US Olympic Trials in the 200-meter backstroke. In 1995, she restarted her collegiate swimming career by competing for Palomar Junior College. Over the next two years she held a 4.0 GPA, broke every women's school record but one, set 4 National and 5 State Community College records and was twice named the Pacific Coast Conference Swimmer of the Year. In 1997, Pipes accepted a full athletic scholarship to attend Cal State Bakersfield, where she graduated cum laude with a BS in communications in 1999.

It is loosely inspired by the Manson Family and the murder of actress Sharon Tate. The majority of the novel is set in 1969 and focuses on 14 year old Evie Boyd who feels isolated and unloved and ends up spending the majority of that summer with a group of teenage girls on a ranch who are all devoted to a man named Russell. Synopsis In the present day Evie Boyd is a middle-aged woman with few ties. An old friend of hers allows her to stay in his home when she is between jobs. While there she thinks that house is being broken into and comes to realize it is only her friend's teenage son Julian and his girlfriend Sasha who have arrived unannounced. Julian does not remember Evie at first but eventually recalls that Evie was involved in a famous cult. This makes Evie recall the summer of 1969, when she was 14. By 1969 Evie's parents had divorced with Evie's father moving in with his young assistant and Evie's mother dating a married man named Frank. Evie spent most of her days with her best friend, Connie, falling in love with her brother. She also saw a group of ragtag girls hanging around the town and dumpster diving. After Connie's brother Peter runs off with his pregnant girlfriend, Connie and Evie have a falling out with Connie accusing Evie of only being there for her brother. Evie later runs into one of the girls she had seen, Suzanne, and buys her toilet paper she was trying to shoplift. Later on, after getting into a fight with her mother, Evie runs into Suzanne and the girls again. This time they bring her to the ranch where they live where they introduce her to Russell, their enigmatic leader. Evie realizes that all the girls have sex with Russell. During her first visit Russell also forces her to perform oral sex on him. Evie continues to visit the ranch and the girls over the course of the summer, stealing money from her mother to give to them and pretending that she is spending time with Connie. Evie is drawn more to Suzanne than Russell and continues to do what she can to spend more time with her. She also learns that Mitch Lewis, a famous singer, is a patron of Russell's and has promised to help him obtain a record deal. One day, when Mitch visits the farm Russell has Suzanne and Evie return to his home with them. Evie watches Suzanne and Mitch have sex and is later pressured into a threesome with them which she reluctantly goes along with as she is attracted to Suzanne. After the threesome Evie returns home, but finding her life dull and tired she eventually returns to the farm. To cheer her up Suzanne takes her to break into an empty home. Evie suggests they break into her neighbour's home, but her neighbour arrives home early and catches her. Evie is punished by her mother and sent to go live with her father in Palo Alto. Evie has a surprisingly good time there, spending most of her time with her father's young girlfriend, Tamar, who treats her like a younger sister. Eventually though, Evie decides to return to the ranch. Running away from home Evie hitch-hikes and is driven to the ranch by a young university student named Tom, who is intrigued by Evie's description of the place. When they arrive Tom is disgusted by the air of decay while Evie is surprised to find the atmosphere of the ranch changed and depressed. Tom eventually leaves. Suzanne prepares to go out on an errand and Evie, chasing after her, is allowed to come along. As they are driving to Mitch Lewis's home Suzanne sees Evie looking at her with love and desperation and kicks her out of the car. Evie phones home and is picked up by Tamar. The following morning she learns that the group went to Mitch's house and, not finding him, killed his groundskeeper, the groundskeeper's girlfriend, an ex-girlfriend of Mitch's and her five year old son. Evie later learns this was because Mitch was unable to procure a record deal for Russell. Evie finishes out the rest of the summer and is sent to a boarding school in Carmel. She settles down into student life but is visited once by her \\"sister\\" who turns out to be Suzanne. A few months later the girls and Russell are arrested and put on trial where they become infamous. Evie continues to wonder whether she would have joined in the murders if Suzanne had not forced her out of the car. She also feels that Suzanne had been trying to get her to live a normal, ordered life, though she feels as though her life as an adult has been boring and unfulfilling while Suzanne was given multiple opportunities and infamy after her stint in prison. Reception The Washington Post wrote a favorable review, praising Cline's writing. NPR and The New York Times also reviewed the work, the former of which wrote that \\"Emma Cline's thoroughly seductive debut novel, The Girls, re-imagines the world of Charles Manson's female followers, and does so with a particularly effective literary device.\\" It was winner of the Shirley Jackson Award for Best Novel 2016.

Such ceremonies took many forms, including the tapping of the flat side of a sword on the shoulders of a candidate or an embrace about the neck. In the first example, the \\"knight-elect\\" kneels in front of the monarch on a knighting-stool. The monarch lays the side of the sword's blade onto the candidate's right shoulder. The monarch then raises the sword gently just up over the apprentice's head and places it on his left shoulder. The newly appointed knight arises, and the administrator presents him with the insignia of their knightly order. In the painting, the ceremony is performed by a young queen, the knight bowed before her feet in a position of submission and fealty. An audience is gathered on the Queen's left, serving as witnesses to the ceremony. Reception All Art Classics describes Accolade as Leighton's best-known work and Kara Ross, Director of Operations for the Art Renewal Center, describes it as \\"the epitome of medieval iconography\\" and as one of Leighton's most famous works, which \\"are among the most widely recognized paintings of the period.\\" Sotheby's catalogue describes it as one of \\"the most memorable\\" of his medieval subjects. It also notes that among this collection, \\"the two qualities which can always be found... are beautifully meticulous studied detail and a sensitive capturing of humanity\\".

She published her first novel, The Girls, in 2016, to positive reviews. The book was shortlisted for the John Leonard Award from the National Book Critics Circle and the Center for Fiction's First Novel Prize. Her stories have been published in The New Yorker, Tin House, Granta and The Paris Review. In 2017 Cline was named one of Granta's Best Young American Novelists. She is a recipient of the Plimpton Prize.  Life and career  = Personal life = Emma Cline, born in 1989, was raised in Sonoma County, California. As a young teenager, Cline had acting roles in When Billie Beat Bobby (2001) and a short film entitled Flashcards (2003). After graduating from Sonoma Academy at age 16, Cline attended Middlebury College in Vermont. During her first year at college, she won a writing award for her short story, \\"What is Lost\\". After graduating, Cline attended Columbia University where she received her MFA in 2013. While at Columbia University, she wrote \\"Marion\\", a short piece of fiction which was published by The Paris Review in their 2013 summer issue. A year later, The Paris Review selected Emma Cline to receive their annual Plimpton Prize for this same work, an award of $10,000. Since then, her writing has been published in multiple journals, and in 2016 she published The Girls, her debut novel. = The Girls = Cline's first novel, The Girls, was published in 2016 by Random House Publishing. Cline was offered a $2 million advance by Random House, who outbid 11 other publishers for the novel. American film producer Scott Rudin bought the film rights to the book shortly before it was acquired by the Random House. The novel is based in part on the Charles Manson cult and murders of the late 1960s. The story is told from the view point of Evie Boyd, a fourteen-year-old girl whose childhood is changed when she is introduced to a cult. Evie as an adult reflects on her actions as a child, bringing up questions of what it means to grow up as a girl and how injustice in the world can lead to terrible violence. While Cline is celebrated for her descriptive abilities and attention to gender structures, critics have also said that the cult setting seemed unnecessary to the novel and left the ending feeling unfulfilled. Still, the book was received well by the general public, and The Girls spent three months on The New York Times' best-seller list. It won the 2016 Shirley Jackson Award for Best Novel. The movie production for the novel is in the development stages. = Other endeavors = Penguin Books (under imprint, Chatto & Windus) published Cline's first collection of short stories, Daddy, in 2020. = Copyright lawsuit = In February 2017, Emma Cline's former boyfriend, Chaz Reetz-Laiolo, accused Cline of plagiarizing his work for her novel The Girls. Reetz-Laiolo, who is also a writer, said that Cline installed a spyware program on his computer in order to read his personal work and emails without his consent. Chaz Reetz- Laiolo's team indicated that unless Cline was willing to pay reparations for copyright, a public court filing would be made which included sexually explicit images and text messages of Emma Cline that were acquired by Reetz- Laiolo. In October 2017, the firm redrafted their initial request and withdrew all of the sexually explicit material of Cline. Cline responded to the allegations with a countersuit, arguing that the reason she installed spyware was for her own protection and to see if Reetz-Laiolo was cheating on her. She said that he had been physically and emotionally abusive during their previous relationship. In regards to the plagiarism accusation, Cline's case considered the cited similarities between Reetz-Laiolo's work and The Girls to be minimal, stating that many were only one or two word phrases. Random House issued a statement saying they stood in full support of Emma Cline, and believed her to be a victim in the case. In late November 2017, Reetz-Laiolo and Cline officially filed their lawsuits in federal court in San Francisco. In June 2018, the copyright claim was dismissed by Judge William Orrick, who said the similarities between the works were general and not protectable: \\"Both stories are ‚Äòcoming of age‚Äô tales of sorts. But they vary significantly in detail, breadth and texture.\\" In a hearing, Judge Orrick condemned the actions of Reetz-Laiolo's lawyers, calling their behavior \\"remarkably offensive.\\"  Bibliography  = Books = = Fiction and essays = * ‚ÄúLos Angeles,‚Äù Granta * ‚ÄúNortheast Regional,‚Äù The New Yorker * ‚ÄúMarion,‚Äù The Paris Review * ‚ÄúThe Drive Home,‚Äù The New York Times * ‚ÄúFleeing the Fires in Sonoma County,‚Äù The New Yorker * ‚ÄúArcadia,‚Äù Granta * ‚ÄúArchie Comics,‚Äù The New Yorker * ‚ÄúSee Me,‚Äù The Paris Review * ‚ÄúPerseids,‚Äù Tin House * ‚ÄúSon of Friedman,\\" The New Yorker * \\"The Nanny,\\" The Paris Review * \\"White Noise,\\" The New Yorker = Anthology = * The Unprofessionals: New American Writing from The Paris Review References Living people 21st-century American novelists Middlebury College alumni Columbia University School of the Arts alumni American women novelists 21st-century American women writers Novelists from California American women short story writers 21st-century American short story writers People from Sonoma County, California Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Emma Cline"},{"id":"51106146","text":"Lahib (foaled 23 April 1988) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was unraced as a juvenile and won once from two starts as a three-year-old in the spring of 1991. In the following year he improved to become one of the best milers in Europe, winning the Queen Anne Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes as well as finishing second in the Lockinge Stakes, Prix Jacques Le Marois and Champion Stakes. He was retired from racing at the end of the year and became a breeding stallion. He had some success as a sire of winners. Background Lahib was a brown horse with a white sock on his left hind leg bred in Kentucky by his owner Hamdan Al Maktoum. He was sired by Riverman a French horse who won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains in 1972. As a breeding stallion he was highly successful, being the sire of many important winners including Irish River, Detroit, Bahri, Gold River, River Memories and Triptych. Lahib's dam, Lady Cutlass won three races from seven starts in the United States between 1980 and 1982 and was a half- sister to General Store, whose descendants have included Al Bahathri, Military Attack, Red Cadeaux and Haafhd. Hamdan Al Maktoum opted to race Lahib in Europe and sent him into training with John Dunlop at Arundel in West Sussex. He was ridden in all but one of his races by the Scottish jockey Willie Carson. Racing career =1991: three-year-old season= Lahib did not race as a two-year-old, making his debut in a maiden race over one mile at Newbury Racecourse on 20 April 1991. Starting at odds of 7/1 he took the lead a furlong out but was caught in the final strides and beaten a head by Ristna, a filly who went on to win the Sun Chariot Stakes. Twelve days later at Newmarket Racecourse Lahib started 11/10 favourite for a similar event over the same distance and recorded his first victory, beating Close Fried by a neck. The colt had training problems thereafter, and missed the rest of the season. He underwent surgery on his forelegs and a further operation on an undescended testicle. =1992: four-year-old season= After an absence of more than eleven months, Lahib returned to the track in April 2012 and finished sixth of the eight runners behind Sure Sharp in the Group Three Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket. A month later the colt was moved up to Group Two level and started a 16/1 outsider in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury. Ridden by Richard Quinn (Carson was riding Hamdan Al Maktoum's more fancied Mukaddamah) Lahib stayed on well in the closing stages and finished second, two and a half lengths behind the winner Selkirk. On 16 June at Royal Ascot, Lahib was reunited with Carson and started 100/30 favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes. His seven opponents were Second Set, Exit To Nowhere (Prix du Muguet), Rudimentary (Sandown Mile), Goofalik (Prix du Chemin de Fer du Nord), Star of Gdansk (third in The Derby), Approach the Bench (Beresford Stakes), Sikeston and Lovealoch. Lovealoch set the pace before Sikeston went to the front three furlongs out. Second Set went to the front inside the final furlong but Lahib, who had been amongst the leaders from the start, stayed on strongly in the closing stages, took the lead in the final strides, and won by a head. In August Lahib was sent to France to contest the Group One Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville Racecourse and finished second of the fourteen runners, a length behind the winner Exit To Nowhere. The unplaced runners included Star of Cozzene, Hatoof, El Prado and Sikeston. On 26 September Lahib was one of nine horses to contest the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot and started the 8/1 fifth choice in the betting behind Selkirk, All At Sea (Prix du Moulin), Marling and Brief Truce. The other runners were Second Set, Mystiko, Hamas and Sharp Review. After tracking the leaders, Lahib overtook the pacemaker Hamas two furlongs from the finish and was \\"driven out\\" by Carson to win by two lengths from Brief Truce with Selkirk taking third ahead of All At Sea. On his final racecourse appearance, Lahib was moved up in distance for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket on 17 October. Starting at odds of 2/1 in a ten-runner field, he took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish but was overtaken inside the final furlong and beaten a neck by Rodrigo de Triano. Stud record Lahib was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at his owner's Derrinstown Stud. He was briefly based at the Scarvagh House Stud before moving to the Old Road Stud in Tallow, County Waterford in 2009. His best offspring have included Vicious Circle (Ebor Handicap), Super Tassa, Last Resort (Challenge Stakes), Late Night Out (Supreme Stakes), Mus-If (National Stakes), Dutch Gold (Chester Vase), La-Faah (Horris Hill Stakes), River Belle (Mrs. Revere Stakes). He was pensioned from stud duties in 2011 and retired to Derrinstown.

It primarily has occurred within the player community for the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive by Valve, but practice of it exists in other game communities. Valve also runs the Steam marketplace which can be interfaced by third-parties to enable trading, buying, and selling of skins from players' Steam inventories for real-world or digital currency, though Valve itself condemns the gambling practices as it violates the platform's Terms of Service. Valve added random skin rewards as part of an update to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in 2013, believing that players would use these to trade with other players and bolster both the player community and its Steam marketplace. A number of websites were created to bypass monetary restrictions Valve set on the Steam marketplace to aid in high-value trading and allowing users to receive cash value for skins. Some of these sites subsequently added the ability to gamble on the results of professional matches or in games of chance with these skins, which in 2016 was estimated to handle around $5 billion of the virtual goods. These sites, along with Valve and various video game streamers, have come under scrutiny due to ethical and legal questions relating to gambling on sporting matches, underage gambling, undisclosed promotion, and outcome rigging. Evidence of such unethical practices was discovered in June 2016, and led to two formal lawsuits filed against these sites and Valve in the following month. Valve subsequently has taken steps to stop such sites from using Steam's interface for enabling gambling, leading to about half of these sites closing down while driving more of the skin gambling into an underground economy. Counter- Strike: Global Offensive Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a team-based first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment that released in 2012. The game itself was built atop the Counter-Strike mod from 1999 which subsequently built out into a game series by Valve. Players in the game take the role of a terrorist or a counter-terrorist, with each team having a unique goal to complete before they are eliminated by the opposing team or before the timed round is completed. For example, the terrorist team may be required to plant and defend a bomb at a specific site, while the counter-terrorists must eliminate the terrorists before it can be planted, or disarm the bomb once it has been activated. =Skins as a virtual currency= The introduction of the Arms Deal update to Global Offensive in August 2013 added cosmetic items termed \\"skins\\" into the personal computer versions of the game. The developers had considered other types of customization drops for the game before coming to weapon skins; they had ruled out on player skins, since Global Offensive is a first-person shooter and the player would not see their customization, as well as new weapons, fearing this would imbalance the game. Following the model they used for Team Fortress 2, Valve enabled players to be rewarded with random skin drops as they played matches which would be stored in their user inventory within Steam, Valve's software delivery and storefront client. Limited-time \\"souvenir\\" skins could also be earned by watching competitive Global Offensive matches within the game or through a Twitch account linked to a Steam account. Unlike Team Fortress 2, the Global Offensive skins do not have any direct impact on gameplay, only influencing the look of a player's weapon. Skins, unique to specific in-game weapons, are given several qualities, including a rarity that determines how often a player might acquire one by a random in-game drop just by playing the game or as in- game rewards, and an appearance quality related to how worn the gun appeared. These skins were added to try to unify and increase the player size of the community, who were split between Global Offensive, Counter-Strike v1.6, and Counter-Strike: Source. According to Valve's Kyle Davis, the introduction of skins to Global Offensive was to encourage more players for the game by providing them free virtual items simply by playing the game which they could then use as part of the Steam Marketplace to trade with others, boosting the Marketplace's own economy. The Arms Deal update drew an audience back to the game, with a six-fold increase in the average number of players from the previous year about seven months after its release. Initially, Valve had considered skins that appeared as camouflage would be more desirable to help hide on some maps, but found there was more community interest in bright, colorful skins that made their weapons appear like paintball guns. The addition of skins made the game attractive to expert players, as the skins could be taken as a kind of trophy, showing off to other players how serious of a player they were. Valve's CEO Gabe Newell described the offering of skins as an \\"investment\\" that would retain some nominal value well after the player stopped playing the game, though did state that they had concerns about factors that might fall out of their control with this feature. Because of the rarity and other qualities, certain skins became highly sought-after by players. Skins became a form of virtual currency, with some items like special cosmetic knives worth thousands of United States dollars. This virtual currency was further impacted by the game giving out \\"weapon cases\\" that would contain an unknown skin. A case, and discovery of that skin, could only be opened by purchasing a key in the in-game store for $2.49. At the same time, the most common skins that could be earned had a value far less than the cost of the key, so the player would effectively lose money if they bought a key and found a common skin. Because of this, cases also became part of the virtual currency within Global Offensive. Global Offensive is not the first video game where players have traded, sold, or bought virtual in-game items, but the ease of accessing and transferring through the Steam Marketplace made it a successful virtual economy. However, with increased monetary values placed on some skins, the Steam Marketplace became infeasible. The Steam Marketplace only allows sales up to $400, with all transactions subject to a 15% fee collected by Valve. Trades and purchases via the Steam Marketplace required players to add funds to their Steam Wallets to purchase skins from others, with those funds being placed in the Wallet of the seller; such funds could not be taken out as real-world money, as otherwise Valve would be regulated as a bank. As the value of skins grew beyond these limits, new websites opened up that used the Steamworks application programming interface (API) to link players' inventory to these sites as to manage the trading of Global Offensive skins while enabling these users to spend more and receive money through other online banking/payment sites like PayPal or using digital currency like Bitcoin, and bypassing Valve's transaction fee. Skin gambling for Global Offensive grew as the game became popular as an eSport, such as this Major League Gaming event in 2016 The player community for Global Offensive grew quickly following the addition of skins, further enabled by the growth of streaming services like Twitch. Valve promoted features into Global Offensive that made it favorable for professional play (eSports), including sponsoring its own tournament. Several teams arose from high-ranking players, creating viewing opportunities during tournaments; this was further enhanced by the ability for viewers to earn \\"spectator\\" skins simply by watching these matches. Compared to League of Legends, one of the most-watched eSports in 2013, Global Offensive is considered an easier game for spectators to understand and follow, making it more attractive for viewing audiences. Within a year of the Arms Deal update, Global Offensive has seen a significant turnaround in player counts, and is poised to be a major eSport. More than eight million players played Global Offensive by September 2015, and , Global Offensive was one of the top five games watched on Twitch, peaking at more than 525,000 concurrent viewers during a championship round. At the start of 2016, Global Offensive was poised to be the largest growing eSport that year. =Gambling= As Global Offensive popularity as an esport grew with increased viewership, there also came a desire for players to bet and gamble on matches. Outside of the United States, several sites arose to allow users to bet with direct cash funds on the result of matches from games like Global Offensive. Cash gambling on sports, including esports, had been banned in some European countries, and, up through May 2018, in all but four states within the United States under the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA). With the decision in the Supreme Court case Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association that ruled PASPA unconstitutional, states are now free to enable sports gambling, including for esports. American case law has also determined that the use of virtual goods for betting on the outcome of matches is legal and not covered under gambling laws. Companies like Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games have made strong delineations between virtual currencies and real money to stay within these prior rulings while offering betting on matches within their games using strictly virtual funds. Some of the websites created to help with trading of Global Offensive skins started offering mechanisms for gambling with skins, appearing to avoid the conflation with real-world currency. These originated as sites that allowed players to use skins to bet on esport matches. Players would bet one or more skins from their Steam inventory, which are then moved to an account managed by the gambling site. Upon winning, the player would be given back their skins and a distribution of the skins that the losing players had offered. Over time, other sites started to expand beyond esports betting and instead offered betting on games of chance. Jackpot-like sites were introduced, where users can put their skins into the pot, which will end in one person winning. The higher total value, the more chance the user would have to win. A few sites reduced the gambling to betting on the result of a single coin flip. Some sites also offered unopened weapon crates for purchase with skins. In combination with the gambling features, players could then trade skins that they had won for their cash value through these sites, or purchase skins with currency to gamble further. The exact timing for the growth of these gambling sites is unclear, but Chris Grove, an analyst for Eilers & Krejcik Gaming and Narus Advisors, observed as early as August 2015 that skins were being used for betting on esports. At that time, the use of skins for gambling on more traditional games of chance was not readily apparent. These sites have created a type of black market around Global Offensive skins, generally unregulated by Valve. The exact monetary values processed by these skin gambling sites are difficult to measure because of the opaqueness of the ownership. Eilers and Narus estimated that $2.3 billion in skins was used to bet on esports in 2015, $5 billion in 2016, and projected that over $20 billion in skins would be gambled by 2020 if the market was left unchecked. Of the $5 billion in skins during 2016, Eilers and Narus estimated that only $2 billion were used for esport betting, while the rest was used on traditional games of chance. Some individuals are estimated to have a cumulative worth of tens of millions of dollars of skins in their inventories. The effect of Global Offensive gambling is estimated by Esports Betting Report as an \\"eight figure\\" number that feeds the overall area of professional esports as the result of viewership and promotions related to the skin gambling. Several factors led to concerns about the Global Offensive skins market and gambling. The skin gambling mechanisms work toward those predisposed to gambling because of the ready availability of, and ability to acquire, skins within the game, and can yield great rewards, according to UCLA's co-director of gambling studies, Timothy Wayne Fong. This is particularly true for younger players, who constitute a substantial portion of the Global Offensive player base, and who may also be encouraged through peer pressure to obtain unique skins to show off to their friends. With the pressure applied to skin-gambling websites in 2016, some have moved to use skins as part of a cryptocurrency called \\"Skincoin\\", which was launched in June 2017. Skincoin, backed by Ethereum, allows users on the gambling websites to trade skins for Skincoin, which then can be used for gambling or purchasing skins. Other sites arose in 2017 that would allow users to obtain skins for doing \\"free\\" tasks, such as watching ads or advertising these sites through other games. These free skin sites do not have gambling aspects in order that they may appear legal, but users can subsequently take these skins into other gambling sites. Other games While skin gambling and the issues relating to it has been limited mostly to Global Offensive, other games have also seen similar gambling using virtual goods. Valve's multiplayer online battle arena game Dota 2 uses cosmetic clothing and weapon replacements for the playable characters as virtual currency, which have been both traded and used for esports betting on the same sites as for Global Offensive or on similar sites. As drops of these costume elements are far rarer than in Global Offensive, gambling involving them was not seen as egregious as Global Offensive skin gambling, though this form of gambling does suffer from the same ethical and legal issues. Team Fortress 2 virtual goods are also used on various gambling sites, to a lesser extent. Similar black markets and gambling sites exist for games in the FIFA series by Electronic Arts, starting with the FIFA Ultimate Team feature in FIFA 2013, in which players would use virtual coins, purchased with real-world funds, to create a team based on real-world FIFA players. Though players are able to trade virtual athletes with one another, the mechanisms involved have led to third-party gambling sites that operate on the same principle as does Global Offensive skin gambling. At least one such case against the sites that offer this type of gambling has been prosecuted. Eve Online, a persistent massively multiplayer game that includes an in-game economy driven by players rather than by its developers, CCP Games, has had issues with virtual-item gambling that imbalanced the player-driver economy. Notably, in an event called \\"World War Bee\\" in 2016, numerous players worked with a player-bankrolled casino to acquire enough in-game wealth and assets as to strip control from the reigning player faction in the game. Following the conflict, players from the affected faction noted potential legal issues with this in-game casino that would run afoul of European gambling laws if minors were involved, as well as how they affected the game's balance beyond what CCP had envisioned. CCP discovered that alongside these casinos there was also virtual-item gambling that involved real-world finances, practices that were against the game's terms of service. In October 2016, in anticipation of making Eve free-to-play, CCP altered its end-user license agreement terms to disallow any type of gambling using in-game assets, and later banned the accounts of those involved in the gambling scheme, effectively seizing in-game currency, estimated to be worth $620,000 in real monetary value. Issues and criticism Skin gambling contributed greatly to the success of Global Offensive as an esport, but some argued that it needed to be regulated to avoid legal and ethical issues. Most of the discussion and action on skin gambling resulted from a video posted by YouTube user \\"HonorTheCall\\" in late June 2016. HonorTheCall had observed some allegations of questionable Global Offensive promotion through his Call of Duty videos, and, in searching in publicly available information, discovered evidence of unethical practice by one gambling site, which he documented in this video; subsequently, several media outlets took the initial evidence and reported more in-depth on the matter. Skin-gambling sites have attracted a number of malicious users. When roulette-like websites were created, browser extensions claiming to automatically bet for the user were actually malware designed to steal skins and coins. While gambling using virtual items falls within acceptable practice in US case law, the fluidity between virtual goods and currency, enabled by the Steam Marketplace, makes it unclear whether skin gambling is legal under US law and if Valve would be liable. As of 2016, United States gambling laws, which include the Illegal Gambling Business Act (a component of the Organized Crime Control Act), the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, the Federal Wire Act, and the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, do not explicitly cover the gambling of virtual goods in esports, though it may be argued that such laws could be easily modified to include virtual goods. Further, the ease of accessibility of skin-gambling websites has enabled underage gambling. Justin Carlson, the creator of skin-selling online marketplace website SkinXchange, said underage gambling is a huge issue, and that there were \\"countless times\\" when he has called parents to tell them that their children had used their credit cards to buy items. Carlson cites cases in which underage users have bet hundreds or thousands of dollars, just to end up losing them on a betting or jackpot site. Many skin-gambling sites do not explicitly declare their ownership and may be operated by offshore agencies, leading to issues involving transparency and promotion. Some of these sites are located in countries that do not have restrictions on gambling, putting them outside of law enforcement in some countries. In early July 2016, the video posted by HonorTheCall led to the discovery that one gambling website, CSGO Lotto, was owned by two YouTube users, Trevor \\"TmarTn\\" Martin and Tom \\"Syndicate\\" Cassell, and supported in equity by Josh \\"JoshOG\\" Beaver, none of whom disclosed this relationship in their videos while promoting the website to their subscribers, with some of this promotion paid through Global Offensive skins. This practice was identified as conflicting with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations on promotional videos, though the owners have claimed they are operating within the law. Valve subsequently blocked CSGO Lotto from the Steam services, but a few days later overturned that ban. In September 2017, in what the FTC called its first settlement with \\"social media influencers\\", the FTC arranged an agreement with Martin and Cassell requiring them to disclose any business ties with their videos in the future or face more drastic action; this agreement was finalized in December 2017. The FTC also updated its guidelines in how product endorsement relates to social media in light of this situation. The lawyer representing Martin and Cassell said that CSGO Lotto should not be classified as a gambling site, as through its fine print, it allows users to participate without having skins by simply requesting entry tickets for its events, similar to the manner in which McDonald's Monopoly promotions are run. A similar situation was discovered in relation to YouTube user PsiSyndicate (later called PsiSyn), who promoted the site SteamLoto without disclosure while being paid for the promotion in rare skins. The site CSGO Wild, in announcing its closure in response to Valve's cease-and-desist letters, revealed it had promoted members of FaZe Clan who had previously neglected to reveal this promotion in their videos. At least one member of FaZe Clan has since updated his video archives to include a message regarding the CSGO Wild promotion following this announcement. There have been claims of match rigging between some skin-gambling sites and players. The site CS:GO Diamonds has admitted to providing at least one player with inside information to help make the resulting matches more exciting to draw viewers to the site. In January 2015, Valve banned seven professional Global Offensive players from the same team after finding evidence that they were match fixing in association with skin-gambling site CS:GO Lounge during a major competition. Valve warned that professional Global Offensive players and event organizers \\"should under no circumstances gamble on Global Offensive matches, associate with high volume Global Offensive gamblers, or deliver information to others that might influence their Global Offensive bets\\", threatening to exclude players who may even be suspected of such interactions. Despite this discovery, CS:GO Lounge continued to remain active, and later that year announced its sponsorship of a professional Global Offensive team, raising questions of its legitimacy. Government responses On October 5, 2016, the Washington State Gambling Commission ordered the company to \\"immediately stop allowing the transfer\\" of skins for \\"gambling activities through the company's Steam Platform\\", giving the company until October 14 to submit notice of compliance or otherwise face legal repercussions, which may include criminal charges. The commission had previously contacted Valve in February over issues with the practice, specifically focused on issues relating to the use of the Steam API that enabled the third-party websites. Valve's reply re-asserted it was not involved with these gambling sites and did nothing wrong under state law, further asserting that most of the Steam service features used by the gambling sites are primarily designed to be used to facilitate legal and acceptable practices for other users, and thus cannot directly shut down these services without impacting the bulk of other Steam accounts using the services legally. Valve continued it had offered to cooperate with the state to identify those Steam accounts being used for gambling sites and shut them down for violation of its end-user license agreement terms, and would continue to do so. The Federal Trade Commission is evaluating whether some of the Global Offensive players that have promoted these gambling sites have violated appropriate disclosure rules, however, the commission has not yet issued a formal statement regarding their investigation. In 2016, Australian senator Nick Xenophon planned to introduce legislation that would classify games like Global Offensive, Dota 2, and other games with virtual economies with the option to use real currency to buy items with random or different value (as in the Global Offensive weapon cases) as games of chance. Under this proposed law, such games would be regulated under gambling laws, requiring them to carry clear warning labels and to enforce age requirements to play. Xenophon stated that these games \\"purport to be one thing\\" but are \\"morphing into full-on gambling and that itself is incredibly misleading and deceptive.\\" The Norwegian Gambling Authority, which oversees all gambling operations within Norway, deemed skin gambling of any form to be illegal in March 2017, and will take action against operators of skin-gambling websites within the country. The government of the Isle of Man enacted licensing conditions in February 2017 permitting online-gambling operators to allow players to deposit, gamble with and withdraw virtual items such as skins. This is performed under strict regulation to ensure that all gambling is done using certified random number generators (RNGs) and that no minors participate. This was seen as potentially restoring the skin-gambling market after the 2016 incidents. In August 2017, the United Kingdom's Gambling Commission opened an investigation into skin gambling. The commission has successfully prosecuted two owners of a UK website that promoted virtual-goods gambling related to FIFA games on charges of advertising unlawful gambling and encouraging underage gambling. The commission published its report in December 2017, finding that 11% of 11-to-16-year-old children in the UK had participated in skin gambling, in part as the result of the lack of safeguards against underage use on skin-gambling sites. The commission announced that it is prepared to take criminal action, but that is needs the assistance of parents and game companies to enforce underage-gambling rules. In February 2018, the Danish government blocked access to six skin-gambling sites following a court case between the Danish Gambling Authority and two Danish telecommunication companies. The court ruled that since the skin-betting sites were promoted at a site in the Danish language, they were required to have permission from the Danish Gambling Authority. The telecommunication companies had initially refused to comply with the demand by the Danish Gambling Authority to block access to the sites on grounds of principle, which led to the case going to court. The same court case also outlawed 18 other gambling sites not involved with skin gambling. With concerns over loot boxes in late 2017, the Dutch Gaming Authority reviewed several games with loot boxes, found them to violate the Netherlands' gambling laws, and issued letters to publishers of several unnamed games in April 2018, giving them eight weeks to correct the loot box or face fines or criminal charges. On the June 20, 2018 deadline, Valve disabled Global Offensive and Dota 2 item trading for users within the Netherlands to comply with the Gaming Authority's order. At the Gambling Regulators European Forum conference in September 2018, members from 15 European nations, as well as the American state of Washington, announced a collaborative effort to address the \\"risks created by the blurring of lines between gaming and gambling\\", with the primary focus to be on third-party websites that offer skin-gambling features. Legal actions =Lawsuits= In June 2016, Valve was sued in the State of Connecticut by resident Michael John McLeod. The lawsuit cites \\"illegal gambling\\" issues \\"knowingly\\" created by Valve and three of the trading sites, CSGO Diamonds, CSGO Lounge and OPSkins, including potential gambling by minors, stating that Valve not only provides the currency in the form of skins for gambling, but also profits from the resulting trades when such skins are won. McLeod's lawyers are seeking to treat this as a class-action lawsuit once proceedings begin. A second lawsuit, also filed as a class-action, was initiated against Valve, Martin, Cassel, and CSGO Lotto by a Florida mother in July 2016 shortly after the CSGO Lotto discovery. This suit states that Valve enables gambling by minors and users such as Martin and Cassel promote this, all considered illegal activities under federal racketeering laws and Florida consumer protection laws. ESPN outlined the story of Elijah Ballard, one of the 44 plaintiffs in the case, who had become addicted to skins gambling when he was twelve years old, using his parents' credit cards and bank accounts to purchase skins. Jasper Ward, a lead counsel in both cases, undertook the lawsuits due to his current involvement in the legal investigation into gambling issues with DraftKings and FanDuel, sites that allowed players to bet on fantasy teams. Ward stated that Valve \\"created and is profiting from an online gambling ecosystem that, because it is illegal and unregulated, harms consumers, many of whom are teenagers\\". Ward noted that, as of a July 6, 2016 interview, Valve had not issued a response to either case, and believed that the company's \\"public silence [...] is unconscionable\\", particularly in light of them unbanning CSGO Lotto. Part of both suits asserted there were Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) violations at play, requiring part of the suit to be heard at the Federal Circuit Court. The presiding judge in the first case ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to vacate this aspect of the case in October 2016, stating that \\"gambling losses are not sufficient injury to business or property for RICO standing\\". Valve successfully lobbied to transfer the case to a federal court in Seattle in August 2016, and subsequently had the case dismissed on juridical grounds in November. The plaintiffs attempted to refile in King County Superior Court in Seattle, but Valve also lobbied this to federal court and similarly received juridical dismissal. The plaintiffs were joined by additional plaintiffs in Washington and Illinois and filed in federal court in Seattle; the new filing includes the actions of the Washington State Gambling Commission as part of its assertions. Similarly, the second case against CSGO Lotto was kicked out of federal courts on the same RICO arguments, and was refiled in Florida state courts where CSGO Lotto was incorporated. Ward noted that Martin had moved out of the United States to the United Kingdom around the time the lawsuits had been filed, making it difficult to see any legal action towards him. In April 2019, the Quinault Indian Nation in Washington state filed a lawsuit against Valve, alleging that despite their steps to prevent gambling using skins, continues to run Global Offensive with the intent to profit from skin gambling, making them run afoul as an unlicensed gambling business, and because of its size, gains a significant advantage over the licensed gambling that the Quinault have. =Reactions by Valve and others= Shortly after the second lawsuit above, Valve's Erik Johnson stated in a July 13, 2016, letter to Gamasutra that they will demand the third-party sites that use Steam functionality to aid in gambling to cease their use of Steam in that manner, as their methods of connectivity and use go against Steam's acceptable use policy. Johnson also stated that Valve has no business relationships with these sites, and will pursue legal action if they continue to violate their service terms. On July 20, 2016, Valve followed by issuing several cease and desist letters to 23 sites they believed involved in skin gambling that were inappropriately using their services, giving them ten days to discontinue use of the Steamworks API. Another 20 sites were issued similar cease and desist notices by Valve a week later. The same month, Twitch warned its users that streams depicting or promoting Global Offensive gambling sites were in violation of its terms of service, which forbids streams that depict content which violates the terms of service of third-parties. As a result, Twitch banned James Varga, also known as \\"PhantomL0rd\\", the highest-viewed Global Offensive player on Twitch with over 1.4 million followers at the time, asserting the ban was for violating their terms of service, though did not clarify further for the specific reasons. This ban had followed a few days after yet-proven allegations regarding Varga's connections to a skin gambling site were made public. Shortly after, Varga announced that he had obtained legal counsel to fight his Twitch ban, and filing a formal lawsuit against Twitch for it in February 2018, seeking monetary damages due to having his streaming career impacted by the ban. Twitch filed a countersuit in May 2018, arguing that Varga violated terms and conditions of using the site, and seeks compensatory damages for harm that Varga had created for Twitch and its users. In the wake of Valve's statement, several of the gambling sites either went dark, closed off the use of the site by United States residents, or formally announced their closure, such as CSGODouble. Valve warned users that they should move any skins they have transferred to such sites back to their Steam inventory, while several affected sites have promised users they will automatically return skins in the near future. One site, OPSkins, remained active, saying in a statement that they were not a gambling site and do not anticipate Valve would take action against them as a result. CSGO Lounge had announced plans to obtain legal gambling licenses in the countries it plans to operate within, and restricting access to users from countries with these licenses. However, the site announced the following month that they were shutting down all virtual item gambling, offering users an opportunity to recover their virtual items, while shifting to a general eSports entertainment website. By January 2017, only about half of these sites contacted by Valve had been shut down, with more off-shore sites being set up around the time. Further, the newer skin gambling sites have kept low profiles, making skin gambling more of an underground economy that is more difficult to track. Around the same time, Valve announced that they were going to take similar action to block sites and accounts that engaged in gambling using Team Fortress 2 items. In March 2018, Valve extended its Steam storefront policy of a seven-day cooling off period on newly acquired items from trades to apply to Global Offensive skins; this was done purposely to target skin gambling and trading sites which depend on the immediacy of being able to trade items, without disrupting fair trades between players. This was met with criticism from players, particularly those that have run legitimate community trading sites and streamers that offer skins for viewers, and a petition with over 100,000 signatures had been started to have Valve review this decision. Shortly afterwards, OPSkins had launched ExpressTrade, a site that used bots to automate some of the trading functions as to effectively bypass the seven- day period. Valve sent a cease & desist letter to OPSkins demanding they shut down ExpressTrade for violating Steam's Terms of Service, and subsequently, when OPSkins failed to act, deactivated the accounts of the bots used by ExpressTrade. Users from Reddit estimated that over worth of skins were lost from this shutdown, which included about $1 million in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds skins that had been locked in the system when the PUBG Corp, which publishes the game, opted to lock skin trading when they saw their skins being used in skin gambling. Valve has had to take other steps to limit the use of Steam's features to advertise skin gambling sites. After it was found that these gambling sites were creating simple mods for users to download via the Steam Workshop feature for CS:GO and other games primarily as a means of promoting their sites, Valve instituted Workshop moderation for these games, requiring human review of the content and denying those that were not appropriate. Similarly, some sites have taken to Steam's review feature on other games; a review is written which primarily serves to promote a skin gambling site, and then various bot-enabled accounts rapidly vote that review up, which not only highlights the site advertisement, but elevates the game's presence in Steam so that the review will more likely be seen. When detected, Valve has removed such reviews as well. In October 2019, Valve removed the ability for CS:GO container keys to traded or resold and tying purchased keys to the buyer's account, as they had found that nearly all such container keys were being used to support the grey market of skin gambling and real-world money laundering. Impact The revelations of several problems with skin gambling during June and July 2016 highlighted the nature of gambling as a significant problem for eSports. Todd Harris of Hi-Rez Studios, a developer of several eSports games, believed that these events signaled the end of an era where eSports went mostly unregulated, requiring publishers and tournament operators to exert tighter control on their games to reduce gambling problems. Psyonix, the developers of Rocket League, announced plans to bring a similar loot-drop and trading system to their game as with Global Offensive, but purposely opted not to use the Steamworks API to manage player inventory, seeking to avoid a similar situation with gambling that happened with Global Offensive. Brendan Greene, lead designer for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, believed that by mid-2017, Valve had put enough safeguards in place to use the Steam marketplace to manage the trading and selling of cosmetic items for Battlegrounds without worrying about skin gambling. However, by November 2017, several Battlegrounds skin gambling sites of questionable legality began to appear. PUBG Corp, the developers behind Battlegrounds, disabled Steam trading in May 2018 as they found players were still abusing the system. As there is still a desire to gamble on eSports, programs are being developed to use completely virtual currencies that have no monetary value to avoid the skin gambling issues. For example, in September 2016, Twitch announced plans to offer a virtual currency, known as \\"Stream+\\", to users of their platform which would as act as points within a loyalty program. The points can be earned by watching streams, and a user would be able to bet on eSport matches with them. When the existence of the skin gambling situation was discovered in mid-2016, estimates for the economics of skin gambling market had dropped, but by early 2017, these analysts found the market did not drop as much as they expected, and with gambling sites still open and growing, they do not expect to see this diminish in the near future unless the legal matters are resolved. Analysis firm Naruscope estimated in early 2017 that even with increased awareness of the legal ramifications of skin gambling, there could be as much as $12.9 billion gambled this way by 2020, compared to their previous estimate of $20 billion made in mid-2016. Grove places much of the future of skin gambling on Valve and its control over the Steam API that enables the third-party websites; Valve had stated that changing the API to cut off these websites would also affect other legal activities that could be performed with it, making it difficult to enforce without more direct oversight and monitoring by Valve. It is unclear if the two lawsuits against Valve will come to a full trial, and thus attention is being placed on the Washington State Gambling Commission's pending actions to resolve the situation.

Dodo was originally from Konz, above Trier at the confluence of the Moselle and Sauer rivers. Dodo had taken the cross and joined in the First Crusade and was lucky enough to return unscathed along with his wife, a countess of Chiny. Cons-la-Grandville was a commune of Meurthe-et-Moselle in what is now northeastern France on the river Chiers. Dodo was a benefactor of the abbey of Saint-Hubert to which he donated the priory of St Michael. His father, Adelo was master of the castle of Dun on the Meuse which had been given to the church of Verdun by Emperor Henry IV. On Adelo's death his lands were divided between his sons Walter, who received Dun, and Dodo who received Cons. Dodo was a crusader who was one of the many leading knights from Walloon and the Lotharingian territories that joined the army of Godfrey of Bouillon in the First Crusade. These included Godfrey's brothers and their cousin Baldwin of Le Bourg, Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut, Rainald (or Reinhard), Count of Toul, Warner, Count of Grez, Baldwin of Stavelot, Peter of Stenay, and the brothers Henry and Godfrey of Esch. Dodo was known to have been at the siege of Nicaea in 1097. Dodo married Hadvide of Chiny, daughter of Arnold I, Count of Chiny. Murray identifies her as \\"Hadwida, daughter of Arnulf II of Chiny\\" but such different spellings are common in historical documents. The confusion about the numbering is rampant among the counts of Chiny and Looz, especially once the countships merged. Even before that, Arnold I and Arnold II, who were counts of Looz before the merger with the counts of Chiny, were often confused with each other. Dodo and Hadvide are not known to have had any children, although a son named Quino has been attributed to Dodo. Hadvide accompanied her husband on the First Crusade. It is unclear what her role was during the crusade, but she did procure a complete set of vestments in black cloth and gold trim, and a chalice made of gold and adorned with jewels. These were donated to the monks of St. Hubert-en-Ardenne, named in honor of Hubert, Bishop of Liege, patron of archers, dogs, mathematicians and metal workers. Many of the original places of worship still exist at St. Hubert. The relic , which dates to the twelfth century, may include elements of this chalice. The vestments are not known to have survived.

It was once the largest paper manufacturer in the world. History The company was founded in 1969 as the James River Paper Company by Brenton Halsey and Robert Williams, with the purchase of Ethyl Corporation's Specialty Papers Division. Halsey and Williams were both former employees of Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company; the city of Richmond lies along the James River. The company changed its name to the James River Corporation in 1973, and it acquired the Dixie/Northern division of American Can Company in 1982. In 1986, James River acquired the fine paper mill assets of Crown Zellerbach, headquartered in San Francisco, and became the largest paper manufacturer in the world. The brown paper division of CZ was not in the deal and became Gaylord Container Corporation. Crown Zellerbach had been the target of a hostile takeover by Sir James Goldsmith. James River began producing 100 percent recycled paper products in 1991 at its mill in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Some of the products included Recycled Northern Bath Tissue, Recycled Brawn Towels, and Recycled Northern Napkins. Also that year, the company sold twenty-two paper mills to Specialty Coatings Group. In 1997, the company merged with the Fort Howard Paper Company of Green Bay, forming the Fort James Corporation. At the time of their merger, James River was one of the largest paper manufacturers, with 60 manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe. In 1998, Halsey and Williams, the company's founders, were both inducted into the Paper Industry International Hall of Fame.

He writes books and magazine articles demonstrating how to tie saltwater fly patterns, primarily focused on warm-water fish and fly fishing from standup paddleboards. Biography = Early life = Chicone grew up in upstate New York, where he learned how to tie flies at the age of six from his parents.; the first fish he caught with a fly he tied was a Landlocked Salmon. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in business from Hartrwick College in 2001. =Writing career= Sanibel Cannibal saltwater fly pattern from Feather Brain Chicone started his fly tying business in 2008, followed by publishing a monthly email newsletter in 2012 with the desire to \\"spread the word about new or unique materials, techniques and patterns.\\" He is a contributing writer for Patagonia, and is a member of the Outdoor Writers Association of America. A number of his articles with his patterns and fly tying instructions have appeared in fishing and fly tying magazines including USA Today Hunt & Fish, Fly Tyer, Fly Life Magazine and Salt Water Sportsman as well as smaller fly fishing and fly tying magazines. He has appeared on ESPN 99.3 Reel Talk Radio and was profiled in Fly Tyer Magazine, which called him ed the \\"reigning king of fly tying methodology\\" .. In 2013, Stackpole Books published his first book, Feather Brain: Developing, Testing, and Improving Saltwater Fly Patterns, which provides step-by-step instructions and photos for tying 14 flies that he designed. The book received endorsements from industry peers Jonny King and the late Eric Leiser. Chicone's largest book, Top Saltwater Flies (Wild River Press),consists of a species-specific book for each of bonefish, permit and tarpon. The work is nearly 900 pages , reportedly the largest book written on the topic of fly tying. Most of his later books are self-published species-specific guides with instructions and photographs for tying fly designs created by Chicone and other designers or professional fly fishermen, sometimes combined with interviews with the original creator. = Fly tying = Chicone's theory for creating effective fly designs revolves around his study of baitfish habits and movements through the water, that he attempts to replicate in his designs. Some peers regard his approach to fly design and tying methods as unique. Some of his designs have been regarded as effective by peers, won industry awards and included in books by other authors. Chicone is or has been on many pro teams including Dyna-King, Nautilus, Hardy, Whiting Farms, Daiichi, Mustad, and Loon. He's sponsored by Patagonia, CTS Fishing, Dyna-King, and Airflo. = Other professional endeavors = Chicone is an ambassador for the American Museum of Fly Fishing, a member of the Tarpon and Bonefish Trust, and plays an active role in the preservation of local fisheries. He has also invented materials and tools for fly tying which are sold by Hareline Dubbin. Some of Chicone's fly patterns which have been commercially tied and sold by Orvis & Umpqua Feather Merchants. He works as a fly casting instructor and has been credited with a casting method called the misdirection cast. =Family= Chicone lives in Fort Myers, Florida with his wife and daughter.

Spacecraft specification  Major changes from previous Kounotori include: * Inclusion of HTV Small Re-entry Capsule (HSRC), described below. * Reduction of primary batteries to five units, down from six of Kounotori 6, seven of Kounotori 2 through Kounotori 5. * Replacement of Hardware Control Panel (HCP) by Portable Computer System (PCS). HCP was a dedicated control command box which allowed ISS crew to send control commands to Kounotori. For Kounotori 7, this is to be replaced by a portable (laptop) computer. To enable HSRC retrieval, the destructive re-entry of Kounotori 7 and the splashdown of HSRC is planned to take place in the northwestern Pacific Ocean near Minami-Tori-shima (Marcus Island), east of Bonin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands, instead of the southern Pacific Ocean used by the previous missions. = Reentry capsule = Along with resupplying the ISS, this Kounotori flight tested the HTV Small Re-entry Capsule (HSRC), a reentry capsule similar in function to the VBK-Raduga carried on board Progress flights to the Mir space station. Essentially a miniaturized HTV-R capsule, it was carried in the pressurized section of the vehicle. After departing from the station, ground control will remotely command Kounotori to release the capsule at an altitude of . The capsule incorporates nitrogen cold gas reaction control system with 3D printed nozzles, and autonomously performs attitude control to mitigate shock during descent. Splash-landing off the coast of the Ogasawara Islands, the capsule will be retrieved by ship. It was then airlifted to Ibaraki Airport via Minami-Tori-shima, from where the samples was delivered to researchers. The capsule can contain a total of 20 kg of material (5 kg if the payload requires refrigeration). The capsule has a diameter of 84 cm, a height of 66 cm, and a mass of less than 180 kg. Tiger Corporation developed the capsule's double vacuum insulated container by applying technology used in vacuum flasks. Some samples produced in the microgravity environment of the ISS deteriorate easily, thus a quick return to the surface is desired. For this demonstration flight, samples including ISS-manufactured protein crystals are planned to be placed inside. On 22 October 2015, a high-altitude drop test of the capsule was successfully conducted off the coast of Taiki, Hokkaido. A second test was conducted on 21 September 2016, with conditions and parameters closer to the actual capsule than the previous year's test. The third and fourth drop tests were done in July and November 2017, respectively.  Cargo  Kounotori 7 carries about 6200 kg of cargo, consisting of 4300 kg in the pressurized compartment and 1900 kg in the unpressurized compartment. Cargo in the pressurized compartment (PLC) include: * NASA EXPRESS Rack 9B and 10B * NASA Life Sciences Glovebox (LSG) * ESA Life Support Rack (LSR) * JAXA HTV Small Re-entry Capsule (HSRC), and a specifically designed hatch of the pressurized compartment to mount the HSRC on departure from ISS. * JAXA experiment Loop Heat Pipe Radiator (LHPR) * CubeSats to be deployed into orbit from ISS: SPATIUM-I, RSP-00, STARS-Me In the Unpressurized Logistic Carrier (ULC), Kounotori 7 carries 6 lithium-ion batteries Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) for replacing the ISS's existing nickel-hydrogen batteries. The transportation of replacement batteries is a continuation from the previous Kounotori 6, and will continue through to Kounotori 9.  Operation  = Launch and rendezvous with ISS = Initially Kounotori 7 was scheduled to launch at 22:32 UTC on 10 September 2018, but was postponed due to bad weather forecast at a ground tracking station. It was rescheduled to 13 September 2918 at 21:20 UTC, but adverse weather forecast at the launch site pushed one day further to 14 September at 20:59:14 UTC. During the preflight check, a problem was found in the blowoff valve of the launch vehicle second stage oxygen tank, and the launch was scrubbed. After the problem was resolved, the launch was rescheduled to 21 September 2018 at 18:15 UTC. Bad weather forecast pushed it one day to 17:52 UTC on 22 September 2018. The H-IIB launch vehicle carrying Kounotori 7 launched at 17:52:27 UTC on 22 September 2018. It arrived at the proximity of International Space Station on 27 September 2018, and the station's Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) grappled it at 11:36 UTC. = Operation while berthed to ISS = Exposed Pallet (EP), which carries the replacement batteries for ISS, was extracted from Kounotori's Unpressurized Logistics Carrier (ULC) by the SSRMS (Canadarm2) and transferred to the Mobile Base System (MBS) Payload/Orbital Replacement Unit Accommodations (POA) on 28 September 2018. Due to the launch failure of Soyuz MS-10, planned extravehicular activity to replace the batteries of ISS could not be performed while the Kounotori 7 was berthed to ISS. The Exposed Pallet will remain at the ISS after departure of Kounotori 7. = Departure from ISS and reentry to the Earth atmosphere = Kounotori 7 was demated from Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) of Harmony module by SSRMS at 23:32 UTC on 6 November 2018, and it was released into orbit on 7 November 2018, 16:50 UTC. After a series of trajectory control manoeuvres, the final deorbit burn completed at 21:14 UTC, on 10 November 2018. Separation of HTV Small Re-entry Capsule (HSRC) from Kounotori 7 was confirmed at 21:24 UTC. Estimated time of the reentry to Earth atmosphere (at 120 km altitude) of Kounotori 7 was 21:38 UTC, and the splashdown of residual debris at 21:48 - 22:12 UTC. Splashdown of HSRC was confirmed at 22:06 UTC, and it was retrieved by the recovery ship at 02:25, on 11 November 2018. The ship arrived at Minami-Tori-Shima on 19:50 UTC, on 12 November 2018. The retrieved specimen was transported by aircraft to Ibaraki Airport, and finally arrived at Tsukuba Space Center on 13 November 2018, at 00:42 UTC.

Operation  = Launch = The H-IIB launch vehicle carrying Kounotori 8 was initially scheduled to be launched at 21:33:29 UTC, 10 September 2019. During launch preparation, a fire broke out at the launch pad at around 18:05 UTC (T minus 3.5 hours), and the launch was called off. The cause of fire was attributed to the static electricity on the heat resistant material under the mixture of liquid oxygen and gas oxygen for the engine pre-cooling. After the modification to the mobile launch platform to suppress static electricity, a new launch was scheduled at 23 September 2019, 16:30 UTC, but the collision avoidance check revealed that the 2nd stage of the launch vehicle might approach near the Soyuz MS-15 which was scheduled to be launched on 25 September 2019. A revised launch schedule was set for 16:05 UTC, 24 September 2019. On 24 September 2019, 16:05:05 UTC, the Kounotori 8 aboard H-IIB was launched successfully. = Operation while berthed to the ISS = Kounotori 8 was captured by the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) at 23:13 UTC, on 27 September 2019, and berthed at Harmony's nadir Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) by 17:55 UTC, on 28 September 2019. The External Palette (EP8), which carries the lithium-ion battery Orbital Replacement Units (ORU), was extracted from the Kounotori 8's Unpressurized Logistics Carrier (ULC) by the SSRMS (Canadarm2) on 29 September 2019. The External Palette of Kounotori 7 (EP7) was placed in the Kounotori 8's ULC. . EP7 was left on the ISS after the departure of Kounotori 7 due to the schedule change of extravehicular activity after the launch failure of Soyuz MS-10. = Departure and reentry to the Earth atmosphere = On 1 November 2019, Kounotori 8 was detached from Harmony's CBM by the SSRMS (Canadarm2), and it was released into orbit at 17:20 UTC.

In addition Ephwurd has remixed some of the biggest names in dance music including The Chainsmokers, Major Lazer, DJ Snake and Oliver Heldens. Ephwurd has toured worldwide playing festivals such as Lollapalooza, Electric Daisy Carnival & Veld among many others. History Ephwurd went public with a remix of Major Lazer & DJ Snake's \\"Lean On\\", before revealing who was behind the duo in July 2015 as they released the single \\"Rock the Party\\" on the Spinnin' Records label. The collaborative effort between Ephwurd and Jauz would often get played by DJs such as Ti√´sto, Axwell/Ingrosso, and Skrillex. The music style would later be known as \\"bass house\\", which has been described as \\"having a lot of classic house drums and percussion to it but it has the wobbles of dubstep at the same time\\". Ephwurd later released a slew of singles on labels such as Spinnin Records and its sub label affiliates. On March 16, 2018, Bais Haus announced that \\"Ephwurd will now operate without Datsik.\\", due in part to the recent controversy surrounding Datsik.

Not all infected cows get sick ‚Äì some shed the disease without becoming ill, allowing for transmission between farms if apparently healthy cows are moved. Signs and symptoms =Mastitis= Gangrenous mastitis in a cow, Day 10; green arrow : complete necrosis of the teat; yellow arrows : limits of the gangrenous tissue, but the necrotic area is not well delimited on the upper part of the udder Mastitis can cause a decline in potassium and lactoferrin. It also results in decreased casein, the major protein in milk. As most calcium in milk is associated with casein, the disruption of casein synthesis contributes to lowered calcium in milk. The milk protein continues to undergo further deterioration during processing and storage. Milk from cows with mastitis also has a higher somatic cell count. Generally speaking, the higher the somatic cell count, the lower the milk quality. =Bovine respiratory disease= In early bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cases, the lungs and airways are generally painful, so the animal will try to clear the airway with mild, tentative, soft coughing. Fever of over is one of the earliest signs of BRD. * Depression * Lack of appetite * Dullness * Respiratory signs: ** Rapid, shallow breathing ** Coughing =Arthritis= Cattle affected by arthritis have difficulty in moving, including getting up and swelling in joints. Some outbreaks have many lame calves while others have none affected calves. While, some calves have swollen joints, that are so painful that they will reluctant to walk to the feed and water bunks. In rare cases, calves can have spinal issues, tiredness, irritability, muscle atrophy, licking, chewing and biting. Prevention There are many ways by which cattle can be prevented from catching Mycoplasma bovis and other pathogenic bacteria. =Transport of animals= Animal transport vehicles should be cleaned with disinfectants before and after use. Environmental swabs should be taken and samples sent to a microbiology lab. If any harmful bacteria are detected, further action should be taken. =Visitors= Only authorized people should be allowed to visit a farm. Visitors should arrive with clean clothing and footwear. Disinfectant on arrival and departure can reduce the spread of bacteria. For example, a water mat with disinfectant can be used in the entrance of the farm. =Weekly inspection and maintenance= Weekly cleaning of all the areas and equipment reduces the chances of animals getting sick. Also, it is important to clean the feedlot container and keep the feed dry. Doubling the boundary fence with a 6-inch gap prevents the animals contacting neighbouring animals. Diagnostics Mycoplasma bovis can be analyzed with culture, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or serology. It is difficult to culture because of slow growing and special agar is needed. Therefore PCR is most commonly used and also serology. A collaboration between six different European laboratories (CoVetLab) showed that the different in- house PCR that were used worked well A European interlaboratory trial to evaluate the performance of different PCR methods for Mycoplasma bovis diagnosis The CoVetLab project also evaluated three different serological methods and found that two of them were performing well A European inter- laboratory trial to evaluate the performance of three serological methods for diagnosis of Mycoplasma bovis infection in cattle using latent class analysis History and taxonomy Mycoplasma bovis was first isolated in the United States from the milk of a mastitic cow in 1961. It was initially described as Mycoplasma agalactia var bovis by Hale and colleagues, on the basis of biochemical reactions and its association with bovine mastitis. Later work, based on serological responses and DNA homology studies confirmed that the new Mycoplasma was a different species and renamed it Mycoplasma bovis As of June 2017, only two OECD nations (New Zealand and Norway) were considered to be free of Mycoplasma bovis, but in July 2017 some cattle near Oamaru, New Zealand were found to be Mycoplasma bovis positive; see 2017 Mycoplasma bovis outbreak. Loss to economy There are only estimated economic losses in two continents due to Mycoplasma bovis. The estimated loss in Europe due to Mycoplasma bovis is approximately ‚Ç¨576 million per year. The total loss in the United States is estimated to be $108 million. US losses due to mastitis, lack of the weight gain and diminished carcass value are valued at $32 million. It is very expensive for the government and the farmers to control Mycoplasma bovis. Also, it affects the production of milk and the cost for treatment is high. Because cows are the main source of income to most of the farmers, many governments have to reimburse the farmers for loss of income and stock value, which affects the economy. Treatment Mycoplasma species have unusual characteristics for bacteria. Unlike other bacteria they can live in cultures outside cells and they lack a cell wall. Some antibiotics work by damaging cell walls so these do not work on Mycoplasma species. However, they can be killed by antibiotics such as tetracyclines, macrolides or erythromycin which do not act on the cell wall. Draxxin (Tulathromycin) and Resflor Gold are the only drugs approved for treating Mycoplasma bovis in cattle but Florfenicol (Nuflor) and Batril can also be used. The normal duration of the treatment is 10‚Äì14 days by antibiotic therapy. =Vaccination= Several vaccines are available: Pulmo-GuardMpB, Mycomune Mycoplasma Bovis bacterin, and Myco-BacTM B.

In 1846, he began practice in Hackensack and was made a counsellor in 1850. He was married in 1850 to Anna Mattison and they resided in Hackensack. Knapp was initially appointed to act as prosecutor for the state and in 1851 Governor George Franklin Fort appointed him for a full term after which he remained the position in successive appointments until 1861. In 1875, when Joseph D. Bedle was elected governor, he appointed Knapp as his successor on the bench of the Supreme Court, his judicial district covering the counties of Hudson, Bergen and Passaic. Hudson County was made a separate district at which he continued until his sudden death on January 26, 1892 while presiding over the court in Jersey City.\\"JUSTICE KNAPP IS DEAD; HIS LIFE BROUGHT SUDDENLY TO A CLOSE YESTERDAY.
